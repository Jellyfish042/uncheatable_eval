      "Canada has announced plans to again delay an expansion to its medical assistance in dying (maid) programme for people who have a mental illness.\n",
      "It comes after a parliamentary committee recommended a pause on the expansion, which was originally set to come into effect on 17 March.\n",
      "Ottawa had also been warned by the provinces that they had not had time to properly prepare.\n",
      "Legislation was tabled on Thursday to delay the expansion to 2027.\n",
      "The government \"has heard - and agrees - that the health system is not yet ready for this expansion\", Health Canada said in a statement.\n",
      "Concerns have been raised by provinces across the country, which oversee healthcare services, about whether the system is ready and robust enough to handle the expansion.\n",
      "Speaking on Thursday in Ottawa, federal Health Minister Mark Holland said the government accepts the equivalency of mental suffering and physical suffering, but that it is a \"question of readiness\".\n",
      "He said his provincial counterparts, as well as Canada's largest mental health hospital - the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) - \"feel that they need more time to be able to look at this\".\n",
      "CAMH has previously said that doctors and nurses are concerned they are not yet adequately trained to determine whether someone with mental illness qualifies for euthanasia.\n",
      "The legislation Mr Holland tabled allows for a review in two years to reassess the readiness of the system.\n",
      "The expansion has been delayed twice. Last year, the country paused it for one year, to this March.\n",
      "Advocacy group Dying with Dignity said on Thursday it was \"disheartened\" over this second pause, calling it a \"denial of constitutional rights for suffering people across Canada\".\n",
      "In 2021, Canada loosened its euthanasia laws to no longer require that a patient's condition be terminally ill, allowing people whose condition is serious and incurable to request it.\n",
      "The number of medically-assisted deaths in Canada has risen significantly since it was first introduced, from 1,018 in 2016 to more than 13,241 in 2022. That year, maid deaths accounted for about 4.1% of all deaths in the country.\n",
      "Authorities rejected 3.5% of written requests for euthanasia in Canada in 2022, the most recent available statistics.\n",
      "The average age across the country for individuals seeking medically assisted dying in that year was 77 years old, with cancer being the most cited underlying medical condition for those looking to die.\n",
      "The province of Quebec has the highest percentage of medically-assisted deaths, accounting for 6.6% of all deaths in 2022.\n",
      "Last year the province's end-of-life care regulator, Dr Michel Bureau, sent a memo to doctors reminding them that only patients with serious and incurable diseases were eligible for maid, and that two physicians must approve a request to die before it is granted.\n",
      "\"We see, more and more, that the cases receiving medical aid in dying are approaching the limits of the law,\" Dr Bureau, president of Quebec's commission on end-of-life-care, said in an interview with the Canadian Press in 2023.\n",
      "\"It's no longer just terminal cancer, there are all kinds of illnesses - and that's very good, but it requires a lot of rigour from doctors to ensure they stay within the limits of the law.\"\n",
      "Other countries, like Belgium and the Netherlands, have allowed euthanasia for psychiatric patients since 2002, but under exceptionally stringent conditions.\n",

      "US President Joe Biden has approved sanctions on four Israeli settlers accused of attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\n",
      "Mr Biden signed a broad executive order, saying violence in the West Bank had reached \"intolerable levels\".\n",
      "The sanctions block the individuals from accessing all US property, assets and the American financial system.\n",
      "Violence in the West Bank has spiked since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October.\n",
      "Some 370 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since then, according to the UN. The majority of those have been killed by Israeli forces but at least eight of them have been killed by Israeli settlers, the UN said.\n",
      "The new executive order means the US government has the power to sanction any foreign nationals who attack, intimidate or seize the property of Palestinians.\n",
      "The sanctions are a first by the US administration - a rare step targeting Israelis - and comes as Mr Biden travels to the state of Michigan, which has a large Arab-American population that has been critical of his support for Israel.\n",
      "The Arab American Institute, an advocacy group, earlier said that since the start of the conflict, support by Arab Americans for the Democratic Party has plummeted from 59% in 2020 to just 17%.\n",
      "On Thursday, a senior official in the Biden administration said the president had repeatedly raised concerns with Israel about violence by settlers.\n",
      "The executive order sets out the groundwork for how the US will respond to further attacks in the West Bank, and is an escalation compared to the visa restrictions it imposed on some individuals last year.\n",
      "\"The situation in the West Bank - in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction - has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security and stability\" of the region, Mr Biden said in a letter to Congress explaining his reasoning.\n",
      "A senior administration official said the initial round of sanctions - targeting four people - were against \"individuals that have directly perpetrated violence and those who have engaged in repeated acts of intimidation, property destruction, leading to the forced displacement of Palestinian communities\".\n",
      "They said one person initiated and led a riot that led to the death of a Palestinian civilian in the town of Huwara, while another had attacked people with stones and clubs.\n",
      "They added that the executive order was \"non-discriminatory\" and applied to both Israelis and Palestinians who direct or take part in violent acts or threats against civilians, intimidation, destroying, seizing property or terrorism.\n",
      "The US Treasury named the four sanctioned Israelis as David Chai Chasdai, 29; Yinon Levi 31; Einan Tanjil, 21; and Shalom Zicherman 32. Three of them lived in West Bank settlements and one lived near the occupied region's border, the Treasury said.\n",
      "These US sanctions cannot be applied to American citizens, some of whom are thought to be involved in the violence.\n",
      "State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the US does believes the sanctions \"will have an impact on these four individuals\" and expects Israel to \"do more to hold accountable those responsible for settler violence\".\n",
      "Shortly after Mr Biden signed the executive order, Israel signalled its dissatisfaction and described the majority of West Bank settlers as \"law-abiding\".\n",
      "\"Israel takes action against all law-breakers everywhere, and therefore there is no need for unusual measures on the issue,\" a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.\n",
      "The response was yet another sign of a deepening public rift between the US and Israel.\n",
      "The two leaders are long-term allies, but have disagreed in recent weeks about the idea of creating an independent Palestinian state. The US believes a Palestinian state alongside Israel - known as a \"two-state solution\" - is vital for long-term stability in the region.\n",
      "Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea, and the White House acknowledged last month that the US and Israeli governments \"clearly see things differently\".\n",
      "Those comments dampened hopes in some circles that the conflict could result in Israeli and Palestinian leaders restarting diplomatic negotiations and kickstarting the dormant peace process.\n",

      "Hollywood stars Henry Cavill and Samuel L Jackson aren't easily upstaged, but it was Claudia Schiffer's cat who stole the show at a film premiere.\n",
      "Dua Lipa, Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston and Bryce Dallas Howard were among the stars attending the launch of spy film Argylle in London's Leicester Square.\n",
      "But Schiffer brought along her cat Chip, who appears in the film and hoovered up all the media attention.\n",
      "Photos from the night were posted to Chip's 13,000 followers on Instagram.\n",
      "The cat could be seen through a perspex dome in Schiffer's argyle-patterned backpack cat carrier - complete with plenty of air holes.\n",
      "These backpacks are custom-made so cats can be transported safely - cat owners inspired by Schiffer and Chip should not put their pets into ordinary backpacks.\n",
      "Other stars at the London premiere included John Cena, Ariana DeBose, Sofia Boutella, Rob Delaney, Jing Lusi, Matthew Vaughn.\n",
      "Vaughn, who has been married to Schiffer since 2002, directed the film, which is released in the UK next month.\n",
      "In the film, Chip plays the role of Alfie, the cat belonging to spy novelist Elly - played by Howard.\n",

      "The Spanish region of Catalonia has declared a state of emergency as it faces its worst drought on record.\n",
      "From Thursday residents will be banned from washing their cars and filling up empty swimming pools under a measure brought in to tackle the crisis.\n",
      "More than six million Catalans will be affected across 200 towns and cities, including the capital Barcelona.\n",
      "The restrictions were announced after reservoirs fell to close to 16% of their capacity.\n",
      "\"It's still not raining,\" Anna CasÃ²liva Freixe told the BBC, looking out of the window of her bakery. \"It's worrying if you don't have enough water.\"\n",
      "Anna lives and works in Berga, a town high up in the mountains north of Barcelona which has been hit hard by the drought.\n",
      "\"We need water to make bread - we need water to make the dough,\" she said. \"But we need it at home as well: for the washing machine, to shower and so on.\"\n",
      "Spain is familiar with dry conditions and other areas of the country are also suffering droughts, including Andalusia in the south and the eastern region of Valencia.\n",
      "However, Catalonia, which borders southern France, is less used to such conditions, forcing officials to consider bringing in water by ship to Barcelona should it run dry. This measure was previously adopted in 2008.\n",
      "Other initial emergency restrictions will include a sharp reduction in the use of water for crop farming and industry, and the capping of water supplies per inhabitant per day.\n",
      "Town halls can face fines for flouting these limits and there is scope for the restrictions to be increased further.\n",
      "Just a few kilometres away from Berga, the impact of the drought is all too visible. The la Baells reservoir, along with others in the Ter-Llobregat basin system, provides water for Barcelona and dozens of surrounding towns.\n",
      "Its currently filled far below capacity, with its parched banks exposed.\n",
      "\"Barcelona and its surrounding area are home to five or six million people and that population density makes it a very vulnerable area,\" Anna Barnadas, secretary for climate action in the Catalan government, told the BBC.\n",
      "She said that a Catalan government drought strategy, drawn up in 2021, had already diversified the region's water supply, making it less reliant on reservoirs and wells. Some restrictions on water use have already been in place.\n",
      "Such measures, Ms Barnadas said, allowed the authorities to delay the emergency measures.\n",
      "\"We realise that the state of emergency affects all sectors, it affects the whole population and so it means, in this case, introducing some major restrictions,\" she said.\n",
      "\"It has been a priority for us to delay the state of emergency but it is impossible to avoid it.\"\n",
      "Ms Barnadas said it was too soon to be able to know whether the drought could be attributed to climate change, although the Catalan government believes that to be the case.\n",
      "Climate change does not cause all droughts, but increased heat in the atmosphere exacerbates dry spells. Temperatures in the Mediterranean region are increasing 20% faster than the global average, according to the UN and rises are expected to continue unless there are drastic cuts to emissions.\n",
      "In Barcelona itself, the drought's impact is less visible than in the nearby mountains. But decorative fountains in the city have been switched off for the last year, and the watering of public and private gardens is mostly prohibited.\n",
      "\"I try to save water in my daily life, having quick showers and this kind of thing,\" one local resident, Silvia MartÃ­nez, told the BBC.\n",
      "\"But I'm afraid this this is going to be something that is normal in the future.\"\n",
      "Barcelona's status as Spain's top tourist destination raises the question as to how it would handle the high season if the drought were to continue into the summer. More than 12 million people visited the city in 2023 and Marta DomÃ¨nech i TomÃ s, director general of tourism for the government of Catalonia, told the BBC that 2024 could see even more visitors.\n",
      "She said that the region was \"really well prepared\" to receive tourists despite the drought and that the industry was making adjustments to adapt to the shortage of water.\n",
      "Hotels have been taking measures which range from informing guests about the need for careful water use, to installing water counters in bathrooms and encouraging guests to reuse sheets and towels.\n",
      "However, the mood among many Catalans is that things will get worse before they get better.\n",
      "\"It's one of those things where they've been warning us for some time but we don't take much notice, and so we carry on with our normal lives,\" said local man Pep Soler, as he headed to work in central Barcelona.\n",
      "He added: \"We're too used to certain privileges which aren't altogether necessary and we need to reduce how much water we use.\"\n",

      "The council has completed an internal review and said the move would increase \"decision-making transparency\".\n",
      "But the papers will only be made public once auditors have completed their own investigation.\n",
      "Woking Borough Council effectively declared itself bankrupt in June, saying it could not balance its budget.\n",

      "Joanne Brown, director of public sector assurance at Grant Thornton LLP, said it had concluded the fieldwork and was finalising a report, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).\n",
      "She said the company had to consult with interested parties before the report could be published, which she appreciated \"may be frustrating for residents of Woking, the council and other stakeholders who are keen to see the report's findings\".\n",
      "However, \"the approach we are following is both important and necessary,\" she added.\n",
      "The documents, which contain commercially sensitive information, are usually confidential.\n",
      "In a statement, the council said it was publishing the historic papers so people could better understand the decisions and actions that had contributed to its current financial challenges.\n",

      "The US economy grew faster than expected in the final months of last year, driven by robust household and government spending.\n",
      "The world's largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% over the three months to December, the Commerce Department said.\n",
      "That was down from 4.9% in the prior quarter, but much faster than the 2% many analysts had expected.\n",
      "For 2023, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.5%, up from 1.9% in 2022.\n",
      "The figures cap a year that has been characterised by unexpected economic resilience, even as the US central bank raised borrowing costs sharply and inflation cooled.\n",
      "\"Whichever way you slice it, this report caps a year of stellar economic growth performance,\" said Olu Sonola, head of US regional economics at Fitch Ratings. \"The momentum of economic growth going into 2024 is looking very good.\"\n",
      "The figures are a boon for US President Joe Biden, who has struggled to convince the public that the economy remains healthy, as it downshifts from the boom after the pandemic shock.\n",
      "In a speech in Wisconsin on Thursday, he argued that White House policies, including investments in green energy, roads and other infrastructure, have contributed to the resilience.\n",
      "\"Experts, from the time I got elected, were insisting that the recession was just around the corner,\" he said. \"Well, we've got really strong growth.... We obviously have more work to do but we're making real progress.\"\n",
      "Mr Biden said he believed the message was starting to get through.\n",
      "In recent months, surveys have shown consumer sentiment improving. The stock market is up, petrol prices are down and unemployment remains low.\n",
      "While the jump in prices since 2019 remains a sticking point for voters, the inflation rate has also eased, falling to 3.4% in December, after soaring to more than 9% in 2022.\n",
      "California resident Ha Le said she was conscious of no longer being on a constant lookout for the lowest cost petrol.\n",
      "But the 44-year-old, a corporate worker in the retail industry and a Democrat, said it was still difficult to accept the big jump in grocery and child care prices of the last few years.\n",
      "\"My general thoughts on the economy are that it's not the worst, right? We've recovered somewhat from the pandemic terror, but it's not great,\" she said.\n",
      "Many economists had expected households to cut back spending as prices eroded their budgets and for business activity to cool in the face of more expensive borrowing costs, warning of the risks of a downturn, or recession.\n",
      "But that scenario has not materialised, as high savings left over from the pandemic, an uptick in wage growth, and other government spending provided a cushion. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, the US economy grew 3.1%.\n",
      "On Wall Street, the improving picture has led to speculation that the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates sharply to fight inflation, might start to reverse course.\n",
      "But analysts said the strength of the economy portrayed in the report on gross domestic product (GDP) will relieve pressure on the bank to act quickly.\n",

      "It might not look like a spectacular photograph, but the snapshot was taken with what is called the Multi-Band Camera or MBC, which can essentially capture images that reveal the composition of the rock.\n",
      "\"The camera responds differently - in different wavelengths - to each of the minerals that are in this rock,\" explained Open University lunar scientist Dr Simeon Barber.\n",
      "Seeing that will enable scientists to build up a picture of the Moon's history. \"If toy poodle is completely different to the rocks around it, that might suggest it was transported there by an impact event,\" explained Dr Barber. \"So all this detail allows us to piece together more about what's happened on the Moon since it was formed.\"\n",
      "Being able to pinpoint rocks and examine them in this way could also reveal substances on the lunar surface that future missions might be able to use to make fuel or provide a water supply.\n",
      "\"This detailed geology is the cherry on the icing on the cake,\" said Dr Barber. \"[The mission is] already a success in my mind - I think engineering so far has been fantastic.\"\n",
      "It is not yet clear how long the craft will be able to operate - it all hinges on the angle of the Sun and solar panels.\n",
      "The Sun will eventually set on the lander and Jaxa has previously warned that it was not designed to survive a lunar night, when the surface of the Moon is not exposed to the Sun for about 14 days.\n",
      "But mission engineers have already achieved their pinpoint landing target of getting within 100m (330ft) of their intended landing site.\n",

      "In 2015, a law was passed to do just that, but it has never been put into practice.\n",
      "One major problem is that if you devolve a tax and then cut it, as Stormont ministers intended, you will be sending less money to the UK Treasury.\n",
      "So in turn the Treasury will cut the block grant - the money it sends to Northern Ireland for public services.\n",
      "Stormont and the Treasury were never able to agree how big that cut should be or it how should be implemented.\n",

      "The question remains - will the Treasury be prepared to cut a deal which doesn't involve a raid on the block grant?\n",
      "Northern Ireland is also getting an investment zone - this is a \"levelling up\" policy which provide grants and tax breaks to a region.\n",
      "It is understood the zone will cover all of Northern Ireland, though the tax breaks will be more narrowly focused.\n",

      "Often, they are added to their parents' policy as a named driver even though they are the main driver of the car.\n",
      "The Association of British Insurers (ABI) says a main driver just has to be the person who drives the car the majority of the time.\n",
      "An IFB survey last year revealed a quarter of 18 to 24-year-olds would find it acceptable to lie on an insurance application to save money - although many may be aware that fronting is illegal.\n",
      "\"With prices rising, we understand more young people will be tempted to front on their car insurance to save money, but fronting is never worth the risk,\" Jon Radford, head of intelligence, investigations and data services at the IFB, said.\n",
      "Lucy, 17, from Leeds told the BBC she was shocked by the quotes she received after passing her driving test in December.\n",
      "\"They were just outrageous,\" she said. \"Some of them were just silly - one was for Â£9,000.\"\n",
      "To overcome the costs Lucy's mum took out a Â£2,800 policy on the car and added her daughter as a named driver.\n",
      "While her mum does drive the car, Lucy uses it for college during the week and to get to her weekend job.\n",
      "Her mum Andrea told the BBC she had never heard of fronting before, but believes she and her daughter share the car equally.\n",
      "\"We had no other option,\" she said. \"We did look at putting it in her name, we asked the question of the insurance company and this is what they came back with.\"\n",
      "Lucy said she was aware of fronting. \"Obviously it's a concern, but once I've done my A-levels my mum will be driving the car to work and I will have it on weekends so she will be the main driver.\n",
      "\"At the moment there's not really anything I can do. It's either that or I don't drive.\"\n",
      "While Lucy would like her own policy, she added: \"Everyone's in the same position. Being a named driver is the only way anyone can afford to do this.\"\n",
      "Insurance for young drivers often outstrips the cost of a second-hand car, the usual vehicle for those who have just passed their test. These costs may be having an impact.\n",
      "The numbers of driving tests being taken by young people has dropped in recent years.\n",
      "In 2019-20, before the first lockdown of the pandemic, 520,505 tests were taken by 17 and 18-year-olds, according to the Driving Vehicle Standards Agency. But in 2022-23 that figure fell to 504,718.\n",
      "However, there is no data on what is behind the drop and whether it has anything to do with costs or is simply a hangover from the driving test backlog accumulated during and after Covid.\n",

      "Paul from West Lothian told the BBC that when his 17-year-old daughter Danni passed her driving test, the firm she had her provisional insurance with refused to transfer the policy.\n",
      "\"The car became an ornament,\" he said.\n",
      "The 59-year-old hunted around and took out a Â£3,600 policy in his name and added his daughter as a named driver with a black box.\n",
      "Without the car she would have an eight-mile trip to college, which would otherwise take two bus journeys with \"times that are all over the place\", he said.\n",
      "Now Danni drives herself to college although the car is also driven by both parents. \"I'm sure we're not doing anything illegal,\" Paul said.\n",
      "However, his concern is that costs have become so prohibitive that people will start driving without insurance.\n",
      "\"Absolutely, that is a worry,\" he said. \"What I want to know is, why can't we have a system of insurance like they have in Australia, where the car is insured and not the person?\n",
      "In every state in Australia compulsory third-party insurance is paid as part of vehicle registration, although this only covers injuries to other people and not damage to other vehicles. Other third-party policies and comprehensive policies are optional and can be added by the owner.\n",

      "When Valdo Calocane was handed a hospital order for killing three people in Nottingham and attempting to kill others, it prompted a furious response from the victims' families.\n",
      "As well as questioning the sentence passed down, they have raised concerns about interactions the killer had with health services and the police prior to the attacks, as well as how the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) handled the case.\n",
      "Why was Calocane sentenced for manslaughter, and not murder?\n",
      "Calocane had originally been charged with three counts of murder and three of attempted murder.\n",
      "However, while in custody, it emerged he had been transferred to a \"secure hospital setting\" and assessed by three forensic psychiatrists.\n",
      "They all agreed the 32-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attacks, which \"impaired his ability to exercise self-control\".\n",
      "The CPS \"took the unusual step\" of asking a fourth expert to review those reports, and after they agreed with the findings, prosecutors concluded there was \"no realistic prospect of conviction for murder\".\n",
      "Calocane's plea of manslaughter on the basis on diminished responsibility was submitted on 28 November , and accepted by prosecutors on Tuesday.\n",
      "The decision to accept surprised many who assumed he would face a murder trial.\n",
      "James Coates, the son of school caretaker Ian Coates - who was stabbed to death on his way to work - said Calocane had \"made a mockery of the system\" and \"got away with murder\".\n",
      "Following sentencing, the CPS said: \"Diminished responsibility is only a partial defence to murder. It is for the defendant to prove that it applies.\n",
      "\"In this case, the evidence that Valdo Calocane's actions and self-control were significantly impaired by paranoid schizophrenia, a serious mental health condition, was compelling.\"\n",
      "Who was supposed to be looking after Calocane?\n",
      "Nottingham Crown Court heard Calocane's mental illness began in 2019, and he had been detained under the Mental Health Act at a psychiatric unit in Nottingham four times since May 2020.\n",
      "On each occasion, he was discharged - the final time in February 2022.\n",
      "He was prescribed anti-psychotic medication but stopped taking it, which the prosecution said led to a further decline in his mental health.\n",
      "Dr Sanjoy Kumar, the father of victim Grace O'Malley-Kumar, said: \"While we have never questioned this man's diagnosis, the lack of toxicology, contemporaneous mental health assessment, as well as missed opportunities to divert his lethal path will forever play on our minds and this requires further review.\"\n",
      "Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said it had \"robustly\" reviewed its interactions with Calocane.\n",
      "Chief executive Ifti Majid said: \"If a patient no longer engages with our services and support and they do not meet criteria to be detained under the Mental Health Act, they are discharged back to the care of their GP and can be referred back into our services at any time.\"\n",
      "NHS England is planning a major investigation into the case.\n",
      "Why was Calocane not arrested, despite a warrant being issued?\n",
      "It has emerged officers from Nottinghamshire Police had failed to detain Calocane after an arrest warrant was issued in September 2022, when he failed to appear in court following an assault on an officer.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Assistant Chief Constable Rob Griffin said: \"I have personally reviewed this matter and we should have done more to arrest him.\n",
      "\"However, because of the circumstance prevailing, at the time of the alleged assault, in my opinion it is highly unlikely that he would have received a custodial sentence.\n",
      "\"Of course, an arrest might have triggered a route back into mental health services, but as we have seen from his previous encounters with those services, it seems unlikely that he would have engaged in this process.\"\n",
      "This led Emma Webber, mother of victim Barnaby Webber, to tell Mr Griffin he had \"blood on his hands\".\n",
      "It has also been confirmed that while he was wanted for assault, Calocane was reported to police for attacking two workmates at a warehouse but was not arrested .\n",

      "Search for \"AI investing\" online, and you'll be flooded with endless offers to let artificial intelligence manage your money.\n",
      "I recently spent half an hour finding out what so-called AI \"trading bots\" could apparently do with my investments.\n",
      "Many prominently suggest that they can give me lucrative returns. Yet as every reputable financial firm warns - your capital may be at risk.\n",
      "Or putting it more simply - you could lose your money - whether it is a human or a computer that is making stock market decisions on your behalf.\n",
      "Yet such has been the hype about the ability of AI over the past few years, that almost one in three investors would be happy to let a trading bot make all the decisions for them, according to one 2023 survey in the US.\n",
      "John Allan says investors should be more cautious about using AI. He is head of innovation and operations for the UK's Investment Association, the trade body for UK investment managers.\n",
      "\"Investment is something that's very serious, it affects people and their long-term life objectives,\" he says. \"So being swayed by the latest craze might not be sensible.\n",
      "\"I think at the very least, we need to wait until AI has proved itself over the very long term, before we can judge its effectiveness. And in the meantime, there will be a significant role for human investment professionals still to play.\"\n",
      "Given that AI-powered trading bots may end up putting some highly-trained but expensive human investment managers out of work you might expect Mr Allan to say this. But such AI trading is indeed new, and it does have issues and uncertainties.\n",
      "Firstly, AI is not a crystal ball, it cannot see into the future any more than a human can. And if you look back over the past 25 years, there have been unforeseen events that have tripped up the stock markets, such as 9/11, the 2007-2008 credit crisis, and the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "Secondly, AI systems are only as good as the initial data and software that is used to create them by human computer programmers. To explain this issue we need a little history lesson.\n",
      "Investment banks have actually been using basic or \"weak AI\" to guide their market choices since the early 1980s. That basic AI could study financial data, learn from it, and make autonomous decisions that - hopefully - got ever more accurate. These weak AI systems did not predict 9/11, or even the credit crisis.\n",
      "Fast-forward to today, and when we talk about AI we often mean something called \"generative AI\". This is far more powerful AI, which can create something new and then learn from that.\n",
      "When applied to investment, generative AI can absorb masses of data and makes its own decisions. But it can also work out better ways to study the data and develop its own computer code.\n",
      "Yet if this AI was originally fed bad data by the human programmers, then its decisions may simply get worse and worse the more code it creates.\n",
      "Read additional stories on artificial intelligence\n",
      "Elise Gourier, an associate professor in finance at the ESSEC Business School in Paris, is an expert in the study of AI going wrong. She cites Amazon's recruitment efforts in 2018 as a prime example.\n",
      "\"Amazon was one of the first companies to get caught out,\" she says. \"What happened was that they developed this AI tool to recruit people.\n",
      "\"So, they're getting thousands of CVs, and they thought we're just going to automate the whole process. And basically, the AI tool was reading the CVs for them and telling them who to hire.\n",

      "US politicians have called for new laws to criminalise the creation of deepfake images, after explicit faked photos of Taylor Swift were viewed millions of times online.\n",
      "The images were posted on social media sites, including X and Telegram.\n",
      "US Representative Joe Morelle called the spread of the pictures \"appalling\".\n",
      "In a statement, X said it was \"actively removing\" the images and taking \"appropriate actions\" against the accounts involved in spreading them.\n",
      "It added: \"We're closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed.\"\n",
      "While many of the images appear to have been removed at the time of publication, one photo of Swift was viewed a reported 47 million times before being taken down.\n",
      "The name \"Taylor Swift\" is no longer searchable on X, alongside terms such as \"Taylor Swift AI\" and \"Taylor AI\".\n",
      "Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video of someone by manipulating their face or body. A study in 2023 found that there has been a 550% rise in the creation of doctored images since 2019, fuelled by the emergence of AI.\n",
      "There are currently no federal laws against the sharing or creation of deepfake images, though there have been moves at state level to tackle the issue.\n",
      "In the UK, the sharing of deepfake pornography became illegal as part of its Online Safety Act in 2023.\n",
      "Democratic Rep Morelle, who last year unveiled the proposed Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act - which would have made it illegal to share deepfake pornography without consent - called for urgent action on the issue.\n",
      "He said the images and videos \"can cause irrevocable emotional, financial, and reputational harm - and unfortunately, women are disproportionately impacted\".\n",

      "\"What's happened to Taylor Swift is nothing new,\" Democratic Rep Yvette D Clarke posted on X. She noted that women had been targeted by the technology \"for years\", adding that with \"advancements in AI, creating deepfakes is easier & cheaper\".\n",
      "Republican Congressman Tom Kean Jr agreed, saying that it is \"clear that AI technology is advancing faster than the necessary guardrails\".\n",
      "\"Whether the victim is Taylor Swift or any young person across our country, we need to establish safeguards to combat this alarming trend,\" he added.\n",

      "Tests number three and number five involved removing the Irish Sea border.\n",
      "The DUP argues that frontier has now gone because the deal secures the free flow of goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.\n",
      "In truth there will still be some checks and paperwork but they will be greatly reduced and are unlikely to affect internal trade.\n",
      "Stormont brake\n",
      "Another key test involved giving people in Northern Ireland a say in making the laws under which they are governed.\n",
      "The DUPs say a mechanism already agreed in Windsor Framework known as the Stormont brake will come in to play ensuring local politicians can veto any new EU rules.\n",
      "But ultimately it will be up to the government in London to deploy that veto.\n",
      "To ensure there's no new regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK - test number six -  the deal commits the government to screen new laws to ensure they don't impact on Northern Ireland's place in the UK.\n",
      "The final test calls for a constitutional guarantee that Northern Ireland's place within the UK will be preserved. This again falls under the legislation agreed in the deal.\n",

      "By the time he was in the car, the radio was reporting the worst.\n",
      "A Chinook helicopter had crashed in the Mull of Kintryre in Scotland after leaving Northern Ireland. There had been no survivors.\n",
      "It was 2 June 1994. His father Det Supt Ian Phoenix and 28 other people had lost their lives.\n",
      "\"It just sort of floored me and I had to stop the car,\" he told BBC News NI.\n",
      "\"My friend, who was with me, had to take over and drive me home.\"\n",
      "It was the worst peacetime accident in the history of the RAF. On board were leading security personnel from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), MI5 and the Army.\n",
      "They had been travelling to a security conference in Inverness, just two months before the 1994 IRA ceasefire.\n",
      "Now the crash - the exact cause of which remans unknown - and the controversial investigations that came in its aftermath are the subject of a new two-part BBC Northern Ireland documentary, Chinook: Zulu Delta 576.\n",
      "The documentary looks at the ongoing impact of what happened that day, from the devastation caused to family members to the inquiry that blamed the pilots, sparking a two-decade campaign to successfully clear their names .\n",
      "Niven, who contributed to the documentary, said his father joined the RUC after a stint in the Army, rising through the ranks to become a detective superintendent in Special Branch.\n",
      "His father could be strict, said Niven, but that was a reflection of the high-pressure environment of working as a senior police officer in the midst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n",
      "\"We did have a good relationship and we did love each other,\" he said.\n",
      "He remembers the day of the accident vividly - the phone call, in which he was told to go home; asking officers what was going on but getting no further information; the radio report and his friend driving him the rest of the way.\n",
      "He remembers the aftermath too, the comfort found in people walking up the hill to his family's house that night.\n",
      "\"People were very caring, they felt it personally. There was a heavy attachment to the police and military when you're growing up in Northern Ireland, they are often seen as the protectors,\" he said.\n",
      "Speaking about how the family dealt with the passing of his father, Niven said it was a \"long process\".\n",
      "\"It doesn't go away, grief stays with you and your life grows around it. You just have to get on with it and be grateful for the things you did have,\" he said.\n",
      "\"We were very grateful for the time we had with my father, his funeral was probably one of the proudest days of my life, when I saw all the people - and I managed to speak at his funeral as well.\"\n",
      "One thing that struck him even then, he said, was that there were \"worse ways\" for a policeman to die in Northern Ireland at that time than in an accident.\n",
      "From the beginning, he said, his family had no anger towards the crew, believing that \"accidents happen\".\n",
      "Niven was already on the path to becoming a pilot when his father died but believes the crash was a \"formative experience\" for his career going forward in relation to safety.\n",
      "\"My time in the military was coloured by how I viewed the hierarchy in that, for want of a better phrase, I couldn't trust them,\" he said.\n",

      "The RAF was heavily criticised for its board of inquiry's finding that gross negligence on the part of the two pilots was to blame.\n",
      "The two men, Flt Lt Jonathan Tapper and Flt Lt Richard Cook, were eventually exonerated of any blame after a two-decade long campaign led by their families.\n",
      "\"Here in Northern Ireland we are used to families alleging collusion or looking for the truth,\" said Mr Birney.\n",
      "\"This is the very establishment itself, 10 RUC men, six from MI5, four crew and nine from the British Army - if the RAF refused to give them the truth what chances does anyone else have?\"\n",

      "Labour and the Conservatives have been making claims about what is happening to taxation.\n",
      "At the start of what is widely expected to be an election year, they have been talking about the impact of tax changes on \"average\" workers and families.\n",
      "We have been looking at some of their claims.\n",
      "Â£1,200 extra tax for an average family?\n",
      "Launching a new campaign poster on Friday 5 January, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"Working people are worse off under the Tories - Â£1,200 for an average family extra tax this year because of choices by Rishi Sunak and this Conservative government.\"\n",
      "That is not correct. Labour have confirmed that she \"misspoke\".\n",
      "She was talking about tax because National Insurance came down by 2p in the pound from 6 January 2024.\n",
      "But the level of income at which people start paying tax has been frozen - since July 2022 for National Insurance and since April 2021 for income tax.\n",
      "Where does the Â£1,200 come from?\n",
      "Labour confirmed that the Â£1,200 figure came from research by the Resolution Foundation , focusing on living standards.\n",
      "The independent think tank said in November 2023 that taxes would rise Â£1,200 per household by 2028-29 - not this year.\n",
      "This is based on the November predictions by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes forecasts for the government:\n",
      "Of course, not every household will pay Â£1,200. Richer households will pay significantly more - poorer households much less.\n",
      "So what is happening this year?\n",
      "For an employee on average full-time earnings of about Â£35,000, the two factors roughly cancel each other out this year, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).\n",
      "That will not be the case for all workers. Some of those on lower incomes will lose out - some higher earners will gain more than they lose. The IFS says that it is a tax rise overall this year.\n",
      "It is in later years that the increases in taxes outweigh the National Insurance cut for the average earner, as more people start paying tax and start paying higher rates of tax.\n",
      "Paying Â£10 and getting back Â£2?\n",
      "On Friday 26 January, Rachel Reeves tweeted : \"Under Rishi Sunak's Raw Deal, for every extra Â£10 you pay in tax, you only get Â£2 back.\"\n",
      "That was also the message on the poster from earlier in the month, but again it refers to forecasts for 2028-29 and not the current situation.\n",
      "It's another calculation based on the OBR forecasts from November .\n",
      "As mentioned before, the tax increases are predicted to raise an extra Â£44.6bn in 2028-29 while the cut in National Insurance costs the government Â£10bn that year.\n",
      "It means that the tax cut is worth just under a quarter of the increase, which Labour has rounded down to paying an extra Â£10 and getting Â£2 back.\n",
      "Clearly that's not true for every taxpayer - it's an average. The actual impact will depend on income levels.\n",
      "Will the average earner save Â£450?\n",
      "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke about tax cuts in an interview on Friday 5 January. He said: \"We're in a position where we can cut people's taxes. So for a typical parent in work earning Â£35,000, the average salary, then they will get a tax cut worth Â£450.\"\n",
      "He's right about the Â£450 but he is ignoring the effect of the previous tax measures, some of which come into force this year.\n",
      "Here's where the Â£450 comes from:\n",
      "But if the freeze on tax thresholds is taken into account, as we have already mentioned, that average earner will just about break even, according to the IFS.\n",
      "Their analysis finds that even if only the freeze on tax thresholds this April is taken into account (as opposed to freezes going back to 2021), the average earner will still only be Â£130 better off.\n",
      "Some of the points at which people start having to pay other rates of income tax in Scotland will be increasing in April.\n",

      "It had disappeared from our skies altogether in September 2020, having fallen victim not just to Covid but also another disease that has plagued some other state-run carriers - corruption and mismanagement.\n",
      "It may be on the verge of a sale that would see a private consortium take a majority share in the business.\n",
      "However, its handling of finances has recently come in for severe criticism by the country's public spending watchdog.\n",
      "In a scathing report, Auditor-General Tsakani Maluleke said that the financial statements SAA had drawn up dating from the 2018-19 financial year lacked credibility. The airline recorded losses in the four years from 2018 of a staggering $1.2bn (Â£1bn).\n",
      "But interim chief executive officer (CEO) John Lamola said this did not reflect the current position of the airline, which is under new management.\n",
      "He said the situation had improved in the most recent financial year, with the airline now \"running on financial resources generated from its own operations\".\n",
      "Towards the end of last year, in a sign that SAA wants to be a major player again, it reopened its routes from Cape Town and Johannesburg to SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. And now it is selling tickets for flights to Perth, Australia.\n",
      "These are the airline's first long-haul destinations in three years. It did return in September 2021, making a surprise profit serving a limited number of African destinations after coming out of voluntary business rescue.\n",
      "This was a process which saw the airline placed under the temporary supervision of experts who were asked to return the company to financial health. They pared back the fleet from 44 aircraft to six and focused on the African market.\n",
      "Now it is aiming further afield.\n",
      "\"The choice of SÃ£o Paulo was as a result of a very meticulous economic and market research analysis,\" Mr Lamola told the BBC.\n",
      "He added that the intercontinental flights hoped to enhance trade and tourism ties between the two countries as members of Brics - an expanding group of emerging economies originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.\n",
      "Prior to the Covid pandemic, SAA operated five other intercontinental routes from Johannesburg to destinations including New York and Hong Kong.\n",
      "That route encapsulates the prestige that used to accompany the airline. Once the largest in Africa, SAA faced profound challenges in the last decade.\n",
      "\"South African Airways notoriously has gone through a process in South Africa called 'state capture ', where there are well-recorded incidents of corruption that characterised the life of the airline,\" said Mr Lamola, adding that investigations were ongoing.\n",
      "An official inquiry into state capture released at the beginning of 2022 showed that the airline had been wracked by corruption between 2012 and 2017.\n",
      "As a result of the mismanagement, SAA was forced to rely entirely on government financial assistance over a 10-year period to stay afloat, a situation made worse by Covid.\n",
      "\"In that periodâ¦ the government had to put in some 40bn rand ($2.2bn) into SAA,\" said Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan.\n",
      "It had been run at a loss since 2011.\n",
      "The national carrier was placed under voluntary business rescue in 2019 to protect it from bankruptcy.\n",
      "SAA sell-off plan\n",
      "It was then forced to suspend all operations in September 2020, as it struggled to raise a bailout of over $540m.\n",
      "As part of a programme to rescue the airline, the government announced plans, in June 2021, to sell a 51% stake in SAA to a group known as the Takatso Consortium.\n",
      "Under the scheme, the government's department of public enterprises retains the remaining 49% stake, securing a long-term national strategic interest in the airline.\n",
      "Last July, it was approved by the Competition Tribunal of South Africa provided that certain conditions were met.\n",
      "One of the requirements was a moratorium on staff cuts that guarantees job security for SAA employees during the transitional phase.\n",
      "But it has hit problems, with trade unions alleging that proper procedures were not followed. A parliamentary committee plans to subpoena Mr Gordhan to investigate this further.\n",
      "Takatso, with its huge cash injection, had been seen as a lifeline for SAA, but the airline says it will carry on with its expansion plans in the meantime.\n",
      "SAA's new management hopes to shift the business from its dependence on state support to a financially self-sustaining one, by only maintaining a fleet it can afford and pulling out of the low-cost market.\n",
      "\"This airline must be able to survive on operational efficiencies,\" said Mr Lamola.\n",
      "These include choosing routes for commercial rather than political reasons, building a fleet with appropriate long-haul aircraft and matching expansion with the pace of the post-Covid recovery in the global aviation industry.\n",

      "The 21-year-old from Sweden is due to go on trial at a magistrates court in London on 1 February, following her arrest at an environmental protest in October 2023.\n",
      "Who is Greta Thunberg and how did she become a climate activist?\n",
      "Ms Thunberg was born in the Swedish capital Stockholm in 2003. Her mother Malena Ernman is an opera singer, and her father Svante Thunberg is an actor.\n",
      "She first learned about climate change when she was eight.\n",
      "When she was 11 or 12, she started suffering from depression, according to her father, Svante.\n",
      "\"She stopped talking... she stopped going to school,\" he said.\n",
      "Around the same time she was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism.\n",
      "In summer 2018, aged 15, Ms Thunberg held the first \"School Strike for Climate\" outside the Swedish parliament.\n",
      "The protest was widely covered, and hundreds of thousands of young people across the world joined her Fridays For Future strikes .\n",
      "Mr Thunberg says his daughter became \"much happier\" after she started campaigning.\n",
      "She has described her autism diagnosis as a \"superpower\" which helped motivate her protests.\n",
      "\"Being different is a gift,\" she told the BBC . \"If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike.\"\n",
      "Between 2019 and 2020, she took a year out of school to concentrate on activism, and became famous for her impassioned speeches to world leaders.\n",
      "She left school in summer 2023, and ended her school climate strikes .\n",
      "What have been her most famous speeches?\n",
      "In April 2019, aged 16, Ms Thunberg told members of the European Parliament : \"Our house is falling apart and our leaders need to start acting accordingly, because at the moment they are not.\"\n",
      "Five months later, she sailed by yacht across the Atlantic to address a UN climate action summit in New York .\n",
      "\"I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\" she told delegates. \"Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\"\n",
      "Speaking at a youth protest in Glasgow in 2021, after the city hosted the COP26 climate change summit, she said: \"[World leaders have held] 26 COPs. They have had decades of blah, blah, blah - and where has that got us?\"\n",
      "Why is she on trial in the UK?\n",
      "On 17 October, Ms Thunberg was arrested along with four other people at a demonstration near a hotel in central London where an energy conference was taking place.\n",
      "She is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 1 February, accused of a public order offence , which she denies.\n",
      "In 2023, she was twice arrested at the port of Malmo in Sweden while blocking a road used for transporting oil.\n",
      "In July of that year, a court fined her 2,500 krona ($240; Â£187) and in October, she was fined 2,250 krona ($206; Â£168) .\n",
      "What awards has Greta Thunberg won?\n",
      "Ms Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year between 2019 and 2023.\n",
      "In 2019, she became the youngest-ever Time Person of the Year .\n",
      "Also in 2019, she won the Right Livelihood Award (known as the Alternative Nobel Prize) and Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award, and was listed by Forbes as one of the world's 100 most powerful women.\n",
      "In 2022, she brought out The Climate Book, which contains essays from 100 scientists, writers and activists about how to combat the climate crisis.\n",
      "What have Greta Thunberg's critics said about her?\n",
      "At the start of 2023, controversial media personality Andrew Tate baited Ms Thunberg on X, formerly Twitter, by listing his 33 cars and offering to send her details of their \"enormous emissions\" .\n",
      "She responded with a sarcastic tweet which was liked by several million people and shared widely.\n",
      "Shortly afterwards, broadcaster Julia Hartley-Brewer called her \"a half-educated, autistic, doom-mongering eco-cultist,\" in a tweet that she subsequently deleted.\n",
      "She was also mocked on Twitter by former US President Donald Trump when she won the Time magazine award. He said: \"Greta must work on her Anger Management problem... Chill Greta, Chill!\" .\n",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin described her as a \"kind, but poorly informed, teenager\".\n",
      "What has Greta Thunberg's campaigning achieved?\n",
      "Although Ms Thunberg has not devised any specific environmental strategies, she is credited with raising public awareness of climate change across the world, especially amongst young people.\n",

      "Mr Packer, 51, denies a total of 46 charges involving multiple women, including the murder of 27-year-old Ms Caldwell in 2005.\n",
      "The witness - now aged 49 - had previously lived with Mr Packer having initially got to know him in 2012.\n",
      "She was asked on Wednesday about interviews Mr Packer had done with Ms Poling for a documentary about Emma Caldwell's murder.\n",
      "The woman said she had gone with him to the interview but was not allowed to join him while it took place.\n",
      "Prosecutor Richard Goddard asked her about Mr Packer's \"demeanour\" after the second of those interviews in 2019.\n",
      "\"His face was grey. He had walked down to the cafe after 15-20 minutes in the interview,\" she said.\n",
      "\"He was white as a sheet. You could see something had gone badly wrong. It was as if it was all closing in on him.\n",
      "\"He was saying: 'They are blaming me for Emma'. They had kept asking the same questions over and over again.\n",
      "\"My gut instinct was this is not going away.\"\n",

      "\"At the beginning, did he claim to you where he was at the time Emma went missing?\" he said.\n",
      "The woman replied: \"He said he was at home (with a child he knew) looking after her.\"\n",
      "Asked if his \"story\" had later changed, she said Mr Packer commented that he was \"up at work in Aberdeen or something\".\n",
      "Mr Packer's lawyer, Ronnie Renucci KC, later asked the witness about how affected he appeared to be after the interview.\n",
      "He said: \"In effect, you understood he was saying that they were blaming him for Emma Caldwell's murder. If someone is blaming you for that, it is not something that you would take well?\"\n",
      "She replied: \"No.\"\n",
      "Earlier in her evidence, the woman accused Mr Packer of choking her while she lay in bed after an argument.\n",
      "She said: \"I just closed my eyes. I could not move. What else could I do?\n",
      "\"I just froze and waited for it to be over. He had grabbed the windpipe part with two hands and squeezed really, really hard.\"\n",
      "She described Mr Packer's face as being \"totally blank\" while he did this, but then it was as if \"a light switched on\" and he stopped and walked out of the room.\n",

      "Nicola Sturgeon has denied that some of her decisions during the Covid pandemic were motivated by furthering the cause of Scottish independence.\n",
      "The former first minister also rejected claims she presided over a culture of secrecy despite admitting she deleted all her WhatsApps during the pandemic.\n",
      "But she said all \"relevant\" information had been handed to the UK Covid Inquiry.\n",
      "Ms Sturgeon was speaking as she gave evidence to the inquiry in Edinburgh.\n",
      "Ms Sturgeon was asked by Channel 4 News in August 2021 whether she could \"guarantee to the bereaved families that you will disclose emails, WhatsApps, private emails if you've been using them. Whatever. That nothing will be off limits in this inquiry?'\n",
      "The question related to the Scottish Covid Inquiry, which is being held separately to the UK-wide one.\n",
      "She had replied at the time: \"If you understand statutory public inquiries you would know that even if I wasn't prepared to give that assurance, which for the avoidance of doubt I am, then I wouldn't have the ability. This will be a judge-led statutory inquiry.\"\n",
      "But the UK inquiry has been told by Jamie Dawson KC that Ms Sturgeon appeared to have retained no informal messages in connection with her management of the pandemic.\n",
      "It has also been shown exchanges of messages between senior Scottish government officials in which they were reminded that the conversations would be subject to Freedom of Information (FOI) laws and were urged to delete the messages.\n",
      "Opposition parties and survivors groups have accused the government of an \"industrial-scale\" deletion policy in an attempt to avoid scrutiny.\n",
      "However, some Scottish government figures - including Ms Sturgeon's former chief of staff Liz Lloyd and current First Minister Humza Yousaf - have submitted text conversations with Ms Sturgeon to the inquiry.\n",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry on Wednesday morning, Ms Sturgeon - who stepped down as first minister and SNP leader in March of last year - said she exchanged WhatsApps with no more than a \"handful\" of people, and was not a member of any groups.\n",
      "She said her use of the app was \"extremely limited\" and did not relate to \"substantive\" government business.\n",
      "Ms Sturgeon, who became tearful at points during her evidence, said she deleted these informal messages in line with official advice, and \"salient\" points were all recorded on the corporate record.\n",
      "She denied that deleting informal messages meant the Scottish or UK inquiries would be deprived of relevant material about how decisions were made during the pandemic.\n",
      "The ex-SNP leader added: \"There would be nothing in those communications that was not available to either the inquiry or the public, through the record of the Scottish government or indeed in the very detailed public statements that were being made every day.\"\n",
      "The former first minister said she had been trying to answer the \"substance\" of the Channel 4 question but said the \"literal terms\" of her answer may not have matched the question, which referred to the then first minister handing over \"emails, WhatsApps, private emails ... whatever\".\n",
      "\"I accept that and I apologise if that answer was not as clear,\" Ms Sturgeon said. She also conceded that she had already deleted messages relating to the pandemic when she answered that question on 24 August 2021.\n",
      "The ex-SNP leader went on to reject claims from UK government minister Michael Gove that the Scottish government sought \"political conflict\" during the pandemic.\n",
      "Becoming emotional, she insisted \"the idea that in those horrendous days, weeks, I was thinking of political opportunity\" was \"not the case\".\n",
      "Ms Sturgeon insisted \"difficult\" decisions during the pandemic were made based on \"public health reasons\" and she was motivated solely by minimising the harm of the virus.\n",
      "It came after the inquiry was shown an email which voiced concerns that the Spanish government would block an independent Scotland from joining the EU if it did not lift travel restrictions.\n",
      "The email - copied to the first minister and senior government figures - was sent on 19 July 2020 from then deputy first minister John Swinney's email, but signed off by an official named Scott. He said he was \"extremely concerned\" about travel restrictions remaining on the country when there was a low Covid prevalence rate.\n",
      "\"It won't matter how much ministers might justify it on health grounds, the Spanish government will conclude it is entirely political; they won't forget; there is a real possibility they will never approve EU membership for an independent Scotland as a result.\"\n",
      "Ms Sturgeon was also emotional when she said a \"large part\" of her wished she had not been Scotland's first minister during the pandemic.\n",
      "She said her chief regret of the pandemic was that the Scottish government did not introduce a lockdown one or two weeks earlier than it did in March 2020. She also expressed regret over deaths and young people missing out on education.\n",

      "Move Forward is not in government but its campaign promise on changing royal defamation laws violated the constitution, a Thai court has found.\n",
      "Such lese majeste laws have increasingly been used to stifle political criticism, activists say.\n",
      "It is possible all of the party's leaders could be banned from politics.\n",
      "Party leader Pita Limjaroenrat, a young, Harvard-educated politician, had been viewed as a significant threat to Thailand's monarchy by and military-aligned elite, when he won a majority of votes in the 2023 election.\n",
      "His party campaigned on a progressive agenda - and in particular a pledge to amend the controversial lese majeste law, although much of the party's support was for its other proposed reforms.\n",
      "Despite the mandate, Mr Pita's attempts to become prime minister were blocked by the unelected Senate. A coalition made up of other parties eventually formed the government.\n",
      "Last week Mr Pita survived another legal case aimed at disqualifying him from parliament. But he and his party failed to win the crucial second case on Wednesday.\n",
      "The Constitutional Court ruled that Move Forward and its leaders \"demonstrated behaviour\" which amounted to calling for the overthrow of Thailand's democratic system of government with the King as Head of State.\n",
      "It ordered them to stop any acts or expression of views, through any medium, which advocated for the abolition of the lese majeste law. It also prohibited amendments to the law by any means other than \"lawful legislative measures\".\n",
      "That suggests it might be possible to change the law through parliament, but that no public discussion or social media debate will be allowed.\n",
      "The verdict carries no immediate penalty but it is widely expected to be used to justify dissolving Move Forward, and banning its leaders from politics for several years.\n",
      "Given the number of times in Thailand that political parties have been dissolved and leaders banned from politics on much flimsier pretexts, there will now be strong pressure to do the same to Move Forward. Some Thais will conclude that this was always the real objective of the petition to the court.\n",
      "\"I feel that people are being squeezed again,\" political activist Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, told the BBC. \"The Move Forward party just wanted to amend the lese majeste law. They didn't want to reform the monarchy as we proposed.\"\n",
      "In its election campaign the party shied away from activist demands for a complete abolition of the law, calling only for amendment.\n",
      "Move Forward had argued that it was the legitimate role of an elected parliament to scrutinise a law which is part of the regular penal code. Thailand's lese majeste law has already been significantly changed twice.\n",
      "But it is still a powerful tool that is used against dissent, activists say.\n",
      "Earlier this month, a 30-year-old man in Bangkok was sentenced to 50 years in jail for criticising the Thai monarchy.\n",
      "And more than 260 people have been charged under the law since November 2020. It has been used more often since the pro-democracy protests in 2020 that targeted the monarchy, among other things.\n",
      "Four years ago Move Forward's previous incarnation, a party called Future Forward, was also dissolved after doing unexpectedly well in an election.\n",
      "That action by the Constitutional Court set off months of student-led protests , in which unprecedented demands were also made for curbing the king's power.\n",
      "Then in November 2021 the court ruled that three leading activists - including Panusaya - who called for reform of the monarchy during the months-long protests of 2020 had \"hidden intentions to overthrow the constitutional monarchy\", and ordered them to stop.\n",
      "All three have faced multiple criminal charges since then.\n",
      "Many of the other leaders of those protests too still find themselves fighting charges under the lese majeste law, and could face years in prison.\n",
      "Panusaya doesn't think young people will come out on the streets this time.\n",
      "\"No one dares do anything. They see the leaders being put in jail. They know the risk,\" she said. \"I can't help but think that people are more afraid than before. What we see now is only the dark path. There's no way out.\"\n",

      "Appearing on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Ms Badenoch said it was very difficult for someone to be asked to stand down from a position.\n",
      "But, she continued: \"I decided given all of the difficulties the Post Office is having, it's not just about Horizon, it's about the entire business model, how we make it work, that we needed someone who could chair a board that was able to deal with these things effectively.\"\n",
      "She explained that one of her priorities was the governance of the Post Office, and said: \"That was where my deciding that we needed a new chair of the organisation was important. It just wasn't working.\"\n",
      "Ms Badenoch added that there were \"various disagreements\" within the board \"and when I looked at it I thought change of personnel was what was required\".\n",
      "She declined to rule out further personnel changes when appearing on Sky's Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips and referred to \"difficulties\" and other board members.\n",
      "On Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she declined to set a deadline to deliver full compensation for those affected - echoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's position. But Ms Badenoch promised \"we couldn't move any faster than we already have been\".\n",
      "\"Setting a deadline is not the priority,\" she said.\n",
      "\"Getting the money out, getting fair compensation, sorting out the governance of the Post Office, is the critical thing.\"\n",
      "It comes as the Post Office is reeling from the fallout from the Horizon scandal, which has been called the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history.\n",
      "More than 700 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 after faulty accounting software Horizon made it look as though money was missing from their shops.\n",
      "Many of those affected were financially ruined.\n",
      "As part of the role, advertised with a salary of up to Â£150,000, he had been tasked with leading the board of directors and working to right the wrongs of the Horizon dispute.\n",
      "Before that, he had worked on the board of companies ranging from ITV to WH Smith.\n",
      "A Post Office spokesperson said: \"On Saturday afternoon, the Post Office was informed that the business and trade secretary had asked Henry Staunton to stand down as chairman of the Post Office.\n",
      "\"We have been advised by the government that they will appoint an interim chairman shortly.\"\n",
      "They later said the Post Office was \"actively supportive of efforts to compensate postmasters fairly and quickly, and determined in its wish to help right the wrongs of the past\".\n",
      "\"As part of this process, in 2021 Post Office changed its governance structure, appointing two serving postmasters to the board, and is making progress on its commitment to replace the upgraded Horizon system with a new and appropriately funded modern solution,\" they said.\n",
      "\"While progress has been made with over Â£150m paid in compensation, there remains much work to do to ensure that full justice and compensation are delivered, and to make sure that this can never happen again.\"\n",
      "Also appearing on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour's shadow business secretary branded the government's decision to ask Mr Staunton to go \"quite unusual\".\n",
      "\"The government have to tell us why they made this decision seemingly yesterday\", Jonathan Reynolds said.\n",
      "\"The person who's going wasn't actually there for the scandal, so there must be specific reasons why they don't have confidence in that person going on.\"\n",
      "The Horizon scandal recently came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama. and public anger led to the former Post Office boss Paula Vennells handing back her CBE.\n",
      "Senior figures from the Post Office and the technology firm Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon software, are currently facing questions at a public inquiry over what happened.\n",
      "The Conservative peer James Arbuthnot, who has campaigned on behalf of sub-post masters, told the BBC he was surprised that Mr Staunton had left the role.\n",
      "He said the departure was an opportunity to change the culture and governance of the organisation.\n",
      "Some of his fellow campaigners have accused the Post Office leadership of being too slow to deliver compensation, and too quick to hand out bonuses to senior managers.\n",
      "Their hope is that the appointment of a new chairman will signal the start of more wide-ranging changes.\n",

      "Fiona Baker, from WNC, said there was a \"desperate need\" for the specialist education facility.\n",

      "Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter over the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\n",
      "Ms Hutchins was shot dead on the set of Rust, a forthcoming Western filmed near Santa Fe in New Mexico in October 2021.\n",
      "Mr Baldwin, 65, had been practising firing a pistol for a scene.\n",
      "Similar charges were dropped in April, just two weeks before he was due to go on trial, but New Mexico prosecutors say there is new forensic evidence.\n",
      "The actor entered the not guilty plea in a court filing on Wednesday, a day before a scheduled virtual court appearance in a Santa Fe court, which will now not take place.\n",
      "He was charged on 19 January in New Mexico after local prosecutors said \"additional facts\" had emerged from forensic tests on the weapon used in the shooting, in which director Joel Souza was also wounded.\n",
      "Mr Baldwin has maintained he did not pull the trigger of the Colt .45 pistol and only drew back its hammer.\n",
      "He has also argued he is not at fault for Ms Hutchins' death because he did not know the weapon contained live rounds and because no live ammunition was supposed to be on set.\n",
      "But special prosecutors in New Mexico said in October that they had commissioned forensic experts to reconstruct the weapon, after it had been broken during FBI testing.\n",
      "They said doing so had revealed that the incident could only have taken place if the trigger had been pulled.\n",
      "\"Although Alec Baldwin repeatedly denies pulling the trigger, given the tests, findings and observations reported here, the trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver,\" their report concluded.\n",
      "The actor - who has expressed \"shock and sadness\" at Ms Hutchins' death - said in recent court filings that he had struggled to find acting work since the incident.\n",
      "When prosecutors dropped involuntary manslaughter charges in April they warned that they could be refiled as investigations continued.\n",

      "We are months away from the Democratic and Republican conventions, the moment when each party officially unveils its presidential nominee.\n",
      "But the 2024 election seems all but set in stone.\n",
      "The contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be unique in modern history as a rematch between the current president and his immediate predecessor.\n",
      "\"Having two presidents running changes the nature of the race,\" says Todd Belt, a politics professor at George Washington University.\n",
      "\"This is a comparison, not just a referendum on the incumbent. There are no blank slates going into this election.\"\n",
      "The contrast will be simple, according to Sean Spicer, who served as Mr Trump's first press secretary and worked for the Republican National Committee prior to that.\n",
      "\"For those people who say, well, during Trump, the policies of Donald Trump made my life better, more secure, made the economy and our communities better, it's a no brainer.\"\n",
      "The Trump campaign has every motivation to go on the attack against Mr Biden, in part to distract from his own weaknesses - including his legal troubles, his divisive rhetoric and his attempts to undermine the 2020 election results, which contributed to the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol.\n",
      "But Mr Biden also has key vulnerabilities, struggling to sell his first-term achievements and trying to convince the public he has the energy for the campaign and a second term.\n",
      "Already in this presidential race he is painting his predecessor as out-of-control and a threat to America, and to democracy itself.\n",
      "\"Usually, that's what you do when you're running against somebody who's unknown in politics,\" says Susan Estrich, a Democratic author and analyst who managed Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign in 1988.\n",
      "\"But here, you've got somebody who's very well known, and you're just trying to prove he's a big risk.\"\n",
      "It's a rematch few Americans say they want - a bare-knuckle, nasty slog of a campaign - but it's a presidential choice that at this point they seem almost certain to get.\n",
      "Close race on a small map\n",
      "Mr Biden's approval ratings continue to languish in dangerous territory for an incumbent entering an election year. Public perceptions of Mr Trump are also negative, however.\n",
      "By all indications, November's general election is going to be tight. National polls show the two candidates either neck and neck or Mr Trump with a slight advantage.\n",
      "But this early in the race they are of limited usefulness, given the nature of the US political map. While Americans will head to the polls across the nation, this race will once again be decided in only a handful of states.\n",
      "That's because the electoral college, the system the US has to pick its president, depends on candidates winning each state and most states are solidly Democratic or Republican.\n",
      "The most crucial states that could go either way this year include Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan in the so-called Rust Belt, and Arizona and Georgia, two states that Mr Biden flipped Democratic in 2020.\n",
      "Nevada is also considered a toss-up but its small population makes it a less valuable prize.\n",
      "A few states that have been battlegrounds in previous election cycles have slipped off this map - Florida and North Carolina have trended Republican of late, while Virginia and Colorado appear to be more solidly Democratic.\n",
      "So while national polls provide fodder for political commentators, a much smaller subset of voters will ultimately be the ones who matter.\n",
      "Polling in November that showed Mr Trump inching ahead in these key states caused alarm among some Democrats, but polls a year from the election are not necessarily accurate predictors of the outcome.\n",
      "The economy (again)\n",
      "When it comes down to it, Americans tend to vote from their wallets in national elections - for the governing party in good times and the opposition in bad.\n",
      "\"It's the economy, stupid\" was the mantra of Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign, and the refrain has become political gospel in the decades since.\n",
      "One of the factors that makes 2024 challenging to predict is that, on the whole, economic indicators are positive.\n",
      "If you're in the UK, sign up here.\n",
      "And if you're anywhere else, sign up here.\n",
      "The economy is growing at a steady clip. Unemployment is near record lows. The stock market is hitting record highs. And yet American voters continue to have a grim view of their economic situation.\n",
      "Some of this can be attributed to several years of high inflation and the continuing high cost of housing in many parts of the US. Home sales in the US have sunk to the lowest levels in nearly 30 years.\n",

      "The 3ft-tall (0.9m) bronze is a tribute to the Windrush generation and represents the cultural and historical significance of the staple island food.\n",
      "The university said it was \"thrilled\" to acquire the piece to add to 25 others in a sculpture park in Coventry.\n",
      "Montserrat-born British sculptor Ryan won the Turner Prize in 2022 for her Windrush memorial , which consisted of giant sculptures of Caribbean fruits including Breadfruit.\n",
      "\"Representation and cultural visibility being evident in public spaces is crucial. I'm pleased Breadfruit will be at the University of Warwick,\" she said.\n",
      "The starchy foodstuff, whose pulp has a bread-like consistency when cooked, has been a staple in the Pacific Islands for centuries and wood from its tree is also used to make homes and boats.\n",
      "In the 18th Century, Captain William Bligh led a famous expedition on HMS Bounty to transport the plant from Tahiti to the Caribbean to provide a cheaper food source for slaves.\n",
      "Rebecca Earle, a food historian and a professor of history at the university, said breadfruit's continued popularity in Caribbean cuisine was down to \"the ingenuity of ordinary people\".\n",

      "Profits were $28.2bn (Â£22.3bn) in 2023, down from $39.9bn in 2022 which was the company's highest earnings in its 115-year history.\n",
      "Energy firms made record earnings when oil and gas prices soared in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine amid fears of supply problems.\n",
      "Households bills have eased since 2022, but remain at a high level.\n",
      "The price of gas and electricity, as well as petrol and diesel, first began to climb after the end of Covid lockdowns, but surged in March 2022 after the outbreak of war in Ukraine due to concerns over supplies.\n",
      "The price of Brent crude oil reached nearly $128 a barrel following the invasion, but has since fallen back and is currently at about $80. Gas prices also spiked but have come down from their highs.\n",
      "The 2022 surge in prices led to all energy companies, including the likes of Shell and BP, to make bumper profits. In response, the government introduced a windfall tax - called the Energy Profits Levy - on the \"extraordinary\" earnings of firms on their UK operations to help fund a scheme to subsidise gas and electricity bills.\n",
      "Shell confirmed it paid Â£178m in UK windfall tax for 2022. A company spokeswoman said the company paid Â£1.1bn in overall tax in the UK for 2023, of which Â£240m was taxed under the Energy Profits Levy.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Shell said it returned $23bn to its shareholders in 2023, and was now increasing its dividend by 4% and beginning a $3.5bn share buyback programme over the next three months.\n",
      "Shell said the fall in profit last year was a result of lower oil and gas prices, as well as lower volumes being traded and lower margins for refining, which is the process when crude oil, the raw material extracted from the earth, is made into products such as diesel.\n",
      "It added 2023 saw higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading. Many European countries turned to LNG as an alternative source of energy after Russia cut its supplies of natural gas to continent.\n",
      "As a result, the British company posted profits of $7.3bn in the final three months of 2023, which exceeded analysts' expectations but was down from a record $9.8bn in the same period the year before.\n",
      "Jamie Maddock, energy analyst at wealth management business Quilter Cheviot, said Shell's strong results were driven by its gas division.\n",
      "He warned that oil and gas prices were likely to remain \"unpredictable\" in 2024 with geopolitical tensions remaining high in the Middle East.\n",
      "\"It is these sorts of environments that energy giants can thrive in, as we saw in 2022, so it wouldn't be a shock to see Shell continuing to deliver over the course of the year,\" he added.\n",
      "Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner at Global Witness, accused Shell of \"choosing climate-wrecking U-turns and shareholder pay-outs\" as a result of its strong profits, rather than \"investing in clean energy\".\n",

      "Soon afterwards, he was asked to drop off parcels for a drugs gang in South London.\n",
      "\"I didn't know what it was,\" Sosa said. \"I used to see them in the park and just saw some people wanting to help me and I wanted to please them, so I did it.\n",
      "\"I had a bike and they just gave me the parcels to drop off and I picked up the cash. I was nine - I didn't ask questions, I just did the favour.\"\n",
      "Sosa was then sent to Margate on the Kent coast to hand out more parcels, unaware he was being used as a drugs mule for a county lines operation - where city gangs extend their activities into small towns across the country.\n",
      "\"I was there for three days,\" he said. \"Then on the third day, a gang of masked men burst through the door with shotguns and machetes and held a shotgun to my head. It was terrifying.\"\n",

      "\"I had no-one at the time, only them,\" he explained. \"So I stuck around. They looked after me, showed me stuff.\"\n",
      "They taught him how to deal drugs around the housing block where they operated - and gave the then 12-year-old a revolver.\n",

      "He spent years entrenched in gang life and still bears the brutal scars.\n",
      "\"I was stabbed at least 11 times,\" he said. \"I was shot at but never hit. I had this street name: The Devil That Walks On Earth.\"\n",
      "Sosa was eventually arrested at 14 and charged with possession of firearms and causing grievous bodily harm.\n",
      "He said the birth of his daughters - one during another stretch in prison for firearms offences before his 18th birthday - brought him back from the brink.\n",

      "A collection of remarkable and often hidden stories of Muslim women who helped shape the history of Britain have been revealed and documented in a new book.\n",
      "It covers the lives of women, from an aristocrat to a cafe owner and World War Two spy, and reinstates them as \"actors, storytellers and story makers,\" the authors said.\n",
      "\"Muslim women were key contributors not just to British Muslim history but to all of British history,\" said sociologist Prof Sariya Cheruvallil-Contractor, of Coventry University.\n",
      "\"If we are to understand who we are as a society we have got to understand all of our contributions,\" she added.\n",
      "She has worked with co-editor and historian Dr Jamie Gilham to curate stories from a range of contributors, often from \"very scarce source material,\" she said.\n",
      "\"These women came from communities that experienced precarious and difficult challenges - racism, prejudice towards their marriages and children, wars, financial insecurity, patriarchy and the problematic citizenship status of their husbands,\" she explained.\n",
      "\"Preserving their records and life histories was perhaps the last thing on their minds.\"\n",
      "The publication tells the stories of those who lived in Britain between the mid 19th and mid 20th Centuries, before immigration profoundly affected the size and composition of Britain's Muslim communities.\n",
      "In the book, Muslim Women in Britain, Prof Cheruvallil-Contractor writes about the life of Olive Salaman, helping shed light on the contribution of working class women.\n",
      "Olive was 15 years old when she moved from a small town in the Rhondda Valley to Cardiff to train as a nurse.\n",
      "One afternoon, trying to find her way home after a cinema trip, she stopped to ask a young Yemeni sailor for directions.\n",
      "\"We started talking and I think we fell in love there and then,\" she told a BBC documentary in 1968 .\n",
      "The man she had asked directions of was Ali Salaman, a young chef working in his own cafe in the Tiger Bay area of the city.\n",
      "After they married in 1937, she converted to Islam, lived through WW2, had 10 children of her own and fostered and adopted many more, becoming known as the \"mother of the Cardiff Yemenis\" and a legendary anchor of her community.\n",
      "The couple ran the area's popular Cairo Cafe, which became a hub for community life.\n",
      "Her story was an \"important one\", said the academic, who had gathered information using the BBC interview and oral history recordings.\n",
      "\"Mixed ethnicity marriages were not commonplace, they were frowned upon significantly in those times.\"\n",
      "Her social class had \"added another layer of invisibility, further cloaking these women's lives,\" she added.\n",
      "\"It was amazing when I started digging into these histories, I found not only were they alive and kicking and really active in their communities.\"\n",
      "Two of the first British mosques \"had women at the very centre of their establishment,\" she said.\n",
      "\"The one in Woking was funded by a woman and one in Liverpool a woman, Lady Fatima Cates, was its founding treasurer.\"\n",
      "One of the first known female converts to Islam in Britain, Cates's story was \"often cited\" in discussions about the early Liverpool Muslim community, \"yet very little has been written about her life,\" said contributor Hamid Mahmood.\n",
      "In the book he charts her life from a strict Christian household, her route to Islam at the the Abdullah Quilliam in Liverpool via the Temperance Movement, until her death in 1900.\n",
      "Her grave in the city's Anfield Cemetery lay unmarked until Mr Mahmood, who founded a madrassah school named after her in London, revealed it.\n",
      "\"Fatima's life and struggle against persecution, violence and Islamophobia more than a century ago is now being rediscovered by British Muslims,\" he writes.\n",
      "In 2022, a stone was finally placed on her unmarked grave, commemorating her life and significance.\n",
      "\"It's much harder to find resources about women and it was important to get their stories out,\" explained Prof Cheruvallil-Contractor.\n",
      "\"But if women were from the middle or upper middle classes there tended to be archival sources - their families hold material, their letters,\" she said.\n",
      "\"A case in point is Lady Evelyn Cobbold - her mother used to be lady in waiting to the Queen.\n",
      "\"We know a lot about her now, how she converts to Islam, a few years later performs the Hajj [pilgrimage to Mecca], writes a book about it. Now we know a lot about her but 15 years ago we knew nothing.\n",
      "\"Her family still has two big boxes full of letters, but a women like Olive Salaman - her family had existential crises, they didn't know on occasion where their next meal was going to come from, and so archives were the last thing on their mind.\"\n",
      "Dr Gilham, who has been researching the history of Islam for more than 20 years, tells the story of quite a different aristocratic Englishwoman Gladys Milton Brooke.\n",

      "A Japanese man has been sentenced to death for an arson attack at a Kyoto animation studio in 2019 which killed 36 people and injured dozens more.\n",
      "The incident, one of Japan's deadliest in recent decades, killed mostly young artists and shocked the anime world.\n",
      "Shinji Aoba, 45, pleaded guilty to the attack but his lawyers had sought a lighter sentence on grounds of \"mental incompetence\".\n",
      "Judges rejected this however, ruling that Aoba knew what he was doing.\n",
      "\"I have determined that the defendant was not mentally insane or weak at the time of the crime,\" Chief Judge Masuda said on Thursday at Kyoto District Court.\n",
      "\"The death of 36 people is extremely serious and tragic. The fear and pain of the deceased victims was indescribable,\" Japanese broadcaster NHK reported him saying.\n",
      "Many of the animation staff - young artists - were killed after being trapped on the upper floors of the studio as the fire spread.\n",
      "The attack was one of the deadliest cases in recent decades and sparked national mourning in Japan. The country's public and media have followed the case closely.\n",
      "Prosecutors had demanded the death penalty for Aoba, saying he was motivated to attack the studio after believing his work had been stolen. He said Kyoto Animation - known as KyoAni-  had plagiarised a novel he entered into their contest.\n",
      "In July 2019, he burst into the studio during a work day, splashing petrol on the ground floor and setting it alight while repeatedly shouting \"Drop dead\".\n",
      "He later said during his guilty plea in September 2023 that he did not think so many people would die.\n",
      "\"I felt I had no other option but to do what I did,\" he said at the time.\n",
      "\"I feel tremendously sorry and the feeling includes a sense of guilt.\"\n",
      "Aoba himself suffered burns to over 90% of his body in the fire, and was only arrested after he had recovered from operations.\n",
      "\"The delusion that KyoAni Studio had plagiarised his work influenced his motivation,\" prosecutors had told the court.\n",
      "But they said he was not controlled by such delusions and had full capacity and understanding of his actions.\n",
      "On Thursday, the judge read out a lengthy reasoning with victim testimonies before announcing the verdict. More than half of the animation studio's 70-strong workforce was killed in the event, and another 32 injured.\n",
      "\"Some of them saw their colleagues engulfed in flames, and some of them are suffering from psychological effects, and they are tormented by feelings of guilt and remorse,\" said Judge Masuda.\n",
      "Families of the victims were seen in the court room, with many visibly emotional as the judge read out the details of Aoba's crime, NHK reported.\n",
      "The outlet reported that Aoba kept his head bowed as the judge read out the death penalty sentence.\n",
      "Japan retains capital punishment for its most serious crimes, like multiple murders. Those convicted typically remain on death row for years, or even decades. The death penalty is conducted by hanging.\n",

      "The legislation will mean no routine checks on British goods being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland.\n",
      "Saturday marks two years to the day since the DUP collapsed the executive.\n",
      "The party's boycott was in protest over trade arrangements after Brexit.\n",
      "It had demanded changes to the way goods are traded between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in order for it to end its Stormont standoff.\n",
      "On Thursday evening, Speaker Alex Maskey wrote to all assembly members, summoning them to a sitting at 13:00 GMT on Saturday.\n",
      "Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris said he was delighted that the DUP have \"taken this next step to work with the other Northern Ireland parties to recall the assembly\".\n",
      "He added: \"I look forward to working with the new first minister, deputy first minister, and all the ministers in a returned Northern Ireland Executive, alongside Northern Ireland assembly members, to improve the lives of people living here.\"\n",
      "On Monday night, the DUP's 120-strong executive agreed to endorse a deal to return to Stormont pending the passage of legislation at Westminster.\n",
      "\"Following the completion of detailed internal party processes with my party officers, all our elected members and DUP peers in the Lords, as well as the government having taken the legislative steps required of it, we are now able to re-establish the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern Ireland Executive\", Sir Jeffrey said on Thursday.\n",
      "Speaking earlier during Thursday's debate in the House of Commons, Mr Chris Heaton-Harris said that when Stormont is up and running Northern Ireland politicians \"will be able to deliver strong government, make the right decisions for Northern Ireland and make Northern Ireland a much more prosperous place\".\n",
      "Of the deal agreed earlier this week, he said: \"Crucially, this legislation will also change the law so that new regulatory borders between Great Britain and Northern Ireland cannot emerge through future agreements with the European Union.\n",
      "\"This is an important new safeguard to futureproof Northern Ireland's constitutional status.\"\n",
      "Sir Jeffrey told the Commons that the NI Protocol \"undermined the principle of consent\" in the eyes of unionists, which he said was \"at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement\".\n",
      "He added: \"The new measures and legislation reset the balance so it is the principle of consent and the will of the people of Northern Ireland alone that will determine the future of our country as part of the United Kingdom.\"\n",
      "However,  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the command paper undermined the Good Friday Agreement and questioned whether the government had \"moved away from the principle of rigorous impartiality\".\n",
      "Later, Mr Eastwood said that Sir Jeffrey had \"done a lot of good work over the last couple of weeks\" and that he had been very brave as it was \"not an easy thing to face down people within your own constituency\".\n",
      "However, he said he wanted to put on record that the SDLP opposed the command paper as it undermined north-south co-operation and placed too much emphasis on east-west.\n",
      "'Grasp the opportunity'\n",
      "Later, debating the second part of the legislation, Steve Baker, minister of state for Northern Ireland, said the institutional arrangements for Stormont and the government's Â£3.3bn financial package represented a big opportunity for Northern Ireland.\n",
      "\"If Northern Ireland politicians reach out and grasp the opportunity before them - my goodness, they can make Northern Ireland a beacon before the world, a beacon of prosperity, I hope a beacon of reconciliation, and these regulations today are part of that process,\" he said.\n",
      "Asked by Mr Eastwood if he supported the part of the Good Friday Agreement which demands the UK government remain \"rigorously impartial\" Mr Baker said he \"absolutely\" does.\n",
      "He said that the agreement reached with the DUP was compatible \"both with our unionism and with our full respect of all dimensions of the Belfast Agreement\".\n",
      "Shadow Secretary of State Hilary Benn said: \"Once we've done our bit today, it will be over to the politicians of Northern Ireland.\"\n",
      "Criticism within party\n",
      "However, DUP MP Sammy Wilson told the Commons that he does not support the deal.\n",
      "He said it was important to examine the detail and he did not think the way the legislation had been \"hurried through\" allowed for such examination.\n",
      "DUP peer Lord Dodds  welcomed the creation of new bodies under the new agreement such as InterTrade UK and the East-West Council, adding: \"I commend and congratulate all those who have been involved in the talks.\"\n",
      "But he said there were \"many, many unionists who are deeply worried and concerned that the Irish Sea Border - and we must drill down into the details of this deal - that the Irish Se\n",

      "Mr Swinney served as deputy first minister and education secretary until May 2021. Following a reshuffle, he left the latter role to become Covid recovery secretary.\n",
      "He stepped down from government in March 2023.\n",
      "The inquiry had already heard that none of his WhatsApps or \"similar messages\" had been retained.\n",
      "A document supplied to the inquiry stated the texts had been either deleted manually or by using an auto-delete function.\n",
      "The former deputy first minister told the inquiry he rarely spoke to Ms Sturgeon via text messages or other informal means.\n",
      "He said texts were generally only used to set up a phone call.\n",
      "Mr Swinney told the inquiry that since entering government in 2007 he had \"deleted material after I have made sure any relevant information was placed on the official record of the government, and that was the approach I was advised to take\".\n",
      "He said this approach was never \"questioned\" in previous years in government and was \"consistent\" with the ministerial code.\n",
      "The former deputy first minister conceded that it \"might well be the case\" that all the information needed by the inquiry might not be retained.\n",
      "He said he would apologise \"unreservedly\" if he had \"misunderstood\" the government's records management policy.\n",
      "\"My intention was never to do anything other than ensure the official record was furnished with all of the information that it needed to have,\" Mr Swinney said.\n",
      "The inquiry was sent 18 pages of WhatsApp messages between Mr Swinney and current First Minister Humza Yousaf from during the pandemic.\n",
      "They were recovered from an old handset of Mr Yousaf's after Mr Swinney erased his messages, the inquiry heard.\n",
      "\"They would be deleted by periodic deletion once I was satisfied I had told my private office any info that was relevant so that I was not facing a large number of messages that I would potentially have to delete on one occasion,\" Mr Swinney added.\n",
      "The inquiry was also shown messages from 14 December 2021, following cabinet talks, between then health secretary Mr Yousaf and national clinical director Jason Leitch.\n",
      "At the meeting, Mr Yousaf had suggested unexpectedly that he may be able to make Â£100m from the health budget available for business support as the government considered another lockdown.\n",
      "In the messages, Mr Yousaf told Mr Leitch that Ms Sturgeon had been \"ranting\" at him and he had taken \"one hell of a bullet\".\n",
      "Mr Leitch said Ms Sturgeon was being \"ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous\" and that he \"almost intervened\".\n",
      "Counsel to the inquiry, Jamie Dawson KC, put it to Mr Swinney that the culture of the Scottish cabinet was driven by Ms Sturgeon's \"strong mindedness when challenging her was seen as taking a bullet\".\n",
      "Mr Swinney said: \"No, because I think that particular morning, the first minister was a little bit surprised that the health portfolio had been able to find Â£100m to transfer to business support.\n",
      "\"In all my 10 years of handling the public finances of Scotland, the health secretary never offered me Â£100m in exchange for anything.\"\n",
      "He insisted the cabinet had \"open and full discussions\".\n",
      "Ms Forbes, in messages about the same cabinet meeting, said she had \"never seen the FM this angry in all my cabinets for good reason\".\n",
      "She told the inquiry that while \"surprises\" were not typically welcome at cabinet, Mr Yousaf had tried to be \"helpful\" and had not tried to \"undermine the process\".\n",
      "School closures\n",
      "Mr Swinney told the inquiry that the decision to close schools in March 2020 was made during a conversation between him and Ms Sturgeon, not in a discussion involving the full cabinet.\n",
      "The former deputy first minister said this was because \"events were moving at an absolutely ferocious pace\".\n",
      "He added the Scottish government \"did not have the time or the opportunity\" to complete an equality impact assessment on children's learning and development if schools were closed.\n",
      "Earlier, the inquiry heard that the Scottish government's equivalent of Cobra meetings - the Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR) - had not been minuted.\n",
      "Neither were records kept for so-called \"gold command\" meetings - attended by Ms Sturgeon, a small group of advisers and a revolving group of ministers.\n",

      "Mr Guterres's statement followed a strongly-worded reaction by the head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, who called the decision to suspend funds \"shocking\" given the small number of staff facing the Israeli allegations.\n",
      "He made it clear that UNRWA shared the list of its staff with Israel every year and had never received any concerns.\n",
      "Some countries have said they will continue their support for UNRWA. Norway's representative to the Palestinian Authority said the organisation has a \"crucial role\" in distributing aid, and emphasised the \"need to distinguish between what individuals may have done, and what UNRWA stands for\".\n",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz urged Mr Lazzarini to resign and said he aimed to stop UNRWA operating in Gaza after the war.\n",
      "The 7 October attacks triggered Israel's massive retaliation on Hamas in Gaza - air strikes and shelling that have killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n",
      "UNRWA says it is struggling to get humanitarian aid to many of the estimated 1.7 million people - nearly three-quarters of the population - displaced by 12 weeks of fighting.\n",
      "Most recently, the fighting has centred on Khan Younis, where thousands of Palestinians displaced from the north had congregated.\n",
      "Many are now said to be moving further south, towards Rafah on the border with Egypt.\n",
      "Most of northern Gaza has been reduced to ruins as Israel pursues its campaign with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas.\n",
      "Israel says it is destroying a network of tunnels - with estimates that 20-40% had been made unusable so far, according to US and Israeli officials quoted by US newspaper Wall Street Journal.\n",

      "The British Museum will put 10 items stolen from its collection on show later this month.\n",
      "The Roman gems, to be featured in an exhibition Rediscovering Gems, include a cameo with a bust of Cupid from the 1st or 2nd Century AD.\n",
      "In August, the museum announced up to 2,000 objects from its storerooms were missing, stolen or damaged.\n",
      "It has recovered about 350 items to date.\n",
      "The exhibition will explore the significance of classical gems through history.\n",
      "George Osborne, who chairs the museum's Board of Trustees, said the new display was an example of openness and \"culture change\" at the British Museum.\n",
      "\"We promised we'd show the world the gems that were stolen and recovered - rather than hide them away,\" he added.\n",
      "The museum has released pictures of two of those gems that have been chosen for display.\n",
      "Both were returned by Dr Ittai Gradel, the dealer and collector who alerted the British museum to the thefts, and was originally brushed off.\n",
      "Dr Gradel told the BBC he had been \"delighted\" to work with the museum on the recovery process.\n",
      "\"I am greatly pleased also to see that the whole culture of the institution appears to be changing to one of much greater openness and willingness to confront problems, than what I encountered in 2021,\" he said.\n",
      "Dr Gradel has played a major role in the recovery process, tracking down and returning hundreds of gems he had bought in good faith.\n",
      "Gems he has returned and will now go on display include an intaglio made from black glass with a bust of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom.\n",
      "The new exhibition will also show more than 500 objects that were not caught up in the thefts. All the previously stolen items will be in their own display case and clearly labelled.\n",
      "I've seen many of the recovered gems during our investigation of the story for BBC News.\n",
      "They are made of stone or glass, variously coloured and tiny - often barely the size of a thumbnail.\n",
      "They are a fascinating window into the ancient Mediterranean world, where they were worn as jewellery, used as seals and collected as objects of beauty in their own right.\n",
      "They are engraved or cast, perhaps with the face of an Emperor, a Roman or Greek God or another depiction from a classical story.\n",
      "Tom Harrison, keeper of the department of Greece and Rome, says the exhibition is \"an interesting opportunity to cast some light on an underappreciated and very beautiful art form\".\n",
      "These types of gems were hugely popular in the 18th Century. But they fell out of favour.\n",
      "That may be one explanation for why they were left, unregistered, in the British Museum storeroom for more than a century.\n",
      "Dr Gradel said gems had been \"overlooked\" but provided \"beautiful and fascinating insights into the tastes and mindsets of the ancient Greeks and Romans\".\n",
      "\"They are indeed deserving of far more study than they have received,\" he told the BBC. \"I look greatly forward to visiting the exhibition\".\n",
      "After an investigation discovered items had been stolen, a senior curator in the Greece and Rome department, Peter Higgs, was dismissed. He has previously denied any wrongdoing.\n",
      "The police investigation is ongoing.\n",
      "Following the controversy, German art historian and British Museum director Hartwig Fischer resigned and former Victoria and Albert (V&A) Museum director Sir Mark Jones was appointed in the interim.\n",
      "Rediscovering gems will be on display for free in room three at the British Museum from 15 February - 15 June 2024.\n",

      "The chief executive of High Street fashion chain H&M has quit after four years in the role as the firm revealed a slowdown in sales last year including over the Christmas season.\n",
      "Daniel Erver, who has worked for the Swedish chain for 18 years, will step in to Helena Helmersson's role.\n",
      "The company's annual profits to November were also below market expectations.\n",
      "Analysts say the group is lagging behind rivals Zara and Shein.\n",
      "Shares in H&M dropped 10% following the announcement.\n",
      "Ms Helmersson said the role had been \"very demanding at times\", and that she had \"mixed feelings\" about her departure.\n",
      "\"I am very proud of what we together have achieved during the last years when we have navigated through pandemic, and several geopolitical and macro-economic challenges,\" she said.\n",
      "The Swedish firm has 3,874 stores in 77 countries, and is well-known for mid-value fashion, including accessories and sportswear. Some of its stores recently introduced homeware.\n",
      "It has been a stalwart of UK High Streets since 1976, but it has faced fierce competition in recent years  by online fashion firms that turn styles around more quickly and at lower prices.\n",
      "H&M, like the rest of the fashion retail market, is facing a squeeze, said analyst Catherine Shuttleworth, with shoppers spending less on items that are seen as discretionary as they grapple with the cost-of-living crisis.\n",
      "Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - reached near-record highs in 2023, but is slowing.\n",
      "\"For brands like H&M they find themselves fighting off competition at one end from major players like Inditex brands such as Zara, Pull and Bear and BERSHKA, as well as established retailers like Next, Primark and M&S and at the other end from fast growing online players - most notably, Shein,\" Ms Shuttleworth said.\n",
      "Chinese-owned Shein's sales have been on a steep trajectory, after online sales surged during the pandemic. It is expanding in the British market in particular after its recent acquisition of British online retailer Missguided.\n",
      "Running a business like this was \"no easy gig\" in the current climate Ms Shuttleworth said, given \"concerns around global uncertainty, shipping issues and the volatile nature of consumer spending\".\n",
      "One concern on the horizon is disruption to supply chains, after Houthi rebels began attacking passing ships in one of the world's most popular trading route in the Red Sea.H&M revealed a pre-tax profit of 8.7 billion Swedish Krona (Â£660m) for the year to November, below analysts' expectations. It said sales in the two months to January were 4% lower compared with last year.\n",
      "In September, it admitted it needed to do more to improve consistency in clothes sizing, after it faced a backlash over its returns fee for online items. Earlier this year, it dropped and apologised for an advert in Australia about school uniforms, after it was accused of sexualising young children.\n",
      "H&M said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the offence caused by the advert and said it would \"look into how we present campaigns going forward\".\n",

      "The gap in our knowledge of great white sharks may have just been narrowed thanks to a YouTuber.\n",
      "As far as experts are aware, the birth of a great white shark has never been witnessed, but Carlos Gauna may have captured the closest thing to that.\n",
      "Carlos has found fame on YouTube as TheMalibuArtist and has filmed incredible shots of sharks from above with his drone.\n",
      "\"You're basically viewing the sharks through a magnifying glass that they don't know is watching them,\" he says.\n",
      "His YouTube videos, which have racked up tens of millions of views, often show great whites swimming concerningly close to humans.\n",
      "\"It does raise my heart rate sometimes. I've yet to see a shark get aggressive with or show aggressive behaviour around a human, but [it's] just human instinct,\" he says.\n",
      "On a beach near Santa Barbara, California, last year, a sighting of a different nature got Carlos's pulse going.\n",
      "He had already seen large sharks in the area when he stumbled across something he had never seen before.\n",
      "\"This little bitty white, almost albino-looking, white shark came up to the surface,\" he says.\n",
      "As Carlos brought down his drone closer, more details of the shark emerged. It was white all over, but the white layer seemed to be flaking off.\n",
      "At the time, Carlos was with shark researcher Phil Sternes, from the University of California, Riverside, who could not believe what he was seeing.\n",
      "\"I'm like, 'oh my goodness, this could be a newborn',\" he says.\n",
      "\"We're both falling out of our seats with excitement at that point. It was quite a moment.\"\n",
      "What got Phil particularly excited was the shape of the shark, whose fins were more rounded than usual. That is something you see in shark embryos and newborns.\n",
      "He says the white layer could have been evidence the shark had just been born and still had a mucus-like substance on its body.\n",
      "James Worthington, from the University of San Diego, helped the pair size the shark. Using the drone's distance from the sea surface and the crop factor, he worked out it was roughly 1.5m (4.9ft) long - about the right size for a newborn.\n",
      "Their observation has been published in the journal Environmental Biology of Fishes.\n",
      "However, some marine biologists urge caution at jumping to the conclusion that it is definitely a newborn great white shark.\n",
      "Dr Chris Lowe, from California State University's shark lab believes the finding is interesting, but there are other explanations for the white layer.\n",
      "\"Sure, this could be a newborn shark, or it could be a shark with a skin disease, or it could be a number of other things we haven't even thought of,\" he says.\n",
      "\"Unfortunately, it's a sample size of one. I think many scientists would agree that in order for us to consider this area of pupping location, we would need a lot more evidence.\"\n",
      "In their report, Phil and Carlos acknowledge that the shark could have a skin condition, but Phil says: \"What's unique about this shark is it has a white layer.\n",
      "\"I looked in the literature extensively, we couldn't find anything that matches up to this. So it could be an unknown skin condition that's never been documented before, which is also unique.\"\n",
      "However, they believe that theory ignores other evidence from Carlos's video  - the aggressiveness of the flaking, the shape of the fins and the size of the shark.\n",
      "Drones have ushered in a revolution in shark filming, and not just for citizen scientists like Carlos. They are used by shark scientists to analyse the fish's behaviour, with some amazing observations.\n",
      "\"We just completed a two-year study where one of my grad students went out and flew drone surveys at 26 California beaches every month for two years,\" Dr Lowe says.\n",
      "\"What they found was that aggregation sites where we have juvenile white sharks day in day out, there were interactions with people every single day - multiple interactions.\"\n",
      "That is exactly what Carlos finds. Great whites are much more common along California's beaches than you might think, and it is not uncommon for them to get close to humans.\n",
      "Armed with a drone and patience, he is hoping to one day become the first person to film one being born.\n",

      "They've called on them to put the constitution before \"party loyalty\".\n",
      "It feels like a last throw of the dice to block the DUP's path back to power-sharing.\n",
      "If it works, Sir Jeffrey's leadership will hang in the balance.\n",
      "If it fails, the DUP leader will feel turbocharged and will face down his critics both internally and externally with more fire.\n",
      "DUP officers are not due to meet on Monday, but that may come when and if the government responds to any fresh demands.\n",
      "That could be the final move when it comes.\n",
