    "A lawyer for Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in prison earlier this month, has been briefly detained in Moscow.\nRussian media said Vasily Dubkov was held for \"violating public order\".\nRussian officials have not confirmed that he was arrested nor the reason why. But Mr Dubkov told news outlet Verstka he was freed later on Tuesday.\nMr Dubkov accompanied Navalny's mother to the Arctic prison colony where he died on 16 February.\nIn October 2023, other lawyers for Navalny - Vadim Kobzev, Igor Sergunin, and Aleksei Lipster - were arrested on charges of \"extremism\".\nIn January, Olga Mikhailova, another lawyer for the opposition leader, said she had been charged with the same crime and decided to remain in exile.\nRussian authorities banned the Anti-Corruption Foundation, the organisation led by Navalny, for \"extremism\" in 2021.\nThe opposition leader's body was held by prison authorities for more than a week following his death. His mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, travelled to the remote \"Polar Wolf\" jail where he died to retrieve his body, accompanied by Mr Dubkov.\nThe body was handed over to his mother eight days after his death. Mrs Navalnaya said she was threatened by authorities, who wanted her son to be buried in \"secret\".\nNavalny's allies have said they are looking for a place to hold a public memorial for the former opposition leader.\nHowever, Navalny's press secretary, Kira Yarmysh, said on Tuesday that most funeral locations they had contacted had refused to allow a ceremony on their premises.\n\"Some places say that the premises are occupied, some refuse when the name Navalny is mentioned. In one place we were directly told that funeral agencies were prohibited from working with us,\" Ms Yarmysh wrote.",
    "Expert divers from a private company will join the search for a missing two-year-old boy after he fell into a river in Leicester, police said.\nXielo Maruziva fell into the River Soar, in the Aylestone area, at about 17:00 GMT on 18 February.\nA police search to find him, involving specialist teams, is now in its second week.\nThe search area has been widened and a private diving company is providing police with support from Tuesday.\nIn an updated statement on Monday, Leicestershire Police said Specialist Group International (SGI) is involved after \"liaison with Xielo's family and having spoken to both the company and independent specialists\".\nThe same company assisted Lancashire Police when Nicola Bulley vanished on a riverside dog walk in St Michael's on Wyre on 27 January last year.\nNow Leicestershire Police is using the company's expertise after consultation with search specialists and Xielo's family.\nAssistant Chief Constable Michaela Kerr said: \"We continue to be grateful to the support we've been shown by the public and colleagues from other forces and agencies.\n\"We're in regular contact with Xielo's family and are continuing to support them in what remains a very upsetting time.\n\"Our search operation to locate Xielo continues to widen - as we know he may have travelled further from where he went into the water - and potentially outside our force area.\n\"I would like to reassure you that our operation is continuing and our teams will be carrying out co-ordinated searches at various points along the river.

    "A date for the demolition of some of the UK's last cooling towers has prompted a plea about their future.\nWest Burton and Cottam coal-fired power stations dominated north Nottinghamshire's landscape for more than 60 years but closed in 2023 and 2019 respectively.\nIt has now been confirmed West Burton is due to be cleared by 2028.\nCampaign group the Twentieth Century Society (TCS) said such \"engineering marvels\" should be preserved.\nBuilt in the early 1960s, the 14 power stations of the River Trent's \"Megawatt Alley\" once produced about a quarter of the UK's energy needs.\nNow the drive for cheaper, cleaner and more environmentally-sustainable power has led to only one still operating - at Ratcliffe upon Soar - which itself is due to shut in September.\nDemolition of West Burton A - a gas-fired B station shares the site - began earlier this month with low-rise buildings known as Precipitators 3&4 being levelled, and the boiler house of Cottam went on Thursday .\nThe cooling towers at Cottam are due to be demolished next year.\nBut TCS, an architectural campaign group which calls for the preservation of significant modern buildings, said the beginning of demolition was a \"sad milestone\".\nOli Marshall, head of campaigns, said: \"We're in danger of wiping out an entire chapter of our industrial heritage.\n\"The cooling towers of our post-war power stations are silent sculptural giants; they're an engineering marvel unlike any other man-made structure. The Stonehenge or Avebury of the carbon age.\"\nThe group said while they are large enough to fit the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, parts of the concrete shell were only six inches (15cm) thick.\nIt pointed out that in Germany and South Africa, redundant towers are being repurposed as the centrepiece of extreme sports and amusement parks.\nMr Marshall added: \"The British landscape is dotted with the remnants of power and industry from previous centuries - from smock windmills and gasholders, to mill chimney stacks and bottle kilns.\n\"Long after the sails have stopped turning and the furnaces have been extinguished, these functional structures have gradually assumed the status of regional and national landmarks.\n\"The cooling towers of our post-war power stations are simply the latest example.\n\"At their peak in the 1960s, there were as many as 250 individual towers, now less than 50 remain.\n\"With five to 10 being demolished every year, they exist on borrowed time.\"\nTCS tried to get the West Burton towers listed but instead a Certificate Of Immunity (COI) was issued, effectively blocking any attempt at preservation.\nA Historic England spokesperson said: \"The Certificate Of Immunity (COI) from listing was granted to West Burton Power Station in 2017, and renewed in 2022.\n\"We are aware of the plans for the closure of the last post-war coal-fired power stations, and in response we have implemented a detailed recording programme, and are working with the Science Museum Group to ensure the selective retention of artefacts.\n\"This will ensure valuable information and evidence relating to this industry is available for posterity and study by current and future generations.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

Leaders need to address this urgently and put in place mitigations to keep people safe while they are waiting to be seen.\"\nDue to the lack of space, people were being treated in corridors and reception staff were also expected to help people to get to the minor injuries waiting area without proper training, he said.\n\"However, some of the challenges with space were due to a lack of beds in the community, which meant there was poor flow through the hospital departments,\" Mr Howarth continued.\nBut staff were \"working hard to care compassionately\" for people in a challenging environment and were committed to improving services.\nLast month, the inspection was discussed at a regional meeting of hospital bosses , with the trust's managing director Jane Ives saying \"a congested ED is not a safe ED\".\n'Improved child-specific training'\nBosses then reported that staffing levels had been boosted but noted the trust was currently heavily reliant on expensive agency and temporary staff.\nIn response to the report, Ms Ives said the trust had been working to reduce the length of time that medically-fit patients have to wait for support at home ahead of discharge.\nThe trust was also looking at the flow of patients through the hospital to understand where further improvements can be made.\nThe limited size of the department and the increasing number of patients were causing congestion, but plans were in place for the creation of virtual wards, allowing patients to be cared for at home.\nThe trust was pleased the CQC found progress in a number of areas, including improved child-specific training for staff, upgrades to the children's area, and an increase in the number of staff.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Donald Trump must post a bond to cover the full $454m penalty while he appeals against the judgment in his New York civil fraud trial, a court has ruled.\nMr Trump's lawyers had argued he would \"suffer irreparable harm\" if forced to pay the entire sum and that he was prepared to post a $100m (\u00c2\u00a379m) bond.\nThe judge did pause a three-year ban on him seeking loans from New York banks - which could help him secure the bond.\nNew York's attorney general has vowed to seize his assets if he doesn't pay.\nMr Trump's lawyers have not immediately responded to the appeals court's ruling.\nThe order issued on Wednesday requires Mr Trump to pay the full amount, which stems from his misrepresenting of his property values, in the coming weeks.\nIn a filing on Wednesday, Mr Trump's lawyers said the \"exorbitant and punitive amount of the judgment coupled with an unlawful and unconstitutional blanket prohibition on lending transactions would make it impossible to secure and post a complete bond\".\nThey also said a $100m bond coupled with Trump's \"vast\" real estate properties and oversight by a court-designated monitor for the Trump Organization, should be sufficient to secure the full sum.\nBut their motion, which was opposed by Attorney General Letitia James, failed to convince appeals court Associate Justice Anil Singh.\nBut Judge Singh did agree to pause part of the judgement that prohibits Mr Trump and his sons from conducting business in the state, effectively leaving them at the head of the Trump Organization.\nThe penalty will keep accruing interest by at least $112,000 per day if he refuses to pay.\nMs James had asked the appeals court to deny Mr Trump's request.\n\"There is no merit to defendants' contention that a full bond or deposit is unnecessary because they are willing to post a partial undertaking of less than a quarter of the judgment amount,\" the attorney general's office said in a filing.\n\"Defendants all but concede that Mr Trump has insufficient liquid assets to satisfy the judgment: defendants would need 'to raise capital' to do so. These are precisely the circumstances for which a full bond or deposit is necessary.\"\nLast week, Ms James told ABC News: \"If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek judgment enforcement mechanisms in court, and we will ask the judge to seize his assets.\"\nAccording to a Forbes estimate, Mr Trump is worth about $2.6bn.

    "Scientists say they now have a better idea of exactly where and when the margin of Antarctica started melting.\nThey've traced the changing shapes of bumps on the ice surface that mark locations where glaciers are anchored in place.\nHalf a century ago, few of these frozen moorings, or \"pinning points\", showed much change.\nSince 2000, however, more than a third have reduced in size, emphasising the acceleration in melting.\nThe research is published in the journal Nature and underscores once again the increasing contribution that ice losses from the continent will make to future sea-level rise around the globe.\nThe study's focus was the ice shelves that fringe 75% per cent of Antarctica's coastline.\nThe shelves are the floating fronts of glaciers that have pushed out into the surrounding ocean.\nMany of them - especially in the west of the continent - are being assaulted by warm water and are thinning as a consequence.\nThat's bad news because they are regarded as a key braking mechanism, slowing the movement of ice off the continent.\nIn places where the seafloor is shallow - where there's an underwater hill, for example - the shelves can get caught in place, holding back the glacier ice to their rear.\nThe pinning points are reasonably obvious to a passing satellite because they produce a lump at the shelf surface where the flowing ice has had to ride over them.\nWhat the Edinburgh University team did was analyse through time how these bumps had changed shape.\nThe idea was to see if the bumps got smaller, which would imply the shelves were thinning - that they were melting; that their braking force was getting weaker.\nDr Bertie Miles went back through the entire image archive from the long-running American Landsat spacecraft series to assemble new, cloudless mosaics of Antarctica's coastline.\nHe then analysed what happened at the ice surface during three periods: from 1973 to 1989, 1990 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2022.\nIn the initial period, only 15% of pinning points reduced in size. This then picked up in the 1990s, when 25% experienced shrinkage. And then, in the final period, 37% of pinning point bumps were seen to get smaller.\n\"As we go through the decadal snapshots, you see these bumps in general getting smaller and sometimes completely disappearing,\" Dr Miles said.\n\"The thing to remember is that once an ice shelf loses contact with a pinning point, it's very difficult to regain contact, because you get a dynamical response in the ice: it starts to speed up and the grounding line - the line where the glacier is still touching the seabed - starts to retreat,\" he told BBC News.\nWhat's interesting about this study is that it's used a different approach from how the thinning of ice shelves is normally assessed.\nThis is done using a specific type of satellite called an altimeter, which sends down radar pulses to very precisely measure the height of the ice surface.\nBut this gold standard technique only goes back 30 years to the early 90s.\nBy using the proxy of the ice bumps in the Landsat images, the record of thinning observations can be pushed back a further two decades.\nThis deeper history gave us a much better grasp of where and when ice loss really got going, said Edinburgh co-worker Prof Rob Bingham.\n\"The Landsat record shows you, for example, that those well known, big glaciers in West Antarctica -  Pine Island and Thwaites - were quite unusual in that there was change happening on them already in the 1970s,\" he explained.\n\"But in a lot of other places, and certainly in their sector around the Amundsen Sea where the thinning is completely pervasive now - you didn't see that happening until the 1990s.\"\nProf Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego observes ice shelves with satellite altimeters.

    "The Daily Telegraph , the Times and Financial Times all report on their front pages that the Chancellor is considering scrapping or reducing the tax breaks for non-doms.\nThe rules allow some wealthy individuals, whose main home is overseas, not to pay tax on foreign earnings. According to the FT, the idea is on a \"secret project list\" of potential revenue-raising measures. On its website, the Guardian notes it would be \"poaching\" one of Labour's key fiscal policies, making it an option the Times describes as \"particularly contentious\" or as the FT calls it - \"politically charged.\"\nThe Daily Mail suggests creating a \"huge problem\" for Labour would be an \"added benefit\" for the Conservatives, but stresses it may not be announced in the Budget, if it's not deemed necessary. Analysis in the Telegraph suggests axing the status is no \"silver bullet\" as it may drive some non-doms out of the UK, while others could use offshore trusts.\nThe i predicts that Jeremy Hunt's Budget is unlikely to fix what he's admitted is the \"unfairness\" of the child benefit system.

The Sun protests that guards shouldn't be needed for politicians. Instead it urges police chiefs to be willing to send in the cops and enforce the law. The Times backs Rishi Sunak's calls - saying \"this assault on our national life cannot continue.\"\nIn its editorial, the Daily Express urges parliament not to \"shy away\" from debating assisted dying. It welcomes a Commons committee report, saying it offers a \"valuable contribution\" but doesn't go far enough.\nThe Guardian's front page says the world's largest review of ultra-processed food has directly linked it to 32 health risks. According to the Times , the research involving nearly 10 million people indicates that these foods are associated with a 55% greater risk of dying young. They're also linked to heart disease, cancer and mental health disorders. The review's authors suggest the findings provide a rationale to develop public health measures to reduce exposure to foods such as fizzy drinks, ready meals and sugary cereals. The Mail highlights the review's limitations - as people who consume lots of fast foods tend also to have unhealthy lifestyles.\nBoth the Daily Mirror and Daily Star report on a claim that the serial killer, Fred West, had access to a network of tunnels near his home that he could have used to carry out and cover up his crimes.

Eventually, the capsule passes naturally out of the body within the stool.\nThe spokesperson said swallowing a capsule would be far less invasive and painful that a traditional colonoscopy.\nThey said a colonoscopy takes place in a hospital using a telescope to provide images of the large bowel and could be \"embarrassing and uncomfortable\".\nIt was hoped the technology would mean patients could swallow the capsule in a GP surgery or the comfort of their own homes, they added.\nProf Turvill, consultant gastroenterologist with the trust, said 50 trusts around the UK would be involved in the research which, if successful, could \"rapidly increase the capacity for diagnosing bowel cancer and other bowel diseases and so reduce waiting times\".\nSimon Morritt, the trust's chief executive, added: \"The colon capsule endoscopy has a great deal of potential and we are excited and privileged to be leading its national evaluation.\n\"If successful, the potential benefit to patients cannot be underestimated.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

Luxury cars fly over the city's markets, supervillains are armed with bionic arms and AI pets are a must-have item.\nThe six-part series features Nigerian Pidgin - a mix of English and local languages - and all characters are voiced by actors from the West African country.\nAfter the series was launched on Wednesday, UK newspaper the Guardian gave it a four-star rating, calling it a \"delightful coming-of-age adventure\" that is \"an encouraging step into a bold and brilliant future\".\nHowever, the review also notes that Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba was \"frantically paced and hard to follow\".\nUS entertainment site Screengrab also criticised the show's pacing, as well as its character development.\nBut \"top-notch animation\" distracts from these issues, it says.\nScreengrab awarded Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba three-and-a-half stars, saying: \"The exploration of economic inequality through its characters is multifaceted.\n\"Not everyone is able to utilize the same amount of technology, something touched upon by the show's story.\"\nDespite Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba receiving largely positive reviews from critics, several Nigerians have complained on social media that although the show focuses on Nigeria, they cannot watch it as Disney+ is not available in their country.\n\"Disney really isn't serious though. Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba's dropping in like five days and Disney+ still isn't available to us,\" a user on social media platform X wrote prior to the show's release.\nAfter initially announcing that Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba would stream exclusively on Disney+, the company said Nigerians who subscribe to DSTV would be able to watch the show on the Disney Channel, where it will air in late April and early May, Nigerian media reports say.\nIn other reviews, ABC News in Australia says: \"Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba is both uniquely African, and yet universal in its appeal... every intricate detail has been thought of.\" Elsewhere, US news website Mashable says the \"gorgeous\" show \"dreams up some seriously covetable gadgets\".\nFollowing Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba's release, social media users that could access the show were also largely positive, calling it \"an instant classic\" and \"authentic\".\nNigeria's culture minster is among Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba's fans. At the show's premiere in Lagos, Hannatu Musawa said: \"This is huge for Nigeria because at last we now have our own stories being told from our own perspective.\"\nDisney first approached London-based Kugali to collaborate after the start-up was interviewed by BBC News in 2019.\nIn the video, Kugali co-founder Hamid Ibrahim, vowed to defeat Disney in the African market.\nLast week, in a short documentary about the making of Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba, Mr Ibrahim recounted that first interaction with Disney .\n\"You just called them out,\" he says. \"Then someone reaches out saying: 'Hi' - that they're from Disney - 'want to talk?'\"\nMr Ibrahim says he hopes the project will spark meaningful change.\n\"I hope Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba launches the next generation of artists,\" he says in the Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba documentary. \"I hope it's a point of inspiration for artists all over the world.\"\nIn its review of Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba, the Guardian notes that Iw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba taps into Afrofuturism , a movement that uses science-fiction and technology to imagine a future which centres on black communities - think Marvel's Black Panther and Janelle Monae's Grammy-nominated album Dirty Computer.\nIw\u00c3\u00a1j\u00c3\u00ba, which actually means future in the Yoruba language, is \"specific in it's Afrofuturism\" by presenting a \"solid sense of the Nigerian identity\", according to the review.\nBut that doesn't mean viewers outside Nigeria won't be able to relate to the story.\nThe review assures: \"Even if you don't know your suya [grilled meat] from your puff-puffs [donuts], there are plenty of universal themes - self-identity, family, independence - to grab on to.\"\nYou may be interested in:",

    "Some of the UK's biggest housebuilders are being investigated over whether they have been sharing information which could influence house prices.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority has launched the probe after a year-long investigation into housebuilding in England, Wales and Scotland.\nIt also said \"significant intervention\" in the market was needed to ensure enough homes were built to meet demand.\nThe watchdog also raised concerns over the quality of new homes.\nThe CMA said that its investigation had uncovered evidence suggesting \"information sharing\", which \"could be influencing the build-out of sites and the prices of new homes\".\nCMA chief executive Sarah Cardell told the BBC: \"Through our investigation we've seen evidence of potential exchanges of confidential, commercially sensitive information relating to sales prices and sale rates between some of the UK's major housebuilders.\n\"Now we don't believe that that's a key driver of the fundamental poor outcomes in this market, but it is clearly critically important that all companies comply with competition law so today, we're also announcing the launch of a new Competition Act investigation to look into that further.\"\nThe housebuilders being investigated are:\nThe CMA said it had not yet reached any conclusions as to whether or not competition law had been broken.\nBut it said that any sharing by housebuilders of non-public information - such as house prices, incentives to buy and rates of sales - may have the \"effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition\".\nHousebuilding companies listed on the London Stock Exchange saw their share prices fall in early trading. Persimmon shares fell by 2.8% to \u00c2\u00a313.74 each, closely followed by Taylor Wimpey down 2.7% at 142p.\nA spokesperson for Taylor Wimpey said the housebuilder \"notes the investigation opened today and we will co-operate fully with the CMA in relation to this\".\nA Bellway spokesperson said: \"We are reviewing the CMA's report. Bellway has engaged and co-operated fully with the CMA throughout its market study - and will continue to do so.\"\nRedrow, which recently agreed to be taken over by Barratt for \u00c2\u00a32.5bn, said that it had \"fully co-operated with the CMA throughout its market study\" and continues to work with the watchdog.\nBerkeley declined to comment.\nA spokesperson for Bloor Homes, said: \"We have been transparent with the CMA throughout the year-long study and are currently reviewing the findings.\" The firm said it would continue to work with the regulator during the investigation.\nThe BBC has contacted Barratt, Persimmon and Vistry for comment.\nIn its wider report into the housebuilding market in England, Wales and Scotland, the CMA said there were \"persistent shortfalls\" in the number of homes being built.\n\"Too few houses are being built, especially in the areas in which they are most needed, which is having a negative effect on affordability,\" it said.\nLast year, fewer than 250,000 homes were built across the whole of the UK, far below a target of 300,000 for England alone.\nIn its 2019 manifesto, the Conservative Party promised to build 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s and pledged to make the planning system \"simpler\".\nIn late 2022, Housing Secretary Michael Gove asked the CMA to conduct a market study into the UK housebuilding market, which the watchdog began in February the following year.\nThe CMA found that the planning system was one of the key factors slowing down construction of new homes, describing it as \"complex and unpredictable\".\nIt said planning often takes a long time for builders to navigate before construction can start. It found that many planning departments are under resourced, don't have up-to-date local plans and lack clear targets or incentives to deliver a certain number of homes in their area.\nBuilders also often have to consult with a wide range of people and slow responses to planning proposals can delay construction.\nThe CMA said that recommendations to streamline the planning system as well as other measures would mean more homes could be built each year and help \"make homes more affordable\".\nBut it said: \"Even then, further action may be required to deliver the number of homes Great Britain needs in the places it needs them.\"\nManagement fees\nThe report also highlighted the high costs that people who live on new-build housing estates pay for private estate management companies to maintain public amenities, including roads, sewers and open spaces.\nIt said that increasingly, private companies provide and charge for these kind of services, whereas in the past, local authorities would oversee them.\nIt means that some homeowners are paying for both private estate management and council tax.\nThe CMA said the amount charged by estate management companies each year varies, from \u00c2\u00a360 to just under \u00c2\u00a31,000 in some cases.\nIt said the average charge was \u00c2\u00a3358 in 2022 though that could increase significantly in subsequent years.\nIn some cases, a higher proportion ",
    "Following the death of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, another political prisoner is trying to keep the hope of change alive - even from behind bars.\n\"Freedom costs dearly,\" the opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza once wrote to me from a Russian prison cell.\nHe was quoting his political mentor, Boris Nemtsov, who was murdered in 2015 in Moscow - right beside the Kremlin.\nNow Russian President Vladimir Putin's biggest rival, Alexei Navalny, is dead.\nThe price of political opposition has never been higher in modern Russia or the goal of change so remote.\nSuch is the fear of reprisal that Navalny's death did not spark mass, angry protests. Several hundred people were detained just for laying flowers in his memory.\nBut Mr Kara-Murza refuses to abandon either his fight or his hope.\nThis week he urged opposition supporters to \"work even harder\" to achieve what Navalny and Nemtsov had fought for: the chance to live in a free country.\nHe made his own choice, long ago. \"The price of speaking out is high,\" the activist wrote to me, soon after his arrest in 2022.\n\"But the price of silence is unacceptable.\"\nStrong men\nAlexei Navalny, who was 47, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, 42, are very different men.\nNavalny was a social-media phenomenon, a charismatic speaker with some of the egotism of a natural-born leader.\nMr Kara-Murza is a softly spoken intellectual - more back-room lobbyist than crowd-gatherer.\nHe's not a household name in Russia even now.\nBut both men shared the same drive and a conviction that Putin's Russia was not eternal and political freedom was possible.\nWhilst Navalny produced video expos\u00c3\u00a9s of corruption at the highest level of power, Mr Kara-Murza lobbied Western governments for sanctions to target officials' assets and cash stashed abroad.\nBoth have paid dearly.\nIn 2015, five years before Navalny was attacked with a nerve agent, Mr Kara-Murza collapsed and fell into a coma.\nTwo years later, it happened again. Tests in the US confirmed he had been poisoned.\nBut he never stopped speaking his mind, which included denouncing Mr Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nLast year, Mr Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years for treason - although the charge sheet listed nothing but peaceful opposition activity.\nReturn to Russia\nWhen Alexei Navalny chose to fly back to Russia in 2021 after an attempt to kill him, some thought him foolhardy.\nOpposition figures who've chosen exile over imprisonment argue that sacrifice with no prospect of change is futile.\nNavalny thought differently.\n\"If your beliefs are worth something, you have to be prepared to stand up for them. And if necessary, make some sacrifices,\" he wrote shortly before he died on 16 February.\nVladimir Kara-Murza, like Navalny, has a wife and children. He also has residency in the US and a British passport. But he never hesitated about returning to Russia.\n\"I didn't think I had the right to continue my political activity, to call other people to action, if I was sitting safely somewhere else,\" Mr Kara-Murza wrote to me in 2022, already in prison.\nFor both men, it was an act of conscience.\nNow one is dead and the other is locked up far from his family who've only been allowed one phone call in six months.\n\"I didn't speak to him myself because I didn't want to take time away from the kids,\" Evgenia Kara-Murza described that call.\nThe activist's wife allowed the three children five minutes each.\n\"I was standing there with a timer,\" she said.\nStrong women\nThis week, Navalny's widow recorded a video statement urging his allies not to give up.\n\"I want to live in a free Russia, I want to build a free Russia,\" said Yulia Navalnaya, vowing to continue her husband's work.\nEvgenia Kara-Murza was stunned by her bravery. \"She's doing her absolute best to go through hell with her head held high and she is amazing.\"\nBut Mr Kara-Murza's wife has taken on a demanding role of her own.\nSince his arrest in April 2022, she's been travelling the world, lobbying Western officials to help her husband and other political prisoners, and denouncing Russia's war on Ukraine.\nThe invasion is more proof, as she puts it, of Putin's \"murderous regime\".\nWhen we spoke, Evgenia was about to fly back to the US to see their children. She was then heading for London to call on UK ministers to step-up their efforts for Vladimir, a joint British-Russian citizen.\n\"I want them to be more forceful in trying to get him out, and demanding proper medical attention,\" she said.\n\"But making one government care about its citizen is hard these days.\"\nPrison persecution\nMr Kara-Murza's persecution has continued in prison, as it did for Navalny.\nThe activist has been held in solitary confinement for months and allowed no personal belongings, even photographs of his children.\nIn January, he was moved to a new prison with tougher conditions, deprived even of his books.\nHis health, damaged by the poisoning, is deteriorating. Pressure for Mr Kara-Murza's release has intensified since Navalny's de",

    "Plans for an off-licence in a retirement village have been approved, despite concerns over anti-social behaviour.\nBath and North East Somerset Council have granted a new branch of One Stop at Keynsham's Chocolate Quarter, on the site of the former Cadbury's factory.\nSt Monica Trust, which runs the retirement village, backed the plans.\nA trust spokesperson said the shop will \"bring closer integration\" between retirees and private residents.\nThe new off-licence, which will be located near a school and a children's playground, would create 10-13 jobs in the area.\nThere is currently not a shop in this part of the town, the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said.\nBut in a letter of objection to the shop's alcohol licence, local resident Julie Coleman said: \"My concern is that youths may gather and make themselves a nuisance whilst gathering, also causing noise and litter.\n\"This is apparent on the local high street from late afternoon onwards.\"\n'Peace undermined'\nAnother resident, Caron Mills, added: \"Selling alcohol will act as a magnet, attracting young adults from other parts of Keynsham.\n\"There is seating in the area outside the shop which will be an inducement to stay put and consume the alcohol without moving on.\"\n\"The relative calm and peace [St Monica's residents] experience in the current environment would be compromised.\"\nSimon Lexton of the St Monica Trust said: \"Since the development opened as a retirement village in 2017, our residents have petitioned us for a shop on-site, including the provision of selling alcohol.\nOne Stop licensing manager Hardish Purewal said: \"We feel incredibly privileged to be a part of this neighbourhood.

    "A popular boxing club has said it is losing its venue because the special school which owns the building needs the space to help more pupils.\nAspire Boxing Club's current home is on the site of the Sheffield Inclusion Centre in Arbourthorne.\nFormer boxer Ronny Tucker, who runs the club, said he would have to look for alternative venues.\nThe school said a record number of children were being excluded and it needed the space.\nThe club had trained at the local authority site since 2017 and Mr Tucker said the gym kept many young people off the streets.\n\"They're not involved in crime, they're not in their bedrooms - they're here,\" he said.\nCharlie Wild, who has been training at the centre for six years said it was a \"really special place\".\n\"As a woman in boxing this means everything to me,\" she said.\n\"If you're here and want to learn they'll give you everything.\"\nFormer professional boxer Johnny Nelson said closing the gym was \"detrimental to the community\".\n\"There's no youth clubs left.

    "An angry mob in Pakistan accused a woman who wore a dress adorned with Arabic calligraphy of blasphemy, after mistaking them for Quran verses.\nShe was saved by police who escorted her to safety after hundreds gathered. She later gave a public apology.\nThe dress has the word \"Halwa\" printed in Arabic letters on it, meaning beautiful in Arabic.\nBlasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. Some people have been lynched even before their cases go on trial.\nPolice told the BBC they first received a call at about 13:10 local (08:10 GMT) on Sunday that a crowd had gathered around a woman at a restaurant in Lahore, the capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab.\nAround 300 people had crowded outside the restaurant by the time they arrived, said Assistant Superintendent Syeda Shehrbano.\nVideos of the scene circulated on social media, with one showing a woman, visibly scared, sitting in the far corner of the restaurant, shielding her face with her hand.\nIn another, she is surrounded by officers, who had formed the only barrier between her and a growing crowd who were shouting for her to remove the shirt. In some videos, people can be heard chanting that those who blaspheme must be beheaded.\nFootage shared on social media shows Ms Shehrbano standing at the restaurant's entrance, trying to restore order to an increasingly charged crowd.\n\"Nobody actually knew what was written on the shirt,\" she said. \"The major feat was to try to get that woman out of the area in order to ensure that she is safe.\"\nMs Shehrbano adds that she had to \"negotiate\" with the crowd.\n\"We told them we would take the woman with us, her actions are going to be taken into account and we're going to hold her responsible for whatever crime committed as per the law of the land.\"\nThe footage later showed Ms Shehrbano putting her arm around the woman, now covered by a black robe and a headscarf, and pushing through the crowd. Other police officers formed a chain with their arms to clear their path as people in the crowd pushed against them.\nMs Shehrbano said supporters of the hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) party were among those in the crowd.\nThe woman was brought into a police station, where several religious scholars confirmed that the text on her dress was Arabic calligraphy, not verses from the Quran.\nThe police then asked the scholars to record a video stating their findings and that the woman was innocent.\n\"I didn't have any such intention, it happened by mistake. Still I apologise for all that happened, and I'll make sure it never happens again,\" she said, adding that she is a devout Muslim and would never commit blasphemy.\nAuthorities said she was in Lahore to do some shopping, and has since left the city.\nTahir Mahmood Ashrafi, a former adviser to the prime minister on religious affairs said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the men in the crowd, rather than the woman, should have been the ones to apologise.\nMs Shehrbano said authorities have seen a \"mushrooming of incidents\" similar to that on Sunday.\n\"Had I not screamed and had I not convinced the crowd that we will do something about it, It would have turned nastier\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Thank God,\" she said. She has been widely praised, with the Chief of Punjab police calling for her to receive an award for her bravery.\nLaws against blasphemy were first codified by India's British rulers and expanded in the 1980s under the military government.\nIn August last year, scores of churches and homes were burnt in Jaranwala, a city east of Pakistan, after two men from the city were accused of damaging the Quran.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Urdu",
    "A US airman has died after setting himself on fire in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington DC on Sunday, shouting \"free Palestine\".\nAaron Bushnell, 25, was taken to hospital after Secret Service officers extinguished the flames.\nBefore setting himself alight in what he called an \"extreme act of protest\", he said he would \"no longer be complicit in genocide\".\nNo embassy staff members were injured, a spokeswoman said.\nA Pentagon spokesman called the incident, which happened at 13:00 local time (18:00 GMT), a \"tragic event\".\nIn a video aired live on streaming site Twitch, Mr Bushnell, who was dressed in military uniform, identified himself and said he was a serving member of the Air Force.\nEarlier, he had emailed a number of reporters as well as left-wing and anarchist news websites.

Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour shadow minister Lisa Nandy said she could assure people that no one from her party had threatened Sir Lindsay.\n\"The idea that any political leader or any politician of any party could threaten the House of Commons Speaker and get away with it is just absolute nonsense,\" Ms Nandy said.\n\"I certainly didn't, the chief whip didn't, the leader of the Labour party didn't,\" she added.\nHowever, it is unclear whether another debate will allow the SNP to force a vote that drives a wedge between other parties on the issue.\nIn a statement, it said it wanted to have an emergency debate on a motion setting out \"concrete actions\" the UK could take to promote a ceasefire at the United Nations.\nThe party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said this would allow MPs to \"move the debate forward\" by putting pressure on the government to take a firmer pro-ceasefire stance.\nThe SNP said it wanted to do this through a little-used Commons procedure that allows emergency debates to take place at short notice.\nBut Commons rules suggest the process allows only for a vote on a neutral motion, where MPs simply state they have generally considered an issue rather than making a decision.\nThe SNP will have to formally apply for the debate after the Commons returns on Monday, potentially prompting fresh scrutiny over Sir Lindsay's handling of Commons procedure.\nHeightened scrutiny\nAhead of last Wednesday's debate, the SNP motion called for an \"immediate ceasefire\"; Labour demanded an \"immediate humanitarian ceasefire\", while the government had also tabled its own amendment calling for an \"immediate humanitarian pause\".\nBoth Conservatives and SNP MPs were angered by the speaker who broke with convention and allowed a vote on a Labour amendment.\nThe government then withdrew from taking part in the vote in protest, meaning Labour's amendment was waved through and the SNP's motion - which was meant to be the entire focus of the day - wasn't formally voted on at all.\nSir Lindsay argued that letting MPs vote on a wider range of positions would protect them from threats to their safety, amid heightened scrutiny of their stance on the conflict.\nBut it allowed Labour to sidestep a potentially damaging rebellion over whether it supported the wording of the SNP's ceasefire call, which also criticised the \"collective punishment of the Palestinian people\".\nLabour's own amendment supported a ceasefire but noted that Israel \"cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence\".\nThis prompted accusations Sir Lindsay had played \"party politics\" with the vote, with 77 MPs since declaring no confidence in him as speaker.\nThe SNP said it would hold discussions with Sir Lindsay before publishing the motion it wants to see debated. He has already said he backs the idea of holding a further debate.\nHowever, if the SNP tables a motion detailing a range of specific demands on the government, it could put Sir Lindsay in an awkward position.\nHis predecessor, John Bercow, prompted an outcry in 2019 by allowing MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit to use such an emergency debate to take control of the Commons timetable.\nThis was seen as another controversial break with convention, by allowing an emergency debate to pave the way for MPs to make a binding decision.",
    "Former US talk show host Wendy Williams has thanked fans for their support over her dementia and aphasia diagnosis.\nWilliams, 59, said their response had been \"overwhelming\" and she had \"immense gratitude for the love and kind words\" received.\nIn a statement released to the Associated Press, the star said the messages had reminded her of \"the power of unity and the need for compassion\".\nShe hosted the nationally syndicated Wendy Williams Show for over a decade.\nIt ended in 2022 amid the health struggles she has been facing.\nHer care team announced her diagnosis on Thursday \"to correct inaccurate and hurtful rumours about her health\".\nA statement said: \"As Wendy's fans are aware, in the past she has been open with the public about her medical struggles with Graves' Disease and Lymphedema as well as other significant challenges related to her health.\n\"Over the past few years, questions have been raised at times about Wendy's ability to process information and many have speculated about Wendy's condition, particularly when she began to lose words, act erratically at times, and have difficulty understanding financial transactions.\"\nThe care team added the diagnosis was confirmed by \"a battery of medical tests\" last year.\nAphasia is a nervous system syndrome that affects the ability to communicate, with patients often struggling to express thoughts and even losing their ability to speak or write.\nFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an incurable brain disorder caused by damage to the left side of the brain that affects language and communication abilities. Its symptoms, which get worse over time, can be managed but there is no treatment that can slow or prevent their progression, the National Institutes of Health say.\nThe rare disease tends to strike people at a younger age than other forms of dementia, with most diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 64 years old.\nHollywood star Bruce Willis also suffers from aphasia and frontotemporal dementia - the conditions meant he had to give up his acting career.",
    "The first of more than 50 much-needed new ambulances are set to arrive in the south of England this month.\nSouth Central Ambulance Service (SCAS), which covers Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, has been under extreme pressure in recent times.\nAbout a quarter of its cars and vans are currently off the road.\nProblems are exacerbated with about 22% of its roles vacant, which means relying heavily on bank staff, overtime and help from private providers.\nSCAS has been battling a steep rise in seriously ill patients requiring an ambulance in the past five years, increasing from 30,748 in 2018-2019 to 41,348 in 2022-2023.\nThe BBC has spent time with the service to see the challenges.\nSpecialist practitioner Bryn Umapalan is trained to care for the seriously ill on the road and with rising ambulance delays at hospital as well as increasing pressure on beds, his type of role is seen as key to the solution, doing what they can to avoid people having to go to A&E.\nFollowing him for the day, his first call-out is to a 72-year-old woman with abdominal pain in Bracknell, Berkshire.\nDavid Sumner's wife Susan has been up all night in \"complete agony\".\n\"The service is really good, it's the second time this year that we've had to get an ambulance out and they've been within an hour at the most,\" he said.\nIn this case Mr Umapalan explains Mr Sumner's wife has \"sudden onset abdominal pain but there was no real obvious cause\" and it is decided the couple make their own way to hospital for further investigation.\nThe specialist paramedic believes more staff would also help solve some of the issues.\n\"There's staffing shortages across the NHS, there's funding issues, and equipment issues.\n\"People are living much longer with more complex diseases, we need to be able to respond to that and have the infrastructure in place to help support all these people,\" he explained.\n\"[But] we get to see some of the amazing sides of humanity and get to do some amazing things.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"There are record numbers of staff working in the NHS and our historic Long Term Workforce Plan, backed by over \u00c2\u00a32.4 billion, will train, retain, and recruit hundreds of thousands more staff - including boosting the number of paramedics by up to 15,600.\n\"Our work... is helping to improve ambulance response times with average Category 1 and Category 2 response times this year to date significantly quicker compared to last year.\n\"We have already created 5,000 extra permanent hospital beds, on top of 10,000 hospital at home beds rolled out - to free up hospital capacity and cut waiting times.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "\"This is clowntown. Welcome to the circus!\"\nThe chap offering me the warm greeting, delivered with a smile while leaning out his car window, was in Rochdale.\nBut plenty might have offered the same description of Westminster over the last day or two.\nI have spent a few days in Rochdale, in Greater Manchester, taking a look at the bizarre by election race happening there after the death of the Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd.\nBizarre for several reasons.\nThe Labour candidate Azhar Ali has been disowned by his party for allegedly antisemitic remarks for which he has apologised.\nBut there are still two former Labour MPs in the running: George Galloway and Simon Danczuk.\nWhile we were there the Conservative candidate was on holiday - a week before polling day.\nOh and the Green Party have disowned their candidate too.\nWhat a carry-on.\nBut the key thing here is the connection between Rochdale and Westminster - the conflict between Israel and Gaza.\nThe anger, the anguish, the tension it causes, stretching to breaking point conventions, language and fury.\nTo be the Speaker of the House of Commons is to sit above politics.\nAn MP formerly steeped in party politics, for all speakers start out that way, renounces their public tribal instincts and is tasked with working impartially on behalf of all their colleagues.\nSir Lindsay Hoyle, a former Labour MP, emphasised his collegiate, cross-party demeanour more than most when chasing the job - following as he was John Bercow, who critics saw as spectacularly partial on the issue of Brexit during years of furious Commons argument.\nAnd Sir Lindsay's share price among his colleagues was high, well-liked by the vast majority on all sides.\nBut, no longer.\nHis share price has taken a whack for a good number of MPs.\nPlenty of Conservative and Scottish National Party MPs I speak to are livid, convinced that whether he intended to or not, Sir Lindsay's actions dug his old party, Labour, out of a hole.\nTheir faith in him will not be easily restored. Perhaps never restored.\nEven with his apologies.\nMore pain to come?\nSenior figures in both parties tell me of their surprise too that Sir Lindsay did not make a greater effort sooner to invite them in to try to take some of the heat out of things.\nThe question now is whether that anger coagulates into an ongoing zeal to make his position untenable, either by more MPs demanding he resigns, or by refusing to co-operate with him in the day-to-day functioning of Parliament.\nThe alternative is it eases as attention turns back to the imminence of the general election and the party political battles each party and each MP running again soon faces.\nPlus, MPs have to ponder if whoever they might end up with instead of Sir Lindsay would actually amount to an improvement in their eyes.\nMr Bercow was deeply disliked by many MPs - particularly Conservatives - during a fair chunk of his time as Speaker.\nHe managed to motor on through no end of gripes and flashpoints. Sometimes momentum builds, and then dissipates.\nBut sometimes it carries on building. Sir Lindsay has not before encountered as rough a few days as Speaker as these.\nIt is a deeply uncomfortable time for him.\nAnd the discomfort is not over yet.",
    "A second six-figure donation is to be made to Worcester's museum charity which will help develop a new gallery and set up an internship programme.\nPhilanthropist Martin Cook, who is originally from the city but now lives in the US, is making the \"significant\" donation, the charity said.\nThe new gallery will display fine and decorative art, including a nationally important glove collection.\nIt follows a \u00c2\u00a3300,000 donation made by Prof Rolf Olsen in 2022.\nWorcester City Art Gallery and Museum said at the time the money would be spent purchasing more artworks and laying the foundations for the new gallery.\nConfirming the second donation, the charity said the new galleries would highlight Worcestershire as \"a place of inspiration for artists\" and display the work of artists who came to the area to work, including Paul Nash and Laura Knight.\n\"They will also celebrate Worcester's strength as a centre for design education in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when it supported the city's international porcelain and glove industries,\" it said.\n\"At its core will be the new Shirley and Rolf Olsen Gallery, with a permanent display of Worcester's outstanding collection of works by British Impressionist artists.\"\nMeanwhile, the internships will nurture creative talent in the city and help young people entering the museum profession and establish a national art prize competition, the charity added.\nMr Cook was inspired to make his donation after reading about Prof Olsen's gift and \"shares the same enthusiasm and vision to enhance the cultural life of Worcester and hopes that others will follow suit\", it said.\nThe museum intends to show gloves by famous fashion designers such as Manolo Blahnik as part of its exhibition about Worcester's role in the international gloving trade.\nMr Cook added: \"I'm keen to play a part in Worcester's cultural development and Professor Olsen's ambitions struck a chord with me.\n\"My wish is to support the development of the Art Gallery and Museum, celebrate the rich heritage of the city I grew up in and build on Professor Olsen's legacy.\"\nCaroline Naisbitt, from the charity, said it was \"extremely grateful\" for his very generous donation.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "A woman has been spared jail after she helped her ex-partner \"case\" a Nottinghamshire art gallery before the theft of a \u00c2\u00a33.5m tiara.\nKelly Duong was given a two-year jail sentence, suspended for 21 months.\nShe admitted conspiracy to burgle after she was seen filming alongside career criminal Ashley Cumberpatch and others at the Harley Gallery in the Welbeck Estate in Worksop in 2017.\nOne year later the tiara, worn to the coronation of Edward VII, was stolen.\nAs Duong was sentenced, the judge accepted she was heavily influenced by Cumberpatch, who was jailed for 24 years in 2022 for his part in a string of raids, including one in which former England footballer Ashley Cole was tied up.\nDuong, 35, was told she was seen filming alongside Cumberpatch and others at the Harley Gallery in 2017, a year before the theft of the tiara.\nPassing sentence at Nottingham Crown Court, Judge James Sampson told Duong - who pleaded guilty on the basis she did not know which items would be taken - that she and Cumberpatch had \"masqueraded\" as innocent day-trippers during the gang's surveillance of the gallery.\nHe told Duong: \"There was significant planning - the loss to the nation has been significant. The diamonds [from the tiara] will never be recovered.\"\nThe court heard Duong was on bail when she visited the gallery, having been arrested for possessing a shortened shotgun, related to a \"willingness to do Cumberpatch's bidding.\"\nShe was later jailed for possessing the weapon, receiving an 18-month sentence in 2019.\nDuong, formerly of an address in Nottingham's Arboretum area, said through her barrister that her relationship with Cumberpatch was now over.\nThe judge added there had been clear planning for the Harley Gallery break-in, but Duong had played a limited role.\nA previous court hearing was told the 6th Duke of Portland commissioned Cartier to create the Portland Tiara for his wife Winifred, Duchess of Portland.\nShe wore the diamond-encrusted headpiece, which had the Portland Diamond as its centrepiece, to the coronation of King Edward, Queen Elizabeth II's great-grandfather, in 1902.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "Estonia's prime minister has told the BBC that leaders risk ignoring lessons from the 1930s and 1940s if they do not bolster support for Ukraine.\nIn a striking warning, Kaja Kallas said that war could expand \"very fast in Europe, so no country is left untouched\" if Vladimir Putin wins.\nThe leader of Estonia, which borders Russia, called on Ukraine's allies to \"do the utmost to help\".\nMs Kallas has also urged Nato countries to increase their defence spending.\nCurrently, Nato members are asked to contribute 2% of their GDP to defence. Ms Kallas wants Nato countries to increase defence spending to 3% of their GDP.\nIn an interview on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Kallas said: \"Russia will not continue if they lose in Ukraine, they will continue if they win in Ukraine, that's why it's very important for all of us that we do the utmost to help them right now.\n\"Because, what are the lessons from the 1930s and 1940s?

Because the threat was real, there was a Cold War going on, now there is a hot war going on in Europe, and still some countries think that it doesn't really concern them,\" she said.\nMs Kallas has made her comments as American politicians continue to wrangle over the latest package of financial support for Ukraine, which has been held up by Republicans in Washington DC.\nOther Western leaders are visiting Ukraine over the weekend, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has released a statement saying the UK will do \"whatever it takes\" to support the war torn country.\nMs Kallas was recently named on Putin's 'wanted' list. But she says it is a 'great honour', and is not afraid - despite the death of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny last week.\nShe said: \"I got a lot of messages of congratulations, that it's a great honour, that it's the biggest award that one can get, for standing up for your principles.\n\"But jokes aside, this shows that Putin's playbook hasn't changed, this is trying to eliminate all the competition, all the competitors in the political life of Russia, trying to intimidate his opponents, and sow fear within our societies, so that we would refrain from the decisions that we would otherwise make.\n\"I mean, supporting Ukraine, being very vocal about this, advocating also increasing defence expenditure within the Nato countries.\n\"So this is meant to make me afraid, and the only response is that shouldn't be afraid.\"",
    "It's midday at a gym in central London and Charles Carroll has just finished his first Hyrox class.\n\"I'm exhausted but it was very rewarding,\" the 30-year-old says.\nHe was part of a class of 20, but across London thousands of people are lacing their trainers for this new fitness trend.\nThey are part of a rapidly growing global movement that is said to have witnessed a 1,000% increase in participation in the past five years.\nLeading today's session in Paddington was The Gym Group's master trainer, Jenni Tardiff.\nShe says Hyrox is essentially \"a global fitness race\".\n\"Basically, you run one kilometre (0.6 miles) and then it's followed by a functional exercise like a sled push or a rowing machine.\"\nCompeting in either pairs, quartets or on their own, participants must complete eight stages - a total of 8km (5 miles), although you don't have to formally compete to get involved with the training routine .\nThe word Hyrox itself doesn't actually mean anything but it all started back in 2017 as a race.\nChristian Toetzke, alongside Olympic champion hockey player Moritz F\u00c3\u00bcrste, set up the first race in their home country of Germany.\nThe inaugural event saw 650 participants - fast-forward to today and Hyrox says almost 200,000 competitors are dotted around the world.\nIn London, the first race in 2021 saw 522 participants. Jump to 2023 and more than 24,000 people took part across two races.\nHyrox is most popular among 35 to 39-year-olds and the London Hyrox races saw an average age of 37.\nThe gender-ratio has evened out since its inception, with women making up 48% of those registered for this year's London race, an increase from 42% at the first race.\nThe ability to train in groups, and to use a range of equipment, has also attracted people to the programme.\nSocial media has promoted the pastime, with '#hyroxlondon' garnering millions of views on TikTok and tens of thousands Instagram posts.\n\"I like weightlifting and having the right conditioning is really important, so being able to combine all the exercises is really great,\" says 28-year-old Pushi.\nShe's at the class on her lunch break and has brought along her friend Eva for her first class.\n\"It was my first time and I loved everything... I'd heard about it a lot on social media so I definitely wanted to try it and see how it is.\"\nAcross London, more and more gyms are offering Hyrox classes.\nOne participant is London-based The Gym Group, which first offered Hyrox classes in March last year at one of its venues. This has since expanded to 14 gyms across the capital offering classes.\n\"It really quickly became the most popular class in the gym,\" says Ms Tardiff.\n\"It started off with members who maybe knew about Hyrox and then it just exploded into everybody.\"\nWhile the trend might be taking off it isn't something that is cheap.\nThe prices to enter the race begin at the \u00c2\u00a370 mark, while the average gym membership in the capital is \u00c2\u00a340 a month, according to research by the Times newspaper.\nBut so far, this hasn't proved to be a deterrent as the next London race in May has already sold out.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X , formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram .

    "Fifteen people have been killed and more than 40 injured after a fire ripped through an apartment building in eastern China, local authorities said.\nFootage shared on social medal showed flames and plumes of black smoke engulfing several floors of a skyscraper in Nanjing city.\nOfficials suggested the blaze started on the first floor of the building, where electric bikes were being stored.\nBut the specific cause of the fire remained under investigation.\nThe building is located in the Yuhuatai district of Nanjing, a city of more than eight million that lies about 162 miles (260km) north-west of Shanghai.\nEmergency service crews were first alerted to the blaze at 04:40 local time (20:40 GMT) on Friday, officials said on Saturday morning.\nTwenty-five fire engines and 130 firefighters were sent to tackle to the blaze.

    "Iain Packer has been jailed for at least 36 years for the murder of Emma Caldwell in remote woods 19 years ago.\nThe 27-year-old's death in April 2005 had been one of Scotland's most high-profile unsolved murders.\nPolice have apologised for how the original inquiry was handled and for letting down Emma and other victims.\nEmma's family said she had been failed by police due to a \"toxic culture of misogyny and corruption\" which left Packer free to rape other women.\nThe Scottish government said it would consider holding a public inquiry into what went wrong with the original investigation.\nThe 51-year-old was found guilty of Emma's murder and 32 other charges including 11 rapes and multiple sexual assaults against a total of 22 women.\nPacker was found guilty of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by dumping her body in Limefield Woods, South Lanarkshire, and disposing of her belongings, and of indecently assaulting her.\nEmma's body was found in the woods in May 2005, five weeks after the sex worker was last seen in Glasgow city centre.\nPacker was cleared of a further three charges - one indecent assault and two sexual assaults - against a further three women, after the jury returned not proven verdicts.\nThe sentence is the second longest ever handed down by a Scottish court, behind the 37 year minimum jail term given to World's End killer Angus Sinclair in 2014 .\nPacker remained impassive in the dock at the High Court in Glasgow as the verdicts were delivered by the jury.\nIn the public gallery, Emma's mother Margaret Caldwell, 76, wept and was comforted by relatives as her daughter's killer was finally brought to justice.\nMrs Caldwell told BBC Scotland News she could \"breathe again\" now that Packer had been found guilty.\nShe added: \"When they found Emma's body, and they came in and told me they had found her body, I just took this huge breath in and now I feel as if I can let it out.\n\"I can breathe again and go on.

She will always be my Emma.\"\nThe family's lawyer, Aamer Anwar, described Packer as being \"one of the UK's worst sex offenders\" and called for a \"robust\" judge-led public inquiry into the original police investigation, adding that some officers had \"blood on their hands\".\nFour Turkish men were initially charged with Emma's murder in 2007 before the case against them collapsed the following year.\nMr Anwar added: \"A toxic culture of misogyny and corruption meant the police failed so many women and girls who came forward to speak up against Packer.\n\"Instead of receiving justice and compassion, they were humiliated, dismissed and in some instances arrested, while the police gifted freedom to an evil predator to rape and rape again.\"\nDuring sentencing, Judge Lord Beckett said Packer \"pursued a campaign of violence and appalling sexual mistreatment of a very large number of women\".\nThe judge added: \"You have caused great harm to so many people as you indulged your pathologically selfish and brutal sexual desires.\"\nHe added that Packer preyed on the vulnerable and caused \"extreme and enduring suffering for so many women and their families\".\nThe judge told the killer: \"You murdered a capable and compassionate, intelligent young woman who had planned to extricate herself from the difficult life she had been living\".\nLord Beckett continued: \"Emma was alone, in the dark, deprived of her phone and miles from any prospect of help\".\nThe judge said Emma was taken from her family at a time when she was trying to take steps to change her life adding she was killed in \"truly terrifying circumstances\".\nLord Beckett added: \"For years you lied time and again before you were undone by your arrogance in thinking that you were in the clear and entitled to compensation from the police who had investigated you.\"\nHe thanked the jurors, who took four days to reach their verdicts, for their \"extraordinary service\" during the six-week trial and excused them all from jury service for life.\nDuring the trial, the jury was taken to Limefield Woods, where Emma's body was found, to allow them to see the remote location for themselves.\nEmma had been living in a hostel in Glasgow at the time she went missing.\nShe had left home after becoming addicted to heroin and began working as a prostitute to fund her habit.\nHer mother, Margaret Caldwell, told the trial that she last saw her daughter when she dropped her off at the hostel on Sunday 3 April 2005.\nShe and her late husband, William, searched for Emma for weeks after she went missing.\nPacker, who was 32 at the time, had driven Emma to the remote forest near Biggar, where he strangled her and disposed of her naked body.\nA major murder inquiry was launched after Emma's body was discovered by a dog walker the following month.\nOver the next two years police took hundreds of statements as they investigated the murder.\nHer picture was projected onto a derelict block of flats in Glasgow and a reconstruction featured on the BBC's ",
    "A huge crowd has attended the state funeral of Namibian President Hage Geingob following his death at the age of 82 from cancer.\nMr Geingob was interred in a mausoleum at Heroes' Acre on the outskirts of the capital, Windhoek, as mourners paid tribute to a man they hailed as a nation-builder and a pan-African hero.\nHis widow, Monica Geingos, wept as his casket was lowered into his grave.\nMr Geingob's funeral marked the culmination of three weeks of mourning.\nMr Geingob died in hospital on 4 February, with his deputy, Nangolo Mbumba, sworn in as his successor soon afterwards.\nHis death led to a surge in patriotism, with Namibians from across the political divide coming together to mourn.\nThousands of people - many carrying the Namibian flag and draped in the national colours - lined the streets as his casket was driven through Windhoek on Friday and Saturday.\nHis body lay in state at Independence Stadium, before being taken on Sunday, in a gun-mounted carriage, to Heroes' Acre.\nHuge screens were put up so that the public could see his funeral.\nThe military gave Mr Geingob a 21-gun salute while K-8 fighter jets flew past.\nThis was the first time Namibia had buried a president since its independence from South Africa, then under white-minority rule, in 1990.\nDescribed as the chief mourner, Mr Mbumba said Mr Geingob was unwavering in his commitment to the nation.\n\"Your impact on us has been profound, your footprint on this nation is immense. You leave our country in better shape,\" he said.\nMr Geingob's two predecessors, Sam Nujoma and Hifikepunye Pohamba, attended his burial, along with almost 20 heads of state and government.\nGermany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier was among the dignitaries who spoke at Mr Geingob's memorial on Saturday.\nThe privately owned Namibian newspaper quoted him as saying that Germany should apologise for the atrocities it committed in Namibia during colonial rule.\n\"I believe it is high time to tender an apology to Namibia. My only regret is that Geingob will not be there to close the process he started,\" Mr Steinmeier was quoted as saying.\nNamibia was under German colonial rule from 1884 till World War One. In 2021, Germany acknowledged committing genocide there.\nGerman colonisers massacred more than 70,000 Herero and Nama people between 1904 and 1908, in what historians consider to be the 20th Century's first genocide.\nMr Geingob was first elected president of Namibia in 2015, and had been involved in talks with Germany to secure reparations.\nHe was due to step down later this year, following the end of his two terms.\nYou may also be interested in:",

    "Big events can shake everything. Small moments come to matter too.\nI remember day one of the EU referendum campaign - Vote Leave had just unveiled their infamous \u00c2\u00a3350m slogan. At the campaign's first big rally in Manchester I asked Boris Johnson about that misleading headline claim. The audience booed. It wasn't a big deal, it wasn't upsetting, but that small moment was a total surprise.\nOne of the campaign team even called me afterwards to apologise, vowing it would never happen again. They hoped the referendum campaign wouldn't be ugly. They were wrong.\nI remember a huge, dreadful day eight weeks later. We'd been interviewing Jeremy Corbyn in Sheffield in the final frantic moments of that same campaign. It was not long after his supporters had also started to boo and jeer at reporters for asking questions. Any hopes of a civil campaign were long gone.\nEight weeks later there was a huge and massive shock. We were in the middle of the usual rush to edit and send our report for the news that night. My editor called saying that the MP Jo Cox had been attacked, and it looked very bad. I stopped what we'd been doing, rushed to the station, and began making calls to try to find out what was going on. When I got to the platform, my phone rang again. Jo had died.\nHer killer, Thomas Mair, had a long history of interest in Nazism and far-right extremism. His violent obsessions certainly didn't begin with the referendum campaign. But Jo's courageous husband, Brendan, told me a few days later he believed she was murdered for her political views.\nHe said she had been worried about how politics was \"coarsening\", becoming too \"tribal and unthinking\". Her death was a hideous shock. Politicians vowed to follow her example of kindness. You don't need me to tell you whether they stuck to that.\nIt was a private conversation with another Labour MP a few years later that hammered home how common the threats were becoming.  It was September 2018, and after a couple of years of Brexit frustrations in Parliament - and hideous infighting in the Labour Party - the MP was in agony over the dangers they faced just for doing their job.\nThey'd been appealing to their local police force after weeks of threats in their constituency, but felt they were being brushed off.\nThey told me about the security grilles, cameras, alarms, and other equipment they'd installed to try to keep them and their staff safe.  But the MP didn't want to go public, fearing it would make matters worse.  It was no secret that lots of them had received abuse by that stage - in real life, not just on social media. It was a familiar topic of conversation around Westminster's ancient corridors.\nAs reporters, we were by then used to being hassled and heckled around the fringes of the demonstrations that had become part of Westminster's daily backdrop. I'd developed a habit of walking as quickly as I could with my head down past the crowds.\nBut from that moment, I understood a shocking new norm - some MPs were carrying genuine fears for their lives every day. \"These threats are real,\" they said. Their tears and distress made it plain.\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\nA couple of months later, I remember those regular demonstrations taking a different turn. A couple of small groups would walk alongside MPs as they tried to move around the tiny SW1 postcode, hurling abuse and accusations at close quarters and recording them on their phones.\nYou could see these groups huddling and waiting for a famous face, ready to pounce.  If the politician responded in any way,  these groups had footage that might go viral. Ignore it, the politician could be accused of being rude and shunning the public's voice. The first few times I saw it, it felt shocking. It seemed to be deliberate provocation for the purposes of creating content for social media.\nDuring that whole period, just as now, there were many people with strong and deeply held views using their legitimate right to protest. Goodness knows, the public's frustration with politicians is often entirely understandable.\nProtest is important. Many MPs themselves are veterans of noisy demonstrations. Politicians love a good argument - a vigorous debate. And of course there have been risks to politicians and Parliament before, whether from the IRA for many years, or terror threats in recent times.\nBut surrounding politicians and screaming abuse, or trying to block their path as they try to walk down the street, are different.  Now, almost any MP will tell you, what can look like an ambush can happen at any time.\nThese moments I remember, big and small, track what has been a journey to a different kind of politics.  Many of the people we choose to represent us really believe their personal safety, and that of their families, is routinely at stake.\nAnd this week marks another major moment.

    "A man who was stabbed outside a Halifax club with two friends did not realise he had been injured until someone told him he was bleeding, a court has heard.\nBrandon Coupe, 18, suffered a stab wound along with Joshua Clark, 21, and Haidar Shah, 19, who both died on Commercial Street last October.\nRashane Douglas, 19, of Huddersfield, denies murder and attempted murder.\nBradford Crown Court heard Mr Coupe tell police he saw his friends on the floor then \"realised they were gone\".\nIn a police interview which was shown to the court, he said: \"I just remember seeing them on the floor and I tried to help them both.\n\"I noticed that there was blood coming out of me and I just fell on the floor.\n\"They said to me, you're bleeding, I said no I'm not, then I realised that I was.\n\"I couldn't do anything to help them.\"\nThe prosecution's case is that an argument broke out when Mr Douglas arrived at Maggie's nightclub earlier that night, only to find that a woman he had been expecting to meet - called Kiera Hamilton - was already with Mr Shah.\nFor the defence, Naeem Mian KC told the court Mr Douglas was acting in self-defence, only producing a knife when he \"sustained punch after punch\".\nSpeaking about Mr Douglas, he said: \"That young man is not the aggressor. That young man is approached by three individuals, at night, outside a club.\n\"That young man doesn't throw the first punch. That young man doesn't pursue individuals across the road, they pursue him.\n\"Only when he sustained punch after punch after punch to his face, only then is a knife produced.\"\nThe defence barrister said Mr Coupe was \"drunk and out looking for trouble\" - a claim which Mr Coupe denied.\nEarlier, the court heard evidence from Ms Hamilton, who said she had been messaging both Mr Douglas and Mr Shah that evening.\nShe said she was not in a relationship with either of the men, but was \"close\" to Mr Shah, and had been \"talking\" to Mr Douglas, although she had not seen him for about a year before that night.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "The two biggest political parties at Westminster and Parliament itself are finding themselves buckled, bent and contorted by the furious arguments provoked by the Israel-Gaza war.\nFor the Conservatives, the Lee Anderson row about Islamophobia.\nFor Parliament, the Commons Speaker row about a ceasefire and parliamentary procedure .\nAnd for Labour, the Rochdale row about antisemitism and the by-election there in a few days .\nThe prime minister's week began with a trio of BBC local radio interviews, where alongside questions about spending on transport projects in the north of England he was inevitably asked about his former deputy chairman's remarks .\nIt's only a few weeks back that Rishi Sunak and Mr Anderson were doing a joint campaign video .\nNow Mr Sunak is distancing himself from Mr Anderson.\nBut the prime minister, like his deputy, is not describing what Lee Anderson said as Islamophobic.\nIn fact, a row about that very word has broken out within the Conservative Party, with former chairman Baroness Warsi at loggerheads with the Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch over it.\nNext, the Speaker of the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle starts the week with the third biggest party, the SNP, saying it doesn't have confidence in him.\nAnd Conservative MPs' WhatsApp groups are inflamed too, I hear, the sentiment of many being \"how can we ever trust him again?\"\nAs it stands, 72 MPs have signed a Commons motion saying he should go .\nThis may all mean Sir Lindsay concludes he has no option but to address the issue - either by standing down or saying he will at the election.\nBut the pressure on him seems to have eased a little - or not got worse - for now at least.\nThe SNP's focus is on securing a debate where they can shift the dial on the government's approach to the Israel-Hamas war.\nThey want one under what is known as standing order 24 .\nIt only allows for the Commons to consider something, rather than vote on a substantive question, which is what the SNP want.\nWhich leaves the Speaker in a bind: fail to give them what they want, or bend parliamentary conventions again - which is what got him into trouble in the first place.\nMeanwhile, I hear some of the smaller parties have been comparing notes on how they feel they are treated by the Speaker and will see him later to set out their argument too.\nAnd then there is Labour. The Rochdale by-election is on Thursday and the party that aspires to be in government before the year is out is a mere bystander, a spectator - after their candidate was accused of antisemitism and the party disowned him.\nWhat we are seeing is a noisy, angry mess on three fronts and two big central questions: what is it legitimate to say about different communities or religious groups?\nAnd, in an election year, is it in the interests of our political parties to seek to calm things down, or crank things up?\nRight now, the evidence suggests the latter.",

    "The parents of a child killed by a runaway car have told of their anguish over a \"loophole\" in the law which means some driving offences do not apply on private land.\nPearl Black died in 2017 after Andrew Williams failed to properly apply the handbrake on his Range Rover.\nThis resulted in the empty vehicle rolling downhill from a driveway and knocking a wall on to her.\nNo criminal proceedings have been brought against Mr Williams.\nThe Merthyr Tydfil family's local MP, Gerald Jones, is trying to get a law change through Parliament to extend careless and dangerous driving offences to cover private land next to roads.\nThe UK government said its thoughts were with Pearl's family, and that existing laws were always kept under review.\nPearl's father, Paul Black, and brother Ace were also injured. They had been on their way to the park.\nMr Black, who was a contestant on The Voice, said losing Pearl had ruined their lives.\n\"There's no words to describe how some days it makes me feel,\" he said.\nPearl's mother, Gemma Black, said her daughter's death \"impacts everything\".\n\"Things you used to look forward to, happy times, are now tinged with sadness.\n\"The kids love Christmas and it's great to see them, but it's always on your mind - there's one missing.\"\nMr Black said he believed current road traffic laws were not fit for purpose, describing some as neglectful and in need of \"dragging completely up to date\".\nThe couple said their spirits were lifted when their MP raised their calls for change with Rishi Sunak during prime minister's questions in November.\n\"After all of the years of nothing happening, then all of a sudden the prime minister's saying Pearl's name on the television,\" said Ms Black.\nBut a promised meeting with ministers has yet to take place.\nThe Blacks said while it was too late to make a difference in their case, they want to see the introduction of Pearl's Law so no-one else has to go through what they have.\n\"Hopefully this never happens to anybody again but if it did then hopefully other families wouldn't be so utterly let down by the justice system as we have been,\" said Ms Black.\nMr Black added: \"It's a stroke of a pen for the legacy of such a beautiful child.\"\nLabour MP Mr Jones is trying to get measures added to the criminal justice bill going through Parliament to resolve what he said was an \"anomaly\".\nHis proposed amendment, which has cross-party support, would extend the Road Traffic Act 1988 so that a range of driving offences covering a road or public place would also apply to private land adjacent to roads.\n\"It could be drives, it could be verges, it could be lots of areas that are adjacent to the highway but not necessarily public highway,\" said Mr Jones.\nThe CPS said: \"This was a deeply tragic case and our thoughts remain with Pearl's family.\n\"We reviewed the evidence very carefully and considered three different potential charges, but ultimately we must apply the law and in this instance there was not enough evidence to bring a prosecution - a decision which was backed by an internal review of the case.\"\nA legal framework is in place for accidents that take place on private land.\nIn such circumstances, a victim may be able to make a civil claim for compensation.\nProsecutions might also, in some circumstances, be brought under health and safety legislation and, in extreme cases, for other criminal law offences such as gross negligence manslaughter.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Transport said: \"The government recognises the impact of dangerous driving wherever it occurs, and we always keep existing law under review to ensure our communities remain safe.\"",

    "Texan company Intuitive Machines (IM) will attempt to put a spacecraft on the Moon in the coming hours.\nIf the firm succeeds, it will be the first ever commercial venture to achieve the feat.\nIt would also represent the first American soft landing on the lunar surface since the Apollo era just over half a century ago.\nIM has been contracted by the US space agency (Nasa) to carry scientific instruments to the Moon's south pole.\nThe targeted landing site is a cratered terrain next to a 5km-high mountain complex known as Malapert. The region is one of the locations on Nasa's shortlist of places to send astronauts later this decade as part of its Artemis programme.\nThe instrumentation should give planners some fresh insights on what surface conditions are like.\nControllers at Intuitive Machines are aiming for a touchdown around 23:24 GMT, although the company has shifted this time back and forth in recent hours.\n\"The six Nasa payloads and six commercial payloads expect to operate on the lunar surface for seven days before the Sun sets on our landing site at Malapert A Crater on the south pole of the Moon, rendering the IM-1 mission complete. During this time, we will be performing some amazing experiments and technology demonstrations,\" said Trent Martin, the company's vice president of space systems.\nIM's effort follows that of another private concern, Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic, which set off for the Moon in early January but couldn't even attempt a landing because of technical problems.\nThe Japanese space agency (Jaxa) had better fortune at the end of the month , reaching the surface safely on 19 January, although it lost several days of operations because it landed awkwardly, leaving its solar array pointing away from the Sun.\nIM's 675kg Odysseus lander is about the size of an old British telephone box. It was despatched from Earth on 15 February and was captured into orbit around the Moon on Wednesday this week.\nControllers will monitor the spacecraft's descent at the company HQ in Houston but it will be Odysseus itself that will be taking the key decisions on approach.\nInitially at 100km altitude, Odysseus will use its guidance system to bring itself to a point roughly 30km above the designated landing site, and then drop straight down. The big engine on board is expected to slow the descent to just one-metre-per-second at the moment of landing.\nIf the mission gets down safely it will be the southernmost landing yet executed. The Indian space agency (Isro) currently holds this record, thanks to its historic Chandrayaan-3 Vikram lander, which settled on the lunar terrain in August last year at 69 degrees South.\nIM's target is at 80 degrees South, a mere 300km from the south pole proper.\nThe mission is part of Nasa's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme , in which the agency is paying various private American companies for transport services to the Moon - in this particular case, with a fee of $118M (\u00c2\u00a393m).\n\"With commercial industry comes a competitive environment, which means that our investment up front ultimately gets far more for far less,\" explained Nasa's CLPS project scientist Susan Lederer.\n\"Instead of one (Nasa) mission in a decade, it allows for more like 10 commercial missions to the Moon in a decade; instead of four or five instruments in that one decade, it's more like four to five dozen instruments.\"\nNasa's six instruments are joined on Odysseus by payloads from six other IM customers.\nThese include a student camera system from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University which will be deployed from Odysseus when it is still 30m above the lunar surface. The camera will try to take selfie images as the spacecraft touches down.\nThe American artist Jeff Koons has also attached a box to the side of the lander that contains 125 small stainless steel balls to represent the Moon's different phases through a month.\nAnd there'll even be a telescope from the International Lunar Observatory Association on board, taking pictures of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Moon is an ideal place to do astronomical research because it doesn't suffer from some of the confounding effects experienced on Earth, such as a blurry atmosphere and radio interference.\nNasa's payloads will concentrate on getting information that will be useful to future human exploration. There are novel technologies on Odysseus to aid precise navigation and to know exactly how much propellant is available to a craft's thrusters.\nThere will also be investigations of lunar dust, which the Apollo astronauts found to be a serious nuisance, scratching and clogging their equipment.\nThe agency's scientists want to understand better how the dust is kicked up by landing craft to hang just above the surface before then eventually settling back down.\nHistorically, about half of all soft landings on the Moon have succeeded.\nThis is true even in the modern era, in this century, which started with China's Chang'e-3 mission in 2013. It worked, but of the ",

    "The UK has withdrawn from an international treaty that lets fossil-fuel companies sue governments pursuing climate policies for billions in compensation for lost profits.\nThe Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) is meant to make it easier and cheaper to trade energy between countries.\nBut signatories have struggled to reform it - and late on Wednesday, the UK quit the treaty calling it \"outdated\".\nGreen campaigners welcomed the news.\nEnergy Security and Net Zero Minister Graham Stuart said: \"Remaining a member would not support our transition to cleaner, cheaper energy and could even penalise us for our world-leading efforts to deliver net zero.\"\nSince 2001, nearly 160 legal actions based on the ECT have been brought by investors claiming their investments had been damaged by green policies such as renewable-energy subsidies, and seeking compensation from governments.\nLeo Mercer, policy analyst at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, told the BBC: \"[The treaty] was designed to protect energy companies from sudden policy decisions that undermine their investments.\n\"However, it has been abused by the oil and gas industry over the past few years... to the detriment of British consumers.\"\nIn recent years, countries implementing climate-change strategies have tried to exclude fossil-fuel companies from being able to take legal action.\nBut after more than 15 rounds of negotiations, signatories were unable to agree when this should happen.\nAnd the UK's withdrawal follows that of France, Spain and Germany, who worried the ECT would see them facing legal action from all sides - companies claiming they had breached the treaty and green organisations claiming they were not fulfilling their climate commitments.\nIn 2009, Germany faced a $1.9bn (\u00c2\u00a31.5bn) claim by Swedish energy company Vattendal, after delays for permits to operate a coal-fired power station.\n'More freedom'\nKierra Box, of Friends of the Earth, said: \"Leaving this incredibly flawed treaty is a brilliant win for our environment and the climate.\n\"Future UK governments will now have more freedom to take ambitious action to protect our planet, without the threat of being sued for millions of pounds by companies based overseas.\"\nChris Skidmore, the Conservative MP who led the government's review into its net-zero policies, said he was \"pleased\" with the withdrawal, having called for it for over a year.\nThe government said the withdrawal would take affect in one year - but what will happen to cases already in progress remains unclear.\nThe UK-listed Ascent Resources company is suing Slovenia, after its environment agency requested an impact assessment on the redevelopment of an oil and gas field.\nBBC Radio 4's Law in Action programme examines how the law is dealing with the challenges of climate change.",
    "Sadiq Khan has described remarks by the former Tory deputy chairman as \"pouring fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred\".\nLee Anderson told GB News \"Islamists\" had \"got control\" of the mayor of London.\nHis words, which follow pro-Palestinian protests outside Parliament, have been condemned by some Conservatives.\nBut Mr Khan criticised Rishi Sunak and his Cabinet for what he called a \"deafening silence\".\nOn Friday, Mr Anderson told GB News: \"I don't actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they've got control of Khan and they've got control of London\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He's actually given our capital city away to his mates.\"\nThe Ashfield MP's remarks prompted criticism from Labour and some Conservatives - including former chancellor Sir Sajid Javid who reposted the video of Mr Anderson making the comments and wrote \"a ridiculous thing to say\".\nIn response, Mr Khan described Mr Anderson's comments as \"Islamophobic, anti-Muslim and racist\".\n\"These comments pour fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred,\" Mr Khan said.\n\"I'm afraid the deafening silence from Rishi Sunak and from the Cabinet is condoning this racism and confirms to many people across the country there is a hierarchy when it comes to racism in this country.\n\"I am unclear why Rishi Sunak and members of his Cabinet aren't calling this out and condemning this.\"\nEarlier on Saturday, Labour called for Mr Anderson to lose the party whip - which would essentially expel him from his party in Parliament.\nUntil January Mr Anderson served as one of the deputy chairmen of the Conservative Party, but he resigned so he could rebel against the government over the Rwanda vote.\nHis comments followed an article by former home secretary Suella Braverman in the Daily Telegraph, in which she said \"the truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the anti-Semites are in charge now\".\nA Tory source earlier told the BBC: \"Lee was simply making the point that the mayor, in his capacity as police and crime commissioner for London, has abjectly failed to get a grip on the appalling Islamist marches we have seen in London recently.\"\nBut Neil Garratt, leader of Conservatives at City Hall, said he had \"no shortage of criticisms of Mayor Khan\" but added \"he is not an Islamist, he is not in the pockets of Islamists, and I completely disagree with anyone who says otherwise\".\nMohammed Amin, a former chair of the Conservative Muslim Forum who resigned after Boris Johnson became leader in 2019 and is now a Liberal Democrat, told the BBC politicians have a responsibility around the language they use and explained what kind of action he would expect to see from the Conservative Party.\n\"I would have expected the prime minister to take immediate action by denouncing the comments and calling Mr Anderson into Downing Street to explain himself,\" he said.\n\"If he failed to give a satisfactory explanation, then to consider removing the whip from him.\n\"That's the kind of action I would have expected David Cameron to take in the good old days, but sadly the Conservative Party has deteriorated very badly since then.\"\nThe BBC has approached Mr Anderson and the government for comment.",

    "The former chairman of the Post Office twice asked for boss Nick Read's pay to be doubled, MPs heard on Wednesday.\nHenry Staunton was trying to prevent Mr Read from quitting the scandal-hit organisation.\nHowever, the requests were refused, Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake said in response to an urgent question in the House of Commons.\nIt comes as hundreds of sub-postmasters wait for compensation as the long-running Horizon IT scandal continues.\nNick Read became chief executive of the Post Office in 2019 as the organisation dealt with the fall-out and declining revenues.\nThe latest figures show his salary for 2022-23 stood at \u00c2\u00a3573,000, including bonuses.\nThe year before, he earned \u00c2\u00a3816,000, of which \u00c2\u00a3415,000 was salary and the rest bonus. This does reflect the fact he agreed to repay a \u00c2\u00a354,500 portion of his bonus that was linked to the Post Office's participation in the official inquiry.\nIn the year 2020-21, he did not get a bonus, and was paid \u00c2\u00a3415,000.\nEven without being doubled, this salary looks high compared with the annual median UK wage of \u00c2\u00a334,963, while the average takings for sub-postmasters is lower.\nHowever, the average award for FTSE 100 bosses stands at \u00c2\u00a33.81m per year.\nMr Staunton referred to the pay requests during a Commons Business Select Committee hearing on Tuesday, when he claimed that Nick Read had considered leaving his role on several occasions and was unhappy with his pay.\nHe said he went to speak to Mr Hollinrake after a pay request for Mr Read was signed off by the Post Office.\nThe Post Office has said that Mr Read never tendered his resignation.\nMPs were also shocked, however, by the revelation from Mr Staunton that Mr Read was under investigation by the Post Office's human resources department.\nIt came after MPs were told by witnesses earlier in the day that an internal investigation was under way into Mr Staunton over his alleged behaviour while he chaired the company.\n'Sub-postmasters the real priority'\nDuring the hearing in Westminster, campaigner Alan Bates said that the bitter row that has broken out between government, Mr Staunton and the Post Office was a \"distraction\", adding that the government needs to \"get on and pay people\".\nMr Staunton was sacked from his post in January by Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch who cited concerns about Post Office governance and \"the entire business model\".\nThe row deepened when Mr Staunton hit back, saying he had been told to stall compensation payments for sub-postmasters to allow the government to \"hobble into the election\" - a claim that was denied by top civil servant Sarah Munby.\nMs Badenoch also hit back at the claims, saying they were \"completely false\".\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Bates said financial redress for sub-postmasters is \"the real priority\".\nHe slammed the Post Office as a \"toxic organisation\" that \"cannot get its act together\", adding: \"You hear about the bonuses at one end for the senior executives, and then you hear about distress funds for sub-postmasters who aren't generating enough trade to earn a living.\"\nThe former sub-postmaster led the campaign to expose the Post Office Horizon IT scandal, and has criticised the government for taking a long time to deliver compensation to those affected.\nMr Hollinrake said on Wednesday he wanted to pay compensation in \"all cases ideally by the end of this year.\"\nHowever, lawyers acting for sub-postmasters recently said they expected victims to get full and final redress within one to two years.\nLiam Byrne, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: \"What we saw [on Tuesday] is, chaos, frankly, when what we need is a clarity of purpose about getting money out the door.\"\nHe added that \"at best, about 20%\" of a budget of roughly \u00c2\u00a31-1.2bn for compensation for victims of the scandal had been paid out.\nMr Bates has also said that he believes the Post Office should be sold for a token \u00c2\u00a31 to a company such as Amazon.\n\"I've long thought that the Post Office as a business model is dead in the water... it needs huge investment\", as well as support for current sub-postmasters.\nMr Bates continues to campaign for all sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses affected by the Horizon software failure and for fair compensation from the government.\nHis two-decade fight inspired the recent ITV mini-series - Mr Bates vs the Post Office - which told the story of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses who were wrongly prosecuted after a faulty accounting system suggested money was missing from Post Office branches.\nMr Bates founded the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance, and he and five others took the Post Office to the High Court in 2017.\nOn Tuesday, he also questioned the framing of money due to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses under the GLO scheme as \"compensation\" due to the financial and emotional turmoil many have been put through.\n\"It's not - it's financial redress. This is money these people are actually owed and they've been owed it for years.\n",
    "A court in Spain has found former Barcelona and Brazil footballer Dani Alves guilty of raping a woman in a Barcelona nightclub.\nHe has been sentenced to four and a half years in prison.\nThe 40-year-old, who is one of the most decorated footballers in history, had denied sexually assaulting the woman in the early hours of 31 December 2022.\nHis lawyer had asked for his acquittal and said she would appeal against the verdict.\nA lawyer for the victim welcomed the verdict, saying that it \"recognises what we have always known: the truth [as told] by the victim and the suffering there has been\".\nAs well as handing Alves a four-and-a-half year sentence, the court said he should face a further five years' probation.\nThe prosecution had asked for a nine-year prison sentence. In Spain, a claim of rape is investigated under the general accusation of sexual assault, and convictions can lead to prison sentences of four to 15 years.\nAccording to Spanish media, the court took into account Alves's decision to pay the victim \u00e2\u0082\u00ac150,000 (\u00c2\u00a3128,500) in damages regardless of the outcome of the trial when it decided on the length of his prison term.\nThe court did not, however, accept the argument put forward by his lawyers that he should be given a more lenient sentence because he was drunk.\nHis wife Joana Sanz, 31, said he had appeared very drunk when he got back to their Barcelona home the night of the rape and had bumped into furniture before collapsing on the bed.\nBut the court argued that his alcohol consumption had not affected his behaviour.\nProsecutors said Alves and his friend had bought champagne for three young women before Alves lured one of them to a VIP area of the nightclub with a toilet which she had no knowledge of.\nThey argued that it was at this point he turned violent, forcing the woman to have sex despite her repeated requests to leave.\nAlves had maintained she could have left \"if she wanted to\". However, the court found that she did not consent.\nSpanish law was changed recently to enshrine the importance of consent under the so-called \"Only Yes is Yes\" principle.\nIn a statement, the court said there was evidence other than the victim's testimony that proved that she had been raped.\nIt said Alves had \"abruptly grabbed the complainant\" and thrown her to the ground. He had then raped her while preventing her from moving as \"the complainant said no and wanted to leave\", it added.\nThe woman said the rape had caused her \"anguish and terror\", and one of her friends who was with her on the night described how the 23-year-old had cried \"uncontrollably\" after leaving the bathroom.\nAlves has been held in pre-trial detention since January 2023 and has changed his testimony on a number of occasions.\nHe first denied knowing his accuser only to claim later that he had met her in the toilet but that nothing had happened between them.\nHe then changed his version of events again, saying that they had had consensual sex. \"We were both enjoying ourselves,\" he alleged.\nAlves played more than 400 times for Barcelona, winning six league titles and three Champions Leagues across two spells with the club. He was also part of Brazil's 2022 World Cup squad.\nHe has won trophies playing for Sevilla, Juventus and PSG and is among Brazil's most capped internationals, with 126 appearances.",

    "The wreckage of an old wooden ship which was discovered on an Orkney beach is beginning to break up.\nAttempts to rescue the separated pieces began on Sanday on Monday afternoon.\nIt is thought a recent storm released the well-preserved wreck of the vessel - which could date from the 1700s - from beneath the sand.\nEdinburgh-based archaeologists will arrive at the end of the week to record and sample the parts of the ship that have been saved.\nThe wreckage that was discovered had its timbers held together with large wooden pegs in a style understood to have been commonly used as far back as the 16th Century.\nIt is hoped the timber can be preserved and that further investigation will reveal more about the ship.\nRoderick Thorne, from the Sanday Heritage Group, said: \"The wreckage started breaking up the weekend.\"\nHe said that on Monday evening, farmer Raymond Brown, from Colligarth, used his tractor to remove two large sections from the beach.\n\"They'd become detached from the main wreckage, and we are now keeping them wrapped up and damp with brine so they can be analysed by the archaeologists when they arrive in Sanday on Thursday,\" Mr Thorne said.\n\"We have removed one ship's timber around 4m (13ft) long, and two 'futtocks' around 2m (6.5ft) long from the beach. The rest of the structure is still pretty intact on the shore but it's too heavy to attempt to move the whole thing.\"\nOrkney Islands Council received emergency funding from Historic Environment Scotland for an archaeological team from Wessex Archaeology to visit Sanday on Thursday and Friday.\nThey will survey the wreckage and take samples to analyse and date the ship's timbers using dendrochronology. These will provide information about how old the vessel is and where it was built.\nThe archaeologists are also offering to train Sanday residents in how to survey and preserve any future marine wreckage found on the island's extensive sandy shoreline.\nBen Saunders from Wessex Archaeology said they had wanted to first assess the layout of the wreck in case it had been damaged while it was being moved, but the wreckage had shifted down the tideline.\n\"I still don't really think it has been washed up, I think it has been in that bit of the beach for a while and the sediment around it has exposed it,\" he said.\n\"We felt at the time that it was looking like it was going to get reburied, which would have been the best thing for it - it would have kept it safe and preserved it until potentially further work could be done.\"\nHe added: \"It's hit the point where it's obviously starting to break up so it is necessary to get it up the beach at least for now to get the recording done and sampled.\n\"Conserving and preserving this sort of material is very difficult and very expensive so the more suitable option is preservation by record.\"\nRecords include photographs, drawings and getting as much data as possible from a wreck in a short space of time.\nMr Saunders said people on Sanday had done \"fantastic\" work recording details of the wreckage and their photography could be used to recreate a 3D model of the wreckage.\nHis team hopes to take slices out of the timbers to do tree-ring dating and potentially work out where the trees grew.\nSanday author and historian Myra Stockton has catalogued about 200 shipwrecks around the island, dating as far back as 1596.\nShe said records identified 14 ships lost near the beach where the wreckage found and there was local speculation that the latest discovery could be part of the Spanish Armada.",

    "A medicine for severe hair loss, or alopecia, is being recommended on the NHS for the first time.\nThe daily pill, called ritlecitinib or Litfulo, could help up to 14,000 people in England, says the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).\nScotland is currently considering whether to start offering it on the NHS too.\nThe drug, which is licensed to give to people aged 12 and over, helps fight inflammation to improve hair growth.\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks the follicles of the hair, causing it to fall out.\nIn severe cases, hair is lost from across the body. Lack of hair on parts of the body other than the scalp, including eyelashes and eyebrows, nasal hair, and hair on the skin leaves people more vulnerable to infections and reduces their ability to regulate their body temperature.\nLiving with alopecia can be profoundly challenging and cause anxiety and stress. People may experience difficulty at school and in the workplace, and it can lead to social isolation and affect intimate relationships, experts say.\nDawn, who is now in her 30s, has had alopecia since childhood.\nShe told the BBC: \"Dealing with alopecia is very much a rollercoaster of emotions, it's such an unpredictable condition that gives hope as quickly as it can take it away again.\n\"Living with it since I was a child, I always hid my patches, in fear of the judgement of somebody seeing a bald spot. Then, when I lost all my hair on approach to my thirties and could no longer hide it, I very much had to go through a cycle of grief. I was very withdrawn, wanting to avoid doing anything, which led to it having a huge impact on my mental health.\"\nShe says she's now \"in a much better place\" thanks to the support of friends and family and the charity Alopecia UK .\nShe is considering trying the drug.\n\"Despite being in a good place with my hair loss, it gives me an option I didn't have before, for the first time, I can have a little control over such an unpredictable condition that made me feel like I lost who I was.\"\nNICE initially rejected the drug last year but has now reversed its decision following a public consultation, as well as receiving more information about it, including a reduced price from the manufacturer Pfizer.\nWithout a discount, a packet of 30 capsules would normally cost almost \u00c2\u00a31,000.\nHelen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said: \"Our committee heard how severe alopecia areata can have a significant impact on people's health and quality of life.\n\"I'm delighted that we are now able to recommend this innovative treatment.\"\nSue Schilling, chief executive of Alopecia UK, said: \"For far too long, patients with alopecia areata have gone without a licensed treatment option available via NHS pathways.\n\"If new treatments are only available privately, it becomes a case of the 'haves and the have nots', this latest NICE recommendation will go some way to address this.\"\nShe said patients still faced substantial barriers, including difficulties in getting a dermatology referral from their GP, unacceptable dermatology waiting times, and even some NHS trusts making the decision not to allow dermatology appointments for alopecia patients.\n\"There is no longer the excuse of there being no licensed treatment available. I urge key decision-makers within the NHS to keep referral pathways open for patients with alopecia areata,\" she said.",
    "Should we give up parts of the countryside for the sake of the climate and lowering our energy bills?\nThat was the key question at the heart of a planning inquiry into a large solar farm in Warwickshire this week.\nThe project was approved by Warwick District Council last year.\nBut local Conservative MP Sir Jeremy Wright thinks that was the wrong decision, and took the unusual step of asking the government to launch a planning inquiry.\nAn inspector heard the case last week and will now make a recommendation, with the government due to decide the fate of the project later this year.\nThe story here is familiar: an MP backing constituents in their battle against a developer.\nBut what is at stake is part of a much bigger national conversation about climate change, our environment and the future of our energy system.\nIn this debate, Labour has said it wants to back \"the builders not the blockers so Britain gets the cheap, clean power we need\".\nThat's a political slogan that could be put into practice if Labour wins the general election.\nAnd that could mean more planning disputes over where to put solar panels and whether fields in Warwickshire or elsewhere are the best place for them.\nIn a hamlet near Kenilworth in Warwickshire, David Clapp's bed and breakfast is surrounded by open fields as far as the eye can see.\nHe has lived here for decades at the Croft cottage, where the picturesque countryside is a draw for locals and tourists alike.\nBut the 84-year-old, who is also a parish councillor, fears a new neighbour could disrupt his way of life.\n\"If this goes ahead, it will be a catastrophe,\" said Mr Clapp. \"It will be a deluge of planning applications.\"\nFears for green belt\nHe is referring to a solar farm proposed by Enso Energy, which wants to mount hundreds of solar panels to the ground in a field across the road from his cottage.\nIf built, the solar farm would cover an area equivalent to about 80 football pitches, and generate enough renewable energy to power 6,000 homes a year.\n\"In a nutshell, it will turn the green belt into a black belt,\" Mr Clapp said.\nBut Enso Energy doesn't agree.\nAt the planning inquiry last week, the company argued the solar farm would have \"limited\" effects on the landscape, and operate for 40 years, leaving a \"light footprint\".\n\"In all, the impacts on the green belt are remarkably limited,\" the company argued.\nIt also said there would be a biodiversity net gain of 131%, and the site would be used for sheep grazing, and be hidden behind hedges.\nThe key test in this planning inquiry is whether \"very special circumstances\" outweigh the potential harm to the green belt.\nInitially, Warwick District Council's planning committee approved the solar farm in July, despite planning officers recommending refusal.\nThe committee agreed that the need to reach climate targets and increase the country's energy security amounted to \"very special circumstances\".\nSir Jeremy Wright - the MP for Kenilworth and Southam - feels this could set a \"dangerous precedent\".\n\"I agree renewable energy is a good thing but that doesn't mean that's appropriate to put that kind of infrastructure anywhere,\" he said. \"It's also important to defend the green belt.\"\nIf the green belt is eroded \"we will end up with a worse environment, not a better one\", he added.\nSir Jeremy is supporting a local parish council, which has said it has used much of its reserve funds to oppose the solar farm.\nSolar power is a key part of the government's energy strategy, with plans to develop 70GW of it by 2035.\nSir Keir Starmer's party is upping the ante, saying it wants more than triple solar power to 50 GW by 2030.\nOne local Labour councillor believes that's the right ambition.\n\"We want solar panels to be everywhere,\" said Chris King, the portfolio holder for planning policy on Warwick District Council.\nHe accuses David Cameron's government of scrapping plans to \"decrease the carbon footprint of our buildings\".\n\"We're left with these huge targets to become carbon neutral in not many years\", said Mr King, \"so we need to put solar panels where we can.\"\nMuch more clean power is needed to meet the country's climate target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nFor many local residents here and in other rural parts of the country, swapping the green belt for green energy is not the solution.\nLast year, the government changed planning rules to enable homes and businesses to install rooftop solar panels more easily.\nThe government said it was \"clear that where possible already developed land should be used for solar panels\".\nBut what if that isn't possible? That's where a political dividing line can be drawn between - as Labour has framed it - the builders and the blockers.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

    "Two Canadian universities are suing the province of Quebec over a plan to hike tuition fees by 33% for out-of-province students and changes to fees paid by international students.\nMcGill and Concordia, two English-language universities in Quebec, argue the measures are discriminatory.\nApplications for both have dropped since the measures were announced.\nQuebec has defended the plan, claiming that it will help preserve the French language.\nIn December, the predominantly French-speaking province said tuition for out-of-province students would increase from C$9,000 ($6,700; \u00c2\u00a35,200) to C$12,000 a year.\nQuebec will also take a larger chunk of the universities' international student fees, which once boosted the schools' operating budgets. Those funds are to be redistributed to French-speaking universities.\nThe province will also require that 80% of students from outside Quebec reach an intermediate level of French by the time they graduate.\nThe tuition overhaul is part of a range of policies Quebec has adopted to help preserve French heritage and language in the province - a longtime goal.\nBut both McGill and Concordia, two of the three English-language universities in the province, announced separate legal challenges on Friday on the basis of discrimination. They declared they had exhausted all other avenues.\n\"We would have greatly preferred not to do this, but we have run out of viable alternatives,\" Deep Saini, McGill's vice-chancellor and president, said in a statement.\nHe added that the university's board believes the \"measures are illegal\" and \"threaten\" the institution's mission.\nMcGill University is seeking a stay on both the tuition hike and the changes to their funding model. It says they constitute discrimination under federal and provincial rights charters and are \"an unreasonable exercise of the powers\" by the higher education minister.\nConcordia is seeking a judicial review of the tuition measures, saying in its court filing that they are \"based on stereotypes and false assumptions about the English-speaking community of Quebec and its institutions\".\nThe schools also argue the changes are already negatively affecting their future enrollment.\nCombined, out-of province and international undergraduate applications for McGill have dropped by more than 25% since last year. Concordia has had a roughly 39% combined decline in both types of applications over the same period.\nA spokesman for Quebec's higher education minister, Pascale D\u00c3\u00a9ry, declined to comment as the matter is now before the courts.",
    "Sadiq Khan has called for a further clamp-down on property owned by Russians linked to Vladimir Putin.\nIn a letter to the Housing Secretary Michael Gove, the London mayor wrote ministers should \"urgently act\" to sell property of \"Putin's cronies\" and use the proceeds to help those in need.\nCity Hall suggested 4,000 homes could be built with the proceeds from selling Kremlin-linked property in the capital.\nThe government said it has sanctioned 1,700 people and entities.\nMr Khan's intervention comes a day after the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nHe called on ministers to \"urgently act to seize property which has been bought by Putin's cronies, so we can use the proceeds of this for the benefit of those in need\".\nAccording to new analysis by City Hall, if the \u00c2\u00a31.1bn of property identified by Transparency International in 2022 as being bought by Russians accused of corruption or with links to the Kremlin could be sold, it would provide sufficient funding for over 4,000 low-cost homes.\n\"This could include providing affordable accommodation for some of those Ukrainians who have made London their home after fleeing Ukraine following Putin's invasion,\" the mayor said.\nAcknowledging the government has established a register of overseas entities who buy or sell property in the UK, Mr Khan said he remained concerned financial trusts can still be used to mask property ownership.\nA spokesperson for the government said it had introduced the largest and most severe package of sanctions ever imposed on a major economy.\n\"We want to do all we can to ensure those with links to Putin's regime cannot benefit from the UK property market, which is why we are taking action to clean up the sector,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"This includes a consultation on increasing the transparency of property-owning trusts, shining a light on who truly owns our property. We are considering all responses and will respond as soon as possible.\"\nMr Khan also told Mr Gove he was \"alarmed to see the government's announcement on the closure of the Ukraine Family Scheme\", arguing that \"Ukrainians still going through unimaginable horror in their home country should be able to join family members already taking sanctuary in the UK\".\nHowever, earlier this week the Home Office clarified: \"Ukrainian nationals who would have qualified under the Ukraine family scheme will still be able to apply to Homes for Ukraine.\n\"Family members who are settled here can also still continue to sponsor a family member to come to the UK under Homes for Ukraine.\"\nOn Saturday hundreds of people marched in London to mark the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

We did give them the cars' registrations when I made the initial report.\n\"Yet somehow these people have turned up nearly two weeks later in the same cars and done the same thing.\"\nHe described the incidents as \"more organised crime than it is shoplifting\" and said he believed the group had been involved in three other bulk thefts since 2021.\nBut instances of low-value shoplifting at Tates have increased in the same timeframe, said Mr Tate, who added \"label swapping\" - where more expensive price labels are swapped for cheaper ones - had become commonplace.\nIt comes as the latest crime figures for regional forces in England and Wales showed Sussex Police had experienced the biggest year-on-year increase in recorded shoplifting offences in the year ending September 2023, at 69%.\n\"It's difficult for us as a business because we're trying to give customers a good price and pay people good [wages],\" added Mr Tate.\nAlongside the losses, Tates said it had invested \"tens of thousands\" of pounds on a new team of security guards and new CCTV cameras to try to curb the issue.\nSussex Police said it had received reports of an \"ongoing series\" of shopliftings at the garden centres.\nIt said the information had been recorded and its business crime team was \"thoroughly investigating\" both incidents.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "South Korea's government  is threatening to take legal action against  thousands of striking junior doctors and revoke their medical licences if they do not return to work on Thursday.\nAround three quarters of the country's junior doctors have walked out of their jobs over the past week, causing disruption and delays to surgeries at major teaching hospitals.\nThe trainee doctors are protesting government plans to admit drastically more medical students to university each year, to increase the number of doctors in the system.\nSouth Korea has one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios among developed countries, and with a rapidly aging population, the government is warning there will be an acute shortage within a decade.\nThe empty corridors of St Mary's Hospital in Seoul this week gave a glimpse of what that future might look like. There was barely a doctor or patient to be seen in the triage area outside the emergency room, with patients warned to stay away.\nRyu Ok Hada, a 25-year-old doctor, and his colleagues have not been to work at the hospital for over a week.\n\"It feels weird not getting up at 4 a.m.,\" Ryu joked. The junior doctor told the BBC he was used to working more than 100 hours a week, often for 40 hours without sleep. \"It's insane how much we work for such little pay\".\nAlthough doctors' salaries in South Korea are relatively high, Ryu argues that given their hours, he and other junior doctors can end up earning less than the minimum wage. More doctors will not fix the structural issues within the healthcare system, that leave them overworked and underpaid, he says.\nHealthcare in South Korea is largely privatised but affordable. The prices of emergency, life-saving surgeries and specialist care have been set too low, the doctors say, while less essential treatments, like cosmetic surgeries, pay too much. This means doctors are increasingly opting to work in more lucrative fields in the big cities, leaving rural areas understaffed and emergency rooms overstretched.\nRyu, who has been working for a year, says trainee and junior doctors are being exploited by the university hospitals for their cheap labour. In some of the larger hospitals, they make up more than 40% of the staff, providing a critical role in keeping them running.\nAs a result, surgery capacity at some hospitals has halved over the past week. The disruption has been mostly limited to planned procedures, which have been postponed, with only a few isolated instances of critical care being affected. Last Friday, an elderly woman suffering a cardiac arrest died in an ambulance after seven hospitals reportedly refused to treat her.\nThe government has said the patient in question had terminal cancer and her death was unrelated to the walkout.\n'There are no doctors'\nPatience with the doctors is running out from both the public and the healthcare workers needing to pick up the extra work. Nurses have warned they are being forced to carry out procedures in operating theatres that would normally fall to their doctor colleagues.\nMs Choi, a nurse at a hospital in Incheon, told the BBC her shifts had been extended by an hour and a half each day and she was now doing the work of two people.\n\"The patients are anxious, and I am frustrated that this is continuing without an end in sight,\" she said, urging the doctors to come back to work and find another way to demonstrate their grievances.\nUnder the government's proposals, the number of medical students admitted to university next year would rise from 3,000 to 5,000. The striking doctors argue that training more physicians would dilute the quality of care, because it would mean giving medical licenses to less competent practitioners.\nBut the doctors are struggling to convince the public that more doctors would be a bad thing and have garnered little sympathy. At Seoul's Severance Hospital on Tuesday, 74-year-old Mrs Lee was receiving treatment for colon cancer, having travelled for over an hour to get there.\n\"Outside the city, where we live, there are no doctors,\" she said.\n\"This problem has been kicked down the road for too long and needs to be fixed,\" said Lee's husband Soon-dong. \"The doctors are being too selfish. They're taking us patients hostage\".\nThe couple was worried about more doctors joining the strike, and said they would be happy to pay more for their care, if it meant the dispute would be resolved.\nBut President Yoon Suk Yeol's approval rating has improved since the walkout began, meaning the government has little incentive to start overhauling the system and making procedures more expensive, just ahead of elections in April.\nBoth sides are now locked in an intense standoff. The health ministry has refused to accept the doctors' resignations and is instead threatening to prosecute them for breaking medical law if they do not return to the hospitals by the end of the day.\nThe vice-health minister Park Min-soo has said those who miss the deadline will also have their licences suspended fo",
    "Lancaster residents said they hope a derelict theme park could become a must-visit destination again.\nFrontierland opened in Morecambe in the 1980s, after beginning life as a fairground in 1906, but closed in 1999.\nLancaster City Council bought the site in 2021 and invited interested parties to submit plans for it.\nIt said it hopes a developer will come forward with an \"exciting idea\" and that work can begin to transform the park within the next 18 months.\nLancaster City Councillor Joanne Ainscough said the site could be a fairground again, but only if the idea for the park was good.\n\"We've just done the public consultation and the majority of people want a site that is a leisure site,\" she said.\n\"We have done an expression of interest and the majority of developers came forward with hotels and housing, and that's not really the inspiration we want. We want something that's more exciting.\n\"If somebody came along with a really brilliant idea for a fairground, why not? But it has to be something that gives the council some money back on its investment but also gives something for both visitors and locals.\n\"The council does not want this to be sat around for another five, 10 years. The people of Morecambe have had to put up with this white elephant for a very long time. We want it to be done as quickly as possible.\n\"I'd hope to see that within 12, 18 months we've got something building on site, whether we can achieve that is a different matter.\"\nRita's Cafe has been running on the seafront for nearly 40 years and saw Frontierland come and go.\nOwner Lynn Turner said she hoped the council would rebuild Frontierland on the site, to attract more families to the town.\n\"The amount of families that say how much they miss it, there's nothing else for them really,\" she said.\n\"I used to take my children there many years ago and it was a meeting point for people. It's a shame really.\n\"I think the council would get their money back if they went back to Frontierland.\n\"It's for Morecambe, it's to bring people back to Morecambe with families,\" she said.\n\"They come into Morecambe and they've just got arcades where they spend an absolute fortune. And it's not really good for the kids just going on the machines.\n\"A lot of businesses have closed down so I think it would do a lot.\n\"It's really gone down hill Morecambe, it's a shame because it's a beautiful place.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Campaigners have said their \"fight is not over\" after a plan for a solar farm near Horncastle was quashed.\nPush Energy's proposals for land adjacent to Sotby Woods on Sturton Road, in Hatton, were approved by East Lindsey District Council last year.\nBut people living in the area fiercely opposed it and, following a judicial review, a High Court judge said the council's approval was \"unlawful\".\nThe council said the application would go back before the planning committee.\nCouncillor Ruchira Yarsley, from the Hatton Action Group, said while campaigners were \"overjoyed\" that the developer's plans for a 49.99MW farm on agricultural land had been thrown out, they were still \"determined to continue the fight for as long as required\".\n\"Our little community has come together to stand up to the big guy - we're small, but we are mighty,\" she said.\n\"We won the battle but the war is still to be fought, and we're gearing up for that.\"\nShe said campaigners were under no illusion developers would \"rework their application\".\n\"It will come back, the council will rework it. I'm absolutely positive they will come back with another recommendation for approval.\"\nIn the High Court's judgement delivered on 8 February, the deputy judge, Mr Ockelton, said the authority accepted its decision to approve the scheme was \"unlawful as it failed to have sufficient regard to material considerations\" for the development being proposed on \"best and most versatile agricultural land\".\nUnder their proposals, the developer wanted the farm to produce enough energy to power 21,000 homes a year, for about 40 years.\nPush Energy had previously said their plant would help meet net-zero-carbon-emissions targets and enhance biodiversity.\nHowever, dozens objected to the proposed scheme with parish councils lodging concerns around the loss of agricultural land, the impact on the landscape and transport infrastructure.\nCouncillor Tom Ashton, portfolio holder for planning at East Lindsey District Council, said the authority had \"received formal confirmation from the courts that the original planning decision has been nullified\".\n\"We are now in dialogue with the applicants and anticipate the delivery of updated information before the council will move to re-determine the application,\" he said.\n\"The application will go back to the Planning Committee for fresh consideration in due course, although a timescale for this has not yet been established.\"\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram .

    "A former British champion motorcyclist who robbed betting shops and service stations, escaping with \u00c2\u00a3100,000, has been jailed for eight years.\nDavid Shoubridge won the Ducati Performance TriOptions Cup Championship at Brands Hatch in October 2022, but began committing crimes a month later.\nSt Albans Crown Court heard he was \"a lost soul battling gambling debts\".\nThe 35-year-old of Downsfield, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, pleaded guilty to numerous offences including robbery.\nHe also admitted attempted robbery, possession of a firearm and of an imitation firearm, theft, going equipped for theft and attempted theft.\nThe offences occurred between November 2022 and July 2023.\nThe court heard he began committing crimes at bookmakers in Hatfield and Potters Bar, and the Welcome Break service station at South Mimms.\nProsecution barrister Philip Mizner said Shoubridge wore black clothing and a balaclava or motorbike helmet, and wielded what appeared to be a handgun when targeting premises.\nOn several occasions he used an angle grinder and crowbar to break into cash payout machines.\nAt one robbery he left his DNA on a magazine belonging to a BB pistol, which allowed police to link him to the offence.\nShoubridge was caught at the scene of an attempted robbery and apprehended using a Taser, but he gave false details and refused to answer questions at interview.\nHe later claimed he had been using cocaine.\n'Changed my life completely'\nGoing through the offences, Mr Mizner said on one occasion Shoubridge pointed the gun at a female employee, shouting: \"Where's the money, money, money, money?\"\nOne of his victims, a 20-year-old student working in a bookmakers to raise money for her education, said after the robbery: \"I felt genuine terror, fell to the floor crying and screaming, while this man stood above me pointing the gun down at me.\n\"For the first time in 10 years I had to sleep in bed with my mum. I couldn't understand how someone could do something like this to another person.\"\nShe suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, quit her job and had to defer her university place.\nShe added that she no longer went out with friends, as the robbery had \"changed my life completely\".\nMitigating, defence barrister Dan Taylor said there was nothing he could say that could diminish the impact of Shoubridge's actions, but said the offences were not professional and often amateurish.\n\"Until he fell into the drug and gambling habits which are the cause of this offending, he led a successful career as a British motorbike champion,\" he said.\nShoubridge said in a statement his offending was completely out of character and weighed heavily on his heart.\n\"I truly hope one day in the future my victims can understand I'm not a career criminal but a lost soul battling gambling debts, leading to the biggest mistakes of my life,\" he said.\nJudge Michael Roques said: \"It is an extraordinary list of offences for someone who has never been before the court before\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I cannot describe this as an aberration or a one-off moment of madness on your behalf.\n\"To live in fear is a terrible consequence for anybody and it seems to be an entirely predictable consequence of the way you chose to act.\"\nThe defendant, who wore a dark blue suit, was supported by 13 friends and family in the gallery and broke into tears when his sentence was passed.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "South Korea's government has launched an investigation into the death of a woman in her 80s after her ambulance was denied entry to several hospitals due to the ongoing doctors strike.\nThe patient died in the ambulance after suffering cardiac arrest.\nAbout 70% of junior doctors have been on strike for the past week protesting plans to train up more physicians.\nThat's put emergency rooms under pressure, with the government alleging doctors have risked public health.\nParamedics in the city of Daejon on Friday had called around seven hospitals to take the woman, but were turned away due to a lack of staffing and beds.\nShe was eventually admitted to a public university hospital 67 minutes after she first called for help, but was pronounced dead on arrival.\nOn Tuesday, government officials said they would investigate the case, which has been widely reported in South Korean media.\nIt is believed to be the first death linked to the doctor strikes, where interns and residents are protesting government plans to add more doctors due to competition fears.\nEmergency rooms have been under significant pressure with low staffing levels. Surgeries have been postponed and patients have had to be transferred to other hospitals, local media report.\nMore than 9,000 doctors have refused to come into work, while about 10,000 have submitted resignations at hundreds of hospitals across the country.\nInterns and residents make up rank and file staffing in emergency wards so their absence has been widely felt, with hospitals having to operate on contingency settings, officials say. The country last week put the healthcare system at the highest crisis level.\nThe protests have escalated into a tense political stand-off, with officials threatening legal action.\nOn Tuesday, the government threatened to execute statutory powers to strip doctors of their practicing licences if they didn't return by the end of the month.\nPresident Yoon Suk-yeol has refused doctor demands to scrap his policy of increasing the number of graduates by 60%, saying the country needs to address its shortage of physicians as it faces the challenges of a rapidly ageing population.\nSouth Korea has one of the lowest doctor-per-patient ratios among the group of OECD countries - only 2.5 per 1,000 people - and significant shortages in critical practices such as obstetrics and paediatrics.\nSuccessive governments have tried to open up medical school placements - but have consistently come up against stiff opposition from doctor groups.\nPublic health experts say that doctors are acting out of their own commercial interests.\nAs South Korea's healthcare system is highly privatised - with more than 90% of hospitals fee-paying - the medical profession is reluctant to open up to more competition and potential losses in income.\n\"But there's no way South Korean people should endure inconveniences just to fulfil the doctors' interest,\" Prof Jeong Hyoung-sun, a professor of health administration at Yonsei University said.",
    "Nigeria is currently experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation, leading to widespread hardship and anger.\nThe trade union umbrella group, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), held protests in the main cities on Tuesday, calling for more action from the government.\nA litre of petrol costs more than three times what it did nine months ago, while the price of the staple food, rice, has more than doubled in the past year.\nThese two figures highlight the difficulties that many Nigerians are facing as wages have not kept up with the rising cost of living.\nLike many nations, Nigeria has experienced economic shocks from beyond its shores in recent years, but there are also issues specific to the country, partly driven by the reforms introduced by President Bola Tinubu when he took office last May.\nHow bad is the economy?\nOverall, annual inflation, which is the average rate at which prices go up, is now close to 30% - the highest figure in nearly three decades. The cost of food has risen even more - by 35%.\nHowever, the monthly minimum wage, set by the government and which all employers are supposed to observe, has not changed since 2019, when it was put at 30,000 naira - this is worth just $19 (\u00c2\u00a315) at current exchange rates.\nMany are going hungry, rationing what food they have or looking for cheaper alternatives.\nIn the north, some people are now eating the rice that is normally discarded as part of the milling process. The waste product usually goes into fish food.\nWidely shared social media videos indicate how some are reducing portion sizes.\nOne clip shows a woman cutting a fish into nine pieces rather than the average four to five. She is heard saying her goal is to ensure her family can at least eat some fish twice a week.\nWhat is causing Nigeria's economic crisis?\nInflation has soared in many countries, as fuel and other costs spiked as a result of the war in Ukraine.\nBut President Tinubu's efforts to remodel the economy have also added to the burden.\nOn the day he was sworn in nine months ago, the new president announced that the long-standing fuel subsidy would be ending.\nThis had kept petrol prices low for citizens of this oil-producing nation, but it was also a huge drain on public finances. In the first half of 2023, it accounted for 15% of the budget - more than the government spent on health or education. Mr Tinubu argued that this could be better used elsewhere.\nHowever, the subsequent huge jump in the price of petrol has caused other prices to rise as companies pass on transportation and energy costs to the consumer.\nOne other factor that is pushing up inflation is an issue that Mr Tinubu inherited from his predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari, according to financial analyst Tilewa Adebajo.\nHe told the BBC's Newsday programme that the previous government had asked the country's central bank for short-term loans to cover spending amounting to $19bn.\nThe bank printed the money, which helped fuel inflation, Mr Adebajo said.\nWhat has happened to the naira?\nMr Tinubu also ended the policy of pegging the price of the currency, the naira, to the US dollar rather than leaving it up to the market to determine on the basis of supply and demand. The central bank was spending a lot of money maintaining the level.\nBut scrapping the peg has led the naira's value to plunge by more than two-thirds, briefly hitting an all-time low last week.\nLast May, 10,000 naira would buy $22, now it will only fetch around $6.40.\nAs the naira is worth less, the price of all imported products has gone up.\nWhen will things get better?\nWhile the president is unlikely to reverse his decisions on the fuel subsidy and the naira, which he argues will pay off in the long run by making Nigeria's economy stronger, the government has introduced some measures to ease the suffering.\nNigeria's Vice-President Kashim Shettima announced the establishment of a board charged with controlling and regulating food prices. The government also ordered the national grain reserve to distribute 42,000 tonnes of grains, including maize and millet.\nThis is not the first time the government has said it is distributing aid to poor and vulnerable Nigerians, but labour unions have often criticised the government's method of food distribution, saying much of it does not reach poor families.\nThe government has also said it is working with rice producers to get more of it into markets and customs officials have been instructed to cheaply sell off bags of the grain that they have seized. In a sign of how bad things are, on Friday this led to a crush in the biggest city, Lagos, which killed seven people, local media report. These hand-outs have now been halted.\nThe rice was seized under the previous government, which banned imports of rice to encourage local farmers to grow more. That ban was lifted last year in at attempt to bring down the cost but because of the fall in the value of the naira, that has not worked.\nAround 15 million poorer households are also re",

    "Maj Oleh Kravchenko has the sort of chuckle that's hard to resist - deep and treacly and mischievous.\n\"I'm still alive,\" he said, tilting his head to one side in his wheelchair, like a spectator marvelling at someone else's magic trick.\nAs Ukraine marks the second anniversary of the war, Kravchenko's turbulent story captures something of the journey so many people here - soldiers and civilians alike - have been on, as they've come to understand the sort of sacrifices and patience this long conflict is demanding of them.\nKravchenko is 50 years old now, and we're meeting for the third time since Russia launched its latest invasion of Ukraine. His beard - brown and trim when I first encountered him in the besieged Donbas town of Lysychansk in 2022 - is now straggly and grey.\nWe first met on a warm day in Lysychansk, in April 2022, having driven into the hilltop town on the last road still more or less under Ukrainian control. Kravchenko emerged from a doorway with a wry smile and offered to drive us around.\nWe raced off towards the frontlines in his car at furious speed, an automatic rifle at his side, and the sound of incoming artillery fire booming through the open windows.\n\"Look here. It's a crater from a Russian bomb,\" he said, playing the tour guide, as we skidded round another corner.\nKravchenko, in charge of the 57th Brigade's medical teams, took us to an evacuation point in the bombed-out ruins of an old factory, and then helped us sneak, without permission, past far more cautious officials, and into the main military hospital, where dozens of shell-shocked Ukrainian soldiers lay silently in their beds.\n\"A practical guy - unorthodox,\" one of his colleagues remarked about Kravchenko's style, with an indulgent smile.\nKravchenko had already seen plenty of war before the Russian invasion. After leaving his job administering a hospital in central Ukraine, he'd worked as a doctor for the United Nations, spending several years in Afghanistan, and visiting Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan too.\nBut nothing had prepared him for the opening months of this conflict.\n\"Everywhere, blood, blood, blood,\" he said, as we stood beside a stack of blood-stained stretchers.\nBut in those early days he still seemed optimistic, convinced Ukraine could quickly win the war.\n\"Ukrainian soldiers are strong because it's our land. It's my country. My daughter, my son, are here. My heart is here,\" he said, his back straightening.\n\"I hope one, maybe one and a half months and we will shoot every Russian. Our soldiers will hold their positions. We will give the enemy a good fight.\"\nWe said our goodbyes and drove out of Lysychansk later that afternoon. The town was captured by Russian forces a few weeks later and remains in the Kremlin's control.\nIt would be a whole year before we ran into Kravchenko again, this time on the outskirts of Bakhmut, another frontline town, 50km (31 miles) to the southwest.\n\"Still alive,\" he said, by way of a greeting. It was something I'd begun hearing other soldiers say.\nBut his grin seemed forced. And the dark smudges of exhaustion below Kravchenko's eyes made him look like he was wearing stage paint.\n\"It's been difficult. I didn't sleep at all last night,\" he said, showing me around the small warehouse which his team had turned into a makeshift field hospital.\n'I don't know about my fate'\nIt was the day before Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Russia's Wagner group, launched his short-lived mutiny against President Vladimir Putin in July 2023.\nBakhmut itself had already fallen to the Russians weeks earlier, but Ukraine's much-heralded counter-offensive was in its early stage and there were strong hopes for its success.\nEven so, the signs around Bakhmut were already looking ominous, with casualties from shrapnel and landmines being brought in with alarming regularity from the nearby trenches.\n\"So much heavy artillery,\" Kravchenko remarked.\nAs we sat outside, hiding beneath some trees to avoid Russian drones circling overhead, two incoming shells sent us diving for cover. The second failed to explode and Kravchenko dismissed it, with a short laugh, as a mere \"fart.\"\nBut there was no disguising his unease.\n\"People are very tired. It's been a very heavy year,\" he said.\nThen, unprompted, Kravchenko started to talk about his own future, a subject that must gnaw at so many minds after months spent in constant danger.\n\"I think about God and about fate. My fate is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 hmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I don't know,\" he said, explaining that he sometimes pictured himself after the war was over.\n\"[Until then] I'm just living and doing my job. I want to do it perfectly. I don't know about my fate.\"\nKravchenko was proud of how much experience his unit in the 57th Brigade had gained in combat medicine and talked about sharing that knowledge with other armies. His phone was full of videos showing recent operations he'd performed on soldiers with flesh torn apart by a range of missiles.\nBut then everything changed.\nLate one evenin",

    "Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will deliver his 2024 spring Budget on Wednesday 6 March.\nThere has been a lot of speculation about whether he will announce tax cuts ahead of the next general election.\nWhat is the Budget?\nEach year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement in the House of Commons.\nThis outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes and sets out its spending commitments for health, schools, police and other public services.\nThe Treasury publishes a report alongside the Budget, which sets out further details about the measures and what they will cost.\nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - also assesses the plans.\nThe Labour Leader of the Opposition, Keir Starmer, will respond to the Budget as soon as Mr Hunt sits down.\nMPs will then debate the contents, before the government introduces a Finance Bill to turn the Budget proposals into law.\nWhen is the 2024 Budget?\nThe 2024 spring Budget will take place on Wednesday, 6 March.\nThe chancellor's speech usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour.\nIt will be broadcast live on the BBC iPlayer and the BBC news website.\nThis will be the last Budget before the general election, which must be by the end of January .\nHow is the UK economy doing?\nThe UK economy went into recession at the end of 2023 , after shrinking for two three-month periods in a row.\nThe recession is not expected to last long. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told MPs it may already be over .\nBut even if the economy grows in the first three months of 2024, many households are still struggling financially, after two years of rising prices .\nWhat could be in the 2024 spring Budget?\nIncome taxes\nThe government has hinted that it wants to cut taxes. But it has also suggested there may not be enough money to make big changes.\nCutting the main rate of income tax by 1p would cost \u00c2\u00a37bn, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank.\nAlternatively, the government could spend a similar amount cancelling the current freeze on the amount of money people can earn before they start paying tax or qualify for higher rates.\nAllowing the tax thresholds to rise in line with inflation again would mean millions paying less tax.\nIn January, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned the UK not to cut taxes .\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank also said the government should not cut taxes without spelling out how it would afford them .\nNational Insurance\nThe BBC understands that the government is considering a further cut to National Insurance (NI).\nIn the 2023 Autumn Statement, the chancellor announced an NI cut for 27 million workers which took effect in January . Self-employed NI rates will drop in April.\nA further 1% NI cut would cost \u00c2\u00a34.5bn per year.\n99% mortgages\nAccording to reports in the Financial Times , the chancellor may introduce 99% mortgages.\nThis could make it easier for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder, as they would need only a 1% deposit.\nBut critics have warned such a scheme could put borrowers at risk of negative equity, if falling house prices meant they owed more than the value of their property.\nAnd other experts have pointed out it would not address the need to build more homes across the UK.\nVaping\nA UK-wide ban on disposable vapes has already been announced.\nThe government is also considering a new tax on vapes .\nVaping products are subject to value added tax (VAT) - but unlike tobacco, do not currently also attract a separate levy.\nFuel duty\nFuel duty has been frozen since 2011, so a change could be unpopular.\nBut a 5p fuel duty increase has been pencilled in for later in March.\nThe Resolution Foundation calculates scrapping it would cost \u00c2\u00a32bn in 2024-2025.\nInheritance tax\nA cut in inheritance tax (IHT) would benefit better-off families.\nTypically, only 4% of estates are subject to IHT, about 27,000 a year .\nNevertheless, the chancellor may look at changing that threshold to reflect rising house prices.\nAbolishing it altogether would cost \u00c2\u00a37bn, according to the IFS.\nChildcare\nThe government has already announced an expansion of free childcare places in England, beginning in April .\nBut in January, the chancellor acknowledged the current child-benefit rules may be unfair.\nCurrently, claimants who earn more than \u00c2\u00a350,000 lose some of their family's child benefit - but a family where two parents collectively earn more than \u00c2\u00a350,000 receives the full amount.\nThe chancellor may decide to raise the threshold at which this applies.\nHoliday lets\nThe government is already clamping down on holiday lets .\nAnd it may detail new controls in England designed to prevent local people being priced out of the housing market.\nOwners may need council permission to turn their home into a short-term let.\nDoes the Budget affect all parts of the UK?\nSome parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whol",

Her lawyer denied all the allegations at the time.\nMr Delon's last major public appearance was to receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2019.\nIn September 2019, he attended the funeral of his friend and fellow star Jean-Paul Belmondo in Paris.",

    "The government has been told that new regulations on keeping primates as pets in England falls short of a full ban.\nThe new rules make it illegal to keep monkeys, lemurs, and other primates without a license from April 2026.\nCritics argued that this is not an outright ban on keeping primates as pets, as promised in the Conservative party's 2019 manifesto.\nA minister said the claims that the regulations do not ban keeping primates as pets are \"essentially incorrect\".\nThe legislation, which was passed by peers on Tuesday, means that private owners of primates - such as chimpanzees, orangutans and baboons - will need to be checked by local authorities to make sure they have the right arrangements in place to properly care for the animals.\nAnyone who owns a primate without the appropriate licence could face six months in jail, an unlimited fine, or both.\nSeveral members of the House of Lords raised specific concerns with the legislation.\nLabour frontbencher Baroness Hayman of Ullock said it was \"disappointing that the regulations don't ban the keeping of primates as pets\".\nFormer RSPCA chair and Conservative peer Baroness Fookes said that she would have liked to have seen a \"straight ban on the keeping of primates by private owners\", adding that it was \"impossible\" for most private owners to provide the \"kind of natural setting that is suitable for animals of this kind\".\nLord Douglas-Miller, a minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, disagreed, and called claims that the regulations do not ban keeping the animals as pets \"essentially incorrect\".\nHe added that the vast majority of animals kept as pets do not need to comply with the kinds of requirements in the new legislation.\n\"This is not semantics\", Lord Douglas-Miller said.\n\"Primates have particular welfare needs that cannot be met by keeping them as a household pet and this legislation seeks to end this practice.\"\nHe added that those people who have primates in \"bird cages and other wholly inappropriate conditions\" will no longer be allowed to do so.\nAnimal charity the Humane Society International said the new legislation \"should drastically reduce the number of pet primates over time\", but added that it was \"disappointed [...] that the new licensing scheme falls short of the ban promised by the Conservative party in its manifesto\".",

    "Deep below the River Clyde lies a once bustling thoroughfare that only a select few are now allowed to enter.\nTwo circular rotunda buildings, one of them in the shadow of Glasgow's famous Finnieston Crane, mark the exit and entry points for a long-abandoned Victorian tunnel.\nIt was in the 1890s that the Glasgow Harbour Tunnel Company began its excavations, promising a new means of crossing the river.\nThe city was in the grip of tunnelling mania at the time, as workers carved out the subway system and a \"low level\" underground platform at Central Station.\nThe Harbour Tunnel Company built not just one but three parallel tunnels at the site between Finnieston and Mavisbank Quay.\nTwo were for horse-drawn vehicles using a one-way system, and a third, a little closer to the surface, was reserved for pedestrians.\nA New York firm supplied six hydraulic cage lifts that would lower the horses and carts down a 24m (78ft) shaft before they clattered their way through a 5m (16ft) wide passageway.\n\"The horses generally have taken most kindly to the lifts, and are carried up and down without trouble,\" reported the Otis Elevator Company when the tunnels opened in 1895.\nPedestrians took less kindly to the experience. Access for them was via a long wooden staircase and the foot tunnel gained a reputation for being slightly leaky.\nBy the 1930s the pedestrians were instead sharing the vehicular tunnels - which were now being used by \"motors\" as well.\nA columnist to the Evening Citizen described his descent in the elevators in 1932.\n\"Choosing the company of a horse and lorry as preferable to that of a motor-car, I soon found myself smoothly and quietly descending among a bewildering medley of wheels and cables, through which I could see the mouth of the old disused foot-passenger tunnel as we passed on the way down,\" he wrote.\n\"At the bottom water oozed through the iron sides of the great tube, which has never been totally watertight. At one place a single stalactite a foot long hung from the roof.\"\nThe tunnels were never the financial success the tunnel company hoped for, with bridges and \"horse ferries\" proving a more popular means of crossing the river. The city authorities began subsidising them during World War One, and took them over completely in 1926.\nDuring World War Two they were back in use as a safe passage for dockers and shipyard workers, but in 1943 city officials, fearful of the rising upkeep costs, ordered the removal of the lift equipment. The metal was said to be needed for the war effort.\nThe pedestrian tunnel reopened in 1947 and remained in use until 1980, when it was finally closed to the public. It had been a handy route for fans heading to Ibrox, but in 1988 the Bell's Bridge footbridge would offer a fresh air alternative.\nBy now the two vehicle tunnels had been filled in, and the foot passageway might have faced a similar fate had it not been for the very substance it was built to traverse.\nSince 1938 it has provided a convenient route for a water main, still maintained by Scottish Water, who regularly send down inspectors.\nFor Glaswegians who still remember using the tunnel, it is often a childhood memory of a creepy passageway with alarming drips coming down the tiled sides.\nColin Duncan was a teenager when he used it to nip into the city centre from the south side, and he has fonder memories.\n\"I loved it, and stories of it being rat-infested and scary are just not true. It was well-lit and sort of almost warm,\" he recalled.\nBut he had his doubts about the staircase.  \"If only anyone looked over the wooden steps wall, they would have crept back up them.\n\"The stairs seemed suspended from nowhere, and it was quite a drop into the dark.\"\nThe domed rotundas are now listed buildings which have seen a variety of uses over the years. The north rotunda has been a casino and restaurant - and is set for redevelopment again.\nOn the south bank in Govan, the rotunda has served as a pop-up Nardini's ice cream shop during the Glasgow Garden Festival, a puppet show venue, and a \"Dome of Discovery\", before being extensively renovated as offices for Scottish marine engineering group Malin.\nMalin's marketing and business development director, Helenor Fisher, feels it is fitting that the building is now home to a marine engineering and transportation company that can trace is history back to the same era \"with a shared aim of safely transporting cargo\".\nLast year, for Doors Open Day, the company welcomed the public into the rotunda. They were not permitted to enter the tunnel, but Helenor filmed a walkthrough video showing the visitors what it was like.\nA small metal staircase which has now replaced the old wooden treads descends into the shaft before concrete steps lead into the tunnel itself.\n\"I felt some trepidation as it's a pretty sharp descent,\" she recalled. \"I remember seeing a tile with the name of the firm that made the tunnel on the wall.\"\n\"I think I imagined the tunnel itself was going to be pretty unpleasan",

    "Egypt has built more than 3km of wall in the past week in addition to further clearance of a large area next to its border with Gaza, BBC Verify has found.\nIt comes after Israel warned it is preparing for a ground offensive in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.\nThe city has seen a huge increase in its population in recent months.\nEgyptian authorities say \"no provisions\" are being made for displaced Palestinians and the area is meant for a \"logistical hub\" for aid.\nBut an aid worker for a UK charity, who is part of the humanitarian efforts in Gaza, told the BBC she had \"never seen large scale clearing of land\" for such a logistical hub and they were unaware of any such plan.\nWhat do the latest images show?\nMore than 16 sq km (6 sq miles) have been cleared just over the border from Gaza, visible in the recent satellite images.\nThe clearing of this area began at the start of February, but has expanded dramatically over the past week.\nSections of wall around this area now appear to be under construction.\nOn 14 February, about 0.8km (0.5 miles) of wall were visible in satellite imagery, but the most recent pictures indicate more that than 4km (2.5 miles) has now been erected.\nThe wall appears to be being built simultaneously in three places - in this image you can see construction in the south-west corner of the cleared area.\nWhat appears to be a crane and other vehicles can be seen near construction materials.\nIn the south-east corner, you can see a build up of trucks along the main road which leads from north Egypt into Gaza.\nSome of these trucks are parked off the main road and within the newly-cleared area.\nWhat is the area for?\nFollowing reports the area was being made to house Palestinian refugees, Egypt publicly denied it was making any such preparations.\nSince the start of the Gaza war following Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, Egypt has consistently said it would not open its border to refugees.\nIt has taken that stance partly because it does not want to appear complicit in the large-scale displacement of Palestinians, but also out of economic and security concerns.\nAnd Israel has previously said that it has \"no intention of evacuating Palestinian civilians to Egypt\".\nThe authorities in Egypt's North Sinai province released a statement saying \"the armed forces are setting up a logistical area to receive aid for Gaza\" to ease the congestion on the roads near the border.\nThe local governor said the area was being prepared for \"truck waiting areas, secure warehouses, administrative offices, and driver accommodations\".\nHowever, the BBC has spoken to a humanitarian expert, who is part of a group which coordinates aid efforts into Gaza, and she says they haven't heard of any such plan.\n\"If there was a plan to suddenly increase the capacity by constructing a hub of sorts, I would suggest that this would have been shared [with aid agencies] by the Egyptian authorities,\" she said.\nThe aid worker didn't want to be named, as it could complicate the relationship between the aid organisation she works for and the Egyptian authorities.\n\"The capacity for warehousing in Egypt is something that is discussed at almost every meeting. Given that this hasn't been shared, my assumption is that this is not what the plan is,\" she added.\nWe showed the latest satellite images to several security experts to see what they thought its purpose could be.\nAndreas Krieg, a senior lecturer in security studies at Kings College, London, said: \"You do not need to clear that much ground to stage waiting trucks. To me, it very much looks like Egypt making preparations for the worst-case scenario.\"\n\"If you put this in perspective of how big this area this is, 16 km sq of trucks, that is thousands and thousands of trucks. There's never been a situation where you've had thousands of trucks waiting at the border.\"\nGraphics by Filipa Silverio",

    "Michigan voters have sent a clear warning to the White House that Joe Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza could cost him dearly in the presidential election in November.\nActivists encouraged people voting in Tuesday's Democratic primary to withhold their votes from President Biden and instead mark the box marked \"uncommitted\" as a protest. More than 100,000 voters did just that.\nThe protest vote - while a sharp rebuke - poses no immediate danger to Mr Biden, who still won the contest with 81% of the vote. He's the incumbent president and has no serious challenger from within his party, so he can't lose the race to choose the Democratic candidate.\nBut what if all the people who withheld their support from him this time don't come out to vote for him in the general election? That could be decisive.\nEvery vote counts in a key swing state that the US president almost certainly needs to win to have a shot at a second term. In 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton lost Michigan to Donald Trump by fewer than 11,000 ballots.\nMr Trump, following his own victory in the Republican primary, declared: \"We win Michigan, we win the whole thing.\"\nThis Midwestern state is home to America's largest Arab-American population, most of whom are deeply upset by the devastation they see in Gaza.\nPresident Biden can't afford to ignore their demands that he call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza - rather than the temporary one that the White House has been pushing for. He did not mention the war or the protest vote in his statement following his victory, but his campaign team will have surely heard the message loud and clear.\nI asked Leyla Elabed, manager of the \"Listen to Michigan\" campaign, if she was worried she might be inadvertently helping Donald Trump back into the White House by damaging Joe Biden's electability.\n\"If Biden doesn't act now, and listen to the 80% of Democrats and the 66% of Americans that want a permanent ceasefire right now,\" she told me before Tuesday's primary, \"it is going to be Biden, his administration and the Democratic Party that are going to be accountable for handing the White House to Trump in November.\"\nPresident Biden has offered some recent criticism of Israel's conduct of the war, describing it as \"over the top\". He appears to be becoming increasingly frustrated with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and has warned that Israel is at risk of losing international support.\nHis administration is strongly advocating for a temporary ceasefire over the Muslim holiday of Ramadan that would include an exchange of  Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. But Mr Biden says it's not the right time to call for the permanent ceasefire his detractors in Michigan are demanding.\nDissatisfaction on this issue goes beyond the Arab-American and Muslim communities, however. Many younger voters - another key part of the electoral coalition that voted for the oldest-ever US president - are also angry. Regular protests are taking place on college campuses across America.\nIn Detroit, the views of students from the Wayne State College Democrats highlighted President Biden's vulnerability on the issue.\nKaron Heath, 18, an anthropology and law major, said she was enraged that the White House had not been advocating for a permanent ceasefire despite months of war and \"heartbreaking\" scenes in Gaza.\nTaylor James, 22, who is studying economics, believes the US - Israel's strongest international ally - should stop sending aid to Mr Netanyahu's government.\nBut Cassidy Collins did vote for Mr Biden on Tuesday. She thinks he needs all the support he can get to stop Mr Trump from returning to the White House. She described that prospect as \"one of the most scariest things I could possibly imagine\".\nEach of these students said they wished Mr Biden had stood aside and allowed another candidate to get the Democratic nomination this year. They think that at 81, he is too old to understand the concerns of their generation, and that he hasn't been aggressive enough on climate change or on forgiving student loan debt.\nThe complaints from these young people - each of them a signed-up Democrat - were different to the concerns I tend to hear from undecided voters who are considering backing Donald Trump. Those moderate voters - whom I've met in the wine bars of Atlanta, the sandwich shops of Philadelphia and the rural outposts of Iowa - often help decide who wins the White House.\nThey've told me they felt much better off when Donald Trump was in office. And they're not convinced yet by the Biden administration's attempts to persuade Americans the economy is improving.\nMore on the US election\nNearly every voter also cites the record levels of illegal immigration at the southern border.\nIt's a vulnerability that explains why Mr Biden is about to tackle the immigration issue head on with a high-profile visit to the border on Thursday. Donald Trump will also be there on the same day to argue that Mr Biden's policies are to blame for the crisi",

A number of civil society organisations have also declined to take part in the exercise.\nMr Sall, who is on his way to the Nigerian capital, Abuja, for an extraordinary summit of the regional bloc Ecowas, has been under pressure to announce a new date since Senegal's highest court declared last week that the postponement of the poll was illegal.\nHis original decree to delay the vote received strong condemnation from the international community.\nMany feared the postponement would lead to President Sall's remaining leader of the country indefinitely in a region plagued by coups and military governments.\nSpeaking on national television on Thursday evening, Mr Sall said he felt there was not enough time to vote in a new president by the time he steps down on 2 April. He said that the dialogue forum would decide what should happen if this was the case.\nIn a show of good faith, the president said he was prepared to release the popular opposition politician, Ousmane Sonko, from prison. His arrest sparked nationwide protests last year.\nDozens of the president's opponents have already been set free since Senegal's Constitutional Council ruled that his decision to postpone the election was illegal.\nBut the fact that the president did not set a new election date has further fuelled suspicions by his critics that this is just another stalling tactic.\nPresident Sall has served two terms as Senegal's leader and when he was first elected in 2012 he promised he would not overstay.\nHis televised interview has not yet restored his country's reputation as a bastion of democracy in an increasingly totalitarian region.\nMore on Senegal's political turmoil:",

    "It wasn't in bustling London, busy Berlin or even crowded Tokyo - the birth of your morning commute wasn't even in a major city.\nIt started high in a Welsh valley when the Elon Musks and Mark Zuckerbergs of the 19th Century bet on whether you could make a rail locomotive move on its own.\nHistory was made in 1804 when Cornish inventing pioneer Richard Trevithick's engine moved on tracks under its own steam.\n\"It was a moment that changed the world forever,\" said TV historian Dan Snow.\nThe origins of the Orient Express, Trans-Siberian Railway, Hogwarts Express and Thomas The Tank Engine can be traced back to Trevithick's modest locomotive that is regarded by experts as the world's first railway engine.\n\"Up until that point, nearly everyone lived and died within 30 miles of where they were born and the fastest anyone could go was the speed of a galloping horse,\" added Snow.\n\"Look at the world now. Many have families in other counties, people have married people from different parts of the world, you work alongside people from all over the world - we're taken to work in trains, buses, cars and even aeroplanes.\n\"It was an extraordinary moment for the human race, a massive technological breakthrough. That revolution began in Merthyr Tydfil.\n\"The best thing is he does it in response to a bet between the wealthy entrepreneurs, the Elon Musks and Mark Zuckerbergs of the day,\" said Snow.\nWhat was the first railway engine?\nTrevithick had already pioneered high pressure stationary steam engines for mining and driving machinery and Welsh iron entrepreneur Samuel Homfray bought shares in his patent and brought him to his works in Merthyr Tydfil.\n\"Trevithick had already created an engine called the Puffing Devil in 1801, which was basically a steam train on the road that moved under its own power,\" said Snow.\n\"But it caught fire and was destroyed, so that didn't really work. He'd got static steam engines working but dreamed of making wagons move without horses.\"\nHomfray encouraged Trevithick to put a steam-powered engine onto a rail-mounted locomotive to travel over newly laid tramroad from his works at Penydarren to a canal wharf at Abercynon nine-and-three-quarters-of-a-mile (16km) away - so Homfray's iron could be shipped from there around the globe quicker.\nRichard Crawshay, a rival ironmaking baron in Merthyr, was apparently sceptical about the new engine so he and Homfray placed a 500 guineas wager - or \u00c2\u00a3525, which was then an estimated lifetime earnings - on whether it would work.\nWhen did the world's first railway locomotive run?\nAfter about 12 months of building, Trevithick's ground-breaking unnamed five-tonne locomotive carried 70 people and 10 tons of iron along the banks of the River Taff down the valley to Abercynon on 21 February 1804.\nTrevithick said afterwards: \"We proceeded on our journey with the engine... the engine, while working, went nearly five miles an hour; there was no water put into the boiler from the time we started until our journey's end... the coal consumed was two hundredweight\".\nOn the return journey, a bolt sheared on what is now more widely known as the Penydarren loco, causing the boiler to leak.\nThe fire had to be dropped so the engine did not get back to Merthyr until the following day.\nThe ground-breaking locomotive was also rail-breaking too as it was so heavy it broke the rails of the tramroad and was later converted into a stationary engine that drove a forge hammer at Homfray's Penydarren works.\n\"Nevertheless, Trevithick proved a locomotive could not just move itself but could pull viable load a significant distance,\" said Museum Wales' Principal Curator Jennifer Protheroe-Jones.\n\"It also silenced doubters who felt that smooth iron wheels wouldn't be able to grip smooth iron track but Trevithick showed that it could.\n\"It really was the beginning of a revolution in rail transport. The Penydarren loco is the great grandfather of all railway locomotives as those primitive beginnings was where it all began.\"\nWhy was the first railway locomotive in Wales?\nWales is regarded as one of the world's first industrial nations and south Wales was the heartbeat of the revolution and centre of innovation, mining coal in the valleys and shipped around the globe.\n\"Something extraordinary was happening in Wales 200 years ago when it basically became the world's first region to industrialise - and it would change the world,\" said Snow.\n\"The way that we all live now - in our factories, our commutes, our mechanised lives, working in globalised industries, all begins in Wales and the West Midlands.\"\nMerthyr Tydfil was the centre of iron production and by the early 1800s was Wales' most populated town.\nWorkers from around the world, including Trevithick, came to work in the ironworks.\n\"Wales was one of the great crucibles of the Industrial Revolution, which was sweeping Europe and later the world,\" added Ms Protheroe-Jones.\n\"Swansea was the world centre for copper making, Wales was the centre of world",

Night Shyamalan film The Last Airbender, but added: \"It will leave fans wishing the streamer had left DiMartino and Konietzko's masterpiece alone.\"\nShe added: \"While the show's visuals and its Asian and Indigenous stars add authenticity to the series, the performances of the majority of the cast, no matter how earnest, don't hold up to the weight of the narrative.\n\"Many of the series' portrayals lack the extensive emotion needed to carry a show centring on the horrors of genocide, war and totalitarianism.\"\nThe show's legal team will be keen to point out that this has nothing to do with Avatar itself, the highest-grossing film ever made, but is still a big hit with fantasy lovers.\nWithout giving too much away, the premise of the series is there are four divided kingdoms, defined by fire, earth, water and air - with the \"benders\" who live in them harnessing these elements into some sort of magical power.\nIts main characters include 12-year-old Aang, played by Gordon Cormier, who teams up with 14-year-old Katara (Kiawentiio) and her older brother Sokka (Ian Ousley), to save their kingdoms.\nThe Guardian's Jack Seale was more complimentary, awarding the series four stars.\n\"The landscapes sparkle, there is a giant six-legged flying bison that carries everyone spectacularly from place to place through the clouds and the young cast are up to the task,\" he wrote.\n\"The Airbender franchise has confidently revived itself; this won't be the last we see of it.\"\n'Rather drab and thinly sketched'\nHowever, Empire's Kambole Campbell gave the series just two stars, adding that it \"sadly mostly sheds the original's cartoonish charm and dynamic presentation in favour of more self-serious fantasy\".\nHe added that it is \"a rather drab and thinly sketched spin on well-worn fantastical tales of oppression and rebellion\" and despite each episode running for an hour, \"the show somehow feels too long and too short at the same time\".\nThere was a middling review from the Telegraph's Anita Singh, who awarded it three out of a possible five stars.\n\"It's solid entertainment,\" she said. \"Fast-moving, action-packed, with decent fight scenes and some appealing performances, all done on a generous Netflix budget.\n\"Don't expect subtlety - this is aimed at children so the characters and plot are broadly drawn.\"\nSingh said she watched it with her children, the agegroup the series is broadly aimed at, who also gave their own review - \"It's good,\" they said, \"but not as good as SpongeBob SquarePants.\"\n'The acting is wooden'\nWhilst most reviews have drawn some positives from the show, the same can't be said for that of Vulture's Jackson McHenry.\n\"From the very start, the live-action series has a lot of flaws,\" he wrote. \"The acting is wooden, the writing is even more wooden, the costumes are garish, the score drones on annoyingly, and it all looks like it was filmed through a light glaze of mud.\n\"But worst of all, the self-serious, hour-long premiere of the new series is simply dull. It's hard not to zone out somewhere along the way, and harder still to muster the enthusiasm to continue on for seven more instalments,\" he added.\n\"What should have felt like an exciting adventure romp instead feels like being handed a homework assignment, which is a rough fate for something based on a Nickelodeon kids' cartoon.\"\nBut Paul Tassi of Forbes was more positive, writing: \"You can tell this is made by a cast and crew that have a lot of love for the source material.\n\"It is not as good as the animated series,\" he continued. \"Of course it isn't. This is painting the Mona Lisa with coloured pencil, where it may be great in its own right, but it's just an entirely different medium that could never live up to the original masterpiece.\"\nHowever, he concluded: Despite a mountain of scepticism, including from myself who counts the original as one of my favourite shows ever, I have to say Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender is much better than I thought it would be. By the end, I genuinely enjoyed it.\"",

    "The Ministry of Defence says it is pausing its plans to change the allocation of military housing after strong criticism from Army families.\nUnder the plan, serving personnel would have got subsidised housing based on their need, such as how many children they have, rather than their rank.\nBut there had been significant opposition to the move from officers, with a number threatening to quit.\nThe defence minister said the MoD U-turn came after listening to feedback.\nAndrew Murrison said elements of the New Accommodation Model, which is due to be launched in March, would be paused and a review would be conducted.\nIf the policy was implemented, it would have meant those with larger families getting larger houses, regardless of seniority.\nThe move had prompted fears the crisis in army recruitment and retention could get worse.\nThe BBC obtained testimony from dozens of officers and their partners saying they would quit if they were forced into smaller living quarters.\nOne said the move would drive out quality officers and tear the heart out of the organisation.\nAnother said: \"[I] Signed off before Christmas and changes to service family accommodation was one of the factors that influenced us as a childless couple\".\nA number of military families who would benefit had expressed support for the scheme. But it has been divisive enough for the MoD to think again.\nThe defence ministry said it was still committed to widening the entitlement and upgrading military accommodation. But for now it is clearly not prepared to pick a fight with so many military families - with the armed forces already struggling with retention and recruitment.\nBefore the MoD announcement on Monday, more than 300 officers took part in a poll on social media and 78% said they would be prepared to leave if their accommodation entitlement is reduced.\nUnder the proposals, a married major with no children would have been entitled to a two-bedroom property instead of a three- or four-bedroom house - leaving them with around 38% less space.\nA married private with three children would get a larger house - gaining around 27% more space.\nMany officers and their families saw the plans as the removal of one of the last remaining perks to deal with the unpredictability of service life - which sees many posted to different locations every few years.\nOne lieutenant colonel told the BBC: \"Based on the new accommodation model, we have decided that remaining in service is no longer a tenable situation for us.\"\nAnother lieutenant colonel said: \"I have started to consider leaving since the announcement of this policy. It's the removal of another perk, and the pros no longer outweigh the cons.\"",
    "Bank of Ireland's annual pre-tax profit rose by 92% in 2023 to just under \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2bn (\u00c2\u00a31.7bn).\nBut its UK retail division, which includes its Northern Ireland business, saw its profit fall slightly from \u00e2\u0082\u00ac276m (\u00c2\u00a3236m) to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac271m (\u00c2\u00a3231m)\nThe bank said this reflected lower lending volumes in the UK driven by its \"value over volume\" approach.\nThis means the bank is targeting only more profitable lending opportunities, particularly in mortgages.\nAs part of this strategy it has ended its financial services partnership with the AA in the UK and stopped offering unsecured personal loans under the BoI (UK) and Post Office brands.\nThe bank also has a substantial car finance business in the UK which trades as Northridge Finance.\nAn investigation into whether people had been paying too much for car finance in the UK was launched by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) last month.\nThe FCA is looking at \"discretionary commission arrangements\" under which some lenders had allowed car dealers to adjust interest rates on loans, which would improve the commission they received.\nIn short, the higher the interest rate, the higher the commission, creating an incentive for brokers to increase how much people were charged for their car loan.\nSome banks, such as Lloyds, have already begun to set aside money to cover the potential costs arising from this investigation.\nHowever Bank of Ireland has not taken that step saying it is \"not considered that a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred in relation to these matters that would require a provision to be recognised at this stage\".\n'Signs of resilience'\nIt added that it is not currently practicable to estimate the extent of any financial impact.\nThe bank said its overall strong performance was driven by its consumer banking division in Ireland where income more than doubled.\nChief Executive Myles O'Grady said the Irish economy was showing \"clear signs of resilience\" including total employment increasing to a record 2.7m people towards the end of last year.\nRising interest rates are generally good for bank profits as they enable banks to increase the \"spread\" between what they charge borrowers and pay to savers.\nThat spread is known as the net interest margin (NIM) and at Bank of Ireland it increased from less than 2% in 2022 to just over 3% in 2023.",
    "Campaigners have staged a protest over plans for a huge solar farm in Lincolnshire which it is claimed could power 180,000 homes.\nThe 1,400-hectare Springwell Solar Farm site between Lincoln and Sleaford would be 10 times the size of London's Hyde Park, with a capacity of 800MW.\nDevelopers said they were listening to the concerns of local people to ensure the proposals were \"appropriate\".\nCampaigners said it was the \"sheer size of the development\" they oppose.\nEDF Renewables UK and Luminous Energy, the companies behind the plans, said the project would have a lifespan of around 40 years, after which the land would return to agricultural use.\nHowever Marc Williams, 52, said: \"They are essentially destroying massive amounts of prime agricultural land for something that produces little power by comparison to wind turbines.\n\"The locals are not anti-solar, but they are pro reasonable solutions. And this has disenfranchised a huge number of people.\"\nOthers told the Local Democracy Reporting Service they were concerned about the impact on wildlife and the environment.\nMichael Credland, 76, said: \"The beauty of the rural countryside is being destroyed.\n\"It feels totally political and residents are having the wool pulled over their eyes. The only thing this will generate is profits,\" he added.\nMartin Elvin, 68, from Digby, said the agricultural sector had been \"under serious attack\" for some time and so farmers were not to blame for being tempted by this offer of leasing land for solar farms.\nLocal MPs have also voiced their opposition to large-scale energy projects in the county.\nSir John Hayes, Conservative MP for South Holland and The Deepings, raised his concerns about food security and the \"industrialisation of the countryside\" during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.\nIn response Rishi Sunak said the government had taken steps \"to protect prime agricultural land from large-scale solar developments\".\nThe protest follows a public consultation and a series of in-person events for residents to learn more about the project.\nDarren Cuming, head of development at EDF Renewables UK, said changes had been made as a result of the feedback, including removing proposed panels that were close to roads and residential properties.\n\"We want to be a good neighbour but difficult choices have to be made around the country to reach net-zero targets and we need projects like this to get there,\" he said.\nGiven its status as a nationally significant infrastructure project, it would be for the Secretary of State for Energy Security, Claire Coutinho, to decide on the proposals.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram .

    "When Gabriela Capote was made redundant from her marketing job last year, she decided that she needed to learn about AI to get the edge in securing her next role.\n\"After getting laid off from a job that I thought was so perfect and secure, it really woke me up,\" says Ms Capote, who lives in Miami.\n\"It taught me something important about how nothing is actually permanent, and that I don't want to get complacent. I'd heard the big, bad, scary conversation about AI for a while, and I've always been interested in how I could utilise it.\"\nInstead of just hunting for a new marketing job, Ms Capote enrolled on a six-week, online AI training program. This was provided by a global training organisation called Mission Impact Academy (Mia).\nLaunched in 2022, Mia's courses are aimed specifically at women, with the aim of getting more women employed in work that includes the use of AI.\nMs Capote says that the certification helped her to get a new communications job at an insurance firm. \"Saying that I was certified in AI made me stand out from all the other applicants, and I think was a big reason as to why I was offered the role.\n\"And my new company is very open to hearing about anything I think would be good from a tech perspective.\"\nMs Capote adds that her increased understanding of AI also helped her search for the job at the insurance company in the first place. She says that she put her resume into popular AI chatbots ChatGPT and Bard, and asked them to find possible vacancies for her. She quickly got a list of 50.\nThere is currently a gender AI gap, with 54% of men using technology in either their job or personal life, compared with only 35% of women, according to one report from last year.\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nA growing number of women are now upskilling themselves to bridge that gap. For example, online learning platform Coursera says there has been a big jump in the number of women signing up to its \"AI for Everyone\" course.\nLast year, this was the sixth most popular course for its 1.58 million female learners in the UK, up from 59th place in 2022.\nHeather Black is the founder and chief executive of Supermums, which offers tech training courses aimed at women returning to the workforce after having children. Last year it launched its first AI course.\n\"With the pace that technology is changing and evolving, and given how we're always so saturated with information, the gender disparity in AI will increase if we don't have very specific ways for women to learn about it,\" says London-based Ms Black.\nWith a recent study by the UN finding that women may be at a higher risk of their jobs being made obsolete by AI, due to their overrepresentation in administrative and clerical work, training courses aimed specifically at women may help many keep their positions, or more easily find new ones.\nGeorgina Cosma, professor in AI and data science at Loughborough University, says that equipping more women with AI skills is paramount for securing their future in industries increasingly shaped by the technology.\nYet she cautions that women-only courses must meet rigorous industry standards. \"If programmes limit complexity or content, there is a risk they could contribute to outdated assumptions, and isolate women in technology further rather than integrating talent more broadly.\n\"The goal is to promote inclusion by offering solid training to help qualified women gain the skills to advance to roles similar to equally qualified peers.\"\nProf Cosma adds that women in the growing AI sector also need more mentorship programs, relevant networking opportunities, and hiring practices designed to counteract unconscious bias. \"Achieving true gender parity demands a shift in both attitudes and policies that influence access and career progression in AI.\"\nJanna Salokangas, co-founder of Miami-based Mia, says that its AI course is not just about the training, but also about giving the students a sense of togetherness. \"It's all about the energy, the inclusion and belonging they get being part of a community, and learning with other women,\" she says.",

    "The deputy prime minister has declined to say whether Lee Anderson's comments were Islamophobic and said the MP would have kept his role had he apologised.\nOn Saturday Mr Anderson was suspended as a Conservative MP after refusing to apologise for saying London Mayor Sadiq Khan is controlled by \"Islamists\".\nOliver Dowden told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that Mr Anderson was not \"intending to be Islamophobic\".\nLabour has renewed its criticism of the Tory party's response.\nIn a letter to the prime minister, Labour said it was right to suspend Mr Anderson \"after his disgusting racist and Islamophobic remarks\".\nMr Khan, mayor of London, has already said the comments were \"Islamophobic, anti-Muslim and racist\" and that they \"pour fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred.\"\nOn Friday Mr Anderson prompted fury after he said: \"I don't actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they've got control of Khan and they've got control of London, and they've got control of Starmer as well.\"\nHe later added: \"People are just turning up in their thousands, and doing anything they want, and they are laughing at our police. This stems with Khan, he's actually given our capital city away to his mates\".\nOn Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Dowden was asked repeatedly whether he would say those comments were Islamophobic. He declined to do so, but said: \"I share concerns about how it could be taken that way.\"\nHe went on to say: \"The fact it could be taken that way is the reason why the [Conservative] chief whip asked for an apology\".\nHe added that he understood that Mr Anderson's comments \"have caused offence\".\nBut he defended how the party had handled the situation, adding that asking him to apologise for the remarks was \"the appropriate step to take\".\nMr Anderson said he had accepted the party had \"no option\" but to suspend him, given the \"difficult position\" it put the government in. However, he has not apologised for what he said.\nOn Sky News, Mr Dowden said while Mr Anderson's comments were \"wrong\", he declined to be drawn on whether they were racist.\nFellow Tory MP and former Conservative cabinet minister Sir Robert Buckland told the BBC Mr Anderson's remarks were racist.\n\"It crosses a line.

I feel great, back to normal again,\" he said.\n\"They way they look after people is fantastic.\"\nJimmy is now getting in touch with contacts in the Premier League for memorabilia to raise money for the charity.\nThe charity has been running for 40 years, and relies heavily on donations.\nMs Bache said: \"Utilities have rocketed sky-high because the general cost of living has increased so much, people aren't wanting to donate as much to charities now.\n\"They have other costs that they need to deal with first.\"\nCharities such as Heartbeat can apply for some public funding, but Ms Bache said that in practice it can be very difficult.\nShe said: \"We seem to come across a block (where we're told), 'Yes, we think this would be a funded programme, but either money's run out or there's not enough to fund it.'\"\nPrevious attempts have stalled before the application was even formally submitted.\n'Critical point'\nThe National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) is trying to get the funding process for charities such as Heartbeat made simpler, and for more long-term grants to allow a stable funding stream.\nNCVO policy and insights manager Sam Mercadante said trying to secure funding was common challenge for members.\n\"We know this kind of work requires stability, it requires sustainable funding, it requires planning for the future.\n\"Often the impacts that organisations are trying to create in their communities take many years.\n\"You want people and communities to have the reassurance that the service they need will be there for the long term,\" she said.\nAfter a gap of several years, the charity is about to begin the application process again for another grant, while still pushing ahead with fundraising.\nMs Crossley says it has reached a critical point.\n\"If we don't get the funding from somewhere else the worry is that Heartbeat won't be here after two or three years,\" she said.\n\"So anyone further down the line, or someone's family, they won't have Heartbeat to come to, and that would be a terrible shame after 40 years\".\nNHS England said it could not comment on Heartbeat's specific case, but said legislation introduced in 2022 supported local health funding for suitable charities.\nWhy not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "A County Armagh sheep farmer has said he may give up his flock after 28 of his lambs were killed in a dog attack.\nGeorge Carvill, from Middletown, said it was a \"terrible experience\" for him and his teenage son Frank.\nFrom April 2017 to September 2023, there were 738 instances of livestock worrying, according to the latest Stormont figures.\nInsurers NFU Mutual said farm animals worth \u00c2\u00a3147,000 were injured or killed by dogs last year.\nIn 2022, livestock attacks were valued at \u00c2\u00a3165,000.\nMr Carvill said he discovered the attack when he \"met a lamb lying dead at the gate\" last December.\nIn his field, there were more dead animals and he told BBC News NI: \"We knew straight away that this was a dog attack.\"\n\"There were some of them pushed into the river and drowned,\" he added.\nThe farmer said his family had used the 50-acre land for more than half a century and it was their first dog attack since 1983.\n\"There are a lot more dogs around now in Middletown,\" he told Good Morning Ulster on Monday .\n\"It seems that now people maybe aren't thinking - they let a dog out in the evening for a run thinking that the dog is doing no harm.\n\"But if you're not being responsible with your dog, you don't know where it is, and this is the kind of thing that can happen.\"\nNorthern Ireland livestock worrying statistics\nProvided by councils and collated by the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs\nIn all, 13 of George's lambs - some with facial injuries - survived the attack by jumping into the next field.\n\"We brought them up to the yard and it was two days before they started to feed, they were in total shock.\"\nGeorge said the attack had \"a huge impact\" financially.\n\"Going forward, I don't know if we are going to be able to stay in the sheep business,\" he added.\n'Trying to make a living'\nCounty Antrim sheep farmer, Robin McMurtry, 50, lost two sheep in a dog attack in September 2022.\nThe dogs were later traced and put down, he said.\n\"A dog can jump fences, slip in under a gate,\" he said.\n\"And if a dog gets in among sheep, there's nothing you can do.\n\"There's always that situation that if you hear a dog barking at night, you're thinking 'is that somebody's pet or is that something that's chasing through a field?'\n\"At the end of the day, you're trying to make a living.

    "Bobi the dog has been posthumously stripped of his title as world's oldest dog over a dispute about his real age.\nGuinness World Records (GWR) said it had no evidence that the elderly canine, who died last year, was as old as claimed.\nThe organisation said the microchip claimed to prove Bobi's age was not sufficient proof to grant him the title, awarded in February last year.\nGWR said it had not yet determined which dog is the new record holder.\nBobi was a Rafeiro do Alentejo from Conqueiros, Portugal.\nThe breed typically lives for around 12-14 years. But when Bobi was awarded the award, it was claimed that he was 30 years old.\nBobi died in October 2023 , at the reported age of 31 years and 165 days.\nBut GWR launched an investigation into the evidence used to prove the title last month, following doubts being raised over its reliability in proving Bobi's age.\nGWR said: \"We're left with no conclusive evidence which can definitively prove Bobi's date of birth.\n\"Without any conclusive evidence available to us right now, we simply can't retain Bobi as the record holder.\"\nBobi's owner, Leonel Costa, has not commented on the record's removal, but had previously said suspicions over the veracity of the dog's age were \"unfounded\".\nLast month, Danny Chambers of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons told the Guardian that \"not a single one\" of his vet colleagues believed that the dog actually lived to 31.\nThe previous oldest dog ever was Australia's Bluey, who died in 1939 at the age of 29 years and five months.",

Many councils' systems are not designed to support care leavers in the best way.\n\"It's not an exaggeration to say that is causing tragedy on a daily basis for people who are not getting that support.\"\nThe county council has become the 81st local authority in the country to recognise care experience as a protected character.\nIt follows Blaby District Council and Oadby and Wigston Borough Council in taking the step in Leicestershire.\n'Discrimination, stigma and prejudice'\n\"Change will not happen overnight but each council, that does what Leicestershire has, is really doing something to improve people's lives,\" Mr Galloway said.\n\"District councils particularly can help because they run services like housing where often care leavers face discrimination.\"\nThe council's deputy leader and cabinet member for young people Debra Taylor said the step would help shape council policy to support people who had been in care.\n\"Many care-experienced people face discrimination, stigma and prejudice daily often finding it challenging to access support,\" she said.\n\"Public perception of care experience is often centred on the idea that children [in care] are damaged.\"\nMrs Taylor added: \"This stigma often comes with assumptions about their likely characteristic of children and adults with care experience.\n\"This can lead to them being refused employment and to unfair judgements about their ability to parent.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

Royal Navy nuclear submarine Trident II missile fails for a second time in a row,\" its headline said.\nThe Global Times article recalled earlier failures of the Trident programme, including when a missile \"flew mistakenly towards the US\" during a test in June 2016.\nThat missile was reportedly intended to be fired 3,700 miles (5,954 km) to a sea target off the west coast of Africa . What went wrong remains top secret, but the Sunday Times quoted a senior naval source as saying the missile suffered an in-flight malfunction after launching out of the water.\nThe Global Times piece added: \"It is worth mentioning that not long ago, the Royal Navy's HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier also encountered an embarrassing malfunction.\"\nIt noted that the HMS Prince of Wales, which replaced the Queen Elizabeth carrier in a series of exercises , \"experienced a minor incident\" of its own , causing a further delay.\nElsewhere, Turkish media outlets have widely covered the failed Trident test. \"The UK almost shot its own minister,\" the pro-government Aksam newspaper website said.\n\"Fiasco during missile test: British Defence Minister barely escaped death,\" the pro-government Milliyet newspaper website reported.\nThere have been no suggestions from UK officials or media reports that Mr Shapps came to any harm at all.\n\"British nuclear missile test fails, again,\" was the headline on the New York Times's report, which added this raised \"questions about the state of Britain's nuclear deterrence capability\".\n\"Britain's Navy has suffered a string of problems in recent months with its fleet,\" the article said.\nResearch and additional reporting by BBC Monitoring",

    "When Ukrainian miner Vasyl Yavorsky donated his own wages to striking Welsh miners in 1984, he never thought that help would one day be returned.\nHowever, a group of Welsh miners have now loaded up on medicine and supplies and driven from south Wales to Kyiv to repay the old favour.\nThe convoy is supplying much needed aid to miners fighting on the front line, two years after Russian forces invaded.\n\"They did not forget about us, just like we didn't in 1984,\" said Vasyl.\nCommunities in Wales affected by the miners' strike in the 1980s received much-needed support from the former Soviet Union, and from around the world.\n\"We are mining brothers - I remember the donation box we had, everyone donated as much as they could, and sent it to those miners\", said Vasyl.\n\"Now 40 years later we are in need, seeking help, and our English and Welsh friends responded, and are helping our soldiers on the frontlines.\"\nIt is a four-decades-old bond that bridges a strike and now a war, forged in shared experiences underground.\nIn Ukraine, there are currently hundreds, if not thousands, of miners fighting on the front lines in the war against Russia.\nWayne Thomas, who organised the trip, said he had \"never forgotten\" the support from Ukrainian miners during the strikes.\n\"I was one of the men on strike 40 years ago. I was a young man then, with a wife and child,\" said Mr Thomas, head of the National Union of Mineworkers in south Wales.\n\"I am now very proud to have the opportunity to show how grateful I am for the support we received then from Ukrainian miners,\" he added.\nHe was joined on the journey by fellow former miner Carwyn Donovan and Welsh-Ukrainian Member of the Senedd Mick Antoniw, who has had relatives killed in the war.\nMr Antoniw said the gesture was important to commemorate the donations of food and money received from Ukraine during the strikes.\n\"The people we are delivering these supplies to are not only fighting on the front line, but some of the older ones were the ones collecting money and food for Welsh miners,\" he said.\n\"This is about repaying them and reminding people that Ukraine is the frontline of democracy in the fight against Russian aggression.\"\nIn 1984 miners from all over the world, including Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union arrived in Britain to support the strike.\nSome were hosted by the former Swansea East MP Sian James, who took a group to her local shop in Ystradgynlais, Powys.\nShe said: \"They were from behind the iron curtain, so we took them over to the Golden Save - they were absolutely entranced by it.\n\"We were saying it's a shop, it's a corner shop, it's a local supermarket. They couldn't get over how many goods were on the shelves, or the variety of things.\"\nOne of those impacted by their visit to the UK was Mykhailo Volynets, the now-president of KVPU, the independent Union of Ukrainian miners, who welcomed the Welsh convoy in Kyiv.\nHe said speaking to British miners about their struggles during a visit in the mid-1980s made him realise he \"lived in a country without truth\".\n\"Their brave fight influenced my outlook on life... after seeing how the UK miners behaved, I tried to copy their fight when I came back here.\"\nAlthough Mr Volynets said his attempts to set up independent trade union in Ukraine led to an \"order to kill me and my family, and my son was kidnapped, but he managed to survive\".\nHe would eventually find success in 1989, leading over a million miners on strike in the USSR, which preceded the break-up of the Soviet Union.\n\"We are grateful you are standing with us, we are grateful because you are miners, brave people not afraid to come to a country where you could lose your lives\", he added.",
    "The landing of a first commercial spacecraft on the Moon has sparked excitement about a new age of possibilities in the Solar System.\nNews of the touchdown of Odysseus near the lunar south pole was greeted with cheers by staff at American firm Intuitive Machines' (IM) mission control in Houston, Texas, on Thursday.\nIt is the first time an American craft has successfully landed on the Moon since 1972 - and the first time ever that a private company has done so.\nBut the giant leap for commercial kind could also help future state missions to the lunar surface and perhaps even aid plans to set up a lunar - or Martian - base for humans.\nNeil deGrasse Tyson, one of America's most famous astrophysicists, believes missions of this kind \"should have been happening decades ago\".\nBut he told the BBC's Americast that further state-funded missions might be needed before many private businesses look seriously at opportunities in space, given the level of up-front funding needed to get ventures off the ground.\n\"There is no business case to go into space first,\" Mr deGrasse Tyson argued.\nHe suggested that if the US put a base on Mars then \"after that's done, the expensive way, private enterprise can say 'well, maybe there is another way to get there that is cheaper'.\n\"Maybe you set up an amusement park or a tourist visiting site if it's cheap enough.\n\"But if you can't get the price down then it's not going to happen.\"\nThere are hopes that the touchdown could plant the seeds of a wider, thriving lunar economy. The vision involves a range of companies buying and selling services such as transport, communication and power.\nNasa is trying to encourage firms to get involved in exploration beyond Earth, with the US space agency engaging a number of companies to take its scientific instruments to the Moon. These private entities build, launch and operate their missions.\nNasa purchased room on Odysseus for six scientific instruments, and some of its equipment helped the robot craft overcome technical issues - demonstrating the capacity for private and state actors to co-operate successfully in the space exploration industry.\nThe mission is part of Nasa's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme, in which the agency is paying various private American companies for transport services to the Moon - in this particular case, with a fee of $118M (\u00c2\u00a393m).\nIM's effort follows that of another private entity, Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic, which set off for the Moon in early January but could not even attempt a landing because of technical problems.\nIM, which claims to \"open access to the Moon for the progress of humanity\", was founded by Kam Ghaffarian, Stephen Altemus and Tim Crain - all of whom have significantly lower profiles than the likes of Elon Musk and Richard Branson.\nThat billionaire duo have both tried their hands at different forms of private space exploration - with varying degrees of success - and are planning further forays.\nMany firms will see the risks and costs involved as reason enough to remain Earth-bound.\nBut other companies are also hoping to get involved in trips to the Moon, which had seen relatively little interest compared with the much-hyped - and state-based - \"Space Race\" of the mid to late 20th Century.\nOnly a handful of other countries have since successfully landed a spacecraft on the Moon's surface - the state space programmes of the then Soviet Union, China, India and Japan.\nYet in Europe, too, interest now appears to be picking up. Some of Odysseus' communications are being facilitated by Goonhilly Ltd in Cornwall, UK, which has several large radio dishes capable of picking up signals from the Moon's surface.\nNearby Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, of Guildford, is building a telecoms spacecraft that will circle the Moon to provide a relay service to anyone who needs to get data back to the Earth.\nMeanwhile, Nasa has a shortlist of lunar locations to send astronauts to later this decade in its Artemis programme - and one of them is Odysseus' targeted landing site, known as Malapert.\nIt is the southernmost point on the Moon ever visited by a spacecraft, and scientists think there could be frozen water nearby which could be vital to future missions.\nBut the key question is how sustainable a lunar economy can become long-term.\nWill there be enough activity at the Moon to justify investors' courage in building the emerging infrastructure?\nFor the foreseeable future, government funding will have to prop up this industry.\nThat all means it may be quite some time before a thriving lunar economy is able to establish itself.",
    "Energy prices really matter.\nDeveloped societies need copious quantities of energy to power our factories, to grow and preserve food, to allow people and goods to move around, and to warm or cool our homes.\nIf prices get too high, the cost of living rises. This was something that became only too apparent two years ago, when the combined effects of economies regaining momentum following the coronavirus pandemic, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sent energy costs soaring.\nThat helped produce a wave of inflation around the world, which in turn led central banks to push up interest rates - leading to much higher borrowing costs for businesses and individuals. Only now are we feeling the effects of that inflationary shock subside.\nIn the UK, where consumer prices for electricity and gas are capped, household bills are now at their lowest level in two years - but still high by historical standards.\nOn the flipside, if energy is too cheap, it removes the incentive to invest in more efficient and environmentally friendly technologies - and can lead to higher emissions.\nSo where will prices go over the next 12 months?\nOil\nBack in 2022, the price of Brent crude oil - one of the major global benchmarks - peaked at $139 a barrel, and averaged roughly $100. Last year was much calmer, with a peak of $98, and an average of $83.\nThat was despite factors such as the decision by the influential OPEC+ group of producer countries to extend, and in some cases expand, cuts in their output in an effort to support prices. In addition there were growing tensions in the Middle East as a result of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\nOver the next 12 months, demand for oil is expected to increase by around 1.1 million barrels per day, according to a report from analysts at the industry news service Energy Intelligence. However, they believe extra production from outside OPEC+ will be able to meet that demand.\nThat suggests prices should remain relatively stable. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned that \"rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which accounts for one third of the world's seaborne oil trade, has markets on edge\".\n\"If nothing goes wrong, we're looking at a balanced market, with prices hovering around $80 a barrel. But that's a big if,\" says Jorge L\u00c3\u00a9on, senior vice president at research firm Rystad Energy.\n\"So let's say there's an escalation in the Middle East. The main question to me is - what does Saudi Arabia do?\"\nSaudi Arabia is the world's biggest oil exporter, and it has the capacity to produce an extra 3.2 million barrels per day, according to the IEA.\n\"We don't think Saudi Arabia would want or allow prices to go up to the region of $150 a barrel. It could limit upward pressure by opening the taps. If it does that we could see a price of $90-95\", explains Mr Leon.\nPrices could also go down, for example if growth in major economies were to be lower than expected, and demand for oil weaker. Under those circumstances, members of OPEC+ could cut production again. However Mr Leon thinks decisive action is unlikely.\n\"I don't think there's enough muscle or cohesion in Opec+ to counterbalance those downward pressures,\" he says.\nThis, he suggests, would mean prices could fall as low as $70 per barrel in those circumstances.\nNatural gas\nWhen it comes to gas prices, analysts say a great deal will depend on what happens in Europe. The market there has experienced profound change over the past two years.\nRussia used to supply roughly 40% of the region's imported gas, much of it through pipelines. But following the invasion of Ukraine, those flows were heavily curtailed, and prices shot up. That had knock on effects on the cost of gas around the world, as governments scrambled to find new supplies.\nNow, things are very different. Shipments of liquified natural gas (LNG), much of it from the US and Qatar, have made up for the lost Russian exports. There has been a concerted effort to maximise storage, and consumption has fallen.\n\"We went cold turkey really, but we managed it. We've just got used to living without Russian pipeline gas,\" explains Dr Jack Sharples, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \"Europe has expanded its capacity to import LNG and reduced demand. The market has adapted.\"\nBut that does not mean prices will necessarily remain stable.  \"The market is balanced, but finely balanced\", says Dr Sharples. \"We're not in a crisis situation, but nor are we oversupplied.\"\nThis means there is a risk that disruptions to supply, or sudden increases in demand, could still cause sharp price rises. For example, a severe cold snap before the end of the European winter would deplete the region's reserves and mean more gas had to be brought in over the summer.\nTensions in the Red Sea region have already had an impact on LNG shipments this year.\nCargoes that would normally travel between Qatar and Europe, and between the US and Asia, using the Suez Canal have been diver",
    "The US has announced more than 500 new sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\nThese include measures against Russia's main card payment system, financial and military institutions, and officials involved in Navalny's imprisonment.\nThe EU has also announced new sanctions on access to military technology.\nThe measures mark a week since Navalny suddenly died in an Arctic Circle jail.\nUS President Joe Biden, who met Navalny's widow and daughter in San Francisco on Thursday, has said there can be \"no doubt\" the Russian president was to blame for his death.\nThe newly-announced US measures also include nearly 100 firms and individuals which will also face export restrictions.\nOthers target the state-owned operator of Mir, Russia's main payment system, which has become more prominent since Visa and Mastercard suspended their services there.\nCompanies involved in powering Russia's war effort, developing the country's future energy production and its co-operation with Iran over drones will also be hit.\nMore than two dozen entities outside of Russia - including people in China, the UAE, Vietnam and Liechtenstein - have also been sanctioned, accused of being connected to businesses that send materials to Russia's military.\nThe sanctions are unlikely to have an impact on Russia's economy. It is already the most sanctioned country in the world, and there are very few key entities or sectors that are not already subject to US and European restrictions.\nRussian banks and military-industrial enterprises have adapted, and developed workarounds to evade existing sanctions.\nUkrainian officials have published details of US and European microchips and other technology they have found in captured Russian drones. Many of these parts are imported to Russia from third countries such as China.\nIn a statement, President Biden said they new sanctions would \"ensure\" Russian President Vladimir Putin \"pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home\".\nThis latest package brings the number of entities sanctioned to over 4,000, and comes on the eve of the second anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\"Two years ago, he tried to wipe Ukraine off the map. If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going,\" Mr Biden said in the statement.\nJohn Kirby, the spokesperson for the National Security Council, told reporters on Friday that the administration had plans for further action against Russia, but needed to work with international partners and gain greater legal authority from Congress to implement it.\nThe EU also announced its 13th raft of sanctions on Friday, targeting nearly 200 companies and people accused of helping Russia procure weapons, or of involvement in kidnapping Ukrainian children - something Moscow denies.\nThey included 10 Russian companies and individuals involved in the shipping of North Korean armaments to Russia, including North Korea's defence minister.\n\"We remain united in our determination to dent Russia's war machine and help Ukraine win its legitimate fight for self-defence,\" said EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell.\nThe EU has now listed more than 2,000 individuals since the war started.\nIn response, Russia's foreign ministry said it had significantly expanded a list of EU officials and politicians banned from entering Russia.\n\"The European Union is continuing its fruitless attempts to put pressure on Russia through unilateral restrictive measures,\" it said in a statement.\nThe Russian president himself was sanctioned by the US, EU and UK days after the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. His assets were frozen and companies were banned from providing them with goods.\nPeople close to him, including his daughters, are also under sanctions.\nThe International Criminal Court served Mr Putin with an arrest warrant last year, alleging he was responsible for war crimes and focusing on the deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.\nMr Putin regularly praises the performance of the Russian economy in spite of international sanctions.\"We have growth, [the West has] decline,\" he said last month during a visit to the remote Russian region of Chukotka. \"They depend on us more than we depend on them.\"\nIts economy is around 1% larger than it was in February 2022.

    "The boss of Renault has said European manufacturers \"can't surrender\", despite Chinese and US brands leading the market for electric cars.\nThe company has just launched the new Renault 5, a futuristic EV with explicitly retro styling.\nSpeaking at the Geneva Motor Show, boss Luca de Meo admitted his company needed to catch up with overseas rivals.\nHe said he also wanted to prove that small electric cars could be popular and profitable.\nThe unveiling of the Renault 5 was one of the highlights of the Geneva Show, being held for the first time this year since the Covid pandemic.\nThe new car is a thoroughly modern electric model. Buyers will have a choice of batteries, offering 186 or 249 miles in range. The most powerful motor available produces 150hp.\nBut its appearance pays very obvious tribute to the original Renault 5 - a boxy but cheap runabout beloved by cost-conscious families in the 1970s and 80s.\nThere was a time when French roads were teeming with them. More than 5.5 million were sold. The \"Cinq\" became little short of a national symbol.\nThere was even a powerful rally-inspired turbo model to whet the appetite of teenage tearaways - though they could never have afforded the insurance.\nNow, at a time when manufacturers have generally been moving away from small cars in favour of larger, more expensive and more profitable SUVs, the company wants to go back to its roots.\n\"I think it makes sense to give people a chance to get into this new technology at an affordable price\", Mr de Meo told the BBC.\nBut affordability is relative. Electric cars still cost more to make than their conventional counterparts, and with the notable exception of Tesla, most manufacturers still lose money on them.\nThat makes them expensive. The new Renault 5 will cost from \u00c2\u00a325,000-30,000, but even so Mr de Meo admitted making a profit on it would be difficult.\n\"I think someone has to take the challenge\" he said.\n\"There is an opportunity with electric technology to reduce the size of the battery, especially for small cars.\n\"The battery is 40% of the cost. If you cut it by half\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I think you can do it.\"\nFor Renault, the new car needs to be a success. 15 years ago it was seen as a pioneer of electric motoring. Its Zoe model was once the best-selling EV in Europe.\nBut Mr de Meo admitted the company, and European manufacturers in general, had now fallen well behind the likes of Tesla and Chinese brands such as BYD.\nChina, he explained, had big advantages when it came to the mining and refining of raw materials, as well as the capacity to build batteries in giant so-called \"gigafactories\".\nClosing the gap, in particular on battery technology, would mean co-operating with Chinese firms, he said - something that had already started to happen.\n\"Many Chinese battery companies are building gigafactories in Europe. This is the form of cooperation we need to find\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you compete on one side, you co-operate on the other\", he said.\nHe remained confident Europe could catch up, he said.\n\"I'm there to do that\" he insisted.\n\"I'm one of the business leaders in the automotive industry, and we can't surrender!\"",

    "Anti-Muslim hate in the UK has more than tripled in the four months since Hamas's attacks, a charity has found.\nTell Mama has documented 2,010 Islamophobic incidents between 7 October and 7 February - a steep rise from the 600 it recorded for the same period the year previously.\nIt is the largest number over four months since the charity began in 2011.\nAnti-Muslim and antisemitic attacks have surged in the UK following the Israel-Gaza conflict.\nTell Mama, which describes itself as the leading agency on monitoring anti-Muslim hate crime, said slightly over half of the incidents in the past four months were cases of hate speech on social media.\nBut the charity also recorded cases of physical assault, abusive behaviour, threats and acts of vandalism, with the largest proportion of incidents - 576 cases - taking place in London.\nMuslim women were targeted in two out of every three recorded incidents, the charity added.\nIncidents recorded by the organisation include:\nTell Mama director Iman Atta told the BBC: \"Individuals walking down the streets are being targeted, harassed, households have been doodled with graffiti calling people 'killers', 'terrorists', 'Hamas sympathisers'.\n\"Anti-Muslim hatred and Islamophobia is gendered - it's misogyny as well as the visibility of that woman being either of an Asian background or wearing visible Muslim attires.\"\nReports of hate incidents in the UK have soared since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israel killing about 1,200 people and taking 253 hostage.\nIsrael responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 29,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nLast week, the Community Security Trust (CST), which tracks antisemitic incidents across the UK, said 4,103 attacks were recorded against members of the Jewish community in 2023.\nTwo thirds of these occurred on or after October 7 - marking an almost six-fold increase in cases compared to the same period in 2022.\n\"The war unfortunately is impacting our communities here in the UK,\" Ms Atta said.\n\"Muslim communities, Jewish communities are picking up the brunt of the war.\n\"Emotions are running very high, but one thing both communities agree on is that we all need to be able to go around our day-to-day basis feeling safe, feeling that we're not going to be targeted for who we are.\n\"A Muslim woman should not have to take off her headscarf just because she doesn't want to be targeted, nor a Jewish person should have to hide their Star of David because they don't want to be targeted.\"\nThe government said it condemned the recent rise in reported anti-Muslim hatred and antisemitism, adding there was \"no place for hate in our society\".\n\"We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law,\" a spokesperson said, adding that further funding had been made available to communities to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.",
    "Shamima Begum has lost an appeal against a decision to revoke her UK citizenship.\nThe Court of Appeal ruling means the 24-year-old must remain in Syria. The government stripped her citizenship on national security grounds in 2019.\nMs Begum left London nine years ago aged 15 to travel to Syria and join Islamic State group, or IS.\nThe ruling by three appeal judges was unanimous. It could still be challenged in the Supreme Court by Ms Begum.\nHer solicitor Daniel Furner said that her legal team was \"not going to stop fighting until she does get justice and until she is safely back home\".\nHowever the judges wholly dismissed all of Ms Begum's arguments - a highly significant rejection that could affect her ability to gain a full appeal at the Supreme Court.\nLady Chief Justice Baroness Carr said: \"It could be argued the decision in Ms Begum's case was harsh. It could also be argued that Ms Begum is the author of her own misfortune.\n\"But it is not for this court to agree or disagree with either point of view.\n\"Our only task is to assess whether the deprivation decision was unlawful. We have concluded it was not, and the appeal is dismissed.\"\nMs Begum's lawyers went to the Court of Appeal after losing a hearing last year . They argued that the Home Office's decision to remove her citizenship was unlawful, in part because British officials failed to properly consider whether she was a potential victim of trafficking.\nIn that hearing Sir James Eadie KC, for the Home Office, said the \"key feature\" in the case was national security.\n\"The fact that someone is radicalised, and may have been manipulated, is not inconsistent with the assessment that they pose a national security risk,\" he said.\nThe Court of Appeal ruling represents a substantial victory for the government and averts a potential legal crisis: were the decision to be reversed, home secretaries would in future need to balance national security considerations with questions of whether someone was a victim.\nResponding to the court's decision, the Home Office said it was \"pleased\" at Friday's ruling, adding that its \"priority remains maintaining the safety and security of the UK\".\nA spokeswoman for the prime minister said the government would \"always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security\", adding that it never took decisions to remove citizenship lightly.\nOutside court, however, Ms Begum's solicitors said that it was very likely they would ask the Supreme Court to get involved. A response however could take up to a year.\nGareth Peirce, of Ms Begum's legal team, said the UK was under a moral duty to take Ms Begum back, as other nations had with citizens found in Syria.\nMs Begum, born in the UK to parents of Bangladeshi heritage, was one of three east London girls who travelled to Syria in 2015 to support the IS group. She left with her friends Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase.\nMs Sultana is thought to have died when a house was blown up. The fate of Ms Abase is unknown.\nMs Begum lived under IS rule for more than three years. She married a Dutch member of IS, who is currently held in a Kurdish detention centre, and lived in Raqqa, once a stronghold of the group. She had three children, all of whom have died.\nShe was found in al-Roj camp in northern Syria in 2019 following the defeat of IS, and remains there to this day.\nHer lawyers say conditions in the camp have reached a \"critical point\", with \"near starvation\" and disease now seen daily.\n\"The fact of the matter is this - that Shamima, as with other British women and children, is arbitrarily detained in a prison camp in North East Syria,\" her lawyers said in a written statement on her behalf.\n\"It is not a refugee camp - those detained are unable to leave and the conditions have, with ever greater urgency, been categorised by every international body as well as by the UK courts in Shamima's case itself, as constituting torture and inhuman treatment.\"\nMs Begum has admitted knowingly joining a proscribed organisation. She said that she was \"ashamed\" to have done so and regretted it.\nThe Shamima Begum Story podcast is available on BBC Sounds and a feature length documentary of the same name, is on BBC iPlayer (UK only).",

    "Eight people, including police officers, are in hospital after a mysterious incident at Sweden's security service headquarters.\nAround 500 people were evacuated after workers reported an unusual smell.\nIt was first reported as a suspected gas leak, but security services have since said no gas was detected inside or outside the building.\nPolice are looking into the cause of the alert and have launched a preliminary investigation.\nLocal media reports earlier suggested sensors on the building's roof detected phosgene, but authorities have not confirmed this.\nPhosgene is used to make plastics and pesticides, and was responsible for the vast majority of chemical deaths during World War One.\nEmergency services launched a major operation after a call from the headquarters of Sapo, Sweden's security service, in Solna, just outside Stockholm city centre, at 12:30 (11:30 GMT) on Friday.\nThe nearest exit of a nearby motorway was closed and barriers were set up hundreds of metres around the premises. The building was partially evacuated.\nSix people were sent to hospital with reported breathing problems and two others admitted themselves. Among these were police officers who \"noticed a smell when they arrived at the scene\", police said.\nImages from the scene showed police officers wearing gas masks, and a helicopter circled the area. People in buildings nearby were told to shut their windows.\nSchoolchildren were kept indoors, a teacher told broadcaster TV4. People who live in the sealed-off zone were refused access to their homes.\nFirst responders ended their operation and removed barriers at about 16:30.\nThe incident came as Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson visited the capital of Hungary, the only Nato member that has not yet ratified Stockholm's accession to the alliance.\nThe Hungarian parliament is expected to approve Sweden's membership on Monday.",

    "Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has been hailed as a \"stunning recreation of a classic\" in the first reviews of the game.\nThe follow-up to 2020's Final Fantasy 7 Remake is the second part of a trilogy based on the beloved 1997 original.\nA PlayStation 5 exclusive, the game's been praised for improvements to its prequel.\nBut some reviewers have warned that it will take players dozens of hours to wade through the sheer amount of content in the game.\nWhat the Rebirth reviews say\nFinal Fantasy 7, released on the original PlayStation, introduced many westerners to Japanese role-playing games and gave gaming one of its most beloved casts of characters.\nAnd in Rebirth players once again resume the role of spiky-haired mercenary Cloud Strife and team-mates including Aerith, Tifa and Barrett.\nBloomberg's Jason Schreier called Rebirth a \"a stunning recreation of a classic\" , and \"a joy to play and look at, with a phenomenal soundtrack, confident writing and dozens of delightful activities\".\nIGN.com's Michael Higham gave the game nine out of ten , describing it as a \"best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenges\".\nGames Radar's Iain Harris said it was \"a second act that meaningfully improves the past and charts a course for a final act that promises plenty of twists and turns\".\nAnd in a four out of five review , Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale called Rebirth a \"toy box of a game that's messy but loveable\".\nSome reviewers complained that the game's performance mode, which favours smooth visuals over graphical detail, resulted in a \"blurry\" experience - a criticism levelled at the recent demo version until a fix was released.\nA whole new (open) world\nOne thing all reviewers agreed on is that FF7 Rebirth is a huge game.\nWhen BBC Newsbeat spoke to the series' lead developers just before last September's Tokyo Game Show , director Naoki Hamaguchi said the main game would take between 40 to 50 hours to complete.\nBut he told us adding in side quests and optional content would allow you to \"easily\" rack up more than 100 hours.\nReviews seem to confirm this, with IGN saying it took 82 hours to complete the game, taking in the main story and a large chunk of side content.\nAnd Video Games Chronicle, in its five-star review , called Rebirth \"a hugely enjoyable road trip you'll be playing for hundreds of hours\".\nThe game's vast range of mini-games are also likely to keep players busy and, in keeping with Final Fantasy tradition, there's an addictive card game - Queen's Blood - to keep you hooked for hours.\nSome sites, such as Eurogamer, said having so much stuff to do can make the game feel \"bloated\" at times, but it was a minor complaint for most.\nSpoiler warning\nThe original Final Fantasy 7 is famous for containing one of the most devastating twists in gaming history.\nWe won't spoil it here, but after 2020's Remake made some tweaks to the original narrative fans wondered whether the developers would leave that famous moment alone.\nUnsurprisingly, the developers have pleaded with reviewers and streamers to keep a lid on any spoilers, and none of the big sites are giving much away.\nWhile some critics were left unsatisfied or \"confused\" by the final hours of Rebirth, when the iconic scene is revisited, there was plenty of praise for the game's story, performances and attention given to each character's back story.\nWill FF7 Rebirth only be on PS5?\nConsole exclusivity's been a hot topic recently, with Microsoft revealing four Xbox-exclusive titles would come out on PS5 and Nintendo Switch.\nAnd PlayStation Studios' Helldivers 2 - released simultaneously on Sony's console and PC - has been a runaway success.\nBut as for the revamped FF7 games on Xbox? We're not holding our breath.\nProducer Yoshinori Kitase previously told Newsbeat Rebirth \"has been developed very much optimised for the PS5\".\nAnd while trailers for have stated the game could appear on other formats from 29 May 2024, that's more likely to suggest it will follow Remake and eventually come to PC.\nBut an open beta of Final Fantasy 14 has launched on Xbox this week - ten years after its initial release on PS4.\nYou won't have to wait a decade to play Rebirth, as it's out on PS5 next Thursday.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",

    "Journalist and presenter Kate McCann has revealed that she has been the victim of drink spiking while at a bar.\nThe Times Radio political editor said her drink was spiked by \"a group of men so brazen they didn't care who saw\".\nShe wrote on X, formerly Twitter, she had thought she would \"be okay as I'd only had one sip but sadly it was enough\". \"It was awful and I was lucky,\" she added.\nMs McCann shared her story after an investigation in the Sunday Times .\nShe said she still did not understand why the men, who were spotted by a colleague, did it but said it was \"so scarily common\".\nSpiking is the action of putting a drug into someone's drink, or into their body through another method, without their consent.\nWriting in Monday's Times , Ms McCann said she could not remember much after having her drink spiked while out with colleagues.\n\"I suddenly got very hot and it felt like my brain was moving at two speeds,\" she writes.\n\"I had enough presence of mind to know something was very wrong, but I couldn't get my arms or legs to move in the way I wanted.\"\nShe said she had managed to get an Uber ride home - although she does not remember it - and had woken up hours later on her bathroom floor.\nReplying to a user on X, Ms McCann said people \"get confused\" about spiking being similar to \"being too drunk\", and said it feels \"nothing like being drunk - even really really drunk\".\nIn December last year, the Home Office said the law would be \"modernised\" to make it clear that spiking is a crime.\nHowever, the law change stopped short of calls from some to make spiking a specific offence.\nBetween May 2022 and April 2023, the first year drink spiking data was collected, police received 6,732 reports of spiking, including 957 reports of needle spiking, according to figures from the National Police Chiefs' Council .\nThe figures cover England and Wales, and are likely low due to underreporting.\nMs McCann said she did not tell police when she had her drink spiked but now wished she had. \" Now that forces are collecting data properly it's really important to report it if this happens to you,\" she said.\nA report on spiking was presented to Parliament in December, following on from what it said was an increase in reported spiking incidents in autumn 2021.\n\"The greatest number of incidents occurred in university towns, coinciding with Freshers' Week and students returning to higher education following lockdown,\" the report said.\nAt the time minister for victims and safeguarding Laura Farris said spiking was \"an insidious and violating crime\" and that it could be \"traumatic and have long-lasting effects\".",
    "Grange Hill star Stuart Organ has died aged of 72, his representatives have confirmed.\nThe British actor was the longest-serving cast member on the children's TV drama, playing Mr Robson.\nOrgan, who started his acting career in Leeds in 1975, also appeared in the soap Brookside and Doctor Who.\nHis other credits include Casualty, The Bill and Holby City and films such as Those Glory Glory Days and Fork In The Road.\nThe actor \"died peacefully at home after a short illness\", it was announced on Friday.\nOrgan will be best remembered for his 15-year stint on the BBC's Grange Hill, where his character Peter Robson arrived as the head of PE in 1988, going on to take the headmaster role 10 years later.\nThe show, which was about life in a London comprehensive school, ran from 1978 to 2008 and made headlines for tackling big issues such as racism, drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, mental illness and HIV and Aids.\nThe actor decided to leave the series in 2003 after it was announced that production was moving to Liverpool.\nGrange Hill made household names of characters such as Zammo McGuire, played by Lee MacDonald, and Tucker Jenkins, played by Todd Carty.\nIn 2022, creator Sir Phil Redmond spoke about the show returning as a film.\nOrgan's other memorable roles include playing Kevin Cross in the Merseyside soap Brookside and Bazin in the Doctor Who plotline Dragonfire in 1987.\nHe began his acting career at Leeds Playhouse in 1975 in a performance of Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead, a spin-off of William Shakespeare's Hamlet.\nHis other theatre roles include An Englishman Abroad, where he played Guy Burgess in a 2003 production in York and Major Powell in the play Corpse, which he performed in Hornchurch in 2007.\nWhilst a younger audience may have not seen him act, they may have heard his voice elsewhere - he has appeared as the voiceover on cartoons and video games, such as Star Wars: The Old Republic.\nHe is also a familiar voice to London Underground passengers,  announcing stations, lines, late arrivals and telling users to mind the gap.",
    "Love Islander Georgia Steel says online trolling got so bad during her time in the All Stars villa that she's had to take a break from social media.\nHer account was run by her family while she was on the ITV show and they had to release a statement calling out \"vile threats\" they'd received.\nSince leaving the villa last week, the 25-year-old says she's had to step back from the apps for her mental health.\n\"I needed to take some time out to clear my mind,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.\n\"That's the best thing for my mental health and then I'll come back when I feel better, when I've decompressed over everything that's been going on.\"\nLast year, ITV introduced a social media ban after islanders were faced with online trolling.\nThat was reversed for the returning contestants, meaning friends and families could post on their accounts while they were in the villa.\nDespite receiving abuse, Georgia thinks it was the right decision.\n\"I'm already on social media and it's my way of life,\" she says. \"I don't think it's necessary to take that away from me.\"\nInstead, she feels more should be done to limit abuse.\n\"People can't be trolling anonymously,\" she says.\n\"People need to have a name to what they're saying and take a bit more responsibility.\n\"Because these are real people, even though you're on TV it is a real person and I think people forget that sometimes.\"\nMedia watchdog Ofcom received dozens of complaints about the latest series of Love Island and told Newsbeat the majority of them expressed concern for Georgia's wellbeing - although some also related to her behaviour towards other islanders.\nThe number was much smaller than during previous series, which have been known to attract thousands .\nConcerns mostly focused on the \"PDA awards\" episode where Georgia was shown appearing to mislead Callum Jones about her feelings for other islanders.\n\"There was obviously a lot of comments on social media,\" Georgia says. \"My family and friends had loads of things to read.\n\"I've been in the industry since I was 19, so they do know how it works, however, it's obviously awful to see and for me to have my family go through that, I just don't think it's OK.\"\nDuring the series, a post on Georgia's Instagram Story to her 1.7 million followers said some episodes had \"been difficult\" for her family to watch, \"but what's far worse is the hate Georgia is receiving online\".\nComments were turned off on her posts and although the feature has since been restored, anyone looking to comment is met with a message asking them to \"treat other people with respect\".\nITV says it has an \"incredibly thorough\" screening process that is \"constantly evolving\" to make sure islanders are able to cope with the pressures of the show and Georgia says the team has continued to be supportive.\nMore All Stars?\nCompared with her debut in 2018, the villa has been a totally different experience, Georgia says.\nAlthough islanders were reportedly paid far more than those entering the show for the first time, Georgia insists she did it for love.\n\"I had a lot of followers anyway so I didn't necessarily need the exposure,\" she says.\n\"I'm now 25, I'm actually in a place to meet someone. I've got all my ducks in a row except a boyfriend. So I thought, yeah, why not? Give it a go, we'll see what happens.\"\nShe ended up in a couple with Toby Aromolaran but they're said to be \"taking it slow\".\nJust over a million viewers tuned in for the Love Island All Stars final - a new format aimed at breathing life into the struggling series.\nThat figure represents a big drop from its record final in 2019, the fifth series that catapulted the likes of Molly-Mae Hague and Amber Gill to fame, which saw six million tune in.\nDespite falling audience numbers, Georgia thinks \"there could be another\" All Stars series.\n\"I know there was a lot of people that wanted to do the show that didn't really get the opportunity this time round,\" she says.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",

    "Continually seeing the same doctor at GP surgeries improves patient health and reduces workload, according to a study.\nUniversity of Cambridge researchers found patients who had long-term relationships with their doctor experienced a range of benefits.\nStudy co-author Prof Stefan Scholtes said this practice reduced future workloads by \"preventing revisits\".\nAbout 10 million GP consultations were analysed over 11 years in the research.\nThe study, jointly conducted by the Cambridge Judge Business School and INSEAD business school in Fontainebleau, France, found people waited on average 18% longer between visits, compared with patients who saw different doctors.\nLead author Dr Harshita Kajaria-Montag, who is now based at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University in the US, said: \"If you're a patient with complex health needs, you don't want to have to explain your whole health history at every appointment.\n\"If you have a regular doctor who's familiar with your history, it's a far more efficient use of time, for doctor and patient.\"\nThe benefits of the model known as continuity of care were especially apparent in older people and those with multiple chronic illnesses or with mental health conditions, according to the study published in the journal Management Science.\nThe research involved 381 practices in England using anonymised data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2017.\nThe data was limited to patients who had at least three consultations over the past two years.\nDr Victoria Tzortziou-Brown, vice-chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said \"continuity of care is highly valued by GPs and patients alike\" but family doctors were facing \"intense workload and workforce pressures\".\nShe said: \"Political agendas prioritising speedy access to GP services above all else... greatly limit the level of continuity we can offer.\"\nA fully-qualified GP is now responsible for 260 more patients than they were six years ago and \"makes guaranteed access to the same GP for every patient practically impossible,\" she added.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care was approached for comment.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "South Africa's battle to defeat rhino poaching has taken a turn for the worse with the numbers killed rising in 2023.\nLast year, 499 rhinos were hunted, an increase of 51 from the previous year, Environment Minister Barbara Creecy said.\nSouth Africa is home to most of the world's rhinos.\nThe country has some 2,000 black rhinos, considered to be \"critically endangered\", and around 13,000 white rhinos, classed as \"near threatened\".\nLooking back over 10 years, poaching has fallen sharply from 2014 but has increased more recently.\nRhino horns have been in huge demand in Asian states such as China and Vietnam, where they are used in traditional medicines.\nThe majority of animals killed last year were in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in KwaZulu-Natal province.\nThe Kruger National Park, which had previously been a hotspot for poaching, saw a reduction of more than a third in 2023.\nThe success in dealing with poaching at Kruger, the biggest game park in South Arica, had led to criminal groups moving elsewhere, Ms Creecy told journalists.\n\"The increase is very concerning,\" a spokesperson for the company that runs Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, Musa Mntambo, told the BBC.\nPoaching groups \"often struggle to spot rhino in the Kruger and so come here where they are more visible\", he added.\nLast year, the government allocated $2.1m (\u00c2\u00a31.7m) to improving fencing in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park.\nMr Mntambo said several other steps had been taken to fight poaching, including hiring more than a dozen more patrollers and acquiring a new surveillance helicopter.\n\"We have seen a decrease so far this year and we are hopeful that poaching will decrease in the coming months. By February last year we had 30 rhinos poached. This year we have 22.\"\nMs Creecy said her department had undertaken an extensive de-horning programme, making the rhinos less attractive to poachers.\nIt has also gone on an anti-corruption drive to prevent park officials from colluding with gangs.\nJamie Joseph, head of environmental group Saving the Wild, has been a long-time critic of the government's anti-poaching measures.\nShe predicted that poaching would continue to increase unless there was better intelligence gathering on the gangs.\n\"There is only one thing that will save that park and that is if they start running intel, set up ambushes and make arrests. Otherwise nothing is going to change,\" she told the BBC.\nBut Ms Creecy applauded the country's specialist policing unit, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, for its work in convicting 45 rhino poachers and traffickers last year.\nMore on rhinos and conservation:",

    "A former Sheffield cinema dating back over a century is to close immediately, it has been announced.\nThe decision to shut Abbeydale Picture House comes after a charity warned it was at risk of collapse if money was not secured for repairs.\nCreative Arts Development Space (CADS) said it had not taken the decision to close the building \"lightly\".\nThe charity, which had been trying to save the building, said it hoped \"one day to reopen\" it.\nThe building, on Abbeydale Road, was the largest and most luxurious cinema in Sheffield when it opened on 20 December 1920.\nIt had a ballroom and billiards hall in the basement, plus a lounge and caf\u00c3\u00a9 above the entrance and could seat 1,560 people in the cinema.\nIt closed in the 1970s and was used as a furniture showroom for several years, but was disused from 1991.\nIn the early 2000s, a restoration project started to bring the venue back into use and it reopened in 2008 with a new stage.\nHowever, two years ago an unsafe ceiling was found, which left the auditorium inoperable and in need of urgent repairs.\nIt was placed on the annual Theatres at Risk Register compiled by the Theatres Trust body in January.\n'Numerous challenges'\nCADS said despite \"exploring multiple avenues for funding and support, the necessary resources to secure and repair the building have remained elusive\".\nThe charity said the closure also included the Speakeasy Bar and Fly Tower- two venues operating in the building.\nSteve Rimmer, CADS board director and founder, said: \"Throughout this journey, we have faced numerous challenges in our quest to preserve this significant piece of Sheffield's heritage.\"\nHe said while the venue was closing, it was important to emphasise the charity was not leaving and its tenancy agreement remained in place.\n\"We are committed to continuing our mission of restoring the Abbeydale Picture House for future generations, ensuring its legacy and the cultural enrichment it brings to Sheffield.\n\"However, we can't afford to self-fund a loss-making venue at this time.\"\nMr Rimmer added: \"We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Sheffield community, our supporters, and partners who have stood by us.\n\"This chapter may be pausing, but our commitment to Sheffield's arts and cultural landscape is as strong as ever.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Network Rail has announced a recovery plan for the Reading-London Paddington route after months of poor performance.\nIt made national headlines when broken wires left 4,000 passengers stranded on trains for four hours at night, near Ladbroke Grove, on 7 December.\nMost passengers had to walk along the tracks to reach safety.\u00c2\u00a0There have also been a spate of failures, including broken rails and signalling faults.\nThe route is now set to be overhauled in three phases over 18 months.\n\"Our performance hasn't been good enough,\" admitted Network Rail's new route director Marcus Jones.\n\"We have been consistently letting down customers. They cannot guarantee a service every day.\"\nSteve Smith, of the Bedwyn Trains Passenger Group, described it as \"absolutely appalling\".\n\"Only one in three of our Paddington trains is on time,\" he continued.\n\"We have infrastructure failures, train failures, lack of trains and bad weather, causing flooding. Ultimately this is about lack of investment.\"\nFor the next four weeks, there will be fewer trains late at night, while engineers carry out remedial work to the tracks, signalling and overhead wires.\nFor the last couple of hours each evening, only two of the four tracks will be open.\nA six-month period of work to stabilise performance will follow, then a year-long programme to put long-term solutions in place.\nBeyond that, the overhead wires will be replaced in west London.

    "With the Republican primary nomination drained of much of its drama, political conversation on the right is shifting to who the clear front-runner, Donald Trump, might pick as his vice-presidential running mate.\nIt certainly was a topic of conversation at Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, over the past four days. Attendees at the annual gathering of right-wing activists, lobbyists and businesses - dominated in recent years by the Trump faithful - cast ballots in a straw poll for who should share the Republican ticket in November.\nThe results, which included 17 possible candidates, were announced on Saturday night:\nFive of the top six vote-getters addressed the Cpac audience on Thursday and Friday in what became a de facto auditioning session for the number-two nod. Mr Scott, considered to be one of the leading contenders, was campaigning for Mr Trump in his home state of South Carolina, which held its Republican primary on Saturday, and didn't make the trip to the convention.\nHere's a look at how some of the vice-presidential aspirants made their pitch at CPAC, and how they were received.\nTulsi Gabbard\nFormer Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has been on an eight-year political journey that took her from the Bernie Sanders left to Donald Trump's doorstep.\nAfter backing the democratic socialist Vermont senator against Hillary Clinton in 2016, she ran for president in 2020, championing liberal issues like government-run healthcare, free college tuition and gun control.\nNow she's singing Mr Trump's praises - and will be headlining a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser in March.\n\"This is a man who is a fighter,\" she said at her CPAC speech on Thursday evening. \"His strength and resilience can only come from one place... his sincere love and concern for the future of our country.\"\nShe also warned of a growing threat to American democracy - but the danger, she argued, came from the left's prosecution of Mr Trump.\nMs Gabbard is being talked up by Trump confidant Roger Stone and others on the right, who view her National Guard deployment to Iraq and her American Samoan ancestry, as well as her charismatic stage presence, all as ways to expand the former president's appeal in a general election.\nMs Gabbard's criticisms of an interventionist US foreign policy also fit well with Mr Trump's \"America first\" outlook.\nThe challenge for Ms Gabbard is her long record of support for liberal issues - and concerns that, as Mr Trump's VP pick, she could be an unreliable heir to his political movement.\nThat didn't matter much to CPAC attendee Joshua Mixon, a university student in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. \"She's not necessarily a full-on Republican, but she's just very smart,\" he said. \"She's very strong in her beliefs.\"\nKristi Noem\nIt's hard to develop a national profile as governor of a state with \"Dakota\" in its name. South Dakota's Kristi Noem managed a breakthrough, of sorts, back in 2020, when she pushed back against recommended Covid restrictions in her sparsely populated state.\nThe coronavirus pandemic may no longer be a salient political issue, but the connection she made with Mr Trump - hosting him for a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore in her state in 2020 - has kept her in the vice-presidential conversation.\nAt CPAC, Ms Noem highlighted her Covid record, boasting that she was the only governor \"who never once closed a single business\".\n\"We trusted each other,\" she said, \"and we got through our challenges together.\"\nShe also noted that she was one of the first public officials to endorse Mr Trump's 2024 campaign, taking a swipe at some of those who ran against him - and who could be her vice-presidential rivals.\n\"Why did all these other candidates get into the race?\" she asked. \"For themselves? For personal benefit? To get into the spotlight for a limited time?\"\nMs Noem wants to make sure that Mr Trump's supporters at CPAC - and, by extension, the man himself - know she's been with him from the start.\nUS Election Unspun - the new BBC newsletter\nIf you're in the UK, sign up here.\nAnd if you're anywhere else, sign up here.\nElise Stefanik\nSince being elected to Congress in 2014, Elise Stefanik of New York has moved steadily up the ranks of the House of Representatives. She's also moved steadily closer to Mr Trump's orbit.\nHer star turn came last year, when her aggressive questioning of three college presidents during a hearing about antisemitism on college campuses generated national headlines. Two of those presidents resigned after intense criticism of their response to her queries.\n\"I have a backbone of steel,\" Ms Stefanik said in her CPAC speech. \"Just ask the presidents of Harvard and Penn... the former presidents of Harvard and Penn.\"\nThis new prominence, along with a full-throated support of Mr Trump during his two presidential impeachments, has pushed her to the top of vice-presidential speculation.\nA slick video played before she took the stage at CPAC heavily featuring clips of Mr Trump prais",
    "Actress Rebecca Ferguson has said she once refused to work with a co-star who screamed at her on set and left her in tears.\nThe Swedish star told the Reign with Josh Smith podcast that she once worked with an \"absolute idiot of a co-star\".\nShe said she learned to stand up for herself after the star criticised her and she eventually asked for them to turn their back while she was acting.\nFerguson did not reveal the co-star's identity or gender.\nThe Dune: Part Two actress said the other actor was \"being so insecure and angry because this person couldn't get the scenes out\" and \"would literally look at me in front of the whole crew and say 'You call yourself an actor? This is what I have to work with?'\"\nShe added that she felt \"so scared\" about the confrontation which saw her being \"screamed at\".

I never want to see you again.\"\nWhen producers told her the star had to be allowed on set as they were \"number one\", Ferguson instead requested to act to the back of her co-star's head.\n\"I thought it shouldn't have to be that way, and I remember going to the director afterward and saying, 'What is happening?'\n\"The director said, 'You're right, I am not taking care of everyone else. I'm trying to fluff this person because it's so unstable.'\n\"And it was great from that moment but it took so long for me to get to that,\" she said.\nShe added that she has only become confident enough to stand up to this type of behaviour \"within my last 10 or 12 years, and I've acted since I was 16\".\nAlthough Ferguson did not name the co-star, she said it was not Tom Cruise who she starred alongside with in Mission Impossible, or Hugh Jackman, who played the main role in The Greatest Showman.\nShe added: \"Doesn't matter who it is, I'm gonna try and not give this away.\"\nDwayne Johnson, who appeared opposite Ferguson in 2014's Hercules, replied to a video clip of the interview on X, writing: \"Hate seeing this but love seeing her stand up to [it].\n\"Rebecca was my guardian angel sent from heaven on our set.

    "Police say they have \"grave concerns\" over a TV presenter and his boyfriend who disappeared in Sydney in suspicious circumstances.\nPossessions belonging to ex-Network 10 presenter Jesse Baird, 26, and Luke Davies, 29, were found on Wednesday in a bin in a suburb of the city.\nPolice have been trying to locate a third man - named by local media as a police officer who had dated Mr Baird.\nOn Friday morning, a man was taken into custody at a local police station.\nNew South Wales (NSW) Police have not confirmed if the 28-year-old - who handed himself in - is the man they were seeking to question over the disappearances.\nIt comes after officers searched a home in the Balmain area of Sydney on Thursday night, seizing a number of items.\nOfficers found blood and moved furniture at Mr Baird's home in the Paddington area, around 28km (17 miles) from Cronulla, the suburb where a worker found the couple's belongings in a bin.\nBlood-stained clothes, a phone and credit cards were among the items found.\nPolice believe the couple were in Paddington on Monday. CCTV footage obtained by 7NewsAustralia shows what it says appears to be the couple going into Mr Baird's flatshare.\nCCTV footage showing a white van in the area was also being looked at by police, the news outlet said.\nQantas flight attendant Mr Davies has not been in contact with his family or attended work since Monday, according to police.\nDet Supt Jodi Radmore said all lines of inquiry were being investigated and told reporters: \"We do believe, from the crime scene at Paddington and from property located at Cronulla, that there has been some sort of incident.\"\nShe added that had given the force \"great concerns for one, possibly both their safety\".\n\"Witnesses described a verbal argument,\" she continued, \"but it wasn't reported to police at the time ... it was only reported to police yesterday [Monday morning] during canvassing.\"\nNew South Wales Police are appealing for information.\nMr Baird had been a presenter and red carpet reporter on Network 10's morning show Studio 10 until the show was axed in December.\nQantas said it was providing support to Mr Davies' colleagues.\n\"Our thoughts are with family, friends and colleagues of our crew member at this very difficult time,\" the airline said in a statement.",

    "Michael Matheson has been given 10 more days to respond to the findings of the parliamentary probe which led to his resignation.\nThe former health secretary stood down earlier this month after racking up an \u00c2\u00a311,000 data roaming bill on his parliamentary iPad.\nHe said the fees were caused by his sons using the device as a hotspot to watch football while in Morocco.\nMr Matheson applied for an extension to respond to the report on 14 February.\nHe had been given the draft report by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) - the cross-party authority tasked with the running of the parliament - on 8 February and was initially given 14 days to respond before the final version was published.\nMinutes of a meeting of the SPCB last week, published on Thursday, show that the body had increased the time he had to respond by 10 days.\nThe minute noted the authority's \"responsibility to ensure that the member was afforded a fair process, including the opportunity to obtain advice if necessary and to ensure that the report was complete and accurate\".\nA spokesman for the Scottish Parliament said: \"For reasons of fairness to all, and confidentiality of process, we will not comment while the parliamentary investigation is ongoing.\n\"The SPCB remains committed to openness and transparency and will release all material it can, when it can, in line with its legal obligations.\"\nMr Matheson initially defended his position when news broke of the iPad issue last year - and had the backing of First Minister Humza Yousaf. He admitted that the bill had been caused by his sons - having previously claimed there was no personal use of the iPad during the holiday.\nBut earlier this month, Mr Matheson said in his resignation letter to the first minister he wanted to avoid the issue becoming a \"distraction\".\nInitially, he had sought to cover the cost of the bill through a mix of his office budget and parliamentary expenses, but eventually decided to pay it himself following a backlash.\nScottish Conservative Chairman Craig Hoy MSP accused Mr Matheson of \"trying to stall for time\".\nHe said: \"Michael Matheson should stop trying to hope this goes away, and accept the report's findings as quickly as possible, as well as any possible punishment that will be coming his way.\"",
    "A migrant who piloted a boat where four passengers drowned in the English Channel has been sentenced to nine years and six months.\nIbrahima Bah was convicted of manslaughter on Monday over the deaths of the migrants who were on a dingy he steered during an attempted crossing.\nThe judge sentenced Bah on the basis he is \"about 20 years old\".\nBah, whose exact age is in dispute, will serve two-thirds of his sentence in custody.\nHe will be detained in a Young Offenders Institution, until it is determined he has reached the age of 21, which is when he will be moved to adult custody.\nThe case is the first time a migrant who navigated an inflatable has been found responsible for harm caused to other occupants, the BBC's home and legal correspondent, Dominic Casciani, said.\nThe Senegalese migrant had claimed he was forced by violent smugglers to make the journey to the UK in December 2022.\nSentencing him at Canterbury Crown Court, the judge, Mr Justice Johnson, said the \"primary responsibility\" for the offences lay with people smugglers who had procured a \"wholly unsafe and unsatisfactory\" vessel.\nHe told Bah: \"What happened is an utter tragedy for those who died and their families. This is also a tragedy for you - your dream of starting a new life in the UK is in tatters.\"\nBah was found guilty by the jury by a majority of 10 to two on four counts of gross negligence manslaughter, which the CPS describes as where a death is a result of a grossly negligent act or omission on the part of the defendant.\nThe jury also found Bah guilty of facilitating a breach of UK immigration law.\nThe judge said the boat was a \"death trap\" and that passengers were aware of the \"obvious\" risk but \"freely and voluntarily embarked on the journey\", but that Bah bore \"high culpability\" for the offences.\nDuring a three-week retrial, jurors heard that Bah made the crossing in exchange for a free passage.\nBut Bah told the court he changed his mind about piloting the boat when he arrived at a beach and saw it was too small for the number of passengers.\nThe low-quality inflatable should not have held more than 20 people.\nBah claimed he was assaulted by smugglers and threatened with death if he did not take on the job.\nThe court heard that a number of migrants had described water reaching their knees within 30 minutes of leaving the French coast.\nDuncan Atkinson KC, prosecuting, said because he piloted the dingy he owed his fellow passengers a \"duty of care\".\n'Degree of coercion'\nMr Atkinson said Bah was not trained or licensed to lead the voyage and there was insufficient safety equipment such as life jackets and no flares or radio on board.\nJudge Johnson said he accepted there was a \"degree of coercion falling short of duress\" and that Bah had \"misgivings\" about the boat.\nLibby Clark, a specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: \"He could've turned back. That's what some of the migrants wanted to do.\n\"But Ibrahima Bah carried on. Those aren't really the actions of somebody who's acted under duress.\"\n'Last to leave'\nThe court heard that a crew on a British fishing boat came across the sinking boat and tried to rescue the passengers, with help from the RNLI, air ambulance and UK Border Force.\nJudge Johnson said: \"[The dinghy] was grossly overcrowded [and] you were travelling across the busiest shipping lane in the world, on a cold winter's night.\"\nHe said he had taken account of Bah's actions after \"disaster struck\" on the journey in his sentencing, including keeping the dinghy alongside the fishing boat.\nIn a police interview, Bah told detectives that a close friend, who was 18-years-old, was among those who had died, although his body has not been formally identified.\nThe judge said Bah was \"one of the last people to leave the dinghy\" and helped others, including his friend who had \"tragically died in front of your eyes\".\nA total of 39 survivors were brought to shore in Dover. The exact number of migrants who drowned is unknown, as it appears at least one person's body was believed to have not been recovered.\nThree of the four bodies that were recovered after the boat sank, including Bah's friend, have not been identified.\nOne adult male was identified as 31-year-old Ahmadi Herjatullah. from Afghanistan who was married with a daughter who was six-years-old at the time of his death.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "The mother of a man who took his own life says the NHS unit where he was treated is \"not a safe institution\".\nDespite Jayne O'Sullivan's 39-year-old son Dan telling a psychiatrist at a west London mental health unit of his plans to kill himself, he was allowed to leave and was later found dead.\nA coroner found Central and North West NHS Trust failings were a \"significant contribution\" to his death.\nThe NHS trust said it \"deeply regrets\" Daniel's death and had made changes.\nMrs O'Sullivan has been awarded compensation but says she still doesn't know why her son was released from the mental health unit at St Charles Hospital in Ladbroke Grove.\nWarning: this story contains details about mental health, addiction and suicide that some may find distressing.\nMrs O'Sullivan, who is originally from north London but is living in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, said her son had mental health problems for at least a decade, including episodes of paranoia.\nDan was diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder, but Mrs O'Sullivan explained he was \"in denial\" about his health and would self-medicate with drugs and alcohol.\n\"I was getting phone calls from him late at night, saying 'they're out to get me',\" she said, adding Dan would often stay overnight at her house or go abroad for a few days.\nWhen Dan returned from these trips, he would sometimes be admitted to hospital and treated with antipsychotics.\nAllowed to leave\nIn the month before Dan's death his mental health worsened and on several occasions he mentioned suicide.\nOn 13 March 2019 he tried to take his own life, until he was discouraged by a member of the public on Vauxhall Bridge in central London.\nPolice officers took him to A&E at Kings College Hospital and he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.\nHe was transferred and admitted to the mental health unit at St Charles Hospital on 19 March, where he remained under section.\nDuring an assessment, Dan said he planned to kill himself \"next Tuesday\", but the hospital's consultant psychiatrist decided to rescind Dan's section detention six days later - even though he maintained his delusional and paranoid beliefs were real.\nOn the next afternoon - a Tuesday - staff allowed him to leave for a short time to buy cigarettes. Dan never returned and wasn't reported as missing to the Met Police by staff until after midnight, even though he should have been back by 21:00 GMT.\nHe was found dead at Vauxhall Bridge at 05:30 the next day, 27 March 2019.\n'I wanted to vomit'\nMrs O'Sullivan said the first time she even heard her son had been sectioned was when officers knocked on the family's front door to inform them of his death.\n\"I wanted to vomit... I had dizziness, it was a completely out-of-body experience,\" she said.\nSeeking answers about her son's death, Mrs O'Sullivan attended Dan's inquest but was said she was left questioning the care he received.\n\"The notes say [the hospital psychiatrist] had spoken to Dan on the day he went missing and she felt that Dan was OK, but there was no evidence of any suicide risk assessment,\" Mrs O'Sullivan said.\n\"How can this happen? He was in a mental health unit where you'd hope they'd pick up on the risk. In my opinion it's not a safe institution.\"\nDuring three days of inquest hearings Mrs O'Sullivan said \"there was no acknowledgement of what I consider a heinous crime\".\nEventually, Mrs O'Sullivan hired Nicola Wainwright from JMW Solicitors to pursue legal proceedings against the NHS trust because she felt Dan \"hadn't been listened to in life and he was going to be listened to now\".\nIn a narrative conclusion in October 2022, coroner Christopher Williams said rescinding Dan's section order had been \"a missed opportunity to assertively treat his psychosis and drug use in hospital\", which \"made a significant contribution to his death two days later\".\nHe cited failures to update Dan's \"suicide self-harm risk assessment\", and to \"formulate a care and treatment plan identifying core treatment needs\".\n'We deeply regret his death'\nThe report noted the NHS's Serious Incident Investigation did not interview the nurse who reported Dan missing to police, nor did it look into the disappearance of a signing-out book at the hospital after his death.\nCentral and North West London NHS Trust spokesperson said \"We deeply regret the death of Mr O'Sullivan and the distress this has caused his family.\n\"Following this very sad incident we have made a number of changes to our adult mental health services in Kensington and Chelsea and many of these changes have been adopted across the trust.\"\nIn a seven-page response to the coroner's Prevention of Future Deaths Report, the trust said it had \"made a number of changes to the provision of adult mental health services\" including a new information recording system, staff training, and updated risk assessment and missing patient policies.\nResponding for the Department for Health and Social Care, mental health minister Maria Caulfield also expressed her sympat",
    "Desperate to escape Sudan's war, people have told the BBC how they have handed over their precious savings to unscrupulous people smugglers-cum-gold miners, to make a terrifying journey to Egypt.\n\"They left me and my dead mother in the desert,\" 25-year-old Salama, who made her first desperate attempt to cross the border with her family in August, told the BBC.\nLike all those interviewed for this article, her name has been changed for her safety.\nShe was travelling with her 65-year-old mother and four other relatives in the back of the smuggler's pick-up truck when it crashed, throwing her mother out of the vehicle.\nThey had been travelling for eight hours and stopped to sleep overnight before the accident happened.\n\"We kept trying to tell the driver to slow down,\" Salama said.\nBut the advice went unheeded and her mother died after hitting her head.\nThe smugglers refused to transport her dead body so bundled Salama, who was crying uncontrollably, along with the rest of the family and their belongings off the truck - and to their horror drove away without them.\nSalama had made the decision to leave her home in Omdurman - a city just across the River Nile from the capital, Khartoum - as the fighting was creeping ever closer.\nShe moved her family to the northern town of Gabgaba from where smugglers operate. It has been nicknamed \"Gabgaba Airport\" by locals because of the influx of those seeking an escape.\nThe conflict - a vicious power struggle between the military and a paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - erupted last April.\nIt has forced more than 10 million people from their homes, with an estimated 450,000 fleeing to Egypt.\nSalama, who is a widow with two children, said they could often hear gunfire in their neighbourhood.\n\"We had to leave. Our lives were in danger,\" she said.\nBefore she had set off with her mother, she had already organised for her children to escape across the border with other relatives using the desert-smuggling route as it had become \"impossible\" to get a visa to travel legally to Egypt.\nWomen and children used to be able to enter Egypt without a visa but with the war came new restrictions.\nThe smugglers are usually men who are involved in gold mining in the area, so know the tough desert terrain along the 1,200km (745-mile) border and have access to trucks.\nThey charged her $300 (\u00c2\u00a3235) per person for the crossing - money that she did not get back when she was abandoned in the desert.\nEventually, after hours of waiting by the side of the road with her mother's body and with little food and water, Salama managed to flag down a driver, who was travelling into Sudan with food and electrical goods.\nHe took the family to the northern Sudanese city of Abu Hamad, where they were able to bury Salama's mother.\nSalama's experience is not unusual - though people are reluctant to open up about their own journeys.\nHowever, those who agreed to talk to the BBC said accidents were common as the smugglers drive at high speeds to evade the authorities.\nIbrahim, a government employee from Khartoum who made it to Egypt last August, told the BBC a man he was travelling with broke his neck and died after the truck they were in hit a rock.\nThe smugglers insisted on leaving his body and burying it in the desert.\n\"Everyone was horrified. I stared at the unmarked grave as we drove away, while the women and children in the truck wept,\" Ibrahim said.\nRobberies are also common. Halima told the BBC about a frightening experience in December before their truck reached the border.\n\"We were attacked by four masked gunmen when our truck broke down. They fired gunshots in the air, slapped my daughter and stole our belongings,\" said the 60-year-old who had fled Gezira state after RSF fighters attacked her home.\nThe desert attackers were scared off when another car came along and luckily that driver agreed to help them and took them over the border.\nHalima said her 25-year-old daughter, a psychologist, was badly shaken by the incident - and died the day after their arrival in Egypt.\n\"She had a panic attack and couldn't breathe,\" she said, explaining that they could not get her medical aid in time.\nThe BBC has seen a copy of the death certificate, which cites respiratory problems as the cause of death.\nPeople the BBC spoke to said the activity of the smugglers has increased with prices going up by 200% since the RSF carried out attacks at the end of last year in Gezira, a state which had been a safe haven for those escaping the fighting in Khartoum.\nMost of the smugglers insist on payment via a banking app. Some people scrabble together their scant savings to make the payment or get the money from their relatives in the diaspora.\nThe BBC has contacted the Egyptian government to ask what it is doing to tackle the smugglers but has not received a response.\nSudan's consulate in Aswan in southern Egypt said it had launched a campaign to warn of the dangers associated with people smuggling.\n\"We are working wit",

    "When Alabama's Supreme Court defined frozen embryos as children, the shock and confusion was immediate. Major hospitals pulled fertility services and would-be parents scrambled for clarity on what would happen next.\nThe debate over reproductive rights in America has long been driven, in part, by opposition to abortion from Christian groups - but this ruling has divided that movement and ignited debate about the role of theology in US lawmaking.\nMargaret Boyce is soft-spoken, a private person, and certainly not - in her words - a \"crier\".\nShe had been taking fertility drugs for 10 months and was days away from her first appointment for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) when the justices of Alabama's top court upended her life.\nTheir ruling, which prompted many fertility clinics to pause their work, has left her turning to the Bible daily for comfort.\nThe 32-year-old and her husband have a young boy but, second time round, she is experiencing unexplained infertility. Building a family has always been the dream.\n\"I'm one of three. I feel like it's the greatest gift to give your child a sibling,\" she said.\n\"The journey to becoming parents is different for every single couple - mentally, emotionally and financially,\" she added, welling up.\n\"This ruling has added more unnecessary anxiety to something that is already so hard.\"\nFor a devout Christian like Margaret, the ruling - given its consequences for what she sees clearly as a process to create life - is even more difficult to comprehend.\n\"God,\" she said, \"tells you to go forth and be fruitful and multiply.\"\nIVF is a difficult and lengthy treatment, involving the fertilisation of a woman's eggs with sperm in a lab to create a microscopic embryo. The fertilised embryo is then transferred into a woman's uterus, where it may create a pregnancy - but a successful outcome is not guaranteed.\nEmbryos are often frozen or eventually destroyed as part of IVF, which accounts for around 2% of US pregnancies.\nThe Alabama court ruled that an existing law - wrongful death of a minor - covers not just foetuses in the womb, but embryos held in a lab or storage facility too.\nIt did not explicitly restrict or ban IVF, but it has still created deep uncertainty for clinics and medical workers who handle embryos and fear prosecution. In recent days the office of the state's attorney general said he had \"no intention\" of pursuing criminal charges against IVF clinics - but one clinic told the BBC this statement lacked detail and did not quell their fears.\nWhile the majority of the justices rooted their ruling in law, Chief Justice Tom Parker also had a higher authority in mind, repeatedly invoking scripture in explaining his decision.\nThe people of Alabama, he wrote in a concurring opinion, had adopted a \"theologically-based view of the sanctity of life\" in their state constitution.\nDelving into religious sources from classic Christian theologians like St. Thomas Aquinas and also a modern conservative Christian manifesto, he concluded that \"even before birth, all human beings have the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory\".\nSome anti-abortion groups celebrated the explicit use of scripture in Justice Parker's opinion to justify what for them was a momentous decision.\nTony Perkins, president of evangelical activist group the Family Research Council, described it as \"a beautiful defence of life\".\nBut the chief justice's theocratic justification has left Margaret puzzled. She doesn't believe in abortion but she also struggles to see a frozen embryo as a living person. For her, life begins with a heartbeat.\n\"Nobody understands more that an embryo is not a child,\" she said, before taking a pause, \"than the person yearning for that embryo to be a child.\"\nUS courts do sometimes make decisions that seem to be based on religious premises, said Meredith Render, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law.\nBut, she added, \"rarely do you see it as explicitly stated\" as in the chief justice's opinion.\nThe ruling was however \"not an outlier\" for a conservative court in a red state, said Kelly Baden, the vice president for public policy at the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion legislation across the US.\n\"We do see that many elected officials and judges alike are often coming at this debate from a highly religious lens,\" she said.\nWhile the Alabama state Supreme Court is not appointed by the US president, more than 200 judges were appointed by Donald Trump to federal courts during his four-year term, winning him lasting support from American evangelicals.\nDuring his presidency he was able to nominate three new justices to the nine-member Supreme Court - all of whom sided with the majority in striking down the 1973 Roe v Wade decision that had guaranteed a federal right to abortion.\nSince that decision in 2022 re-opened a national battle over reproductive rights, courts in Missouri have quoted Biblical teachings to justify restricting abortion rig",
    "The King has temporarily stepped back from his public duties while he is treated for cancer.\nBuckingham Palace has not said what type of cancer the 75-year-old has, but confirmed that it was not prostate cancer.\nThe King was recently treated for prostate enlargement.\nHow are the King's duties changing?\nIn a statement, Buckingham Palace said: \"Regrettably, a number of the King's forthcoming public engagements will have to be rearranged or postponed.\n\"His Majesty would like to apologise to all those who may be disappointed or inconvenienced as a consequence.\"\nIt added that he \"looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible\".\nThe King will continue with paperwork and private meetings as head of state.\nHis regular weekly meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will continue throughout the King's treatment, although they may not always be face-to-face.\nWhich Royals will step in for the King?\nWhile the King is recovering, the Queen is continuing to attend public engagements.\nIf it became the case that the King was not able to carry out his official duties for a temporary period, two or more members of the Royal Family would be appointed as Counsellors of State, to act in his place.\nThey could include the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal and the Duke of Edinburgh.\nWhat does the King do?\nThe King is the UK head of state, but his powers are largely symbolic and ceremonial. He remains politically neutral.\nHe receives daily dispatches from the government in a red leather box, including briefings ahead of important meetings, or documents needing his signature.\nThe prime minister normally meets the King on a Wednesday at Buckingham Palace.\nThese meetings are completely private, and no official records are kept of what is said.\nThe King also has a number of official parliamentary roles:\nThe monarch also leads the annual Remembrance event in November at the Cenotaph in London.\nThe King hosts visiting heads of state, and regularly meets foreign ambassadors and high commissioners.\nIn the first year of his reign, Charles visited a number of countries, including Germany , France and Kenya.\nCharles is also head of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 independent countries spanning 2.5 billion people.\nHe is head of state for 14 of these, known as the Commonwealth realms, as well as the Crown dependencies - the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.\nThe Queen undertakes her own public engagements on behalf of the 90 charities she supports.\nWho else is in the Royal Family?\nHow does succession work and who is King Charles's heir?\nThe order of succession sets out which member of the Royal Family takes over as monarch when the existing one dies or abdicates. First in line - the heir to the throne - is the monarch's eldest child.\nSons no longer take precedence over their older sisters.\nKing Charles's heir is his elder son, the Prince of Wales.\nWilliam's eldest child Prince George is second-in-line to the throne, and his daughter Princess Charlotte is third. Her younger brother Prince Louis is fourth and Prince Harry is fifth.\nWhere does the Royal Family get its money?\nThe Royal Family receives an annual payment from the taxpayer, known as the Sovereign Grant, which is used to pay for official expenses, such as the upkeep of properties and staff costs.\nThe amount is based on a proportion of the profits of the Crown Estate, a \u00c2\u00a316.5bn property business owned by the monarch but run independently.\nThe Sovereign Grant is worth \u00c2\u00a386.3m for 2023-2024, as it was in 2021-2022 and 2022-23, although the Royal Family's total spending was more, with the difference covered by reserves.\nTo keep the annual payment at the same level of \u00c2\u00a386.3m in 2024-2025, the grant will be a smaller percentage of Crown Estate profits, which have been boosted by six new offshore wind farms.\nHowever, if Crown Estate profits continue to grow as predicted, even under the reduced formula, the amount given to the Royal Family is expected to increase substantially in 2025-2026 and 2026-2027.\nThe King also receives money from a private estate called the Duchy of Lancaster, which is passed down from monarch to monarch.

    "The woman credited as the \"first black matron\" in the NHS has had her achievement marked with the first official blue plaque outside London.\nDaphne Steele has been honoured at the former St Winifred's maternity home in Ilkley, West Yorkshire.\nOriginally from Guyana, Ms Steele arrived in the UK in 1951 and enrolled on a nursing course in south London.\nHer son Robert Steele said she would be \"speechless\" to see that a blue plaque had been dedicated to her.\nThe plaque was unveiled by Lord Parkinson, arts and heritage minister, as part of a roll out of the official Historic England scheme.\nIt reads: \"Daphne Steele. 1927-2004.

Is this something I can watch? Is it rude?\"\nHe said it made him realise he was \"not alone\".\n\"It's not just me, and there is a world out there that is accepting with people that understand and are going through what I'm going through,\" he added.\nMr Cromwell said the series was like \"an education\".\n\"A lot more friends and acquaintances started to come out and felt more comfortable and confident, including myself, to be more open about who we were, what we liked and not to feel ashamed.\n\"It also got people to ask genuine questions and discuss and actually find out what it was like to be LGBTQ+. It was a game changer.\n\"Back when Queer as Folk had come out there was nothing at all in Newport to do with LGBTQ+, and if it was it was underground, it was a huge risk to come out and pretty scary.\"\nHe said the show \"normalised\" being gay.\n\"Russell T Davies literally saved lives with this show,\" he added.\n'Incredibly daring'\nTV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan said he did not think another broadcaster would have aired the show at the time.\n\"Channel 4 has a legacy of doing shows that serve underserved audiences,\" he said.\n\"It was one of the shows that paved the way for a lot we have today.\n\"It was incredibly daring, as it depicted lives that hadn't been written before.\"\nSince Queer as Folk, Russell T Davies has gone on to write numerous series with LGBTQ+ storylines - including Cucumber and It's a Sin.\nThe Welsh screenwriter said in an Instagram post on Friday to mark Queer as Folk's 25th anniversary that the series had \"changed [his] life\".",

    "The sea of chanting, nearly-naked men tussle, push and shove towards the shrine. \"Washoi! Washoi!\" they yell - let's go, let's go.\nIt is scene that has barely changed in the 1,250 years the Hadaka Matsuri, or the Naked Festival, has been taking place at the Konomiya Shrine, in central Japan.\nBut this year there is a change - a big one.\nAway from the men's huddle, a group are about to become the first women to ever take part.\nThe women gathered here know they are making history. Finding room in traditionally male-dominated spaces is difficult anywhere, but in Japan - which last year ranked 125 out of 146 on the World Economic Forum's gender gap index - it is particularly hard.\nNot that they weren't always there.\n\"In the background, women have always worked very hard to support the men in the festival,\" explains Atsuko Tamakoshi, whose family has been working at the Konomiya festival for generations.\nBut the idea of actually taking part in the festival - which sees the men attempt to drive away evil spirits, before praying for happiness at the shrine - seems to have never come up before.\nAccording to Naruhito Tsunoda, there has never been an actual ban. It's just that no one had ever asked.\nAnd when they did, the answer was easy.\n\"I believe the most important thing is for there to be a fun festival for everyone. I think God would be happiest about that too,\" he told news agency Reuters.\nNot everyone in the community was as accommodating though.\n\"There were many voices that were concerned (about us taking part) - saying, 'What are women doing in a men's festival?', 'This is a men's festival, it's serious',\" Tamakoshi, a 56-year-old grandmother, explains.\n\"But we were all united in what we wanted to do. We believed that God would watch over us if we were sincere.\"\nThe women waiting for their turn are indeed sincere. What they are not is naked.\nInstead many are wearing \"happi coats\" - long, purple robes - and white shorts, as opposed to the men's loincloths, while carrying their own bamboo offerings.\nThey won't be part of the big scramble which accompanied the men's rush to the shrine, or the clambering over one another to touch the Shin Otoko, or the 'male deity' - a man chosen by the shrine. Touching him, as the tradition goes, is meant to drive evil spirits away.\nIt doesn't take away the significance of this moment.\n\"I feel that times have finally changed,\" Yumiko Fujie tells the BBC. \"But I also feel a sense of responsibility.\"\nThese women, however, are not just breaking gender barriers with their participation. They are also keeping the tradition alive.\nThis week, another naked festival - held at Kokuseki Temple in Japan's north - said this would be the last one they would hold. There simply were not enough young people to keep the festival going.\nJapan has one of the fastest ageing populations on earth. Last year, for the first time, more than one in 10 people were aged 80 or older. Meanwhile, its birth rate stands at just 1.3 per woman, with only 800,000 babies born last year.\nThe moment has come for the women to make their way to the shrine.\nThey stand in two parallel lines and carry the long bamboo sticks wrapped in intertwined red and white ribbons.\nAtsuko Tamakoshi is leading the way - blowing her whistle to prompt the rhythmic chant they've heard the men say for decades.\n'Washoi Washoi,\" the women shout.\nThe women focus on the movements and speed which they've practiced for weeks. They know they have to get this right.\nAware that the eyes of the media and the spectators are on them they're also smiling a mix of nerves and excitement.\nThere are supportive cries from the watching crowd, some shouting \"Gambatte\" or 'keep going!', as they push through the freezing temperatures.\nThey enter the Konomiya Shinto shrine's courtyard and, like the men, they're sprayed with cold water. It seems to energise them even more.\nAfter their offering is accepted, the women end the ceremony with the traditional salutation of two bows, two claps and one final bow.\nAnd then, the enormity of the moment sets in. The women erupt into cheers, they jump around and hug each other crying. \"Arigatogozaimasu! Arigato!\" Thank you! Thank you! They say to each other and the crowd now applauding them.\n\"I got so teary,\" Michiko Ikai says. \"I wasn't sure I could join, but now I feel a sense of achievement.\"\nAs they make their way out of the shrine, the women are stopped by members of the public who want to take pictures with them and media outlets who want to interview them. They happily oblige.\n\"I've done it. I'm so happy,\" Mineko Akahori tells the BBC. \"I'm really grateful that as a woman, I could participate for the first time.\"\nHer friend and teammate Minako Ando adds that simply \"becoming the first to do something like this is just great\".\n\"Times are changing,\" says Hiromo Maeda. Her family has been running a local inn which has hosted some of the male festival-goers for the last 30 years.\n\"I think our prayers and wishes are the sam",

Female civilians and soldiers would be freed first.\nIn return, around 400 Palestinian prisoners, some of them convicted of serious terrorist offences, would be released from Israeli jails.\nIsraeli soldiers might move away from some of Gaza's most populated areas, and some of the 1.8 million Palestinians displaced by the fighting since October might be able to return to homes in the north.\nBut with talks still going on in Qatar this week - where Egyptian and Qatari mediators are shuttling between Israeli and Hamas delegates - it is clear that most issues are still up in the air.\nReports suggest that there is still wrangling over the number of Palestinian prisoners released for each Israeli hostage.\nNor is there yet thought to be agreement on the redeployment of Israeli soldiers or the return of Palestinians to their homes.\nBut Haim Tomer, a former Mossad chief of division, with experience of previous negotiations, told me he was optimistic.\n\"I think that we are pretty close,\" he said.\n\"I'm not saying that for sure we will see the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. But I think that the negotiation is getting forward.\"\nHe cited comments by the Qatar-based leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, who gave the first oblique hint on Wednesday that the group might be softening its position on a deal.\n\"Any flexibility we are showing in the negotiations,\" he said in a televised address, \"is to protect the blood of our people and to put an end to their huge pains and sacrifices in the brutal war of extermination against it.\"\nMr Haniyeh went on to say that Hamas was ready to keep fighting if necessary, and he urged Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem to defy Israeli restrictions and march on Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\nThe reference to \"flexibility\" indicated that Hamas might be reconsidering demands - a complete end to the fighting and the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip - which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called \"delusional.\"\nBut Hamas has yet to respond formally to the proposals drawn up in Paris.\nIt is also not known what Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, thinks about the deal.\nHe was last filmed in an underground tunnel, somewhere underneath Khan Yunis or Rafah.\nHis guerrilla army is slowly being annihilated above him and the Israeli government has vowed to capture him.\nIsraeli officials have suggested that Mr Sinwar's authority has been severely eroded by five-and-a-half months of crushing bombardment and the deaths of tens of thousands of his people.\nSuch reports are hard to verify, but one thing is certain - it is harder and harder to communicate with the man who launched the attacks of 7 October.\nMeanwhile, the families and friends of the remaining hostages are on the road. They say they will reach Jerusalem on Saturday.\nWill good news be waiting for them when they get there?",
    "A fundraiser to help a shop worker who was attacked with an axe by two robbers has raised over \u00c2\u00a35,000.\nThe victim was taken to hospital with serious injuries after the incident at Chesham Bois Store, Buckinghamshire, on Thursday.\nThames Valley Police have appealed for witnesses and information.\nMarkus Green, the shop's manager, thanked the community for their support and said the incident was unusual.\nPolice said men entered the store on Bois lane at about 17:30 GMT and one was carrying an axe.\nAfter making threats, one of the the men walked behind the counter towards the till and hit the shop worker on the head with the back end of the axe causing \"significant injuries\", they added.\nMr Green, 54, said: \"It is a clich\u00c3\u00a9 to say it doesn't happen here but it really doesn't.\n\"It is a nice lovely village, we have a great community, and we're all shocked and saddened by what happened.\"\nHe said customers sending supportive cards and starting an online fundraiser \"has really floored us\".\nHe added: \"Everyone in the community is affected, a lot of people are deeply saddened and moved by this.\"\nThe shop worker is now recovering at home after being released from hospital on Monday.\nThe incident came after a robbery took place in Amersham on Wednesday.\nThames Valley Police said a staff member had been threatened with a knife before number of items were stolen.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "The bones of more than 140 people have been discovered close to where a medieval abbey stood several hundred years ago in County Antrim.\nThe remains - discovered at the end of last year in Carrickfergus - were located close to what was once the 14th century Woodburn Abbey.\nMade up of both complete skeletons and partial remains, archaeologists say they were mainly men.\nSome women and infants were also found.\nBelfast-based Gahan and Long Archaeological Services were initially called in to the site as part of the planning process for a new retail store to be built in the town.\nAfter grave cuts and bone fragments were discovered, the excavation site was extended, revealing the full scale of the remains.\nA 10-week excavation of the site finished on Friday.\nTeams hope that a post-excavation report - including work by an osteoarchaeologist - will yield more information.\n\"That will tell us the age of the individuals and their sex,\" Chris Long, of Gahan and Long Archaeological Services, said.\n\"We can identify diseases that they may have had, we will be getting radiocarbon dates for them, and we might be able to do other analysis that may tell us the individuals' ethnic origin as well.\"\nIt is still not know what era the remains belong to.\n\"I think they are probably 14th or 15th century, but we don't know,\" Mr Long said.\n\"The carbon dating should tell us.\"\nCarrickfergus medieval history\nThe excavation was carried out on a site adjacent to the former Woodburn Abbey.\nBuilt in 1326 by a religious order known as Premonstratensians, the abbey replaced another, original priory.\nWoodburn was dissolved in 1542, when the abbot and community retired to Islandmagee, and the building was partially demolished from about 1558.\nMr Long said the discovery is significant in \"providing further evidence of the medieval history of Carrickfergus\".\n\"No one knew where the [Woodburn] abbey was exactly. So while we have not found the abbey structure itself, we've found the graveyard that would have been right beside it,\" he said.\n\"The vast majority [of remains] are buried in the Christian tradition of east-west orientation, but some later burials have been deposited north-south.\n\"This may reflect the burial of executed criminals from nearby Gallows Green, who would have been denied a full Christian burial.\"\nFollowing further analysis, the remains will be reburied at a location which has yet to be determined.",

    "Former England striker and broadcaster Eni Aluko has criticised Elon Musk's X social network for allowing people to \"vomit their hatred unchecked\".\nAluko, who faced a wave of abuse after ex-footballer Joey Barton attacked her punditry, told the BBC that black women are being systematically targeted.\nThe BBC tracked down one of the trolls motivated by Barton's posts.\nHe said he shared hateful comments about women such as Aluko because they are \"just an easy target\".\nSpeaking exclusively to BBC Radio 4's Why Do You Hate Me? podcast, Aluko said she had repeatedly reported Barton's posts to X, formerly known as Twitter, but it has taken no action.\nShe said: \"Online abuse from someone with millions of followers feels like the world's caving on you.\"\nX did not respond to requests for comment. The social media company says publicly it does not allow \"direct\" attacks on the basis of race or gender. It says it is \"committed to combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance\".\nJoey Barton also did not respond to points raised by the BBC.\nBarton had posted repeatedly about Aluko, triggering this abuse, after her coverage of an FA Cup match in January. The first of his posts said she and another female pundit, Lucy Ward, were the \"the Fred and Rose West of football commentary\", referring to the Gloucestershire serial-killer couple.\nAluko played for Chelsea and England, scoring 33 international goals in 102 games before retiring in 2020. She now has an established broadcasting career. But her success has been accompanied by a wave of hate on social media.\nThe day after Joey Barton began his attack on her, she said the online response made her afraid to leave her house.\n\"I started to get quite anxious because you get that feeling of being in a fishbowl. Everybody is sort of thinking, talking about you and reading the horrific stuff that's been said about you,\" Aluko said.\n\"I'm not going to leave my house. I'm going to disguise myself when I go and get milk from the supermarket. Why should I have to do that? But this is the real life impact of online abuse and nobody's stopping it.\"\nAluko's employer, ITV, issued a statement condemning the abuse, but it continued to escalate. Some of it mentioned her family and details about where they live.\nAluko is now bringing a libel claim against Barton over his posts about her and her family.\nThe posts from Barton triggered a wave of hate, activating lots of other users who target women in public life with angry comments. The messages they sent often began with a comment about football, but quickly moved to personal attacks - frequently about gender and race.\nExamining the messages she received, I have found posts that were both racist and misogynistic - using gendered slurs, threatening violence and sharing monkey emojis.\n\"It's an attempt to really project inferiority on women and on black people. Because it's not just specific to football, right? This is a generic experience,\" Aluko said.\n\"You might have a black woman in a position of power and influence. The minute she gets something wrong, it confirms that she was never meant to be there in the first place.\"\nAluko said X gives racism and misogyny greater reach and does not tackle hatred.\nJoey Barton's posts were given more prominence by X because of his blue tick. This used to be a free feature to verify users' identities, but now has to be paid for and means the social network's algorithms promote those users' content more.\nOther smaller accounts then appeared to be emboldened by Barton's posts, sending out explicitly abusive messages to Aluko.\n\"This is a societal issue where we have a platform [X] that is allowing people to vomit their hatred unchecked,\" she said. \"And then on top of that, I think there is an intention to monetise and incite more hatred to promote a podcast.\"\nAluko was referring to Joey Barton's recently launched podcast, but she also believes there are other media figures targeting women for abuse online to grow their profiles.\nInfluencer Andrew Tate, for example, has racked up millions of views and followers by promoting a lavish lifestyle, and in his case, violence against women. He is currently being investigated for rape and human trafficking in Romania, which he denies.\n\"I see now there's a glorification of men that hate women. That's really dangerous,\" Aluko said.\nI tracked and messaged some of the accounts that began abusing Aluko after Joey Barton's posts.\nOne person behind an anonymous account agreed to speak to me in person. We're calling him James. He's in his early 60s and told me he moved from London to the countryside over a decade ago and has recently retired.\nHe asked me and my team to meet him in a car park and then we drove to an office located near a farm.\n\"Please don't think I'm anti-women because I'm not, you know?\" he told me. But just moments earlier he had said, in reference to female pundits: \"No-one wants to know what a woman's got to say.\"\nJames is particularly bothered",
    "Were it not for a nearby sign, passers-by would have no clue what once stood on a grassy spot in Berkshire.\nBeside an arrow pointing to a campus gym, another points to the Imperial College Reactor Centre in Ascot.\nWhile the sports building is clearly visible, all that stands in front of it now is an open field.\nBut for almost half a century, the patch of grass - not far from Ascot's world-famous racecourse and Legoland - was home to a nuclear reactor.\nIt played a vital role in supporting the training of nuclear scientists who would help design Britain's first generation of power-generating reactors.\nNow, after 10 years' work, it has become the first civil nuclear site in Britain to be fully decommissioned - the point where regulators have been able to revoke its licence and end the strict controls imposed to protect the public.\n\"There's no trace of any contamination or radioactivity on the site,\" said Ross Manson, Imperial College's radiation protection manager.\nReadings taken on site show nothing more than background levels of radioactivity, meaning it has been returned to its original state before the reactor was built and \"went critical\" in 1965.\n\"It can be used as a playing field by staff and students, entirely oblivious to its past nuclear history,\" said Mr Manson.\nIn fact, except the sign, all that remains is the reactor's control desk, now on display in a nearby building on the campus.\nWith its mass of warning lights, dials and switches, it has been compared to the original console on Doctor Who's Tardis. Both were designed at about the same time but while the Tardis changed down the years, the reactor console did not.\n\"It operated perfectly successfully, perfectly safely, throughout its life and, indeed, although the technology is old, it's reliable,\" said Trevor Chambers, the former head of the reactor centre who also oversaw its decommissioning.\nIn fact, the entire site changed little - other than the addition of some extra research buildings - until after the 9/11 terror attack in the US.\nConcerns that nuclear sites could be potential targets saw it being protected by what Mr Chambers describes as a \"Jurassic Park\"-style security fence, truck-proof concrete bollards and security bars on the windows.\nIt was the waning popularity of nuclear power in Britain that finally put paid to the site a little over a decade later.\n\"It was one of the facilities that were built in the early 1960s to support the expanding UK nuclear programme,\" said Mr Chambers.\n\"It could plug straight into a university campus for research to support all of the new reactor designs, which the UK were producing themselves.\"\nThe site itself never generated any electricity and was relatively small. Material could be inserted into the reactor core and then tested in an adjacent laboratory.\nLike in much of the world, by the start of the new century the view in Britain of nuclear as a reliable source of clean energy had changed following events like Three Mile Island in the US and Chernobyl, in what was then the Soviet Union.\n\"By 2012, the industry in this country was contracting; we certainly hadn't built any new reactors in this country since the 1980s,\" said Mr Chambers.\nWith demand on the site falling, the decision was taken to shut the reactor down and decommission the site.\nThat presented its own problems. Because of its small scale, the reactor had never had to be refuelled, so the first task was to design a system to remove the fuel remotely. A bespoke flask was also needed to transport the radioactive material from the site, under the Heathrow flightpath.\nThe work even had to take account of a badger sett alongside the reactor and research buildings.\nBut now, the UK is looking again towards nuclear as a source of electricity as it tries to decarbonise power generation. One site is under construction at Hinkley Point in Somerset and another is proposed for Sizewell in Suffolk.\nStudents wanting to perform research, such as that carried out in Ascot, now have to travel to sites in France and Australia.\nImperial College is one of a number of universities still running nuclear postgraduate courses.\n\"One of the things that the nuclear industry is trying very hard to do is to actually increase the numbers of students, at all levels,\" said Mr Chambers.\n\"Simply because we will need a lot of professional young people coming into the industry, fully trained, in order to operate the new reactors when they're online, which is not so very far away.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "Lord Jacob Rothschild, the financier and member of the Rothschild banking family, has died at the age of 87.\nIn a statement on Monday, his family called Lord Rothschild \"a towering presence in many peoples' lives\".\nHis career began at the family bank, NM Rothschild & Sons, before starting his own wealth management fund. He was also known for his philanthropy.\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair paid tribute to his \"dear friend\" describing him as a \"wonderful human being\".\nBorn in Berkshire in 1936, Lord Rothschild was educated at Eton College and went on to study history at Christ Church, Oxford.\nHe joined the family bank in 1963 but left in 1980 after falling out with his cousin Sir Evelyn de Rothschild.\nHe went on to build his own financial empire in the City of London, founding investment trust RIT Capital, which he chaired until 2019.\nThe Rothschild family has an estimated fortune of about \u00c2\u00a3825m, according to last year's Sunday Times Rich List.\nLord Rothschild was described as \"a superbly accomplished financier, a champion of the arts and culture, a devoted public servant, a passionate supporter of charitable causes in Israel and Jewish culture, a keen environmentalist and much-loved friend, father and grandfather,\" in a statement released by his family.\nLord Rothschild also held roles including deputy chairman at BSkyB Television, director of RHJ International, now known as BHF Kleinwort Benson Group, and was a member of the council for the Duchy of Cornwall for the then-Prince of Wales.\nSending his condolences to the Rothschild family, Sir Tony Blair said he would miss his friend immensely.\n\"He was of course a towering figure in Britain's Jewish community but his impact was global in his support for great causes, including in the arts and the environment, and in his tireless work to advance peace in the Middle East.\"\nThis support included chairing the National Lottery Heritage Fund and he was a longstanding patron of the National Gallery, of which he was chair of its board of trustees between 1985 and 1991.\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the National Gallery posted that it was saddened to hear of his death.\n\"Jacob Rothschild was a businessman, entrepreneur, philanthropist and cultural leader.\n\"Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones.\"\nLord Rothschild was married to Lady Serena Rothschild for more than 50 years until her death in 2019. They had four children.\nThe Rothschild banking family traces its roots back to 18th Century Frankfurt, from where family members moved to cities across Europe to build out banking businesses.\nIn 1815 the bank made a fortune when Nathan Mayer Rothschild bought British government bonds in anticipation of Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.\nLord Jacob Rothschild's cousin Sir Evelyn de Rothschild was chairman of NM Rothschild between 1976 and 2003, and was said to have advised Queen Elizabeth II on financial matters.",
    "Fixing environmental damage at a large illegal dump site in County Londonderry could cost up to \u00c2\u00a3700m.\nThe figure is contained in 2022/23 accounts from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) which have now been published.\nThey estimate a cost range of between \u00c2\u00a317m and \u00c2\u00a3700m.\nExperts say the Mobuoy site may contain 1.6m tonnes of waste including construction and domestic waste.\nThe contaminated Mobuoy dump is beside the River Faughan, which supplies a significant proportion of Derry's drinking water.\nIt was closed in 2013.\nDaera Minister Andrew Muir told the Assembly at his first question time there was \"no agreed preferred option\" for remediation of the site.\nBut the comptroller and auditor general to the Assembly disagrees.\nA note in the annual accounts from Dorinnia Carville says that \"conditions are met for the costs [of remediation] to be accounted for\" and that a \"preferred option\" of \u00c2\u00a3107m is deemed a reliable estimate.\n'Disagreement'\nBut including that figure would have resulted in a departmental overspend of more than \u00c2\u00a389m.\nDisagreement between the department and the auditor general resulted in publication of the annual accounts report being delayed until now.\nWithin the document, Daera says it will \"reassess the Mobuoy position\" in the departmental group financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2024 and \"will ensure\" engagement with the audit office at a much earlier stage.\nIt is subject to extensive environmental monitoring, including water testing due to its location by the River Faughan.\nIn March 2023, a number of options for remediation of the site were presented by a team of consultants appointed by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA).\nThey included removing some waste and capping large areas of the site.\nSDLP assembly member Mark Durkan, who served as environment minister from 2013 to 2016, said action at the Mobuoy site is needed as a matter of urgency.\n\"I have previously described the situation here as a ticking time bomb,\" Mr Durkan told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today .\n\"It does need addressed, the longer it is left without that major work being done, the more of a threat it poses,\" he said.\nMr Durkan said that he has raised the need for a public inquiry into what went on at the Mobuoy site with Mr Muir.\nIn September 2022, two men pleaded guilty to a number of charges linked to the unauthorised disposal of waste.\nThey have yet to be sentenced.",

    "It translates as \"crooked horn\", but President Zelensky calls Kryvyi Rih his \"big soul and heart\".\nHe credits this gritty, industrial city with moulding his character. He grew up in a sprawling block of flats known as the Anthill.\nWhen you stand in front of this towering structure, Volodymyr Zelensky's journey from this setting to wartime leader feels remarkable.\n\"I want the war to end soon,\" says Vita, who lived near Zelensky's parents. \"He's a normal, good guy who fights for people. I just want this war and the sirens to end sooner.\"\nBut with minimal Ukrainian progress and growing Russian dominance, there is no end in sight, and that's both fuelling and being fuelled by influential pockets of Western doubters.\nAt the recent Munich Security Conference, President Zelensky told delegates not to ask Ukraine when the war would end, but instead to \"ask why Putin is still able to continue it\".\nWith blocked military aid now directly hampering his forces on the front line, it was a swipe at those delaying the ammunition and weapons his soldiers desperately need.\n\"I'm no politician,\" confesses Valeriy, a man in his 80s perched outside a grocery shop. \"We can't ask when the war will stop again.\n\"We must fight; we won't tolerate anything else. People are so angry now.\"\nThat appetite to defend has remained mostly intact since that morning on 24 February 2022. Against a terrifying unknown, people volunteered in their thousands to join Ukraine's fight.\nThe world's gaze turned to Kyiv, from where I was reporting.\nPresident Zelensky's profile and popularity went stratospheric as he turned down offers of evacuation and remained in Kyiv.\n\"I need ammunition, not a ride,\" he said in a now iconic quote.\nHis needs have not changed, but his pleas have lost their electrifying impact.\nA failed counter-offensive in 2023 led to uncomfortable questions over whether Ukraine is capable of liberating its territory.\nRepublican doubters in the US are hindering Ukraine's ability to fight by blocking billions of dollars worth of military aid.

Some have had enough of this war, many men are fearful of being conscripted, and yet they say the conflict is still a fight for survival.\nThe idea of a compromise or concession to Russia is viewed as a defeat. It's existential.\nIn a symptom of the world Ukrainians live in, I now associate playgrounds with death.\nThe last time I saw children play in one was at a school next to my flat in Kyiv, before the invasion. Now they are the site of a devastating missile strike, lying abandoned on a front line, or in Brovary, near Kyiv, the scene of a helicopter crash.\nYouthful innocence replaced with body bags and destruction.\nIn Kryvyi Rih, we meet a tearful Yuriy as he watches his flat get demolished after a missile strike last year. Exposed wallpaper patterns reveal the different lives destroyed.\n\"No one needs this war, what is it for anyway?\" he asks. \"So many people are being killed.\"\nSo, does he think Ukraine should swap territory for peace?\n\"Definitely not,\" he replies bluntly. \"A lot of people died for those territories. There is no point in giving them up.\"\nThe lack of battlefield progress caused a corrosive rift between President Zelensky and the head of his armed forces Valerii Zaluzhnyi. Now sacked, General Zaluzhnyi is seen as a potential political rival to his old boss.\nAround Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainians try to help where their country's allies increasingly will not. In one inconspicuous building, a growing army of volunteers stitch camouflage nettings for troops on the front line.\nThe men and women are kept separate because of \"their different jokes,\" explains the organiser.\nIn another industrial wing of the city, a former bike club has swapped cycling for smoke. Teams mix chemicals into canisters which will become smoke grenades. A useful military tool if you are trying to attack, or evacuate the injured.\n\"It's impossible to stay at home with my thoughts when my husband is fighting,\" explains Ines, one of the volunteers. \"Here I feel I can do something to make it easier for them.\"\nRussia's decade of aggression towards Ukraine began with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and then spilled into a draining war in the country's east. On the 731st day of the full-scale invasion, it's a different kind of war.\nWhile extraordinary, Ukraine's successes in defence and degrading Russia's navy have not changed the tide in its favour.\nThe novelty of this war has gone. Ukraine, Kryvyi Rih and its famous son will need to find new reserves of strength and a clever playbook to keep the world engaged.\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous, Scarlett Barter and Svitlana Libet.",
    "A century-old cricket club is in danger of closing after a struggle to find new players.\nBishopthorpe Cricket Club has launched a recruitment drive to find new members who can play at Ferry Lane playing fields, York, before the new season starts in April.\nIf the field is no longer in use, the lease is expected to return to the landowners, the club said.\nPlayer Ed Townend said it \"would be really sad if the club was to fall\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio York, he said the Yorkshire Premier League Division Four side would make a decision in the next couple of weeks about its future.\n\"We're in a position at the moment where the club is on the brink of closure if we aren't able to find some new players,\" he said.\nMr Townend continued: \"We've seen a number of players over the years either retire or move away and we've not got any new players into the club.\n\"We're just trying to put an appeal out there to see if there's any budding cricketers or anybody that may have played in the past who think they might like to give it a go again.\"\nThe club has seen its 20-strong team drop down to about eight or nine men over the last couple of years.\nMr Townend said they were seeking males or females to just \"enjoy the cricket club for what it is\", rather than having to commit to attending training and matches each week.\n\"It's a good setup at the club - nice ground, good camaraderie, good teamwork amongst the players,\" he said.\n\"Everyone gets on really well, you play hard and then have a drink afterwards as a team and it's good for village life.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Oil leaking from a capsized barge off the coast of Tobago has spread hundreds of miles to reach the Caribbean island of Bonaire.\nOfficials on Bonaire, which is located 50 miles (80km) north of the Venezuelan coast, said the oil posed a \"serious threat to both humans and nature\".\nThe island is the latest to have been contaminated with oil from the barge which ran aground earlier this month.\nIt is still unclear who owns the barge and what may have caused it to sink.\nThe authorities on Bonaire, which is a special municipality of the Netherlands, said the island's east coast, including Sorobon, Lac and Lagun, had been polluted.\nThey also warned that the island's mangrove, fish and coral ecosystems were at risk.\nThe oil leak was first spotted by the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard on 7 February. They traced it to a barge which had become lodged on a reef about 150m (500 ft) off Tobago's southern coast.\nThere was no crew on board the barge and the Coast Guard said it had not received any distress signals. They did, however, spot the name \"Gulfstream\" painted on the side of the vessel.\nTrinidad and Tobago authorities said the barge had originated in Panama and had been towed by a tugboat. They said it appeared \"to have been bound for Guyana\".\nAn investigation conducted by online investigative journalism site Bellingcat suggests the barge stopped in late January in Pozuelos Bay, a Venezuelan port used by the state-owned PdVSA oil company.\nAccording to Bellingcat, the barge may have started leaking oil as early as 3 February. The whereabouts of the boat which had tugged the barge are not currently known.\nThe prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago declared a national emergency on 11 February. The country's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management has been trying to contain the spillage but oil has been continuing to leak from the barge.\nThe Trinidad and Tobago Weather Center said satellite images suggested the oil slick had spread into the marine area of Grenada as early as 14 February .\nFrom there, it appears to have been carried further westward to Bonaire.\nOfficials on Bonaire are particularly concerned for the mangroves, which are among the best preserved in the Caribbean.",

    "A boating lake inspired by JM Barrie's Peter Pan and created by a friend of the author as part of a holiday village has received Grade II listing.\nThe Meare at Thorpeness, Suffolk, is one of five parks and gardens in the county to be listed.\nIt was designed so children could row or sail in the safety of shallow water, stopping at islands with names such as the Pirate's Lair and Wendy's House.\nThe listings follow a two-year, \u00c2\u00a336,000 Historic England project.\nProject volunteer Patience Shone said: \"It has been interesting learning about the complexities of the listing process that is intended to protect these important Suffolk sites for future generations.\"\nListing gives the gardens and parks the same recognition and protection as buildings.\nThorpeness was the inspiration of landowner Glencairn Stuart Ogilvie, after the lawyer, playwright and amateur architect inherited the Sizewell Hall estate from his parents.\nHe came up with the idea of creating a purpose-built holiday village, the first of only two complete planned resort villages in Britain.\nThe 60-acre (25ha) Meare was central to his plan, intended to allow children the freedom of unsupervised play, featuring islands, water channels and areas of open lake no more than 1m (3.2ft) deep.\nAs JM Barrie was a good friend, Mr Ogilvie was given permission to use Wendy's House and the crocodile from Peter Pan, while other inspiration came from Charles Dickens' Peggoty's House.\nAimed at stimulating imagination and adventurous play, creations also included the Smuggler's Cave and the Pirate's Lair.\nThe other parks and gardens receiving Grade II listing include Abbot's Hall in Stowmarket, the pleasure grounds of an early 18th century house; the Walled Garden at the Royal Hospital School in Holbrook, featuring a distinctive \"crinkle-crankle\" wall - which used fewer bricks in response to the Brick Tax (1784 to 1850); and the unusual early country house landscape of mooted Crow's Hall in Debenham.\nStaverton Park, a medieval deer park at Wantisden, near Eyke, and once owned by royalty, receives Grade II* listing.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Kanye West is being sued by Donna Summer's estate for allegedly using an uncleared sample of her music on his new album.\nCourt documents show that the Queen of Disco's estate denied Kanye's request to sample the 1977 hit I Feel Love.\nWest has become a controversial figure in recent years - comments he has made have been heavily criticised as far right or antisemitic.\nThe rapper has not yet commented on the legal action taken by Summer's estate.\nA sample of I Feel Love was used on his track Good (Don't Die).\nThe song appeared on his album Vultures 1 earlier this month, but has since been removed from streaming services.\nAn attorney for Summer's estate claims an entity called Alien Music, representing West, approached him on 31 January, a week before the release of the rapper's album, to request clearance to sample the disco hit.\nThe request was denied as the estate said there could be a \"potential degradation to Summer's legacy\" as \"West is known as a controversial public figure whose conduct has led numerous brands and business partners to disassociate from him\".\nThe attorney claims the rapper attempted to use a soundalike of the song instead of the original to get around the denied request, but he says it is still copyright infringement.\nFollowing the release of the album, Summer's estate says it contacted streaming services requesting the song be removed.\nThe album was removed a few days later and re-uploaded without the track. However, the lawsuit claims the song has harmed the estate as it was streamed millions of times.\nThe lawsuit, filed against the 46-year-old rapper, his record label and collaborator Ty Dolla $ign, is asking for damages and an injunction to block further distribution of the song.\nThe singer, who died of lung cancer in 2012, is best known for hits including Love to Love You Baby and Hot Stuff.\nThe BBC has also asked Giorgio Moroder, who co-write and produced I Feel Love, for comment on the case.\nSummer is not the only artist to recently deny sample requests by Kanye.\nEarlier in February, Ozzy Osbourne blocked Kanye from sampling a 1983 live version of Black Sabbath's Iron Man on his Vultures 1 album.\nDespite denying the request, Kanye allegedly used a sample of the song during a listening party for the new album.\nHowever, the sample was not used in the final version of his song, Carnival which debuted at number one on the US Billboard's Streaming Songs chart.\nThe rock artist, 75, said he denied the request as he believed Kanye was \"an anti-Semite\".\nIn an interview after the release of the track, Osbourne's wife, TV personality Sharon Osbourne said that in recent times Kanye \"represents hate\".\nKanye, now known as Ye, was banned from Twitter in December 2022 over offensive tweets. He was restored on the account eight months later.\nFollowing anti-Semitic comments on social media, Adidas, who produce the US rapper's Yeezy trainers, cut ties with him.\nThe singer-songwriter first rose to fame in 2004 and has sold 160 million records since.",

Relatives in Israel are left waiting, with no idea of the conditions they are being held in.\nAt least 29,800 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThis is a day in the life in Gaza.\n05:00: In Rafah, 59-year-old Sami Abu Omar wakes up early after a \"hard night\".\n\"Any person in this situation has to get used to sleeping for an hour to an hour and a half only,\" he says, describing the sound of bombing.\nAfter getting out of his tent, he prays and then heads to a distribution centre, where he will serve up lentil soup to displaced families.\n07:00: In the central city of Deir al-Balah, nurse Rewaa Mohsen changes the nappies of her two young daughters.

and whether the government should have called them off earlier in 2020 - is among the issues being examined.\nMr Poole revealed that Lee Waters, deputy minister for transport, said in a WhatsApp message that he thought it was an \"odd signal to send\" that Welsh Labour had cancelled its 2020 conference but allowed 70,000 to gather in Cardiff for Wales versus Scotland.\nThe match was cancelled the day before by the Welsh Rugby Union, but not before 20,000 Scottish fans travelled to Cardiff.\nOn the day lockdown was announced in March 2020, Vaughan Gething emailed himself an account of \"chaos\" in a Welsh hospital from a consultant.\n\"No protection for nurses, very low morale as being asked to care for patients admitted to orthopaedic wards by medics with respiratory symptoms, masks not being released,\" it read.\nAt the start of the hearing, chairwoman Baroness Hallett acknowledged that some had hoped for an independent Welsh inquiry.\nShe said that was not a decision for her, but she promised that the UK inquiry will do its utmost to \"investigate and analyse fully and fairly the most significant issues that concern people in Wales\".\nThe inquiry showed a video of testimonies of those impacted by Covid.\nThe emotional video detailed delayed diagnosis of cancer, the experience of trying to see relatives in hospital, and of patients catching Covid when they were admitted for other conditions.\nAfter the hearing Plaid Cymru's spokesperson for health and social care, Mabon ap Gwynfor, claimed \"Labour Welsh government's lies\" had been \"further exposed on the first day of the UK Covid inquiry\".\n\"It is quite simply alarming that the most senior special advisers to the Labour Welsh government encouraged each other and others to 'clear out WhatsApp chat once a week', and that Vaughan Gething as the health min",

    "A town's shopping mall is due to be demolished by 2025 as part of redevelopment of the town centre, a council has said.\nBolton's Crompton Place was described as an \"underused and unappealing building\" by Council Leader Nick Peel.\nIts demolition could lead to a \u00c2\u00a3300m transformation of the area, creating housing alongside shops, the council said.\nBuilt in 1971, Crompton Place was bought by the council in 2018.\nThe authority then enabled leaseholders to relocate so demolition work could start.\nHowever, some of the remaining leaseholders, including Marks & Spencer, retained a lease until 2027, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nFollowing complex negotiations, the council's cabinet is set to consider options to agree an early surrender of that lease.\nMr Peel said it was \"an opportunity to replace an underused and unappealing building with something everyone in Bolton can be proud of\".\nIf early surrender of the lease is accepted, it could allow for work to start as soon as the anchor Primark store moves to the Market Place shopping centre in late 2024 or early 2025.\nA public consultation will be held about the future use of the site, which could host leisure and health facilities.\n'Vibrant destination'\nThe move could also provide direct links from Victoria Square to Bradshawgate.\nMr Peel said: \"This is part of the council's plan to consolidate and concentrate Bolton's retail offer, creating more space for residential, hospitality, leisure, and employment opportunities.\n\"This will be our flagship redevelopment project, signalling to the private sector that Bolton Council is serious about regeneration and thereby attracting even more commercial investment.\"\nDeputy council leader Akhtar Zaman added: \"Shopping will always be an essential part of Bolton's identity but as more people shop online, modern town centres have to be about more than just retail.\"\nHe said the council was working to \"create a more vibrant destination, where people want to live, work, study, eat out and enjoy our many cultural venues.\"\nThe plan will be considered at a cabinet meeting on 4 March.\nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "New safety cameras are being trialled in Sussex to detect if drivers are using phones or not wearing seatbelts.\nFootage is processed by technology, using artificial intelligence (AI), before images are passed to police.\nMotoring journalist and director of UK Motor Talk Graham Benge said: \"I am not convinced by this idea, replacing good old-fashioned policing with cameras.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable Simon Dobinson said he was looking forward to seeing the trial's outcomes.\nSussex Police's head of operations added: \"It gives us a unique opportunity to learn how AI-enabled cameras can potentially support partnership colleagues and ourselves in influencing driver behaviour and keeping motorists safe on our roads.\"\nThe cameras are mounted to a vehicle or trailer and can automatically detect if motorists are committing an offence.\nThe trial in Sussex began on 19 February and runs until March 2025.\nThe cameras, which are being used across 10 forces , were first launched as a pilot project between National Highways and Warwickshire Police in 2021.\nMr Benge said: \"We all know that the standards of driving on the roads are falling.\n\"If you have more traffic patrols on the road then the driving standards generally improve. There's a very clear deterrent effect.\"\nWhile speaking on BBC Radio Sussex , the motoring journalist also raised privacy concerns about people being monitored in their cars, as well as the need for human intervention with the cameras.\nHe said: \"It's very difficult to tell at 70mph between someone eating a chocolate bar and somebody who is using a mobile phone.\"\nMr Benge said he believes the cameras could result in a number of disputes being taken to court.\nHe added: \"It's a budgetary way of dealing with things, I think, rather than actual police numbers, which I'm much in favour of.\"\nA National Highways spokesperson it was working with police to reduce dangerous driving.\nThey added: \"We believe that using technology like this will make people seriously consider their driving behaviour.\"\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "In a historic move, South Africa's parliament has impeached one of the country's top judges for misconduct.\nAn investigation found that John Hlophe, the leading judge in Western Cape province, tried to influence justices at the country's top court in a case relating to former President Jacob Zuma.\nHe approached two justices in 2008 to see if they would support Mr Zuma in a decision relating to a corruption case.\nMr Hlophe always denied the accusation.\nThe long delay between the alleged offence and his impeachment was a result of a lengthy appeals and investigations.\nThe removal of a judge is unprecedented since the start of the country's democratic era in 1994.\nA second judge, Nkola Motata, was also impeached for disorderly conduct and racial outbursts relating to a 2007 drunk-driving accident.\nMr Motata, who has since retired, was a High Court judge in Gauteng province at the time of the incident.\nHe also denied the accusation.\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa will now have to sign-off the decision and set a date for their formal removal.\nThe judges will then lose all benefits, including a lifetime salary worth over 1m rand ($53,000; \u00c2\u00a342,000) a year, a car allowance and comprehensive medical care.\nMr Hlophe was the first to be impeached on Wednesday evening with MPs voting by the required two-thirds majority.\nThe decision was backed by the governing African National Congress (ANC) as well as the main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) plus other minor parties.\nA last-ditch attempt by Mr Hlophe to halt his possible removal was thrown out by a court just hours earlier.\nHis impeachment was quickly followed by that of Mr Motata.\nAn investigation by an oversight body, the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), found that in 2008 Mr Hlophe had made contact with two of the eleven judges of the Constitutional Court in an attempt to sway a ruling in Mr Zuma's favour relating to a matter in his arms-deal corruption case.\nMr Zuma has denied the corruption allegations and there is no suggestion that he had anything to do with Mr Hlophe's actions.\nNeither impeached judges have responded to the MPs' decisions, but Mr Hlophe had argued in court papers that the role of parliament was not simply to rubber stamp findings by the JSC but to do its own investigation.\nANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said the party welcomed parliament's decision, while the DA's Glynnis Breytenbach said her party felt vindicated after \"years of the ANC government dragging its feet\" on the judges' removal.\n\"We may have waited 15 years for this moment, but the impeachment of Judge Hlophe, or any judge, has profound implications for judicial integrity in South Africa. It underscores the importance of upholding the highest ethical standards, the rule of law, and the constitution among judicial officers.\n\"It also sends a clear message that no-one, regardless of their position or influence, is above the law,\" Ms Breytenbach said.\nOpposition party the Economic Freedom Fighters voted against the impeachments, with MP Busisiwe Mkhwebane arguing that the judges were remorseful and should be allowed to live the rest of their lives in peace.\n\"Can we let Judge Motata, in his misjudgement, be left to enjoy his retirement at home. We know that Hlophe was highly qualified and did his work with dignity. Punish this ANC government,\" she told parliament, to cheers from her party's benches.\nLawyer and the co-ordinator of advocacy group Judges Matter, Alison Tilley, told the BBC the removals were an important moment in the country's history.\n\"It has taken time but it shows the systems to hold the judiciary to account do work. There are mechanisms that are now in place that give us confidence that a similar process would not take as long.\"",

    "The Kremlin has accused Joe Biden of attempting to appear like a \"Hollywood cowboy\" after the US president called Vladimir Putin \"a crazy SOB\".\nMr Biden made the comment at a public fundraising event on Wednesday in California, warning about the threat of nuclear conflict.\nThe Russian president responded by dismissing the remark as \"rude\".\nHe linked the attack to his earlier claim he would prefer Mr Biden in the White House to Donald Trump.\nIn a brief speech in San Francisco, Mr Biden said: \"We have a crazy SOB like that guy Putin, and others, and we always have to worry about nuclear conflict, but the existential threat to humanity is climate.\"\nIt is not the first time the US president has used the offensive term. In a hot-mic slip in 2022, Mr Biden called a Fox News journalist a \"son of a bitch\". He has also called Mr Putin a \"butcher\" and a \"war criminal\" in the past.\nOn Thursday, Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the comment \"debases America\" and described Mr Biden as a \"Hollywood cowboy\".\n\"Has Mr Putin ever used one crude word to address you?\" he added.\nMr Putin raised eyebrows last week when he said he would prefer Mr Biden to defeat Mr Trump in the November presidential election, describing the incumbent as \"more experienced, he's predictable, he's an old-style politician\".\nHe has now suggested Mr Biden's \"crazy SOB\" comment was linked to that claim.\nHe told Russian TV: \"I said that we would work with any president, but I think that for us, for Russia, Biden is more preferable.\n\"And judging by what he said, I am absolutely right.

Till next time we meet!\"\nMore tributes have flooded in from those who worked with Myers and his TV partner Si King, and who they met on their motorcycle trips around the UK.\nThe pair travelled the country and the world over two decades to make much-loved shows about the food and people they found.\nTheir first series, 2006's The Hairy Bikers' Cookbook, was partly filmed in Romania - where Myers met his future wife, who was working in a hotel.\nThey kept in touch but didn't fall in love until she came to the UK to visit him on holiday a few years later.\n'My heart melted'\nSpeaking in 2021 , she recalled: \"I was blown away by one tiny little thing. He picked me up from the airport... It was about midnight and he opened the fridge and he said, 'What do you want me to cook for you?'\n\"I'd never ever in my life had a man cook for me.

Much love to you and your friends and family.\"\nSavident joined the Manchester-based soap in 1994, and quickly became a favourite with viewers thanks to his huge personality and loud voice.\nHis storylines involved his disastrous love life, including three marriages and several failed proposals.\nA secret son, Ashley Peacock (played by Steven Arnold), also arrived on the show and the two later developed a close bond as they worked as butchers together.\nSavident's character was killed off in 2006, suffering a stroke on the day he was supposed to marry Bev Unwin (Susie Blake).\nElliott's death also saw Roberts, his former romantic interest, confess she still loved him following her turning down his proposal of marriage years previously.\nThe butcher's other previous wives were Maureen Holdsworth (Sherrie Hewson) and barmaid Eve Sykes (Melanie Kilburn).\nOne of Elliott's most distinctive character traits was that he often said things twice, usually inserting the words \"I say\" between them - for example: \"Best of British is that, I say best of British.\"\nShortly before the character died, Elliott said to Audrey Roberts: \"Be happy, I say, be happy.\"\nIain MacLeod, ITV's executive producer for continuing drama, said: \"Everyone at Coronation Street is deeply saddened to learn of John Savident's death.\n\"As Fred Elliott, John firmly established himself in the pantheon of Coronation Street greats.\n\"His peerless comic timing, combined with a deep pathos arising from his outstanding dramatic skill, made Fred an unforgettable, iconic character that provided great joy to viewers for many years.\"\nOutside Coronation Street, Savident's other screen credits included a role in political comedy Yes, Minister.\nHe was cast in Doctor Who, Stanley Kubrick's dystopian thriller A Clockwork Orange, biopic Gandhi, war film Battle Of Britain, and period drama Middlemarch.\nSavident also appeared opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins in 1993's Oscar-nominated The Remains Of The Day.\nHe was in the first staging of the musical Phantom Of The Opera, in October 1986 in the West End, as the opera house owner Monsieur Firmin.\nAfter leaving his soap work, Savident appeared on stage in productions of panto Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs and Harold Brighouse's Hobson's Choice.\nBorn in Guernsey in 1938 to a local fisherman father and a Swiss mother, Savident and his family left the Channel Islands, then under German occupation, and moved to Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, when he was three.\nHe started his career as a policeman in Manchester and during his six years of service was stabbed in the arm as he tried to break up a gang fight.\nInitially pursuing his acting ambitions in amateur productions, Savident quit the force when a producer overheard him talking in a pub and offered him a part as Robin Hood in a London panto, launching his acting career.\nSavident was married to theatre director Rona Hopkinson and they had two children.\nBroadcaster Tom Hourigan said Savident delivered \"arguably one of the most distinctive characters - and deliveries - in British soap history\".\nActor Stuart Antony shared a picture of himself with Savident, describing him as \"always lovely and witty\".\nA statement from Savident's agent announcing his death to the PA news agency said: \"He was a much-loved husband and father of two and will be sorely missed by all who knew him.\"",
    "Three members of a drug cartel involved in a series of gangland killings have been jailed for life, in the biggest criminal trial in Dutch history.\nThe gang's \"undisputed\" ringleader, Ridouan Taghi, was for years one of the Netherlands' most-wanted fugitives.\nTaghi was jailed for murder, firearms offences and aggravated robbery.\nTwo other men, Said R and Mario R - whose full names cannot be revealed under Dutch law - were also given life sentences.\nThey were convicted of complicity in murder, attempted murder, preparation for and complicity in murder.\nIn total, 17 people were handed sentences ranging from life in prison to one year and nine months.\nThe nature and scale of this case is unprecedented in the Netherlands.\nIt took 142 hearing days spread over almost six years, 800 pages of pleadings and more than 3,000 pages of documents from the lawyers to arrive at today's verdicts.\nFrom the outset the \"mega-trial\" - which began on 11 March 2021 - has been shrouded in secrecy and security.\nThe court president said the \"Marengo\" trial - named after the codeword for the police operation which led to the arrests - was about \"ruthless, disruptive violence\".\n\"When we read the messages in the file, we end up in a world where human life has no value,\" he said.\nThe trial has captivated a country that has recently been forced to confront its violent underworld.\nThe gang's murders were well prepared by using \"spotters\" or using sophisticated sounding beacons.\nAccording to the court, the organisation counted not only gunmen and drivers among its many members, but also corrupt officials who provided vital insider information.\nTaghi, 46, was found guilty of being the undisputed leader of the criminal organisation, which is thought to have been one of the Netherlands' biggest drug cartels.\nHe was the subject of an international arrest warrant and was eventually arrested in Dubai in 2019, where he had been living below the radar in a suburban villa.\nUnder his leadership, five people were assassinated over the course of 18 months. There were also two attempted murders and more were planned.\nAn attack was also prepared on a \"spy shop\" selling sophisticated surveillance gear where the gang were regular customers.\nFor years, Taghi and his gang seemed to operate with impunity - their crimes shrouded by a culture of fear and silence.\nCriminal rivals, associates who defaulted on debts or talked to the gang's enemies or the police were all at risk of ending up on a death list.\nTaghi's methods belonged to a new type of Dutch mobster that grew up in the vacuum left behind by the notorious old-school Dutch gangsters like Willem Holleeder - and signalled a worrying escalation in the drugs war.\nThe ease with which Taghi decided that someone should be killed was described by the judges as \"shocking\" and ruthless.\nIn some cases, young children were present when their fathers were shot dead.\nTaghi was not among the eight suspects who attended court on Tuesday.\nThose who did were brought to the high-security courthouse - nicknamed the \"Bunker\" - in armoured vehicles. Heavily armed police stood guard outside the building, wearing body armour and balaclavas as surveillance drones buzzed overhead.\nThe court noted it was significant that none of the surviving relatives of the gang's victims made use of the right to speak or submitted a claim as an injured party, such is the fear and vulnerability they still feel.\nOne person who did speak out was a man called Nabil B, who became the key witness at the heart of the mega-trial. Court cameras only filmed him below the neck, so as to conceal his identity.\nNabil B was found guilty of being complicit and an accessory to murder, but handed a lesser sentence of 10 years due to personal circumstances and the role he played in bringing his former accomplices to justice.\nJust before reading out the verdict, the court reflected on three targeted killings of people close to Nabil B - which all occurred while the investigation was under way.\nA week after it became public knowledge, in early 2018, that Nabil B had turned informant and cut a deal with prosecutors as a key witness, his brother was shot dead.\nA year later, Nabil B's lawyer, Derk Wiersum, was murdered outside his home .\nThen, in July 2021, his confidante, the investigative journalist Peter R de Vries, was shot on a summer evening after leaving a TV studio in central Amsterdam. He died soon after.\nNabil B called the Marengo case \"the most diseased and poisoned trial ever\".\nBefore the sentences were read out today, the court said these three killings added a \"dark edge\" to the proceedings.\nThose murders are now being dealt with in separate trials.",

    "The boss of the nationalised Ferguson shipyard has said lessons have been learned, as further costs and delays to two new Calmac ferries were confirmed.\nMV Glen Sannox is now due for handover in late May or June, six years late, and cost have risen by up to \u00c2\u00a37m.\nThe second ship MV Glen Rosa is now due in September next year but Ferguson chief executive David Tydeman said he hoped it would be three months earlier.\nHe told MSPs: \"We have learned all the lessons from Glen Sannox.\"\nConstruction of the two vessels, the first ships ever built by a UK shipyard capable of running on liquefied natural gas (LNG), has been plagued by design challenges since the order was placed in 2015.\nSteel fabrication outpaced detailed design work, leading to errors and reworking, with repeated delays and cost increases that continued after the Port Glasgow yard fell back into administration and was nationalised in 2019.\nThe yard's former owner, Jim McColl, blamed ferries procurement agency CMAL for putting a poorly-developed concept design out to tender, and then interfering in the design process  - but CMAL rejected that claim, saying problems arose due to \"catastrophic\" contractor failure.\nMr Tydeman told MSPs on the net zero and transport committee that the LNG technology was well-established but had taken up a \"disproportionate\" amount of the effort to complete the ships.\nHe said the latest delays were because a supplier was unable to provide essential LNG pipework when required, and the yard had been forced to engage alternative contractors.\nA resulting two-month delay in the handover of Glen Sannox meant the cost to complete the ship will be up to \u00c2\u00a3149.1m, he earlier confirmed in a letter.\nThe cost to complete Glen Rosa could be up to \"maximum\" of \u00c2\u00a3150m but Mr Tydeman hopes to shave \u00c2\u00a310m off that figure by \"capturing\" learning from the first ship.\nHe said: \"We are in a much stronger place on the second ship, we have learned all the lessons from Glen Sannox.\n\"I hope it is a delivery challenge, putting the ship together rather than learning and engineering and finishing the design work that we've had to do on Glen Sannox.\"\nThe latest cost figures do not include money spent on the ships prior to nationalisation, which take the total cost of the ships to around \u00c2\u00a3400m if written-off government loans are included. The contract price was \u00c2\u00a397m.\nFuture opportunities\nDespite the problems with Glen Sannox and Glen Rosa, Mr Tydeman said the world shipbuilding market was buoyant and there were potential opportunities for the Inverclyde shipyard.\nHe listed areas such as offshore wind support ships or crew transport vessels, as well as sub-contracting on military orders.\nIn the short term, the yard is hoping to secure a contract for seven smaller all-electric vessels for CalMac which would provide a steady flow of work in the coming years.\nA request for \u00c2\u00a325m of Scottish government funding for new equipment, which would make the shipyard more productive, was turned down last year, but Ferguson Marine executives said they would present a revised request shortly.\nMr Tydeman said at the moment there would be a \"small premium\" in buying the small ferries from a Scottish shipyard compared with cheaper yards in Europe.\nIf all goes well with the commissioning of the LNG systems on Glen Sannox, he said he hoped it would be delivered by late May or early June.\nWest coast ferry operator CalMac will then need to conduct its own sea trials so the ship, destined for the Arran route, is unlikely to be carrying passengers until August or September.\nThe first of four ferries being built by a Turkish shipyard, which have smaller cargo-carrying capacity and more conventional propulsion systems, is due for delivery in October.",

    "Council debts run up from a loan taken to host the World Student Games in Sheffield more than 30 years ago will finally be paid off next month.\nSheffield City Council spent millions building new venues for the 1991 event, but with interest and four rounds of re-financing the costs soared to \u00c2\u00a3658m.\nSome said it transformed the city while others branded it a financial disaster .\nCouncil leader Tom Hunt said clearing the debt would free up money to invest in leisure facilities.\nAt the time, the games were the biggest sporting event to be held in the UK since the 1948 London Olympics, attracting 3,300 athletes from 101 countries.\nHosting the event was seen as a bold way to regenerate Sheffield's former industrial sites after the closure of the steelworks and mass redundancies of the 1980s.\nSeveral new sporting venues, including Don Valley Stadium, Ponds Forge and Sheffield Arena, were built to host the events, but with no financial support from government the council footed the bill.\nSheffield South East MP Clive Betts, who was council leader at the time of the games, said the actual cost of hosting the event was \u00c2\u00a310m - less than 1% of the council's budget - which was paid off within two years.\nHe said it was the additional loans needed to build the various venues which led to the debt and the perception the event had cost so much was wrong because the council had re-mortgaged the original loan to pay for other services over the years.\nHe said the games brought the city together and gave people \"wonderful facilities\" that had been used for more than 30 years.\nAnalysis: Lucy Ashton, BBC Sheffield political reporter\nThe games have been largely forgotten outside Sheffield, but in the city's Town Hall they have been used as javelins to puncture Labour for years.\nEvery time councillors wrangle with budgets, opposition politicians and members of the public would summon the ghost of the 1991 sporting spectacle.\nBut supporters say the games led to world-class facilities, such as the National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine and the Advance Wellbeing Research Centre - which rose like a phoenix from the flames of the old Don Valley Stadium site after it was demolished in 2013 .\nPeter Price, 85, was one of the original councillors who approved the games. He's still their most passionate cheerleader and was disappointed when their 30th anniversary wasn't celebrated.\nHe told a Town Hall meeting back in 2021: \"The objective was to act as a catalyst to regenerate our city.\"\nAs the final repayment is made, supporters will hope the games paid off enough for Sheffield to cement itself as the city of sport.\nMr Hunt said making the final repayment of the loan in March would be a \"big milestone\".\n\"This was an investment in the city's future made by the city to make sure we had world class leisure and entertainment facilities,\" he said.\n\"Thousands of people on a weekly basis are still enjoying those facilities.\n\"We're now looking to the future to think about how we can ensure we continue to have modern, accessible leisure facilities that mean we can compete on the national and international stage.\"\nHe said the authority planned to rebuild some of the city's \"more tired facilities\" such as the Springs Leisure Centre and Hillsborough Leisure Centre.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "A New York City medical school will offer students free tuition following a $1bn donation from the 93-year-old widow of a major Wall Street investor.\nThe gift to Albert Einstein College of Medicine came from Dr Ruth Gottesman, a former professor at the Bronx school.\nIt is one of the largest ever donations made to a US school and is the largest ever made to a medical school.\nThe Bronx, New York City's poorest borough, is ranked as the unhealthiest of New York state's 62 counties.\nIn a statement, university dean Dr Yaron Yomer said that the \"transformational\" gift \"radically revolutionises our ability to continue attracting students who are committed to our mission, not just those who can afford it\".\nTuition at the school is nearly $59,000 (\u00c2\u00a346,500) each year, leaving students with substantial debt.\nThe statement from Einstein noted students in their final year will be reimbursed for their spring 2024 tuition, and from August, all students, including those who are currently enrolled, will receive free tuition.\nThe donation \"will free up and lift our students, enabling them to pursue projects and ideas that might otherwise be prohibitive\", Dr Yomer added.\nDr Gottesman, now 93, began working at the school in 1968. She studied learning disabilities, ran literacy programmes and developed widely used screening and evaluation protocols.\nHer late husband, David \"Sandy\" Gottesman, founded a prominent investment house and was an early investor in Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffet's multinational conglomerate. He died in September 2022 at the age of 96.\nDr Gottesman said in a statement that the doctors who train at Einstein go on to \"provide the finest healthcare to communities here in the Bronx and all over the world\".\n\"I am very thankful to my late husband, Sandy, for leaving these funds in my care, and l feel blessed to be given the great privilege of making this gift to such a worthy cause,\" she added.\nAbout 50% of Einstein's first-year students are from New York, and approximately 60% are women. Statistics published by the school show that about 48% of its medical students are white, while 29% are Asian, 11% are Hispanic and 5% are black.\nIn an interview with the New York Times, she recalled that her late husband had left her a \"whole portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway stock\" when he died with the instructions to \"do whatever you think is right with it\".\n\"I wanted to fund students at Einstein so that they would receive free tuition,\" Dr Gottesman said she immediately realised. \"There was enough money to do that in perpetuity.\"\nShe added that she occasionally wonders what her husband would have thought of the donation.\n\"I hope he's smiling and not frowning,\" she said. \"He gave me the opportunity to do this, and I think he would be happy - I hope so.\"",
    "Veteran MSP Fergus Ewing has renewed his criticism of the SNP after losing an appeal against a week-long suspension from the party's group at Holyrood.\nDisciplinary action was taken in September against the former minister.\nMr Ewing, who has repeatedly criticised party leadership, branded the SNP an \"authoritarian party\".\nAn SNP spokesman said: \"Discipline is an internal matter for the SNP Holyrood group.\"\nThe suspension took effect from midnight.\nEarlier last year, Mr Ewing voted against the government in a no-confidence motion on Greens minister Lorna Slater.\nIn September, the SNP's Holyrood group voted to take action against the Inverness and Nairn MSP by 48 votes to nine with four abstentions.\nAmong the MSPs who supported him were former leadership contender Kate Forbes, his sister Annabelle Ewing, and Christine Grahame.\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf was absent for the vote, as was his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon, who had a prior engagement.\nOn Good Morning Scotland the MSP continued his criticism of the SNP's deal with the Greens, saying they were an \"extremist\" group who had brought \"dismal mismanagement\" and \"duff policies\" to government.\nThe MSP also said that it was time for First Minister Humza Yousaf to move forward plans to improve the A9 and the A96.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Mr Ewing highlighted his opposition to the deposit return scheme and said the SNP \"no longer tolerates a conscience vote\".\nHe said the party implemented new rules in 2021 preventing SNP MSPs from exercising a such a vote, unless there was prior approval from the whole group, and called for the clause to be removed.\nMr Ewing added: \"The SNP has now become an authoritarian party requiring strict obedience to the leadership at the expense of personal freedom for any individual member.\"\nThe former minister said he believed the public did not want MSPs \"who must always blindly follow the party line\".\nHis statement continued: \"If my constituents wanted a doormat, they would have gone to B&Q.\"\nOn Good Morning Scotland he added that he believed that the partnership had damaged public trust in the SNP and that the party should be a broader church.\nThe disciplinary action came after Mr Ewing's vote against Ms Slater in a no-confidence vote.\nThe motion was tabled by the Tories last June over the circular economy minister's handling of the deposit return scheme.\nMr Ewing told Good Morning Scotland that he had rebelled against the party as he was \"standing up\" for his constituents against the policy, which he labelled \"truly disastrous.\"\nMr Ewing, who served as rural economy secretary under Nicola Sturgeon, has also criticised Scottish government policies on gender recognition reform and Highly Protected Marine Areas , as well as attacking ministers over a lack of progress on dualling the A9 .\nHe stated: \"I will continue to speak out for things like the A96 ... I will do my job and my question to Humza Yousaf is when will you do yours?\n\"You came to Inverness and you promised this will be a top priority when you became leader. Nothing has happened over the past three years.\"\nCraig Hoy, the chairman of the Scottish Tories, said: \"This decision shows how Humza Yousaf and the SNP have turned their back on rural Scotland and the major issues that are affecting those areas. Even Fergus Ewing recognises that the SNP are failing them.\"\nThe former minister has been an MSP since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.\nHe is the son of SNP icon Winnie Ewing , who died last June aged 93.",
    "The government has outlined further details of how it would redirect funding from the scrapped northern legs of the HS2 rail line.\nAround \u00c2\u00a34.7bn from cancelling the high-speed routes is due to be handed to councils outside big cities in the Midlands and northern England.\nCouncils would be responsible for allocating funds to specific projects, in line with government guidance.\nBut Labour said the \"reannouncement\" was just a \"back of a fag packet plan\".\nThe funding has been earmarked for spending between 2025 and 2032, after the next spending review that sets departmental spending.\nThe period covered would also come after the next general election, which is expected later this year, raising further uncertainty over the plans.\nIn October, the government shelved the parts of the HS2 line between the West Midlands to Manchester, and to the East Midlands, following spiralling costs in recent years.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak, who will hold a cabinet meeting in Yorkshire on Monday, has promised that instead \u00c2\u00a336bn will be spent on further transport funding in northern areas of England.\nIt had already announced that \u00c2\u00a34.7bn from the project would be \"reallocated\" to local authorities outside big cities in northern England and the Midlands.\nNow, the transport department has disclosed some further details of how it plans to spend the money, including the funding period and a breakdown by individual local authority.\nGuidance on how the money should be spent would be set out in \"due course\", it added, but cited new bus and railway stations, roads and mass-transit systems as projects that would be eligible.\nIt also suggested it could also go towards refurbishing bus and railway stations, as well as building charging points for electric cars.\nHS2: The End Of The Line\nBBC Transport correspondent Katy Austin explores the journey of HS2.\nWatch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)\n'Brass neck promise'\nThe seven-year funding period mirrors the latest funding allocations to the separate \u00c2\u00a317bn funding pot for big cities.\nThe department said this would help big-city authorities to work with neighbouring councils in more suburban and rural areas on shared projects.\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper said confirmation of the spending would be \"game-changing\" for smaller cities and towns, and enable them to \"drive economic growth\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he defended the delay between the money being announced four months ago but not being given to councils until next year, saying funds had to be \"allocated properly\".\n\"Rather than spending one-third of the government's transport budget on a single rail line between several cities, we're spending it on the transformational projects that matter to people across the country.\"\nBut his Labour counterpart Louise Haigh criticised the \"reannouncement\", adding: \"Local people are sick and tired of this government taking them for fools.\n\"Only the Conservatives could have the brass neck to promise yet another 'transformation' of transport infrastructure in the Midlands and North after 14 years of countless broken promises to do just that,\" she added.\n'Recycling money' complaint\nHenri Murison, chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a lobby group for northern businesses, said he was \"not particularly excited\" by the details shared by ministers.\n\"This is just repeating an old announcement, and recycling money from something that was cancelled,\" he told BBC North West Tonight.\nMr Murison, who is a former Labour councillor, added that the costs to the north of England incurred by cancelling HS2's northern legs would be \"significantly more than the amounts of money that are going to be allocated\" as a result.\nThe government initially gave an outline of how it planned to redirect HS2 funding in a document accompanying the shelving of the northern legs in October.\nThe paper, entitled Network North, was criticised for showcasing funding for some projects that had already been completed , and was subsequently rewritten.\nIt detailed that the government plans to redirect \u00c2\u00a38.3bn towards fixing potholes across England up to 2034, \u00c2\u00a31bn for improving northern and Midlands bus services, and funding to extend the \u00c2\u00a32 bus fare cap until the end of this year.",
    "A new report for the US government has raised serious concerns about Boeing's safety management systems, adding to the scrutiny facing the US plane maker.\nThe review found a \"disconnect\" between senior management and regular staff, and signs that safety-related messages and behaviours were not effectively implemented across the company.\nThe report was ordered after crashes involving Boeing planes in 2018 and 2019.\nBoeing pledged to review the findings.\n\"We've taken important steps to foster a safety culture that empowers and encourages all employees to share their voice. But there is more work to do,\" the company said.\n\"We will carefully review the panel's assessment and learn from their findings, as we continue our comprehensive efforts to improve our safety and quality programs.\"\nThe company, one of two major global plane makers, has been under added pressure since last month, when a section of one of its passenger jets blew off in mid-air, forcing an emergency landing.\nThe incident, which narrowly avoided serious harm, revived questions about Boeing's manufacturing processes, years after the 2018 and 2019 accidents, which killed 346 people and led to accusations that the company had put profits before safety as it produced its planes.\nThe panel of experts, which was convened after the earlier crashes, said Boeing had taken steps to improve, but that it saw indications of \"gaps in Boeing's safety journey\".\nIt said some Boeing staff were hesitant to report problems and worried about retaliation because of how the reporting process was set up.\nBoeing also did not have a clear system for reporting problems and tracking how those concerns were resolved, it said.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would also review the findings.\nThe agency is currently investigating Boeing's manufacturing processes, triggered by the 5 January blowout. It has barred the company from expanding production of its popular 737 Max planes while the review is under way.\n\"We will continue to hold Boeing to the highest standard of safety and will work to ensure the company comprehensively addresses these recommendations,\" the FAA said as it released the report.\nThe troubles at Boeing are expected to lead to delays delivering new planes to airlines, which Ryanair has said could cause ticket prices to rise. Other airlines have also voiced frustration over the issues.\nEarlier this month, Boeing said it was replacing the person in charge of the 737 Max programme and creating a new position of senior vice president for quality.",

    "Spain is reeling from the news that five people have died and up to 15 people are missing after a fire engulfed a high-rise apartment block in the city of Valencia.\nThe blaze engulfed a 14-storey building in the Campanar neighbourhood and spread to an adjoining block.\nThere are already questions being asked as to whether the way the building was constructed could have enabled the fire to spread quickly.\nHere's what we know so far.\nHow did the fire start?\nThe fire began on Thursday evening on the fourth floor of the building. The cause of the fire is not yet known.\nThe blaze spread to an adjoining building as high winds fanned the flames.\nFirefighters managed to rescue some of the building's residents last night, but so far have only been able to access up to the third floor, due to the high temperatures.\nDrones have spent the night and this morning flying over and around the structure to help with the search.\nA family of four, including a three-year-old boy and a 15-day-old baby girl, are reportedly among those missing.\nSpanish media are calling it the worst fire recorded in Valencia.\nDid cladding enable the fire to spread?\nExperts have suggested that cladding on the outside of the building could have been a factor in enabling the fire to spread rapidly.\nCladding is added to the facade of modern buildings to keep the weather at bay. Behind the panels there is usually an air space to help insulation and prevent damp.\nEsther Puchades, vice president of the College of Industrial Technical Engineers of Valencia, told Spanish news agency Efe she had previously inspected the building.\nShe said its exterior featured a polyurethane material, which is no longer in wide use because of fears over flammability. It also has an aluminium covering.\n\"The reason the [building] burned so fast is because of this type of cladding,\" she told Spanish media.\nThe cladding has been described by experts as effective for heat insulation but the ventilation, or gap, between it and the covering means it can be highly flammable.\nLuis Sendra, of Valencia's architects' association, said this can cause a \"chimney effect\", allowing fires to spread more quickly.\nThe specific type of cladding on the buildings in Valencia is still unclear, and some types of cladding are more flammable than others.\nA 2007 promotional video by the building's developer mentioned the \"innovative material\" used to clad the building's exterior, which passed \"rigorous quality checks\".\nThe issue of flammable cladding gained prominence in the UK after the 2017 Grenfell Tower disaster, in which 72 people died when a tower block in west London caught fire.\nWhat do we know about building?\nThe blocks are in the Campanar neighbourhood, one of the most affluent areas of Spain's third biggest city.\nSome 450 people are believed to live there, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.\nThe building was built in 2008-09 and had 138 apartments, it said.\nThe developer Fbex began constructing the building in 2005, in the middle of the real estate bubble, but the company filed for bankruptcy five years later, elDiario.es reports.\nPilar Bernabe, the government's representative in Valencia, said it was hard to say how many people were missing because it was \"a building with many flats, flats in which there were people of foreign nationality, whose location is more difficult to pinpoint\".",
    "The Odysseus Moon lander is probably lying on its side with its head resting against a rock.\nThe US spacecraft, which made history on Thursday by becoming the first ever privately built and operated robot to complete a soft lunar touchdown, is otherwise in good condition.\nIts owner, Texan firm Intuitive Machines, says Odysseus has plenty of power and is communicating with Earth.\nControllers are trying to retrieve pictures from the robot.\nSteve Altemus, the CEO and co-founder of IM, said it wasn't totally clear what had happened but the data suggested the robot caught a foot on the surface and then fell because it still had some lateral motion at the moment of landing.\nAnother possibility is that Odysseus broke a leg as it came down. Certainly, inertial measurement sensors indicate the body of the vehicle to be in a horizontal pose.\nWhatever the reason for the unexpected landed configuration, radio antennas are still pointing at Earth and solar cells continue to collect energy to charge the battery system.\nFortuitously, all the scientific instruments that planned to take observations on the Moon are on the side of Odysseus facing up, which should allow them to do some work. The only payload on the \"wrong side\" of the lander, pointing down at the lunar surface, is a static art project.\n\"We're hopeful to get pictures and really do an assessment of the structure and assessment of all the external equipment,\" Mr Altemus told reporters.\n\"So far, we have quite a bit of operational capability even though we're tipped over. And so that's really exciting for us, and we are continuing the surface operations mission as a result of it.\"\nThe robot had been directed to a cratered terrain near the Moon's south pole, and the IM team believes it got very close to the targeted site, perhaps within 2km or 3km.\nA US space agency satellite called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will search for Odysseus this weekend to confirm its whereabouts.\nThe IM mission is part of Nasa's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) programme, in which the agency is paying various private American companies for cargo services to the Moon - in the case of Odysseus with a fee of $118M (\u00c2\u00a393m).\nAll the companies are responsible for the financing, build, launch and operation of their spacecraft - and for finding commercial payloads to supplement Nasa's.\nSix CLPS missions were planned for this year. The first, by Pittsburgh-based firm Astrobotic, ended in failure. Its Peregrine lander developed technical problems en route to the Moon and gave up the opportunity of a touchdown. The robot was brought back to burn up in Earth's atmosphere.\nIntuitive Machines has two further missions in prospect for 2024. The next will see a robot drill into the surface. Another Texan company, Firefly Aerospace, should also shoot for the Moon at some point in the coming months.\nNasa regards the CLPS approach as a more economical way of getting its science done, while at the same time seeding what it hopes will become a thriving lunar economy.\nJoel Kearns, from the agency's science mission directorate, described the Odysseus landing as a \"gigantic accomplishment\", and an affirmation of the CLPS policy.\nIrrespective of its current functionality, Odysseus is unlikely to work much beyond the beginning of March when darkness will fall on the landing site.\n\"Once the Sun sets on 'Oddie', the batteries will attempt to keep the vehicle warm and alive but eventually it'll fall into a deep cold and then the electronics that we produce just won't survive the deep cold of lunar night.

    "The boyfriend of a US-Russian citizen detained in Russia on suspicion of treason has called on the US government to help bring her home.\nKsenia Karelina, 33, was detained by Russian authorities in Yekaterinburg after travelling there on a family visit last month.\nShe was also accused of fundraising for Ukraine's armed forces.\nChris Van Heerden said his partner would be appearing in court on Thursday ahead of a trial beginning in April.\nShe was, he told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme, a \"normal American citizen that made a mistake\".\n\"She was so naive, she doesn't watch the news, she said, 'Chris look, I'm Russian, I'm safe, nothing is going to happen to me',\" he said.\nHe described her as \"proud to be Russian\" - so proud about where she was from that she was comfortable travelling there.\nRussia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said an unnamed woman had been arrested for collecting money for the Ukrainian military since February 2022 - when Russia first launched its full-scale invasion.\n\"She didn't want to engage in conversation when it came to the war,\" Mr Van Heerden added.\nFootage shared by Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti showed a woman, whose face was obscured by a hat and blurred out, being escorted by a uniformed officer.\nShe was seen being handcuffed and placed into a car, before being led into what appeared to be a holding cell in a courtroom, from which she was eventually led out.\nMr Van Heerden, a professional boxer, said he was \"so scared\" for Ms Karelina when he saw the footage.\n\"I broke down because I know Ksenia, she is a sweetheart, she's so soft and I cannot imagine for the life of me how scared she must be,\" he said.\nHe said she had sent a love letter from the pre-trial confinement centre where she was being held, in which she described oscillating from being full of motivation one day to hopeless another.\nMs Karelina was \"prepared for what might be the fight of her life as she might be in there forever\", he added.\n\"I want to let people know that Ksenia is a normal person, that's my job. She's a normal American citizen that made a mistake,\" he said.\n\"I'm in a fight right now totally out of my control, I'm in a fight that I'm not familiar with. I'm trying my very best to do as much as I can.\"\nMr Van Heerden hopes that by shining a light on the case he will put pressure on the US government to help secure his partner's release.\nBefore Ms Karelina was identified in reports, the White House said it was aware of the reported arrest and had been trying to get more information.\nLast week, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the White House and state department were trying to \"secure some consular access to that individual\".\nThe FSB said the woman had been detained in Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow - the same city in which US journalist Evan Gershkovich was arrested on charges of espionage on 29 March last year.\nIn April last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree increasing the maximum sentence for treason to life in jail, up from 20 years, as part of a crackdown on dissent.",
    "King Charles has issued a strongly-worded message of support for Ukraine, in a statement marking the second anniversary of Russia's invasion.\nHe has spoken of the \"indescribable aggression\" that has faced Ukrainians since what he calls the \"unprovoked attack on their land\".\nThe unusually direct message seems to be a rallying call to keep up international assistance for Ukraine.\nThe King welcomed the continuing support from the UK and its allies.\nAt a time when there have been some doubts over financial and military aid for Ukraine, particularly from some politicians in the United States, King Charles commended the international support for Ukraine at a time of \"great suffering and need\".\nKing Charles spoke of the military training being provided in the UK for Ukrainian soldiers and praised the efforts of the country's President Zelensky.\nAs the war enters a third year, the King made no secret of his sympathies, hailing the \"determination and strength of the Ukrainian people\".\n\"Despite the tremendous hardship and pain inflicted upon them, Ukrainians continue to show the heroism with which the world associates them so closely.  Theirs is true valour, in the face of indescribable aggression,\" said the King's statement.\nThe war in Ukraine has been close to the King's heart. In the early stages of the conflict he made a surprise visit to meet Ukrainian refugees who had fled across the border into Romania.\nHe has visited the Ukrainian community in the UK and on a state visit to France last year, the King told the Senate of the importance of a Ukrainian victory against Russia's \"horrifying\" invasion, so that \"our cherished freedoms will prevail\".\nIt's unusual for the King to speak so unambiguously about an international conflict and his comments reflect the strength of his feeling.\nThis latest personal intervention on Ukraine comes as the King is receiving treatment for cancer. He has stepped back from public events, but is continuing to work in his role as head of state.\nThe King's statement, which would have been made in consultation with ministers, follows the announcement by the UK of further sanctions against Russia.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak, who visited Kyiv last month to sign a new security agreement and announce \u00c2\u00a32.5bn of military aid to Ukraine over the coming year, said \"we must renew our determination\" on this \"grim anniversary\".\nThe comments come as hundreds of pro-Ukraine demonstrators gathered at Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park and then marched to Trafalgar Square, where a vigil was held.\nDemonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the Russian invasion are also being held in other parts of the UK including George Square in Glasgow.\nOlha Plyushch, who arrived in the UK as a refugee with her 14-year-old daughter, has been managing the English School for Displaced Ukrainians at the Ukrainian Institute London.\nSpeaking at the demonstration, she said the school has provided free lessons to more than 1,000 refuges since it was established in May 2022.\n\"The English we learnt back in Ukraine is very different to the language the natives speak in the UK.\"\nMany Ukrainians want to find a job and rent a place, so as \"not to abuse the kindness of the British hosts\", she said.\nOn 18 February the UK government launched the Ukraine permission extension scheme - it means those who have already been given permission to be in the UK under one of the existing Ukraine schemes will be able to apply for a further 18 months' permission to stay in the UK.\nAdditional reporting by Olga Malchevska.",

    "Donald Trump has said he supports the availability of IVF treatment, joining a growing number of Republicans who are seeking to distance themselves from an Alabama court ruling on the issue.\nThe state's top court ruled last week that frozen embryos have the same rights as children and people can be held liable for destroying them.\nAt least three clinics paused IVF treatment in the wake of the ruling.\nOn Friday, Mr Trump called on Alabama to find \"an immediate solution\".\n\"We want to make it easier for mothers and fathers to have babies, not harder! That includes supporting the availability of fertility treatments like IVF in every State in America,\" the former president wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\"[Like] the VAST MAJORITY of Republicans, Conservatives, Christians, and Pro-Life Americans, I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby,\" he added.\nEarlier on Friday, in an apparent effort to ease concerns in the state, Alabama's Republican Attorney General Steve Marshall said he did not intend to prosecute IVF providers or their families.\nMr Trump's comments were his first on the issue, and signalled his opposition to a ruling which some Republicans fear could harm them electorally by hindering plans to win back suburban women as well as swing voters.\nMr Trump is the front-runner to win the Republican nomination for November's election and arguably the leading voice in the party.\nIn a further sign of the party's efforts to distance itself from the Alabama ruling, the National Republican Senate Committee, which helps members get elected to Congress, sent out a memo to candidates on Friday which directed them to express support for IVF and \"campaign on increasing access\" to the treatment.\n\"There are zero Republican Senate candidates who support efforts to restrict access to fertility treatments,\" the committee's executive director, Jason Thielman, wrote in the memo which was obtained by the BBC's US partner, CBS.\nThe memo also cited internal polling conducted by Kellyanne Conway, a one-time White House adviser to Mr Trump, to show access to IVF is overwhelmingly popular.\nA number of Senate candidates, including Kari Lake in Arizona, came out to publicly support access to the treatment after the memo was circulated.\nMr Trump's only challenger for the Republican nomination, Nikki Haley, initially appeared to back the ruling after she said she considers frozen embryos to be babies. She later denied that she supported the court's decision.\nWhile the Alabama ruling does not ban or restrict IVF, several medical providers in the state cited fears of legal repercussions as they paused fertility services in recent days.\nIt was made by the state's Supreme Court and all of its justices are Republican.\nDemocrats are already incorporating the Alabama case into campaigning, portraying it as a warning that their rivals will seek to chip away at women's rights if they win in the November election.\nMr Biden said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the Alabama decision was only possible because of the 2022 ruling by the US Supreme Court - which has three Trump appointees - to nullify abortion rights.\nWhile many conservatives celebrated the end of Roe v Wade, it proved a potent get-out-the-vote motivator for Democrats and a messaging nightmare for Republicans.",
    "The family of a man killed in a freak accident more than a year ago say they are still looking for answers.\nKevin Holding, 60, was crushed when a pop-up urinal he was working on in Soho dropped suddenly, on 27 January 2023.\nHis daughter Karlie, 36, described him as \"the life and soul of the family and the glue that held us together\".\nThe Met Police admitted it \"has not provided the family with the support they would expect during the past year\".\nIn an exclusive interview with the BBC, Ms Holding criticised a lack of communication from the authorities, saying: \"I wouldn't want any family to go through how we've been dealt with.\"\nThe maintenance engineer, from Beckenham in south-east London, was left trapped underneath the telescopic urinal, which dropped on him while he was working on the device, last February's inquest was told .\nPop-up public loos were introduced in central London in 2002 to discourage street urination. During the day, they are stored beneath the pavement and at night they rise hydraulically.\nThe inquest heard the emergency services reached the scene, at the junction between Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road, at about 13:05 GMT but a crane to help lift the urinal took more than two hours to arrive.\nThe 60-year-old was identified by his Oyster card.\nHis daughter paid tribute to \"a big, friendly giant\". She said: \"I don't want him to be remembered as the man that was killed by the toilet.\n\"He was such a big character and he did everything for everyone, even for all our friends, as well as family.\n\"If they phoned him and said, 'Kevin, can you come and help me?' he'd be there in a shot. He wouldn't see anyone without help.\n\"We were very lucky to have him in our life.\"\nMs Holding, who lives in Kent, criticised a lack of communication from the Metropolitan Police and Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which are investigating the circumstances of her father's death.\n\"It's been absolutely disgusting how we've been treated for such a public incident that was completely out of my dad's control,\" the personal assistant told the BBC.\n\"There's a million questions that we would like answering. They have just left the family with no answers, no support, no financial support.\n\"None of the parties are taking liability and all we want is answers.\"\nDet Ch Insp Dean Purvis, from the Metropolitan Police, said: \"I have recently reviewed our investigation into this tragic death, and it is clear that we have not provided the family with the support they would expect during the past year.\n\"This is a matter of regret to me and I will contact them to discuss their concerns and answer any questions they have regarding the status of the investigation, especially why it appears to be taking a long time to establish what happened.\"\nThe family also wants Mr Holding's phone to be returned but the Met said \"it is vital\" to keep the device until the investigation concludes.\nWestminster City Council, which has responsibility for the pop-up toilets in the area, said its \"deepest sympathies are with Mr Holding's family and friends following his tragic death\".\nAn HSE spokesperson said: \"We understand the family's concerns and while we are still investigating the incident, primacy remains with the Metropolitan Police. Inquiries at our specialist site in Buxton are ongoing.\n\"We are committed to maintaining regular contact with Mr Holding's family in line with this police-led investigation.

They always say, 'Give it a year and a day and things will get better' but they don't.\n\"It's just really hard as a family.

    "The way music megastar Taylor Swift changes her accent has become the focus of academic scrutiny.\nA team from The University of Chester has examined how her drawl alters when she performs different musical genres.\nDr Helen West, Senior Lecturer in English language/linguistics, and English graduate, Esther Humphries compared earlier and later Swift styles.\nTheir findings were presented to an online symposium on the artiste.\nSwift's fanbase has previously discussed how Swift sang with a Southern or Tennessee accent on her earlier recordings, but has a more northern USA tone on her more recent work, the university said.\nSwiftposium\nTheir online paper - the only one to look at this facet of the singer - was made to the Swiftposium academic conference, at the University of Melbourne and was among 130 selected from more than 400 submissions.\nDr West said: \"Taylor's accent changes between her country and pop music styles has generated quite a lot of public attention, but, until our research, it had not been analysed in any depth.\n\"The results reveal significant stylisation dependent on the musical genre Swift performs, with Southern American English accent forms more prevalent in her earlier country-style music.\n\"Her popular-style performances demonstrate a transition to Northern American accent forms.\n\"However, while there is clear evidence of accent shift between the two genres for all the accent sounds investigated, our results reveal that the shift between the genres is more subtle than we had hypothesised, with Swift using less perceptible Southern accent forms in her country area, rather than some of the features that index (are very recognisable in) a Southern American accent.\"\nMiss Humphries added: \"These results suggest that Swift is not performing the accent simply for her music but indicate a form of bilingualism, with some linguistic awareness.\n\"The changes could be attributed to a range of factors including her immersion into the Nashville/South American English speech community, having moved to Nashville at the age of 14, and they could also carry some social meaning about 'countryness', youth culture and lack of pretension.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "A deadly stampede outside a passport office that took two lives and unending lines outside embassies - these are just some examples of what has been happening in Myanmar since the announcement of mandatory conscription into the military.\nMyanmar's military government is facing increasingly effective opposition to its rule and has lost large areas of the country to armed resistance groups.\nOn 1 February 2021, the military seized power in a coup, jailing elected leaders and plunging much of the country into a bloody civil war that continues today.\nThousands have been killed and the UN estimates that around 2.6 million people been displaced.\nYoung Burmese, many of whom have played a leading role protesting and resisting the junta, are now told they will have to fight for the regime.\nMany believe that this is a result of the setbacks suffered by the military in recent months, with anti-government groups uniting to defeat them in some key areas.\n\"It is nonsense to have to serve in the military at this time, because we are not fighting foreign invaders. We are fighting each other. If we serve in the military, we will be contributing to their atrocities,\" Robert, a 24-year-old activist, told the BBC.\nMany of them are seeking to leave the country instead.\n\"I arrived at 03:30 [20:30 GMT] and there were already about 40 people queuing for the tokens to apply for their visa,\" recalled a teenage girl who was part of a massive crowd outside the Thai embassy in Yangon earlier in February. Within an hour, the crowd in front of the embassy expanded to more than 300 people, she claims.\n\"I was scared that if I waited any longer, the embassy would suspend the processing of visas amid the chaos,\" she told the BBC, adding that some people had to wait for three days before even getting a queue number.\nIn Mandalay, where the two deaths occurred outside the passport office, the BBC was told that there were also serious injuries - one person broke their leg after falling into a drain while another broke their teeth. Six others reported breathing difficulties.\nJustine Chambers, a Myanmar researcher at the Danish Institute of International Studies, says mandatory conscription is a way of removing young civilians leading the revolution.\n\"We can analyse how the conscription law is a sign of the Myanmar military's weakness, but it is ultimately aimed at destroying lives... Some will manage to escape, but many will become human shields against their compatriots,\" she said.\nMyanmar's conscription law was first introduced in 2010 but had not been enforced until on 10 February the junta said it would mandate at least two years of military service for all men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27.\nMaj-Gen Zaw Min Tun, the spokesperson for the military government, said in a statement that about a quarter of the country's 56 million population were eligible for military service under the law.\nThe regime later said it did not plan to include women in the conscript pool \"at present\" but did not specify what that meant.\nThe government spokesperson told BBC Burmese that call-ups would start after the Thingyan festival marking the Burmese New Year in mid-April, with an initial batch of 5,000 recruits.\nThe regime's announcement has dealt yet another blow to Myanmar's young people.\nMany had their education disrupted by the coup, which came on top of school closures at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIn 2021, the junta suspended 145,000 teachers and university staff over their support for the opposition, according to the Myanmar Teachers' Federation, and some schools in opposition-held areas have been destroyed by the fighting or by air strikes.\nThen there are those who have fled across borders seeking refuge, among them young people looking for jobs to support their families.\nIn response to the conscription law, some have said on social media that they would enter the monkhood or get married early to dodge military service.\nThe junta says permanent exemptions will be given to members of religious orders, married women, people with disabilities, those assessed to be unfit for military service and \"those who are exempted by the conscription board\". For everyone else, evading conscription is punishable by three to five years in prison and a fine.\nBut Robert doubts the regime will honour these exemptions. \"The junta can arrest and abduct anyone they want. There is no rule of law and they do not have to be accountable to anyone,\" he said.\nWealthier families are considering moving their families abroad - Thailand and Singapore being popular options, but some are even looking as far afield as Iceland - with the hope that their children would get permanent residency or citizenship there by the time they are of conscription age.\nOthers have instead joined the resistance forces, said Aung Sett, from the All Burma Federation of Student Unions, which has a long history of fighting military rule.\n\"When I heard the news that I would have to serve in the milit",

I could not absorb the numbers on the page,\" she said.\n\"We need to share more knowledge and information among women.\n\"After taking the class, I'm excited about the road ahead.\"\nMs Chiren added there was a reason that the age group of 45 to 55 are seen to quit their jobs, get divorces and even experience a higher rate of suicide and it is all because of a lack of understanding about the menopause.\n\"We are only halfway through our adult life when we are menopausal and it is an incredible opportunity for people to really think where they are and what they want to do and gather that support around them.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook , X and Instagram .

The BBC spoke to two former boxers trying to rebuild their lives after brain injuries.\n\"I came close to losing my life,\" said 29-year-old Luis Palmer, who has no recollection of the night his life changed forever.\nLuis was fast making a reputation as a party-spoiler who would upset the script boxing in the away corner.\nBut he was knocked out in the fifth round during a fight in Glasgow in April 2022 and spent the next five days in an induced coma.\nAfter just four professional fights, his boxing career was over.\n\"Everyday life since then has been difficult,\" said the father-of-three from Sheffield.\n\"It's difficult to know my fighting journey has come to an end.\"\nLuis began boxing aged 18 and dreamt of becoming a world champion.\n\"I was fighting for my kids,\" he said.\n\"When you are fighting for your family, for a reason, and then you have a setback, it's difficult to restart.\"\nLuis is a former stablemate of Sheffield boxer Scott Westgarth, who was fatally injured in the ring in February 2018 .\nHe knew the potential dangers of the sport long before he made his debut in 2022.\n\"As boxers, you know what you are getting into,\" said Luis, who boxed at cruiserweight.\n\"It's just the difficult realisation when you are actually living it.\"\nLuis's mum Michelle rushed straight to Glasgow from the family home in Sheffield when she found out her only child was fighting for his life.\n'Can't come back without him'\nShe described the days spent by his side praying he would wake up as \"the worst of my life\".\n\"I just remember the feeling in my stomach when I first saw him on the hospital bed, lifeless. I couldn't imagine if he would get back up again.\n\"When I got up to Glasgow I thought 'You can't come back to Sheffield without him because life wouldn't be worth living'.\"\nMichelle became her son's primary carer in the weeks and months following his injury.\n\"He was fully dependent on me at one stage for at least six months,\" she said.\n\"I had to cook and clean for him. That was hard to get used to again.\"\nAs part of his recovery, he was introduced to fellow Sheffield fighter Jerome Wilson, who suffered a life-changing brain injury 10 years ago.\nJerome had a titanium plate fitted in his skull and had to learn how to eat again. He continues to endure excruciating pain.\n\"The other day I was crouched up in a ball because I felt like my head was going to explode,\" the 39-year-old father-of-two said.\n\"I have pain every day.\n\"The experience I'm having to deal with, that Luis is having to deal with, that can break a lot of people.\"\nBoth men suffer with short-term memory loss, headaches and mood swings among a long and growing list of symptoms.\n\"It affects your relationships with people,\" said Luis.\n\"For the first seven nights [when I woke up] I couldn't walk, I didn't want to talk to anyone.\"\nJonny Powls, a clinical psychologist at the Sheffield Community Brain Injury Rehabilitation Team, which has supported both men, said a brain injury could have a \"lifetime impact\".\n\"Rehab is a lot more about developing strategies to minimise the impact that these injuries have on everyday life,\" he said.\nLuis said he was a \"highly functioning individual\" before his injury.\nAs well as boxing, he was studying for a degree in occupational health.\n\"Now, I'm more or less classed as disabled. That change of identity can be frustrating, not being able to do everything I used to.\n\"I'm still very dependent on my mum and my family.\n\"Without my mum I don't think I would still be here.\"\n\"I see us as champions,\" added Jerome, who returned to full-time work, as an employability tutor, for the first time since his injury 18 months ago.\n\"Not everyone can do that. I have got a lot of pride in it,\" added the former welterweight.\n\"I have ups and downs and I'm OK with that. It's not an easy life to live, but I'm grateful to live it. I don't take things for granted.\"\nLuis has resumed his degree and is now in the final year of his studies. He wants to use boxing with occupational therapy patients in future and has his own sports massage therapy business.\n\"It's a big shame I can't box,\" he said. \"At the same time I'm just happy I'm here for my kids.\n\"I'm going to do whatever I can to give my boys a stable future, as well as having me here to support them.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "The RSPCA is seeking new homes for four 14-week-old kittens that were thrown from a car in Sheffield.\nThe charity said they were dumped in a box near Herdings Park Woods at about 11:30 GMT on 15 February.\nA council worker who witnessed the incident reported a couple had abandoned the animals and fled the scene, the RSPCA said.\nThe charity is appealing for homes for the kittens, and is investigating to trace those responsible.\nIt said the council worker went to the kittens' aid and took them to the RSPCA Sheffield Animal Centre in Attercliffe, where they have recovered and are now ready for adoption.\nAnimal care assistant Hayley Crookes said: \"A council worker was parked in a layby when he saw a vehicle drive to the entrance of the park and a couple got out and threw a box into the woods before they sped away.\n\"He was worried about what was inside the box so rushed to retrieve it and found the scared kittens inside so brought them into our care.\n\"He was quite shocked about what he had seen and, as an animal lover, was so focused on getting help he didn't take note of the make and model of the car but said it was a couple in their 40s who were responsible.\n\"We are now appealing to find the people responsible as we are worried they may have other animals in their care which need help and we don't want another horrific situation like this.\"\nThe three males and one female have been given cheese-themed names by the staff - Gouda, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella and Emmental.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Six puppies have been rescued by Wiltshire Council after they were abandoned by the side of a road.\nThe eight-week-old crossbreeds were found by a member of the public in the Ashton Keynes area of Wiltshire on Monday.\nNick Holder, public protection cabinet member for the authority, said the puppies were possibly a poodle cross.\nHe added that if no one came forward to claim them, they would be rehomed through Bath Cats and Dogs Home.\nThe fawn-coloured litter of puppies were spotted at the roadside in the village of Leigh.\nThe council said the dogs were a mix of sexes but none of the animals had been microchipped.\nMr Holder added the dogs weighed between 3kgs (6.6lbs) and 4.5kgs (9.9lbs ) and all appeared to be healthy.\n\"We will hold them in our stray kennels for seven days, which is a legal requirement, and if no one comes forward to claim them they will be rehomed through Bath Cats and Dogs Home who we work closely with for all our stray dogs,\" he said.\n\"The puppies all have potential adopters.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "A waste company has been fined for causing liquid cyanide to leak from a truck at an industrial estate in Derbyshire.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00afJ&G Environmental Ltd pleaded guilty to causing the illegal water discharge in Heanor.\nOn 6 February 2018, the liquid escaped from a ruptured tank into nearby ponds, which is estimated by the Environment Agency to have killed hundreds of fish.\nThe firm was fined \u00c2\u00a316,000 at Nottingham Crown Court on Wednesday.\nIt was also ordered to pay an additional \u00c2\u00a352,500 in costs.\nThe Environment Agency said the container was ruptured at Heanor Gate Industrial Estate as the driver started moving it around, having borrowed a forklift truck.\nHundreds of litres of a liquid, which contained diluted cyanide, began to escape on to the floor before entering the drainage system and natural waterways.\nThe fire service cordoned off the area and ensured anyone involved in the incident was fully washed down.\n'Serious pollution'\nThe Environment Agency prosecuted the company, estimating clear-up costs were approximately \u00c2\u00a350,000 after officers tried to stop the flow of water from nearby ponds.\nOfficers took samples of the dead fish, sending 73 off for testing. All were found to have died from cyanide poisoning.\nThe agency said Judge Michael Auty sentenced the company, based in Fareham, Hampshire, noting it had no previous convictions and had pleaded guilty on 29 January.\nIt added the judge also took into account the efforts made by the company to ensure a similar incident was not repeated and its contributions to recycling and environmental welfare.\nThe agency said the judge commented it was unfortunate the driver had been unable to provide any detail of the nature of the liquid being transported and that the absence of personal protective equipment created a risk to its employees.\nA spokesperson said: \"We welcome this sentence as this was a serious pollution which caused considerable disruption besides fish deaths.\n\"The Environment Agency will pursue any company that fails to uphold the law or protect nature and will continue to press for the strongest possible penalties.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "An agricultural policy will be reviewed, the Welsh government has said, ahead of a protest at the Senedd.\nFarmers are unhappy with proposals to change farm subsidies, which would include a requirement for 10% of agricultural land to be used for trees.\nThey would also be required to earmark another 10% for wildlife habitat, and plan to protest in Cardiff Bay.\nThe Welsh government has been criticised for not listening to their concerns.\nFarmers have held protests across Wales in the last few weeks, including a convoy of 100 tractors and farm vehicles in a go-slow through Newtown, Powys, during a Labour leadership debate.\nNational Farmers Union Cymru President Aled Jones said Welsh farmers were currently subject to numerous and significant pressures.\n\"There is rising unrest within the Welsh agricultural community and that is manifesting itself in many different forms, including tomorrow's [Wednesday's] demonstration in Cardiff Bay,\" he said in a statement.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has criticised Wales' farm subsidy plans, told protestors \"we've got your back\" when they turned up at the Welsh Conservative conference in Llandudno, Conwy, on Friday.\nA consultation on the Sustainable Farming Scheme is ongoing, but as a result of the strong views already expressed on the issue, the Welsh government has announced a number steps to try and mitigate the concerns of farmers.\nIn a joint statement, the Minister for Rural Affairs Lesley Griffiths and First Minister Mark Drakeford said the environmental requirements of the scheme would be targeted \"at improving the economic resilience of farms\".\n\"Ensuring woodland and habitat requirements do not make farms unviable,\" the statement said.\nIt added other means of capturing carbon, aside from planting trees, will be looked at and that farm payments would be \"distributed fairly and accessible to all\".\nThe 10% figure for trees has been called arbitrary, with many farmers saying it would make their business unviable.\nLast week, Mr Drakeford angered farmers by saying it was not up to farmers how subsidies were spent and blamed those who voted for Brexit for the changes to subsidies.\nHe argued that the farm subsidy scheme was necessary in the fight against climate change.\nBut as farmers prepare to bring their protests to the Senedd, the Welsh government has also announced a review of their policies on tuberculosis (TB) in cattle and agricultural pollution - key concerns for many in the industry.\nMr Drakeford said he recognised the \"devastation\" that TB can bring to a farming family, and will look again at the policy of slaughtering infected cattle on farms.\n\"The slaughter of cattle on farms can be particularly distressing to those who witness it and can have a detrimental impact on farmers' and farmworkers' wellbeing and mental health,\" he said.\nSpeaking in the Senedd chamber, he said his government was committed to dealing with agricultural pollution, stressing that \"in five on the six most affected rivers in Wales, agricultural pollution is the single biggest contributor to the state of the river and we cannot look the other way\".\nBut he also promised a review of agricultural pollution regulations.\u00c2\nPlaid Cymru's rural affairs spokesperson Llyr Gruffydd welcomed the announcements, but said that \"only an unequivocal statement of a pause and a review of the Sustainable Farming Scheme will reassure the sector that the government is genuinely listening and responding meaningfully to the concerns expressed\".\nConservative MS Sam Kurtz said there was a \"growing frustration and anger\" amongst farmers and called on Ms Griffiths to \"pause the consultation and take the heat out of the situation\".\nToday's statement addresses some of the key issues raised by farmers during mass protests in recent weeks.\nAs well as some of the demands made by unions in talks with ministers last week.\nNotably they say they'll consider an \"evidence-based review\" of how farms can soak in carbon - in other words are there other options beside trees?\nAnd there's a hint the introduction of the controversial new post-Brexit subsidy scheme could be delayed.\nThe public consultation closes next week and a new first minister, set to be in post later in March, \"will want to carefully review the results... and consider in detail the pace of implementation\".\nThere's the promise of an extra \u00c2\u00a320m to help farms adhere to stricter regulations on storing and spreading slurry and fertiliser, designed to protect water quality.\nAnd the government's new taskforce on bovine TB - which we already knew about - will be asked to prioritise looking at the emotive issue of infected cattle having to be slaughtered on farm in some instances, in front of their owners.",
    "Voters in Blackpool South will be able to sign a petition to potentially unseat their MP from 12 March.\nThe Commons voted on Tuesday to suspend the MP for 35 days, exceeding the 10-day threshold that triggers a recall petition.\nVoters can sign the petition until 22 April, and if 10% of the electorate signs it a by-election will be held.\nLocations for signing the petition will be released soon.\nA Blackpool council statement confirmed that \"notice was received from the Speaker of the House of Commons that a Recall Petition under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 was to be opened in respect of Scott Benton MP\".\nThe ex-Tory, who is now an independent, broke Commons rules when an undercover investigation by the Times found him offering to lobby ministers and table parliamentary questions on behalf of gambling investors.\n'Resignation call'\nAn independent panel upheld a decision by the Standards Committee, which Mr Benton had appealed against.\nIt said there had been \"no procedural flaw\" in the process.\nMr Benton has previously said he was \"deeply disappointed\" and claimed there had been a \"lack of integrity\" throughout the process, which was \"prone to regular leaks at every stage\".\nHe said he has continued to serve his constituents.\nHe was elected as a Conservative in 2019 with a 3,690 majority.\nLabour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said Mr Benton should resign at once to \"save his constituents the upheaval and cost of a recall petition\".\nA Blackpool South contest would be the fourth by-election this year, and if the Conservatives failed to win in the poll it would be the 11th seat lost by the government since the current Parliament began in 2019.\nAny poll would be unlikely to occur until the end of April or the beginning of May.\nThe BBC has contacted Mr Benton for comment.\nWhy not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Ukraine's president has issued a rallying cry, vowing that his country will prevail, as it marks two years since Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\"None of us will allow our Ukraine to end,\" Volodymyr Zelensky said in an address in the capital Kyiv.\nHe was joined by Western leaders in a show of solidarity.\nThe anniversary comes as Ukraine experiences a range of setbacks in its efforts to expel Russia from its territory.\nMr Zelensky said in his speech on Saturday that while any normal person would want the war to end, it could only be on Ukraine's terms.\n\"That's why, to the words 'end of the war', we always add 'on our terms'. That's why the word 'peace' always goes with 'fair'.\n\"We are fighting for it. For 730 days of our lives already. And we will win on the best day of our life.\"\nJoining him in Kyiv were the leaders of Italy, Belgium and Canada - as well as the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.\nThey laid wreaths at a wall commemorating those who have lost their lives in the war.\nHowever, there were some glaring omissions among the visitors. No senior US representatives were present, whereas last year President Joe Biden attended the anniversary.\nMr Zelensky did meet a group of Democratic senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Friday, though, which he said was a sign Washington backed Ukraine.\nMs von der Leyen praised the Ukrainian troops who defended the country in the early days of the invasion and confounded expectations about their ability to withhold Russia's invasion force.\n\"You managed to stop Russia's attack to the heart of Ukraine. You saved your country, you saved all of Europe,\" she said.\nItaly and Canada used the anniversary visit to announce that they had signed bilateral security pacts with Kyiv - meant to boost Ukraine's hopes of becoming a member of the Nato military alliance.\nLater, members of the G7 - including Canada, Italy, the UK and US - pledged support for Ukraine and new sanctions on Russia during a virtual meeting.\nMarches have also been held across Europe in solidarity with Ukraine. Participants demanded that Russian President Vladimir Putin end the war.\nAt least four people were reportedly detained in Moscow on Saturday at a protest against the war, organised by wives of mobilised soldiers.\nSuch demonstrations are rare as there are several laws in place now in Russia that punish dissent.\nThe anniversary of Russia's invasion comes at a difficult time for Ukraine. Only a week ago, it announced that troops had withdrawn from the embattled town of Avdiivka - one of Russia's biggest wins for months.\nThe failure of Ukraine's counter-offensive and issues over securing further aid from the US have also been big setbacks.\nMeanwhile, the fighting continues. At least four people were killed during the latest Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities.\nKyiv said it had hit one of Russia's largest steel plants in a drone attack early on Saturday.\nUkraine has made some gains in the war - sinking Russian warships and reportedly downing spy planes - but the victory President Zelensky has promised still seems far away.",
    "US daytime talk show legend Wendy Williams Hunter was diagnosed last year with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), her care team has revealed.\nThe team said it was sharing the news \"to correct inaccurate and hurtful rumours about her health\".\nMs Williams, 59, hosted the popular, nationally syndicated Wendy Williams Show for over a decade.\nBut it ended in 2022 amid the health struggles she has been facing.\nThe news of her diagnosis comes a day after a People Magazine cover story, in which relatives said Ms Williams is at a care facility in an unknown location and has been in a shocking health \"spiral\".\n\"As Wendy's fans are aware, in the past she has been open with the public about her medical struggles with Graves' Disease and Lymphedema as well as other significant challenges related to her health,\" her care team wrote in a statement on Thursday.\n\"Over the past few years, questions have been raised at times about Wendy's ability to process information and many have speculated about Wendy's condition, particularly when she began to lose words, act erratically at times, and have difficulty understanding financial transactions.\"\nThe team added Ms Williams' diagnosis was confirmed by \"a battery of medical tests\" last year.\nAphasia is a nervous system syndrome that affects the ability to communicate, with patients often struggling to express thoughts and even losing their ability to speak or write.\nFTD is an incurable brain disorder caused by damage to the left side of the brain that affects language and communication abilities. Its symptoms, which get worse over time, can be managed but there is no treatment that can slow or prevent their progression, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) say.\nThe rare disease tends to strike people at a younger age than other forms of dementia, with most diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 64 years old.\nMs Williams' progression mirrors that of Hollywood icon Bruce Willis who was diagnosed in 2022 with aphasia and then FTD last year.\nIn its statement, the New Jersey native's care team said FTD has \"already presented significant hurdles\" but Ms Williams \"is still able to do many things for herself\".\n\"Most importantly she maintains her trademark sense of humour and is receiving the care she requires to make sure she is protected and that her needs are addressed,\" they wrote.\nThe talk show host, who turns 60 in July, began her career in radio as a DJ and shock jock in New York.\nBut she made a name for herself as the host of The Wendy Williams Show from 2008 to 2021. Ms Williams' hosting style, candid remarks and on-air spats live on as viral moments on the Internet.\nConcerns over Ms Williams' health have swirled for years.\nIn 2017, she fainted in the middle of a Halloween episode.\nA series of guest hosts had to step in for Ms Williams while she was out on medical leave to address Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder, back in 2021.\nProducers cancelled the show the next year. Ms Williams was placed under a financial guardianship a few months later, after the Wells Fargo bank argued she was \"incapacitated\".\nThe Lifetime network - which has previously aired a documentary titled Wendy Williams: What a Mess - is set to release another two-part documentary called Where is Wendy Williams? this weekend.\nThe decision to go public was made to advocate for compassion toward their client and to raise awareness for others with the condition, her care team said.\nNot all physicians recognise the condition, so FTD patients are often misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all, according to the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration.\nStigma and misunderstanding may also result from a patient's behavioural changes.",
    "A man who stabbed and strangled his mother to death at her home after she tried to seek mental health support for him has been given a hospital order.\nHelen Harrison, 59, was discovered fatally injured in Aspen Close, Market Weighton, on 5 March last year.\nRick Parker, 40, was charged with her murder but was found to be unfit to plead due to mental health issues, Hull Crown Court heard.\nThe judge said the order would allow for him to get the treatment he needed.\nThe court previously heard that the defendant had developed mental health issues following a road accident.\nOn the day of her death, Ms Harrison had called for an ambulance to get him some treatment, the court heard.\nShe wanted him to have a mental health assessment, but the attending paramedics said he appeared to be calm and it was not possible to make him leave against his will, said prosecutors.\nGeraldine Kelly, prosecuting, said: \"It must have been very soon after the ambulance left that Rick Parker attacked and killed his mother.\"\nShortly afterwards, the court was told, Parker had called 999 and told call handlers it was \"definitely a body-bag job\".\nWhen paramedics arrived, Parker directed them to the hallway where his mother lay dead and told police the weapon - a large kitchen knife - was still embedded in her shoulder, the court heard.\nTwo weeks earlier, Parker had launched \"an unprovoked attack\" on his stepfather after he overheard an argument which had upset his mother, Ms Kelly said.\nThe case was heard as a trial of the facts, so the jury was not required to return a verdict of guilty or not guilty.\nInstead they were asked to decide whether or not the accused committed the offences with which he had been charged.\nThe jury concluded Parker had killed his mother and attacked his stepfather.\nJudge John Thackray KC told the court that his \"only option was to pass a hospital order\".\nHe told Parker he would be transferred to Rampton high-security psychiatric hospital in Nottinghamshire where \"they will give you the treatment you require\".\nSpeaking after the hearing, Det Supt Nicola Burnett, from Humberside Police, said: \"This has been an incredibly difficult investigation that has left a family utterly devastated.\n\"I would like to thank them for their dignity throughout the proceedings and my thoughts remain with them today.\n\"They have been through a harrowing tribulation and ask that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.\"\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) , and Instagram .

    "In certain places at certain times, just staying alive is something for a boy to be proud of - let alone going out every day to find the food that keeps your family from starving.\nEvery morning, Mohammed Zo'rab, 11, goes out into the southern Gaza city of Rafah on a mission.\nHe takes a big plastic bowl and heads to schools that have become refugee centres, and to makeshift camps on the roadside where people suffer like his own family but might still find something to feed the child of strangers.\nMohammed also goes to hospitals where the wounded arrive at all hours, and anywhere else where there might be a pot boiling over an open fire.\n\"When I go back to my family with this food, they get happy and we all eat together,\" he says.\n\"Sometimes I go empty handed and I feel sad.\"\nMohammed is the eldest of four children and lives with his mother, father and his siblings in a flimsy shelter made of plastic and tarpaulin.\nHis father, Khaled, roams around Rafah looking for odd jobs to raise five shekels (about $1.38; \u00c2\u00a31.08) to buy nappies for their two-month-old daughter, Howaida.\nMohammed is one of thousands of children who have become primary food gatherers for their families.\n\"When the line is crowded and there are almost 100 people in front of me, I sneak between people,\" he says, proud of his skill at navigating large crowds without getting into fights.\nBack at home, he hands the bowl of baked beans to his mother, Samar, who distributes the food to the other children. She is gaunt and barely eats herself.\n\"I have cancer in my bones,\" she reveals. \"I am 31-years-old but when you see me you think I'm 60. I can't walk.\n\"If I walk, I get very tired. All my body hurts and I need treatment and nutrition.\"\nLike so many others, Samar and her family came to Rafah from their home further north in Khan Younis because the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told them it would be safe. That was three months ago.\nSince then, the war has come steadily closer to Rafah. More than 70 people were killed less than a fortnight ago when Israel launched a raid to rescue two hostages being held by Hamas.\nThe Zo'rab family's shelter leaks and the floor fills with rain. Sometimes, baby Howaida has no fresh diapers.\nEach day offers relentless indignities in a place where 1.5 million people - five times the normal population - are crammed next to the Egyptian border.\nWith 85% of Gaza's population now displaced, the amount of aid getting into the enclave is nowhere near what is needed.\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), five hundred trucks of aid per day are required. The daily average has been ninety.\nThe situation in northern Gaza is particularly acute.\nIsrael says the UN is failing to distribute aid in the north and that aid supplies are backed up - waiting to be collected on the Gaza side of the border.\nThe organisation has suspended movement of food aid in northern Gaza because it says there is no protection for truck drivers, who have faced attack by criminal gangs and looting by desperate people.\nOne truck was hit by shellfire, which the UN says came from an Israeli naval craft.\nIn addition, the Hamas-run police force in Gaza is no longer willing to escort food trucks because they fear being shot by the IDF.\n'Give us back our people'\nIn Israel, the military conduct of the war is still supported by a large majority.\nThere is no discernible body of opinion that supports stepping up the aid effort for civilians in Gaza. In one recent poll, 68% of Jewish respondents said they opposed the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza while Hamas still held Israeli hostages.\nBy contrast Arab Israelis polled were 85% in favour of aid.\nZvika Mor, whose eldest son, Eitan, is a hostage in Gaza, speaks of a boy who was the \"first person to call me Daddy\" and of how much he, his wife and their other seven children miss the young man kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October.\nEitan was acting as an unarmed security guard at the Nova music festival, where Hamas killed an estimated 360 people in and around the area.\nMr Mor heads a small group of hostage families that want their loved ones returned before any negotiations with Hamas.

    "The family of a seriously ill two-year-old boy said they have three months to save his life.\nRobertas and his wife, Egle, both 33, live in Peterborough, with their son, Adamas, who, in 2022 was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare, aggressive and complex cancer.\nAdamas has faced chemotherapy and had a kidney removed.\nThe family said their only hope now is a \u00c2\u00a3300,000 clinical trial in Italy.\nNeuroblastoma is most common in children under five. It is treatable on the NHS, but survival rates when relapses occur are poor.\nSome families turn to fundraising to pay for clinical trials in a bid to stop the cancer returning and face medical bills that dwarf the average UK house price.\nEgle said: \"It began in July 2022, when 14-month old Adamas was diagnosed with neuroblastoma. He faced the ordeal of chemotherapy, followed in November 2022 by a gruelling 11-hour operation to remove his left kidney which was wrapped by a sizeable tumour.\n\"Unfortunately, post-op routine scans showed that another tumour was growing back from the cancer cells that had been left around his main blood vessels during the surgery. So he started 2023 with high doses of chemotherapy, steam cells transplant, 12 cycles of radiotherapy, and immunotherapy.\"\nShe added: \"A routine scan in February 2024 showed a new 3cm growth, which again needed surgery for removal. After all the tests, we found out that there is a cancer cell modification called NYCM which can't be beaten by any more treatments that hospital have to offer.\n\"I thought it was the end of the world, I screamed and cried, it was the worst feeling knowing he had been through so much already. He is such an inspiration for everyone, he loves playing football and basketball and remains so happy.\n\"The only hope is to get Adamas on a clinical trial that takes place in Rome called CAR-T but it's not funded by the NHS and has to be paid by parents.\n\"The trials cost at least \u00c2\u00a3300,000 which is just a crazy amount of money for any of us, but it is crucial and could help to save Adamas' life. We have turned to fundraising on social media, and have \u00c2\u00a370,000 already\".\nA diagnosis kicks off a chain of NHS treatments - but families face challenging odds even if the cancer goes into remission. According to charity Solving Kids' Cancer, it returns in almost 50% of cases.\nIf it does come back, they say, fewer than one in 10 will survive.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by a woman who accused Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler of sexually assaulting her twice in 1975 when she was 17.\nUS District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Jeanne Bellino waited too long to sue the 75-year-old rock star, according to the Reuters news agency.\nMs Bellino, a former model, claimed he had groped her in a Manhattan phone booth before pinning her against a wall later that day and simulating sex.\nHe \"vehemently\" denied the allegations.\nThe judge decided the case did not qualify for a two-year window for submitting claims that would otherwise fall outside the usual legal time limit, because Tyler's alleged conduct did not meet the criteria for posing a \"serious risk of physical injury\".\nTyler's lawyer David Long-Daniels told Reuters: \"We agree with the judge's reasoning, and are grateful for this result on behalf of our client.\"\nThe singer has also denied claims in a separate continuing case filed by another woman in 2022.",
    "South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC) has launched its manifesto for the May elections, in which some polls suggest its share of the vote could fall below 50% for the first time.\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa addressed thousands of supporters at a rally in KwaZulu-Natal province.\nThe area will be a key battleground.\nDissatisfaction with the state of the economy, public services and corruption has eaten away at ANC support.\nThe party of Nelson Mandela, who led the struggle against the racist apartheid system and oversaw the transition to democracy in 1994, has been the dominant force for the last 30 years.\nBut stubbornly high unemployment, which now stands at more than 32%, frequent power cuts and high crime levels, among other issues, have led some to turn away from the ANC.\nThere are challenges coming from the right, in the form of the main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), and the more radical left with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).\nKwaZulu-Natal is also the home of former President Jacob Zuma, disenchanted with the party and now suspended from the ANC. He has thrown his weight behind a new formation - uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) - which has already made some small inroads at byelections in the province.\nSpeaking at a stadium in the city of Durban, with the crowd decked out in the ANC's black, green and gold, President Ramaphosa promised that \"we will do better\".\nIt was an acknowledgement that there are problems, but he also emphasised the transformation that the country has made in the last three decades.\n\"South Africans are more educated, empowered and healthier than they were under apartheid,\" he said, urging people not to threaten that progress.\nLooking forward, his party promises to create 2.5 million \"work opportunities\". It also pledges to boost investment and support the private sector as well as \"eradicate corruption\".\nIn his introduction to the manifesto, the president also wrote that \"there are forces that seek to use this election to undo the progress of democracy. It is crucial that together we defend our hard-won freedom.\"\nHe did not name those \"forces\" but the ANC knows it faces its toughest electoral environment yet.\nSince 1994, it has polled consistently above 50% in national elections, enabling it to run the country without challenge. But with some opinion polls showing that that support has dipped below an absolute majority, South Africa is facing the possibility of a coalition government after the 29 May general election.\nIn its party manifesto launched last week, the DA, under the leadership of John Steenhuisen, had a simple message: \"Our country is in crisis.\"\nIt has promised to create two million new jobs, end the power cuts and halve violent crime. The DA wants a more liberal economic approach, including introducing privatisation, especially in the energy sector.\nOn the opposite end of the political spectrum, the EFF's diagnosis is that the ANC has failed to dismantle the economic system that existed under apartheid.\nInstead, the governing party has \"reproduced and worsened apartheid economic inequalities\", the EFF's high-profile leader Julius Malema wrote in his introduction to its manifesto.\nThe EFF's answer is to expropriate land without compensation and nationalise the \"mines, banks and other strategic sectors of the economy, without compensation\".\nThat wealth would then be used to benefit the majority of the population.\nThe MK has not yet released its manifesto, but at the party's launch last December Mr Zuma said the ANC had moved away from its roots and it was now his mission to \"rescue\" the \"once-great movement\".\nThere are more than 300 parties registered with the electoral commission, and though not all will necessarily take part in the May vote the stage is set for three months of hard campaigning.",

The first thing that the GP did was to give me medication and then we spoke about counselling.\"\nDr Judith O'Neill, chair of the Perinatal Group at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Northern Ireland, said perinatal health services had a \"think family\" approach.\n\"We do check in with dads and partners and the wellbeing of the entire family,\" she added.\n\"I think it's very important - particularly in a postnatal period that parental mental health is as good as possible because we know that this will affect outcomes for the infant and children.\"\nWhat is postnatal depression?\nAccording to the NHS, postnatal depression is a type of depression that many parents experience after having a baby.\nSigns include a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood. Some people experience difficulty looking after themselves or their babies.\nIt affects more than one in 10 women within a year of giving birth and the NHS said it can also affect partners.\nPostnatal depression in men is not a term that is officially used in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, the Department of Health told BBC News NI it recognised that the postnatal period could be a time of considerable psychological and social stress for fathers and in some instances, this could contribute to the development of depression or depressive symptoms.\nDr Frances O'Hagan, deputy chair of the Northern Ireland General Practitioners Committee said men were more prone to depression after the arrival of a new baby.\n\"I personally don't feel the name is important - it's the condition that is important,\" she said.\n\"And the most important thing is that men get help. They put their hand up and say I'm suffering and I need help - and the help is there.\n\"It's very much an under-recognised condition. A lot of people tend to focus on the mother and not the father - but the father has an equal ability to become depressed.\"\nDepression diagnosis\nNeil Dickson, a father-of-two from Ballymena, also attends Dad's Voice.\nHe said after the birth of a child, the focus was rightfully on the mother's wellbeing, but his message is for partners to speak up if they are struggling.\n\"When my first child was born I probably did have depression but I wasn't quite aware of it,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"It was during the pregnancy of the second child that I knew something wasn't quite right. I talked it through with the health visitors and they recommended talking to the GP.\n\"In March last year, I was diagnosed with depression by the GP - about a month after we had our second child.\n\"At the time, I just thought parenting was incredibly tough and I wasn't doing a very good job.\n\"But it turns out through recent counselling that potentially I've been depressed for years.\n\"In terms of symptoms, I felt nothing. The stuff I usually would have enjoyed, I just did not care about.

    "In the last few days, Google's artificial intelligence (AI) tool Gemini has had what is best described as an absolute kicking online.\nGemini has been thrown onto a rather large bonfire: the culture war which rages between left- and right- leaning communities.\nGemini is essentially Google's version of the viral chatbot ChatGPT. It can answer questions in text form, and it can also generate pictures in response to text prompts.\nInitially, a viral post showed this recently launched AI image generator create an image of the US Founding Fathers which inaccurately included a black man.\nGemini also generated German soldiers from World War Two, incorrectly featuring a black man and Asian woman.\nGoogle apologised, and immediately \"paused\" the tool, writing in a blog post that it was \"missing the mark\".\nBut it didn't end there - its over-politically correct responses kept on coming, this time from the text version.\nGemini replied that there was \"no right or wrong answer\" to a question about whether Elon Musk posting memes on X was worse than Hitler killing millions of people.\nWhen asked if it would be OK to misgender the high-profile trans woman Caitlin Jenner if it was the only way to avoid nuclear apocalypse, it replied that this would \"never\" be acceptable.\nJenner herself responded and said actually, yes, she would be alright about it in these circumstances.\nElon Musk, posting on his own platform, X, described Gemini's responses as \"extremely alarming\" given that the tool would be embedded into Google's other products, collectively used by billions of people.\nI asked Google whether it intended to pause Gemini altogether. After a very long silence, I was told the firm had no comment. I suspect it's not a fun time to be working in the public relations department.\nBut in an internal memo Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai has acknowledged some of Gemini's responses \"have offended our users and shown bias\".\nThat was he said \"completely unacceptable\" - adding his teams were \"working around the clock\" to fix the problem.\nBiased data\nIt appears that in trying to solve one problem - bias - the tech giant has created another: output which tries so hard to be politically correct that it ends up being absurd.\nThe explanation for why this has happened lies in the enormous amounts of data AI tools are trained on.\nMuch of it is publicly available - on the internet, which we know contains all sorts of biases.\nTraditionally images of doctors, for example, are more likely to feature men. Images of cleaners on the other hand are more likely to be women.\nAI tools trained with this data have made embarrassing mistakes in the past, such as concluding that only men had high powered jobs, or not recognising black faces as human.\nIt is also no secret that historical storytelling has tended to feature, and come from, men, omitting women's roles from stories about the past.\nIt looks like Google has actively tried to offset all this messy human bias with instructions for Gemini not make those assumptions.\nBut it has backfired precisely because human history and culture are not that simple: there are nuances which we know instinctively and machines do not.\nUnless you specifically programme an AI tool to know that, for example, Nazis and founding fathers weren't black, it won't make that distinction.\nOn Monday, the co-founder of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis, an AI firm acquired by Google, said fixing the image generator would take a matter of weeks.\nBut other AI experts aren't so sure.\n\"There really is no easy fix, because there's no single answer to what the outputs should be,\" said Dr Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at Huggingface.\n\"People in the AI ethics community have been working on possible ways to address this for years.\"\nOne solution, she added, could include asking users for their input, such as \"how diverse would you like your image to be?\" but that in itself clearly comes with its own red flags.\n\"It's a bit presumptuous of Google to say they will 'fix' the issue in a few weeks. But they will have to do something,\" she said.\nProfessor Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at Surrey University, said it sounded like the problem was likely to be \"quite deeply embedded\" both in the training data and overlying algorithms - and that would be difficult to unpick.\n\"What you're witnessing... is why there will still need to be a human in the loop for any system where the output is relied upon as ground truth,\" he said.\nBard behaviour\nFrom the moment Google launched Gemin i, which was then known as Bard, it has been extremely nervous about it.

    "Car insurance quotes were a third more expensive in some areas of England with the biggest minority ethnicity populations, BBC Verify has found.\nWe collected thousands of quotes based on identical driver information, but with different addresses.\nAreas with a high number of people from ethnic minorities saw higher prices, even when road accident and crime levels were similar.\nThe insurance industry body said ethnicity was not a factor in pricing.\nBut Citizens Advice said the findings added to evidence of an \"ethnicity penalty\".\nAddress effect\nWhen you apply for car insurance, the price takes into account factors including your address, age and driving history.\nBut it is not known exactly how that calculation works, because insurance firms do not make the information publicly available.\nTo shed some light on this process, we tested the effect of changing a driver's address on the cost of insurance.\nWe chose 6,000 addresses from a spread of more and less wealthy and diverse areas, selecting 20 in the most deprived and 20 in the least deprived for each English local authority.\nAll other details like the driver's age, job, driving history and car model were kept the same.\nCrime and road accident levels, both of which are known to affect insurance premiums, were also taken into account.\nThe ethnicity penalty\nOn average, car insurance quotes were 33% higher in the most ethnically diverse parts of England, compared with the least diverse.\nFor example, the quotes - for a 30-year-old teacher driving a Ford Fiesta - averaged at \u00c2\u00a31,975 if they lived in the Princes End area of Sandwell, near Birmingham. But in the nearby Great Bridge area, the average was \u00c2\u00a32,796.\nThe two areas have similar scores for road accidents and crime, according to a government measure called the Index of Multiple Deprivation, but Great Bridge has a larger black, Asian and minority ethnic population.\nCalls for transparency\nA spokesperson from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said: \"Insurers do not and cannot use ethnicity as a factor when setting prices and our members comply with the Equality Act 2010.\n\"However, we recognise that these and other similar findings raise an important public policy debate.\"\nConcerns have been raised before around insurance companies' algorithms leading to people from ethnic minorities facing higher premiums.\nIn 2019, industry regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found several companies could not provide details of what factors were taken into account, or how they ensured they did not breach the Equality Act 2010.\nAnd a 2023 Citizens Advice survey of 15,000 people found that people from ethnic minorities were charged 40% on average more than white people.\nDavid Mendes da Costa, principal policy manager at Citizens Advice, said the FCA needed to \"get off the sidelines and investigate why people of colour are being charged so much more\".\n\"And if insurers can't explain, the FCA must move fast to end this practice for good.\"\nAn FCA spokesperson said it was looking into the concerns.\n\"We recently asked the largest motor insurers to show us how they ensure their pricing models do not discriminate based on ethnicity, and we are reviewing their responses.\n\"The law is clear that insurers must not discriminate based on certain characteristics, like race and ethnicity.\n\"They need to be sure, and be able to reassure us, they are not doing so. Our rules also mean insurers should only sell products that provide fair value to their customers.\"\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "Councillors in Lincolnshire have voted to raise council tax in the area by almost 5%.\nThe Conservative-led authority backed a 4.99% increase at a meeting on Friday.

    "The SNP's Westminster leader has accused the Speaker of \"effectively lying\" over the possibility of an emergency Gaza debate.\nLast week an SNP debate on Gaza descended into chaos after a decision over voting by Sir Lindsay Hoyle.\nHe apologised and offered the possibility of a second debate this week - before rejecting that bid .\nThe Speaker's Office explained the decision was due to a ministerial statement on the same issue.\nMr Flynn told BBC Radio Scotland: \"Unfortunately, the Speaker of the House of Commons (has) broken the rules and now broke his word and effectively lied, not just to SNP MPs but the entire parliamentary chamber and indeed the public last Thursday.\n\"I don't think anyone can be in any position where they don't find that deeply, deeply challenging, given the Speaker of the House of Commons is there to effectively ensure that democracy runs smoothly on these isles.\"\n'Emergency debate should not proceed'\nA spokesperson from Speaker's Office referred to Sir Lindsay's statement in the Commons on Monday, when he explained his reasoning.\nHe said: \"In determining whether a matter is urgent, I must have regard to the probability of the matter being brought before the House in time by other means. The House came to a resolution on this matter on Wednesday last week.\n\"Further, I understand that the government are ready to make a relevant statement tomorrow, so there is a very imminent opportunity for this important matter to come before the House.\n\"That is why I decided that the application for an emergency debate should not proceed.\"\nThe furore started last week, when the Speaker decided to allow a Labour amendment to an SNP motion on Gaza to go to a vote, effectively denying the SNP the chance to vote on their own motion.\nSir Lindsay apologised the same day, insisting his priority was the safety of MPs, which he believes to be under threat over this issue.\nBut anger in the ranks of SNP and Conservative MPs saw them band together to sign an Early Day Motion of no confidence in the Speaker. It now stands at 81 signatures.\nUnder mounting pressure to quit, Sir Lindsay offered the SNP the option of an emergency debate, known as an SO24, alongside another apology.\nHowever, he later turned down the SNP's request for that emergency debate, now saying a statement from the government on Tuesday would be sufficient.\nAn update on Israel and Gaza is being made to MPs by Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell, who said calling for a ceasefire would not be enough to make one happen and re-stated the government's position.\n\"We are trying to negotiate an immediate pause in order that we can get the hostages out and get incredibly badly-needed aid in, leading to a sustainable ceasefire,\" he said.\nShadow Foreign Office minister David Lammy called for an \"immediate humanitarian ceasefire now\", which he said should be a \"truce in exchange for hostages... by Ramadan\".\nSNP foreign affairs spokesperson Brendan O'Hara accused Israel of \"ethnic cleansing and collective punishment\" and the UK government of \"complete dereliction of all moral and legal responsibility\".\nIn response, Mr Mitchell rejected the claims and said \"the central aim of all us is to bring about a ceasefire\" and that, \"beneath the sound and fury\" of Mr O'Hara's statement \"there is more substantial agreement between his party and the government than he is recognising\".",
    "When Tadcaster Bridge collapsed during the devastating floods of December 2015 the town was cut in two. Fast forward nine years and residents are still at the mercy of the weather, with rising river levels prompting frequent closures.\nDespite a recent change to the height the water must hit before the crossing is shut, those living in the town told the BBC the fear of being divided remains.\n\"It's a worrying thing this bridge,\" says Ruth Pearson.\nThe 101-year-old lives on the eastern side of the River Wharfe, her family live on the opposite bank.\n\"That bridge, you close it and you're separating a whole village of people. It's ridiculous.\"\nHer daughters, Ruby Jones and Elizabeth Pearce, regularly visit their mum, using the18th Century bridge to make the short journey across the river.\nBut in 2023, the 300-year-old crossing was closed five times in the space of three months, turning the brief walk into a 16-mile round trip by car.\n\"It's awful, because you do feel helpless. There's nothing we can do in a hurry,\" says Elizabeth.\nSince it reopened in 2017, after a \u00c2\u00a34.4m restoration project, the bridge has had to close during bad weather due to safety concerns.\nUntil recently North Yorkshire Council would shut the bridge when the river hit approximately 2.42m (7ft 9in) but now, following an engineering inspection, the bridge can stay open until levels reach 2.8m (9ft 1in).\n\"You don't realise how much you rely on that connection\", says Tadcaster councillor Kirsty Poskitt.\n\"It's not just a bridge to us, it's our lifeline in the town.\n\"Tadcaster's a really linear town so there's no other way around.\nWhen the bridge is closed it causes \"panic\" for Ruby, who puts plans in place to check on her mum.\n\"I panic immediately because I know she's going to worry,\" she says.\n\"I would never have moved over to the side of Tad while she's alive if that had become an issue a year ago. It would have been like moving to another town altogether.\"\nWhile Ruby's concerns remain, the council hope the recent change will mean the fewer closures in the future.\nSpeaking earlier this month council leader Carl Les said he hoped the change would come as \"welcome news\", adding that closures were only put in place \"when absolutely necessary\".\nReflecting on the changes to life in Tadcaster, Kirsty said the town would just have to get used to \"a new normal\".\n\"I know that's not necessarily what people want to hear but the world is changing and things that are impacting globally are impacting us here, so we do just have to get used to what will be normal for us.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has joined criticism of Welsh government proposals for changes to farm subsidies.\nDescribing them as \"damaging\" and \"shocking\", he accused Welsh Labour of risking UK food supply security.\nProposals under consultation for farmers to be given cash for having trees on 10% of their land have sparked protests.\nWelsh ministers said the new scheme is designed to support all farmers.\nMr Sunak, who met with farmers on Thursday, was presented with a letter which called on the UK government to intervene and potentially withhold funding for the Welsh government's agricultural budget.\nThe two men vying to be the next first minister of Wales - Vaughan Gething and Jeremy Miles - have both promised to listen to farmers' concerns.\nIn recently days outgoing First Minister Mark Drakeford was followed into a college in Rhyl, while a go-slow protest was held in Newtown at the weekend.\nSpeaking to BBC Wales ahead of the Welsh Conservatives' party conference in Llandudno, Mr Sunak said farming unions were \"rightly concerned about Labour's policies here in Wales\".\nHe said Labour's plans \"by their own assessment would cost 1000s of jobs, reduce our food security and damage farm income, and that's why those plans have rightly been described as damaging and shocking\".\nAfter the UK left the European Union it has had to draw up its own schemes to support agriculture.\nFarming subsidies are controlled in Wales in Cardiff, while the UK government manages them in England.\nA new post-Brexit farm payments scheme in England has been criticised for focusing on environmental policy over food productivity.\nAt a conference earlier this week Mr Sunak promised a package of measures to help farmers which were broadly welcomed by the National Farmers Union, although it said no actual new money was included.\nMr Sunak told the BBC: \"We announced more funding to back British farmers to produce more food, because I think that's the right plan.\"\nHe added: \"We've committed to deliver every penny of the funding that we had previously [from the EU], \u00c2\u00a32.4bn across the United Kingdom.\n\"We have held to that commitment but how that's been used in Wales is incredibly damaging for Welsh farmers.\"\nThe letter given to Mr Sunak said the group of farmers \"very much hoped\" the UK government would make the Welsh government's funding dependent on a more \"realistic and sustainable plan for the future of agriculture and food production in Wales\".\nThe campaigners described the Welsh government as \"unreasonable\" and said its stance posed a \"profound risk to farmers' livelihoods\".\nMr Sunak was asked about reports that the UK government was buying the Wylfa site from its previous developer, but said it wouldn't be \"right for me to comment on any conversations that may or may not be taking place\".\nLast year the UK government promised to fund the electrification of North Wales mainline.\nAsked for a timescale, he said: \"These rail lines do take time.\n\"But the key thing is the money has now been put aside to deliver it.\"\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"In Wales, we have maintained the Basic Payment Scheme at \u00c2\u00a3238m in 2024, which was not easy in the financial circumstances. It is something farmers asked us to do in order to provide stability and we listened.\n\"The UK government has not maintained BPS at the same levels in England and, unlike what the UK government has done in England, we are not proposing to bring forward fragmented schemes. We have developed the Sustainable Farming Scheme, in partnership with the sector, in a way which is designed to support all farmers in Wales through a Universal Baseline Payment.\n\"It must also be remembered we continue to feel the impact of decisions taken by the UK government which means we have lost \u00c2\u00a3243m in replacement EU funding.\n\"The Welsh government is committed to supporting the agriculture sector in Wales and we have been very clear working in partnership with the farming sector is key.

I work for the Royal Mail and the entire money he took was all of my wages for all of Covid.\n\"When he left us without a kitchen, we didn't even have a kitchen sink.

    "More than 50 journalists have sent an open letter calling on Israel and Egypt to provide \"free and unfettered access to Gaza for all foreign media\".\nThe letter is signed by correspondents and presenters for broadcasters with UK bases, including the BBC's Jeremy Bowen, Lyse Doucet and Mishal Husain.\nIt says the need for comprehensive on-the-ground reporting is \"imperative\".\nIsrael's military says its troops have taken journalists on escorted trips in Gaza to allow them to report safely.\nPalestinian journalists and media workers have reported from inside Gaza since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October, but dozens have been killed, injured or gone missing.\nIn the letter , the 55 journalists write that \"foreign reporters are still being denied access to the territory, outside of the rare and escorted trips with the Israeli military\".\nThe escorted trips are highly controlled and often only to show tunnels that the military says are used by Hamas or weapons stores.\nOnly one foreign journalist has been granted entry into Gaza through Egypt on an escorted visit. CNN's Clarissa Ward - who is among the signatories of the letter - was able to spend only a few hours on the ground in the southern border city of Rafah with an Emirati medical team in December.\nThe letter calls on Israel's government to \"openly state its permission for international journalists to operate in Gaza\".\nIt also asks Egyptian authorities to allow foreign press access to the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza.\nThe letter continues: \"It's vital that local journalists' safety is respected and that their efforts are bolstered by the journalism of members of the international media. The need for comprehensive on-the-ground reporting of the conflict is imperative.\n\"The risks of conflict reporting are well understood by our organisations who have decades of experience of reporting in warzones around the world and in previous wars in Gaza.\"\nThe broadcasters represented in the letter are the UK's BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky News, and the US outlets ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC.\nA number of journalists who signed the letter have been reporting from Israel during the conflict.\nIn November, the BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen travelled with Israeli forces into Gaza . While the BBC had editorial control of the report, the section with the Israeli forces was viewed by them.\nWhen asked for comment on the letter, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said: \"The IDF is currently conducting a war against the terror organisation Hamas.\n\"In order to allow journalists to report safely, the IDF accompanies them when in the battlefield.\"\nLast month, the Foreign Press Association (FPA) in Jerusalem accused Israel of imposing an unprecedented ban on independent foreign press access to Gaza , after the Israeli High Court of Justice rejected a petition from the organisation and ruled that restrictions on entry were justified on security grounds.\nThe FPA said defence authorities had told the court that journalists in Gaza could be put at risk in wartime and endanger soldiers by reporting on troop positions. They also argued that it was too dangerous for Israeli personnel to be present at the Israeli border to facilitate press entry to Gaza.\nThe court's ruling also cited defence authorities as stating that the Rafah crossing was \"under the control and sovereignty\" of Egypt, and that \"to the best of [their] knowledge\" the Egyptian government was allowing foreign journalists to enter Gaza. However, in late October a senior Egyptian official said it was the Israeli military stopping journalists from entering.\nAlmost 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza during the war between Israel and Hamas, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says.\nIsrael's military launched an air and ground campaign after Hamas's attacks on Israel on 7 October, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage.\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) , at least 83 Palestinian and two Israeli journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the war.",

    "A surgeon sacked by a hospital after raising safety concerns has accused the trust of a cover-up after a patient was partially blinded during an operation.\nJuanita Graham, 41, lost the sight in her left eye during an operation at Bath's Royal United Hospital (RUH) in 2019. She is now suing the trust.\nSerryth Colbert said he was put down as the lead author on an investigation into the incident, but said he \"did not write a word\" of it.\nThe RUH has declined to comment.\nMr Colbert has described the hospital investigation into Mrs Graham's operation as \"deeply flawed\".\nThe surgeon, who specialises in the head, neck, face and jaw, has made several serious allegations about patient safety at the RUH, and believes these claims led to him being regarded as a troublemaker and dismissed in October 2023.\nMrs Graham, from Trowbridge, said she was still traumatised by the operation on her eye.\n\"I remember coming round, seeing the time and felt like a gush and I couldn't see,\" she said.\n\"The next time I remember waking up again, I thought it was my partner but it was a surgeon and he was crying. I said 'what's gone wrong?'.\n\"What was meant to be a simple operation has now left me with scarring and permanent damage to my optic nerve and I won't be able to see again.\"\nMrs Graham was sedated for another operation to find out what had happened, but said that when she woke up there was an immediate sense something was not right.\n\"I remember waking up and one of the nurses whispered in my ear when I came out,\" she said.\n\"She said to me 'you are going to get through this and get big compensation'.\n\"Even the students seemed nervous. Everything in my notes was messed up, and every time I asked a question no-one seemed to know [what happened].\"\nAfter the operation, a Root Cause Analyses (RCA) report produced by the trust said the hospital was not to blame, although it did say the risks could have been explained more clearly to Mrs Graham.\nMr Colbert, whose name was added as the lead investigator, said his only involvement in the report was when he was called on the phone by a nurse, who he said did the RCA, to explain what the operation involved.\nThe 48-year-old surgeon said: \"I have been put down here to my amazement as the lead author on this.\n\"That is not correct. I did not write a word of this.\n\"The conclusion is the root cause of the complication was down to a bit of paperwork which could have been performed a bit better.\n\"The root cause was not down to paperwork. It was all covered up... that was indefensible.\"\nThe RUH has declined to comment on Mr Colbert's accusations of a cover-up, although it has recently told Mrs Graham that it will reopen her complaint.\nMr Colbert, as well as a number of other surgeons the BBC has spoken to, believes Mrs Graham's procedure was not done properly.\nMrs Graham said: \"It's changed my life completely, from my balancing, walking into doors, not judging space.\n\"I still have pain to this day, even to move the eye. The eye is not closing... and I get a lot of infections. My life has now changed.\"\nMrs Graham was taken by the BBC to meet Mr Colbert, who explained his concerns about the surgery to her.\nShe said: \"I know now the truth and hopefully I can do something about it because it's wrong.\n\"I just wanted it fixed but now I have heard this, it's changed everything.\"\nShe has also approached the Royal College of Surgeons which has been asked by the trust to look into safety concerns raised by Mr Colbert as she wants her case looked at in detail.\nMr Colbert believes it was raising concerns like this one about Mrs Graham's surgery that led to him being investigated by the RUH trust.\nHe said that after a long suspension, he was sacked last year for allegedly bullying staff.\nThe trust had previously said it has \"never dismissed anybody for raising concerns and never will\".\nIt added that Mr Colbert's dismissal related to \"significant concerns about bullying\" and its investigation into his conduct was \"thorough\" and \"robust\".\nHe is suing the trust for loss of earnings.\nIn a statement, the Royal United Hospital said concerns about bullying and intimidation by Mr Colbert were \"raised by a number of staff and thoroughly investigated by an independent expert as part of a robust disciplinary process.\"\nIt said it supports anyone \"to raise concerns so they can be investigated and dealt with fairly\".\nFollow BBC West on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Struggling parents are too scared to ask for help getting baby milk, a charity has warned.\nThe Chester-based KidsBank charity said families are fearful they may \"lose their children\" if they admit they cannot afford to feed them.\nSome parents had even resorted to watering formula down to make it last longer, it claimed.\nThe charity has now introduced a scheme whereby parents can access free formula without having to go to their GP.\nIn July 2023, Kidsbank took part in an initial scheme whereby parents had to approach a professional such as a GP, health visitor or teacher to request a referral to get free baby milk.\nBut only 20 families accessed it during the six months it was in operation, and no families came back for a repeat referral, the charity said.\n'Huge fear factor'\nThis sparked alarm bells, and when the charity asked parents about the scheme, they said they were consistently told that it was a \"fear factor\" that was stopping people asking for help.\nDee Denton, KidsBank operations manager, said: \"What we found was that there was a huge huge fear factor in families approaching a professional because their fear was that in doing so, for formula, would be to highlight that they were struggling to feed their baby and therefore that would lead to, ultimately, them losing their children through a referral to social services,\" she added.\n\"That was something that weighed heavily on us, as a charity.\"\nSince this new initiative has been introduced, the charity, which covers Cheshire and Flintshire, North Wales, said it had already seen a marked rise in demand, including repeat referrals.\nMs Denton added: \"We were receiving feedback that families were faced with no other option but to take measures such as watering down formula, putting baby rice into the milk or, in many examples, weaning their child early because the cost of providing food was less than providing for a tin of formula.\"\nKidsBank, which relies on donations of infant milk formula for the scheme, is also able to supply vouchers downloadable to phones to enable parents to purchase infant milk from shops.\nTh self-referral scheme comes as concerns have been raised about the cost of baby milk, with the UK infant formula market under investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\nThe price of formula has risen by 25% over two years, according to an initial report published in November, with an average tin now costing \u00c2\u00a317.50.\nThe CMA said that prices had fallen a little but remained \"at historically high levels\".\nIf you're affected by the issues in this piece, you can find support from BBC Action Line .\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "A producer of the 2014 TV show Benefits Street has said he regrets tarring the reputation of the road it focussed on.\nThe documentary series, which followed the lives of people in Birmingham's James Turner Street, has been branded one of the most controversial ever.\nWhen it aired it generated hundreds of complaints and sparked nationwide debate about the welfare system.\nTen years on, Love Productions' Kieran Smith said the road's name could have been withheld in hindsight.\n\"When we set out to make the programme we didn't forecast that it was going to be the thing it became,\" said Kieran Smith, executive producer of the programme.\n\"I do have sympathy with people who say 'listen that's tarred our street' or 'we've got a reputation we didn't ask for'. I do regret that.\u00c2\n\"But it wasn't our motive to do that.\n\"Our expectation was this would be a series that would fly under the radar. It turned into something much larger.\"\nResidents have told the BBC that even now they are reluctant to reveal their address because of James Turner Street's association with the documentary.\nIn many ways, circumstances there are similar to that of a decade ago. The number of people receiving benefits in the wider area is almost identical - 371 in February 2014 compared with 367 in August 2023.\nBut Mr Smith, now creative director of Love Productions, said in other respects the situation - in light of the cost of living crisis - is now \"probably a lot worse than it was in 2014\".\nResidents have particularly hit out at the state of the area.\nOne woman in her 80s, who has lived on the\u00c2\u00a0street\u00c2\u00a0for more than 10 years, said: \"You would think that, with the programme, there would be some assistance to the homeowners or generally to try and improve the area.\n\"But instead it's got worse.

    "Conservatives in both the US and UK need a \"bigger bazooka\" to fight the left, former Prime Minister Liz Truss has told an event in Maryland.\n\"Unless conservatives become more active in speaking out... Western civilisation is doomed,\" Ms Truss said.\nShe was speaking at the biggest annual gathering of conservatives in the US.\nThe UK's shortest-serving PM - who was in Downing Street for six weeks - also sought to peg her downfall to \"antagonism\" from the establishment.\nBoth Labour and the Liberal Democrats accused Ms Truss of spreading \"conspiracy theories\".\nThe former prime minister was speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), hosted by the American Conservative Union, which runs until Saturday.\nThe grassroots gathering is one of the leading events on the conservative political calendar, and has been transformed in recent years into a heavily pro-Donald Trump affair, a reflection of his takeover of the Republican Party.\nOther speakers this week include Nigel Farage, the presidents of El Salvador and Argentina, and Mr Trump himself on Saturday.\nDuring Ms Truss' 20-minute speech on Thursday afternoon - in between sessions that covered topics including transgender children, oil and gas and a speech from Lara Trump, Mr Trump's daughter-in-law - she sought to attack the establishment in the UK and US.\n\"We have to understand how deep the vested interests of the establishment are, how hard they will fight, and how unfairly they will fight in order to get their way,\" she said. \"And that is what I learnt from my time as a government minister and my time in No 10.\"\n\"The West has been run by the Left for too long and it's been a complete disaster,\" she said.\n\"In Britain we are one of the few countries that still have a conservative government.\"\nDespite that, she said conservatives had to \"challenge the system itself\", saying: \"It's not even enough to get the position of power that you need to deliver those policies because conservatives are now operating in a hostile environment... we essentially need a bigger bazooka in order to be able to deliver.\"\nAnd she accused people on the left of the politics of \"weaponising our court system\" and \"pushing their woke agenda through our schools\".\nShe said because of people on the left, the West has been seen as weak, which had helped what she called \"our enemies\", countries such as Russia, Iran and China.\n\"We've enabled Putin by not taking action early enough when he could be stopped,\" she said.\nDuring her 45 days in office Ms Truss was remembered for announcing a series of economic measures widely blamed for reducing the value of the pound and panicking financial markets.\nShe addressed her short tenure as prime minister during the speech, saying she had \"faced the most almighty backlash for those conservative policies I tried to put in place\".\nShe said: \"From the usual suspects in the corporate world, but also from people who were meant to work for the government. The OBR, the Bank of England.\n\"And even President Biden intervened to have a go at my policies. Can you imagine being attacked on your economic policies by the inventor of Bidenomics?\" she said to laughter.\nThe US president's vast package of subsidies and tax breaks for industry has been dubbed \"Bidenomics\".\nLabour's shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth described Ms Truss's comments as \"damaging nonsense\" about a \"deep state\".\n\"After crashing the economy and sending mortgages rocketing, Liz Truss is now spreading conspiracy theories with Steve Bannon and spearheading a wacky fringe group to take over the Tory Party again,\" he added.\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper also poured scorn on the speech, saying: \"This Conservative Party love-in for right-wing American politics is like watching a slow-moving car crash.\"\nShe called for Ms Truss to be stripped of the allowance she currently receives for being a former PM. The Public Duty Costs Allowance for all former prime ministers is currently set at \u00c2\u00a3115,000.\nMs Truss did not disclose whom she would be backing in the race to be the Republican candidate for this year's US election, but she said: \"Of course we need a Republican back in the White House. We need it desperately.\"\nMr Trump is currently the frontrunner in the race to pick the Republican Party's candidate for this year's presidential election, which takes place in November.\nThis weekend marks another stage in the race - with South Carolina the next state to pick its preferred Republican candidate.

And that's what the court must free itself from.\"\nThe charges against Br\u00c3\u00bcckner were read out for the first time in detail during Friday morning's proceedings.\nHe faces three rape allegations and two of the sexual abuse of children in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.\nThe charges he faces in full:\nHis defence team suggested it would challenge two of the rape charges based on the statute of limitations and because of insufficient evidence on when those alleged offences might have been committed.\nThey will deny Br\u00c3\u00bcckner's involvement in the rape in Praia de Rocha in 2004.\nThey told the court they regarded key witnesses as \"unreliable\" due to known drug or alcohol issues.\nThe lawyers said they would challenge one of the child sex abuse charges on the basis that children can be susceptible to \"suggestive questioning\".\nThe defence also applied to have items of evidence thrown out. It claimed that USB sticks found on land in Saxony-Anhalt in 2016 were illegally obtained.\nThe defence also said that the prosecution had failed to disclose important information about investigations into its client.\nIt claimed federal police had been involved in bugging Br\u00c3\u00bcckner's prison cell to try to catch him incriminating himself in the Madeline McCann investigation - meaning conversations with his lawyer may have been illicitly recorded.\nThey also said an undercover investigator had been sent into prison where Br\u00c3\u00bcckner was being held to try to provoke the suspect into talking about Madeline - something the defence claims was unsuccessful but should have been disclosed.\n\"At the core is the problem that the investigation into Maddie McCann cannot be separated from the investigation into these cases which are the subject of this trial,\" Mr F\u00c3\u00bclscher said outside court.\n\"The federal police have just one file but the prosecution selected only certain aspects for this trial. In our view that is not legally correct and we have right to access all files in this investigation.\"\nLast week, proceedings were abruptly suspended after Br\u00c3\u00bcckner's lawyers objected to the suitability of a lay judge.\nBr\u00c3\u00bcckner sat largely motionless through the proceedings.\nThe trial is expected to resume next Friday.\nThree-year-old Madeleine McCann vanished from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in Portugal's Algarve region, in 2007. It remains one of the highest-profile missing persons cases in the world.\nBr\u00c3\u00bcckner identified as a suspect by German investigators in June 2020, in what they have classed as a murder inquiry.

    "A dress containing the DNA of plague bacteria and a necklace made from porcelain teeth have gone on show as part of an exhibition in Leeds.\nThe raw silk \"plague dress\", made by artist Anna Dumitriu, is on display at the Thackray Museum of Medicine as part of its Fragile Microbiomes exhibition.\nIt is stuffed with lavender, which was used to cover the smell of plague victims, and dyed with walnut husks.\nThe collection includes sculptures and installations blending art and science.\nThe dress is made in the style of a garment from 1665, the year of the Great Plague.\nIt is hand-dyed with walnut husks in reference to herbalist Nicholas Culpeper, who recommended walnuts as a treatment for the disease.\nJamie Taylor, director of collections and programmes, said: \"We are very excited to host an exhibition from an artist as bold and innovative as Anna Dumitriu.\n\"Her work speaks to the past, present and future of medicine and microbiology - and the mix of traditional techniques and cutting-edge science is a great fit for Thackray's outlook.\"\nMs Dumitriu extracted the DNA from killed plague bacteria in the laboratory of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the UK Health Security Agency, where she is artist in residence.\nOther exhibits include further items made using a combination of bacteria and textiles - art which \"delves into the intricacies of the microbial world\", the museum said.\nThackray Museum of Medicine, opened in 1997, is set in a former workhouse that became part of Leeds' St James's Hospital.\nFragile Microbiomes runs until 23 June.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

    "British firms say they are facing higher shipping costs and delays of up to four weeks due to Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, a business group said.\nMore than a third of the firms surveyed by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said they had been affected.\nThat figure rose to more than half among exporters responding to the survey.\nThe added costs could contribute to higher prices in the UK economy generally, the BCC warned.\n\"There has been spare capacity in the shipping-freight industry to respond to the difficulties, which has bought us some time,\" William Bain, BCC head of trade policy, said.\nHowever, speaking to the BBC's Today programme he said: \"The pressures are getting higher and higher and there's only so long that costs can be absorbed... [The scale of price rises] is not as high as the pandemic - but these cannot be kept away from prices for long.\"\nExporters, retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers were more likely than other firms to be feeling the impact, the BCC found, leaving some short of goods to sell to customers and components for production lines, or facing cashflow difficulties.\nRerouting shipments around the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, was adding an extra three to four weeks to delivery times, the BCC said, with some firms citing price rises of more than 300% for container hire, it said.\nRachael Waring, managing director of Warings Furniture which imports interior decor for pubs and restaurants, said the conflict had been affecting her business since before Christmas.\n\"We have had to budget for extra costs, because the quotes we're getting for containers have been considerably higher,\" she told the BBC's Wake Up To Money.\nShe is also offering clients extra services to make up for delays. But she hopes to counteract some of the cost increases by negotiating lower prices with the Chinese manufacturers she sources from, and avoid further price rises for customers if she can.\nThe BCC, which represents more than 50,000 businesses across its network, said given the circumstances it would like to see extra government support for exporters, including the formation of an exports council to promote trade.\n\"The UK economy saw a drop in its total goods exports for 2023, and with global demand weak, there is a need for the government to look at providing support in the March Budget,\" Mr Bain said.\nHe said that small businesses like Rachael's would be finding things more difficult than larger companies, and suggested the government could help by reforming business rates, for example, to help them through \"these difficult times in trade\".\nShipping rates have increased after Houthis attacked commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea following the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict in October. The Iran-backed group said it was targeting ships linked to Israel, the US and the UK in support of Hamas.\nThe US and the UK have responded with air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.\nThe Red Sea is the fastest sea route between Asia and Europe. Large shipping firms, including Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, have diverted vessels to the much longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope and then up the west side of the continent. But that has pushed up costs, including for insurance, as well as creating delays.\nEarlier this month one of the UK's best known tea brands, Tetley, warned supplies were \"much tighter\" than it would like and rival Yorkshire Tea said it was also monitoring the situation closely.\nThe BCC heard from more than 1,000 firms in their annual survey, which took place between 15 January and 9 February.\nOf those responding 90% were small firms, with fewer than 250 employees.",

    "An Alabama court ruling that frozen embryos created through fertility treatment are children has delivered an election-year opportunity for Democrats - and a political headache for Republicans.\nUS President Joe Biden's party is already campaigning on the controversy, casting November's vote as a fight over reproductive rights.\nFor Republicans, the row could pose an obstacle in their carefully laid plans to win back suburban women and swing voters.\nAt least three fertility clinics in Alabama have paused in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) since last week's ruling.\nThe all-Republican justices decided that frozen embryos created through IVF are considered children under state law.\nWhile the ruling does not ban or restrict IVF, several medical providers in the state cited fears of legal repercussions as they paused fertility services in recent days.\nOn Thursday President Biden sought to blame the ruling on his predecessor and likely Republican challenger in this year's election, Donald Trump.\nMr Biden said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the Alabama decision was only possible because of the 2022 ruling by the US Supreme Court - which has three Trump appointees - to nullify abortion rights.\nWhile many conservatives celebrated the end of Roe v Wade, it proved a potent get-out-the-vote motivator for Democrats and a messaging nightmare for Republicans.\nMr Biden's party will be hoping the Deep South fallout over IVF will prove as energising for their electoral base as the abortion issue.\nDemocrats are already depicting the Alabama case as what they see as a portent of further assaults on women's rights if their rivals make headway in the coming general election.\nUS Vice-President Kamala Harris accused Republicans of hypocrisy during a stop on her \"Fight for Reproductive Freedoms\" tour in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Thursday.\n\"On the one hand, the proponents are saying that an individual doesn't have a right to end an unwanted pregnancy and, on the other hand, the individual does not have the right to start a family,\" she told an audience.\nForty-two percent of Americans have either used IVF treatments or known someone who did, according to a Pew Survey last year. That percentage rises with increased earnings - 45% among middle-income Americans and 59% for those with high-incomes.\nThose individuals are more likely to be white Americans who vote Republican, and many are ones whom Mr Trump is hoping to bring back into the political fold after losing their support in 2020.\nThe IVF controversy could well frustrate that effort.\nShana Gadarian, a political science professor at Syracuse University, said: \"In other words, restricting IVF is going to be unpopular even among conservative and Republican voters and is an extreme position not shared by most Americans.\"\nMr Trump has so far stayed silent on the subject. Other Republican office-holders have either avoided the issue altogether, or steered a middle ground, distancing themselves from the few hardline conservatives who do support restricting access to fertility treatment and contraception.\nNew Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, a moderate Republican, called the Alabama ruling \"scary\" while speaking at the Politico Governors Summit on Thursday.\nSenator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a potential Trump running mate, said he had not \"studied the issue\" when pressed by reporters on Thursday.\nNikki Haley, Mr Trump's last challenger for the Republican White House nomination, initially agreed in the wake of the Alabama court ruling that \"embryos are babies\".\nShe backtracked slightly on Thursday, telling CNN that embryos should be protected, but that Alabama \"needs to go back and look at the law\".\n\"We don't want fertility treatments to shut down. We don't want them to stop doing IVF treatments,\" said Ms Haley, who used fertility treatments to have her two children.\nEven anti-abortion groups seemed torn on Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, one of the largest annual gatherings of Republican voters.\nJessica Andreae, director of operations of the ProLove Ministries, told the BBC at the event near Washington DC that she agreed with the Alabama court that embryos should be considered human life, but added that it \"is a very complex issue for me\".\n\"I have a friend who has two dear children through fertility treatment,\" she said. \"And any human life, however it's brought into this world, is a gift.\"\nHow Republicans manage that balancing act could prove decisive as the presidential election looms.\nWith additional reporting from Francesca Gillett\nMore on the US election",
    "All of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon's first four children were taken into care, a court has been told.\nThe Old Bailey heard the children were removed when a judge found there had been an incident of domestic violence.\nThe jury was also told police were called when the couple went to a hospital to have their first child in 2017, where they gave false names.\nThey deny manslaughter charges over their fifth child, baby Victoria, whose body was found in a shed.\nIn agreed facts read to the jury, the London court heard that Ms Marten first went to a hospital in London in June 2017 where she told them she had been living in a camper van.\nSocial services issued a \"national hospital alert\" to other parts of the NHS, which is issued when it is suspected a pregnant woman needs protection or support.\nShe then attended a hospital in Wales with Mr Gordon that winter where she was in the early stages of labour and admitted as an \"unbooked case\" - where the mother has had no NHS antenatal care.\nShe said her name was Isabella O'Brien, while Mr Gordon said his name was James Amer. Speaking with a fake Irish accent, she told staff she was from a travelling family, had never been to school and did not have an NHS number.\nThe jury heard previously that Ms Marten was from a wealthy family and by December 2022 was receiving a monthly allowance of \u00c2\u00a33,400.\nWhen the couple's real identities were ascertained the police were called, as well as social services.\nShe said they had moved to Wales to get away from her family.\nIt emerged that the couple had been living in a tent in a wooded area and had only bought some clothes and nappies in preparation for the arrival of their first child.\nMs Marten accompanied a social worker to the tent, which was described as a \"festival\" style tent not suitable for cold weather. It was bowed under rainwater and smelled stale. There were a number of black bin bags containing clothing.\nThe social worker later said: \"I explained to her it was winter and the crowded space was wholly inappropriate for living.\"\nThe social worker also said Ms Marten told them she and Mr Gordon had an alternative lifestyle and asked them not to judge her.\nThe baby born in Wales in winter 2017, referred to in court as FF, was initially made the subject of an interim care order and Ms Marten lived with the baby in temporary mother and baby accommodation.\nOn two occasions social workers spoke to her about the risk of falling asleep with the baby on her chest.\nIt was explained that falling asleep with a baby on you poses significant risks due to the potential for suffocation, overheating and positional asphyxia. Their airways can easily become blocked when placed in certain positions, especially if they are sleeping on an adult's chest.\nAlso, the weight of an adult's body combined with the soft surface of a bed or couch can cause the baby's head to be positioned in a way that restricts their ability to breathe properly. This is known as positional asphyxia and can be extremely dangerous. Ms Marten expressed her commitment not to cause FF any harm, and promised to stick to the advice.\nThe jury was told that an order was made which allowed for FF to be cared for by the couple under social services supervision. This order was discharged in 2018.\nAfter that the couple moved away from Wales, and had three more children.\nBut after the birth of their second child, referred to in court as GG, social services became involved again.\nDuring one home visit, when Ms Marten was heavily pregnant, she hid her body behind a door and said she did not want social services to be \"draconian\".\nAt one point the couple left a child behind in hospital in order to attend a Family Court hearing, even though they had been offered a video link.\nOnce they had been separated from their children they continued to have \"contact sessions\" at which their interaction with the children was described as \"excellent\".\nBut their attendance at the contact sessions was inconsistent. The children were distressed by this. One child became quiet, withdrawn and inconsolable, saying on one occasion: \"Mummy and daddy cancelled again.\"\nAfter assessing the evidence a Family Court judge ordered that the four children should be adopted and care placement orders were made for all four children.\nAs well as manslaughter of baby Victoria, Ms Marten and Mr Gordon are also accused of four other offences: cruelty to their baby; concealment of the baby's birth; causing or allowing her death; and perverting the course of justice by concealing the body.\nThey deny all charges.\nThe trial continues.",

    "Ministers are consulting backbench Tory MPs on watering down planned protections for renters in England.\nThe BBC has seen a series of draft government amendments to a forthcoming bill which aims to ban landlords from evicting tenants without a reason.\nThe proposed changes were circulated with Tory MPs who had expressed concerns about the bill and wanted to increase rights for landlords.\nThe government insisted it would still ban no-fault evictions by the election.\nThe Renters (Reform) Bill was first introduced last May. It would mean that landlords could evict tenants in England only under certain circumstances, including when they wish to sell the property or when they or a close family member want to move in.\nBut the bill has still not passed through the House of Commons.\nAbout 50 Conservative MPs, some of whom are landlords, have expressed opposition to the bill. They fear that the bill would cause landlords to sell up, reducing the number of rental properties available.\nA series of draft government amendments to the bill were circulated for approval on a WhatsApp group of Tory MPs concerned about the bill.\nOne of those Conservative MPs told the BBC: \"Agreement seems to have been reached on nearly all points.\"\nBut Tom Darling, campaign manager of the Renters' Reform Coalition, said: \"It is scandalous and farcical that the government are now outsourcing the writing of the Renters (Reform) Bill to their landlord backbenchers. It reeks of desperation.\"\nThe draft government amendments include putting it in law that the ban on no-fault evictions could not be implemented until an assessment of its impact on the courts had been published by the Justice Secretary.\nIt comes after MPs on the housing select committee last year warned that abolishing no-fault evictions would lead to increased pressure on the courts, because landlords will have to give a reason to remove a tenant, such as rent arrears or antisocial behaviour.\nMr Darling said the government amendment meant the ban on no-fault evictions was \"even further into the long grass\".\nThe National Residential Landlords Association, which represents more than 100,000 landlords, called for renters to have to sign up for at least six months and for measures to \"ensure confidence for all in the court process\".\nIt added that \"uncertainty about the future is destabilising and damaging for those living and working in the private-rented sector\".\nWhen Housing Secretary Michael Gove was asked whether the practice of no-fault evictions would have ended by the time of the next general election, he told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \"We will have outlawed it and we will have put the money into the courts in order to ensure that they enforce that.\"\nThe government is also promising to review the system by which councils can regulate landlords and enforce standards, known as selective licensing.\n'Betrayal'\nIn the documents circulated to potential rebel Tory MPs, the government promised to announce a review of the scheme \"with the explicit aim of reducing burdens on landlords\".\nAmong the other draft amendments the government is suggesting:\nDeputy Labour leader and shadow housing secretary Angela Rayner accused the government of \"yet another betrayal of renters\", adding it was \"yet another example of Rishi Sunak's weakness which means he always puts party before country\".\nShe also called for a statement to be made to MPs, saying the news had emerged in an \"underhand way\".\nLabour has promised to ban no-fault evictions, \"no ifs, no buts\", if it wins a general election.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: \"Our landmark Renters (Reform) Bill will deliver a fairer private rented sector for both tenants and landlords. It will abolish section 21 evictions - giving people more security in their homes and empowering them to challenge poor practices.\n\"We continue to meet regularly with a range of groups, representing all those in the private rented sector.\"",

    "Voters in Michigan have been organising for months to send President Joe Biden a message during the state's primary on Tuesday: \"No ceasefire. No vote.\"\nAfter Mr Biden narrowly defeated Donald Trump in Michigan in the last election in 2020, a protest vote tied to events in Gaza is a real concern for the White House as polling in the primary comes to a close.\nMr Biden and Mr Trump are on course for a rematch in November, and in a close presidential election - as is predicted by most polls - experts say Michigan is a must-win state.\nWith the largest Arab-American population in the US, the state poses a crucial test as to the impact the Biden administration's policy on the Israel-Gaza conflict could have on Democrats.\nThe anger it has created among many in that community has been festering for months, and the Democratic primary on Tuesday has offered the first chance for the party's voters to register that discontent by withholding their vote from the president.\nHe is largely unopposed in the Democratic Party's search for their presidential nominee, but that has not stopped those opposed to his Middle East policy from taking action.\nIn the final hours on the eve of Tuesday's primary election, Khalid Turaani stood outside the Islamic Center of Detroit and distributed pamphlets encouraging people to vote \"uncommitted\" on their ballot papers.\n\"We're doing all that we can to ensure that Biden is a one-term president,\" Mr Turaani, the co-organiser behind Abandon Biden, told the BBC.\n\"In November, we will remember. When you stand against the will of the people, you're going to lose.\"\nTwo grassroots organisations, including Mr Turaani's group, Abandon Biden, and a second, Listen to Michigan, urged Democrats to choose \"uncommitted\" in Tuesday's primary.\nIn the state, each party's candidate list includes an \"uncommitted\" option, which allows a voter to exercise a party vote without selecting a candidate - in this case, Mr Biden.\nThe movement has gained endorsements from at least 39 state and local elected officials. These include congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, Michigan state legislator Abraham Aiyash and Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud.\n\"I was proud today to walk in and pull a Democratic ballot and vote uncommitted,\" Ms Tlaib said in a video shared to social media.\nLexis Zeidan, a co-organiser for Listen to Michigan, said they're hoping to get at least 10,000 people to vote uncommitted.\n\"We want to wake up the next day on Wednesday, and we want to be able to claim Michigan as a pro-Palestinian state,\" she said. \"And we want to inspire communities across the nation to know that, at the end of the day, America is beholden to its people.\"\nOther voters told the BBC they were sticking by the incumbent. Kim Murdough, the office manager of a church in the city of Flint, said she did not have an issue with \"anything that the administration has done\".\n\"As far as Joe Biden's age, I'd rather have someone in office that forgets a few things than a criminal,\" she said, addressing one of the concerns that has been raised over Mr Biden's candidacy.\nMargaret Won said she, too, voted Democrat, adding that she was mostly happy with the work done by Mr Biden's team. She accused Republicans in Congress of blocking his plans.\nMr Biden's victory in this primary election is assured, but Democrats will be watching how many vote \"uncommitted\" to see what electoral harm has been done by the president's support of Israel in its months-long war against Hamas in Gaza.\nRecent national opinion polls suggest a majority of Democrats disapprove of the president's handling of the crisis. In places like Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit where a large concentration of the state's Arab-American population lives, discontent with Democrats appears to be widespread.\nThe president has attempted to walk a tightrope between sending aid to Israel, a longstanding US ally with historically strong support from Democrats, and appeasing those in his party who want the devastation in Gaza to end now.\nSenator Gary Peters, from Michigan, told the BBC and other reporters at a meeting arranged by the Biden campaign on Monday that the president understands voters' concerns about the situation in Gaza.\n\"[President Biden] hears loud and clear what folks are saying. He cares deeply about innocent civilians being caught in that crossfire,\" Sen Peters said. \"And he's going to do everything in his power to bring that to an end as quickly as he can.\"\nThe Biden team has pointed to domestic achievements like job creation, investment in poorer communities and lowering healthcare costs as ways the president has helped voters in Michigan.\nIn one attempt to pacify their frustrations, Mr Biden's campaign staff attempted to organise an in-person meeting with Arab-American leaders in January, a request denied by Dearborn's mayor. \"This is not the time to talk about elections,\" Mayor Hammoud said at the time.\nInstead, he and other community leaders met senior staff from the White House in Februar",
    "Fire crews have been tackling a blaze that broke out in a restaurant in Guernsey in the early hours.\nThe venue involved was Octopus Restaurant in Havelet Bay, St Peter Port, Guernsey Fire and Rescue said.\nPolice have closed roads in the area, with people advised to avoid it until further notice.\nThe fire service said it could be \"some time\" until all roads around La Vallette were reopened.\nThe service added there were no reports of any injuries, and 15 officers were on site.\nPeople living nearby have been told to keep their doors and windows closed.\nGerry Loughlin, who lives nearby, said: \"I heard a commotion outside and I got up and looked out the window, and I could clearly see a fire had broken out at the Octopus Restaurant.\n\"It seemed to have started in the kitchen area and quickly spread along the building, and within half an hour, flames were fanning above the building.\"\nAt a press briefing, station officer Danny Joyce, from Guernsey Fire and Rescue Service, said: \"When we arrived, smoke and flames were going through the roof.\n\"We arrived with two water tenders and a crew of nine... we tried to make entrance into the building, when it was already a deep-seated fire, therefore we could not stay in that building for very long and we had to withdraw.\n\"Our tactics from then on were to fight the fire from outside. Unfortunately...the building is designed to keep out water, so therefore the procedure is longer while fighting from outside.\"\nAdam Miller, from Guernsey Police, appealed for any witnesses to come forward.\nHe said: \"All lines of inquiry at this very early stage are obviously open, and I would therefore ask that if anyone saw suspicious or unusual in the early hours of this morning around the area of La Vallette, to contact us at the police station.\"\n'Absolutely devastated'\nIn a post on social media, Delphine Pesrin-Auder and Mickael Pesrin, who own the restaurant, said they were \"devastated\" but the important thing was that \"nobody was hurt\".\n\"We will, of course, be closed for quite some time, but we will be back!\" they added.\n\"Our sincere thanks to the many police, fire and civil protection professionals who have worked so hard to help us.\n\"Also thanks to our wonderful staff who are as upset as we are, and to all our valued customers, friends, suppliers... many of who have already sent us lovely supportive messages, flowers and cards.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook .

It is now permitted only in cases of rape or incest or when pregnancy threatens a mother's health or life.",

    "A Welsh Labour minister has refused to be drawn into a row about south Wales' new interim chief fire officer.\nHannah Blythyn was asked repeatedly at a Senedd committee about the appointment of Stuart Millington, who is facing an employment tribunal.\nShe declined to say whether she accepted concerns from the Fire Brigades Union.\nMr Millington was appointed by Welsh government commissioners a few weeks ago.\nThe commissioners themselves, who include former Education Minister Kirsty Williams, were appointed by Ms Blythyn after a damning report said the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service had a culture of sexism and misogyny .\nThe service had been left without a chief fire officer after Huw Jakeway resigned, and among the commissioners' first tasks was to pick an interim chief.\nThey chose Stuart Millington, but it since emerged he was subject of a complaint regarding harassment and discrimination from a North Wales Fire and Rescue Service employee.\nIt is understood that Mr Millington denies the allegations. The Fire Brigades Union has passed a vote of no confidence in the interim chief.\nAt a meeting of Equality Committee on Monday Ms Blythyn was questioned about the issue by three different Senedd members. Labour's Sarah Murphy asked whether there had been conversations about how they the commissioners would deal with the vote in no confidence.\nWithout addressing the vote in her answer, Deputy Minister of Social Partnership Ms Blythyn said: \"The current chief has left the post now, and there was an operational vacuum that needed to be filled and they therefore went through the process of recruiting an interim chief fire officer.\n\"They are now keen to move forward with the recruitment that substantive post for chief fire officer.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Sioned Williams asked if Ms Blythyn accepted the concerns of the FBU and whether it \"doesn't look good in terms of restoring the workforce and public's confidence in the radical steps that you are putting in place\".\nMs Blythyn did not address the question directly. \"A decision was needed to be taken on an operational basis for an interim chief officer... it was a decision for our commissioners to take,\" she said.\nShe told Ms Williams that the Welsh government officials were told of the appointment of Mr Millington after the announcement was made.\nThe Liberal Democrats' Jane Dodds later asked whether she accepted there was a lack of confidence.\nMs Blythyn allowed a senior civil servant, Liz Lalley, to respond, who said: \"I think it wouldn't be right for me to comment on the levels of competence around him.\n\"There is, I think, a process that will happen, and there will be a natural justice outcome of that.\n\"I think it's really important to note that the commissioners are in doing some really good work, to support and to lead the fire and rescue service in South Wales through Mr Millington.\n\"I think that sort of that impetus for change is really important context in which we look at where Mr Millington is right now and what he's trying to achieve.\"\nThe committee hearing, which was looking at the governance of fire and rescue services more broadly, also heard that the Welsh government was not aware of the allegations of unacceptable behaviour made in an ITV report in late 2022.\nDan Stephens, chief fire and rescue adviser, said that cultural aspects of a fire service were not something that was routinely inspected.\n\"The focus of my inspections - the thematic inspections that are undertaken - are very much in the operational space,\" he said.\nA Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: \"If Labour are serious about eradicating any inappropriate behaviour and ensuring accountability in our public services, then they must surely recognise this lapse in judgement by their commissioners, reconsider the appropriateness of the appointment itself, and conduct a full nation-wide review of all fire and rescue services in Wales.\"",
    "An Israeli man has been killed and 13 other people have been wounded in an attack by three Palestinian gunmen near an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, police and medics say.\nThe attackers fired automatic weapons at vehicles waiting at a checkpoint on a highway outside Maale Adumim.\nSecurity forces and armed civilians killed two of the attackers while the third was detained, police said.\nPalestinian armed group Hamas praised the attack but did not claim it.\nThere has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel on 7 October.\nAt least 394 Palestinians - members of armed groups, attackers and civilians - had been killed in conflict-related incidents in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, or in Israel as of Tuesday, according to the UN. During the same period, 12 Israelis, including four security forces personnel, had been killed.\nIsrael's police force said Thursday's attack took place near the al-Zaim checkpoint on Highway 1, which connects Maale Adumim with Jerusalem.\nThe three Palestinian gunmen arrived at the scene in two separate vehicles, armed with weapons including an M-16 rifle and a Carlo sub-machine gun. After getting out, they opened fire towards vehicles stuck in a traffic jam.\nTwo of the attackers were shot dead by security forces and armed civilians at the scene. The third gunmen tried to escape but was \"neutralised\" and taken into custody.\nIsrael's Magen David Adom ambulance service said paramedics found casualties in five vehicles along a 500m-long (1,640ft) stretch of the highway.\nA man who was later identified as Matan Elmaliach, a 26-year-old man from Maale Adumim, died of his wounds at the scene, it said.\nThirteen other people were wounded, including a 23-year-old pregnant woman who was shot in the upper body and is in a serious condition.\nEight people were taken to Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, and five to Shaare Zedek Hospital.\nThe attackers were identified as three Palestinian men, including two brothers, from the West Bank city of Bethlehem, 10km (6 miles) to the south-west.\nIsrael's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, told journalists at the scene: \"The enemies... want to hurt us. They hate us.\"\nHe said authorities needed to \"distribute more weapons\" to Israeli civilians for protection and install more roadblocks around Palestinian communities in the West Bank, arguing that \"our right to life is superior to the freedom of movement\" of Palestinians.\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, another far-right politician, meanwhile called for the immediate approval of plans for thousands more homes in settlements like Maale Adumim.\nIsrael has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel and the US dispute this.\nHamas called Thursday's attack a \"natural response\" to Israeli \"massacres and crimes\" in Gaza and the West Bank, and called on Palestinians to take up arms.\nThe shooting comes six days after a Palestinian man shot and killed two people at a bus stop near the southern Israeli town of Kiryat Malakhi.",

    "On Thursday a fire swept through a 14-storey apartment block in the Spanish city of Valencia, killing 10 people. The BBC's Mark Lowen has spoken to the last couple to be rescued from the inferno.\n\"Once we jumped from our flat to a balcony and could see the flames all around us, that was the moment we thought we were going to die there\", says Sara Jorge.\n\"But I said to my boyfriend: 'I refuse to die.' The conditions around us were telling us it would happen - but I just knew it wasn't our time,\" she adds.\nThe 26-year-old from Portugal and her Belgian boyfriend were the couple in the dramatic rescue video from Thursday's fire in Valencia, hoisted to safety by firefighters as flames raged around them, onlookers applauding what appeared to be a miracle.\nWe speak in the hotel where they've been moved, in her first interview with an international journalist.\nSara and her boyfriend were working in their apartment in the coastal Spanish city when they started hearing sirens. A fire had broken out in the next-door building, fourteen stories high.\nWithin minutes it had engulfed the tower. Their block was linked by a bridge - and the blaze soon spread to their building too, where they lived on the eighth floor.\n\"We thought at first it was something minimal as we weren't seeing smoke\", she recalls. \"We opened our door and a neighbour said we should go down to the street. So we gathered some things but then when we were coming out, the two girls who lived opposite said everything seemed to be under control and that we should stay at home. So we went back inside. It was very stupid. Soon after, we started seeing the smoke.\"\nBy the time they decided to leave, their building had been swamped by the blaze - and they couldn't get down the corridor.\nThe wind, which was gusting at some 60km/h (40mph), had changed direction and was fanning the flames towards their part of the building. So they jumped to a side balcony.\n\"We refused to hug because that was a sign of giving up\", she says. \"We gave each other just a little kiss. And then we started seeing the firemen coming towards us.\"\nThe couple thought the first firefighter would begin the rescue - but he was preparing the area, dousing it with water for a second team to be able to move up.\nSara recalls repeatedly shouting \"come and save us\" amidst the confusion. For over an hour, they waited on the balcony, breaking the glass so they could climb through. Finally, another firefighter reached them with a crane.\nThey were the last couple to be saved from the burning wreckage of their tower. Ten people are now known to have died in the blaze.\n\"We only realised that everybody was watching us coming down as we got to the ground - and later saw the video\", she says. \"That was when we understood how lucky we had been.\"\nTwo days on, Sara says she feels numb, still unable to let her emotion out. But when she sees the couple from her neighbouring flat, the tears flow as they hug. Manuel Diaz tells me his girlfriend, who was at home when the fire began, is in shock.\n\"We feel in a mental battle\", he says, \"because we lost everything - but we're alive. And that's the most important.\"\nAn investigation has begun into the fire, which began in one apartment in the larger tower and quickly spread. The cladding - the material used on the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade - is suspected of being a major factor, with reports that it was banned in 2019 because of its flammability, but that it was not subsequently removed from buildings that had used it.\nSara tells me she knew the tower had been cheaply built and that the infrastructure was poor, due to frequent flooding. When it rained, walls in the upstairs apartment would flood. Repair teams would repaint and move on.\n\"There were a lot of red flags\", she says. \"But people had their lives there - we had a comfortable apartment, so we stayed. Now I just can't understand why they let that material stay on the building after it was banned. One day, it was so windy and a piece of it just flew off.\"\nThe towers are now just blackened shells, the life sucked out of them. The larger one, where the fire began, had 138 apartments and around 450 residents.\nThose displaced have been told they will stay in hotels until the end of the month and will then be given accommodation in newly-built social housing. Residents have started a fundraising page, on GoFundMe, to help with costs, including paying for funerals of those who didn't make it.\nOn the main square in Valencia, outside the city hall, residents gather for a few minutes' silence. Heads are bowed, some wipe away tears. Then applause rings out for firefighters and some families caught up in the tragedy.\nSara says she hasn't been able to contact the firefighters since the blaze. When they made it down, they hugged their rescuers - and were then quickly moved to a medical tent and then hospital for checks.\n\"When we were on the balcony, I could see the firemen looking at us straight in their eyes. That was trust. I felt they couldn't l",

I wasn't hanging round on the street, it was school, football - nothing else.\n\"When I signed my professional contract everyone looked at me like 'woah' - and you have a certain respect among your peers.\n\"Now I'm thinking people will look at me and think: 'What happened to you? You used to be a pro, you used to be that guy'.\"\n'It's a dog-eat-dog world'\nJayden said he wanted to use his story as a way of inspiring other athletes battling injuries to find the courage to speak out about their struggle.\n\"You want to put on a brave face, especially in the football culture,\" he said.\n\"It's a dog-eat-dog world every day. You're being judged and you don't want to give them something else to judge you about.\n\"I want to be an advocate for speaking out when you need help, because that's the bravest thing you can do.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Nigeria has imposed a mandatory annual levy for organisations employing expatriate workers, requiring them to pay $15,000 (\u00c2\u00a312,000) for a director and $10,000 for other employees.\nThe move is meant to encourage foreign companies to employ more Nigerian workers.\nStaff of diplomatic missions and government officials are exempt.\nPresident Bola Tinubu has warned that the levy should not be used to frustrate potential investors.\nHe spoke while launching the Expatriate Employment Levy (EEL) handbook on Tuesday, adding that the government was expecting to improve revenue and indigenisation.\nHe said that its aim was to balance employment opportunities between Nigerians and expatriates.\n\"The goal is to close wage gaps between expatriates and the Nigerian labour force while increasing employment opportunities for qualified Nigerians in foreign companies in the country,\" he said.\nThere are more than 150,000 expatriates in Nigeria, according to local media citing data from the interior ministry.\nThey mostly work in the oil and gas, construction, telecommunication and hospitality sectors.\nNigeria is one of Africa's biggest oil producers. Its oil and gas exports account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nIt already costs companies in Nigeria $2,000 a year to obtain a residency permit for each foreign employee.\nThe move comes as Nigeria is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation, which has led to widespread hardship and anger in recent months.\nLabour unions and government workers on Tuesday held demonstrations to protest against economic hardships.\nMr Tinubu acknowledged that Nigerians were going through a difficult period.\nHe said efforts were being made to improve the country's finances and grow the economy.\nThe levy applies to employees who work for at least 183 days in a year.\nThe scheme imposes fines of up three years and jail terms of up to five years for a person or organisations that do not comply, including failure to provide accurate information.\nThe Nigerian Immigration Service will be responsible for enforcing the levy.\nLocal media quoted Interior Minister Olubunmi Tunji-Oj as saying that it would be operated on a  public-private partnership model between the government, the immigration service and a private firm.\nNigerian economist Abubakar Abdullahi says the levy is good for the country and won't frustrate potential investors as \"they'll love to see the country grow as well\".\"I believe Nigeria stands to benefit from this levy as more companies will start looking inwards as there are qualified Nigerians from all sectors,\" he says.\nAdditional reporting by Mansur Abubakar\nMore about Nigeria's economy:",

    "The SNP in Westminster is considering a campaign of \"disengagement\" with day-to-day parliamentary activities, according to party sources.\nThey said MPs could cause disruption or pull back from some activities.\nIt follows a breakdown in relations between the party and the House of Commons Speaker over an SNP debate about Gaza.\nHowever, the party's leader at Westminster, Stephen Flynn, denied that the SNP was planning to disengage.\nLast week, the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, allowed a Labour amendment to be voted on during an SNP debate on calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. It meant the SNP's own motion was not voted on.\nHis decision was met with calls for him to resign as Speaker from some SNP and Conservative MPs, with Sir Lindsay apologising to the SNP at the time for his handling of the issue.\nHe also indicated that he would allow a fresh debate under emergency rules - before announcing on Monday that he would not be doing so.\nSir Lindsay said he understood the UK government was \"ready to make a relevant statement\" on Tuesday so there would be an imminent opportunity for MPs to discuss the issue without holding an emergency debate.\nThe statement was made by Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell, who said calling for a ceasefire would not be enough to make one happen and restated the government's position.\n\"We are trying to negotiate an immediate pause in order that we can get the hostages out and get incredibly badly needed aid in, leading to a sustainable ceasefire,\" he said.\nAnger has not died down within the SNP, with the party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn accusing the Speaker of having \"effectively lied\".\nAn early day motion of no confidence in the Speaker had been signed by 86 SNP, Conservative and Plaid Cymru MPs by Tuesday night.\nWhat does disengagement look like?\n\"Disengaging\" with the House of Commons could include not turning up to committees on which the SNP has a seat or refusing to turn up to debates held outside of the main Commons chamber - for example in Westminster Hall.\nIt is understood the disengagement would still mean SNPs MPs coming to Westminster.  A lack of a presence in parliament was not considered.\nIt is understood that more \"dramatic\" options to disrupt proceedings are also being considered.\nThe strategy has yet to be finalised but the party is seeking to keep up the pressure on the Speaker and Parliament.\nIt wants to send a message in Scotland during an election year about what the party sees as the \"bigger issue\": the SNP allegedly being failed by Westminster and treated as \"an irrelevance\", according to those close to the leadership.\nOne SNP source told the BBC the party was considering a strategy of \"disengagement\" with some day-to-day parliamentary activities.\nAnother SNP source said: \"We are acutely aware we could cause a lot of problems down here that could disrupt the process [of the House].\n\"We don't want to cause trouble for the sake of it - there's a purpose to everything we're trying to do.\"\nSNP will not 'leave Scotland voiceless'\nHowever, the party's leader at Westminster, Stephen Flynn, denied that the SNP was planning to disengage.\nHe posted on social media to say the importance of the SNP's role in Westminster had been exemplified over the controversy.\nMr Flynn said: \"No, they aren't [considering disengagement].\n\"The importance of our role has been exemplified these last few weeks, driving debate over Gaza and changing Labour Party policy.\n\"Until we achieve our independence, we will never leave Scotland voiceless in Westminster.\"\nThe SNP and some Conservative MPs are expected to further vocalise their unhappiness with the Speaker at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.\nThe SNP is also pushing for a \"full, independent investigation\" into claims that Sir Keir Starmer deliberately put pressure on the Speaker to give Labour a vote on its ceasefire amendment during the SNP's Opposition Day debate - claims the Labour leader denies.\nA Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \"The SNP have disengaged with Westminster for years, delivering nothing for communities across Scotland.\n\"At the general election, Scotland has a chance not just to send a message but to send a government who will work to deliver the change that Scotland needs.\"",

    "Fewer smokers in England now see vaping as less harmful than cigarettes, despite evidence tobacco is far worse for health and e-cigarettes can help smokers quit, data suggests.\nPerceptions are shifting, according to survey responses from more than 28,000 current smokers between 2014 and 2023.\nThe latest round of results found 57% thought vaping just as harmful as smoking or more so.\nIdeally, people should neither vape nor smoke, the NHS says.\nVaping exposes users to far fewer toxins and at lower levels than smoking cigarettes.\nCigarettes release thousands of different chemicals when they burn.\nMany are poisonous and up to 70 cause cancer.\nThey also cause other serious illnesses, including lung disease, heart disease and stroke.\nMost of the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke, including tar and carbon monoxide, are not in vape aerosol.\nBut vaping is not risk-free. And the NHS advises non-smokers and young people under the age of 18 not to start.\nCommon side effects of vaping include:\nThe data, published in the journal JAMA Network Open comes from a Cancer Research UK-funded weekly survey running since 2006 to track national smoking patterns and inform stop-smoking policies.\nIn November 2014:\nBut by June 2023:\nIt's not clear what is behind the trends - the study didn't look at that. But stop smoking experts are concerned.\nOne of the researchers, Dr Sarah Jackson, from University College London (UCL), said: \"These findings have important implications for public health.\n\"The risks of vaping are much lower than the risks of smoking - and this isn't being clearly communicated to people.\n\"This misperception is a health risk in and of itself, as it may discourage smokers from substantially reducing their harm by switching to e-cigarettes.\n\"It may also encourage some young people who use e-cigarettes to take up smoking for the first time, if they believe the harms are comparable.\n\"Better communication about the health risks is needed so that adults who smoke can make informed choices about the nicotine products they use.\"\nProf Jamie Brown, also from UCL, said: \"E-cigarettes are novel and so have attracted much attention in the media, with news articles often overstating their risks to health compared with smoking.\n\"There is relatively little reporting about deaths caused by smoking, even though 75,000 people die as a result of it in England each year.\n\"The government plans to offer one million smokers a free vaping starter kit alongside behavioural support to help them quit.\n\"This initiative may be undermined if many smokers are unwilling to try e-cigarettes because they wrongly believe them to be just as harmful as cigarettes or more so.\"\nSimon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, agreed that there had to be better communication about the relative risk of different nicotine products, including combustible tobacco and e-cigarettes, but added: \"Government is partly to blame for the confusion because banning disposable vapes and threatening to severely restrict the display and packaging of e-cigarettes is hardly the best way to promote a reduced risk product that has helped millions of smokers to quit.\n\"Furthermore, is it any wonder that smokers are confused about the perceived risk of vaping when the message coming from government and the public health industry is that the only people who should vape are adults who want to quit smoking, and no-one should vape long-term or recreationally.\"\nAction on Smoking and Health (Ash) chief executive Deborah Arnott said \"scare stories\" about young people vaping could be causing the growing misconception among adult smokers that vaping was at least as risky as smoking.\n\"There are millions of smokers who may, as a result, never try the most effective and easily available quitting aid, the e-cigarette,\" she said.\n\"The tragedy is that as a result many smokers may carry on smoking when they could have quit, continuing to put themselves at serious risk of cancers, respiratory and heart disease, followed by premature death.\"",

    "An Illinois judge has ruled that Donald Trump engaged in insurrection and has barred him from the state's primary ballot - though she put the ruling on hold pending an appeal.\nTwo other states - Colorado and Maine - have removed Mr Trump from their primary ballots for violating a 14th Amendment \"insurrection\" clause.\nThe final outcome will likely be decided by the US Supreme Court.\nIllinois' primary election is scheduled for 19 March.\nEarly voting in the primary has already begun.\nMr Trump - the front-runner Republican presidential candidate -  filed an appeal of the decision on Thursday. He is also asking for the ruling to be put on pause until the issue is fully resolved either by a state court or a federal one.\nCook County circuit judge Tracie Porter agreed with voters who argued Mr Trump had violated the US constitution's 14th Amendment because of his role in the 6 January Capitol riot.\nIt comes after Colorado's Supreme Court barred Mr Trump from appearing on the Republican primary ballot in December, arguing Mr Trump's actions during the 2021 Capitol riot amounted to insurrection.\nIn her ruling, Judge Porter called Colorado's rationale \"compelling\".

    "Labour has called for Tory MP Lee Anderson to lose the whip over what it described as \"Islamophobic\" comments about Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.\nHe told GB News Islamists had \"got control\" of Mr Khan and he had \"given our capital city away to his mates\".\nHis words, which follow pro-Palestinian protests outside Parliament, have also been condemned by Tories.\nLabour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said the remarks were \"unambiguously racist and Islamophobic\".\nWriting on X, she said Rishi Sunak \"needs to immediately remove the whip\" from Mr Anderson, while Labour's shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth made the same call in a letter to the prime minister, describing the Ashfield MP's words as \"appalling racism and Islamophobia\".\nWithdrawing the whip would see Mr Anderson essentially expelled from his party in Parliament.\nA Conservative source told the BBC: \"Lee was simply making the point that the mayor, in his capacity as Police and Crime Commissioner for London, has abjectly failed to get a grip on the appalling Islamist marches we have seen in London recently.\"\nOn Wednesday, protesters assembled at Parliament in response to a proposed vote on a ceasefire tabled by the SNP - which in itself sparked controversy related to how the vote was handled.\nMr Anderson's comments followed an article by former Home Secretary Suella Braverman in the Daily Telegraph, in which she said \"the truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now\".\nIn an apparent reference to the article, Mr Anderson said he did not \"actually believe that these Islamists have got control of our country\" but he did believe they have \"got control of Khan and they've got control of London\", and that they have \"got control of Starmer as well\".\nMr Khan has been mayor of London since 2016 and is the first Muslim to hold the position.\nWriting on X, former Conservative Chancellor Sajid Javid reposted the video of Mr Anderson making the comments and wrote \"a ridiculous thing to say\".\nLeader of Conservative party at City Hall, Neil Garratt, said he had \"no shortage of criticisms of Mayor Khan\" but that \"he is not an Islamist, he is not in the pockets of Islamists, and I completely disagree with anyone who says otherwise\".\nIman Atta, director of charity Tell Mama, which describes itself as the leading agency on monitoring anti-Muslim hate crime in the UK, called the Tory MP's remarks \"highly offensive, highly dangerous\".\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Atta said the Mayor of London is subjected to many anti-Muslim attacks \"on an ongoing basis\", adding that it was important that politicians \"send a clear message that anti-Muslim hate is unacceptable, as antisemitism is unacceptable in our country\".\nUntil January Mr Anderson served as one of the deputy chairmen of the Conservative Party but he resigned so he could rebel against the government over the Rwanda vote.\nHe is currently one of a number of Conservative MPs who present a GB News show.\nMeanwhile, former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss has come under fire for promoting conspiracy theories about why her reign as prime minister ended after only 49 days during appearances at conservative events in the United States.\nShe left office after a period of political and economic turbulence, which forced her government to ditch tax cuts that sent financial markets into a tailspin.\nShe has been criticised for not interjecting during a panel discussion with former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon, in which he called the former leader of the English Defence League and anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson a \"hero\".\nMr Ashworth, who also asked for the prime minister to remove the whip from Ms Truss, said: \"For a senior politician to engage in spreading such blatant conspiracy theories is incredibly damaging to our democracy, our institutions and social cohesion.\"\nHe added: \"As you know as well as anyone, it was not a cabal of secretive actors in the civil service working against Liz Truss' \u00c2\u00a345bn of unfounded tax cuts that sent financial markets into turmoil and ended her premiership, but the opposite.\"\nThe BBC has approached the Conservative Party for comment.",
    "An effectively bankrupt council in Surrey has encouraged residents to donate to a fund in an attempt to support community groups that had their funding cut.\nWoking Borough Council previously imposed emergency spending restrictions on itself due to its \u00c2\u00a32bn debt.\nAll spending for non-essential services was halted after the Section 114 notice was issued.\nIt has asked \"those with the broadest shoulders\" to support the groups.\nThe restrictions meant community groups and volunteer services across the borough had their grant funding slashed.\nAmong the high-profile cuts were Citizens Advice Woking, community transport and the Lightbox theatre, while fees at Pool in the Park are also increasing to cover the loss of its council funding.\nThe council said it was now hoping to encourage residents to donate to a community fund.\nDeputy council leader Will Forster said the local authority was to make \u00c2\u00a38.4m in spending cuts and lose 20 per cent of its staff.\n\"The council just doesn't have the cash to give out to non-statutory services,\" he said.\n\"I appreciate the voluntary sector needs more money, but we as a council don't have it. This council should ask residents, especially those in the Band H council tax group, the most expensive houses, to voluntarily contribute to the Woking Community Fund to support our voluntary sector.\"\nHowever, opposition members have described the measures as \"a bit cheeky\" given the expected 10 per cent tax hike later this year.\nIf residents choose to contribute, they will be asked whether their donation should go to particular priorities such as hardship advice, transport for the vulnerable or more general priorities.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "An Indian woman has accused a manager at one of the country's largest banks of defrauding her by siphoning off 160m rupees ($1.9m; \u00c2\u00a31.5m) from her account.\nShveta Sharma says she had transferred money to the ICICI Bank from her US account, expecting it to be invested in fixed deposits.\nBut she alleges that a bank official created \"fake accounts, forged her signature, took out debit cards and cheque books in her name\" to withdraw money from her accounts.\n\"He gave me fake statements, created a fake email ID in my name and manipulated my mobile number in the bank records so I won't get any withdrawal notifications,\" she told the BBC.\nA spokesman for the bank admitted to the BBC that \"indeed the fraud had happened\" but said that the ICICI \"is a bank of repute which holds trillions of rupees in deposits from millions of customers\".\n\"Whoever is involved will be punished,\" he added.\nMs Sharma and her husband, who returned to India in 2016 after living for decades in the US and Hong Kong, met a banker through a friend.\nAs the interest rate on bank deposits in the US was negligible, he advised Ms Sharma to move her money to India where fixed deposits were offering an interest of 5.5% to 6%.\nShe opened an NRE account meant for non-resident Indians on his advice after visiting the ICICI's branch in old Gurugram near the capital, Delhi, and in 2019, began transferring money into it from her US account.\n\"Over a period of four years from September 2019 to December 2023, we deposited our entire life savings of around 135m rupees in the bank,\" she said, adding that \"with interest, the sum would have grown to more than 160m rupees\".\nShe said she never suspected anything was amiss because the branch manager \"would give me proper receipts for all the deposits on bank's stationery, regularly send me email statements from his ICICI account and sometimes even come over with folders of documents\".\nThe fraud came to light in early January when a new employee at the bank offered to get Ms Sharma better returns on her money.\nIt was then that she discovered that all her fixed deposits had vanished. There was also an overdraft of 25m rupees taken on one of the deposits.\n\"My husband and I were shocked. I suffer from an autoimmune disorder and I was so traumatised that I couldn't get up from bed for an entire week,\" she told me. \"Your life is being ruined right in front of your eyes and you can't do anything about it.\"\nMs Sharma says she has shared all the information with the bank and held several meetings with top officials.\n\"At our first meeting on 16 January, we met the bank's regional and zonal heads and the head of the bank's internal vigilance who had flown in from Mumbai. They told us they accepted that it had been their fault, that this branch manager had cheated us.\n\"They assured us that we will get all our money back. But first, they said, they needed my help in identifying fraudulent transactions.\"\nMs Sharma and her team of accountants spent days going through the statements for the past four years. Her accountants then sat with the vigilance team to mark the transactions which they were \"100% sure\" were fraudulent.\n\"It was shocking to actually discover how the money had been siphoned from my account and where it had been spent.\"\nMs Sharma says despite the bank's assurances that the issue would be resolved within two weeks, more than six weeks later, she's still waiting to see any of her money back.\nIn the meantime, she has sent letters to the CEO and deputy CEO of ICICI and lodged complaints with the Reserve Bank of India - the country's central bank - and the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi police, which deals with financial crimes.\nIn a statement sent to the BBC, the bank said they have offered to deposit 92.7m rupees into her account with a lien, pending the outcome of the investigation.\nBut Ms Sharma has rejected the offer: \"It's a lot less than the 160m rupees they owe me and the lien would effectively mean the account would be frozen until the case is closed by the police, which could take years.\"\n\"Why am I being punished for no fault of mine? My life has turned upside-down. I can't sleep. I have daily nightmares,\" she added.\nSrikanth L, who runs a fintech watchdog called Cashless Consumer, says such cases are not very common and banks use audits and checks to ensure such things don't happen.\nBut if your bank manager decides to defraud you, he says, there's little you can do.\n\"Since he was the bank manager, she had some implicit trust in him. But customers must be more vigilant. They must monitor the outflow of money from their account at all times.\n\"The lack of double checks on a customer's part can lead to this kind of fraud,\" he adds.\nThis is the second time just this month that ICICI bank has been in the news for the wrong reason.\nEarlier this month, police in Rajasthan state said a branch manager and his aides had duped depositors of billions of rupees for years to meet targets set up by the bank.\nPoli",

    "The government is considering announcing a new tax on vapes at the Budget next week.\nCurrently, vaping products are subject to VAT - but unlike tobacco, they are not also subject to a dedicated levy.\nTobacco duty could also increase at the Budget, to ensure that vaping remains cheaper.\nMinisters fear that the relatively cheap cost of vaping means that the products are more accessible for young people and non-smokers.\nThe government first said it was considering a vaping levy at November's King's Speech, citing a \"significant differential\" with tax on tobacco.\nAccording to the Times, which first reported the story , the new duty will be levied on the liquid in vapes, with higher tax rates for products with more nicotine.\nTreasury analysis suggests the new vaping tax, along with the rise in tobacco duty, could eventually raise around \u00c2\u00a3500m a year.\nThe separate tax on tobacco products was raised by 2% more than inflation last year as part of the Autumn Statement. Official economic forecasts predict tobacco duty will raise \u00c2\u00a310.4bn this year, driven by the higher rate.\nVaping products and non-tobacco nicotine are taxed at 20% VAT, with a lower 5% rate for e-cigarettes regulated as medicines.\nUnder the government's \"swap to stop\" scheme in England, traditional smokers can get free vaping \"starter packs\" to help them quit tobacco.\nThe NHS recommends nicotine vaping as a way for adult smokers to quit tobacco. It says vaping is \"substantially less harmful\", although it is \"not completely harmless\".\nSeveral European countries have e-cigarette taxes, with the European Commission planning to introduce a minimum level across the EU.\n'Black market' fears\nThe UK Vaping Industry Association, an industry body for vape manufacturers, said a new tax would \"penalise\" smokers who have made the switch from tobacco.\nJohn Dunne, its director general, added it would also make vapes a \"less accessible\" alternative for people in poorer areas with the highest smoking rates.\nHe argued that it could also \"fuel a black market which is already in danger of being out of control\".\nIt comes after plans were announced last month to deliver a UK-wide ban on disposable vapes, alongside restrictions on flavours and how they can be packaged.\nUK government ministers, who are responsible for delivering the ban in England, say they hope to pass the relevant legislation before the next election.\nThe ban would then come into force in early 2025, with retailers given six months to make the changes once the timing is confirmed.\nBudget warning\nThe government also plans to increase fines for retailers that sell vapes to under-18s, which is illegal.\nNext week's Budget will see the government unveil its tax and spending plans for the year ahead amid the backdrop of sluggish economic growth.\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt has hinted he would like to lower taxes, in what could be the last Budget before a general election.\nBut the Institute of Fiscal Studies, a think-tank, has said the UK is in a \"poor position\" to do so.\nIt noted that at the Autumn Statement, the chancellor was \"only just\" on course to meet the government's rule that official forecasts should show debt falling as a share of national income in five years' time.\nDo you think a new vaping tax is a good idea?

    "The Pentagon has cleared US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin of wrongdoing over his failure to disclose hospital stays related to his cancer diagnosis.\nA three-page defence department report released on Monday found no \"indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate\" by Mr Austin or his staff.\nThe Pentagon chief has apologised for not notifying government leaders about hospital stays in December and January.\nMr Austin, 70, has been undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.\nMr Austin's actions have drawn criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike and stoked concerns about both transparency and security.\nThe defence secretary is just below the president in the chain of command for the US military and is regarded as one of the most important members of the cabinet.\nThe unclassified internal review published on Monday partly blames the lack of communication on an \"unprecedented situation\" and says Mr Austin's staff were attempting to protect his medical privacy.\n\"The process for making decisions to transfer the Secretary's authority could and should be improved,\" the report says, adding that \"nothing examined during this review demonstrated any indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate\".\nIt says that his team began a \"transfer of authority\" to his deputy on 2 January - one day after he entered hospital and as he was being taken into critical care.\nIt was not until 4 January that the White House and Mr Austin's deputy - who was on leave in Puerto Rico - were made aware of his admission to hospital.\nEarlier this month, Mr Austin apologised for keeping his medical situation a secret.\n\"We did not handle this right, and I did not handle this right.

    "A DNA test has revealed a dying man who claimed to be one of Japan's most wanted criminals was telling the truth.\nSatoshi Kirishima made his confession in January, telling police \"I want to meet my death with my real name\".\nOfficials have now confirmed the 70-year-old was indeed Kirishima, a member of a militant group behind several deadly bombings in the 1970s.\nExactly how he remained at large for so long - despite his face adorning posters across Japan - is unclear.\nKirishima is suspected of helping plant and detonate a homemade bomb that destroyed part of a building in Tokyo's Ginza district on 18 April 1975, according to local media. There were no casualties.\nAt the time, he belonged to the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front, a radical, left-wing organisation believed to be behind several bombings against companies in Japan's capital Tokyo in the 70s - including one targeting a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries building which left eight dead and more than 160 injured.\nKirishima is alleged to have been involved in four other attacks the group carried out. Two other members were sentenced to death for their involvement in attacks.\nIt is thought he is the only member of the group never caught by police, not that they ever gave up: a picture of the long-haired, bespectacled 20-something university student has been appearing on posters outside police stations across the country for decades.\nYet despite his image being widely publicised, neighbours were seemingly caught unawares when his identity was revealed last month, with one describing him to Mainichi newspaper as a \"calm and serious\" man - albeit with a tendency to play guitar in his room after a few drinks.\nKirishima, who had been going under the name Hiroshi Uchida, had reportedly lived in the city of Fujisawa, on the western edge of Tokyo, for almost 40 years.\nHe told police he had worked day labour jobs before ending up working at a construction company, Japan's Asahi newspaper reported. Broadcaster NHK said he had been paid in cash and didn't have a phone to help him stay under the radar.\nAnd it seems he had neither a driver's licence nor any health insurance when he appeared at the hospital seeking treatment for terminal cancer.\nIt was only at that point he revealed his real identity, with staff then alerting police.\nPolice say he was able to recount details about both his family and the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front only he would have known during interviews in the days before his death on 29 January. He also denied some of the allegations, a source told Kyodo News agency .\nA Tokyo police spokesperson confirmed to AFP news agency that the DNA test had now further backed up his claims, with the case files involving Kirishima being sent to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office.\nHowever, police will also continue to investigate whether or not anyone helped Kirishima stay undetected for all this time, according to Kyodo News.",

    "A woman whose TikTok videos about a stately home in the movie Saltburn were viewed more than five million times said it was \"a shame\" fans were trespassing, after the estate's owner reportedly complained.\nDrayton House in Northamptonshire was used for location filming.\nRhian Williams, whose video about its location went viral, said she made it clear there was a public footpath.\nThe BBC has asked the estate owner to comment.\nEmerald Fennell's Saltburn was released in November and has proved a hit with audiences, especially online, where content producers paying tribute to the film's use of Murder On the Dancefloor helped propel Sophie Ellis-Bextor back into the top 10 of the charts in January .\nSet in a huge country house, Saltburn explores themes including sex, power and class.\nIt follows Jacob Elordi's character Felix, a university student from an extremely rich family, who takes friend Oliver, played by Barry Keoghan, home to Saltburn for the summer.\nDrayton House, a Grade I listed private home near the village of Lowick was chosen to portray the eponymous Saltburn mansion.\nHome to the Sackville family since the 18th Century, it is not generally open to the public.\nHowever, the film's location did not remain private for long and was soon identified by journalists and social media users.\nRhian Williams, who lives nearby, posted two TikTok videos about \"how to get to Saltburn\" and view the property.\nHowever, after reports that the estate owner had had to bring in private security because of the number of visitors coming on to the land, Ms Williams told the BBC: \"When I made my TikToks about the location of Drayton House, which I discovered online, I never dreamt they would get 5.6 million views.\n\"It's such a shame that people are trespassing as there is a public footpath through the estate that everyone should stick to if they want to visit.\n\"I do think it's important that younger generations, like so many who have enjoyed the Saltburn movie, are encouraged to walk in the countryside and get fresh air, and it's brilliant to see such a hidden corner of our beautiful Northamptonshire in such a major film like Saltburn.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A film studio plans to invest millions of pounds in local infrastructure in a bid to receive planning permission from the local authority.\nBuckinghamshire Council could not reach a decision on Marlow Film Studios' plans for Marlow quarry in October .\nCouncillors deferred the decision to further consider issues related to the green belt and local highways.\nThe studio's updated plans revealed over \u00c2\u00a320m will be invested in roads and other public infrastructure.\nThis includes upgrading the A404's Westhorpe junction, establishing two new public bus services, and installing cycling routes.\nIt is hoped their investment will resolve \"long-standing capacity issues and current dangerous queuing on the A404 slip roads and carriageway\".\nRobert Laycock, CEO of Marlow Film Studios said: \"These improvements to the roads and bus services in South Bucks are only a part of the major benefits unlocked by the studios for the local area, its residents and its economy.\"\nPlanning officers had recommended that permission was refused for the studio, however councillors instead voted to defer the decision so further analysis could take place.\nChairman councillor Alan Turner said he believed deferring the decision to be \"the safest route\".\n\"I'm the last person who wants to see green belt disappear, but I'm also minded of the impacts, not just the negative impacts but the positive impacts, of what a development might bring forward,\" he said.\nResponding to the council's concerns about the site's proximity to an area of outstanding natural beauty, the studio said it had carried out a \"more detailed landscape assessment\".\nThe new planning submission includes additional planting north of the A4155 to \"further restrict views of the development\".\nThe studio said it meets the \"very special circumstances\" required for a green belt development.\nThe campaign group Save Marlow's Greenbelt said: \"There is nothing in the amended planning documents that alters our fundamental objections.\n\"It will destroy valuable green belt, harm the environment, and cause significant traffic congestion.\n\"These issues have already led Buckinghamshire Council's planning officer to recommend refusal and the new documents provide no reason why that decision should be changed.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Military officers and senior soldiers have said they will quit the Army in droves over new accommodation rules.\nCurrently, military personnel are entitled to subsidised housing based on their rank, but the Ministry of Defence (MoD) wants to change the rules to focus on families' needs.\nThe plan could mean many officers will lose entitlement to larger housing.\nIt is feared the crisis in army recruitment and retention could get worse if the new plans are implemented.\nThe BBC has obtained testimony from more than 20 officers and their partners - in a sign of growing protest over the new policy.\nOne said: \"Signed off before Christmas and changes to service family accommodation was one of the factors that influenced us as a childless couple\".\nDozens more said they were ready to \"walk out the door\".\nMore than 300 officers took part in a survey on social media and 78% said they would be prepared to leave if their accommodation entitlement is reduced.\nAn online petition calling for a review of the policy has already received 18,000 signatures.\nThe MoD will launch its New Accommodation Offer (NAO) for military personnel in March.\nUnder the new offer, a married major with no children would be entitled to a two-bedroom property instead of a three- or four-bedroom house - leaving them with around 38% less space.\nA married private with three children will get a larger house - gaining around 27% more space.\nRosie Bucknall, the wife of a major, said in theory it sounds like a great initiative \"but in practice it adds further stress and uncertainty for families constantly on the move\".\nShe and her husband currently live in a three-bedroom military house, but under the new rules they would be entitled to a two-bedroom flat.\nMany officers and their families see it as the removal of one of the last remaining perks to deal with the unpredictability of service life - which sees many posted to different locations every few years.\nMost of the testimony obtained by the BBC has been given anonymously. One lieutenant colonel said: \"Based on the new accommodation model, we have decided that remaining in service is no longer a tenable situation for us\".\nAnother lieutenant colonel said: \"I have started to consider leaving since the announcement of this policy. It's the removal of another perk, and the pros no longer outweigh the cons.\"\nAn army captain said: \"I could conceive of no single policy better placed to drive quality officers out of the service and tear the heart out of the organisation\".\nHe added that he was planning to resign within the next two years, saying: \"Anecdotally, most of my peers are also now planning to leave on varying but similar timetables\".\nAmong those affected include many experienced soldiers who've been commissioned as officers after rising through the ranks.\nOne said:  \"Joined at 16, given my adult life and had real aspirations to be a lifer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but I feel as though the aspirations I had have been taken away from me by this policy, it feels like a punishment\".\nHe said that several of his cohort were also now considering leaving the Army.\nSeveral officers and their wives said the new accommodation policy would also have a devastating impact on family life, with grown-up children now no longer being able to return to a place to call home.\nOne officer said: \"I have a boy and girl just over the age of 18. Knowing I'd be allocated a three-bedroom house meant we could still get a family home. This policy changes it.\"\nThe wife of another officer said the policy would make life harder as they had children with special needs and needed the extra space - with parents often visiting to help out.\nIn a statement the MoD said the NAO \"will make provision fairer through allocating accommodation on need, not just rank and recognising long-term relationships\".\nThe MoD said the new rules will also allow soldiers to access the private rental market as an alternative, but in practice any private landlord would have to agree to strict MoD terms of ending a lease at short notice. It also said there will be a three-year transition period and during that period no-one will be left worse off.\nBut the underlying problem is a shortage of adequate military accommodation and there has been growing dissatisfaction with the state of military housing.\nMrs Bucknall said the MoD's decision to commit to meeting a big increase in demand, without making changes to the supply of homes, was \"madness\".\nAn MoD survey last year found fewer than half of personnel were satisfied with the overall standard of accommodation. More than a quarter said it was a factor influencing decisions to leave.\nSome families have been living in damp and poorly maintained military quarters.\nFor many this latest policy is the final straw. Another officer wrote: \"The negative impact on our family is too much now, and sadly this is going to push us to look at leaving the military.\"",
    "A furniture salesman who impersonated three friends in order to take driving theory tests on their behalf has been jailed for six months.\nAsif Saber, 35, travelled from his home in Birmingham to South Yorkshire to sit exams at test centres in Sheffield and Doncaster.\nSheffield Crown Court heard he charged \u00c2\u00a3100 per test, but was caught when a member of staff recognised his name.\nJudge Rachael Harrison said his actions showed \"complete contempt for the law\".\nProsecutor Danielle Gilmour said Saber tried to take three theory tests while \"purporting to be different individuals\", using their provisional licences to gain access to the exam.\nShe said he had taken one exam in Doncaster in March 2022, but when he returned in October of the same year he was challenged by a member of staff who suspected he may be impersonating someone else.\nThe court heard Saber was asked to provide another form of ID but left the centre and did not return.\nThe following year, in May, Saber went to the test centre in Sheffield where a member of staff recognised him as a \"person of interest\" and called the police.\nMs Gilmour said Saber had admitted the attempted fraud during interview.\n'Dangerous drivers'\nMark Bates, defending, said Saber had been having \"financial issues\" at the time of the offences, following the breakdown of his relationship, and was paid \u00c2\u00a3100 each time.\nPassing sentence, the judge said: \"What you attempted to do was put people who were not fit to be driving on the roads of this country on the roads of this country.\n\"That means potentially dangerous drivers who have been enabled to drive committing yet more criminal offences.\n\"To try to do it once would be bad enough but to do so on three occasions shows your complete contempt for the law in this country\"\nAccording to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), 186 people have been prosecuted for driving test theory fraud in the UK since 2018.\nA spokesperson said DVSA staff worked with examiners and test centre staff across the country to identify candidates suspected of cheating.\nAnyone caught could have their driving licence revoked, they added.\nSaber, of Bromford Lane, Birmingham, was sentenced after pleading guilty to three counts of fraud by false representation.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Hollywood director Gareth Edwards has always done things differently. Now his latest film has all the tech heads in Tinseltown talking.\nBest known for blockbusters such as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) and Godzilla (2014), and now rumoured to be helming the next Jurassic Park movie , his sci-fi action film The Creator is in the running for best special effects and best sound at the Oscars next month.\nThe film sees John David Washington play Joshua, an ex-special forces agent, as a future war rages between humans and artificial intelligence (AI). The movie also stars Gemma Chan and Alison Janney.\nSpeaking to BBC Click's Spencer Kelly, Edwards says: \"I used to jokingly refer to the style of the film [as] if Terrence Malik had sex with James Cameron and had a baby... that was the ultimate high benchmark of what this film was trying to do!\"\nIts impressive visuals - check out that huge military spaceship called The Nomad - have been widely praised, especially given the film had a budget of around $80m (\u00c2\u00a363m), a third of what a special effects-heavy movie like this would usually cost.\nWorking with pioneering studio Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), which was founded in 1975 in order to create the visual effects for Star Wars, British-born Edwards took inspiration from his first film Monsters (2010), an indy made on a tiny budget with a small team.\nMost big films meticulously plan and build elaborate sets before shooting the majority of their special effects against a blue/green screen, which is hugely expensive.\nBut Edwards switched things up, shooting on location in countries including Cambodia and Thailand, then adding the special effects later.\nReferencing Monsters, which had a crew of just six and also shot on location, Edwards says: \"[I was] trying to get back to the positives of doing a guerrilla film.\n\"It's a way more efficient, exciting and interesting process. If you go to a location that's like the place in the scene and... if the crew is small enough, it's cheaper to fly anywhere in the world than it is to build a set.\n\"Whatever was the best place in the world we could find for that scene, we would go and shoot it there, knowing that in the computer afterwards, we can change things.\n\"And [it] already looks good before you hand it over to the visual effects company.\"\nWorking that way has been made easier with recent advances in technology, Edwards explains.\n\"We tried to keep everything small and what allowed for that, which couldn't have happened five years ago, was that the camera technology had become really good.\"\nA Sony FX3 camera was the tool of choice: \"It's very cheap and small, I could just move with the camera. It was a massive, liberating thing.\"\nThe careful choice of locations also helped keep the budget down.\n\"It looks bigger than your average film because every location is an Instagram destination,\" Edwards tells Kelly.\nA significant chunk of The Creator was filmed in Thailand because \"money goes a lot further there\".\nBut creating a film in this way requires a lot of trust on behalf of the visual effects company, who come in at the tail-end of the project.\nEdwards explains that he showed the early stages of the scenes to ILM so any misunderstandings could be ironed out quickly.\nShooting on location was also an advantage for the cast.\nLondoner Andrew Roberts was the on-set special effects supervisor for the film.\n\"It's great to have something real for the visual effects artists to build on top of, and also for the actors to be in a space where there is something real that can inform their emotion and their performances, rather than being surrounded by blue or green [screen] and being told to imagine.\"\nThe film has received much praise for its special effects, although some critics have not been quite as impressed with the storytelling itself.\nThe Guardian's Wendy Ide awarded it four stars, writing: \"British director Gareth Edwards finally gets to make the sci-fi spectacular he was always destined to tackle.\n\"And with this ambitious, ideas-driven, expectation-subverting, man-versus-machines showdown, he has co-written and directed one of the finest original science fiction films of recent years.\"\nBut the Evening Standard's Hannah Strong had reservations, awarding it just two stars: \"It's a handsome film and demonstrates the filmmakers' vivid imagination, but this doesn't quite extend to the story itself, or its dialogue which often veers into cheesy territory.\"\nFor Edwards, the film posed a different challenge to the likes of Rogue One, his last movie which came out eight years ago.\nReports claimed that Lucasfilm left Edwards out in the cold towards the end of the project, bringing in Tony Gilroy to write new dialogue and shoot extra scenes.\nEdwards has disputed this, however , telling KRCW's The Business podcast that when Gilroy was brought in, they both worked together until the very end of the movie.\n\"Having done these massive franchises, there's pros and cons,\" Edwards tells BBC Cl",
    "A 54-year-old man from north Wales has been found dead on his boat during an attempt to row across the Atlantic Ocean.\nMichael Holt from Porthmadog, Gwynedd, left Gran Canaria on 27 January with the goal to reach Barbados in the Caribbean and help two charities.\nBut some 700 miles in, Mr Holt, who had type 1 diabetes, fell ill.\nHe was later found dead in his cabin by the crew of a fishing vessel that had sailed to his aid.\nMichael's death was announced in a statement made by his brother David Holt on Facebook.\n\"We have been working tirelessly to get help to Michael over the past four days but have found it incredibly difficult to do so,\" his brother wrote.\n\"Last night the fishing vessel Noruego accepted a tasking from Cape Verde Joint Rescue Coordination Centre and made directly for Michael's coordinates.\n\"Very sadly, upon arrival, Michael was found dead inside his cabin.\"\nThe statement went on to say: \"Of course this was not the ultimate conclusion we were looking for, but I am somewhat comforted knowing he died doing something he absolutely wanted to do with a passion and managed to row in excess of 700 miles in the process. An achievement in itself.\"\nThe statement said it was a \"huge shock\" to the family, and his brother thanked people for their messages of support, saying \"they mean a great deal to all the family\".\nBefore beginning his voyage Mr Holt said he expected it to take \"between 50-110 days\".\nHe anticipated having to row for over 16 hours a day and living off just four hours of sleep.\nHe was travelling alone on his ship, named Mynadd, and he had no helicopter or boat helping him, but he was in contact with a company that was tracking his progress.\nRelatives had expressed concern about him over the last week, initially saying he was suffering with seasickness, which he himself suspected was a \"bad reaction to taking some antibiotics\".\nHe therefore decided to postpone his journey to Barbados and begin rowing 300 miles south to the island Cape Verde.\nHowever, in the following days concerns grew after all efforts to communicate with him failed.\nIt was then on Sunday evening that his death was announced online.\nAs part of his challenge, he was raising money for the charity Mind and Liverpool Charity and Voluntary Services.\nHis brother David described how he had tried to prepare himself for \"horrible news\", but added it had still come as a shock.\n\"I phoned up the Cape Verde port authority to find out what the fishing boat had found,\" he said.\n\"Obviously there was a bit of a language barrier with them speaking Portuguese but I asked, have they seen Michael, is he ok? Is he alive? And they just came back with, no no no.\n\"I had prepared myself for that news to some extent given the lack of communication with him in the days before that, but it was obviously still a shock. It was horrible news.\"\nHe added he was \"incredibly proud\" of his brother.\n\"Despite what's happened, to be rowing on the open sea for 24 days and to cover over 700 miles is amazing,\" he said.\n\"There's probably a reason nobody with type 1 diabetes has ever rowed across the Atlantic ocean. But when Michael gets an idea in his head, that's it. What he's achieved is amazing.\"",

    "The US is taking legal action to block the merger of two major grocery chains, warning it would lead to higher prices.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a number of US states, said Kroger's planned $24.6bn purchase of rival Albertsons would eliminate important competition \"exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today\".\nThe two firms vowed to defend the deal.\nThe court battle comes as rising prices remain a key political issue.\nUS food prices have risen by 25% over the last four years and US President Joe Biden has been under pressure to show that his administration is taking action to address the problem.\nKroger, operator of brands such as Harris Teeter and Fred Meyer, is one of the biggest grocers in the US by sales.\nIt announced plans to purchase Albertsons Companies in October 2022, saying it would put it in a better position to compete with the likes of Walmart and Amazon.\nThe tie-up would create a firm with about 5,000 stores across 48 states, employing about 700,000 people and serving an estimated 85 million households.\nHowever, critics of the deal urged regulators to block it, saying Americans have suffered as the grocery industry has become increasingly dominated by a smaller number of big players.\nIn its announcement on Monday, the FTC said the deal would result in store closures, job losses and fewer choices for buyers, as well as higher prices. It has filed a lawsuit to stop the deal.\nStacy Mitchell, co-executive director of the anti-monopoly watchdog, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, cheered the move to block the merger.\n\"This decision shows that the FTC understands how the outsized power of big retailers is damaging the entire food system,\" she said.\n\"There was no upside to this merger for anybody other than the top executives at these two companies and their investors.\"\nKroger had proposed selling more than 400 stores to address monopoly concerns -a collection of sitesthe FTC criticised as a \"hodgepodge\" that did not adequately address concerns.\nThe two firms have denied there were any plans for store closures or job cuts and said they planned to invest in lower prices.\nAfter the FTC's announcement, Kroger said blocking the merger would lead to higher prices and fewer stores, while strengthening rivals who, unlike Kroger and Albertsons, do not employ staff who belong to a labour union.\n\"Contrary to the FTC's statements, blocking Kroger's merger with Albertsons Companies will actually harm the very people the FTC purports to serve: America's consumers and workers,\" Kroger said in a statement. \"The merging parties look forward to litigating this action in court.\"\nThe FTC during Mr Biden's presidency has taken a sceptical view toward mergers, suing to block deals in a range of industries including tech, health care and airlines.\nIts stance has drawn criticism of over-reach, while its record has been mixed. Though some firms have abandoned deals after being challenged, the FTC has also lost some high profile court battles.",
    "Hull City Council is inviting nominations for the 2024 Amy Johnson Cup for Courage after a 12-year hiatus.\nNominees must be 17 or under, have been born in Hull and have to have committed a \"signal act of courage\" in the previous year while living in the city.\nThe Cup for Courage was first awarded in 1931, arising from the famous local aviator's solo flight to Australia.\nMidge Gillies, Miss Johnson's biographer, said: \"A part of [Amy Johnson] would always be a Hull girl.\"\nThe last award-winner was Keleighsha Thorpe in 2012, who was 10 when she saved her grandmother's life after their home in Clarendon Street was targeted by arsonists.\nShe had woken in the night and smelt smoke, then woke her grandmother in time for them both to escape the burning building.\nHer name was entered in the city's roll of honour at the Guildhall as a result.\nAlison Henderson, of Hull City Hall, explained that the 12-year break since 2012 - the longest ever without the trophy being awarded - had happened because the responsibility for organising it had fallen through the cracks after staff changes.\nThe award originated shortly after Amy Johnson made her record-breaking solo flight to Australia in 1930, in her Gipsy Moth biplane called Jason.\nOne of the many gifts she received after her arrival down under was gold bullion worth \u00c2\u00a325, the money for which had been collected and presented to her by the children of Sydney, New South Wales, as a gesture of appreciation.\nOn her return to Hull she donated the sum to the city corporation, as it was then, along with a trophy.\nA deed was drawn up establishing the Cup for Courage to be awarded annually. The deed stated that Miss Johnson intended it to establish \"some connection between the children of Australia and the children of England\".\nMs Gillies, author of Johnson's 2003 biography Queen of the Air, said: \"The Cup for Courage is harder to award than you would imagine.\n\"You have to go through the schools, police and fire service to find a suitable candidate. There have been many years when it wasn't awarded at all because it wasn't possible to find anyone.\n\"Amy said at the time that she thought of it as being not just for physical courage but for moral courage too.\"\n'Moral courage'\nAccording to city council documents, the terms of the 93-year-old trust \"indicate that it was Miss Johnson's wish not to encourage any foolhardy acts by young people but... to foster and encourage those acts which occur from time to time in respect of rendering assistance to others and saving others from injury\".\n\"The idea of courage is so interesting,\" said Ms Gillies. \"These days women have the chance to be physically courageous, more so than in Amy's time.\n\"But on the other hand we all have to stand up and be counted. Moral courage might be something like standing up to prejudice.\"\nMs Gillies said that Amy Johnson was already an inspiration to young people after her Australia trip. \"She used to get all sorts of letters and the envelopes would say things like 'For Amy who lives in Hull'. But they still got there.\n\"She looked like a young girl, you see. But then with the flying she did something that was so physical. And then she became a motor mechanic as well because if you're going to fly a biplane all the way to Australia on your own you have to be,\" she said.\n\"I think she felt a heavy responsibility to continue to inspire young people,\" said Ms Gillies.\n'A Hull girl'\n\"Amy was very fond of Hull and very loyal to Hull. But she didn't have a Hull accent in the recordings of her, which bemused her friends. She sounded like Joyce Grenfell because she lost her accent when she went to London.\"\nAmy Johnson died in 1941 in circumstances that have provoked a lot of speculation over the years. But she has been immortalised in popular culture, including as a character in a Doctor Who story .\n\"Something else tragic about her life was that she lost a younger sister to suicide, so Hull had painful memories for her,\" said Ms Gillies. \"But a part of her would always be a Hull girl.\"\nNominations for the 2024 Amy Johnson Cup for Courage should be sent to Hull City Council by 29 February.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) , and Instagram .

The council is also looking to fill four director posts.\nIt is understood the council's monitoring officer - fulfilling a key legal role - has recently decided to leave.\nThe government has also asked inspectors to look at \"the use of resources for elections and the maintenance of the independence of the Returning Officer, and the arrangements to bring services such as Tower Hamlets Homes and leisure services in house\".\nIt was a Best Value review carried out in 2014 that led to government-appointed commissioners being sent in to run Tower hamlets a decade ago.\nCouncils have Best Value reviews to ensure they are delivering an economic, efficient, and effective service as well as continually improving.\nIn a letter to Mr Bromley-Derry, a DLUHC official said they were \"concerned\" with the authority's ability to comply with its \"Best Value Duty\".\nIt says DLUHC Secretary Michael Gove wants assurance that Tower Hamlets is \"continuing to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which its functions are exercised, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness\".\nThe letter says there is a danger of \"replicating\" the circumstances that led to Mr Rahman being banned from office for five years.\nIt adds the appointment of a handful of advisers to Mr Rahman creates \"the risk of a 'dual Council', side-lining officers of the authority in decision-making which, in turn, risks replicating the circumstances in which decisions were made up to 2014 that were corrupt and/or failed in the authority's Best Value Duty\".\nResponding to the news, Tower Hamlets Labour councillor Marc Francis said: \"It is no surprise to us as opposition councillors to see that civil servants have seen enough of the rapidly deteriorating governance and wasteful spending at Tower Hamlets Council under mayor Lutfur Rahman and his Aspire Party councillors and ordered this best value inspection.\n\"We have been warning about this situation for more than a year, including by debating the woeful 'action plan' put forward following stinging criticism by the recent LGA (Local Government Association) Peer Review.\n\"Instead of accepting those recommendations, the mayor and Aspire councillors have made it clear they haven't changed their ways.\"\nThe mayor said in a statement that he was confident in the outcome of the inspection.\n\"I am of course disappointed with the government's decision to inspect our council,\" Mr Rahman said.\n\"We will co-operate fully with the process. I am confident that the outcome will be positive and that we will give the government the assurance it requests.\n\"Personally, I remain focused on our residents first and foremost. Tower Hamlets is one of London's poorest and most overcrowded boroughs, and our residents deserve our continued dedication and service.\"\nA spokesperson for Tower Hamlets Council said: \"We are surprised by the decision, however it is of course the prerogative of the government and we are confident in our work and will co-operate fully.\n\"Our work has been praised in recent independent reviews by the Local Government Association Peer Review and Investors in People. Although both reviews were positive, we are already delivering action plans to fulfil their recommendations for further improvement as is the culture in our council.\n\"In recent months, the council has also made significant progress in resolving historic financial issues of audit, assurance and governance going back to 2016.\n\"All of this at a time when Tower Hamlets has delivered innovative measures to improve more lives, such as being the only local authority to provide free school meals for all primary and secondary schools - an achievement recognised with an award by a cross-party parliamentary group only last ",

    "Mitch McConnell, the US Senate's longest-serving Republican leader, has announced he is stepping down from his leadership position in November.\nThe Kentucky politician said it was \"time to move on\" in his address to the Senate on Wednesday.\nMr McConnell has proven key to passing conservative priorities and electing Republicans to Capitol Hill.\nBut he has fallen out with Donald Trump in recent years and feuded with him over his election falsehoods.\nMr McConnell, 82, has suffered several health scares in the past year though his staff say that has nothing to do with his decision. He twice froze when speaking during press conferences in the past year, and he suffered a concussion after falling at a hotel in Washington.\nThe Kentucky senator said in his speech that he would serve out his term, which ends in January 2027, but he would work \"from a different seat in the chamber\".\n\"I still have enough gas in my tank to thoroughly disappoint my critics,\" he said.\nOver his long career, Mitch McConnell proved himself to be one of the most effective Republican leaders in the Senate in part because he could alternate between bare-knuckle political hardball and a willingness to compromise when he saw fit.\nIn his speech, Mr McConnell reflected on his decades in the Senate, his age, and his family.\nBut he dedicated a large portion of his speech to the importance of US global leadership despite the ideological shift his party has undergone under former President Donald Trump's isolationist and populist rhetoric.\n\"I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time. I have many faults, but misunderstanding politics is not one,\" he said.\n\"That said, I believe more strongly than ever that America's global leadership is essential to preserving the shining city on a hill that Ronald Reagan discussed,\" he added, referring to the Republican president who proactively fostered US alliances at the end of the Cold War.\nMr Trump's leadership has changed those views among many Republicans.\nThe former president has pushed the party further to the right, and he has regularly questioned the value of American military alliances and international trade.\nHe has also repeated false claims that he won the 2020 election - a point of contention between him and Mr McConnell - and emphasised his desire to crackdown on immigration.\nThe Kentucky senator's willingness to compromise on some of those issues, his support of foreign military aid, and his rejection of Mr Trump's falsehoods made him a villain for many on the right, who at conservative gatherings would regularly jeer at the mention of his name.\nThis also led to Mr McConnell's ongoing feud with Mr Trump - on political strategy and on personal comportment - culminating in a definitive break between the two after the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.\nDuring Mr Biden's term, the political shifts in the Republican Party have caused Mr McConnell to face increasing pressures from his Republican colleagues in the Senate who have remained loyal to the former president.\nMr McConnell remains the last member of the congressional Republican leadership not to endorse Mr Trump's re-election bid, although there were recent reports that a reconciliation was being brokered.\nHis Wednesday's announcement may put an end to those discussions. It may also be viewed as a decision by the veteran politician that mending fences with the man who frequently belittled him was a step too far.\nBut the Senate minority leader did not suggest his party's ideological changes or Mr Trump were the reasons for his decision to leave the leadership post, nor did he give any other motivating factor beyond a passing reference to the death of his wife's sister.\n\"To serve Kentucky has been the honour of my life, and to lead my Republican colleagues has been the highest privilege,\" he said. \"But one of life's most under appreciated talents is to know when it's time to move on to life's next chapter.\"\nPresident Joe Biden, meanwhile,  told reporters that he had maintained \"a great relationship\" with Mr McConnell, though they often \"fight like hell\".\n\"I'm sorry to hear he's stepping down,\" he added.\nIt is uncertain who might next lead Senate Republicans, but there are three successors commonly mentioned in Washington: John Cornyn of Texas, John Barrasso of Wyoming and Mr McConnell's second-in-command - John Thune of South Dakota.",
    "The death of teenager Nex Benedict a day after a fight in an Oklahoma school toilet has drawn national attention as vigils take place around the US.\nA police investigation into the death of the 16-year-old, who was non-binary and used they/them pronouns, continues.\nThe cause of death is yet to be officially determined and exactly what happened in the bathroom remains unclear.\nHere is what we know at this stage.\nWhat happened at the school?\nNex Benedict was involved in what authorities called a \"physical altercation\" in a toilet at Owasso High School on 7 February.\nThis was broken up by other students who were present, aided by a member of school staff, police and the school said. The school said the students were in the bathroom for less than two minutes.\nSecurity footage showed Benedict was able to walk around the building after the fight. The school decided no ambulance was needed, officials said, but its nurse recommended that Benedict undergo further medical checks \"out of an abundance of caution\".\nBenedict's mother, Sue, called police to the hospital that same day and expressed frustration that the school had not alerted officers to the incident.\nIn bodycam footage released by police of that interaction at the hospital, Nex Benedict is seen awake and alert, reclining on a bed with arms folded and giving an account of what happened.\nThe student said three girls had picked on them and their group \"because of the way that we dress\".\nThe mockery is said to have continued in the toilet - with the attackers allegedly asking \"why do they laugh like that?\". Benedict responded by throwing water on the girls, according to the account provided to police.\n\"All three of them came at me\" afterwards, the teenager recalled. A fight ensued and Benedict said they were beaten on the ground before they \"blacked out\".\nThe school district said the death of a student was \"devastating\", and said it was committed to a \"safe and inclusive environment for all students\".\nIt said it was co-operating with the investigation amid \"speculation and misinformation surrounding the case\".\nHow did Benedict die?\nThis remains unclear. The police statement said medics were sent to \"a medical emergency\" at Benedict's home the day after the fight, on 8 February.\nIn an emergency call - the audio of which was also released by police - Sue Benedict said her child's breathing was shallow and their eyes were rolling back.\n\"I hope this ain't from her head,\" she said. \"They were supposed to have checked her out good.\" She later said in an online post that she had still been getting used to using Benedict's preferred they/them pronouns.\nParamedics performed CPR before rushing Benedict to hospital - where the teenager died.\nIn a statement released to NBC News , a lawyer representing the Benedict family drew attention to what they described as \"the devastating effects of bullying and school violence\".\nThey called the death a \"preventable tragedy\", adding: \"The Benedict Family calls on all school, local, state and national officials to join forces to determine why this happened, to hold those responsible to account and to ensure it never happens again.\"\nThe latest police statement says preliminary autopsy information indicates that the teenager \"did not die as a result of trauma\".\nOwasso police said they would not comment further until the results of toxicology and other test results were received. An official autopsy report has been promised at a later date.\nThe school has not confirmed if Benedict was bullied for their gender identity but said in a statement to ABC News that \"bullying in any form is unacceptable\".\nIt added: \"We take reports of bullying very seriously and have policies and procedures in place to address such behaviour.\"\nWhat has the reaction been?\nBenedict has been mourned around the country. Two vigils were held in Oklahoma on Friday night, with more than a dozen scheduled in cities across the US on Monday.\nAn online fundraiser that was launched to cover funeral costs has raised more than $150,000 (\u00c2\u00a3118,000). A message of thanks from Sue Benedict said she had not been expecting \"the love from everyone\".\nWhite House press secretary Karen Jean-Pierre called Benedict's death \"a tragedy\", adding: \"Every kid should feel safe and should feel protected when they go to school.\"\nAdvocacy group Freedom Oklahoma said the facts of the incident were still being established, but that members of the LGBT community had been receiving increased hostility \"fuelled by state law and the rhetoric around it, words and actions of our state elected officials\".\nCampaigners have criticised laws in Oklahoma which ban students from using school toilets and changing rooms that do not align with their sex at birth.\nRyan Walters, Oklahoma's public school superintendent, told the New York Times that Benedict's death was a tragedy, but restated his view of gender identity: \"There's not multiple genders. There's two. That's how God created us.\"\nCalls from the state to ",
    "A passenger who lost his dispute with Ryanair after being charged \u00c2\u00a3165 to check in at the airport has said he does not regret taking on the airline.\n\"I was so mad at the time, I had to try something. It ruined a couple of days of my holiday,\" dad-of-two Damian Lloyd, from Neath, told the BBC.\nRyanair said Mr Lloyd had \"unchecked\" his family and charged him to check in again, which he disputed.\nBut an independent ombudsman ruled in favour of the airline.\nAviationADR, an independent airline dispute resolution scheme, said that Ryanair had \"adhered to their own Terms and Conditions\".\n\"The airline has provided evidence that despite the passenger checking in online on 21st June, they also checked out on 22nd July. This is the reasons why the printed boarding passes were invalid and a new check in was required,\" it said in its ruling at the end of last year.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Lloyd said he did not regret going through the dispute resolution service, despite Ryanair being \"really rude\". He said the airline \"didn't want to know and that made me more angry\".\nAviationADR said the determination was not binding and that Mr Lloyd had the option to continue the complaint through the courts.\nBut the 50-year-old said: \"That's me forking out money for a case then, I'll just leave it.\"\n'Every excuse under the sun'\nHealth and safety manager Mr Lloyd had booked a 10-day family holiday to Gran Canaria in July.\nHe had checked in online but was left \"in total shock\" when his, his wife's and his daughter's boarding passes did not scan.\nA Ryanair employee at the check-in desk was equally confused, but as it was an early morning flight, they could not phone Ryanair's customer service to investigate the problem as it was not yet open.\nThe family was given a choice - either wait for customer service to open and miss their flights, or pay for new passes - which they did.\nMr Lloyd said he was told he could \"claim the money back,\" but when he requested a refund, Ryanair rejected the claim, before being told he had unchecked the day before his flight.\nAt the time, Mr Lloyd told the BBC: \"Ryanair came up with every excuse under the sun. I felt wronged.\n\"If they would have said sorry and offered me 10% off my next flight, I would have been happier.\"\nThe issue of airline fees was already in the spotlight last summer after an elderly couple were charged \u00c2\u00a3110 by Ryanair to print their tickets at the airport.\nThe couple told the BBC they had to pay airport check-in fees after mistakenly downloading their return tickets instead of their outgoing ones. Airport check-in fees were far more expensive than downloadable boarding passes.\nRegarding Mr Lloyd's case, Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: \"It's clearly unfair to charge customers \u00c2\u00a3165 to print out three pieces of paper for a genuine mistake. 'Gotcha' fees like this are part of the reason Ryanair is regularly rated one of the UK's worst airlines.\"\nRyanair did not respond to the BBC's request to comment.\nHave you taken on an airline over a dispute?

    "Migrant arrivals at the border have risen to record highs during President Joe Biden's administration, a massive political headache for him ahead of the election.\nPolls suggest that more than two-thirds of Americans disapprove of Mr Biden's handling of the issue.\nHis likely opponent in November's presidential election, Donald Trump, has repeatedly vowed to restore and expand the hard-line immigration policies of his first term. He has further promised to launch \"the largest domestic deportation operation\" in US history.\nBut it's not just Republicans who are unhappy about the influx. Democratic mayors in cities struggling to cope with the numbers are also making their feelings known.\nMore than 6.3 million migrants have been detained crossing into the US illegally under Biden, a higher number than under Trump, Obama or George W Bush.\nThe reasons for the spike are complex, with some factors pre-dating this government and beyond the control of the US.  We asked experts what's going on.\n1. Pent-up demand after lockdown\nThe number began to rise in 2018, largely driven by Central Americans fleeing a series of complex crises including gang violence, poverty, political repression and natural disasters. Detentions fell again in the summer of 2019, which US officials credited to increased enforcement by Mexico and Guatemala.\nThe most drastic reduction took place in early 2020, when pandemic-era restrictions led to a drastic reduction of over 53% between March and April that year.\nSince these measures were lifted in early 2021, the numbers have steadily risen, reaching an all-time high of just over 302,000 in December 2023.\n\"That's when we began to see an increase again, primarily of Central Americans after mobility restrictions [there] and across the region began to ease,\" said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a policy analyst at the Washington DC-headquartered Migration Policy Institute.\n\"That's also when the bigger change happened and we began to see much more diversified flows, starting with Venezuela, but also Colombia, Ecuador and places further away.\"\nIn January 2024, however, the figure plummeted about 50% to 124,220. Border officials attributed the dramatic drop to \"seasonal trends, as well as enhanced enforcement efforts\".\nMigrants now come from as far afield as West Africa, India and the Middle East.\nOf migrants from outside the Americas, the greatest increase comes from China. More than 37,000 Chinese nationals were detained at the US-Mexico border last year, about 50 times the figure from two years ago.\n2. Global migration trends\nThe increases in migrant figures seen at the US-Mexico border seen in the last several years also come at a time when, globally, migration to rich countries is at an all-time high.\nStatistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released late last year show that 6.1m new permanent migrants moved to its 38 member states in 2022 - a 26% increase over 2021 and 14% higher than in 2019.\nThe number of people granted asylum in the US doubled in 2022, driven in large part by migrants from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba. The US is second only to Germany now in levels of humanitarian migration.\n\"We are experiencing displacement around the world at a level never seen in recorded history, and people are turning up at our southern border for a variety of different reasons,\" explained Jorge Loweree, managing director of programmes at the American Immigration Council, a Washington-based non-profit and advocacy group.\n\"There are four failed states in our hemisphere alone.\"\nMore on the US border crisis\n3. From Trump to Biden\nThe switch in the White House in 2021 also contributed, say some experts.\nA key message from President Trump, even if it never became a reality, was the building of a border wall and increased deportations.\nThe headlines created by the separation of children from their detained parents, decried by many as cruel, added to the impression that the US was closing its border.\nUnder President Biden there was a change of tone and of policy. Deportations fell and \"deterrent-focused\" policies such as the rapid removal of migrants to Mexico and the building of a border wall ended.\nMigrants were paroled into the US to await immigration court dates - a process which can often take years.\nPeople trying to cross the border during this time told the BBC they thought that entering and staying in the US was going to be easier now. And human smugglers took advantage of a change in presidency to create a sense of urgency among migrants that they should hurry to the border.\n\"Part of it is that they think they can just come. I think that's just what they're being told,\" said Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio.\n\"They feel like there's a pathway to come here,\" he added. \"It's almost like an invite.\"\nConversely, some immigration activists have criticised the Biden administration and US lawmakers from both parties for failing to p",

    "Junior doctors in England are striking for the 10th time in their long-running pay dispute with the government.\nThe five-day walkout got under way at 07:00 GMT, with NHS bosses warning it will cause major disruption.\nHospital operations and check ups will be worst hit as half of doctors in hospitals are junior doctors.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) has asked for a 35% pay rise, but ministers have described the pay claim as unreasonable.\nHealth Secretary Victoria Atkins said she was disappointed junior doctors were continuing with strike action.\n\"No-one should underestimate the impact these strikes have on our NHS. So again, I urge the BMA to call off their strikes,\" she said.\nBut BMA junior doctor leaders Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi said: \"The government could have stopped these strikes by simply making a credible pay offer to begin reversing the pay cuts they have inflicted upon us for more than a decade.\"\nWhat do patients need to know?\nTwo-thirds of junior doctors are members of the BMA, although the much smaller Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association will also be taking part in strike action.\nRoutine hospital services are expected to face the most disruption because senior doctors are being drafted across to provide cover in emergency care.\nNHS England is advising patients in a life-threatening emergency to call 999 as usual, but for everything else to use 111.\nPatients who have routine appointments should attend as normal unless they have been told otherwise.\nThere is also expected to be some disruption to GP services.\nMatthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said it was a \"profoundly demoralising moment\" for the health service.\nHe told Sky News on Saturday: \"We know what the consequences of these strikes are\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 many appointments operations will have been cancelled, others will have to be cancelled, although I would say to people out there that if you have not been told that your appointment has been cancelled, then assume it will go ahead.\n\"I think what we would say to both sides is don't stand on ceremony - be imaginative. Maybe it's time for both sides to tell us what they would accept.\"\nWhat do patients think?\nThis walkout marks almost a year of strikes by junior doctors - the first was in mid-March last year.\nThe latest polling from YouGov shows support for junior doctors has fallen since last year, but a majority still support them, 50% compared to 43% opposing.\nNigel Hunt, 60, is one of the lucky patients in that he has not faced disruption so far.\nNigel was diagnosed with bowel cancer last year and his treatment is keeping his cancer at bay at the moment.\nHe says his chemotherapy has fallen on a strike day previously and not been cancelled.\n\"I find myself having to both support and not support the junior doctors,\" he said.\n\"I support them because they have been treated badly and they do deserve a decent pay rise.\"\nBut he says when they do strike he worries his treatment will be affected so as a patient he has concerns.\nToni Rush, 34, from West Yorkshire, is less sympathetic. She was due to have an operation on an anal fissure on Wednesday, but this has now been put back to mid-March.\nShe has been struggling with the problem for a year.\n\"To have waited so long and to have the operation cancelled just like that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it's annoying and frustrating - and I'm by no means in the worst position,\" she said.\nHow far apart are the two sides?\nJunior doctors received a pay rise averaging nearly 9% this financial year - and during talks at the end of last year, the option of an extra 3% on top of that was discussed.\nBut those talks ended in early December without a deal being reached.\nThe BMA is after 35% to make up for what it says is 15 years of below-inflation pay rises.\nThere have been no formal talks since those negotiations ended and the BMA is boycotting the pay review process for next year, refusing to provide evidence to the independent pay review body that makes recommendations on pay rises.\nInstead, the union is balloting members for a new six-month strike mandate.\nThis strike is the last one the BMA can hold under the current mandate as it expires at the end of the month.\nThe results of the ballot are expected in late March.\nJunior doctors in Wales also held a strike earlier this week , while in Northern Ireland they are planning to strike in early March .\nConsultants in England have taken part in walkouts as well, but no further action is planned as talks take place between the government and the BMA. A fresh pay offer was narrowly rejected by BMA members last month.\nAre you a doctor with a view on the strike? Or are you a patient affected?

    "Bristol International Balloon Fiesta is to be reduced from four days to three after rising costs meant \"something must give\".\nThe Ashton Court event has been a huge staple in the city's calendar for almost five decades.\nBen Hardy, executive director, said the change would save money and safeguard the future of the event.\n\"It helps us get a more sustainable model and keep it in Bristol for many years to come,\" he added.\nThis year's 46th balloon fiesta will take place from Friday, 9 August to Sunday, 11 August.\nIn recent years the free, not-for-profit event has been blighted by poor weather as well as the pandemic, inflation and other rising costs.\nIn a change to previous years, there will be a city-wide celebration in the build-up to the event with \"fiesta week\" seeing hot air balloons popping up in local communities.\nAn economic impact survey identified the event as Bristol's most valuable outdoor event - injecting \u00c2\u00a322.2m into the city's economy in 2023 alone.\nSome \u00c2\u00a314.7m of this was \"new expenditure\", organisers say, which without the event would not have been spent in Bristol.\nMr Hardy said costs in all sorts of businesses and the economy had increased and the event had also felt the impact.\nHe said pre-pandemic it cost \u00c2\u00a3750,000 to stage the event but it had risen to \u00c2\u00a31.1m. However, the team had since managed to bring it down to \u00c2\u00a3850,000.\n\"Just by moving it to three days we can save a little bit of money. It will solve some of the problem but not all of it,\" Mr Hardy said.\nHe added: \"We are looking at needing to find another \u00c2\u00a3100,000 to keep the balloon fiesta going. (Reducing by one day) saves about \u00c2\u00a330,000 - \u00c2\u00a340,000 so it's a significant saving.\n\"The whole event industry has seen a significant spike in costs post-pandemic. Those costs are starting to stabilise so we're hopeful for the future.\"\nThe shortened Balloon Fiesta will still include two Night Glow events, which will now take place on the Friday and Saturday evenings.\nOrganisers say a fleet of hot air balloons will pop up in local communities across the city in a series of local launches before the central arena at Ashton Court sets the stage for more than 100 hot air balloons to take flight, if weather conditions allow.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

    "Facebook and Instagram owner Meta says it will form a team to tackle deceptive artificial intelligence (AI) content in the upcoming EU elections in June.\nIt is concerned by how generative AI - tech which can fake videos, images and audio - might be used to trick voters.\nIt comes on the same day Home Secretary James Cleverly told the Times some people will use AI-generated fakes to try to influence a general election.\nBut an industry expert said the plans could be seen as \"lacking teeth\".\nThe BBC has asked Meta if it has such plans for upcoming UK and US elections.\nThe announcement comes two weeks after Meta signed an agreement with other big tech firms committing to fighting such content.\nThe European Parliament vote will be held from 6 to 9 June this year.\nSocial media rival TikTok announced in February it would be launching so-called \"Election Centres\" in local languages within its app for each of the 27 EU members, which will host authoritative information.\nMeta head of EU affairs Marco Pancini said in a blog post that the firm, which also owns WhatsApp and Threads, would launch \"an EU-specific Elections Operations Centre\" that would \"identify potential threats and put specific mitigations in place across our apps and technologies in real time\".\n\"Since 2016, we've invested more than $20bn (\u00c2\u00a315.7bn) into safety and security and quadrupled the size of our global team working in this area to around 40,000 people,\" he said.\n\"This includes 15,000 content reviewers who review content across Facebook, Instagram and Threads in more than 70 languages - including all 24 official EU languages.\"\nHe said this meant bringing together experts from a range of different teams across the company, including those working in engineering, data science and law.\n'Serious limitations'\nBut the announcement has shortcomings, according to Deepak Padmanabhan from Queen's University Belfast, who has co-authored a paper on elections and AI.\n\"Most of its planned strategy could be observed to lack teeth in substantive ways,\" he said.\nOne of the issues he has with Meta's strategy is how the firm plans to deal with AI-generated images, which he said \"could be intrinsically unworkable\".\nHe asked what would happen in a situation where realistic AI-generated images appear to show protesters clashing with police.\n\"Proving it to be fake requires that we are sure that there was no such attack by the policemen pictured on the farmers pictured - this may be infeasible both for technology or for human experts,\" he said.\n\"How can any technology label this as fake or real?\n\"Thus, it is not very clear as to how effective Meta's generative AI strategy could be - at the very least, there are serious limitations.\"\nMeta, which currently works with 26 fact-checking organisations across the EU, said it would bring on board three more partners based in Bulgaria, France and Slovakia to help deal with the threat.\nThe role of these organisations is not to deal with content which is intended to suppress voting - these kinds of posts are banned - but rather to debunk content that is spreading misinformation, including when they involve AI-generated elements.\nMr Pancini said these types of posts would be given warning labels and made less prominent, as well as not being allowed in ads.\nAds cannot question the legitimacy of the vote, prematurely claim victory, or question \"the methods and processes of election\".\nBut he said the firm's work was a result of collaboration, and it would require further co-ordination in the future.\n\"Since AI-generated content appears across the internet, we've also been working with other companies in our industry on common standards and guidelines,\" he said.\n\"This work is bigger than any one company and will require a huge effort across industry, government, and civil society.\"",
    "Ghana's parliament has passed a tough new bill that imposes a prison sentence of up to three years for anyone convicted of identifying as LGBTQ+.\nIt also imposes a maximum five-year jail term for forming or funding LGBTQ+ groups.\nLawmakers heckled down attempts to replace prison sentences with community service and counselling.\nIt is the latest sign of growing opposition to LGBTQ+ rights in the conservative West African nation.\nThe bill, which had the backing of Ghana's two major political parties, will come into effect only if President Nana Akufo-Addo signs it into law.\nHe previously said that he would do so if the majority of Ghanaians want him to.\nGay sex is already against the law in Ghana - it carries a three-year prison sentence.\nLast month Amnesty International warned that the bill \"poses significant threats to the fundamental rights and freedoms\" of LGBTQ+ people.\nActivists fear there will now be witch-hunts against members of the LGBTQ+ community and those who campaign for their rights, and say some will have to go into hiding.\nThis was echoed by the head of the UN body tackling Aids, Winnie Byanyima, who said: \"If Human Sexual rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill becomes a law, it will exacerbate fear and hatred, could incite violence against fellow Ghanaian citizens, and will negatively impact on free speech, freedom of movement and freedom of association.\"\nShe added that it would \"obstruct access to life-saving services\" and \"jeopardise Ghana's development success\".\nThe bill proposes a jail term of up to 10 years for anyone involved in LGBTQ+ advocacy campaigns aimed at children\nIt also encourages the public to report members of the LGBTQ+ community to authorities for \"necessary action\".\nMPs said the bill was drafted in response to the opening of Ghana's first LGBTQ+ community centre in the capital, Accra, in January 2021.\nPolice shut the centre following public protests, and pressure from religious bodies and traditional leaders in the largely Christian nation.\nAt the time, the Christian Council of Ghana and the Ghana Pentecostal and Charismatic Council said in a joint statement that being LGBTQ+ was \"alien to the Ghanaian culture and family value system and, as such, the citizens of this nation cannot accept it\".\nThe bill approved by lawmakers is a watered-down version of an earlier draft - for instance, jail terms have been shortened and a controversial clause on conversion therapy has been removed.\nDuring the days-long debate, the deputy parliamentary leader of the governing party, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, suggested further changes.\nHe said lawmakers should decide, via a secret ballot, whether people convicted of being members of the LGBTQ+ community should be imprisoned by the courts or ordered to do community service and undergo counselling.\nHowever, he was heckled into submission by lawmakers who supported prison sentences.\nYou may also be interested in:",

    "As the aviation industry gathers this week for the Singapore Airshow there is no shortage of military hardware made by US aerospace giant Boeing.\nSpectators have been treated to displays by the F-15 fighter and Apache attack helicopter. However, conspicuously absent from the event are Boeing's commercial jets.\nInstead, attendees of Asia's biggest airshow have to make do with models of Boeing's passenger planes or can step inside an \"immersive display\" of the Boeing 777X cabin.\nAnd as the event was in full-swing, Boeing announced that the leader of the troubled 737 Max programme Ed Clark would leave the company .\nIt's Boeing's first major aviation event since a cabin panel detached mid-flight from a brand new Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 in January.\nIn a preliminary investigation of the Alaska Airlines incident, US regulators found four critical bolts - meant to hold the so-called door plug in place - were missing. It led the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to order a temporary global grounding of the aircraft.\nThe planes are now flying again but the FAA said it will not yet allow Boeing to expand production of its best-selling narrow body family of jets, which includes the 737 Max 9.\nIn contrast, Boeing's arch-rival Airbus took to Singapore's skies with its A350-1000 passenger jet.\nIn its latest earnings report , the European aerospace giant said it would deliver 800 planes this year, including its A320neo which is a competitor to Boeing's 737 Max. Since the Alaska Airline incident, Boeing orders have shrunk significantly, delivering just 27 planes in January, compared to 67 in December.\nSafety first\nAfter the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) preliminary investigation into the the Alaska Airlines incident , Boeing's president Dave Calhoun said, \"whatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.\"\n\"There is no message or slogan to do that. It will take transparency and demonstrated action - that starts with each of us along with a commitment to listening to each other and speaking up,\" he added.\nAt the Singapore Airshow, Boeing marketing executive Dave Schulte said the plane was \"by far the most scrutinised\" and \"safest\" in the world, adding that he had flown on one with his family the previous week.\nSome of Boeing's biggest customers have voiced their frustrations with the company, with the boss of Emirates airline warning that Boeing is in the \"last chance saloon\" after a \"progressive decline\" in its performance.\nThis is not the first time Boeing has faced a safety crisis.  In 2018, the 737 Max 8 was grounded after two fatal crashes off the coast of Indonesia and over Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019. All together, 346 people were killed.  Those crashes were attributed to flaws in its flight control software, forcing both airplanes to make catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots.\nBoeing's biggest challenge is regaining the trust of both the buyers of its planes and those who fly on them, with editor of Asian Aviation magazine Matt Driskill saying it would be \"really hard\" for Boeing to earn back trust.\nHowever, a powerful voice in the industry says he is confident that Boeing will take the right measures and regain its status as a world-class supplier of aircraft.\n\"Boeing has responded in the right way. They have taken ownership of the problem. They put their hands up. They acknowledged that there is a problem that they need to address and I think they're going about that in the right way,\" Willie Walsh, the head of global airline industry body IATA told the BBC.\nChina rivalry?\nThe Singapore Airshow also saw the unveiling of another competitor for Boeing's airline customers - Chinese state-owned planemaker Comac.\nAt the event's press preview day, the Comac C919, a rival to Boeing's 737 Max and Airbus' A320neo single-aisle jet families, made its international debut.\nThe C919 started flying in China last year and the airline China Eastern placed an order for 100 of them, marking the largest order yet of the plane.\nHowever, some aviation analysts say it will not be a serious international contender for quite some time due to slow production and the need to gain regulatory approval to fly outside China.\nAnother concern is parts. The C919 may be made in China, but it relies heavily on international supply chains.\n\"The majority of the parts that go into the plane are from the West. The engines, the engine controls, the in-flight entertainment, just about every component is made in either Europe or America.\" Mr Driskill said.\nBoeing is also keen to emphasise the 737 Max's prominent position in the airline industry, highlighting that somewhere in the world one of the planes takes off every 16 seconds.\nGreg Waldron, Asia Managing Editor of online aviation website FlightGlobal, points out that despite the latest safety problems Boeing remains hugely important to the global commercial aviation and defence industries.\n\"Not to mention that there's a feder",
    "On a hot summer day in June 2010, two Indian children upset with their parents for hitting them left home.\nThe siblings - 11-year-old Rakhi and seven-year-old Bablu - planned to go to their maternal grandparents who lived just a kilometre away. But a few wrong turns and they were lost.\nIt's taken them more than 13 years to find their way back - with a lot of help from a child rights activist - to their mother Neetu Kumari.\n\"I missed my mother every single day,\" Bablu who grew up in orphanages told me on the phone. \"I'm very happy now that I'm back with my family.\"\nVideo footage of their reunion at the end of December shows Neetu sobbing as she welcomes Bablu home, embracing him tightly and thanking god for \"giving me the joy of holding my son again\".\nBablu then hugs Rakhi, who had returned home two days earlier. Though the siblings had been in touch for a few years, they were meeting after more than a decade.\nThe separation\nBablu and Rakhi lived in the northern city of Agra with their parents Neetu Kumari and Santosh, who worked as daily-wage labourers.\nOn 16 June 2010, Neetu, who had been unable to find work that day, took out her frustration on Rakhi and hit her with metal tongs she used for cooking.\nRakhi and Bablu left home after their mother stepped out for an errand.\n\"My father would also hit me sometimes if I didn't study properly, so when Rakhi came to me and said let's go and live with grandma, I agreed,\" says Bablu.\nAfter they got lost, a rickshaw driver gave them a lift to the railway station.\nThere, the children boarded a train where they were spotted by a woman who worked with a children's charity.\nWhen the train reached Meerut, a city nearly 250km (155 miles) from their home, she handed them over to the police who took them to a government orphanage.\n\"We told them we wanted to go home, we tried to tell them about our parents, but the police or the orphanage officials did not look for our family,\" says Bablu.\nA year later, the siblings were separated too - Rakhi was moved to a shelter for girls run by an NGO near the Indian capital, Delhi. A couple of years later, Bablu was moved to another government orphanage in Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh state.\nThe siblings connect again\nWhenever any important officials, charity workers or journalists visited the orphanage, Bablu would tell them about Rakhi in the hope that he would be reunited with her.\nBut it was only in 2017 that this paid off - one of the new shelter caretakers decided to help him when he told her that his sister had been sent to an orphanage for older girls somewhere near Delhi.\n\"She called every single orphanage in Noida and Greater Noida (suburbs of Delhi), asking them if they had anyone called Rakhi and after a lot of effort, she found her,\" says Bablu.\n\"I want to tell the government that it's really cruel to separate siblings. Brothers and sisters should be put up in centres next to each other. It's not fair to separate them,\" he adds.\nOnce the siblings reconnected, they would often talk on the phone. But whenever the conversation veered towards finding their family, Rakhi was doubtful. \"Thirteen years is not a short time and I had little hope that we would be able to find mumma,\" she told me.\nBablu harboured no such doubts. \"I was really happy to find Rakhi and I also felt confident that now I would be able to find our mother too,\" he said.\nIn one of the places he stayed in, Bablu said, the caretakers and older boys would often hit him. He says he tried twice to run away, but then got scared and returned.\nRakhi, on the other hand, says the NGO where she grew up took good care of her. I ask her if she thinks her life would have turned out differently if she had remained at home.\n\"I believe whatever happens is always for the good and maybe I had a better life away from home,\" she says.\n\"I didn't belong to them but they still looked after me very well. No-one ever hit me and I was treated well. I went to a good school, I had access to good healthcare and all other facilities that come with being close to a big city,\" she adds.\nThe activist who reunited the family\nOn 20 December, Agra-based child rights activist Naresh Paras received a call from Bablu who now lives and has a job in Bengaluru.\n\"You've reunited many families, can you please help me find mine?\" Bablu asked him.\nMr Paras, who has been working with children since 2007, says this was not a simple case.\nThe siblings didn't remember their father's name and their government-issued Aadhaar cards had different names for him. They had no idea which state or district they'd come from and their orphanage record said they were from Bilaspur, a city in the central state of Chhattisgarh. Mr Paras's calls to orphanages and police in Bilaspur drew a blank.\nA breakthrough came when Bablu remembered seeing a dummy railway engine outside the station from where he had boarded the train.\n\"I knew it had to be Agra Cantonment station then,\" Mr Paras says.\nLooking through city police reco",

    "A former Australian politician \"sold out\" the country to a foreign spy network, the nation's intelligence chief has alleged in a speech.\nOutlining the activities of the group dubbed the \"A-Team\", Mike Burgess claimed the MP had offered it access to the then-prime minister's family.\nHe did not name the person or the country they worked with but said the plot had unfolded \"several years ago\".\nThe claim has rocked Canberra, with some calling for the MP to be unmasked.\nWhile delivering his annual threat assessment in the capital on Wednesday, the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio) chief said the now disbanded A-Team was an \"aggressive and experienced\" foreign intelligence network which had identified Australia as a \"priority target\".\n\"The spies pose as consultants, head-hunters, local government officials, academics and think tank researchers, claiming to be from fictional companies,\" he said.\nThey targeted an array of people - students, academics, politicians, businesspeople, law enforcement, public servants - offering to pay thousands of dollars for reports on topics including trade, politics, foreign policy, and defence, Mr Burgess said. Information on the Aukus defence pact - which Australia signed with the UK and US - was of particular interest, he added.\nBut the former Australian politician was the most notable individual the foreign ring had \"successfully cultivated and recruited\", he claimed, while offering no specific details on the years they were active.\n\"This politician sold out their country, party and former colleagues to advance the interests of the foreign regime,\" Mr Burgess said.\n\"At one point, the former politician even proposed bringing a prime minister's family member into the spies' orbit.\n\"Fortunately, that plot did not go ahead but other schemes did.\"\nAlex Turnbull - the son of Malcolm Turnbull, who was in power between 2015 and 2018 - on Thursday told news.com.au he had once fielded a \"brazen\" approach by suspected Chinese agents and could be the family member Mr Burgess was referring to.\nMr Burgess said the former politician in question is no longer working with the group, adding that Australian intelligence officials had disbanded its operations and helped \"unaware\" participants extract themselves.\n\"Several individuals should be grateful the espionage and foreign interference laws are not retrospective,\" Mr Burgess said, referring to tougher laws which passed the country's parliament in 2018.\nHis agency confronted the A-team directly late last year, and has now decided to blow their cover to warn Australians.\n\"Australians need to know that the threat is real. The threat is now. And the threat is deeper and broader than you might think,\" he said.\nMr Burgess has recently spoken of the danger posed to Australia by Chinese espionage, and last year he revealed his agency had broken up a \"hive\" of spies, which local media later identified as being Russian operatives.\nOn Thursday, the first person to be found guilty under Australia's foreign interference laws was also sentenced to prison for cultivating a relationship with a cabinet minister on behalf of the Chinese government.\nFormer treasurer and ex-ambassador to the US Joe Hockey was among those calling for the MP to be identified, on the basis that not doing so would \"besmirch\" all politicians.\n\"The former politician is a traitor... somehow they're allowed to walk off into the sunset without having their name or reputation revealed, and that is absurd,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\nKey government ministers have also expressed dismay over the allegations but backed Mr Burgess' decision not to identify the individual.\n\"He wouldn't have done it this way if he didn't think it was necessary to do it this way,\" Treasurer Jim Chalmers said.",

    "Police should get extra powers to tackle protests outside Parliament, the author of a government-commissioned review has urged.\nCrossbench peer Lord Walney said MPs needed protecting from \"intimidation\" that could influence how they vote.\nHis comments come after Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle cited the threat to politicians in his controversial handling of a debate on Gaza.\nIt has reignited the heightened debate in recent years over the safety of MPs.\nAsked about Lord Walney's recommendations, Home Secretary James Cleverly said he expected police to take action when protesters gathered outside MPs' homes with the aim of \"distorting\" how they voted.\nBut he added he did not think police needed \"significantly greater\" powers to tackle demonstrations outside Parliament.\nA vote on a ceasefire in Gaza during a SNP debate on Wednesday descended into chaos after Sir Lindsay broke with convention to allow MPs to vote on a Labour amendment.\nHe argued that letting MPs vote on a wider range of positions would protect them from threats to their safety, amid heightened scrutiny of their stance on the conflict.\nHowever, several Conservative MPs have questioned his decision to allow Labour's motion on safety grounds, arguing he was letting Parliament be intimidated by threats of violence.\nWriting in the Telegraph, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman accused Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who argued for the wider vote - of \"bowing to the mob\".\nSir Lindsay has apologised for his handling of the vote, but it has plunged his position into crisis, with the SNP reacting furiously and declaring no confidence in him on Thursday.\nMore than 60 Conservative and SNP MPs have signed a Commons motion saying they have no confidence in him.\nDefending his decision, the speaker said some of threats posed to MPs were \"absolutely frightening,\" but he did not give details of specific threats.\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Ms Braverman's comments about Labour were \"total nonsense\".

    "It's extremely rare and usually exists for just 142 billionths of a second.\nPositronium can generate huge amounts of energy. It can shed light on 'antimatter' which existed at the beginning of the Universe, and studying it could revolutionise physics, cancer treatment, and maybe even space travel.\nBut until now the elusive substance has been almost impossible to analyse because its atoms move around so much.\nNow scientists have a workaround - freezing it with lasers.\n\"Physicists are in love with positronium,\" said Dr Ruggero Caravita, who led the research at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern), near Geneva. \"It is the perfect atom to do experiments with antimatter.\"\n\"Now the entire field of study is unblocked.\"\nSo what exactly is positronium?\nIt is a so-called exotic atom consisting of both matter and antimatter - so very unusual stuff indeed.\nMatter is what the world around us is made from, including the stars, the planets and us.\nAntimatter is its opposite. It was created in equal amounts when the Universe was born but exists only fleetingly in nature now, with very little of it occurring naturally in the cosmos.\nDiscovering why there is now more matter in the Universe now than antimatter - and therefore why we exist - will take us a long way toward a new, more complete theory of how the Universe evolved, and positronium could be the key, according to Lisa Gloggler, a PhD student working on the project.\n''Positronium is such a simple system. It consists 50% of matter and 50% of antimatter,\"she said. \"We are hoping that if there is any difference between the two we can see it more easily than in more complex systems.\"\nOne of the first experiments frozen positronium could be used for is to see if its antimatter part follows Einstein's Theory of General Relativity in the same way as the matter part.\nThe diagram below shows why positronium is so unique.\nThe matter, which forms the world around us, consists of atoms, the simplest of which is hydrogen, which is the most plentiful element in the Universe. This is made up of a positively-charged proton and a negatively-charged electron.\nPositronium, on the other hand, consists of an electron and its antimatter equivalent, a positron.\nIt was first detected by scientists in the US in 1951. But it has been difficult to study because the atoms move around a lot because it is the lightest known atom.\nBut cooling it slows the atoms down, making it easier for scientists to study.\nUp until now the coldest temperatures for positronium in a vacuum has been around 100C. The Cern team has now brought that down to more than -100C, using a technique called laser cooling. It is a difficult and intricate process where laser light is shone at the atoms to stop them jiggling about so much. The research has been published in the scientific journal Physical Review Letters.\nFor it to become usable for research positronium has to be frozen yet further, to around -260C, but the laser approach has given researchers a way forward, according to Prof Michael Charlton, an expert in positronium at Swansea University, who was not involved in the current breakthrough.\n\"This is a very encouraging first step, he told BBC News. \"It is opening the door so you can see the light on the other side, beckoning you to a new era of positronium physics.\"\nAnd the Cern group is not alone in their quest for frozen positronium. A group from the KEK Slow Positron Facility in Tokyo are about to publish similar results.\nIt is turning out to be a scientific race, involving other groups around the world as well, because this esoteric substance potentially has  enormous practical benefits. When an electron and positron combine, they release huge amounts of energy.

    "Sir Lindsay Hoyle's decision to depart from convention during a debate on the Gaza conflict was \"very concerning\", Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said.\nThe Commons Speaker is facing pressure to quit, after chaotic scenes in Parliament and acrimonious debate.\nSir Lindsay has apologised for giving MPs a vote on a Labour amendment during an SNP debate on Gaza on Wednesday, but said it was to ensure MPs' safety.\nThe SNP are calling for a vote on Sir Lindsay's future.\nMr Sunak called Sir Lindsay's decision \"very concerning because the usual ways in which Parliament works were changed\".\n\"We should never let extremists intimidate us in to changing the way in which parliament works,\" Mr Sunak said.\n\"That is a very slippery slope and not the right way to go.\"\nBut the prime minister fell short of backing calls to replace Sir Lindsay as Speaker.\nThere is no formal way for MPs to oust the Speaker, but the withdrawal of support from the SNP, the third largest party at Westminster, makes his position significantly more precarious.\nBBC chief political correspondent Henry Zeffman said a Commons Speaker \"lives or dies by their reputation as a fair referee\", and with one in 10 MPs - almost all Conservative and SNP - signing the motion of no confidence, \"that's a very bad position for a Commons Speaker to find himself in\".\nIt comes after Sir Lindsay gave MPs a vote on a Labour amendment calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, during a debate allocated to the SNP on Wednesday.\nThe move meant Labour MPs could call for a ceasefire without backing a differently-worded motion from the SNP, side-stepping a potential Labour rebellion but provoking fury among the SNP's MPs.\nAfter the Conservatives then said they would not take part, the Labour motion was passed, meaning standalone votes on the SNP motion, as well as a government amendment, were dropped.\nSir Lindsay said he had allowed the vote to give MPs the chance to vote on a wider range of positions, and to protect them from threats to their safety.\nIt has plunged his tenure as Speaker into crisis, with accusations he played \"party politics\" with the vote.\nSeveral Conservative MPs have also questioned his decision to allow Labour's motion on safety grounds, arguing he had allowed Parliament to be intimidated by threats of violence.\nHe is expected to meet senior party figures later, as he battles to shore up support for his position.\nSir Lindsay apologised to the SNP for making a \"mistake\" - and offered the party another chance at a Gaza vote through a future emergency debate.\nIn an emotional statement in the Commons, he added: \"I have a duty of care, and I say that, and if my mistake is looking after [MPs] I am guilty.\"\nHe added that details of threats to MPs shared with him were \"absolutely frightening\".\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer rejected suggestions he had threatened to withdraw support from Sir Lindsay after the next election if he didn't allow a vote on Labour's motion.\nSpeaking to reporters, he said he did not \"threaten the Speaker in any way,\" but did not directly answer a question on whether any of his MPs might have done so.\nHe accused the SNP of only being interested in \"dividing the Labour Party\", and the government of walking out on the debate because it did not have support from Tory MPs for its own amendment.\nBut the Scottish nationalist Alba Party have asked the Commons Privileges Committee to investigate the allegations Sir Keir put \"unwarranted and unacceptable pressure\" on Sir Lindsay to select the Labour amendment.\n'Best of reasons'\nThe acrimony continued in Parliament on Thursday, with Commons leader Penny Mordaunt accusing Labour of playing politics with the vote.\n\"I would never have done to [Sir Lindsay] what the Labour Party have done to him,\" she added, to jeers from Labour MPs.\nUnlike some of her colleagues, it was noticeable she did not direct her criticism towards Sir Lindsay.\nOne of the Tory MPs calling for Sir Lindsay to go, Danny Kruger, accused him of allowing \"Labour to use the Islamist threat to change the way our democracy works\".\nAnother Tory MP, Sir Charles Walker, said Sir Lindsay had made a \"genuine mistake\" for the \"best of reasons,\" adding the Speaker was \"obsessed with the safety of MPs and their staff\".\n\"The idea that we remove a Speaker for trying to do the right thing is just too ghastly to contemplate,\" he added.\nSNP MP David Linden said he believed that Sir Lindsay he will be out of his position by \"the weekend\".\nSpeaking on Radio 4's PM programme, Mr Linden said: \"The reality is, the Speaker of the House of Commons was bounced into this by the Labour leadership.\"\nMr Linden added that the Speaker should now \"do the right thing and resign to allow us to get back to the issues that matter\".\nLiberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said the Speaker still has the \"full support\" of his party.\nSpeaking to GB News, Mr Davey said Sir Lindsay \"was in a very difficult position, to make sure all views were heard he approached that with a de",

    "A man whose daughter was murdered by her abusive ex-boyfriend a decade ago says teaching teenagers about coercive control is saving lives.\nHollie Gazzard, 20, was stabbed by Asher Maslin while working at a Gloucester hairdressing salon in 2014.\nThe trust set up in her name now runs workshops in schools to highlight what coercive behaviour and domestic abuse is and how to raise concerns.\nNick Gazzard said he was \"really proud\" of what the trust had achieved.\nHollie had ended a relationship with Maslin shortly before he stabbed her to death on 18 February, 2014. He was jailed for life for her murder.\nA service remembering her was held at Gloucester Cathedral on 20 February.\nThe Hollie Gazzard Trust was set up by her parents Nick and Mandy and sister Chloe in the wake of her death.\nThe family has campaigned to educate young people about domestic violence, and have told her story all over the world over the past 10 years.\nDawn Burke, principal of Newent Community School, said coercive control was something she did not feel \"we had explicitly taught before\".\n\"The actual nuances of what happened to Hollie - and how we can notice some of the behaviours and how we can change our behaviours to be more positive as a result of learning from her case - I cannot learn that,\" she said.\n\"I do not have experience of that.\n\"Having the trust who does that training for us, and brings all of that knowledge from that really serious consequence for us to learn from has been really, really important.\"\nNoah, 16, one of the year 11 pupils to take part in the workshop, said: \"The fact there is multiple forms of coercive control - it is not just how you hear and see it on the news - but it is more subtle details that can build up over time.\"\nSarah, also 16, said: \"Some people do not get their side heard and it can go unknown for quite a while, and people like Hollie end up losing their life over it.\"\nSara Dillon, training manager at the Hollie Gazzard Trust, said the organisation knew it was making a difference.\n\"When Nick started the trust, his intention was to try and save one person,\" she said.\n\"Hollie is always at the forefront of what we do, so it is not an easy role but it is a privilege to do it in her name.

    "Popular support for Israel in the US will help it fight \"until total victory\" over Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday.\nIn a statement, Mr Netanyahu cited polls showing that more than 80% of Americans support Israel during the conflict in Gaza.\nHis comments come after US President Joe Biden warned that Israel risks losing global support in the war.\nUS officials say they are working on a possible ceasefire deal.\nIn his statement on Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu said that, since the beginning of the conflict, he has been leading a campaign \"countering international pressure to end the war ahead of time and mobilise support for Israel.\"\n\"We have significant successes in this area,\" Mr Netanyahu added, citing a recent Harvard-Harris poll showing that 82% of the American public supports Israel. \"This gives us more strength to continue the campaign until complete victory.\"\nOn Monday, Mr Biden said the US hopes to have a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza \"by next Monday.\"\nThe US president also suggested later on that Israel could \"lose support from around the world\" if it \"keeps up with this incredibly conservative government they have\".\nAnother poll, from the Associated Press and Norc, found that about half of US adults in January believed Israel had \"gone too far\" - up from 40% in November.\nWhite House and State Department officials on Tuesday confirmed that negotiations on a temporary ceasefire were continuing, but declined to give details on the substance of the talks or potential timelines.\nJohn Kirby, the White House's National Security Council spokesperson, said that \"significant progress\" had been made towards a deal last week to allow hostages to leave Gaza and let humanitarian assistance in.\n\"We're building on that progress this week and the president and his team remain engaged around the clock with multiple partners in the region,\" Mr Kirby added.\n\"But as the president said just in the last 24 hours or so there's no deal as of yet. And there's a lot more work to do.\"\nThe ceasefire, Mr Kirby said, would \"hopefully\" allow for a six-week pause, significantly longer than previous pauses in the fight.\n\"Maybe that could lead to something more in terms of a better approach to end the conflict,\" he said.\nAt the State Department, spokesman Matthew Miller said that US diplomats - working with Qatar, Egypt and Israel - are \"trying to push this deal over the finish line\", but that \"ultimately, we would need Hamas to say yes.\"\nA Hamas official had earlier told BBC News the group's priorities were on ending hostilities, rather than the release of hostages.\nIsrael launched a large-scale air and ground offensive in Gaza after Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 253 hostages, some of whom have since been released.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip says at least 29,878 people have been killed in the territory since then - including 96 deaths in the past 24 hours - in addition to 70,215 who have been wounded.",

    "A tiny, transparent fish makes a sound as loud as a pneumatic drill, scientists in Berlin have discovered.\nThey were prompted to investigate after hearing mysterious clicking noises coming from the fish tanks in their lab.\nThey found that the fish, Danionella cerebrum, drums out a powerful rhythm on an organ called a swim bladder.\nIn the waters close to the fish, it taps out 140 decibels, which is as loud as a gunshot.\nResearchers believe the 12mm long species is the loudest fish for its size yet found.\nThey believe the drumming may be a form of social communication.\nIn most of nature's realms, the bigger the animal the louder the noise.\nUnder the water it's a different story - where the minuscule species is now one of the noisiest yet discovered.\nScientists have known that other creatures, such as the aptly named pistol shrimp can create very loud noises as they hunt other species, up to around 200 decibels.\nDanionella is valued by science as its transparency means you can see its brains in action and this allows researchers to closely study its behaviour,\nBut while working with these fish in their lab in Germany, the scientists noticed something odd.\n\"People were just walking past the fish tanks, and they could hear these sounds, and were wondering where they were coming from,\" said Verity Cook, the lead author of the study, and a PhD Student at Charit\u00c3\u00a9 University, Berlin.\n\"It turned out that they're coming from the fish themselves. And it's extraordinary, because they're so tiny and so loud.\"\nUsing an array of microphones and video cameras, the research team were soon able to work out just how loud.\n\"At a distance of one body length away, around 140 decibels is the amplitude of the sound, that's how loud we believe the sound to be perceived by other fish,\" she told BBC News.\n\"Sound attenuates with distance, so at one metre away, the amplitude is around 108 decibels.\"\nThat's still roughly equivalent to the noise made by a bulldozer.\nMuch of this sound is reflected back into the water so when humans stand beside the fish tanks, they hear these pulses as a continuous buzzing sound.\nWhile fish including the Plainfin Midshipman and the Black Drum and others are louder, they are all much larger than danionella.\n\"In terms of communication signals, I couldn't find another animal of this size that makes sounds this loud,\" Ms Cook added.\nThe researchers argue that the drumming mechanism that the fish use is a very sophisticated instrument.\nAll bony fish have a swim bladder, a gas-filled organ which helps them remain under the water.\nMany species use their muscles to drum on this bladder to produce sounds but danionella goes several steps further.\nWhen it contracts its muscles, these pull on a rib, which creates tension with a piece of cartilage that sits inside the muscle.\nWhen the cartilage is released it hits the swim bladder.\nOnly the males of the species make this sound, and they only do it in company. Some are louder than others.\n\"We know that when you have maybe like eight males together in a large tank, then three of them will dominate the sound production and the other ones will be quiet. So we think there is some sort of hierarchy,\" Ms Cook said.\nThe researchers believe that evolving in murky waters in Myanmar played a role in the development of this ability to make a big noise to help them communicate.\n\"Evolution has come up with lots of interesting ways to solve lots of interesting problems,\" said Ms Cook.\n\"And we shouldn't assume that we know how things work, just because of how things work in other species.\"\nThe study has been published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
    "The Scout Association could be investigated by police over whether it tried to pervert the course of justice after a teenager was killed on a hike.\nBen Leonard, 16, was among a group visiting Llandudno's Great Orme when he fell 200ft (60m) from cliffs.\nAn inquest jury found a leader and his assistant responsible for unlawful killing, and neglect by the Scout Association contributed.\nThe organisation said it denied any allegations of \"any criminal action\".\nBen, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, was planning to hike up Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon, during the trip in August 2018.\nHowever, due to the weather, the scout group were instead taken to Llandudno in Conwy county to walk up the Orme.\nBen and two other boys broke away from the main hike and took their own unsupervised route up the hillside - but he slipped off a narrow cliff edge and fell, suffering fatal head injuries .\nDuring the inquest into his death, assistant coroner David Pojur referred the Scouts and an employee - who cannot be named by court order - to police to investigate for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.\nNorth Wales Police confirmed on Thursday it was reviewing the details of the referral and was therefore unable to comment.\nBut jurors were not told of the police referral and the media were ordered not to report it until the jury reached their conclusions.\nLawyers for the Scouts and several other individuals applied to extend the reporting restriction indefinitely, but this was refused following an application by several media organisations including the BBC.\nThe conspiracy to pervert the course of justice referral relates to the first inquest into Ben's death, which took place in 2020 but was abandoned for unrelated legal reasons.\nThe Scouts said in a statement that it \"emphatically\" refuted any allegations made in court \"about any criminal action\" on its behalf.\nThe jury heard evidence that there had been no written risk assessment carried out for the summer camping trip to the Eryri national park.\nThere was also no on-the-day risk assessments carried out for the trip up the Great Orme, and no discussion about safety with the Explorer Scouts by their group leader Sean Glaister, or assistant leader Mary Carr.\nThe inquest was told that there was no Scout accredited first aider on the trip, after a senior leader failed to attend the event.\nIt led to questions in court about whether the trip should have been authorised in the first place.\nMr Glaister agreed The Scout Association never monitored his activities or ensured any training he was supposed to undergo had ever been done.\nBernard Richmond KC, representing Ben's family, asked Mr Glaister: \"They have hung you out to dry, haven't they?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Mr Glaister said. \"This could have happened to any of the leaders on any of the trips we went on.\"\nFollowing the hearing, Jennie Price, from the Scout Association's board of trustees, said: \"We take today's conclusion extremely seriously.\n\"We want to restate our wholehearted apology to Ben Leonard's family and our deepest sympathies continue to be with his family and friends.\"\nShe said that \"as an organisation we are committed to learning\" and that as a result of the death it has \"already made changes to our risk assessments, safety rules, training and support we give our volunteers\".\n\"We will closely review the coroner's observations and adopt all further changes we can, to do everything in our power to stop such a tragic event happening again,\" she added.\nOn the first day of this year's inquest, the Scouts apologised to Ben's family for failing in its duty of care and accepted responsibility for his death.\nOne police officer investigating the death told the inquest there had been \"grave failings\" and missed opportunities to prevent the tragedy.\n'No one can touch the Scouts'\nThe jury heard Ben's family were told, \"people who try and take on the Scouts are never successful\" and that \"no one can touch the Scouts\".\nIt also heard Ben's family were lied to as the Scout Association was worried about \"reputational damage\".\nJackie Leonard, Ben's mother, said her \"thoughtful, very funny, extremely witty\" boy can now be in peace after the family had \"lived in limbo for years\".\n\"We've been unable to move forward, with the strange feeling that somehow Ben has not been allowed to die until we finally get a death certificate,\" she said.\nShe said she \"never had any faith or trust\" in the Scouts, and felt the organisation \"relied\" on the family being na\u00c3\u00afve to the process.\nMrs Leonard added the organisation had tried to portray her son as a \"wild child\", taking a \"defensive\" attitude.\n\"This verdict must surely now mean they have to be regulated by an external body,\" she said.\nAdditional reporting by PA Media",

    "Medical providers and fertility patients in Alabama have been left in uncertainty after a court ruled that frozen embryos are considered children.\nAt least three fertility facilities have since paused new IVF treatments over concerns of \"legal risk\".\n\"There is an emotional side to this, and I don't think the law should be based on those emotions,\" one Alabama mother said.\nThe ruling opens up a new front in the US battle over reproductive medicine.\nIt is not yet clear what the impact might be in other parts of the country.\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruling, which came down on Friday, was prompted by three couples who filed a case after their embryos were accidentally destroyed in an incident in 2020.\nA patient wandered into the part of a fertility clinic where the embryos being stored, handled them, and accidentally dropped them.\nThe ruling did not ban or restrict IVF and in fact, the couples who brought the case actively sought out the procedure.\nBut experts say the decision may cause confusion about whether some aspects of IVF are legal under Alabama law - and over how to use and store embryos.\nPresident Joe Biden weighed in on Alabama's decision, saying it puts \"some fertility treatments at risk for families who are desperately trying to get pregnant\".\n\"The disregard for women's ability to make these decisions for themselves and their families is outrageous and unacceptable,\" he said in a statement. \"This is a direct result of the overturning of Roe v Wade.\"\nAlabama Fertility, the largest clinic in the state, announced in a Facebook post on Thursday its \"impossibly difficult decision to hold new IVF treatments due to the legal risk to our clinic and our embryologists\".\nIt said it was contacting affected patients \"to find solutions\", and would alert legislators \"as to the far reaching negative impact of this ruling on the women of Alabama\".\nAnother clinic, Mobile Infirmary, announced it would be pausing treatments as well, saying the court decision \"sadly left us with no choice\".\n\"We understand the burden this places on deserving families who want to bring babies into this world and who have no alternative options for conceiving,\" said Mark Nix, president and of Infirmary Health.\nIt comes after the southern US state's largest hospital stated on Wednesday its own decision to pause IVF services, over fears it could be exposed to criminal prosecution.\nDr Mamie McLean from Alabama Fertility told the BBC World Service Newshour programme that her patients would not be able to go through IVF in the near future.\nShe said the court ruling made it \"impossible\" for IVF treatments to happen in the state, adding that \"there will be fewer babies in Alabama because of this\". She pointed out that Alabama already had one of the lowest net population growths in the nation.\nDr McLean explained: \"If an embryo is considered a child, the legal ramifications are too far-reaching and scary. We cannot put our practice or our embryology team at the risk of significant legal penalty or even jail time. And unfortunately, our patients are bearing the burden of this misguided ruling.\"\nIVF patients are also concerned about the ruling's ramifications.\nVeronica Wehby-Upchurch, 42, told the BBC that she had her son - now three years old - via IVF and has two frozen embryos in the state.\nSince the ruling, though, she fears prosecution.\nBecause she already went through IVF before, she says that while she was \"appalled\" at the news, she was \"unfortunately, not shocked\", adding that \"those of us who have been paying attention sort of saw this coming\".\nMs Wehby-Upchurch says her desire is to have another child but she does not know now what her options are and, at 42, there's not a lot of time left.\n\"I understand the idea of attaching emotions to embryos,\" she said. \"But you can't cuddle an embryo, you can't breastfeed an embryo. It took me five embryos to get to my one child I hold in my arms.\"\nIVF - which stands for in-vitro fertilisation - offers a possible solution to women who face challenges getting pregnant. Officials say around 2% of US pregnancies are the result of this method.\nThe process involves retrieving the woman's eggs with a needle from her ovaries and combining them with a man's sperm in a lab. The fertilised embryo is then transferred into the woman's uterus, where it may create a pregnancy.",

    "The Bengal famine of 1943 killed more than three million people in eastern India. It was one of the worst losses of civilian life on the Allied side in World War Two.\nThere is no memorial, museum, or even a plaque, anywhere in the world to the people who died. However, a few survivors remain, and one man is determined to gather their stories before it is too late.\n'Hunger stalked us'\n\"Many people sold their boys and girls for a little rice. Many wives and young women ran off, hand-in-hand with men they knew or didn't know.\"\nBijoykrishna Tripathi is describing the desperate measures people took to find food during the Bengal famine.\nHe is not sure of his exact age, but his voter card says he is 112. Bijoykrishna is one of the last people to remember the disaster.\nHe talks faintly and slowly about growing up in Midnapore, a district in Bengal. Rice was the staple food, and he remembers its price rising \"by leaps and bounds\" in the summer of 1942.\nThen came the cyclone of October that year, which blew the roof of his house off and destroyed that year's rice crop. Rice soon became unaffordable for his family.\n\"Hunger stalked us. Hunger and epidemics. People of all ages began to die.\"\nBijoykrishna remembers some food relief, but says it was inadequate.\n\"Everyone had to live with half-empty stomachs,\" he says. \"Since there was nothing to eat, many people in the village died. People started looting, searching for food.\"\nListening to him on his veranda are four generations of his family. Also with them is Sailen Sarkar who, for the past few years, has been travelling around the Bengali countryside, gathering first-hand accounts from survivors of the devastating famine.\nThe 72-year-old is warm, has a youthful air, and smiles easily. You can see why people like Bijoykrishna open up to him. He travels around the countryside in his open-toed sandals, whatever the weather, with his backpack and a supply of roll-up cigarettes. He is old-school, taking down the testimonies with pen and paper.\nSailen says he first became \"obsessed\" by the Bengal famine because of a family photograph album. He would flick through it as a little boy in Calcutta (now Kolkata), staring at the photographs of emaciated people.\nThe pictures had been taken by his father, who had been involved with a local Indian charity, giving out relief during the famine. Sailen says his father was a poor man. \"In my childhood I saw the terror of starvation in his eyes,\" he says.\nHowever, it was not until 2013 when Sailen - now a retired teacher - started his quest. While walking in Midnapore, he fell into conversation about the famine with an 86-year-old man.\nSripaticharan Samanta, like Bijoykrishna, also remembered the devastating cyclone. Life was already getting harder by that point, and the price of rice had been increasing steadily.\nBy October 1942 he was eating one small meal of rice a day. Then the storm hit.\nSripaticharan remembered how the price of rice skyrocketed after the cyclone, and how traders bought up whatever was left at any price.\n\"Soon there was no rice in our village,\" he told Sailen. \"People lived off saved stocks for a while but started to sell off their lands just to have rice to eat.\"\nAfter the storm, his family's household rice reserves lasted for only a few days, then ran out.\nLike tens of thousands of others, Sripaticharan left the countryside for the city - in his case, Calcutta - in the hope of relief. He was lucky - he had a family member to stay with - and he survived. But many were not so fortunate, collapsing on roadsides, around dustbins, and dying on the pavements - strangers in a city they thought would help them.\nThree Million\nThe devastating story of the Bengal Famine of 1943 in British India, where at least three million people died, told for the first time by the eyewitnesses to it.\nListen now on BBC Sounds\nA forgotten fate\nThe causes of the famine are many and complex, and continue to be widely debated.\nIn 1942, rice supplies in Bengal were under intense pressure.\nBurma - which bordered Bengal - was invaded by Japan early in the year, and rice imports from that country stopped abruptly.\nBengal now found itself near the front line and Calcutta became host to hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers and workers in wartime industries, increasing the demand for rice. Wartime inflation was rife, putting the price of rice out of reach for millions who were already struggling.\nMeanwhile, British fears that the Japanese would attempt to invade east India prompted a \"denial\" policy - this involved confiscating surplus rice and boats from towns and villages in the Bengal Delta. The aim was to deny food supplies and transport to any advancing force, but it disrupted the already fragile local economy, and caused prices to rise further. Rice was hoarded for food security, but often for profit.\nTo cap it all, the devastating cyclone of October 1942 destroyed many rice crops, with crop disease ruining much of the rest.\nThere is a long",
    "Stand-up comedian and Curb Your Enthusiasm co-star Richard Lewis has died aged 76.\nHe died peacefully in his home in Los Angeles Tuesday night after suffering a heart attack, his publicist, Jeff Abraham, said in a statement.\nLewis announced last April that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and would retire from stand-up comedy.\nKnown for his self-deprecating humour, Lewis rose to prominence in the 1980s.\nFor years, the actor and writer starred alongside Larry David in his HBO show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, where he played a semi-fictionalized version of himself.\nHe had most recently appeared in Season 12 of the show, which is currently airing on HBO. The network said it was \"heartbroken\" to learn he had passed.\n\"His comedic brilliance, wit and talent were unmatched,\" a spokesperson told US outlets.\nIn a statement shared by Lewis' publicist, his wife, Joyce Lapinsky, said she \"thanks everyone for all the love, friendship and support and asks for privacy at this time\".\nHis co-star, Larry David, praised his friend in a statement HBO shared with US media.\n\"Richard and I were born three days apart in the same hospital and for most of my life he's been like a brother to me,\" he said. \"He had that rare combination of being the funniest person and also the sweetest. But today he made me sob and for that I'll never forgive him.\"\nBorn in Brooklyn and raised in New Jersey, Lewis made a name for himself in the 1970s performing in clubs in New York City and on late-night TV.\nNicknamed \"The Prince of Pain\", Lewis was known for poking fun at his own neuroses and hypochondria during his comedy routines. Dressed nearly always all in black, he once joked he was the \"Descartes of anxiety; I panic, therefore I am\".\nLewis was also open about his struggles with addiction and depression and had been sober for decades. His edgy act found favour among talk show hosts, and Lewis became a firm favourite of late-night legends David Letterman and Jay Leno.\nComedy Central had called him one of the top 50 stand-up comedians of all time and GQ Magazine included him in its list of the 20th Century's Most Influential Humourists.\nIn 1979, he made his acting debut in the NBC special Diary of a Young Comic. The film followed the satirical journey of a young comedian seeking to make it in Los Angeles.\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, he starred in a host of TV shows, including the sitcom Anything but Love, where he played opposite Jamie Lee Curtis from 1989 to 1992.\nBut it on Curb Your Enthusiasm where Lewis found his signature role. Premiering in 2000, his stint playing a fictionalised version of himself won plaudits.\nLewis had to take a break from starring in Season 11 of Curb Your Enthusiasm due to a series of surgeries.\n\"I've had sort of a rocky time,\" he said last year announcing the news of his diagnosis.\nHe added that he had undergone back surgery, shoulder surgery, shoulder replacement surgery and hip replacement surgery. \"I had four surgeries, back to back to back... It was bad luck, but it's life.\"\nNews of his death prompted a stream of tributes from a host of famous faces, including Daily Show host Jon Stewart, Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl Hines.\nIn a post on Instagram, Curtis called her former co-star \"deep and so freaking funny\".\n\"He also is the reason I am sober. He helped me. I am forever grateful for him for that act of grace alone,\" she said.\nIn a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, fellow comedian Bill Burr called Lewis a\"true original\".\n\"An absolutely fearless comedian who did and said what he wanted\", Burr wrote.",
    "As Serhiy slowly began to regain consciousness in his hospital bed in Kyiv, he realised he couldn't see, speak, or feel his legs - but he could hear his wife Valeria's voice. Comforted, he lost consciousness again.\nIt was a pattern that lasted weeks. The severely injured Ukrainian soldier would wake up to darkness and panic, unable to communicate because of the tube down his throat - but every time he heard Valeria, he settled down.\n\"That's what kept me fighting,\" he tells the BBC's Ukrainecast podcast .\n\"Until then, I only had nightmares. Terrible dreams in which I was being demolished, destroyed, chewed over - and then the light in regaining consciousness was her voice\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Because I wanted to come back to her. To fight through this, to be with her.\"\nSerhiy, 27, suffered catastrophic injuries when his vehicle hit a Russian anti-tank mine on Ukraine's frontline near Mariinka, nine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of his country.\nAs a soldier already serving before the war, he had been thrown straight into the thick of the fighting from its first day, in February 2022. He often went weeks without speaking to Valeria, who remained in their home city of Kyiv.\nHe was travelling with seven other soldiers on November 2022 when the vehicle was hit. The force of the blast broke his spine, pelvis, nose, eye sockets, gave him an open-skull brain injury, severe burns to his face and body, fractured his thigh and blew off both his lower legs. The flames from the blast cauterised his wounds, inadvertently saving his life.\nHe can't remember anything from that day - but Valeria will never forget it.\n\"I didn't expect he would come back from the war with both his legs,\" Valeria says. \"But even I wasn't prepared for the extent of his wounds when I saw him.\"\n\"My first thought was just relief that he was alive because, by the description of what happened to him, it was not clear that he would ever regain consciousness. So I went to the hospital and I saw my beloved, full of different tubes, totally unresponsive. And that was scariest part.\"\nSerhiy regained consciousness after 20 days in a coma. He then spent another week in intensive care, another two weeks in the traumatic injuries unit and then months in rehabilitation.\nHe has a stoic approach to his injuries, and says that, for him, losing two legs is better than losing one arm. Valeria takes a similarly pragmatic approach: \"A blind, legless husband - it's not so bad,\" she laughs, adding that as a former dentist she's just relieved he didn't lose his teeth.\nLast week, after travelling to the US in the hope of saving a fraction of the sight in his remaining eye, he was told the devastating news that it couldn't be saved - that he had fully lost his eyesight.\nAlthough the couple were disappointed, they remain hopeful for the future and Serhiy now wants to spend his life advocating for and helping his fellow injured soldiers.\n\"I have so many plans that one lifetime isn't enough for all of it,\" he says. \"I definitely will go back to Ukraine. That's my country. I fought for it. I sustained [my] wounds for it.\"\nHe plans to launch two organisations, he says, both aimed at helping wounded veterans, including one to build infrastructure for their life after the war.\nBoth Ukraine and Russia refuse to release figures of their wounded and dead soldiers, but US officials, quoted by the New York Times, put the number at 70,000 dead and as many as 120,000 injured, as of August 2023.\nWhile Serhiy maintains that his injuries haven't changed him, Valeria disagrees.\n\"He has become more responsible. He was responsible before, but it was his family, his military unit,\" she explains.\n\"But now he feels responsible for the whole country, for all of Ukraine.\"\nAdditional reporting by Arsenii Sokolov",

    "Celebrities including Piers Morgan, Nigella Lawson and Oprah Winfrey have criticised the use of AI deepfake online adverts that gave the false impression they had endorsed a US influencer's controversial self-help course.\nThe adverts promoted the so-called \"Genie Script\", the centrepiece of a \"manifestation\" course sold for $37 (\u00c2\u00a329) a time by Wesley \"Billion Dollar\" Virgin.\nHe describes himself as a motivational coach who has 1.1 million followers on Instagram and claims to be worth $40m.\nThe videos, used to lure buyers to purchase the product, claim the Genie Script is a \"missing\" Hebrew Bible scripture of just 20 words that could - supposedly - change your life.\nIts promotion blends pseudo-science, conspiracy theories and the manipulation of celebrity likenesses - all to draw in customers desperate for the chance to take control of their fate.\nOne advert used footage of Nigella Lawson chatting about her recipes and work as a TV chef.\n\"I went on vacation and met this man at a very exclusive party. His name was Wesley and he handed me this hidden Bible page that was locked away in somebody's room,\" the voice said.\nBut it was not that of Lawson, it was the barely indistinguishable mimicry of an AI voice generator.\nReal footage is overlaid with a deepfake impersonation of the food writer's voice, making it sound like she was attributing her success directly to Wesley Virgin's guidance.\nThe AI voice suggested that the script revealed by Virgin unlocked the secret to manifestation, a practice which involves thinking about or writing down your aspirations to turn them into reality.\n\"He said: 'Repeat this mantra every single day of your life\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Since that moment I've become a multimillionaire all on my own.\"\nA spokesperson for Lawson branded the advertisement \"fraudulent\" and \"of great concern\".\nAnother advert showed what looked like an excerpt from the Piers Morgan Uncensored TV show and employed similar techniques.\nThe voice described \"a lost old scripture that has been used by kings to attract vast riches, miraculous healing and unparalleled love\", and it looked like the mouth had been manipulated to fit the speech.\nThe real Piers Morgan told the BBC the advert was \"another example of a very worrying trend of public figures being misused by deepfake AI manipulators for financial gain\".\n\"The real victims will be members of the public who unwittingly buy these products believing the celebrity endorsements are genuine,\" he said.\n\"Reviews\" of the script appear online, where users praise Virgin and say they hope the script will help them with escaping poverty or spending more time with their children or grandchildren.\nBoth adverts, which appeared on YouTube, have now been taken down.\nA spokesperson for YouTube said it had \"long prohibited the use of manipulated media, including deepfakes and other forms of doctored content to deceive or mislead users\".\nHaving reviewed these videos, Prof Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said they were \"clearly deepfakes\".\n\"Of course, as the technology to create these fake audio and video improves, it will become increasingly difficult to detect these fakes. And the technology is improving at a stunning rate,\" he added.\nAnother advert, this time featuring Oprah Winfrey, was discovered in the Ad Library for the Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram. Genuine footage had been overlaid, again with AI providing fake dialogue sounding like the US chat show queen.\n\"I want to give you a 20-word script... think of it like installing a new operating system into your mind that's programmed to make you rich,\" the AI Oprah says.\nA spokesperson for the real Oprah told the BBC she did not have anything to do with Virgin's product.\n\"We seek to protect consumers from the false association of Ms Winfrey and the misuse of AI to create such false advertising,\" they said.\nMeta said it took action on the adverts it found to be in violation of its policies.\nWhen the BBC contacted Wesley Virgin he said the adverts were \"the work of affiliates\", people who can earn money by helping him make sales, and that he was \"in the process of banning them all\".\nBut videos still prominent on the 44-year-old's YouTube channel demonstrate the huge effort he has put into mentoring an online team of volunteers hoping to share in his fortunes, therefore boosting his own bank account.\nWith titles such as \"Make $800+ A DAY Online For FREE Copy & Pasting Links!\", Virgin urges viewers to spread the word about his products, such as the Genie Script, across social media.\nPromising rapid returns and a high commission rate, he encourages potential recruits to paste a web link to the sales platform Digistore24 into multiple meditation groups, along with messages promising a \"free meditation\" to those who click on it.\nBut the link would take users to an online check-out for Virgin's manifestation courses - after they had watched a sales pitch video with outlandish claims and an inaccu",

    "Volodymyr Zelensky says 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed during Russia's full-scale invasion.\nThe Ukrainian president said he would not give the number of wounded as that would help Russian military planning.\nTypically, Ukrainian officials do not make casualty figures public, and other estimates are much higher.\nIt comes after the defence minister said half of all Western aid for Ukraine has been delayed, costing lives and territory.\nMr Zelensky said on Sunday that he was providing an updated death toll in response to the inflated figures that Russia has quoted.\n\"31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died in this war. Not 300,000 or 150,000, or whatever Putin and his lying circle are saying. But each of these losses is a great loss for us.\"\nSpeaking about the wider losses in the war, Mr Zelensky said tens of thousands of civilians had died in the areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia but the true number was unknown.\n\"I don't know how many of them died, how many were killed, how many were murdered, tortured, how many were deported.\"\nIt is rare for Ukraine to provide a military death toll, and other estimates suggest a much higher number.\nUS officials in August put the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed at 70,000 and as many as 120,000 injured .\nIn terms of Russian losses, Mr Zelensky said 180,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and tens of thousands more injured.\nBBC Russian, in a joint project with the Mediazona website, has established the names of more than 45,000 Russian servicepeople who had died. But it estimates the total number to be greater than that.\nIn February, the UK's defence ministry estimated that 350,000 Russian troops had been killed or injured.\nPresident Zelensky's address came after his defence minister, Rustam Umerov, called out the country's Western allies for delays in military aid.\n\"At the moment, commitment does not constitute delivery,\" he said.\nUkraine is currently experiencing a variety of setbacks in its mission to drive Russia from its territory.\nMr Umerov said that the lack of supplies put Ukraine at a further disadvantage \"in the mathematics of war\".\n\"We do everything possible and impossible but without timely supply it harms us,\" he said.\nGermany warned in November that a European Union (EU) plan to deliver a million artillery shells by March would not be met.\nIn January, the EU said just over half of these would reach Ukraine by the deadline and that the promised amount would not be there until the end of 2024.\nPresident Zelensky said one of the reasons Ukraine's highly anticipated counter-offensive last year did not start earlier was the lack of weapons.\nThat counter-offensive largely failed - one of a number of setbacks Kyiv has faced after some early successes in repelling Russia after it invaded in February 2022.\nMr Zelensky also suggested on Sunday that plans for the counter-offensive were leaked to Russia ahead of time.\nLast week, it was announced that Ukrainian troops had withdrawn from the key eastern town of Avdiivka - Moscow's biggest win in months.\nMr Zelensky also blamed this partly on faltering Western weapon supplies.\nThe Biden administration, meanwhile, has said the hold-up in Congress of a $60bn aid package for Ukraine contributed to the fall of the town.\nWestern leaders travelled to Kyiv on Saturday in a show of solidarity with Ukraine as the country marked two years since Russia's full-scale invasion.\nThere, it was announced that Italy and Canada had signed security deals with Ukraine - bolstering support until the country could join Nato.\nCanada's deal included more than three billion Canadian dollars (\u00c2\u00a31.7bn) in financial and defence aid.\nIt is not only Ukraine that is having trouble resourcing its military activities. Russia is also struggling to provide ammunition and weapons , according to Western officials.\n\"Russia's domestic ammunition production capabilities are currently insufficient for meeting the needs of the Ukraine conflict,\" a Western official claimed.\nThey added that Moscow has been able to increase its supply only by seeking out alternative sources of ammunition and weapons, which do not offer a long-term solution.",

They also coordinate military plans and carry out joint military exercises .\nAfter Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Nato said that it posed the \"most significant and direct threat to allies' security\" .\nWhich countries are Nato members?\nNato has 31 members across Europe and North America, including the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Turkey.\nAfter the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries joined: Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.\nSweden and Finland applied to join in May 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They had previously been neutral for decades.\nFinland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023.\nSweden's membership was delayed because of opposition from both Turkey and Hungary.\nTurkey said Sweden was giving refuge to Kurdish militants, and needed to do more to crack down on rebel groups like the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which it considers a terrorist organisation. However, it decided to back Sweden's membership in January .\nHungary's government, which was angry that Sweden had accused it of behaving undemocratically , has also now supported Sweden's membership.\nSteps will now be taken to formally make Sweden a Nato member.\nWith Sweden and Finland joining Nato, it is seeing its biggest expansion since the 1990s. They will add nearly 300,000 active and reserve troops to the alliance's ranks.\nUkraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia also hope to join Nato.\nWhen will Ukraine join Nato?\nNato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said it is \"inevitable\" that Ukraine will become a member, but not until its war with Russia ends.\nPresident Zelensky has asked for Ukraine to be admitted as soon as possible afterwards.\nSince July 2023, the Nato-Ukraine Council has coordinated efforts to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia.\nRussia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine joining Nato, fearing it would bring the alliance's forces too close to its own territory.\nHow much do Nato members spend on defence?\nNato asks member states to spend at least 2% of their national income on defence.\nThe US spends nearly 3.5% and several countries which border Russia - such as Poland and the Baltic Republics - also spend more than 2% on their armed forces.\nUK spending is just above the 2% target.\nHowever, countries such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain spent less than the target in 2023 .\nFormer US President Donald Trump, who is campaigning for re-election, controversially said he would encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough on defence .\nNato said there was an \"unprecedented rise\" in defence spending by several members in 2023 , and that 18 countries were expected to meet the 2% level in 2024.\nWhat weapons are Nato countries giving Ukraine?\nAs a group, Nato has not sent weapons to Ukraine, but several individual member countries have.\nThe US, UK, Germany and Turkey have provided anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems, artillery guns, tanks and military drones.\nThe US and UK have also supplied long-range missiles.\nThe US is allowing two Nato countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, to transfer US-made F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine , once pilots have been trained to fly them.\nUkrainian media say the first planes could arrive in spring 2024 .\nHowever, Nato countries have not sent troops to Ukraine, and ruled out using their air forces to impose a no-fly zone over the country, because of fears such action could provoke a direct conflict with Russia.\nHow is Nato increasing its defences against Russia?\nIn 2023, Nato commanders agreed detailed plans for countering possible Russian attacks in the Arctic and north Atlantic, central Europe, or the Mediterranean region.\nIt also announced plans to increase the number of its troops in Europe on high alert from 40,000 to more than 300,000 . In addition, it has bolstered its defences on its eastern flank, bordering Russia, with eight battlegroups .\nUntil the end of May, Nato is staging Steadfast Defender , one of its largest ever military exercises, involving 90,000 personnel from all 31 Nato countries, plus Sw",
    "Heavy gunfire has been heard in Chad's capital N'Djamena following a deadly attack on the headquarters of the National Security Agency (ANSE).\nSeveral people were killed in Wednesday's attack, the government said - blaming the opposition Socialist Party Without Borders (PSF).\nIts leader, Yaya Dillo, told the AFP news agency the allegation was a \"lie\".\nThe unrest comes a day after the announcement that Chad will hold presidential elections on 6 May.\nN'Djamena residents reported hearing intense gunfire near the PSF's main office on Wednesday and said they had seen several military vehicles heading there.\nOne witness told Reuters that the PSF buildings had been cordoned off.\nCommunication Minister Abderaman Koulamallah said the earlier attack on the ANSE buildings was led by Mr Dillo, who denied he was there - telling AFP the accusation was intended \"to make me afraid so that I don't go to the election\".\nOne of Mr Dillo's colleagues, the PSF's general secretary, told Reuters that contrary to the government's claim that its members had attacked the ANSE building, they had been the ones to come under attack from soldiers while trying to retrieve the body of their colleague Ahmed Torabi.\nThe PSF official said Mr Torabi was arrested and shot dead on Tuesday, before his body was dumped outside the ANSE buildings.\nAccording to the government, Mr Torabi had attempted to assassinate the president of the Supreme Court.\nRelatives and party members who tried to get to his body were shot at on Wednesday morning, resulting in multiple fatalities, the general secretary said.\nMr Dillo also denied any links to the assassination attempt, which he described as \"staged\", according to AFP.\nThe government said PSF members had been arrested or were being sought over the attack on the ANSE headquarters and would be prosecuted.\n\"Anyone looking to disturb the democratic process under way in the country will be prosecuted and brought to justice,\" the government said in a statement quoted by AFP.\nIt is not clear if Mr Dillo was among those arrested, but in a Facebook post on Wednesday morning he said the military had come for him at his party headquarters.\nIn addition to the violence, internet connectivity has been disrupted in the country, according to internet watchdog Netblocks.\nMr Dillo is a vocal opponent of his cousin, President Mahamat D\u00c3\u00a9by, who came into power in 2021 after the latter's father was killed by rebels after three decades in power.\nMr D\u00c3\u00a9by promised to return the country to civilian rule - but delayed it for more than two years.\nThe May election is supposed to mark the end of the political transition.\nThe Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS) designated President D\u00c3\u00a9by as its candidate for the upcoming elections, but he is yet to openly comment on whether he will run.\nFormer colonial power France has been backing Mr D\u00c3\u00a9by since the start of the transition, raising eyebrows both in and out of the country.\nFrance currently has about 1,000 troops in Chad to fight jihadist groups across West Africa.\nThe opposition said the electoral commission is far from neutral and it fears an extension of the D\u00c3\u00a9by dynasty.\nYou may be interested in:",

    "The boss of Ryanair has said holidaymakers will face higher fares this summer due to new Boeing planes being delivered late.\nChief executive Michael O'Leary said the delayed delivery of the planes will constrain capacity for passengers.\nHe said that Ryanair's ticket prices could be up to 10% more expensive this summer as a result.\nRyanair hopes to get some compensation, but is focused on getting planes delivered, Mr O'Leary added.\nHe said that a delivery of 57 Boeing 737 Max 8200's was due by March, but the firm thinks only 40-45 may arrive in time for the summer season.\nBoeing has been facing scrutiny since an incident in January when a piece of one of its jets blew out during a passenger flight. The Alaska Airline passenger flight did not lead to serious injuries but forced an emergency landing.\nAs a result, Mr O'Leary said, the US manufacturer had the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, \"crawling all over them\".\nMajor concerns have been raised about quality control for new Boeing aircraft, sparking a slowdown in production speed.\nMr O'Leary said costs saved through hedging on fuel would mean that Ryanair's fare increase would not be as steep as the 17% rise seen in 2023.\nSome other airlines also have capacity constraints caused by aircraft not being available, he added.\nA problem with Pratt & Whitney engines, for example, has grounded a number of Airbus planes used by carriers such as Wizz Air.\nMr O'Leary told reporters that there would be a \"higher fare environment across Europe\" this summer.\nRyanair's original forecast for the year to the end of March 2025 was that it would carry 205 million passengers, up from 183.5 million in the 12 months before.\nSpeaking at the firm's Dublin headquarters, Mr O'Leary said: \"With less aircraft, maybe we'll have to bring that 205 million down towards 200 million passengers.\"\n\"If capacity was growing, I think fares would be falling,\" he added.\nLucy Coutts, investment director at JM Finn, told the BBC's Today programme: \"Boeing itself has said there are going to be 9,000 fewer seats this summer available because of the delays at the company.\n\"Ryanair is a low-cost carrier and so its hikes of 10% are a little bit higher than the average at 3-7% but it is because it is coming from a low base.\"\nDiscussing the issues that have engulfed the US plane maker Boeing, Mr O'Leary described the message he was currently getting from the firm as \"confusion\".\nThe boss of the carrier has repeatedly backed Boeing's top management, but criticised the plane maker's quality control standards.\nHe does not think the removal of the 737 Max programme's boss Ed Clark was the right move, arguing that having both a replacement for Mr Clark and a new president for quality did not make sense.\nRyanair, he said, wanted one person in charge who was monitoring the situation daily, having previously said their products were \"great aircraft, it's just that they're not making them on time or delivering them in time\".\nA spokesperson for Boeing said: \"We are communicating with customers that some delivery schedules may change as we take the necessary time to make sure that every airplane we deliver is high quality and meets all customer and regulatory requirements.\nThey added that they \"deeply regret the impact this is having on our valued customer Ryanair\".\n\"We're working to address their concerns and taking action on a comprehensive plan to strengthen 737 quality and delivery performance.\"",
    "There were angry clashes at Prime Minister's Questions, as the main party leaders rowed about the records of their predecessors.\nLabour's Keir Starmer said Rishi Sunak should take action over comments former PM Liz Truss made at a conference.\nSir Keir accused her of \"slagging off and undermining Britain\" during an event in the United States.\nIn return, Mr Sunak called him \"spineless\" and \"utterly shameless\" for serving under Jeremy Corbyn.\nHe added this meant the Labour leader had failed to take action while \"while antisemitism ran rife in his party\" during his predecessor's tenure.\nThe latest bout of mud-slinging at PMQs began when Sir Keir mocked Ms Truss for comments she made at a gathering of US conservatives last week.\nThe former prime minister told the event that she had faced a \"huge establishment backlash\" during her 49-day premiership from various government agencies and the Bank of England.\nThe Labour leader accused her of claiming she was \"sabotaged by the deep state\", quipping that it showed the Conservatives had become the \"political wing of the Flat Earth Society\".\nHe also criticised Ms Truss for remaining \"silent\" whilst another speaker at the conference, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, described anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson as a \"hero\". Ms Truss did not respond to questions about the incident on Wednesday.\n\"Why is he allowing her to stand as a Tory MP at the next election?\" Sir Keir added.\nCorbyn legacy\nMr Sunak replied that he didn't believe \"a single [MP]\" supported Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who founded the far-right English Defence League.\nAnd in what is becoming a familiar move at PMQs, he sought to turn the tables on Sir Keir by highlighting his stint as a shadow cabinet minister under Mr Corbyn.\nThe party has barred its former leader from standing as a Labour candidate at the next election over his response to a highly critical report into antisemitism within the party during his tenure.\n\"If he wants to talk about former leaders and predecessors, the whole country knows his record... because he sat there while antisemitism ran rife in his party,\" the prime minister added.\nHe said other Labour frontbenchers had refused to serve under Mr Corbyn, but Sir Keir had not, because he was \"spineless, hopeless and utterly shameless\".\nAs the angry exchanges continued, the Labour leader shot back that he had \"changed my party for the better\" while Mr Sunak was \"being changed by his party\".\nWith the decibel level increasing, some MPs gesticulated towards Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to urge him to step in and calm the debate down.\nBut Sir Lindsay, who is facing down calls to quit as Speaker over his handling of a chaotic debate on Gaza last week, did not intervene in the way he normally does to quieten the chamber.\n'Foil-hat brigade'\nMr Sunak then took this as his cue to bring up Thursday's by-election in Rochdale, where Labour has withdrawn support from its candidate after he allegedly told a party meeting Israel had \"allowed\" Hamas to attack it as a pretext to invade Gaza.\nHe criticised the Labour leader for his initial decision to stand by Azhar Ali, adding he had backed him \"for days\" before then pulling support when more of his comments came to light.\nMr Ali, who subsequently apologised for the comments, is still standing in the contest. You can find here a full list of the by-election candidates .\nThe Labour leader also accused the Conservatives of dancing to a \"tune\" set by former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whose Reform UK party has been challenging the Tories from the right on issues including immigration.\n\"The prime minister has lost control of his party to the hordes of malcontents, the tin-foil-hat brigade over there,\" he added.\nMr Sunak did not respond directly, instead celebrating the the Conservatives' record of diversity among its leaders.\nMr Farage, who co-founded Reform and is its honorary president, replied on X, formerly Twitter, that \"millions of Labour voters\" agreed with him, rather than Sir Keir, on \"stopping mass migration and our increasingly unrecognisable cities\".",
    "The Post Office has confirmed that its current boss, Nick Read, is under investigation, after its former chairman Henry Staunton shocked MPs by making the revelation.\nMr Staunton was at a hearing to discuss compensation payments to sub-postmasters at the centre of the Horizon scandal.\nAlan Bates, who inspired an ITV drama on the issue, told MPs the government should \"get on and pay people\".\nThe investigation is ongoing.\nThe Post Office confirmed there were complaints against Mr Read and other staff.\nMPs were questioning a number of key figures about the pace of financial redress for thousands of sub-postmasters.\nThe MPs had been told by witnesses earlier in the day that an internal investigation was under way into Mr Staunton over his alleged behaviour while he chaired the company.\nHowever, Mr Staunton alleged that there was actually an investigation into Mr Read.\nHe also claimed that within an 80-page document - a page of which he showed to MPs, with many lines redacted - it was said that Mr Read wanted to resign from the Post Office because he was unhappy with his pay.\nThe Post Office released a statement saying Nick Read \"has never tendered his resignation and he continues to accept leadership responsibility for the challenges that we are all working on each day\".\nIt added that there is \"a complaint\" against Mr Read and other employees, and that he \"has cooperated fully with the investigation\".\nThe Department for Business and Trade said that it was aware that Mr Read was also under investigation but it had \"not seen the 80-page report referred to by Henry Staunton and cannot attest to the content\".\nDowning Street has also insisted it has confidence in the Post Office boss, with the prime minister's deputy spokesperson saying: \"We continue to work very closely with him.\n\"It's important at this point that everyone remains focused on ensuring we have the compensation and justice for the postmasters.\"\nSome 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted by the Post Office for theft and false accounting between 1999 and 2015 after the Horizon IT system, developed by Fujitsu, made it look like there were shortfalls at branch accounts.\nIt led to what has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history.\nThousands more pumped their own money into the Post Office shops they managed to cover discrepancies caused by Horizon.\nSub-postmasters are seeking compensation from the government, but Mr Bates said the government - which owns the Post Office - has failed to get a grip on the process of paying money to claimants.\n\"It's very disappointing,\" he said. \"This has been going on for years, as you well know, and I can't see any end to it.\"\nMr Staunton, who was sacked as Post Office chair in January, said the compensation process had slowed right down until the Mr Bates vs The Post Office drama was aired in January and re-ignited interest in the long-running scandal.\nThe slow pace at which postmasters are receiving compensation risked being overshadowed by a recent row between Mr Staunton and Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch.\nMr Staunton gave an interview more than a week ago claiming that he had been told by a senior civil servant in January last year to slow down the spend on compensation.\nMs Badenoch hit back at the claims, saying they were \"completely false\". She also said she had sacked Mr Staunton following \"very serious allegations about his conduct while chair of the Post Office\". Concerns were also raised about the process of appointing a senior independent director at the Post Office, whose role includes challenging the chair on any issues. The appointment would replace Ben Tidswell, who is stepping down later this year.\nMr Staunton said on Tuesday that he was the victim of a \"smear campaign\", before he claimed that Mr Read was at the centre of an investigation, consisting of allegations made by the Post Office's former HR boss. Mr Staunton claims that Mr Read and the senior HR person \"fell out\".\nThe ex-chair also claimed that Mr Read had tried to resign four times during the time Mr Staunton was at the Post Office, between December 2022 and January 2024.\nThat contrasted with comments by Mr Read a short time earlier when, asked by MPs if he had ever tried to resign from the Post Office, he said under oath: \"No. Why do you ask?\"\nThe Department for Business and Trade said that Ms Badenoch \"was clear in her statement to the House of Commons on 19 February that she lost confidence in Mr Staunton because he was blocking an investigation into his conduct, as well as his attempt to bypass the formal process to appoint a new director to the board\".\nIt added: \"The department will await the outcome of the investigation into Mr Read before making any further judgement.\"\nHowever, speaking on BBC Radio 4's PM programme on Tuesday, Charlotte Nichols, a Labour MP who sits on the Commons Business committee, hit out at Ms Badenoch after the hearing.\n\"I think [Tuesday's hearing] really raises a number o",

    "A rare Amazonian cactus that blooms only once a year before its flower dies in just 12 hours has been put under the microscope for possibly the first time.\nThe moonflower, or Strophocactus wittii, is part of the collection at Cambridge University Botanic Garden .\nIt recently produced three flowers for the first time and as soon as the first faded, it was whisked off to the university's Sainsbury Laboratory.\nScientists hope to uncover its \"secrets\" and explain unusual cells.\nIt is relatively \"rare\" for the plants to bloom in captivity and when it happened in Cambridge in February 2021, it was believed to be the first time one had flowered in the UK .\nA live webcam trained on the bud that year was watched by about 500,000 people around the world.\n\"The tropical cactus is... difficult to get hold of to study when its native habitat is in the Brazilian rainforest,\" a spokeswoman at the garden said.\nHowever, with a microscope close at hand, scientists have taken advantage of this year's bloom.\n\"As far as they know, this is the first time the moonflower has been examined using an advanced low-temperature scanning electron microscope (cryo-SEM),\" she added.\nDr Raymond Wightman, the lab's microscopy manager, said it was a \"grab it and go moment - and within minutes it was under the microscope\".\n\"It was a stroke of luck we had the microscope already set up for something that didn't happen - and we were able to take hundreds of photographs of this fresh specimen,\" he said.\n\"Hardly anything is known about this plant and we often can't be sure whether we're looking at petals, or sepals - the bud protectors - so in this case we call them 'tepals'. It means we're not sure what we're looking at, as everything is the same colour - a creamy-white.\"\nHe and his colleague, PhD student Kristina Buch, ran across the garden to get the flower once it had died off.\n\"Taking a closer look at the moonflower was a spontaneous wildcard,\" Ms Buch said.\n\"Over the past two years we have been using the cryo-SEM microscope to study petal surfaces across various plant species, but never those of a night-flowering plant, let alone of such a rare tropical specimen.\n\"This was an opportunity to take a closer look at the different petal-like structures layered into the flower, which we think are tepals - neither petals or sepals.\"\nShe said the images revealed \"some surprises that deserve additional investigation\".\nDr Wightman agreed, saying: \"There were possibly some peculiar-shaped cells we've not seen before and some cells I didn't recognise - and it looks like it could be something non-typical.\n\"We'll go over the images, and then next year there might be more to look at, but it could take years before we have something to publish.\n\"However, we now have a permanent record of something so rare that we're not sure has ever been seen before under the microscope.\"\nHe added: \"And it's always nice to see something different - it's a bit exciting and it wakes me up.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has claimed he has been a victim of political persecution since leaving office just over a year ago.\nHe told tens of thousands of supporters in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo that coup allegations against him were a \"lie\".\nHe also called for an amnesty for hundreds of his supporters convicted for attacks on public buildings.\nPolice are investigating whether Mr Bolsonaro incited a failed coup after losing the 2022 election.\nAddressing Sunday's rally in Brazil's largest city, the 68-year-old former president dismissed the allegations against him as politically motivated.\nHe said it was time to forget the past and let Brazil move on.\nHe also used his speech to talk about the next presidential elections in 2026.\nMr Bolsonaro is still barred from running for office for eight years for undermining the electoral system in Brazil and claiming the last election was fraudulent, despite there being no evidence of electoral fraud.\nHuge crowds wearing yellow and green - the colours of the Brazilian flag - gathered to hear Mr Bolsonaro speak. Those I have spoken to say they are here demonstrating for freedom, and in particular freedom of speech.\nThey criticise what they see as threats to put Mr Bolsonaro in prison for \"saying his opinion\".\nSeveral of his supporters at the rally repeated unproven claims that the last election was fraudulent. He had asked them not to bring posters saying this or criticising institutions like the Supreme Court.\nAlexandre Fran\u00c3\u00a7a, a 53-year-old commercial director, told the BBC many people gathered for the rally because \"we must express what we want for our country.\n\"Today everyone is afraid of being repressed. So I think we're here to show our faces. We want Brazil for everybody, freedom for everybody,\" he added.\nRog\u00c3\u00a9rio Morgado, a 55-year-old military official, was another rally participant interviewed by the BBC. He said: \"Brazilian politicians are afraid of people on the streets, it's the only thing that Brazilian politicians are afraid of.\"\nMr Bolsonaro's speech is being watched closely by the authorities for anything that could be seen as inciting riots or undermining the electoral system.\nEarlier this month, the former president had to surrender his passport as he is facing an investigation over the accusations that he tried to overturn the October 2022 election results and pressure military chiefs to join a coup attempt.\nAfter he lost the poll to the left-winger Luiz In\u00c3\u00a1cio Lula da Silva, thousands of his supporters stormed government buildings in the capital Bras\u00c3\u00adlia - including the presidential palace, the Supreme Court and Congress - looting and vandalising the buildings.\nThree of Mr Bolsonaro's allies have since been arrested, and the head of his political party has also been detained.\nPolice accuse them of spreading doubts about the electoral system, which became a rallying cry for his supporters.\nThis, police argue, set the stage for a potential coup. When it failed to get the support of the armed forces, however, his frustrated supporters stormed Congress, the building housing the Supreme Court and the presidential palace, on 8 January last year.\nMr Bolsonaro was in the US when the attack on Congress happened. He returned to Brazil in March 2023, saying he had nothing to fear.\nHe remains the most influential figurehead for the right in Brazilian politics.",

    "The miners' strike of 1984-85 was a defining moment in the history of British coal mining and the biggest industrial dispute in post-war Britain.\nIt pitted thousands of miners and their trade union against then prime minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative government, which supported plans to shut 20 coal pits.\nWhat was the 1984 miners' strike and why was it important?\nAbout three quarters of the country's 187,000 miners went on strike to oppose the pit closures, which were expected to mean 20,000 job losses.\nThousands of officers were drafted in to police the picket lines, with violence breaking out at times.\nThe miners' eventual defeat was the end of an era for Britain's trade union movement and helped cement Mrs Thatcher's reputation as the Iron Lady.\nIt paved the way for the privatisation of more nationalised industries and utilities, including steel, railways, gas, telecoms and water.\nA wave of pit closures followed the strike and almost all of the UK's deep coal mines - where digging takes place underground - were shut within the next 20 years.\nIt caused lasting unemployment and poverty in former mining areas, just as the workers had warned with their slogan \"Close a pit, kill a community\".\nIn 2019, Sheffield Hallam University researchers said the former coalfield areas - with a combined population of 5.7 million people - continue to be dogged by deprivation and poor health.\nWhat caused the strike and how did it begin?\nThe National Coal Board (NCB) ran the country's collieries - coal mines or pits and their buildings - and distributed coal. It wanted to close 20 pits it said were unprofitable.\nFormer miner Arthur Scargill, then president of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), believed no pit should close if it had coal reserves. He claimed there was a plan for more than 70 closures, something only confirmed in 2014 when old cabinet papers were released .\nThe national strike is widely considered to have begun at Cortonwood Colliery in South Yorkshire on 5 March 1984 after miners learned the NCB wanted to speed up plans to close their pit. Two weeks earlier, miners at Polmaise Colliery in Stirlingshire had also gone on strike to oppose pit closures.\nWalkouts followed elsewhere and the NUM declared a national strike on 12 March 1984, despite having held no national vote.\nThe High Court ruled the strike was illegal in October 1984 because it had not followed NUM rules, although the Scottish High Court had ruled it was legal in Scotland the previous month.\nWhere did miners strike?\nThe majority of miners in England, Wales and Scotland walked out, but some kept working because they disagreed with the NUM's position.\nRobert Gildea, emeritus professor of modern history at the University of Oxford, said: \"Areas at risk of losing more pits were more liable to strike. The small Kent coalfield was destined for total closure. South Wales and Scotland would lose two-thirds of their pits.\n\"Nottinghamshire, by contrast, was spared. This was partly because the pits were seen to be more efficient, and partly to divide the miners.\"\nEven when national support was at its highest, most of Nottinghamshire's 30,000 miners kept working and long-lasting community divisions were created.\nProfessor David Howell, who teaches politics at the University of York, said many of the Nottinghamshire miners were focused on their area rather than any wider solidarity.\n\"Their pit culture was characterised by co-operation with management in pursuit of high productivity and high earnings underpinned by optimism about future employment,\" he said.\nHow did Margaret Thatcher's government respond?\nMrs Thatcher had seen how miners' strikes in 1972 and 1974 caused blackouts as power stations were left without fuel, undermining the governments of the day.\nShe was determined to win any battle with the miners and had prepared meticulously for a potential strike, including stockpiling six months' worth of coal to keep the country's power stations running.\nThe government had previously introduced anti-strike legislation and told police to stop pickets from intimidating miners who wanted to work.\nWhen Mrs Thatcher died in 2013, NUM secretary Chris Kitchen said he would not shed a tear for someone responsible for \"vindictive acts\" towards mining communities.\nWhat role did police have and how many people were arrested?\nThe National Reporting Centre was set up to co-ordinate police operations and extra officers were drafted in from forces nationwide.\nMore than 11,000 people were arrested - mostly for public order offences - and more than 8,000 prosecuted. Arrested miners were likely to lose their jobs and some never worked again.\nIn 2020, the Scottish government said it would pardon convicted miners after a review found it was unlikely many would have been prosecuted today.\nThere are also continuing calls for a public inquiry into the actions of police during a violent clash known as the Battle of Orgreave .\nOn 18 June 1984, around 6,000 officer",

The sales documents show the transfer from the Royal Lofts in Norfolk.\nBut Mr Sutton rejected suggestions of cruelty or ill-treatment for pigeons and said that for long-distance races, the welfare of the birds was \"paramount\".\n\"Throughout their entire lifetime, during competition or at rest, we provide a secure and suitable environment,\" he said.\n\"As fanciers we ensure that the pigeons receive the necessary training and support prior to competition, which we conduct at the appropriate time in the safest weather conditions.\"",
    "A Palestinian refugee is taking legal action against the Home Office over what he says is in effect a refusal to grant visas to his family in Gaza.\nThe Home Office rejected the man's request to allow his wife and four young children to apply for visas without giving fingerprints.\nTwo of his children caught hepatitis A , which the World Health Organization says is spreading in Gaza .\nThe Home Office told BBC News it did not comment on individual cases.\n\"All applications are carefully considered on their individual merits and must meet the requirements of the immigration rules and published guidance,\" an official said.\n'Blame myself'\nA court anonymity order means the man and his family cannot be identified, for their own protection.\nBut in a witness statement to the court, he said he \"wanted to die\" when he had heard about the Home Office's decision.\n\"I am so afraid that my family will be killed, they will be killed while I am away from them, and I will blame myself for not being able to bring them here,\" the man said.\nPeople with refugee status can apply for family-reunion visas for their family members to join them in the UK without going through the asylum system themselves.\nAsylum Aid solicitor Anastasia Solopova, who is representing the family, told BBC News they had applied for these in December.\nIn most circumstances, when someone applies for a long-term British visa outside of the UK, they need to give their biometrics - fingerprints and a photograph - at a visa-application centre (VAC), for security reasons.\nBut because there are no working VACs in Gaza, the family had applied to either be exempt from having to give their fingerprints or be allowed to travel to Egypt to give them at a centre there.\nIn a refusal letter seen by BBC News, the Home Office told the man the government was \"not able to assist with exit/entry requirements for a third country, where a person needs to travel to that country to... submit biometrics\".\nGuidance, it adds, \"makes it clear that people must only apply for entry clearance if they can travel to the UK\".\nThere was now no way for the family to submit their biometrics, Ms Solopova said.\nAnd they had brought a judicial review, asking a judge to examine the Home Office's decision.\n\"We are challenging the decision in court - but the truth is that with every day of delay, our client's family's lives are put more in danger,\" Ms Solopova said.\n\"The Home Office should never have made this unlawful decision, which could mean that our client's wife and children could possibly die in Gaza without ever seeing our client again.\"\nEven before the current conflict, it was not easy for Palestinians to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing into Egypt.\nThey had to register with the local Palestinian authorities two to four weeks in advance and may then have been rejected by either the Palestinian or Egyptian authorities with little warning or explanation.\nAnd since the current war began, Egypt has said it is reluctant to allow an influx of refugees from Gaza.\nIn November, the Home Office told BBC News it was working with the Foreign Office to help British people and their non-British family members evacuate Gaza through the crossing.\nAnd at the time, a team of Home Office staff was helping visa applicants in Egypt.\nNow, people able to leave Gaza through the crossing can receive medical, consular and administrative support from British embassy staff in Cairo.",

    "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has publicly backed protesting farmers in Wales.\nMr Sunak met campaigning farmer Gareth Wyn Jones and others outside the Welsh Conservative conference in Llandudno.\n\"We're going to do everything we can because we've got your back,\" the Conservative prime minister said.\nProtesters are unhappy with the Labour Welsh government proposals to change farm subsidies, which will include a requirement to have trees on 10% of agricultural land.\nFarmers will also be required to earmark another 10% for wildlife habitat.\nThe Welsh government said the farm subsidy scheme was necessary in the fight against climate change, and that the programme could be adjusted after the end of a consultation currently taking place.\nMeanwhile, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies claimed that Welsh government services were a struggling due to Labour ideology .\nMr Sunak's comments about the farm subsidies came after a speech where he claimed the Welsh people were being \"treated as Labour's laboratory\", and claimed there was \"enormous anger\" over Wales' 20mph policy.\nMr Jones had posted on X, formerly Twitter, the day before that he had received death threats.\nHe said in a video he was planning to \"step back\" from the farmers' protests because he had to think about his family.\nHe said he met a police officer about the latest death threat, which he described as the \"fourth or the fifth\" he had had.\nNorth Wales Police said it was aware of the reports. Mr Jones and his family were being supported by officers while investigations were ongoing, it added.\nProtests have escalated over the Sustainable Farming Scheme in recent days and a demonstration is expected to take place in Cardiff next week.\nSince Brexit, governments in the UK have had to decide what to do with farm subsidies and whether to replace schemes previously set out by the European Union.\nMr Sunak met a crowd of protesters outside the conference venue on Friday, where a row of tractors was parked across the road.\nHe told Mr Jones: \"It's absolutely not right, the impact it will have on your jobs, your livelihoods, your incomes and food production around the country. It's simply wrong.\"\n'Let down'\nIn his conference speech, Mr Sunak also attacked the Welsh government over its 20mph speed limit policy, and its record on the NHS and education.\n\"Why are Welsh children being let down and getting the worst results in the United Kingdom? Why are Welsh farmers being abandoned?\n\"And why do they want to spend \u00c2\u00a3120m more on 36 more politicians in Cardiff, but can't provide a penny of funding to support steelworkers in Port Talbot?\n\"Wales is proof that when Labour run something, they run it badly.\n\"I'm sorry that you, the Welsh people, are being treated as Labour's laboratory.\"\nMr Sunak said he knew \"last year was hard\", but \"we're pointing in the right direction\".\nHe said inflation was down, energy prices had come down significantly and mortgage rates had started to fall.\nHe claimed that because of progress in the economy \"we have been able to afford tax cuts\".\nMr Sunak accused Labour of holding values that \"aren't those of the British people, which is why they also can't see how unfair it is that people can arrive in our country illegally and not be removed\".\nHe accused Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer of causing \"chaos and confusion over the \u00c2\u00a328bn eco promise\".\nMeanwhile David TC Davies, Conservative Secretary of State for Wales, said he did not believe dire polls predicting disaster for the party.\nIn his speech, he said: \"They tell us we're finished, that we can't win.\n\"I will have absolutely none of it, none of it. I don't spend much time looking at what opinion pollsters are saying because I'm busy doing other things.\n\"I don't know who these opinion polls are speaking to. But when we go out, as we do every weekend... the people that we meet are telling us that they are fed up with this Welsh Labour government.\"\nOn Thursday, a Welsh government spokesperson said: \"In Wales, we have maintained the Basic Payment Scheme at \u00c2\u00a3238m in 2024, which was not easy in the financial circumstances. It is something farmers asked us to do in order to provide stability and we listened.\n\"The UK government has not maintained BPS at the same levels in England and, unlike what the UK government has done in England, we are not proposing to bring forward fragmented schemes. We have developed the Sustainable Farming Scheme, in partnership with the sector, in a way which is designed to support all farmers in Wales through a Universal Baseline Payment.\"\nThey added: \"The Welsh government is committed to supporting the agriculture sector in Wales and we have been very clear working in partnership with the farming sector is key.

    "Two former sex workers who were picked up by Iain Packer say women needlessly suffered attacks after police failed to act on warnings that he was dangerous.\nIain Packer, 51, was found guilty of killing Emma Caldwell in Limefield Woods, Biggar, in April 2005.\nHe was also convicted of 11 rapes and multiple sexual assaults against 21 other women over a 26-year period.\nPolice Scotland has apologised and said victims did not get the justice they deserved from the first investigation.\nPacker was told on Wednesday he will serve a minimum of 36 years of a life sentence imposed at the High Court in Glasgow.\nHe evaded justice for almost two decades following the botched 2005 police inquiry into Emma's death.\nA re-investigation of the case in 2017 led to multiple women coming forward to speak out against the \"sex addict\".\nNicky (not her real name), 41, was one of the women who testified against Packer during the trial.\nShe said: \"He's a dangerous man, he's a scary man, I'm terrified of him - but I'm not scared to speak out against him anymore.\"\nShe claims Packer's name had been flagged to police by other sex workers in the years after Emma's death, but \"they didn't listen\".\nShe said: \"We were never believed. It was as if we didn't matter, because we put ourselves in these situations and it was our own fault.\"\nNicky raised her own concerns about Packer in 2006 after he was aggressive with her. She noted his name in a \"dodgy punters book\" held at Base 75, a former welfare centre for sex workers, based in Glasgow.\nShe said many women, like her, were too afraid to report incidents directly to the police at the time for fear of prosecution.\n\"It's something that if the police had listened back then, then a lot of stuff could have been prevented,\" she said.\n\"I might have only been giving evidence about my friend being murdered, I might not have had to give evidence about stuff that happened to me.\"\nNicky watched in court as the verdict was read out against her attacker.\nShe said she had experienced \"a mixed bag of feelings\".\n\"On the one hand I'm happy. This is a day I never thought I'd see, that he's finally being convicted.\n\"But then on the other hand I'm still sad. I'm still gutted that it took so many years.\n\"I am glad Emma's mum is getting her peace and this is closure for us all.\"\nShe added that all the women targeted by Packer had now got justice.\nMore than 20 women spoke out in court. A pattern of abusive behaviour and control was a key theme throughout their testimonies.\nCaitlin (not her real name), 37, lived at the same hostel as Emma, in Glasgow, in 2005. She was picked up twice by Packer and in the months before Emma's death, she was also taken to the same area of woodland in Biggar where Emma was killed.\n'They looked down on us'\nShe said: \"It makes me feel sick, knowing I had been there and that's what has happened to her and that's where she was found.\n\"That's something you'll never get over.\n\"Even though I've moved on from that and I'm doing well, it's still something you're going to remember.\"\nCaitlin is angry it took so long for Packer to be brought to justice and feels voices like hers were ignored because they were sex workers.\nShe said: \"They looked down on us. Didn't believe anything we said. The way they saw it was: 'We do what we do, so it's your own fault'\".\nShe added that \"hundreds of lassies had reported him, but they wouldn't listen\".\nCaitlin began working as a prostitute after becoming addicted to heroin when she was 17.\n\"When you're on drugs it's horrible,\" she said.\n\"You're not thinking about all the bad stuff and what's happening to you, and what can happen to you. You're just thinking about getting the money to get your next fix.\"\nCaitlin worked on the streets in Glasgow for 10 years and during that time claims she was raped, sexually assaulted and, on one occasion, abducted by a client.\nNow in recovery and a mum-of-two, she says she has turned her life around.\nCaitlin says she was \"scared\" to give evidence against Packer, but that it \"needed to be done\".\nShe added: \"I'm doing this for Emma's mum because it has been too long and she really needs justice for her daughter.\"\nCaitlin views the verdict as some type of closure but thinks it is important that all the women who spoke out are recognised for helping police to catch Packer.\n'Let down' by police\n\"If it wasn't for people like us standing up and letting them actually know what was going on, they would never know,\" she added.\nFollowing Wednesday's verdict, Police Scotland said Emma and many other victims had been \"let down\" by policing in 2005.\nAssistant Chief Constable for Major Crime and Public Protection Bex Smith said: \"For that we are sorry.

    "The typical annual energy bill will fall to \u00c2\u00a31,690 from April to the lowest for two years under the new price cap set by the regulator.\nIt means a drop of \u00c2\u00a3238 a year, or around \u00c2\u00a320 a month, for a household using a typical amount of energy.\nLower wholesale prices paid by suppliers have led to the cut in the price cap for April to June, which will bring some relief to billpayers.\nBut campaigners said bills are still high and many will struggle to pay.\nEnergy prices are now at their lowest level since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, even after April's drop, bills will remain well above pre-pandemic levels.\nThe regulator's price cap affects 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. Rules are different in Northern Ireland, where prices are also falling .\nOfgem sets the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity but not the total bill - so if you use more, you will pay more.\nSpecifically, in England, Wales and Scotland:\nThe regulator will add \u00c2\u00a328 to everyone's bill over a year to cover the cost of dealing with \u00c2\u00a33.1bn of debt that customers owe to suppliers.\nEnergy firms will contact customers before April to inform them of the new prices.\nHowever, whether customers' direct debits fall automatically may depend on whether they have a surplus balance with their energy supplier. If people feel they are paying too much they should contact their supplier to discuss cutting payments.\nDame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"It's good news that the cost of energy is falling, but the impact of sky-high prices will be felt for years to come.\"\n'I wear as many clothes as possible'\nFamilies - like mum Sam, from Greater Manchester, and her sons Reuben, eight, and Jenson, 10 - have been working hard to keep bills down by cutting their energy usage.\n\"I put the heating on in the morning, just to give it a little blast when the boys get up and then maybe at the evening time just for an hour, but we just try and cut back as much as possible. And I wear as many clothes, coats and things, as I can especially when I'm working from home.\n\"The boys are very aware of it because we talk openly about it,\" she said. \"That's why, as much as they do think I'm always nagging them, it's just about trying to save money and save on energy.\"\nShe said that the lower prices would take the pressure off and give \"a little bit of room in the budget\" but they would continue to save energy as much as they can.\nThe fall in energy prices has raised the prospect of suppliers trying to attract new customers by offering improved deals.\nRichard Neudegg from online price comparison website USwitch said: \"We expect there to be increased competition on the market now prices are set to fall in April.\"\nThe vast majority of people pay by direct debit, with payments smoothed out over the year. However, those who pay via prepayment meter - so pay for energy as they use it - would have benefitted more had the cut come over the winter.\nOfgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said that by April, energy bills for the average household will have fallen by \u00c2\u00a3690 since the peak of the crisis.\n\"But there are still big issues that we must tackle head-on to ensure we build a system that's more resilient for the long term and fairer to customers,\" he said.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Brearley said the regulator was looking at standing charges - a fixed daily amount which covers the costs of connecting to a supply.\nThere has been criticism about increases to these charges, and some have argued they should be abolished.\nBut Mr Brearley said the issues were complex: \"The analysis we've done says there's a large group who are made somewhat better off [by abolishing it], but there's a big but slightly smaller group who are made significantly worse off.\"\nSupport wound down\nIn the winter of 2022-23, overall energy prices were high and rises would have been bigger had it not been for the government's Energy Price Guarantee limiting the typical bill to \u00c2\u00a32,500.\nEach household also received \u00c2\u00a3400 of support over six months, but the government did not repeat the discount this winter.\nCost-of-living payments seem set to end following a final instalment this month, and no plans have been announced for a continuation of the Household Support Fund, which councils use to offer direct support.\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt could choose to address future support when he presents his Budget on 6 March.\nA spokesman for the Department for Energy Security said: \"We've halved inflation and energy prices are now significantly lower than their peak - but we recognise the challenges families are still facing.\"\nWith plans to create more flexible tariffs, Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said: \"My mission is to cut costs and get bills even lower so that families can spend their money on the things that matter most to them.\"\nLabour's shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \"Whilst it",

    "The smell of barbecued artichokes wafts along a row of dozens of tractors parked in central Barcelona, as rock music blares out of speakers, and wine is poured into plastic cups.\nThe scene is festive, but this is a protest, not a party. Hundreds of Catalan farmers have driven into their region's capital to voice their grievances, central to which is the climate.\n\"We're now in a situation where we have a full-on drought,\" says Xavier Oliva, an artichoke farmer who owns land just outside the city. \"If it doesn't rain you can't plant anything.\"\nOliva and his colleagues are protesting about a range of issues, including what they see as overly tight EU farming regulations. But the most immediate threat to their profession is posed by lack of water, and they are calling for more direct help from the regional government.\nIn late January, the water level of reservoirs supplying Barcelona and the towns surrounding it in the Ter-Llobregat basin system had dropped on average to below 16% of capacity.\nThe regional government of Catalonia responded by declaring a state of emergency affecting around six million people. That triggered the introduction of a range of restrictions on water use.\nFor livestock farmers that means only being allowed to consume half the water they would normally use, and for crop farmers like Mr Oliva, it means reducing water use by 80%.\n\"We'll plant 80% less crop than normal, or even less than that,\" says Mr Oliva, who is part of the El Prat farming cooperative, as he looks ahead to the coming months.\n\"It's pushing us closer and closer to a situation where we'll have to shut down our farms.\"\nOther measures introduced as part of the state of emergency include capping the amount of water town halls allow for consumption per day to 200 litres per person, with water pressure being reduced in towns where consumption has been particularly high. Also, river flows are being regulated, with their flows heavily reduced.\nA number of restrictions have already been in place over the last year or so, with decorative fountains switched off, and tight controls on the watering of gardens and parks and the use of water for cleaning streets. However, the new measures, which will include the arrival of boatloads of water from other Spanish regions if the drought continues, are much more drastic.\n\"We wanted to be cautious and then begin to anticipate, plan and be prepared for the worst-case scenarios, like the one we have now,\" says Meritxell Serret, Catalonia's minister for foreign action.\nCatalonia had a drought in 2007-08, but it only lasted around half the duration of this one, which began in the autumn of 2020, and is the worst since records began more than a century ago.\nA 2021 drought plan drawn up by the regional government has sought to manage the impact of the current period of abnormally low rainfall. Irrigation systems have been modernised, leaks in water pipelines mended, and a total of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2.4bn ($2.60bn; \u00c2\u00a32bn) is scheduled to be invested in increasing water production capacity in the region by 2027.\nThere has been a major drive to diversify Catalonia's water sources away from rainfall, meaning that 55% of consumption in the area affected by the drought is covered by desalinated and recycled water, with those sources due to double their output in the next three years.\n\"What we've been trying to stress for the last three years is how to prepare for these drought scenarios, how to be more resilient regarding the negative expectations regarding climate change in the Mediterranean,\" says Ms Serret.\nTemperatures are rising in the Mediterranean region 20% faster than the global average, according to the UN's Climate Programme. Other areas of Spain, such as the southern region of Andalusia, are also suffering drought, although so far only Catalonia has declared a state of emergency.\nOn the outskirts of Barcelona, Canaletas, a company that makes and exports drinking fountains, is implementing the new norms imposed by the regional government, including a 25% reduction in water consumption by industries.\n\"That 25% reduction in water use, I think industry can adapt to it - not all but most industry, at least - if it's for a short time,\" says the company's owner, Jordi Morera. \"But if this goes on indefinitely it's going to be a serious problem.\"\nCanaletas, which employs 45 people, is installing water counters in its factory to gauge where savings can be made. Mr Morera says that toilets and bathrooms are where a lot of water use will be reduced.\nHowever, he is concerned about the viability of the new guidelines. \"If your company increases its output or its personnel, reducing [water consumption] is going to be impossible,\" he says.\nOther business leaders believe that industry should be compensated for the impact of the drought and the restrictions on water use.\n\"Measures need to be taken to offset the damage caused to companies in the form of formal financial help,\" says Jaume Roura, president of UPM, Barcelona's",
    "Council tax rises are \"unjustifiable\", Humza Yousaf has said ahead of a vote on Scotland's draft budget.\nThe first minister said he hoped there could still be a council tax freeze across the whole country.\nExtra funding of \u00c2\u00a362.7m for local authorities had been announced, but only for those that freeze council tax.\nArgyll and Bute Council's Conservative, Lib Dem and independent coalition was the first to defy the government when it voted for a 10% rise last week.\nScotland's 32 local authorities have already been offered \u00c2\u00a3147m as compensation for freezing council tax.\nMSPs at Holyrood will debate and vote on the Scottish government's draft budget on Tuesday.\nMr Yousaf had pledged in his speech to the SNP conference last October that council tax bills across Scotland would be frozen in 2024-25, to help those struggling during the cost of living crisis.\nHowever, a failure to consult with council leaders ahead of the speech exacerbated tensions between the Scottish government and local authorities over funding.\nProposals announced in December's budget included a new tax band of 45p in the pound for those earning between \u00c2\u00a375,000 and \u00c2\u00a3125,140, and a \"fully funded\" council tax freeze, providing local government with the equivalent of a 5% rise.\nMr Yousaf told BBC Scotland News the government was hoping to persuade Argyll and Bute Council to reconsider.\n\"For those councils like Argyll and Bute, who I think have unjustifiably raised their council tax in the midst of a cost of living crisis, they will have to answer to their constituents,\" he said.\n\"People in this country are living through one of the worst, if not the worst, cost of living crisis we've ever seen.\n\"We can't control every household bill - we are calling for the UK government to do more in that regard - but there's one bill that can be controlled and that's the council tax, and we are providing the funding to local authorities for that.\"\nCosla, the umbrella body for Scotland's local authorities, previously warned that the freeze and potential cuts to teacher numbers were putting councils and the government in a \" fundamental position of dispute\" .\nCosla's resources spokesperson Katie Hagmann, who is also an SNP councillor in Dumfries and Galloway, said it should be up to local councils to decide on how to set council tax.\nShe said there should be no sanctions should they choose not to freeze the levy.\nShe told BBC Scotland News councils were facing really tough decisions to make sure people can \"live well locally\".\nShe said: \"Alongside the council tax freeze there has been a cut to our core revenue budget of \u00c2\u00a362.7m.\n\"It's that cut to the funding that the government has said it will look to restore, only if they take forward the council tax freeze.\"\nShe added: \"To combine it with the council tax freeze at this late stage does not seem appropriate.\"\nDeputy first minister Shona Robison defended the draft budget proposals.\nOn BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, it was suggested to Ms Robison that her policy was about punishing councils who did not go along with the freeze.\nShe said: \"This isn't about punishing councils. It's about recognising that taking together the funding that we're providing - the additional funding - is nearly \u00c2\u00a3210m.\n\"So I don't think it's unreasonable that council tax payers see some of the benefit of that.\n\"And we believe that at a time when rising prices are putting significant strain on household finances, that the council tax freeze gives some support to households over the coming year.\"\nMs Robison said local government was getting a larger share of the Scottish government's overall budget, rising from 31% to 32%.",
    "The US, UK and EU have announced new sanctions on Russia, two years after its invasion of Ukraine.\nThe measures also marked a week since the death in custody of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\nWhat are sanctions?\nSanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop them acting aggressively or breaking international law.\nThey are among the toughest measures nations can take, short of going to war.\nWhat are the latest sanctions on Russia?\nAnnouncing 500 new sanctions against Russia , US President Joe Biden said they would target Russia's war machine. Export restrictions will be imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals.\nPresident Biden said the measures would also target people connected with the imprisonment of Mr Navalny , who died in an Arctic penal camp.\nThe UK has frozen the assets of six bosses at the prison and banned them from travelling to the UK.\nThe UK has also imposed new bans on Russian metal, diamond and energy exports .\nThe EU has announced sanctions on 200 organisations and people which it says are helping Russia acquire weapons, or taking Ukrainian children from their homes.\nThe sanctions include companies and individuals involved in shipping North Korean armaments to Russia.\nWhat other sanctions have been imposed on Russia?\nSince Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US, UK and EU, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan, have imposed more than 16,500 sanctions on Russia .\nTheir main target has been Russia's money.\nForeign currency reserves worth $350bn (\u00c2\u00a3276bn) - about half its total reserves - were frozen.\nAbout 70% of the assets of Russian banks were also frozen, the EU says, and some were excluded from Swift , a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions.\nWestern nations have also:\nRussia's oil industry has been another major target.\nThe US and UK banned Russian oil and natural gas. The EU has banned seaborne crude imports.\nThe G7 - an organisation of the world's seven largest \"advanced\" economies - has imposed a maximum price of $60 (\u00c2\u00a347) a barrel on Russian crude oil, to try to reduce its earnings.\nWhich Western companies have left Russia?\nHundreds of major firms, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken, have stopped selling and making goods in Russia.\nHowever, some still do business in Russia.\nPepsiCo, for example, has been accused of continuing to sell food products in Russia . And the BBC discovered that US cosmetics firm Avon was making goods in a factory near Moscow.\nHow has Russia evaded sanctions?\nPresident Vladimir Putin has claimed European sanctions have done Russia no harm, saying: \"We have growth, and they have decline.\"\nRussia has managed to sell oil abroad for more than the G7's price cap , according to the Atlantic Council, a US think tank. It says a \"shadow fleet\" of about 1,000 tankers is used to ship it .\nThe International Energy Agency says Russia is still exporting 8.3 million barrels of oil a day - having increased supplies to India and China.\nRussia is also able to import many sanctioned Western goods by buying them through countries such as Georgia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, according to researchers at King's College London.\nChina has been a vital supplier of alternative hi-tech products to those produced in the West, says Dr Maria Snegovaya from the US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\"China sells it chips and other components it needs to for keep its military production going,\" she says. \"Russia wouldn't be able to pull that off without China's help.\"\nWhat impact have sanctions had on Russia's economy?\nIn 2022, the first year of the war, Russia's economy shrank by 2.1% , according to the International Monetary Fund.\nHowever, it estimates that Russia's economy grew by 2.2% in 2023 and predicts growth of 1.1% in 2024.\nNevertheless, the US Treasury claims sanctions are damaging Russia, having cut 5% from the economic growth it might have had over the past two years.\nBut Dr Snegovaya suggests: \"Sanctions have not made waging this war sufficiently costly for Russia, and that means it can continue with it for some time to come\".\nThe US Treasury also says that the war in Ukraine and sanctions have led more than a million people - many of them young and highly educated - to leave Russia.\nRussia's government has also been slashing health spending to fund the war in Ukraine, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence .\n\"This mainly hits people in rural areas,\" says James Nixey of foreign affairs think tank Chatham House. \"The government makes cuts there rather than in the major cities, where they might cause uprisings.\"",

But responding to Mr Macron's suggestion, Downing Street said there were no plans for a British deployment of personnel, warning that it would be a \"major escalation\" in the war.\nThe Times reports that the Home Secretary - James Cleverly - has told pro-Palestinian protestors to stop their regular demonstrations in London because they are putting huge pressure on policing. In an interview with the paper\nMr Cleverly says organisers should recognise that they had made their point - and that the rallies were \"not really saying anything new\".\nThe Guardian leads with claims by an alleged victim of sexual assault by a Conservative MP - that the party is more concerned with protecting its reputation than her welfare.\nShe says it failed to formally investigate her complaint.

It also quotes the former Defence Secretary - Ben Wallace - as saying that Britain's 'hollowed-out' military will not be 'match-fit' for the conflicts to come without a committed rise in defence spending...\nThe Metro reports that cigarettes will be targeted by the Chancellor in the Budget - revealing that a packet of twenty will go up to sixteen pounds as Mr Hunt steps up, what it describes as his \"war on smoking and vaping\".\nThe paper says he's planning to bring in a levy on liquids in e-cigarettes for importers and manufacturers to make the products unaffordable for children. It estimates the tax rise will bring in around half a billion pounds.\nThe i paper leads with a YouGov poll which shows - it says - that Labour is yet to convince forty per cent of its target voters to back the party ahead of a general election.

    "On the second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a mother and daughter living with sponsors near Hull, explain why they are preparing to risk their lives and return to their homeland. They say they are unable to afford to live independently in the UK, despite being in one of the least expensive areas of the country.\nFor Svitlana Nakonechna and her daughter Hanna, the pull of home is strong.\nDue to high living costs in Britain, they also feel a push; with both believing a home of their own in the UK is beyond their reach.\n\"It's very expensive here,\" says Svitlana, 41, explaining their decision to return to Ukraine in the summer. \"We had a target not to live on benefits, to find jobs. We did find jobs.\n\"But to live in this country, on our own, is not possible or realistic. We don't earn enough money to get our own place.\n\"We do not want to overstay our welcome [with the sponsors].\"\nSince arriving here on 18 March 2022, Svitlana and Hanna, 19, have been living with a couple they call their \"second family\" under the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme, in a village near Hull in East Yorkshire.\nThough at pains to stress they will forever be grateful to their \"amazing\" hosts and the UK, Svitlana and Hanna say they need independence after being forced to rely on the generosity of others for nearly two years.\nSvitlana, a hair stylist before the war, and Hanna work in a pub, both pot-washing.\nHanna combines her work with studying at East Riding College.\nI met them in Lena's Ukrainian Kitchen, a cafe in Hull city centre, where many who fled the war come for a taste of home.\nAs well as the UK cost of living crisis, mother and daughter say they are missing family who remain in Ukraine.\nOver coffee and a plate of mlyntsi - a type of pancake made with stewed apples - Svitlana and Hanna tell me they are aware of the risks associated with returning to Ukraine.\nNeither will forget the panic and destruction that arrived with the opening salvos of the conflict, as many expected Kyiv to be overrun.\n'Difficult decision'\n\"I realise it's dangerous,\" says Svitlana, speaking through an interpreter. \"I cannot deny I am scared. At the present moment, my decision is final.\"\nSvitlana recalls her life before the war.\n\"My life in Ukraine was good,\" she says. \"Myself and my husband had been building our own house. My husband had a business. We were very happy.\"\nRubbing her wedding ring, Svitlana tells me her husband died four months before the invasion.\nHanna, who dreams of one day becoming an actress, says she and her mother felt \"fear and disbelief\" when the Russians began their onslaught.\nWhen their neighbour's house was bombed, Svitlana made the \"difficult decision\" to leave.\nNeither woman wanted to move abroad. The situation dictated it, say the pair.\nOver the past two years, the women have made brief trips back to Ukraine to see Svitlana's parents and sisters.\nSoon, they will buy one-way tickets.\n\"Kyiv is still very beautiful,\" says Hanna who, like her mother, hankers for their homeland.\nHowever, the smiles vanish as she tells of changes they have noticed in the people each time they return.\n\"The main changes are in the people,\" says Hanna, now looking down at her coffee. \"People are more angry.\"\nShe adds: \"They are anxious.

His irreverence was often rightly directed at politicians, but never with rancour.\"\nConvener of Orkney Islands Council, Graham Bevan, said \"Dave was an expert at asking probing questions and regularly subjected elected members and officials to a grilling on air.\n\"It was in his chats with ordinary folk in Orkney, with a story to tell, that his talents most shone through.\n\"His love of Orkney - its history, its culture and its community - was clear.\"\nGray went on to run BBC Radio Orkney from 2008 until he retired in 2021.\nHe never lost touch with the station and remained a frequent voice on the airwaves.\nBBC Scotland News managing editor, Peter MacRae, said \"The Orkney audience took Dave to their hearts because he was the same person on air as off.\n\"He was passionate about Orkney and local journalism and a strong advocate for maintaining the BBC's commitment to Scotland's rural communities.\"",
    "Archivists believe they have worked out the date the World War Two bomb found in Plymouth was dropped on the city.\nA 309m (1,014ft) cordon has been set up after the German bomb was discovered in a garden in Keyham on Tuesday.\nStaff at The Box have revealed they think the 500kg (1,102lb) explosive fell during one of the heaviest nights of bombing in the city.\nUsing \"bomb maps\" from the war, the museum said it was dropped on 22 or 23 April, 1941.\nThe Box said 1,362 bombs exploded in the city during the war.\nStacey Anderson, media archivist at The Box, said the maps - which have been digitalised - show a line of bombs exploded in the St Thomas Avenue area, where the bomb was found, on those dates.\nThe maps show a couple of gaps along the route where the bombs were dropped by German aircraft, including one around where the cordon has been put up.\nMs Anderson said: \"This night was when that particular bomb fell.\"\nA Plymouth resident who lived in the city during the war said it was \"scary\" during the conflict, but the so-called \"blitz spirit\" kicked in quickly.\nNorah Hoskin was nine years old when German planes started dropping bombs on the city.\nShe said: \"It was very exciting, you could look up in the sky and all the flashlights were on and you could see the planes.\n\"It was scary at times, you heard the bangs and that.\n\"And you would go up and sometimes you would look and you'd think 'oh, where's that house gone?' and lucky you would think it's not our house, but it was your friend's house.\n\"But everybody rallied around and helped that person out.\"\n'Very drastic step'\nPlymouth City Council said more than 1,219 properties had been evacuated due to the bomb, and an estimated 3,250 people had been displaced.\nPlymouth Life Centre is being used as an emergency rest area for residents who have left their homes.\nThe council and Devon and Cornwall Police said a \"minimal\" number of residents have stayed in their homes despite being advised to leave.\nJemima Laing, the council's deputy leader, said: \"There are definitely conversations going on with all those people still to ask them to understand why we are asking them to take this very drastic step.\n\"I do understand, and of course we can't force people, but conversations are ongoing to really get people to understand why it would be the safest thing for them and their families.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

    "An unopened case of ice hockey cards found in a basement office has earned a family in Canada $3.1m USD ($4.2m CAD; \u00c2\u00a32.4m) at auction.\nInside there could be more than 20 \"rookie cards\" of Wayne Gretzky, one of the sport's greatest ever players.\nThe family who discovered the case hidden in their Saskatchewan office were \"ecstatic\" at the sale, an auction house spokesman said.\nThe winning bid was made by a Canadian who is choosing to stay anonymous.\nWith a 20% premium on top of the purchase, the final amount the Canadian bidder will pay is about $3.7m.\nHeritage Auctions, which is based in Dallas, called the discovery of the pristine 1979-80 cards from the now-defunct O-Pee-Chee candy and trading card brand, \"the greatest unopened find of the 21st Century\".\nThat characterisation is based on the valuable trading cards - Mr Gretzky's rookie card, in particular - that could be inside. Rookie cards are the first that depict an athlete as a professional player, and many collectors will pay a premium for them.\nAn individual Gretzky card can fetch anywhere from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Heritage Auctions sold one 1979 O-Pee-Chee card for $3.75m three years ago - a record.\nHeritage Auctions said in its lot description that because there are 396 cards in the set, there could be about 27 physically pristine Gretzky rookies inside the brown cardboard case.\n\"And, I mean, there's no guarantees, but it would be a pretty big statistical anomaly\" for it to deviate greatly from that number, said Jason Simonds, a sports cards specialist at Heritage\nThe family who had discovered the case \"hosted a small viewing party with close friends to watch the bids come in\", Mr Simonds said.\nThe dusty case was discovered when the father was clearing out his office in Regina with the help of his son, Mr Simonds told the BBC.\nThe father was an \"old-school collector\" who had bought the sealed case years ago intending to open it and build sets of cards to sell but simply never got around to it, he said. The family have asked to remain anonymous.\nCases like this one, which contain 16 boxes with 48 packs per box and 14 cards per pack and over 10,000 total cards, were originally intended to be sold to large stores who would open them and sell the individual packs to customers.\nBefore going to auction, all 16 wax boxes within the larger box were authenticated.",
    "Two twin sisters who have stuck together for the past 83 years have spoken of the incredible parallel lives they share.\nMargaret and Maureen Beckwith, who are identical, were evacuated to Northampton in 1940.\nThey both worked in the same place doing exactly the same job, often wear the same outfits and now live in adjacent streets of similar names.\nMargaret is the oldest, beating Maureen into the world by just five minutes.\nThe sisters both went to school in Main Road, Far Cotton and went on to Rothersthorpe Road Secondary School, because \"we weren't clever enough to pass the eleven plus\".\nThey both became machinists at Lincoln Models - a dress-making factory on Clarke Road in Northampton.\nThey also married, becoming Margaret Wright and Maureen Hallett.\nThe biggest difference in their lives is probably their families - while Margaret has six children, Maureen has one.\nMargaret's offspring have yet to have any twins of their own, but Maureen's son has teenage twins.\nThey have the same hair style, wear the same glasses and often put on the same clothes.\n'People used to stare'\nMargaret said, as a youngster, she did not want to be seen in the same outfit as her sister.\n\"I hated it because people used to stare,\" she said.\n\"She's even come down and knocked on my door, and I've looked and said, 'I shan't be a minute', and she's said, 'Where are you going?'.\n\"I said, 'To change my top because it's the same as the one you've got on'.\"\nNowadays they insist they do not contact each other to agree on an outfit, but end up dressed identically anyway.\nTheir twin telepathy does not just extend to clothing.\nMargaret said: \"She'll phone me up and say, 'How have you been today?', and I'll say, 'A bit iffy', and she'll say, 'I've not been very well', so she knew that I wasn't feeling 100% because she wasn't.\"\nEven though they do not live in the same place, they are not far from each other, with Margaret residing on Queen Eleanor Road and Maureen on Queen Eleanor Terrace. They also go to the same 'keep fit' class.\nMargaret married an identical twin, but Maureen decided not to follow suit and marry his brother.\nMaureen said: \"They were identical but they were different - they wasn't like us, thinking the same.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "President Joe Biden's dog Commander bit US Secret Service agents on at least 24 occasions, new documents show.\nSecret Service records show the extent to which the German Shepherd caused chaos for the presidential bodyguards.\nOne senior agent noted the bites meant the Secret Service changed tactics, advising agents to \"give lots of room\".\nThe warning came months before Commander was removed from the White House.\nThe documents were revealed through Freedom of Information requests and posted online. They are heavily redacted to protect the identity of Secret Service agents and secrecy of their security tactics.\nThey show at least 24 biting incidents took place between October 2022 and July 2023, including members of the Secret Service being bitten on the wrist, forearm, elbow, waist, chest, thigh and shoulder.\nThe documents do not necessarily record all biting incidents related to Commander, as they only cover the Secret Service and not others that work in the White House or staff at Camp David in Maryland.\nThe Biden family's pet left the White House in October last year, one week after a Secret Service agent required medical treatment for a severe bite.\nA previous incident in June led to a \"deep bite\" on the forearm of an agent, who needed stitches. Blood on the floor in an area of the White House caused tours of the East Wing of the building to be suspended for 20 minutes, according to one document.\nIn July, another agent was bitten in the hand and required six stitches. The bite caused a \"severe deep open wound\" and the agent \"started to lose a significant amount of blood\", one email showed.\nThis agent was given a \"small care package\" by colleagues as a present, including painkillers, antibiotic ointment, pepper spray, a muzzle and dog biscuits \"for safety purposes\".\nAn unnamed senior agent in one email advised that agents protecting Mr Biden and his family \"must be creative to ensure our own personal safety\".\n\"The recent dog bites have challenged us to adjust our operational tactics when Commander is present - please give lots of room (staying a terrain feature away if possible),\" the agent wrote.\nA statement to CNN from the office of First Lady Jill Biden said they had tried a number of measures to address the problem but gave up in the autumn and sent him to live with relatives.\n\"Despite additional dog training, leashing, working with veterinarians, and consulting with animal behaviourists, the White House environment simply proved too much for Commander,\" a statement said.\nAnother dog owned by the family, Major, injured a Secret Service agent in 2021 and was sent away to live in Delaware.",

Raising awareness of symptoms is another goal of the 25in25 scheme.\n'Extraordinary advances'\nLynn Mackay Thomas from the British Society of Heart Failure said: \"If we can reach people before they present at that point we can make a huge difference.\n\"There have been extraordinary advances in heart failure management over the last 20 years.\"\nShe added: \"Jersey represents quite a unique environment, a perfect microcosm, there is great work being done in Jersey and there is great communication across the island.\n\"And it could be a template for global rollout.\"\nDr Aaron Henry, a cardiology fellow at Jersey General hospital, said: \"Often we see people who think they have a bad chest infection for instance, and that's what's causing the breathlessness but actually it's heart failure.\n\"So we want to do is increase awareness amongst health care professionals and patients.\n\"So we use the acronym BEAT- Breathlessness, exhaustion, ankle swelling, time for a blood test.\n\"That's the message we want to spread across the island.\"\nDr Pierre Le Page, Consultant Cardiologist at Jersey General hospital says a diagnosis doesn't need to be bad news for islanders anymore.\n\"People are living longer and feeling better,\" he said.\n\"So the expectation for islanders is that a diagnosis for heart failure is a good thing because we know the symptoms and can make you feel better.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook .

    "Residents have been returning to an evacuated Bristol tower block following work to make the building safe again.\nMore than 250 adults and children were evacuated from Barton House in November after concerns about its safety in the event of a fire or explosion.\nBristol City Council have now asked residents to return by 17:00 GMT on Friday following the go-ahead from structural engineers.\nDetailed survey reports confirm the building follows safety specifications.\nAn initial investigation was undertaken into nine flats in key structural locations\u00c2\u00a0around the building.\nWork then was carried out on 37 flats to fire-proof them and a new central fire alarm system has been put in place, as well as new fire alarms installed in all 98 flats.\nSurvey reports from Ridge and Partners LLP and Arup, together with assurance from Avon Fire and Rescue Service, confirm that Barton House is now safe for residents to return.\nSome tenants still fear returning to the tower block over structural safety concerns, worried that the same thing could happen again without warning.\nHowever, some are glad to be back in their own homes after an unsettling period of living in hotels paid for by the council.\nJon Wisbey, chair of the tenants association, said he was \"relieved\" to be returning home after staying in what he called the \"Helliday\" Inn.\n\"Personally I'm glad to be back. It's my home and I've been here 23 years,\" he said.\n\"There are some people that are really glad to be back, there are others that are really apprehensive about it.

    "A six-month inquiry into plans by Gatwick Airport to use its emergency runway for routine flights has begun.\nThe airport hopes to double capacity to 78 million passengers by making use of its existing northern runway.\nIt said plans would create 14,000 jobs and provide a \u00c2\u00a31bn economic boost - but campaigners have voiced opposition.\nBefore the inquiry in Crawley, 10 councils have also raised concerns that the proposals will not ensure noise and air quality levels are not exceeded.\nIn a joint statement on Monday, the authorities surrounding the airport added: \"We also do not consider that the transport network has the capacity to meet the sustainable needs that will arise from the almost doubling of passengers using the airport.\n\"We have been working together to ensure that if the proposal were to be approved, the required controls, mitigations and where appropriate, compensations are put in place to limit the environmental impacts and to maximise the economic and community benefits.\"\nGatwick's chief executive, Stewart Wingate, previously told the BBC the existing main runway was routinely used for all landings and take-offs.

    "When Joe Biden became president, he promised to undo the strict immigration policies of Donald Trump and take a more \"humane\" approach.\nDespite some successes in changing policies, Mr Biden's wider efforts to reform the country's immigration system have stalled, crushed under the weight of record-breaking numbers of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border.\nImmigration is now a massive political headache for Mr Biden, as well as a political threat, with more than two-thirds of Americans saying they disapprove of his handling of the border.\nHis predecessor, and potential rival for the White House in November's election, Mr Trump, has seized on the discontent in his current presidential campaign.\nMr Biden has been forced to pivot and move closer to the approaches Mr Trump took in office.\nLet's take a look at the top border issues and where Mr Biden and Mr Trump's policies are different, and similar.\nAsylum\nUnder current law, any foreign national arriving to the US can claim asylum. But both the Biden and Trump administrations have sought to control the number of those making that claim through policies such as the Covid-era Title 42 and the \"Remain in Mexico\" programme.\nDuring his successful White House bid, Mr Biden campaigned against Mr Trump's restrictive asylum policies, particularly the \"transit ban\" that forbade migrants from applying for asylum unless they first applied before they reached the US border.\nFaced with mounting criticism, however, the Biden administration and Democratic allies have suggested asylum provisions similar to Mr Trump's.\nA stalled bipartisan border bill, for example, would have tightened asylum restrictions and created daily limits on border crossings. Once that capped was reached, asylum seekers would have been turned away.\nMr Biden said the bill would have allowed him to \"shut down\" the border when overwhelmed - a drastic change in tone from his campaign.\nAnother Biden administration rule also means that large numbers of migrants are ineligible to claim asylum if they arrive illegally at border points between ports of entry.\nParole\nThe Biden and Trump administrations have mostly differed when it comes to parole, where the government allows migrants into the US even if they don't have a visa, or can't qualify for one.\nWhile parole authority has existed since the 1950s, it has been used substantially more during the Biden administration, prompting ferocious criticism from Republicans and Mr Trump.\nThis includes the humanitarian parole of migrants who have been detained  - particularly when they are found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture in their home country.\nThere are also special, targeted parole programmes for people of specific nationalities, including Afghans and Ukrainians.\nAs many as 30,000 migrants a a month are able to fly to the US legally on parole under the programme for Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians, sparking a lawsuit from some Republican-led states who say it is illegal.\nThe scrapped border bill would have kept these programmes in place and allowed parole for those in humanitarian need, but broadly speaking would have restricted its use.\nDeportations\nWhen President Biden took office, there was a change of tone and of policy from Mr Trump's administration when it came to deportation, leading to a sharp decline in the number of people being removed from the US.\nAdditionally, the Biden administration swiftly moved to end the arrest and deportation of migrants in the US interior, a sharp departure from the Trump administration's practices.\nThe number of deportations has steadily risen since the beginning of the administration, but experts say that is due to high numbers of arrivals at the border rather than increased enforcement in the US.\nThis has been a key difference between between the two administrations. But the gap may be narrowing slightly, with Mr Biden reportedly mulling executive actions to fast-track deportations for recent arrivals, particularly for those who don't qualify for asylum.\nMr Trump, for his part, has vowed to carry out the \"largest deportation operation\" in US history to remove undocumented migrants already in the country if he returns to the White House.\nHe has said he will use the National Guard to carry out his plans, which would come up against legal limits on using US military forces to enforce domestic laws.\nBorder Walls\nBuilding a border wall was a signature policy of Donald Trump as president and was fiercely opposed by Democrats, including Mr Biden, who vowed to not build \"another foot of wall\" when he took office.\nIn October, however, Mr Biden came under fire from both Republicans and Democrats after his administration announced new border wall construction in Texas. Some 20 miles (32km) of barriers will be built in a sparsely populated stretch of the Rio Grande Valley.\nMr Biden said he \"had no choice\" because funding for the construction was signed off on while Mr Trump was president.\n\"I tried to g",

He has not commented on the charges.\nPolice divers are combing waterholes about 185km (115 miles) from Sydney.\nThey say Mr Lamarre-Condon, 28, may have left the pair's bodies on the remote Bungonia property, after moving them in a white hire van from the alleged murder scene in Mr Baird's home.\nOn Monday, New South Wales Police said the suspected killer had taken \"an acquaintance\" to the Bungonia property last Wednesday.\nAfter severing a lock on a gate, Mr Lamarre-Condon then left the female acquaintance there before driving the van on to the property and returning 30 minutes later, police said.\nShe \"wasn't aware the bodies were in the vehicle\" and has been co-operating with detectives, Deputy Commissioner David Hudson said.\nHe added that police were investigating whether Mr Lamarre-Condon had later returned and moved the bodies again.\nThe suspect had bought an angle grinder and weights from separate stores last Wednesday, the deputy commissioner said.\nMr Hudson also said that in the hours after the alleged killings, Mr Lamarre-Condon had sent messages from Mr Baird's phone telling his friends he was moving to Western Australia.\nNew South Wales Police have previously said a bullet matching Mr Lamarre-Condon's work-issued gun was found inside Mr Baird's house, along with a \"significant\" amount of blood.\nThe suspect was charged after taking himself to a Sydney police station on Friday.\nThe case is believed to be the first suspected murder carried out by a New South Wales police officer in decades, and it has prompted an independent review into police officers' out-of-hours access to firearms.\nMr Baird had been a presenter and red carpet reporter on Network 10's morning show Studio 10 until the programme was axed in December, while Mr Davies was a flight attendant for Qantas.\nMr Lamarre-Condon joined the police force in 2019 and was previously a celebrity blogger who had met stars including Taylor Swift, Harry Styles and Miley Cyrus.",

    "Bradford Council has agreed to repay several social housing tenants after they were overcharged on rent.\nA review of the council's housing revenue account identified that some rents and service charges had been calculated incorrectly.\nThe mistake meant that 259 tenants had been overcharged by a total of \u00c2\u00a3344,000.\nThe council apologised for the error and said it was \"working hard\" to contact those affected to refund them.\nThe error, which had affected tenants since April 2020, has since been rectified, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service .\nOne issue identified by the report was that, in some cases, service charges had been added on top of affordable rents, instead of being included in them.\nThe report also found that some properties had not been revalued before new tenants moved in, which meant that rent was calculated incorrectly.\n'Immediate and robust action'\nA process has been put in place to identify the tenants and former tenants who had been overcharged, which the council hoped would be done by the end of March.\nHowever, the report warned of delays concerning tenants who had moved out of its properties.\n\"The process of tracing former tenants may in some cases be lengthy, as it is not always immediately possible to ascertain current whereabouts,\" it said.\n\"In the case of deceased former tenants, refunds to the deceased's estate or beneficiary will be arranged.\"\nCouncillor Alex Ross-Shaw, Bradford Council's Executive Member for Planning, Transport and Regeneration, apologised to those affected.\nHe said: \"As soon as the council became aware of this issue, council officers took professional advice, referred the council to the Regulator of Social Housing and undertook immediate and robust action to remedy the situation.\n\"We sincerely apologise to any tenants who were incorrectly charged, and the council is working hard to contact everyone affected to refund them.\"\nDetails of the overcharging would be given at a meeting of Bradford Council's Executive next Tuesday.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Australian police say two bodies have been found during the search for missing Sydney couple Jesse Baird and Luke Davies.\n\"We are very confident that we have located Luke and Jesse,\" New South Wales (NSW) Police Commissioner Karen Webb said.\nBeaumont Lamarre-Condon, a police officer who once dated TV presenter Mr Baird, was earlier charged with murder.\nThe bodies were discovered on a rural property in the town of Bungonia.\nPolice said that after initially refusing to cooperate with the investigation, Mr Lamarre-Condon finally disclosed where the two bodies were located on Tuesday morning.\nDetective Superintendent Daniel Doherty said the remains were found \"near the entrance to the property\" and that attempts had been made \"to cover the bodies with rock and debris\".\nHe added that police believe two \"surf bags\" were used to transport the deceased couple in a white van from Mr Baird's inner city Paddington home, where it is believed they were killed.\nInvestigators found a bullet matching Mr Lamarre-Condon's work-issued gun there last week, along with a \"significant\" amount of blood and upturned furniture.\nMr Lamarre-Condon, who appeared in court on Friday and was refused bail, has not commented on the charges against him. He first joined the police force in 2019 and was previously a celebrity blogger.\nPolice began focusing their efforts on a Bungonia property - some two hours south of Sydney - after learning Mr Lamarre-Condon had visited it in the white van believed to be carrying the pair's bodies with an acquaintance last Wednesday. The acquaintance has been described by police as \"an innocent agent\".\nAfter severing a lock on a gate, Mr Lamarre-Condon then left the female acquaintance there before driving the van on to the property and returning 30 minutes later. Police had been investigating whether Mr Lamarre-Condon then returned to the location to move the bodies.\nAnd on Tuesday, Mr Lamarre-Condon told detectives the remains were located at another property in the same town.\nThe case - which has gripped Australia - is believed to be the first suspected murder carried out by a New South Wales police officer in decades, and it has prompted a review into the out-of-hours access officers have to their firearms.\nIt has also led organisers of Sydney's iconic Mardi Gras parade to uninvite NSW police from this year's march, a decision which has sparked fierce debate online and disappointment from police, who allege the murders were a crime of \"passion\" not \"gay-hate related\".\nSydney's Mardi Gras parade has a complex history of both LGBT activism and police brutality, after the first march in 1978 resulted in dozens of people being beaten and arrested by local officers.\nIn the decades since though it has been a unifying event, with uniformed police taking part every year since 1998.\nTributes have flooded in for Mr Baird, a former presenter and red carpet reporter, and Mr Davies, who worked as a flight attendant for Qantas.\n\"Obviously Jesse and Luke were very much an active part of the community and I look at their photos online and know they had a great life,\" Commissioner Webb said.",
    "When writer and theatre director Clare Duffy started to explore the world of incels, she had no idea what she was letting herself in for.\nWithin days she was pulled into the dark side of an anti-female culture.\nIncel is short for \"involuntary celibate\", a member of a misogynistic culture which has amassed a following online.\nIt has hit headlines due to the arrest of online personality and self-declared misogynist Andrew Tate.\nBut ideologies based on distrust and hatred towards women have been gaining space in the mainstream over the past decade through online channels, especially social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok.\nTo find out more, Clare set up an internet identity as a 23-year-old man called Clive and posed the question - how do I get a girlfriend?\nWithin an hour she'd received a barrage of messages.\n\"They started off quite benign,\" she says.\n\"Like you need to have a shower, eat right, take exercise. Then it becomes you need to be brave, to be strong, to be powerful, you need to take control of the space and the situation, and gradually the messages become more and more about power and dominance.\"\nA few days later, she found the messages had become even darker.\nThey referred to \"pills\" which are used in incel ideology to denote progress in radicalisation.\nThe concept was first used in the film The Matrix in which Neo, played by Keanu Reeves is offered a choice between a red pill which allows him to question his surroundings, or a blue pill which allows him to continue in a simulated world.\nIncel culture also refers to a \"black pill\" which is much more nihilistic. Men believe that women and society are biased against them and there is no hope of them ever finding love or acceptance.\n\"Those messages were basically about accepting that you'll never get a girlfriend, and you may as well lay down and rot - LDAR,\" she said.\n\"You start to understand the reasoning behind incel violence. It's very rare but that journey from a bit of sexism that is so common it won't be called out, to real hatred to real self hatred is one we wanted to explore.\"\nClare then went on to explore the responses \"Clive\" received in two workshops with teenagers, aged between 15 and 18.\nThe workshops were split into teen boys and teen girs.\nShe said the teens told of pornography being used secretly in the classroom, and \"not being able to get away from these constant messages of how to be a man, how to be a woman\nClare continued: \"The young women were really aware of a lot of misogyny that was online which was slipping into their real world.\n\"For the young men, it was all about football. They get their cues for what it means to be a man from the football players they watch.\"\nThe company were wary about allowing the young people to be interviewed but they gathered some statements.\n\"It was eye-opening to learn what [incels] are and what they do. I think if people knew more they could stop people going down that rabbit hole,\" said one of the young women.\n\"I knew quite a bit but only on surface level. I think it's really prevalent because it's online and not really regulated,\" said another.\nOne 15-year-old boy said: \"I now understand the severity and how it can be taken to extremes. It's an important project because I don't think we know that much about it.\"\nSafeguarding obligations\nClare's company Civic Digits approached Hearts Football Club about staging their show Many Good Men inside Tynecastle Stadium.\n\"It's a really important issue, and a scary one and important for us with the safeguarding obligations we have with the young men in our football academy, for them to understand some of the risks and dangers they have in this space.\" says Hearts CEO Andrew McKinley.\nAnd he believes it can have positive benefits for the club, and the male-dominated world of football.\n\"We are seeing a change in the demographic and the upsurge in our women's team. There's no doubt on match day it's still male dominated so it would be great to see some younger girls. We want everyone to feel welcome and to feel like it's a safe space for them.\"\nThe show, which begins its second run this week, invites an audience to take part in an immersive and interactive performance around Tynecastle Stadium, where they are instrumental in the outcome.\nEach show starts with the same premise - there's been an incel shooting in Edinburgh and two footballers are trying to find out more about the culture around it.\nThe performances are free to locals, schools and youth groups, but the project doesn't stop there. The workshops with young people will be used for research on online incel culture in Scotland.\nClare hopes the project it can tour around Scotland, and further afield.\n\"The performance is just one stage,\" she said.\n\"We hope the research will have an impact for policy makers and we've already agreed to take it further afield to Romania.\"\n\"This show is a way of experiencing the internet together. We usually experience it on our own. We all react differently to co",
    "More potential victims have been urged to come forward after a man was jailed for raping a girl he met on Snapchat.\nRhodri Llyr Griffiths, 28, contacted the 13-year-old in 2023, using a fake profile and sent her sexual messages.\nGriffiths, of Highland Gardens, Neath Abbey, was jailed for 10-and-a-half years after admitting sexual communication with a child, rape and other sexual offences.\nGwent Police said he had messaged other girls using fake names such as James.\nOn Thursday, Newport Crown Court heard his victim said she felt like her life had been \"destroyed\".\nGriffiths was emotionless as Judge Daniel Williams told him he did not \"accept for a moment you have any regret or remorse for what you did\".\nGriffiths offered the girl money and alcohol to carry out sexual acts on him and sent her a video of someone else that he pretended was him.\nHis victim told him where she lived and he offered to come and pick her up and it was only when she got into the car that she discovered that Griffiths was much older than he claimed.\nShe asked him to stop the car, but he refused and drove several miles to a car park where he told her to get in the back of his car.\nJudge Williams said \"she was so fearful if she didn't you may kill her\" and the young girl \"tried to get away but you screamed at her to stop\".\nWhen the attack was over, Griffiths drove the girl home. Within days, the girl told her mother and Griffiths was arrested.\nInitially, he lied to police, saying there had been sexual contact but not sex.\nIn a victim impact statement, the girl's mother told the court that it was \"every parent's nightmare\".\nShe said her daughter scrubbed her skin until it was raw following the attack and had taken an overdose.\n\"As a mother, I can't fix her or take her pain away. That is torture,\" she added.\nThe girl's victim impact statement said: \"Every time I look in a mirror I see him looking back at me like he did that night.\"\nShe said she had changed her appearance, and did not feel safe leaving home, adding: \"I will never trust another man again\".\nJudge Williams described the girl's statement as \"heartbreaking\".\nHe told Griffiths that he presented \"a high risk of serious harm\" to girls and it was necessary to impose an extended sentence to protect the public.\nThe girl's family wept as the judge said that Griffiths planned the attack and had inflicted \"severe psychological harm\" on her.\nAs well as his prison sentence, Griffiths was given an extended licence period of five years and a sexual harm prevention order and restraining order were also imposed.\nGwent Police believe there are more victims and are appealing to anyone who they believe is a victim of Griffiths to contact them.\nDet Con Georgia Dunne said: \"Rhodri Griffiths is a dangerous man, and we welcome the sentence provided by the courts and hope that he uses this time to reflect on his actions.\"\nA Snapchat spokesperson said after the hearing: \"Any sexual exploitation of young people is abhorrent and our hearts go out to the victim in this case.\n\"We work in multiple ways to detect and prevent this type of abuse, offer confidential in-app reporting tools, and work with police to support investigations.\n\"We have extra protections in place for under-18s, including a pop-up warning that alerts teens if they are contacted by someone who they don't know.\n\"Our Family Centre tool also lets parents know if their teens add a new friend, and allows them to see who their teens are talking to.\"",
    "US burger chain Wendy's has denied it is exploring plans to raise prices on customers at busy moments, claiming its plans were \"misconstrued\".\nThe firm had told investors this month that it was rolling out digital menu displays at its restaurants and expected to start testing features \"like dynamic pricing\" early next year.\nThe term refers to the practice of rapidly changing posted prices.\nThe plans quickly drew backlash and accusations of \"price gouging\".\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Wendy's said the goal of the digital menu boards was to provide \"more flexibility to change the display of featured items\", including promoting discounts during slow periods.\n\"This was misconstrued in some media reports as an intent to raise prices when demand is highest at our restaurants. We have no plans to do that and would not raise prices when our customers are visiting us most,\" the company said.\nIt added that it had never used the phrase \"surge pricing\", as articles describing the comments by boss Kirk Tanner had.\nThe term \"surge pricing\" was popularised by Uber, which has long charged higher fares during busy periods.\nThe practice is also common in areas such as airlines and hotels and it is becoming more widely adopted as technology makes it easier to automate the changes.\nIn the UK, the Stonegate Group, a major pub chain that owns Slug & Lettuce and Yates bars, said last year it was raising prices during peak hours.\nThe idea that Wendy's, which claims more than 6,500 restaurants globally, might adopt a similar strategy sparked outrage online, where many people said they would simply take their business elsewhere.\nLeft-wing Senator Elizabeth Warren was one of the most high-profile critics, saying on Wednesday that the plans meant people \"could pay more for your lunch, even if the cost to Wendy's stays exactly the same\".\n\"It's price gouging plain and simple, and American families have had enough,\" she wrote on X , formerly Twitter.",
    "Ukrainians who moved to Keighley to escape the war have marked the second anniversary of Russia's invasion.\nSince arriving in the town, about 100 women and children refugees have been supported by Keighley's Ukrainian Cultural and Community Centre.\nOn Friday, many joined a vigil to mark two years since the start of the war.\nIryna Cyhanko, who helped organise support for the refugees in Keighley, said: \"I don't like to call them displaced persons. They are family.\"\nJoining the vigil, organised by the Association of Ukrainians Keighley branch and held at St Andrew's Church, was Viktoriia Sydoruk, from Odessa.\nShe was one of those who fled Ukraine following the Russian invasion on 24 February 2022 and she came alone to West Yorkshire.\nMs Sydoruk said her parents had encouraged her to leave for the UK to have a chance at happiness.\n\"My mama looked at me and she couldn't say any words. She just looked and I understood what she meant,\" she said.\n\"They are older people, and they had a life before. They had a family, children, and a life.\n\"But I am young and I didn't have the same life that they had before.\"\nTwo years on, Ms Sydoruk's memories of the start of the invasion remain stark.\nShe said when the air raid sirens sounded over Odessa, she and her family retreated to her basement, then fled to a refugee centre with just her cat and some bottles of water.\nShe left the country shortly afterwards, but her brother, Dennis, stayed to fight - only to be badly injured when he was hit by a Russian drone.\n\"When people have injuries like my brother has had, they usually don't survive,\" Ms Sydoruk said.\n\"I am really proud. He is like a hero for us.\"\nAs refugees began arriving in Keighley following the invasion, Ms Cyhanko, a second generation Ukrainian in West Yorkshire, became a lynchpin.\nShe began weekly gatherings at the Ukrainian Cultural and Community Centre to help and support those who had left their war-torn homeland behind.\nMs Cyhanko said: \"What we've done for them was lacking when our parents came over. So, we wanted this transitional help for these people.\"\nShe added that she understood all too clearly what it must be like for those who had left Ukraine since the Russian invasion and come to Keighley.\n\"You settle here in body, but your head is still with family or loved ones in Ukraine,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "The National Rifle Association and two top executives have been found liable in a civil corruption trial and ordered to repay $6.35m (\u00c2\u00a35m).\nA New York jury agreed that former leader Wayne LaPierre cost the gun rights group millions of dollars through lavish spending on himself.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James accused the NRA and Mr LaPierre of violating state laws.\nMr LaPierre stepped down from his job just before the trial began.\nOn Friday, the jury found that Mr LaPierre cost the group a total of $5.4m, of which slightly more than $1m has already been repaid. He must now pay back $4.35m.\nFormer NRA finance chief Wilson \"Woody\" Phillips, general counsel John Frazer and the NRA itself were co-defendants.\nMr Phillips was ordered to repay $2m.\nMr LaPierre, 74, who was the NRA chief executive for more than 30 years, was in court and reacted impassively to the verdict.\nMr Frazer was found not to have cost the organisation financially, and the jury did not order him to repay any money.\nThe NRA said the verdict confirmed what it \"contended all along - that it was victimised by certain former vendors and 'insiders' who abused the trust placed in them by the association\".\nIt also noted the group does not have to pay any financial penalties and that the jury found no cause to remove Mr Frazer, the sole defendant who still works at the NRA.\nThe gun lobbying organisation added that it has in recent years adopted new policies and accounting controls.\nMs James said after the trial that Mr LaPierre and the NRA were \"finally being held accountable for this rampant corruption and self-dealing\".\nThe New York attorney general originally sought to have the NRA dissolved outright when her office filed the lawsuit in 2020, but a judge blocked that move.\nIn the trial, defence attorneys for the three men and the NRA sought to portray the proceedings as a \"baseless, premeditated attack\" and politically motivated \"witch hunt\" by Ms James, a Democrat.\nBut during closing arguments, assistant attorney general Monica Connell said the NRA, a registered charity, should have spent the funds on its primary mission, rather than on lavish expenses.\n\"Saying you're sorry now, saying maybe you'll put back a couple of those cookies, doesn't mean you didn't take the cookies,\" Ms Connell said.\nOver the course of the six-week trial, prosecutors detailed specific expenses that they said showed Mr LaPierre and other executives had used NRA funds as their \"personal piggy bank\".\nMr LaPierre visited the Bahamas more than eight times by private plane using funds intended for the NRA, for a total cost of $500,000.\nThe evidence also included helicopter trips to car races to avoid being stuck in traffic, as well as money spent on landscaping and anti-mosquito treatments at Mr LaPierre's home.\nThere were also gifts for friends and family and expenses such as hair and makeup styling for Mr LaPierre's wife.\nThe judge must now determine - without a jury - whether independent monitors and experts will be installed to oversee the NRA's charitable assets and administration.\nThough based in Virginia, the NRA is incorporated in New York City.\nThe attorney general's Charities Bureau is responsible for oversight of any non-profit organisation.\nFounded in 1871 as a recreational group designed to \"promote and encourage rifle shooting\", the NRA has grown into one of the most powerful political organisations in the US.",
    "The UK has announced more than 50 further sanctions against Russia ahead of the second anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine.\nThe sanctions target individuals and businesses sustaining Russian President Vladimir Putin's war effort.\nForeign Secretary Lord David Cameron said the UK would continue to back Kyiv \"for as long as it takes\".\nIt follows the sanctions imposed on six Russian prison bosses after the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\nThe Foreign Office said the latest sanctions would crack down on those supplying Russia's military with munitions such as rocket launch systems, missiles and explosives.\nThe sanctions also target key sources of Russian revenue, clamping down on metals, diamonds and the energy trade, in a move designed to cut off funding for President Putin's war efforts from every angle, officials said.\nAnnouncing the new measures, Lord Cameron said: \"Our international economic pressure means Russia cannot afford this illegal invasion.\n\"Our sanctions are starving Putin of the resources he desperately needs to fund his struggling war.\n\"Together, we will not let up in the face of tyranny. We will continue to support Ukraine as it fights for democracy - for as long as it takes.\"\nAmong those sanctioned are oil trader Niels Troost, and his company Paramount Energy and Commodities SA, and Pavel Alekseevich Marinychev, the new CEO of Alrosa, the largest state-owned Russian diamond producer.\nSeveral foreign companies have also been targeted for their part in facilitating Russia's war effort, the Foreign Office said.\nSaturday marks the second anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThe conflict is largely at a stalemate, though Moscow appears to have made recent advances . Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly urged western allies to provide more weapons or risk emboldening Russia's forces.\nThe EU is working on its own package of measures to coincide with the anniversary of the war.\nThe British sanctions come a day after the Foreign Office announced it had frozen the assets and implemented a travel ban on Russian prison bosses in charge of the penal colony where Alexei Navalny died.\nThe measures faced criticism from some corners for not going far enough.\nThe government says it has sanctioned 2,000 individuals, companies and groups under its Russia sanctions regime.\nThe US has also pledged fresh sanctions on Russia following Navalny's death, expected to come later this week.\nNavalny, who was the Russian opposition's most significant leader for the last decade, had been serving a 19-year sentence on charges many viewed as politically motivated.\nThe Russian prison service said he died at the IK-3 Arctic penal colony, nicknamed \"Polar Wolf\", on Friday of last week after taking a walk and suddenly collapsing.\nNavalny's team alleges he was murdered on the orders of President Putin.

    "In the 19th Century, Europeans realised what the Inca had known long before. Bird droppings, or guano, made a fantastic fertiliser.\nAnd so sprang up a gigantic industry dedicated to the harvesting of guano from Latin American bird colonies, where there were huge piles of the stuff.\nIt was so rich in ammonia, the key ingredient, that a mere whiff could induce coughing and sneezing. Not exactly a pleasant cargo to ferry across the world.\nAs demand for fertiliser rose in the early 1900s, someone began to think, \"Perhaps there's another way?\" That someone was Fritz Haber, a German chemist who, along with Carl Bosch, developed the Haber-Bosch process for synthesising ammonia.\nWe have relied on that technology for more than 100 years. Without it, the world's population might be just half of what it is today - so vital is ammonia fertiliser for growing food.\nBut yet again, someone is asking whether we should do things differently because the Haber-Bosch process, when powered by fossil fuels, is notoriously polluting.\nAmmonia production currently accounts for nearly 2% of global CO2 emissions. Now, a string of companies aim to prove that they can make green ammonia, or alternatives, without wrecking the climate.\n\"We have a well-sealed system, you don't smell it,\" says Joe Beach, reassuringly. He is co-founder and chief executive of Starfire Energy, a US-based firm that is developing a means of producing ammonia from renewable energy, air and water. But, he argues, the pungency of ammonia is actually a benefit. If there's a leak, you'll soon know.\nAmmonia, or NH3, is nothing more than nitrogen and hydrogen, both highly abundant elements. Earth's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, and water is full of hydrogen. Starfire Energy uses electrolysers to split hydrogen from water and then feed it into a reactor along with nitrogen to make their ammonia.\nThe ingredients flow through a honeycomb structure laced with a catalyst - similar to the catalytic converter in your car's exhaust. This device encourages nitrogen to bond with hydrogen, and liquid ammonia is collected at the end of the process.\nCrucially, the whole thing can, says Mr Beach, run on intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar. \"For a conventional ammonia plant to go from cold to full output is a two- to three-day process,\" he says. \"For us, it's about a two-hour process.\"\nOnce started, the system can cycle on and off in a matter of minutes, following the vagaries of renewables. Starfire Energy aims to deliver its first commercial-scale devices, which could produce a tonne of ammonia per day, in 2025.\nIn general, green ammonia start-ups want to show that they can make ammonia production cleaner and easier to control. Plus, many, including Starfire Energy, hope to package the required tech in a space as small as a shipping container, so that it can be made near to the point of use - quite unlike the gargantuan Haber-Bosch plants operating today.\n\"We do want to make fertiliser on a small scale so we can use it more efficiently,\" says Lea Winter at Yale University. Cutting the need to transport ammonia fertiliser over long-distances could further reduce emissions, she notes.\nAnother firm, Atmonia in Iceland, also wants to sell mini ammonia factories that fit inside shipping containers. Helga Flosad\u00c3\u00b3ttir, co-founder and chief executive, points out that while decarbonising fertiliser production is important, an even bigger goal lies in producing enough ammonia to use it as a fuel. That could help the world move away from fossil fuels for transportation, for example.\nDouglas MacFarlane at Monash University in Australia is also chief scientific officer of Jupiter Ionics. He agrees that there is huge interest in ammonia as a fuel, though he adds that production would have to scale up significantly to be able to meet expected demand. \"Those plants would have to be, ultimately, on the gigawatt scale,\" he says.\nMore technology of business\nJupiter Ionics is currently planning to build an ammonia production module on the megawatt scale, which could produce a tonne per day.\nJupiter Ionics' technology differs from Starfire Energy and Atmonia's in that it uses lithium as a mediator to break apart nitrogen molecules, which naturally exist as strongly bonded pairs of nitrogen atoms, to form lithium nitride. This then reacts with hydrogen to make the ammonia.\nWithin the next 12-18 months, Jupiter Ionics aims to scale up its equipment so that it can produce a kilogram of ammonia per day. A grape farmer in the state of Victoria who has solar panels on his land is hoping to trial the system, says Prof MacFarlane.\nAs Prof Winter notes, it's the successful scaling up of these technologies that will likely present the biggest challenge for these firms.\nThere are other options. As Josh McEnaney, president and chief technology officer of Nitricity in the US, explains, spreading ammonia on fields results in greenhouse gas emissions that could be avoided if we took a more direct a",

    "Almost two million people in Gaza - most of the population - are reported to have fled their homes since Israel began its military operation in response to Hamas's deadly attacks of 7 October.\nThe Strip has been under the control of Hamas since 2007 and Israel says it is trying to destroy the military and governing capabilities of the Islamist group, which is committed to the destruction of Israel.\nGaza - a densely populated enclave 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and fenced off from Israel and Egypt at its borders - has \"simply become uninhabitable\", according to United Nations officials.\nIsrael warned civilians to evacuate the area of Gaza north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed, ahead of its invasion in the weeks after the Hamas attack.\nThe evacuation area included Gaza City - which was the most densely populated area of the Gaza Strip. The Erez border crossing into Israel in the north is closed, so those living in the evacuation zone had no choice but to head towards the southern districts.\nSouthern Gaza evacuation areas\nAfter an intense bombing campaign and ground invasion into northern Gaza and Gaza City, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have refocused operations on southern Gaza. The main urban areas in the south - Khan Younis and Rafah - have been bombed and Israeli troops have clashed with Hamas fighters on the ground. Palestinians, including those who fled fighting in the north, had been told to move to a so-called \"safe area\" at al-Mawasi, a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast, close to the Egyptian border.\nFighting in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah has already pushed tens of thousands of people to flee to the southern district of Rafah, the UN said, where more than one million people \"are squeezed into an extremely overcrowded space\".\nAccording to the UN, just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - were already registered refugees before Israel warned Palestinians to leave northern Gaza.\nPalestinian refugees are defined by the UN as people whose \"place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 War\". More than 500,000 of the refugee population lived in eight crowded camps located across the Strip.\nFollowing Israel's warnings after 7 October, many of those refugees joined the hundreds of thousands of people forced to flee their homes, the UN says.\nAbout 1.7 million Palestinians are now gathered in emergency shelters or informal sites set up nearby.\nOn average, before the conflict, there were more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - very similar to the average density in London - but that figure was more than 9,000 in Gaza City, the most heavily populated area. The UN says more than half of Gaza's population is now crammed into Rafah - a town of originally 250,000 people.\n\"Their living conditions are abysmal - they lack the basic necessities to survive, stalked by hunger, disease and death,\" according to the UN's relief co-ordinator Martin Griffiths.\nThe UN warns that overcrowding has become a major concern in its emergency shelters in central and southern Gaza, with some far exceeding their capacity.\nMany of these emergency shelters are schools and in some there are dozens of people living in a single classroom. Other families are living in tents or makeshift shelters in compounds or on open areas of waste ground.\nAreas of new tents that sprung up close to the Egyptian border between the start of December and middle of January cover roughly 3.5 sq km, equivalent to nearly 500 Premier League football pitches.\nThe satellite images, captured on 15 October and 14 January, show a dramatic change - now nearly every patch of accessible, undeveloped ground in an area of north-west Rafah has been turned into a refuge for displaced people.\nEven before the current conflict, about 80% of the population of Gaza was in need of humanitarian aid, and although Israel has been allowing some aid in from Egypt, aid agencies say it is nowhere near enough.\nThey say that half of Gaza's population is starving and most of the population regularly go without food for a whole day.  Save the Children said people were being forced to forage for scraps of food left by rats and eat leaves out of desperation to survive.\nA seven-day ceasefire at the end of November allowed agencies to deliver an average of 170 trucks and 110,000 litres of fuel a day, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says. The daily average is now about 76.\nAid trucks are still crossing into Gaza, but the WHO has warned that delivering that aid \"continues to face near insurmountable challenges\" as the area endures intense bombardment, movement restrictions, interrupted communications and fuel shortages.\nIsrael has already launched hundreds of airstrikes across Gaza.

    "The delivery of major public infrastructure projects in Northern Ireland will cost almost \u00c2\u00a32.5bn more than planned, a spending watchdog has warned.\nThe Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO) analysed 77 projects across various Stormont departments.\nThey were originally estimated to cost \u00c2\u00a35.63bn but that has increased by 44% to \u00c2\u00a38.08bn.\nMost of the additional cost relates to 11 major projects.\nThe auditor general, Dorinnia Carville, said some of the increased costs reflected \"significant external factors\", including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and inflation.\nHowever, she added that it was \"extremely concerning\" that, more than four years after her last report on this issue, there was little evidence of improvement or lessons learned being applied to new projects.\nThese include weaknesses in procurement and accountability.\nThe report looks at the executive's seven \"flagship\" projects which were first identified in 2015.\nThey are:\nThe Glider is the only one of the seven projects to be completed, although most of the A6 has been delivered. Grand Central Station and Desertcreat are in the latter stages of construction.\nUlster University, Strule Shared Education Campus, Lisburn and Newry primary care centres and the Belfast Critical Care Unit make up the 11 major projects.\n'Not achieving value for money'\nMs Carville said: \"Even among the flagship projects, identified as the Northern Ireland Executive's highest priority, progress has been very limited.\n\"It is clear that departments are not achieving value for money in the delivery of these major capital projects.\"\nSpeaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster on Tuesday, Ms Carville said the system remained in need of reform despite a number of previous reports recommending change.\n\"There have been many reviews in this area in the past and many recommendations but they are not being addressed quickly enough to see major improvement in this area.\n\"When you look at the level of cost overruns and think how that money could be spent elsewhere in our system it's really imperative that we now take fundamental and immediate action to address these points\".\nMs Carville said the required reform must be driven by the Stormont Executive and, if adequately addressed, \"we would be able to save money rather than incur cost overruns\".\nThe \u00c2\u00a32.5bn overrun, she added, is \"money that could be spent elsewhere in the public sector on improving public services\".\n'Inefficient governance and delivery structures'\nThe NIAO last examined major infrastructure projects in 2019 with that work informing a report by Stormont's Public Accounts Committee (PAC).\nSome recommendations made by the PAC have been acted on, such as more regular scrutiny from the Northern Ireland Civil Service board.\nHowever, the NIAO said \"inefficient governance and delivery structures remain in place\".\nIt added that there are still concerns that the civil service lacks the skills and experience at the early stage of major projects when specifications, costings and timetables are being set.\nSpeaking on Good Morning Ulster on Tuesday, Mark Spence, chief executive of The Construction Employers Federation (CEF), said they were \"not surprised\" by the report's findings.\nPointing to a \"resource issue\", he said a lot of the most experienced people were lost through a large voluntary exit scheme in the public sector in recent years.\n\"Sometime projects have gone to the market with not robust enough specification of a project, which leads to vagueness and those things can lead to problems much later in the process,\" Mr Spence said.\nThe NIAO report highlights the Southern Regional College campus in Armagh as an example of best practice for infrastructure delivery.\nThat project, which involved building a new college, came in on time and slightly under budget.\nSome of the good practice highlighted included early engagement with the Strategic Investment Board, strong project governance and the effective use of collaborative digital tools.",
    "India has unveiled four Air Force pilots who have been shortlisted to travel on the country's maiden space flight scheduled for next year.\nThe Gaganyaan mission aims to send three astronauts to an orbit of 400km and bring them back after three days.\nIndia's space agency Isro has been carrying out a number of tests to prepare for the flight.\nIn October, a key test demonstrated that the crew could safely escape the rocket in case it malfunctioned.\nAfter its success, Isro said a test flight would take a robot into space in 2024, before astronauts are sent into space in 2025.\nAt a function at the Isro centre in the southern city of Thiruvananthapuram (formerly Trivandrum) on Tuesday, the four astronaut-designates were described as \"dreamers, adventurers and valiant men preparing to go into space\".\nThe officers, chosen from the Indian Air Force, were introduced as Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair, Group Captain Ajit Krishnan, Group Captain Angad Pratap and Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi and Isro chief S Somanath pinned badges with golden wings onto their shirts and Mr Modi described them as \"India's pride\".\n\"These are not just four names or four people. They are four powers who will carry the aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians to space. I congratulate and wish them all the best,\" he said.\nOfficials said the men were selected from a pool of Air Force pilots and had undergone extensive physical and psychological tests before being shortlisted.\nThey have undergone rigorous training for 13 months in Russia and are now carrying on with their gruelling schedule back home. A video screened at the event showed them working out in the gym, swimming and doing yoga.\nOn Tuesday, Isro also showed a glimpse of Vyommitra - Sanskrit word for \"space friend\" - the female humanoid that will be sent into space later this year.\nThe Gaganyaan Mission is India's first human space flight programme for which extensive preparations are underway at various Isro centres.\nNamed after the Sanskrit word for craft or vehicle to the sky, the Gaganyaan project has been developed at the cost of 90bn rupees ($1bn; \u00c2\u00a3897m).\nIf it succeeds, India will become only the fourth country to send a human into space after the Soviet Union, the US and China.\nGaganyaan has generated a lot of interest in India, although it's coming decades after Soviet Union and the US started making trips to the low Earth orbit. Both have been in space since 1961. China became the third country to reach space in October 2003 when a Chinese mission spent 21 hours and orbited Earth 14 times. And the US and China have fully operational space stations in low Earth orbit.\nAn Indian astronaut also went to space as early as in 1984 when Rakesh Sharma spent nearly eight days on a Russian spacecraft.\nLast year, India made major forays into space. The country made history by becoming the first to land near the Moon's south pole in August 2023.\nJust weeks later, scientists launched Aditya-L1, India's first observation mission to the Sun which is now in orbit, keeping an eye on our solar system's most important and volatile star.\nIndia has also announced ambitious new plans for space, saying it would aim to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.\nRead more India stories from the BBC:",

    "Alleged Red Army Faction (RAF) fugitive Daniela Klette has been arrested by German police after more than 30 years in hiding.\nThe 65-year-old was tracked down on Monday evening in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg.\nA second person, whose identity has not yet been confirmed, has also been arrested.\nMs Klette is renowned for allegedly being part of the far-left armed group which terrorised Germany for decades.\nShe is accused of attempted murder and a string of serious robberies.\nThe second person to be arrested, a man who appears to be in the same age range as Ms Klette's robbery accomplices, was carrying fake identification. Police have not yet determined his identity.\nMs Klette has been flown by helicopter to Bremen, in the region where she committed the alleged robberies, and is now in pre-trial detention in Verden.\nPolice confirmed her identity using fingerprints. She did not resist arrest. Police found her after a tip-off from the public in November 2023.\nOfficials say they do not yet know how she managed to stay underground for 30 years, whether she was in Germany and who helped her to remain undetected.\nThe apartment is now being searched. Police have found magazines and ammunition for a handgun in the apartment but have not found a weapon.\nOfficials describe this arrest as a milestone in the fight against \"terrorism\" and say that it shows that \"terrorists\" can never feel safe no matter how long ago their crimes.\n'Third generation'\nTabloid headlines about \"RAF Rentner\" or in English - the \"Red Army Faction pensioners\" - make the robberies between 1999 and 2016 sound like a TV sitcom about an elderly grandma on the run.\nBut the now-disbanded RAF - sometimes referred to as the Baader-Meinhof Gang - was violent.\nThirty-four people were killed between 1971 and 1993. The group targeted political figures and business leaders and among its victims were an attorney general and a Deutsche Bank chairman.\nMore than 200 people were injured.\nOfficials allege Ms Klette was part of the RAF's so-called third generation, which was active in the 1980s and 1990s.\nIt allegedly killed the Deutsche Bank boss in a roadside bomb, and shot dead a centre-left politician, tasked with privatising business in former communist East Germany, in his home.\nIn 1991 the group launched a gun attack on the US embassy in the western city of Bonn. No-one was injured, but traces of Ms Klette's DNA were later found at the site.\nTwo years later, the group bombed and partly destroyed a new prison which had just been built.\nHiding in the shadows\nThe Red Army Faction grew out of the 1960s radical student movement. Its aim was to undermine West German capitalism, and the group had links to Middle Eastern guerrillas.\nStill today, the RAF is sometimes revered in certain radical-left wing circles. The gang's symbols occasionally crop up on clothing, regularly sparking anguished debates in Germany about whether left-wing extremism and violence is glamorised, rather than taken seriously.\nThe RAF officially disbanded in 1998 and some members, including Daniela Klette, went underground. Since then she and two other former RAF members allegedly survived financially by carrying out armed robberies of supermarkets and cash transporters. It is thought they raked in millions of euros in total.\nPolice wanted posters, saying \"these people could be your neighbours\", show grainy 1980s photos of the trio as shaggy-haired students.\nMore recent police photos of Ms Klette's two accomplices show grey-haired middle-aged men. But she appears to have avoided being spotted or photographed and police photos simply show a reconstructed image of what she might look like aged 65.\nOn 14 February, a state prosecutor called for information from the public on national TV during a true-crime documentary series, and hundreds of people called in with possible leads.\nSomehow Daniela Klette managed to stay in the shadows and undetected for half her life as the search for her went nowhere for decades.\nUntil now.",
    "At least a dozen Indians have been duped by agents into fighting for Russian forces in the country's war with Ukraine with reports saying one of them was killed in a missile strike.\nHemal Ashwinbhai from Gujarat state died in a missile attack last week, The Hindu newspaper reported over the weekend.\nHemal's father had told the BBC on 23 February that he spoke to his son three days ago. He said that he was posted 20-22km (12-13 miles) inside Ukraine's border and called him every few days when he got access to the mobile network.\nThe distraught families of the remaining men have now appealed to the federal government to get them back home.\nThe duped men, aged between 22 and 31 and hired as \"helpers in the military establishment in Russia,\" were allegedly sent to the battlefield under the pretext of \"training,\" according to their families.\nIndian sources in Russia suggest dozens of Indians have joined the Russian army. However, a Russian defence ministry source informed The Hindu that the actual number recruited in the past year is approximately 100. The BBC has reached out to the Russian Embassy in Delhi, but there has been no response yet.\nIndia's foreign ministry has acknowledged \"that some Indian nationals have enlisted for support roles with the Russian army\".\n\"Each and every such case brought to the attention of the Indian Embassy in Moscow has been strongly taken up with the Russian authorities and those brought to the attention of the ministry have been taken up with the Russian Embassy in New Delhi. Several Indians have already been discharged as a result,\" the ministry said in a statement.\nThe ministry also urged \"all Indian nationals to exercise due caution and stay away from this conflict\".\nVideos of some of the men, explaining how they were tricked by agents and sent to the battlefield have shocked their families, all of whom are poor - their parents and siblings are either tuk-tuk drivers, tea sellers or handcart sellers.\nVictims and families allege agents demanded 300,000 rupees ($3,619; \u00c2\u00a32,857), promising a Russian passport after a few months of army service. Agents reportedly recruit people from India, UAE, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, with fees reaching up to 1.2m rupees.\nThe BBC spoke to some of their relatives, who say the men were lured by the promise of higher salaries and didn't know what they were getting into. The identities of the men still in Russia are not being revealed to protect them.\n\"My 28-year-old son worked in a packaging company in Dubai. He, along with three friends, saw an agent's video offering jobs in Russia with a promised salary of 90,000 to 100,000 rupees, compared to their current earnings of 35,000 to 40,000 rupees. They paid the agent 300,000 rupees through loans. Please help bring my son back,\" his father, who sells tea and eggs on a handcart in the state of Karnataka told BBC Hindi, breaking down on the phone.\nHis story mirrors those of others from the states of Telangana, Gujarat, Kashmir, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, all allegedly deceived. Only one person has successfully escaped Moscow and returned home.\nOne man from Uttar Pradesh speaking from a safe location in Moscow in a video shot in end-January said that they were \"were brought here by BabaVlog [a YouTube channel run by an Indian], and promised a salary of 150,000 rupees [a month]. We were not told that we are being drafted in an army.\" The BBC reached out to the channel but didn't receive a response.\nThose allegedly deceived lack war combat experience with one man from Uttar Pradesh, dressed in army fatigues, stating in a video message that he was recruited through a social media platform.\n\"In Moscow, we signed a contract in Russian and unwittingly became soldiers sent to fight in the war. We've been deceived,\" says the man, claiming that he and two other Indians have suffered combat injuries, gesturing with his seemingly injured right hand.\n\"Please get us out of this place. Otherwise, they will send us to the front. There is artillery [fire] and drones falling all over. We have zero experience in fighting a war. The agents have put us in this fix,\" he adds.\nSpeaking over the phone from the Russia-Ukraine border, a man from Kashmir reported being stranded in Mariupol in Ukraine with an Indian companion and nine people from Nepal and Cuba. He said he had injured his foot during training.\n\"My commander kept saying that use your right hand to shoot, use your left hand to shoot, shoot above, shoot down,\" he recalled.\n\"I had never touched a gun. It was extremely cold, and with the gun in my left hand, I ended up shooting my foot.\"\nThe brother of one of the men said he didn't know whether the Indians were \"in the Wagner private army or the Russian army. They're some 40km [24 miles] from the Ukraine border. They've been promised Russian citizenship in three months\".\nOnly Shaikh Mohammed Tahir from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, managed to avoid training or deployment in the war zone. \"I worked in a car battery workshop here",
    "The family of a pregnant Liverpool mum who died during labour at a Spanish hospital say they are still waiting for answers two-and-a-half years later.\nKelsey Brown, 34, was in \"horrendous pain\" and bleeding for more than five hours before she became unresponsive, an inquest heard.\nAn investigation is now underway into what happened at Ceram hospital in Marbella.\nMiss Brown's family said they were \"hopeful\" of some answers.\nGerard Majella Courthouse in Liverpool heard a delivery of blood did not arrive until minutes before Miss Brown died, on 20 July, 2021 - more than five and a half hours after she began bleeding.\nMiss Brown's mum, Maria Brown, told the BBC her daughter was a \"loving mum\" to her surviving child, aged five at the time of her death.\nAndre Rebello, senior coroner for Liverpool and Wirral, said his ability to investigate the circumstances of her death was limited because crucial medical documents had not been provided by the authorities in Spain.\nThe court heard hairdresser Miss Brown, who moved to Spain with her partner in December 2019, had been expecting her second child and all her antenatal appointments had been normal.\nShe went into labour on 20 July, and was admitted to Ceram hospital.\n'Horrendous pain'\nThe court heard that shortly after her arrival at the hospital, a scan revealed that her baby had died.\nMr Rebello said: \"Kelsey was advised she could not have a caesarean and she could not have an epidural, and would have to give birth naturally.\"\nAt about 13:30 CEST (11:30 GMT) Miss Brown began losing blood, and medical staff arranged to deliver her baby using forceps.\nMr Rebello said Miss Brown's partner and sister were also in attendance at the hospital, and described her as in \"horrendous pain\" and \"bleeding profusely\".\nThe baby, named Tom, was delivered at 16:30, and it became clear his cord had been wrapped around his torso and arm preventing him from feeding.\nThe inquest heard Miss Brown was still bleeding but the hospital had no supplies of blood on-site. A consignment arrived at 18:45, but Miss Brown was declared dead by a doctor at 19:15.\nMr Rebello said a post-mortem examination had taken place in Spain, but the results were \"withheld\".\nThe court heard Miss Brown's body had been repatriated and a further post-mortem was carried out in Liverpool, but that medical notes about the care received at Ceram hospital were unavailable and the medical cause of death could not be ascertained without that \"context\".\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office had advised there could be lengthy delays before the Spanish authorities provided the results of an investigation.\n'Loving mum'\nMr Rebello said he could only reach an open conclusion due to the lack of evidence.\nHe told Mr and Mrs Brown: \"Hopefully the Spanish authorities will make efforts to bring justice to what occurred, they will be looking to see if there were opportunities to do something meaningful for a different outcome.\"\nMrs Brown replied: \"Hopefully they will give us some answers.\"\nSpeaking outside the courthouse, Mrs Brown told the BBC: \"Kelsey was a loving mum, she has left her five-year-old son behind.

Even when I felt that I [was] at risk, I [was] still going out to look after my patients.\"\nDr Uke, a rheumatology consultant at Birmingham City Hospital, said working on the wards at the time was a \"very very scary\" experience and she saw people dying before she contracted the virus herself.\nAdmitted to a critical care unit, she was placed on a ventilator and put into an induced coma to help her recover.\nWhen she woke, 16 days after the twins had been born, she struggled to believe they were hers.\nDespite weighing just 27oz and 30oz at birth, she said her twins were now doing \"amazingly well\" and would be starting school in September.\nIn an interview with BBC Radio WM, Dr Uke also paid tribute to ITV's new pandemic drama Breathtaking, based on the memoir by palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke.\nShe said the show resonated with her own experience of working in as a doctor during the pandemic.\n\"It confirmed what I know because I experienced the Covid pandemic from both sides of the ward.

It is really breath-taking and overwhelming when you think about it.\"\nShe told the BBC she hoped it would bring more scrutiny to how the pandemic was handled and what NHS staff were \"put through\" during the pandemic.\nReflecting on her experience during the pandemic, Dr Uke said: \"It was an experience we never envisaged, because we were not prepared for it.\n\"If it happens again in the future, we will be able to deal with it better. That means we need to have a clear post-mortem to see what has happened, what went wrong, and making sure it doesn't happen again.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "A Canadian man who killed four members of a Muslim family was sentenced to life in prison as a judge ruled that his actions amounted to \"white nationalist\" terrorism.\nNathaniel Veltman, 22, was given five life sentences - four for murder and one for attempted murder.\nVeltman was found guilty by a jury in November.\nHe ran down the family with his truck in 2021 while they were walking in London, Ontario.\nSalman Afzaal, 46, and his wife Madiha Salman, 44, were killed by Veltman when he struck them with his truck. Their daughter Yumna Afzaal, 15, and Mr Afzaal's 74-year-old mother, Talat Afzaal, also died in the attack. The couple's nine-year-old son was seriously injured.\nAccording to evidence introduced at trial, Veltman targeted the family randomly after spotting the two women in the family wearing traditional Pakistani dress.\nSuperior Court Justice Renee Pomerance said that Veltman \"was seeking a place in the spotlight\" when he attacked the family.\n\"It is my hope, the sense of fear and intimidation won't be a lasting message of these actions,\" she said during his sentencing on Thursday, according to the London Free Press newspaper.\nThe judge noted that Veltman picked out \"innocent victims he had never met\", and after the crimes he confessed to police and flashed the OK symbol - an everyday gesture that white supremacists have attempted to co-opt.\n\"He wanted to commit a crime against all Muslims by threatening their safety and security,\" she said.\nVeltman will not be eligible for parole for 25 years.\nThe case was the first time a Canadian jury heard legal arguments about white supremacist terrorism.\nDuring an earlier sentencing hearing in January, an unprecedented number of victim impact statements - nearly 70 - were given in court.\nMany remarks underscored the irreparable harm experienced by the relatives and friends of the Afzaals - especially the family's orphaned son.\n\"All innocence was robbed from him that day,\" said Sayeda Sidra Jamal, a relative of Madiha Salman.\nMs Jamal told the hearing about the fear that the attack spread among the Muslim community in London.\n\"Will someone else target us? Dehumanize us? Hurt us? Kill us?\" she said.\nA statement written by the son was also read out during the January hearing.\nThe boy said that he was \"very sad at the fact I can't talk to my family anymore and make new memories with them\".\n\"I will have to get the metal plate in my leg removed which will be painful and I will have to learn how to walk again,\" he wrote.\nHe ended his statement with a message \"to all the young kids\".\n\"You may think that your siblings are really annoying, and to be honest I thought the same about Yumnah, but when they leave you would love to fight with them one last time,\" he wrote.\nThe Afzaal family moved to Canada from Islamabad in 2007. Their murder raised concerns in the wider Muslim community in London and Canada in the aftermath of the attack.\nIn a January statement, Veltman spoke of his \"deep regret\" over the murders.\n\"Over the course of days, months and years following June 6... I've seen the extent of pain and suffering that my actions did cause,\" he said.\nSpeaking to reporters outside the court on Thursday, Veltman's lawyer Christopher Hicks said he had expected the judge's ruling on terrorism, and left open the possibility of appeal against the verdict.\nTaking the stand in his own defence during the trial, Veltman said he was scarred by a strict Christian upbringing and struggled with obsessive compulsive disorder.\nHe also said that he was left detached from reality after taking magic mushrooms in the days before running the family down.\nHowever, Judge Pomerance rejected those arguments during Thursday's sentencing, saying they did not explain his actions. She said that Veltman \"drew his rage from internet sources\".\nEvidence introduced at trial showed that Veltman spent a month before the killings working on a document calling for violence, and was influenced by mass murders in New Zealand and Norway.\n\"The tentacles of hate can reach a broad audience when they are only a click away,\" the judge said.",

Haryana and Uttar Pradesh states, which are ruled by the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have deployed a large number of police and paramilitary troops to stop the farmers from reaching Delhi.\nActivists say farmers are a major voting bloc in India and the government does not want a protest spectacle - with farmers on tractors and other vehicles - on Delhi roads, especially with general elections due in the next few months.\nIn 2020, the farmers had started a similar protest and hunkered down at Delhi's borders for months and the government does not want a repeat of that.\nWhile the government has held several rounds of talks with the unions to quell the protests, no consensus has been reached yet. On Wednesday, a 22-year-old protester died during a reported standoff with Haryana police.

It can be passed onto babies during labour.\n'Should be offered to everyone'\nNatalie Lockyer's daughter Quinn died aged 10 weeks after developing GBS at five weeks old.\nMs Lockyer, 32, from near Haverhill, Suffolk, said Quinn's birth was \"perfect\" and she had no issues during labour.\nHowever, five weeks later she developed \"huffy\" breathing and in the days following was diagnosed with GBS after deteriorating in hospital.\nShe was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where Ms Lockyer said medics from around the world expressed their shock that GBS screening was not routine procedure in the UK, as it was in other countries.\n\"If they do it, why don't we? It's so simple,\" she said.\nShe said: \"We'll never know where she got it from because she developed it later. It probably was from me during labour.\n\"This should not be something charities and mums who have lost or got babies in really difficult circumstances because of the disease, have to push for, it should be something the NHS offers to everyone,\" Ms Lockyer added.\n'Albie could have been saved'\nRob Salmon and Becca Murcott's son Albie was born on Boxing Day 2023 and had Group B Strep Meningitis, which has caused a brain injury.\nHe became ill at home and was admitted to hospital where his condition stabilised.\nHis parents, from Cockfield, Suffolk, said they had never heard of the condition prior to their son's diagnosis.\nMs Murcott said: \"Potentially he'll be severely disabled through his brain injury, but there's also a chance he could still pass away, especially if he got an infection.\"\n\"If I'd been tested before giving birth to him, I would have been given antibiotics and he would have been fine,\" she said.\nMr Salmon said: \"We could have been tested and prepared for it and Albie could have been saved from it.\"\nMs Murcott said testing should be carried out in labour or shortly before.\n'Postcode lottery'\nOliver Plumb, from the charity Group B Strep Support, said it was a \"small number of babies\" exposed to the bacteria that developed a serious and potentially fatal infection.\nHe said around 800 babies a year developed the infection - which is about two babies a day - and about one a week will die, while another a week will be left with a lifelong disability.\n\"It's a heart-breaking start to life for families and that often the first they hear of Group B Strep is when their baby is sick or in intensive care\".\nThe charity has called for GBS to be a notifiable disease to make it a legal responsibility for infections to be reported. It added that current figures could be \"missing around one fifth of the infections\".\nThere was a \"postcode lottery\" in terms of how many families will hear about GBS, he said. The charity also backed calls for screening.\n\"In the UK we don't sadly have a routine testing programme, that's at odds with much of the rest of the high-income world. \"\nA DHSC spokesperson said a public consultation on the notifiable diseases list was carried out last year.\n\"DHSC and UKHSA are considering the responses and confirmation of any changes will be published in due course,\" they said.\nSeveral reasons for not recommending routine screening have been given by the committee, including that results can change in the last few weeks of labour, and that GBS does not cause infection in every baby.\nThe decision is due to be reviewed following an ongoing screening trial .\nHowever, the charities Group B Strep Support, Bliss, The UK Sepsis Trust, Meningitis Research Foundation, Meningitis Now and The Lullaby Trust have written to the DHSC to ask for the infection to be added to the government list.\nAny occurrence of a listed disease must be reported to allow outbreaks and spread to be monitored.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A Conservative MP is trying to overturn a government-backed plan to make abducting cats a criminal offence in England and Northern Ireland.\nSir Christopher Chope has proposed changes to the Pet Abduction Bill initially restricting it to dogs.\nHe says it should only cover cats when another new law requiring them to be microchipped has come into effect.\nHis amendments would be unlikely to pass a vote because the government is supporting the legislation.\nBut they will need time to be debated in the House of Commons, which could make it harder for an offence relating to either animal to be passed into law before the general election.\nCurrently, pets are considered in law to be property and stealing a pet is covered by the 1968 Theft Act . The law is similar in Scotland.\nThe Pet Abduction Bill would make stealing cats and dogs a specific criminal offence in England and Northern Ireland, with anyone convicted facing a fine or a maximum of five years in prison.\nSir Christopher said he did not believe cats should be included in the legislation until after regulations requiring them to be microchipped have come into force in England in June.\nA microchip is a tiny electronic device with a unique number, linked to their owner's details, which is implanted under an animal's skin.\nIt has been compulsory to microchip dogs in England, Scotland and Wales since 2016. It is also a condition of holding a dog licence in Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK where dog owners must still register their pets for an annual fee.\nThere is no requirement for cats to be microchipped in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales.\n'Callous crime'\nSir Christopher said he wanted to further incentivise microchipping by linking it to the ability to pursue somebody under the new offence and said another clause in the bill could allow it to be extended to cats at a later date.\n\"Cats could be included at the stage that we know that the microchipping is working,\" he told the BBC.\nHe said there was a difference in nature between cats and dogs and he believed his proposals better reflected the original recommendations of a body set up to explore the idea of a pet theft offence.\n\"The legislation came from a working party that was set up by the government during the period of lockdown and the conclusions of that working party were that the crime of pet abduction should be limited to dogs in the first instance.\"\nThe Pet Abduction Bill was introduced by Conservative MP Anna Firth as a Private Member's Bill after the government dropped similar measures last year.\nMrs Firth's bill widened the legislation to include cats after campaigning by cat charities.\nIt has the backing of the government and has been welcomed by a number of animal welfare groups. Environment Minister Rebecca Pow told the Commons in January that \"the unlawful taking of pets is a callous crime and it's right that perpetrators are brought to justice.\"\nShe said she hoped the legislation would make \"swift progress\".\nParliamentary procedure\nNow that amendments have been tabled, there must be a debate, which has been scheduled for 19 April.\nIf passed, it will then go to the House of Lords for consideration.\nSupporters of the bill had hoped that it would be able to go through the Commons, without amendments, as early as last week.\nSir Christopher does not believe his amendments will slow the Bill's progress.\nThe Christchurch MP has a track record of intervening in Private Members' Bills.\nIn 2018, he faced criticism for using a parliamentary procedure, under which any MP can stall a bill by shouting \"object\", to block a ban on \"upskirting\" - secretly taking a photo up a woman's skirt.\nIt was later brought in after the government adopted the measures. Sir Christopher said he supported the ban but had been objecting to parliamentary procedure .\nHe has also used the same mechanism to block other pieces of legislation including bills to offer protection orders for children at risk of female genital mutilation, to pardon the World War Two codebreaker Alan Turing and to ban wild animals in circuses.",

We will not tolerate antisemitism.\"\nThe father, who is also called Israel, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the family had considered leaving the UK and moving to Israel because of a rise in antisemitism since the Hamas attacks on 7 October.\nIsrael, who has asked the BBC not to use his last name for security reasons, said he and his family took precautions when in public.\n\"When we are walking in the city centre, when we take the kids on outings, we don't wear any Jewish outward sign, no pendants with a David star, I put hats over my kids' kippah, we're careful not to speak Hebrew,\" he said.\nHe had not previously hidden his faith, he said, adding: \"I would say I feel a bit unwelcome in places.\"\nHe said the family had sent the birth certificate in a hard-backed envelope. It was returned in a \"regular office brown envelope\" with the word Israel \"scribbled over in black pen\".\n\"My first thought was that it may have been damaged in transit but the Home Office envelope is in a good condition so we understand someone had done it deliberately,\" he said.\nHe said his wife had been very scared by the incident, particularly because \"someone has all our details and this is someone from a place that should be the most secure place.\"\nHe added that he trusted the Home Office to investigate and take action.\nThe CAA said the \"completely unacceptable\" incident had left the child's parents \"very concerned\".\nA spokesperson for the charity added: \"When sending off a passport application to the Home Office, the last thing one should ever expect is to have their child's birth certificate returned torn, with the parent's place of birth scribbled out, just because it is the Jewish state.\n\"We are assisting the parents, who are understandably very concerned about this incident.\"\nHome Secretary James Cleverly replied to the post on X (formerly Twitter), saying he had asked officials to \"investigate this urgently\" and to see that \"appropriate action is taken\".\nReports of antisemitic incidents in the UK reached a record high last year, according to figures from a Jewish security charity.\nThe Community Security Trust (CST) recorded 4,103 anti-Jewish hate incidents in 2023, up from 1,662 in 2022. Two thirds of incidents happened on or after the Hamas attacks on 7 October.\nThe latest figures from some of the UK's largest police forces also showed a significant rise in antisemitic offences in the month following the attacks.\nGreater Manchester Police recorded 74 such incidents compared with 15 during the same period the previous year, while the British Transport Police noted 87 offences - up from eight over the same period in 2022.\nThe Metropolitan Police separately recorded 218 antisemitic incidents between 1 and 18 October - up from 15 across the same period the previous year.\nSome forces, including the Met, also recorded a rise in Islamophobic offences.",
    "Health officials in Lincolnshire are warning that disruption to routine hospital services is \"inevitable\" as junior doctors go on strike.\nUnder contingency plans local NHS staff will be moved into different roles to cover striking junior doctors.\nThe industrial action is part of an ongoing dispute over pay.\nThe walkout started at 07:00 GMT on Saturday and will end at 23:59 on Wednesday 28 February.\nRebecca Neno from NHS Lincolnshire's Integrated Care Board said their priority was to protect urgent and emergency care services, so that people who needed treatment could be seen.\nHowever, she added that longer waits in emergency departments would be \"inevitable\".\nThe contingency plans would mean that some planned operations or outpatient appointments could be cancelled.\nThis is the 10th strike by junior doctors since March 2023.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA), which represents junior doctors, wants a 35% pay increase - a proposal rejected by ministers.\nThe government has previously said strikes must be called off before negotiations can resume.\nMs Neno said: \"I am not going to lie, it's a difficult period.  Whenever you take out a section of the workforce, things don't work out as well.\"\n\"Our focus is on keeping people safe and protecting our urgent care services.\"\n\"Consultants and senior nurses will work to cover roles, but absolutely there will be some operations cancelled.\"\nDuring the last period of industrial action in Lincolnshire, United Lincolnshire NHS Trust said 19 elective operations and 286 outpatient appointments were cancelled.\nWhy are the strikes happening?\nThe BMA wants a 35% pay uplift, to make up for what it says have been below-inflation rises since 2008.\nJunior doctors received a pay rise averaging nearly 9% this financial year - and during talks at the end of 2023, the option of an extra 3% on top of that was discussed.\nBut those talks ended in early December without a deal being reached.\nThe health secretary Victoria Atkins, who is the MP for Louth and Horncastle said: \"This action called by the BMA Junior Doctor Committee does not signal that they are ready to be reasonable.\n\"We urged them to put an offer to their members, but they refused.\n\"Five days of action will put enormous pressure on the NHS and is not in the spirit of constructive dialogue.\"\nNearly half of NHS doctors are junior doctors - a group that spans those just out of university through to some who have 10 years or more experience.\nThe BMA is balloting junior doctors on further industrial action beyond this strike.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram .

    "Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh has resigned along with his government, which runs parts of the occupied West Bank.\nMr Shtayyeh said new \"arrangements\" were needed to take account of the \"emerging reality in the Gaza Strip\".\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas accepted his decision, which could pave the way for a technocratic government.\nMr Abbas is under pressure from the US to reform the PA so it could govern Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war ends.\nLast week, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a vision for the territory that made no mention of any role for the PA.\nThe Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign in Gaza after Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel on 7 October and took 253 other people hostage.\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 29,782 people have been killed in the territory since then, including 90 in the past 24 hours.\nMr Shtayyeh, an economist who has been in office since 2019, announced his government's resignation at a cabinet meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday morning.\nHe explained that the decision \"comes in light of the political, security, and economic developments related to the aggression against Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, and the unprecedented escalation in the West Bank, including the city of Jerusalem\", according to the official Wafa news agency .\n\"I see that the next stage and its challenges require new governmental and political arrangements that take into account the emerging reality in the Gaza Strip, the national unity talks, and the urgent need for an inter-Palestinian consensus based on a national basis, broad participation, unity of ranks, and the extension of the Palestinian Authority's sovereignty over the entire land of Palestine,\" he added.\nMr Abbas asked Mr Shtayyeh and his cabinet to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed.\nHis preferred candidate for the premiership is believed to be Mohammed Mustafa, a US-educated economist and former senior World Bank official who is chairman of the Palestine Investment Fund.\nHe could be tasked with forming a new government of expert ministers not aligned to any factions, in the hope that Israel could be persuaded to let them govern Gaza after the war.\nThe PA, which was established in 1994 under the Oslo accords, has limited governance powers in parts of the occupied West Bank not under full Israeli control and is dominated by Mr Abbas's Fatah movement, Hamas's rival.\nIt lost control of Gaza in 2007, when Hamas ousted forces loyal to Mr Abbas a year after winning the last Palestinian elections, and is deeply unpopular among many Palestinians, both in the West Bank and Gaza.\nIn November, US President Joe Biden said Gaza and the West Bank \"should be reunited under a single governance structure, ultimately under a revitalised Palestinian Authority, as we all work toward a two-state solution\".\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said a reformed PA had to \"meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people and deliver for them\", including by combating corruption, engaging civil society and supporting media freedom.\nMr Netanyahu's plan for post-war Gaza, which he presented to ministers on Thursday, does not rule out a role for the PA. But it also does not specifically mention the body either.\nIt instead talks about handing responsibility for civilian management and public order to \"local elements with managerial experience\", who would \"not be identified with countries or entities that support terrorism and will not receive payment from them\". It also envisages a completely \"demilitarised\" Gaza, with Israel staying in charge of security for the foreseeable future.\nA spokesman for Mr Abbas said the plan was doomed to fail.",

    "Scientists have revealed a new, remarkably complete fossil - a 16ft (5m)-long aquatic reptile from the Triassic period.\nThe creature dates back 240 million years and has been dubbed a \"dragon\" because of its extremely long neck.\nIt is called Dinocephalosaurus orientalis, a species that was originally identified back in 2003.\nThis spectacular new fossil has allowed scientists to see the full anatomy of this bizarre prehistoric beast.\nDr Nick Fraser, from National Museums Scotland, who was part of the international team that studied the fossil, said this was the first time scientists had been able to see it in full. He described it as \"a very strange animal\".\n\"It had flipper-like limbs and its neck is longer than its body and tail combined,\" he said.\nThe researcher speculated that a \"long, bendy and flexible neck\", with its 32 separate vertebrae, might have provided a hunting advantage - allowing Dinocephalosaurus orientalis to search for food in crevices under the water.\nThe fossil was discovered in ancient limestone deposits in southern China.\n\"This discovery just adds to the weirdness of the Triassic,\" Dr Fraser told BBC News. \"And every time we look in these deposits, we find something new.\"\nThe paper describing a set of new fossils of the animal is published in the journal Earth and Environmental Science: Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.",
    "The UN's top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), is hearing the final arguments in a case challenging Israel's 56-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.\nThe question at the heart of this week's hearings is: What are the legal consequences of Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories?\nIt may not have the drama of recent World Court cases, but leading international lawyer Philippe Sands told the BBC: \"In terms of the legal outcomes, and solution that must ultimately be found, this is as significant as it gets.\"\nThis case was initiated by a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution in December 2022, before the 7 October attacks by Hamas last year, and Israel's military response in the Gaza Strip.\nWhat arguments have been heard?\nOn the opening day of hearings last week, Riad al-Maliki, the Palestinian Authority (PA)'s foreign minister, accused Israel of \"colonialism and apartheid\" and of violating the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.\nHe illustrated his presentation using a series of maps appearing to show the dramatic erosion of Palestinian territory.\nThe final picture was shown of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the UNGA last September, holding up a map that he called the \"new\" Middle East in which all traces of Palestinian territory had been removed.\n\"There is no Palestine at all on this map, only Israel, comprised of all the land from Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea,\" Mr al-Maliki told the hearing.\n\"This shows you what the prolonged, continuous Israeli occupation of Palestine is intended to accomplish - the complete disappearance of Palestine and the destruction of the Palestinian people.\"\nInternational lawyer Paul S Reichler told the ICJ that permanent occupation is a legal oxymoron. An occupation which continues indefinitely becomes an annexation, he said.\nPhilippe Sands, who was among the PA's legal team, told the judges: \"The right of self-determination... requires that UN member states bring Israel's occupation to an immediate end.\n\"No aid, no assistance, no complicity, no contribution to forcible actions, no money, no arms, no trade. No nothing.\"\nMany countries used their 30-minute presentations to argue that the Palestinian people's right to self-determination was being violated by Israel's occupation.\nIsrael declined to take part in the hearings, instead submitting a written statement arguing the proceedings were \"harmful\" to ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict, because the questions posed by the UN were prejudicial.\nHowever, Israel's closest allies did participate.\nThe United States told the ICJ that an order of withdrawal without security assurances would be detrimental to peace negotiations. It asked the judges to ensure any advisory opinion would serve to reinforce rather than destabilise the prospect of a two-state solution.\nThe UK went further than any other country, in asking the panel of 15 international judges not to issue an advisory opinion at all, because Israel had not consented to the process.\nThis may in part be linked to another case at the ICJ brought by Mauritius against the UK with regards to the Chagos Islands, in which the UK made the same argument, and lost.\nA number of countries referred to the Hamas attacks in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken to Gaza as hostages as evidence of Israel's need for security. By extension they argued that any withdrawal of Israeli forces must be accompanied by security assurances.\nWhy do these proceedings matter?\nIf the ICJ issues a non-legally binding advisory opinion, it then goes to the UN General Assembly, which adopts a resolution. That would be significant and could constitute a catalyst for negotiations and set the legal parameters for a future negotiated settlement.\nIf the court's opinion is that Israel's occupation is illegal, it will tell all UN bodies and nations they must do nothing to support or contribute to the current situation.\nSuch a ruling could potentially have far-reaching trade implications, but of greatest significance would be the consequences for the legitimacy of Israel's position. Countries like the US may find it increasingly difficult to continue to support Israel.\nThe current case brought by the UNGA represents the first time since the 1940s that the UN's highest judicial body has had a chance to address the totality of these issues.\nOver the past few weeks, some of the ICJ presentations have gone viral on TikTok, reflecting how legal arguments which can often feel remote and disconnected are resonating with audiences in this case, well beyond the ICJ's Great Hall of Justice.\nMeanwhile, Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of committing acts amounting to \"collective punishment\" by ignoring a separate ICJ order to enable aid delivery to Gaza, and thus exposing the 2.3 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza to the prospect of starvation.\nOn Monday, Israeli officials confirmed that a response had been delivered to the ICJ regard",

    "Millions of supermarket chickens show skin burns from living in their own waste, a BBC investigation has found.\n\"Hock burn\" is caused by ammonia from excrement. A sign of poorer welfare on farms, it can be seen on a third of birds in some supermarkets, data shows.\nThe BBC asked the 10 biggest UK chains about its presence on their shelves. Co-op and Aldi reported the highest rates but five refused to release data.\nThe British Retail Consortium said the issue was taken \"very seriously\".\nHock burn is often associated with a high-stocking density of birds and is a result of prolonged contact to moist, dirty litter. It shows up on packaged and prepared meat as brown ulcers on the back of the leg.\nChicken with hock burn markings is still safe to eat. But the amount of hock burn within a poultry flock is an industry-accepted indicator of wider welfare standards on farms.\nRed Tractor, the UK's biggest farm and food assurance scheme, sets a target rate for hock burn of no more than 15% of a flock.\nA spokesperson for Co-op said that \"every effort\" was made to minimise the occurrence of hock burn, also known as hock marking.\nAn Aldi spokesperson added it that it worked closely with suppliers to \"ensure continuous improvement in our food\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 products\".\nKate Parkes, poultry specialist at the RSPCA, told the BBC that hock burn was \"a concerning health issue and, sadly, too common in many intensive farm settings\".\nShe added that the risk of hock burn \"is significantly higher when birds are poorly managed, genetically selected to grow very fast or reared in overcrowded conditions\".\nWhile Lidl was one of the stores that did not provide data to the BBC, it has been the focus of store spot checks by one animal welfare campaign group, Open Cages.\nIt asked volunteers to check more than 500 whole chickens on shelves at 22 Lidl stores in nine UK towns and cities between September and November last year.\nIncluding any sign of hock burn ulcers at all, it says their shoppers found 74% of the chickens they checked had the condition.\nConnor Jackson, co-founder of the campaign group, said hock burn was \"one symptom of a much larger problem\".\nHe added that many retailers \"source chickens raised in heavily-crowded sheds, bred for extremely rapid growth, and this is routinely causing chickens immense suffering\".\nLidl is now being urged to sign up to the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC), a set of RSPCA-backed higher welfare standards for the industry.\nHealth 'closely monitored'\nA spokesperson for Lidl said the total number of chicken products that Open Cages said it had checked in its survey was a tiny percentage of the fresh chicken it sold in that period.\nHe added: \"The figures provided by Open Cages strongly conflict with our own data, which is lower than industry figures publicly available.\"\nThe company declined to share its actual hock burn figures but said it had plans in place to publish a full and detailed animal welfare report soon.\n\"We take animal welfare extremely seriously, and the health of animals in our supply chain is closely monitored, with regular independent audits carried out to ensure that expected standards are being met,\" he said.\nThe British Poultry Council, which represents suppliers, processors and farmers, added that \"drawing comparison between formal inspection and rigorous procedure versus a shop-shelf experiment has potential to mislead and misinform\".\nIt added that where hock-marking does occur \"it is used as an indicator to identify areas for improvement because ours is an industry that operates to science-based standards, prioritises investment in research and development, and keeps pace with innovation\".\nThe BBC requested animal welfare data from 10 leading UK food sellers: Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi, Co-op, Lidl, Waitrose, Iceland and Ocado.\nFive of the companies - Asda, Morrisons, Lidl, Iceland and Ocado - failed to provide specific figures.\nOf the remaining five, Co-op, which is supplied with an estimated 30 million chickens a year, recorded hock burn in 36.7% of its poultry.\nA spokesperson for the company said: \"We work with our supplier to make every effort to minimise the occurrence of hock markings.\"\nShe added that the company had this month moved to using lower stocking density birds \"which will have a significant positive impact on the reduction of hock markings, amongst other welfare benefits\".\nAldi's most recent annual figures revealed it had found hock burn in 33.5% of its chickens.\nAn Aldi spokesperson said it recorded and published welfare data to \"ensure transparency\".\n\"We take animal welfare extremely seriously and work closely with our suppliers to ensure continuous improvement in our food and non-food products.\"\n'Significant step' taken\nCompany animal welfare reports reveal Tesco recorded a 26.3% rate in its chickens in 2022/23.

    "A police force has apologised to a 16-year-old girl and her family after an officer used \"inappropriate\" language during her arrest.\nA video of the incident in Leeds in August 2023 went viral on social media.\nThe West Yorkshire force apologised after an Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation.\nAn IOPC spokesperson said it would be \"appropriate\" for the officer to undertake \"reflective practice\", but more serious punishment was not needed.\nThe girl was arrested in the early hours of Monday 7 August after making a \"potentially homophobic comment\" which an officer believed was directed towards her, the spokesperson added.\nShe did not face criminal charges.\n'Inappropriate'\nThe IOPC launched an investigation after a complaint was made against the force following the incident at a residential address.\nIt found the officers involved in the girl's arrest \"on the whole did attempt to de-escalate the situation and the level of force used appeared to have been appropriate in the circumstances\".\nBut a spokesperson said some of the language used by one of the officers towards the girl was \"inappropriate and was not conducive to de-escalating the situation.\"\nThey said the unnamed officer did not have a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct.\nInstead, the reflective practice, which would be undertaken with their supervisor, would allow them to \"reflect and learn from the incident to prevent any issues identified from re-occurring, as their actions fell short of the expectations of the public and the police service\".\nWest Yorkshire Police agreed with the IOPC's findings and had also written to the girl and her family \"to remedy any dissatisfaction\", the spokesperson said.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Two men who ran a trampoline park where 270 people were injured - including 11 breaking their backs - have been handed a community order and a fine.\nAn inquiry was launched after medics at the local A&E raised concerns over the number of people needing treatment after visiting Flip Out in Chester.\nMatthew Melling, of Manchester, and David Shuttleworth, of Stoke, were directors of the Chester franchise.\nThe pair, aged 34, admitted an offence under the Health and Safety Act.\nChester Crown Court heard how injuries were reported the day after the park opened on 10 December 2016 but there was no evidence to show the company did anything to reduce the risk of injury.\nAmong those injured were 120 people who suffered facial injuries with one woman suffering a severe tear that might require cosmetic surgery in the future.\nMelling and Shuttleworth were present during a number of the incidents involving the tower jump - 17ft 3ins  (5.3m) in height - between December 2016 and February 2017.\nInjuries were sustained when visitors, many of whom were children, jumped from three different levels into a foam pit below, the court heard.\nThe directors, who are now both earning about \u00c2\u00a380,000 each working as business consultants, had assumed the set-up from another Flip Out centre in Stoke could be applied to the jump in Chester.\nBut health and safety checks, including risk assessments and ensuring the safety of the foam landing, were not sufficient, the court heard.\nDuring the two months the jump was open, about 200,000 people visited the attraction on Chester Gates Business Park.\nSentencing the pair, Justice Leeming said \"lives had been ruined by what happened at Flip Out\".\nHe said the men had a \"cavalier approach to health and safety\" with some of the injured \"left with years of pain and suffering and genuine concerns about their futures\".\nHe told the court Melling and Shuttleworth had \"both expressed regret and remorse\" and were not on site every day so they were not \"aware of the steady stream of injuries\".\nBut he added: \"If you were old enough to run a business, you were old enough to take on health and safety responsibilities.\"\nShuttleworth was ordered to pay a fine of \u00c2\u00a36,500 and court costs of \u00c2\u00a350,000 while Melling was fined \u00c2\u00a36,300 and pay costs of \u00c2\u00a310,000 after both admitted being an employer or self-employed person who failed to discharge a general health and safety duty to a person other than an employee.\nThe pair were also handed a 12-month community order involving 250 hours of unpaid community service.\nJustice Leeming said he was passing sentence on the basis the two defendants were negligent rather than committing deliberate acts or cost cutting at the expense of safety.\nThe defendants' company, Shuttleworth and Melling Ltd, went into liquidation in 2021.

    "Deep divisions within the DUP have been laid bare again as MPs and peers passed a key motion in the party's deal to restore power sharing.\nThe humble address motion was proposed by the government to reassure unionists about Northern Ireland's place in the UK.\nThe humble address is a parliamentary procedure to send a message to the King.\nIt allows MPs and peers to vote on a motion without having to pass a bill.\nThe humble address was one of the government's commitments in the Safeguarding the Union deal agreed with the DUP.\nBut senior figures in the party who are opposed to the deal challenged the motion in both Houses of Parliament this week.\n'Anti-unionist'\nBefore the Safeguarding the Union deal was agreed, the DUP had been blocking Northern Ireland's devolved government for nearly two years in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\nFormer DUP Deputy leader Lord Dodds said there was nothing in the humble address \"which actually changes anything\" and he added the \"anti-unionist contents\" of the Protocol and Windsor Framework remained intact.\n\"This where the words collide with reality - where propaganda collides with the facts,\" he said.\nWaving sheets of paper, Lord Dodds said \"hundreds upon hundreds of EU laws\" still apply to Northern Ireland without the ability of voters to change them.\nFellow Peer Lord McCrea accused of the government of \"pulling the wool over the eyes of unionists\" with the Windsor Framework, adding that London only ever cared about getting the assembly \"up and running\".\n'Difficult decisions'\nBut his colleague Lord Hay defended the party leadership over how it negotiated the deal with the government.\nHe said the leadership had to grapple with \"difficult decisions\" while others can just complain from the sidelines.\nBaroness Hoey sought to amend the motion as she challenged what she called the government's \"rhetoric\" and claimed the protocol continued to \"over-ride and suspend\" parts of the Act of Union.\nBut on Monday in the House of Commons DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson attacked those who had criticised his deal with the government.\nHe accused them of not understanding the true implications of restoring the Act of Union which he said would turn the clock back to 1801 when some goods moving GB and Northern Ireland were subject to tariffs.",

    "Families bereaved by the Grenfell Tower fire have laid flowers at the building in Valencia that was destroyed in last week's fatal blaze.\nMeeting emergency responders, they said there were direct parallels between the 2017 disaster in London and the fire in Spain, in which 10 people died.\nConstruction pictures suggest the cladding used on the building may be of a type now banned in the UK.\nThe manufacturer Alucoil has been contacted for a response.\nThree people affected by the Grenfell fire travelled to Valencia to show solidarity to those who died, along with two people who were impacted by a fire at apartments in Milan in 2021.\nSawsan Choucair whose mother, sister, nieces and brother-in-law died in Grenfell said she was confronted by \"the same scene of destruction, the same image, even the same smell of burning plastic.\"\nShe said: \"My heart goes out to the families who lost loved ones. It is an unimaginable pain that we experienced, and it never goes away.\n\"For these Spanish families to experience it now is devastating.\"\n\"My greatest fear is who's next?\"\nImages of the construction of the building on Avenue del General Avil\u00c3\u00a9s, retrieved from Google Maps in 2008, suggest the cladding panels used were made by the Spanish multinational Alucoil.\nThe pictures show a protective covering marked \"Larson\".\nAlucoil has produced three types of cladding panel and the BBC has not been able to verify which ones have been used in the building. However, one of the cladding panels it produces, Larson PE, is known to be highly combustible.\nIt is no longer marketed by the company but, according to marketing materials, it was available as late as 2018, the year after the Grenfell Tower fire.\nLarson PE has a layer of polyethylene, a highly flammable plastic.\nThis product, along with another more fire-retardant version, Larson FR, would likely be banned for use on many buildings above 18m in the UK today, due to changes in the law following the Grenfell Tower fire, though the new rules are complex.\nExperts say a third version, Larson A2, with the highest performance in fire, would not have been on the market in 2008.\nIn a video of the early stages of the fire, seen by BBC News, the flames are spreading in a similar way to those in the Grenfell disaster. The fire is moving up and down the edges of the cladding panels.\nThe Larson PE product is similar to Reynobond PE, the cladding blamed for allowing the Grenfell fire to spread so quickly. Both have been given, in some tests, a European classification of E for reaction to fire.\nThe ratings go from A1, which is best, to F.\nProducts with an E rating make a \"high contribution to fire\" according to the European standard.\nThe BBC has contacted Alucoil for a response.",

    "US President Joe Biden says he hopes to have a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza by Monday.\nHis comments come amid reports of some progress in indirect negotiations involving Israeli and Hamas officials.\nIt would involve aid deliveries to Gaza and the release of more hostages taken during the 7 October Hamas attacks.\nIsrael has not commented and Hamas officials have indicated the two sides are not as close to a ceasefire deal as Mr Biden suggested.\nQatar, which has been mediating in the talks alongside Egypt, said there was no deal to announce yet.\nThe Qatari foreign ministry spokesman, Majed al-Ansari, said Doha was \"going to push for a pause before the beginning of Ramadan\" and felt \"hopeful, not necessarily optimistic\".\nIsrael launched a large-scale air and ground campaign in Gaza after Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel.\nThe attackers also took 253 people hostage, a number of whom have since been released.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip says at least 29,878 people have been killed in the territory since then - including 96 deaths in the past 24 hours - in addition to 70,215 who have been wounded.\nAccording to Reuters news agency, quoting an unnamed source close to the talks, Hamas is still studying a draft framework, drawn by France, which would include a 40-day pause in all military operations and the exchange of Palestinians held in Israeli jails for Israeli hostages, at a ratio of 10 to one.\n\"We're close,\" President Biden told reporters in New York on Monday. \"We're not done yet. My hope is by next Monday we'll have a ceasefire.\"\nOn NBC's \"Late Night With Seth Meyers\" which was broadcast later, the president said Israel would be willing to pause its assault during Ramadan if a deal was reached.\nThe Islamic holy month begins around 10 March.\n\"Ramadan's coming up and there has been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well, in order to give us time to get all the hostages out,\" Mr Biden said.\nOn Tuesday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that \"talks continue\" but that \"ultimately, some of this comes down to Hamas\" to agree.\n\"We'd certainly welcome one by this weekend...we are trying to push this deal over the finish line,\" Mr Miller added, although he declined to comment further on the negotiations or possible timing. \"We think it's possible.\"\nHowever, a Hamas official told the BBC earlier: \"The priority for us in Hamas is not the exchange of detainees, but the cessation of the war.\n\"It is not logical, after all this loss of life and property, to accept any offer that does not lead to a complete ceasefire, the return of the displaced, and the reconstruction of Gaza.\"\nLast week, the US - Israel's main ally - was widely criticised for vetoing a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Instead, it proposed its own resolution for a temporary ceasefire \"as soon as practicable\", which also warned Israel not to invade the southern Gazan city of Rafah \"under current circumstances\".\nIsrael has faced mounting international pressure not to launch an offensive in Rafah, where about 1.5m Palestinians are sheltering, most having fled fighting further north in the territory.\n\"There are too many innocent people that are being killed,\" Mr Biden said on Late Night With Seth Meyers. \"And Israel has slowed down the attacks in Rafah. They have to. And they've made a commitment to me they're going to see to it that there is ability to evacuate significant portions of Rafah before they go and take out the remainder of Hamas.\"\nOn Sunday, the Israeli prime minister's office said it had received plans from its military to evacuate civilians from areas including Rafah.\nMr Netanyahu said in an interview with CBS on Sunday that Israeli forces would eventually launch an invasion of Rafah regardless of any agreement for a temporary ceasefire, insisting: \"We can't leave the last Hamas stronghold without taking care of it.\"\n\"If we have a deal, it'll be delayed somewhat,\" he added. \"But it'll happen. If we don't have a deal, we'll do it anyway.\"\nIn a separate development on Monday, Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh resigned along with his government, which runs parts of the occupied West Bank.\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas accepted his decision, which could pave the way for a technocratic government.\nMr Abbas is under pressure from the US to reform the PA so it can govern Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war ends.\nLast week, Mr Netanyahu presented a vision for the territory that made no mention of any role for the PA.",

    "Customer service at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is at an all-time low as phone line waiting times continue to deteriorate, according to MPs.\nNearly two-thirds of taxpayers were forced to wait more than 10 minutes to speak to an adviser, a committee found.\nMPs launched another blistering attack on HMRC years after declaring its hold music was among the most streamed.\nHMRC said its digital services provided answers to millions of queries and was \"highly rated\".\nThe average wait for a call to HMRC to be answered was 16 minutes and 24 seconds in the year to April 2023, according to the report by the Public Accounts Committee. That compares with 12 minutes and 22 seconds the previous year.\nSome 63% of callers waited more than 10 minutes to speak to an adviser, up from 46% in 2021-22. The committee said this proportion had increased every year since 2018-19.\n\"Almost eight years have passed since our committee challenged HMRC over its telephone lines' holding message being one of the most streamed pieces of music in the country ,\" said Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee.\n\"Our latest report into its performance sadly illustrates a continued tale of decline in its services.\"\nOnline shift\nThe tax authority has long-documented difficulties in swiftly answering calls. It sparked controversy when it closed its main self-assessment helpline over the summer, and encouraged people to use a chatbot instead.\nIt has used an answer by text service and told MPs that it did not have the resources to meet rising demand. It said it received more than three million calls on resetting online passwords, getting tax codes, and checking National Insurance numbers, all of which could easily be done via digital channels instead.\nThe committee said that more people were being drawn into paying tax, known as fiscal drag , and their tax affairs were becoming more complicated. As a result HMRC's customer service was \"struggling to cope\" and taxpayers were left \"exasperated\" by the quality of support.\nAmong the other issues highlighted in the report, published on Wednesday, were:\nIn May, the BBC revealed how Cardiff flat owner Dylan Davies received 11,000 tax bills from HMRC over the course of six months, after Chinese companies fraudulently used his address to register for VAT.\nThe committee highlighted a case in which a taxpayer received more than 10,000 letters due to an agent registering companies for VAT at the taxpayer's address rather than a serviced office that shared the same postcode.\n\"These cases create particular distress for innocent citizens receiving these demands for payments, and an extraordinary amount of time and effort to resolve with HMRC,\" the committee said.\nThe MPs said that the distress caused to innocent people was not being taken seriously enough.\nA spokesman for HMRC said it was making strong progress on improving customer services, with a focus on digital services.\n\"Millions more people used our highly rated online services last year - saving them waiting on the phone and freeing up our advisers to deal with those people who need extra support,\" he said.\n\"People used our app and online services more than 200 million times last year with an 80% satisfaction rate, while three-quarters of all customer correspondence was answered in 15 working days - a significant improvement on the 45% in 2021-22.\"",
    "The Conservative Senedd leader has urged the first minister to launch an investigation into donations received by the economy minister as part of his Welsh Labour leadership campaign.\nIt emerged on Wednesday that Vaughan Gething had accepted \u00c2\u00a3200,000 from a company run by a man who has twice been convicted for environmental offences.\nAndrew RT Davies said it raised questions about Mr Gething's judgement.\nMr Gething has said the donations were \"checked and filed properly\".\nThey were also \"declared to the Senedd\", he said. The Welsh government has been asked to comment.\nIn the meantime, a former Welsh government minister told BBC Wales Mr Gething had been \"naive\" and had shown \"appalling judgement\".\nVaughan Gething, the Cardiff South and Penarth Senedd member (MS), is up against Education Minister Jeremy Miles in the race to succeed Mr Drakeford as leader of Welsh Labour and first minister of Wales.\nElectoral Commission documents show that he has received two separate donations of \u00c2\u00a3100,000 from Dauson Environmental Group, since Mr Drakeford announced his decision to stand down in December.\nThat company is run by David Neal, who was given a suspended prison sentence in 2013 for illegally dumping waste on a conservation site.\nFour years later he was given another suspended prison sentence for failing to remove the waste .\nFirms operated by Mr Neal previously donated \u00c2\u00a338,000 to Mr Gething, in 2018, at the time of the last Welsh Labour leadership race.\nIn a letter to the first minister on Thursday, Andrew RT Davies described the reports as \"concerning\".\n\"There is also the matter that Dauson Environmental Group operates in an area of business which is regulated by the Welsh government, so it is important that no perception of favourability can be allowed to develop.\n\"Can you confirm that you will be launching an investigation into the economy minister under the Ministerial Code in order to clarify this matter?\"\nThe Ministerial Code is a set of rules that government ministers are expected to follow.\nIt states that: \"Ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise.\"\n'This just stinks'\nRecords also show that firms operated by Mr Neal have received loans via the Development Bank of Wales, a Welsh government-owned body which provides financial support to Welsh businesses.\nAs economy minister, Vaughan Gething is responsible for overseeing the Development Bank of Wales.\nA former minister, who did not want to be named, told BBC Wales: \"This just stinks. The ministerial code makes it clear that ministers have to take personal responsibility on donations.\n\"Taking a donation from a recipient of Development Bank funds, when you are minister for the Development Bank, is naive and shows appalling judgement, to say the least.\"\nDr Elin Royles, from Aberystwyth University's Centre for Welsh Politics and Society, said the donations to Mr Gething's campaign \"raise questions about his attitude towards environmental issues\".\n\"And you can imagine how it stirs things up in relation to the agricultural protests at the moment,\" she told BBC Radio Cymru.\nSpeaking on the discussion programme Dros Ginio (English translation - Over Lunch), she said: \"Why put farmers in such a difficult position to act on the environment if you then are willing to take money from a company that obviously doesn't respect environmental regulations?\n\"It could be a problem for him in this leadership campaign but because of the timing with ballots it's probably going to have less of an impact than it would have a few weeks ago.\"\nWhat is Vaughan Gething saying?\nAs he took part in a BBC Wales hustings programme on Wednesday night, Mr Gething said the donations had all been \"checked and filed properly with the Electoral Commission\" and \"declared to the Senedd\".\nA spokesperson for Mr Gething's campaign said: \"Dauson Environmental Group Limited has donated to Vaughan Gething's leadership campaign.\n\"All donations are declared to both the Senedd and the Electoral Commission in line with the rules and Vaughan's commitment to transparency.\n\"It's a matter of public record that Welsh government ministers do not take decisions on individual investments or loans provided by the Development Bank of Wales.\n\"Vaughan Gething's leadership manifesto pledges to strengthen enforcement action to protect the environment and pledges stricter penalties for those who break environmental rules.\"",
    "The final words of a man who killed 11 people in a stabbing spree in Canada in 2022 have been revealed at a coroner's inquest into his in-custody death.\nMyles Sanderson told arresting officers \"You guys should have shot me, man\", using an expletive, later saying \"I'm ready to die now\", Canadian media reported.\nThe inquest heard that Sanderson had died from an acute cocaine overdose.\nHe was arrested in a high-speed chase after a massive manhunt.\nThe stabbings took place over Canada's Labour Day weekend on 4 September two years ago in the province of Saskatchewan.\nTen of the victims, including his brother Damien Sanderson, were from the James Smith Cree Nation, an indigenous community in the prairie province. One victim was from the nearby community of Weldon. Seventeen people were injured in the rampage.\nPolice caught Sanderson after a three-day search. He was stopped while driving a stolen truck at high speeds, rammed by police and forced into a ditch on the side of the motorway.\nThe coroner's inquest heard on Monday that police quickly realised that Sanderson needed medical attention during his arrest. A paramedic was on the scene within minutes and Sanderson was in hospital within an hour. He was declared dead shortly after.\nInquest witness Det Sgt Ken Kane said there was no evidence that police action had \"caused or contributed to the death of Myles Sanderson\", the Saskatoon StarPhoenix reported.\nIt is not clear what prompted the mass killings, which encompassed multiple crime scenes. Myles and Damien spent days drinking, dealing drugs and stealing cars before the spree began, police have said. Damien was the first victim.\nMyles then went to another home, where he killed Robert Sanderson, his second victim.\nOver the next few hours, Myles Sanderson travelled both by foot and stolen vehicles around the community, breaking into a series of homes.\nIn one, he killed Gregory Burns and attacked his mother Bonnie Burns. He later returned to that residence and killed Bonnie Burns, along with Gloria Burns, a former first responder who had arrived on the scene to help.\nHis other victims in James Smith Cree Nation were Thomas Burns, Carol Burns, Earl Burns, Lana Head, and Christian Head. In Weldon, he killed his last victim, Wesley Petterson, 78.\nParole documents show Sanderson has 59 prior convictions and was released in February 2022 while serving a four-year sentence.\nA public inquiry earlier this year heard that Sanderson had targeted some of his victims over a personal grievance and that others had simply got in the way.",

    "Azad, Donya and Bahareh don't know each other.\nBut the three women - whose names we've changed for their own safety - share a fierce determination to resist Iran's theocratic government, and the dress codes it has imposed on women and girls for 45 years.\nSo, every day, they head out of their homes in the capital Tehran - without covering their hair - despite the potential risks.\n\"It's very scary,\" 20-year-old music student Donya tells me over an encrypted app. \"Because they can arrest you any minute and fine you. Or torture you with lashes. The usual penalty if you're arrested is 74 lashes.\"\nLast month, a 33-year old Kurdish-Iranian activist, Roya Heshmati, made public that she'd been given 74 lashes after posting a photograph of herself unveiled.\nBut Donya, Azad and Bahareh say there is, for them, no going back.\n\"It is symbolic,\" says Donya. \"Because it is the regime's key to suppressing women in Iran. If this is the only way I can protest and take a step for my freedom, I'll do it.\"\nThe three women will also protest later this week by not turning out to vote in the country's first parliamentary elections since authorities brutally repressed the women-led uprising that followed the death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022.\nShe had been detained by the morality police for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly. Refusing to wear the hijab in public can lead to imprisonment and torture - yet many women do it anyway.\n\"It's true that there's no longer a strong presence of people on the streets,\" 34-year-old HR manager Azad tells me.\n\"But in our hearts, the regime has been completely destroyed, and people don't accept anything it does. So their way of showing their disapproval will be not to vote.\"\n'Solitary confinement was the worst you can imagine'\nAzad was arrested in October 2022 and imprisoned for a month.\nShe was re-arrested in July last year, for social media posts criticising the government, and spent 120 days in jail - 21 of them in solitary confinement.\n\"Solitary confinement was the worst place you can imagine,\" she says. \"The cell door was locked all the time. The cell was 1m (3.3ft) by 1.5m (4.9ft). There was no outside light, but artificial lights were on day and night. We were blindfolded when we went to the toilet.\"\nAzad was so disturbed by the ordeal that she hit her head against the cell wall, and is still traumatised.\n\"Sometimes now I start crying without any reason,\" she says. \"Sometimes I don't want to open my eyes because I think I'm still there. The memory of the jail is with me every moment.\"\nShe described interrogations that lasted from 08:00 until night-time.\n\"It is called 'white torture' and it is worse than a thousand beatings. They would threaten and humiliate me. But I would mock them.\"\nAnd despite all that she's already endured, Azad's still willing to risk jail again by going out without the hijab.\n\"After we lost Mahsa Amini, I promised myself that I will not wear the hijab, or ever buy another one for myself or anyone else,\" she says. \"Every change has a price. And we're ready to pay it.\"\nMany women in Iran now go out without a headscarf, although some have one around their necks in case they're stopped by the morality police.\nBut I've been told that around one in five is not wearing one at all - in a daily act of bravery, defiance and principle.\n\"I will never give up,\" Azad messages me - followed by a heart emoji and a victory sign.\n'I'm not allowed to go to work without the hijab'\nBut another woman I speak to in Tehran describes herself now as \"worn out\" by the struggle against the regime.\nBahareh, a 39-year old reporter and film critic, has taken a massive salary cut to work from home, rather than going into her office - where she would be forced to wear the veil.\n\"I'm tired and disappointed,\" she tells me. \"I'm not allowed to go to work without the hijab and I'm not willing to wear it.\"\nShe now has to rely on her husband's salary.\nRecently, while out driving without a headscarf, she was stopped by the police and had her car confiscated.\nShe was also arrested late last year, after posting pictures of herself without the hijab on her Instagram account and encouraging others to do the same. A Revolutionary Court gave her a six-month suspended sentence and a fine.\n\"I was insulted and threatened, told I was wrong and accused of inciting people to revolution and nakedness.\"\nI ask Bahareh why she thinks she wasn't actually jailed.\n\"Because the prisons are full of people and they prefer just to scare people like me,\" she replies.\n\"I still go out, but it's difficult because restaurants and cafes and bookstores can be closed down for letting me in without the hijab,\" she says. \"It makes me feel very bitter.\"\nWe agree to delete our conversation as soon as we finish it, such is her fear of being caught talking to me. \"Then I will block you,\" she messages. \"I have no choice. If I am arrested no-one can help me and I will be accused of spying and sentenced to deat",

    "An American company has made history by becoming the first commercial outfit to put a spacecraft on the Moon.\nHouston-based Intuitive Machines landed its Odysseus robot near the lunar south pole.\nIt took some minutes for controllers to establish that the craft was down, but eventually a signal was received.\n\"What we can confirm, without a doubt, is our equipment is on the surface of the Moon and we are transmitting,\" flight director Tim Crain announced.\nStaff at the company cheered and clapped at the news.\nIt was an important moment, not just for the commercial exploitation of space but for the US space programme in general.\nIntuitive Machines has broken the United States' half-century absence from the Moon's surface. You have to go back to the last Apollo mission in 1972 for an occasion when American hardware nestled down gently in the lunar soil.\nThe US space agency Nasa had purchased room on Odysseus for six scientific instruments, and its administrator Bill Nelson was quick to add his congratulations to Intuitive Machines for a mission he described as a \"triumph\".\n\"The US has returned to the Moon,\" he said. \"Today, for the first time in the history of humanity, a commercial company - an American company - launched and led the voyage up there. And today is the day that shows the power and promise of Nasa's commercial partnerships.\"\nControllers had to deal with an almost mission-stopping technical problem even before the descent began.\nOdysseus' ranging lasers, which were supposed to calculate the craft's altitude and velocity, weren't working properly.\nFortunately, there were some experimental lasers from Nasa on board, and engineers were able to patch these across to the navigation computers.\nOdysseus touched down at 23:23 GMT. At first, there was no signal at all from the robot. There were plenty of nerves as the minutes ticked by, but eventually a communications link was made, albeit a faint one.\nThis led to some concerns about the status of the lander. Within a couple of hours, however, Intuitive Machines was reporting that Odysseus was standing upright and sending back data, including pictures.\nThe targeted landing site was a cratered terrain next to a 5km-high mountain complex known as Malapert. It's the southernmost point on the Moon ever visited by a spacecraft, at 80 degrees South.\nIt's on the shortlist of locations where Nasa is considering sending astronauts later this decade as part of its Artemis programme.\nThere are some deep craters in this region that never see any sunlight - they're permanently in shadow - and scientists think frozen water could be inside them.\n9 Amazing Space Missions\nFrom a commercial moon mission by Intuitive Machines to Nasa's mini helicopter on Mars: 9 amazing space missions.\nAvailable now on BBC iPlayer\n\"The ice is really important because if we can actually take advantage of that ice on the surface of the Moon, that's less materials we have to bring with us,\" explained Lori Glaze, Nasa's director of planetary science.\n\"We could use that ice to convert it to water - drinkable drinking water - and we can extract oxygen and hydrogen for fuel and for breathing for the astronauts. So it really helps us in human exploration.\"\nNasa's six payloads on board Odysseus are a mix of technology demonstration and science.\nA key investigation will be one looking at the behaviour of lunar dust, which the Apollo astronauts found to be a serious nuisance, scratching and clogging their equipment.\nThe agency's scientists want to understand better how the dust is kicked up by landing craft to hang just above the surface before then settling back down.\nThe six commercial payloads on board include a student camera system from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which should have been deployed from Odysseus when it was still 30m above the lunar surface.\nThis system was designed to take selfie images as the robot set itself down.\nAmerican artist Jeff Koons has also attached a box to the side of the lander that contains 125 small stainless steel balls to represent the Moon's different phases through a month.\nPrior to Intuitive Machines' success, only government space agencies had put spacecraft down softly on the Moon - the US, the Soviet Union, China, India and Japan.\nIn January, another American company, Astrobotic, had a go.

    "An effectively bankrupt council in Surrey is to sell off affordable homes in an attempt to stay afloat.\nWoking Borough Council previously imposed emergency spending restrictions on itself due to its \u00c2\u00a32bn debt .\nAll spending for non-essential services was halted after the Section 114 notice was issued.\nCouncillors voted to strip 39 affordable homes from its Sheerwater regeneration project and sell them on the open market.\nThe decision, which means there will be 68 affordable homes in the block instead of 107, was made by the council in an attempt to keep its flagship housing project financially viable.\nAs a result, every three-bed, two-bed and non-specialist one-bed property will be put on the market.\nThe decision has led to criticism that the borough's best chance to alleviate the housing shortage will be lost.\n\"This is another big casualty of this financial mess we have,\" Councillor Tahir Aziz said.\n\"It's sad. It's another setback we are having in Sheerwater.\"\nThe homes are to be offered to Thameswey, a private company created by the council to handle Woking's regeneration projects.\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "A Palau-flagged, British-owned cargo ship was damaged and a minor injury was reported in the Gulf of Aden after it was hit by two missiles launched by Yemen's Houthis, the US military says.\nThe Islander is continuing its voyage following the attack south-east of the Yemeni port city of Aden.\nUK maritime authorities said the missiles caused a fire on board.\nA Houthi spokesman confirmed they had targeted the Islander and said they had also launched drones at a US warship.\nThe Houthis, who are backed by Iran and control much of north-western Yemen, have been attacking merchant vessels in the region since November.\nThey say their attacks are a show of support for the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nUS and British warships have been deployed as part of an international task force to protect freedom of navigation and commercial shipping in the critical waterway, which accounts for about 12% of global seaborne trade.\nUS forces, occasionally backed by British warplanes, have also been striking Houthi military targets in Yemen in response to the attacks since mid-January, but so far the Houthis have not been deterred.\nThe US military's Central Command said in a statement on Thursday that between 04:30 and 05:30 (01:30-02:30 GMT) US aircraft and a coalition warship shot down six Houthi one-way attack unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, in the Red Sea.\nLater, between 08:30 and 09:45, the Houthis fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles from southern Yemen into the Gulf of Aden, it added.\n\"The missiles impacted MV Islander a Palau-flagged, UK-owned, cargo carrier causing one minor injury and damage. The ship is continuing its voyage.\"\nEarlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency reported that two missiles set ablaze a vessel - which it did not identify - about 70 nautical miles (130km) south-east of Aden. It said the vessel and crew were safe and proceeding to their next port of call.\nAccording to maritime security firm Ambrey the ship's AIS transponder gave its destination as \"Syrian crew on board\", but it appeared to be heading in the direction of the Red Sea from Thailand.\nThe Israeli military meanwhile said its air defence system had successfully intercepted a \"launch which was identified in the area of the Red Sea and was en route to Israel\".\nThe Houthi spokesman later confirmed they had launched missiles and drones at various targets in what it called the \"south of occupied Palestine\".\nIn a televised speech on Thursday afternoon, the Houthis' leader said a total of 48 ships had now been targeted and that 13 operations had been carried out in the past week because the US and UK had \"failed\".\n\"Operations in the Red and Arabian Seas, Bab al-Mandab Strait, and the Gulf of Aden are continuing, escalating, and effective,\" Abdul Malik al-Houthi declared.\nHe also announced that the Houthis had introduced \"submarine weapons\", which he described as \"worrying for the enemy\".\nOn Monday, the crew of a Belize-flagged, British-registered cargo vessel Rubymar had to abandon ship in the Bab al-Mandab Strait - which connects the Gulf of Aden with the Red Sea - after it was hit by a Houthi missile and started letting in water.\nImages of the ship from Wednesday, which were obtained by the BBC, showed the ship was down by the stern but had not sunk, as the Houthis initially claimed. It is carrying 22 tonnes of a fertiliser classified as \"very dangerous\".\nThe Houthis also said they had attacked two US-owned cargo ships in the Gulf of Aden on Monday. The US military confirmed that two missiles were fired at one of them, the Greek-flagged Sea Champion, which was able to continue its journey to Aden to deliver grain.\nThe US state department condemned the attacks as \"reckless and indiscriminate\", warning that they had delayed deliveries of critical humanitarian aid to Yemen, Sudan and Ethiopia.\nIt also said the US and its allies would continue to take \"appropriate action\".",

    "Top US lawmakers have vowed to avert a partial government shutdown ahead of a Friday deadline to approve funding.\n\"We will get the government funded,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after a meeting with President Joe Biden on Tuesday.\nDemocrats and Republicans have been far apart in the budget negotiations on border security and aid to Ukraine.\nRepublicans control the House by a slim majority, while Democrats hold the Senate by a single seat.\nThere have been 10 US government shutdowns or partial shutdowns over the past four decades.\nSpending bills to keep the US government open require buy-in from both parties in order to advance through both chambers to the president's desk.\nIf a deal is not reached, some government departments, including agencies that oversee agriculture, transportation and veterans affairs, will temporarily close by 12:01 on Saturday.\nOther federal funding, including defence spending and homeland security and state department budgets, will expire a week later. Past shutdowns have led to furloughs of government workers and the closure of national parks.\nPresident Biden met the top four lawmakers - Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries - at the White House on Tuesday to discuss the effort to keep the government open.\n\"It's Congress' responsibility to fund the government,\" Mr Biden said at the start of the meeting. \"A shutdown would damage the economy significantly, and I think we all agree to that, and we need a bipartisan solution.\"\nSenator McConnell told reporters at the Capitol they had made \"some real headway\".\nSenator Schumer said the meeting at the White House was \"passionate\". \"It's in his hands,\" he said of Mr Johnson.\nThe Speaker is expected to put forward legislation in the coming days to keep the government open, though the details were uncertain.\nMr Johnson might offer to push back the deadline to 22 March, which would require another short-term continuing resolution (CR) to give legislators more time.\nIt was still being discussed as an option and was not finalised, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported.\nThe Speaker faces fierce objections from right-wing lawmakers in his ranks who want spending cuts and insist any further support for Ukraine should be tied to more money for US border security.\nThose same members booted out the previous Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, in October, after they were angered by a short-term budget deal that Mr McCarthy made with Democrats.\nA defence spending package including aid for Ukraine and Israel has passed the Senate, but Mr Johnson has so far resisted a vote on it in the House.",
    "Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has rejected the SNP's request for an emergency debate on Gaza.\nSir Lindsay said he understood the government was \"ready to make a relevant statement\" on Tuesday so there were other opportunities for MPs to discuss the issue.\nIt comes after last week's debate on SNP calls for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict ended in chaos .\nThe SNP said Westminster was \"failing the people of Gaza by blocking a vote\".\nThe party had requested a fresh debate on a motion which would mandate the government to take concrete steps to make a ceasefire happen, including using its position on the United Nations Security Council to vote for an immediate ceasefire and halting the sale of arms to Israel.\nHowever, the Speaker said that under Commons rules an emergency debate had to be on an issue ministers had responsibility for, and there must be no other way MPs could discuss it.\nSir Lindsay told MPs the SNP's application for a debate did not meet either criteria.\n\"That decision, of course, does not mean that members cannot apply for a debate at a later stage when circumstances might have changed,\" he added.\nIn response, SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said in a statement: \"For months, the UK Parliament has blocked SNP calls for an immediate ceasefire - and now it's blocking a vote on the concrete actions the UK government must pursue to make an immediate ceasefire more likely.\"\nHe said the \"inexplicable decision\" would \"further erode trust in the Speaker\".\nSir Lindsay provoked anger from SNP and Conservative MPs when he broke with convention last week to allow a vote on a Labour amendment to the SNP's motion calling for an immediate ceasefire.\nIt meant the SNP's motion, which was originally meant to be the focus of the debate, was not voted on.\nThis led to calls from the SNP - and some Conservatives - for Sir Lindsay to resign.\nSince then, the number of MPs declaring no confidence in him as Speaker has risen to 80 .\nSir Lindsay, who has already apologised for his handling of the issue, had previously indicated he would allow a fresh debate under emergency rules.\nMr Flynn said: \"The Speaker broke the rules last week - and this week he has broken his word.\n\"How can MPs have any trust in the Speaker when he makes a public commitment one minute, only to rip it up the next.\"\nLast week, Sir Lindsay had argued that allowing a vote on Labour's amendment meant MPs could express their views on the \"widest range of propositions\",  helping to protect them from threats to their safety amid heightened scrutiny over their stance on the conflict.\nHowever, the decision meant Labour avoided a potentially damaging rebellion over whether it supported the SNP's ceasefire call, which went further by calling for an end to the \"collective punishment of the Palestinian people\".\nThis led to accusations, which have been denied by the party and Sir Lindsay, that Labour had put pressure on the Speaker over the decision.",
    "A mimic from satirical TV puppet show Spitting Image has told how the show changed his life.\nSpeaking on the show's 40th anniversary, actor and comedian Jon Culshaw said: \"It was a game-changer for my career.\"\n\"It was my first job in television,\" said Culshaw, 55, who joined in 1994, but had always been a fan.\n\"It was the place I aspired to work, I wanted to join that team. When I had that chance I was so grateful.\"\nThe Lancashire-born and Wigan-educated star of BBC's Dead Ringers told Radio Manchester of the impact of joining a show which was appointment viewing after its debut in February 1984.\n\"It meant moving down to London, it meant working on TV alongside people like Kate Robbins, Alistair McGowan and John Thomson - it was so inspiring,\" he said.\nThe actor, from Ormskirk, added: \"We used to record on Tuesday and Thursday - it was a wonderful way to get your news and sum up the week's news with wonderful satire, great satire.\n\"We were handed a script and we were assigned our voices - I can remember being asked to do Chris Eubank [the boxer] and as I began speaking like him I developed gesticulations as well,\" the star recalled.\nCulshaw added his first sketch was Tory cabinet minister Michael Portillo, with broadcaster Terry Christian another character he was given soon after.\n\"You saw the puppet in your mind's eye - their caricatures were so extreme and so gargoyle-like - they really went to these great extremes and the puppet was the first comment on the person or situation in the news.\n\"Because the puppets were so huge and grotesque, the voices had to be as well.\"\nNo public figure was spared, from Queen Elizabeth to Pope John Paul II.\nCulshaw played Prime Minister John Major, with one line, \"more peas, Norma\", spoken as the puppets Mr Major and his wife ate a meal, becoming a national catchphrase.\nThe show launched the careers of performers such as Steve Coogan and Harry Enfield along with writers such as Private Eye editor Ian Hislop.\nPoliticians were shown no mercy, particularly Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher along with the political alliance between the SDP and the Liberal Party.\nCulshaw said: \"David Steel [Liberal leader] wasn't too keen as he was always shown as a small puppet inside the pocket of David Owen [SDP leader].\"\nThe performer said the show became a national institution which he was proud to be a part of.\n\"Because it went out on a Sunday night, I always saw it as a last bit of fun you wring out of the weekend, the last hurrah before school, college or work - everybody was talking about it the next day.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Visitors from China have claimed they were banned from a German military plane at a recent airshow, prompting an apology from manufacturer Airbus.\nThe incident allegedly took place at the Singapore Airshow, one of the region's largest exhibitions of commercial and military aviation.\nThe claims have gone viral on Chinese social media, sparking controversy.\nGerman officials have yet to comment. Airbus said it was sorry for \"any inconvenience caused\".\nIn one widely-circulated video filmed by a Chinese blogger on the weekend, a woman wearing Airbus identification is seen asking him for his nationality.\nThe man was attempting to enter an Airbus A400M transport aircraft owned by the German air force, the Luftwaffe.\nThe woman tells him that she needs to check his nationality \"because it is a German aircraft\".\nWhen he tells her that he is Chinese, she immediately refuses him entry, saying \"it's German rules, it's military restrictions\".\nA BBC review found that several aspects of the video, including the planes seen in the background and the woman's ID, appeared genuine.\nOther Chinese visitors have also claimed online that they were not allowed on the plane.\nAnother blogger said he was chased away by German military staff, and that he had lodged an official complaint with the airshow's organisers alleging \"discrimination against Chinese people\".\nCommenters on Weibo pointed out that Chinese visitors were allowed to visit other countries' military aircraft, and lambasted Airbus and the German military.\nWhen approached by the BBC, a representative at the German embassy in Singapore referred reporters to Airbus as they were \"responsible for security and managing the entrance\" to the plane. He did not respond to questions about the allegations regarding German military staff.\nAirbus declined to comment on the video.\nBut the European plane manufacturer told the BBC they were aware that some visitors at the Singapore Airshow had \"raised questions about access\" to the A400M plane.\n\"We immediately communicated and coordinated with the customer and our Airbus teams at the show to ensure that the aircraft was open to all visitors for the remainder of the airshow. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused,\" they said.\nAirbus posted a similar apology on its official Weibo account.\nThe BBC has also contacted the airshow's organisers and the Chinese bloggers for comment.\nAirbus touts the A400M as the most advanced \"airlifter\" military transport plane available. It can deliver troops into small unprepared airstrips in the battlefield as well as send large equipment to bases, while also acting as a mid-air refuelling tanker.\nThe incident comes amid increasing European concern of Chinese state access to Western military technology.\nThe President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen last year warned against European technology enhancing China's military capacities.\nAdditional reporting by Fan Wang.",

    "During the 1970s, hundreds of deceased miners had their lungs removed and passed on for medical research. Was this done without the consent of miners or their bereaved families?\nBlack lung disease, formally known as pneumoconiosis, is a horrible condition caused by inhaling coal dust.\n\"It was really bad,\" ex-coalminer Michael Quinn recalls, memories flashing of seeing his colleagues left unable to breathe.\nHis friend and fellow former miner David Cradduck nods in agreement, adding: \"It wasn't really talked about, it was worried about.\n\"Everybody thought 'I don't want to catch that'.\n\"But it was just looked on as an occupational hazard.\"\nDuring the 1960s alone, some 16,000 miners were certified as having the condition across Great Britain.\nMichael and David, who worked at the Haig Colliery in Whitehaven, Cumbria, know many miners who were struck down by black lung.\nIn a bid to learn more about the disease, the National Coal Board started a major research project which in part relied upon inspecting the lungs of dead miners.\nChris Fairbairn, who worked in the mortuary of Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital, can remember being asked to help preserve organs.\n\"If [the deceased] was a miner with black lung, we'd take the lungs out and set them up in a preservative,\" Chris, who now lives in Canada, says.\n\"I was told that every three or four months, a panel from the National Coal Board would come and do their dissecting and then they'd say 'thank you' and leave,\" he adds.\nRecords of post-mortem examinations and inquests from the 1970s show references to lungs and hearts being kept to be examined by so-called Pneumoconiosis Medical Panels (PMPs).\nThere were nine such panels made up of clerical assistants and medical officers. They were overseen by the then-Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) to assess miners' conditions and determine their entitlement to pensions and benefits.\nWhen a miner died and it was suspected they had pneumoconiosis, local coroners in England and Wales were required to inform the PMPs when and where a post-mortem examination would be taking place.\nAt the government's request, thoracic organs such as the lungs and hearts were then made available to the panels for further analysis.\nBruce, who worked as a clerical assistant for a panel in the mid '70s and asked the BBC not to use his surname, remembers lungs and hearts coming into the office.\n\"They would come in via a courier in a sealed polythene bag,\" he says, adding they would then be repacked and sent on for further study to hospitals, research departments or the Department of Health.\nSuch handling of organs was ruled over by the 1961 Human Tissue Act.\nUnder that act, where a person had not specifically stated their body could be used for research, their bereaved family would have to consent, according to Sir Jonathan Montgomery, Professor of Health Care Law at University College London.\nRecords at the National Archives in Kew contain letters about the practice, with references to studies by the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) in Edinburgh.\nThe IOM was set up by the coal board to study lung diseases in miners, with one study published in 1979 based on organs from 500 miners from across England, Scotland and Wales who had taken part in a Pneumoconiosis Field Research (PFR) study.\nMost of the organs were supplied by the PMPs, but some also came directly from pathology departments at six hospitals, including West Cumberland.\nWest Cumberland said it could not provide any information around the study or how consent was gathered, as its records did not go back that far.\nThe Trusts responsible for the other hospitals, Ballochmyle Hospital in Ayrshire, Sunderland General Hospital, and Burnley General, said similar.\nCoventry and Warwickshire Hospital also could not provide further detail, but it was operated by a different trust at that time.\nNorthumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said while it had no knowledge of the studies and involvement of Ashington Hospital, it was aware of and regrets the distress that such historical UK wide research practices have had on relatives of the deceased.\nThe IOM said it was unable to comment as it did not have the information available due to records being destroyed after 15 years.\nProfessor Anthony Seaton, who was the IOM's director in the late 1970s, said: \"I can't say in individual cases but consent from the relatives was given to allow a post-mortem examination which would, in those days, have implied removal of organs for examination and, if no disapproval had been announced, their use in teaching and research.\n\"So there was an overall belief at the time that organs removed at autopsy with proper permission could be used.\"\n'Ethical purpose'\nMeeting minutes from the IOM also reveal that the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) were approached to help in obtaining lungs, and it agreed.\nThe NUM said it could not find any specific reference to indicate that the union were aware of or endo",

    "Model Pattie Boyd is selling letters that lift the lid on her notorious love triangle with guitarist Eric Clapton and Beatles star George Harrison.\nBoyd was a muse to both men in the 1960s and 70s, inspiring Harrison's classic song Something and Clapton's hits Wonderful Tonight and Layla.\nInitially married to the Beatle, she was pursued by his close friend Clapton in a series of passionate love letters.\nNow she is auctioning notes from both men, along with other possessions.\nThe sale will take place at Christie's in London next month, with the items on public view from 15 to 21 March.\nBoyd met the Beatles when she was cast in their 1964 film A Hard Day's Night and instantly felt a connection with Harrison, their famously \"quiet\" guitarist.\n\"He was quite shy, like me. I think that's why we got on,\" she said in an interview published on the website of auction house Christie's.\nThey dated for two years before marrying in January 1966, during which time the Beatles were often away on tour,\n\"George was so adorable when he was away,\" she said. \"He missed me, and I missed him terribly, and he would write amazing letters and wonderful postcards.\"\nOne note in the auction sees Harrison write: \"Hope you're OK. I miss you. I'm starving - many grilled cheese sandwiches. Love you.\"\nClapton was a frequent guest at the couple's house in Surrey but, unbeknown to Harrison, harboured feelings for Boyd.\n'Is there is still a feeling in your heart for me?'\nIn 1970, he sent her a letter in impeccably neat, angular longhand. \"I am writing this letter to you, with the main purpose of ascertaining your feelings towards a subject well known to both of us,\" it began.\n\"What I wish to ask you is if you still love your husband?\" he continued. \"All these questions are very impertinent, I know, but if there is still a feeling in your heart for me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you must let me know!\"\n\"Don't telephone! Send a letter... That is much safer.\"\nBoyd initially thought the letter was from a fan, only realising the truth when Clapton phoned her later that day.\nA second letter was written several months later, on a page Clapton had torn from a copy of John Steinbeck's novel Of Mice and Men.\n'Take me, I am yours'\n\"Dear Layla,\" Clapton began, using his nickname for Boyd. \"Why do you hesitate, am I a poor lover, am I ugly, am I too weak, too strong, do you know why?\n\"If you want me, take me, I am yours\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if you don't want me, please break the spell that binds me. To cage a wild animal is a sin, to tame him is divine. My love is yours.\"\nHe later wrote the rock standard Layla for Boyd.\n\"It was so beautiful and so magical,\" Boyd recalled. \"I was so flattered, but I was also so worried that George would work out why Eric had written this song.\"\nBoyd originally rebuffed Clapton's advances but, after her marriage faltered in the early 1970s, the musician invited Boyd to join him on tour.\nTheir romance flourished and they married in 1979 - with the blessing of Harrison, who took to calling Clapton his \"husband-in-law\".\nUltimately, however, Clapton's alcoholism and infidelity undermined the marriage, and they divorced in 1989.\nBoyd, the daughter of a retired RAF bomber pilot, was a famous fashion model in the 1960s before turning her attention to photography.\nShe will sell her memorabilia including letters, paintings, photographs, jewellery and fashion next month.\nAmong the lots is a doodle by Harrison, in which he drew himself sitting beneath an apple tree, and a Christmas card he made for her in 1968.\n\"I've had them all for so many years - far too long,\" Boyd, who turns 80 this year, told The Telegraph . \"I thought, why don't I just sell everything and let everybody else enjoy it?\"\nThe sale will be led by the the painting La jeune fille au bouquet by Emile Th\u00c3\u00a9odore Frandsen de Schomberg - which served as the cover for the 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs by Clapton's band Derek and the Dominoes.\nClapton had originally bought the painting from the artist's son because the model's blonde hair and alluring almond eyes reminded him of Boyd. It is expected to sell for between \u00c2\u00a340,000 and \u00c2\u00a360,000.\nBoyd told the Telegraph she sought Clapton's permission before selling the possessions.\n\"He asked if I was selling the Layla painting, and I said yes,\" she said. \"He said, 'Maybe there are other things you could sell as well.' So he's absolutely fine with me auctioning everything.\"",

    "Some parents cannot cope with further strikes that disproportionately affect pupils at special schools, the mother of a child with autism has said.\nLouise Sadlier's nine-year-old son Fionn is among children who have missed several days of school this academic year because of industrial action.\n\"Our children's lives are routine-based and these strikes just threw everything up in the air,\" she told BBC News NI.\nShe joined a protest on Monday to call for better pay for school workers.\nStormont's Department of Education said the resolution of industrial action was \"a priority\" for the Education Minister Paul Givan and he had recently met unions to discuss the issue.\nMonday's protest outside Stormont was organised by the Colin Autism Advice and Support group, based in west Belfast.\nIts aim was to highlight failures in the special educational needs (SEN) sector and their impact on vulnerable pupils and their families, who are left to cope alone on strike days.\n\"We can't go through any more days off,\" Ms Sadlier told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme .\nShe explained Fionn is an intelligent boy who noticed that his special school in Lisburn was forced to shut on several occasions, while neighbouring mainstream schools remained open.\n\"The local mainstream school is at the bottom of the street,\" she explained.\n\"So Fionn can then see the other children going to school and he's like: \"Why am I not going to school?\"\nThe disruption had a negative impact on her son's behaviour as he found it difficult to cope without regular support from his teachers and school staff.\n\"Fionn sets timers for everything so when that routine is broken it has a very, very bad effect on him,\" his mother explained.\n\"Whenever he's not in school during the week he kicks off and that has an effect on his eating and his sleeping.\"\nMembers of the support group have said the ongoing threat of further strike action is having a serious impact on their children's education and their families' livelihoods.\nThe organisation supports about 1,000 people in west Belfast.\nOver the past few months, teaching unions across Northern Ireland have staged strikes over pay which resulted in intermittent closures for all schools.\nBut there were additional closures for special schools where educational support staff, including bus drivers, canteen workers and classroom assistants also staged strikes over pay.\nMs Sadlier said pay claims should be settled for staff who look after pupils like her son.\n\"They are absolute angels and they go above and beyond for our children and they just deserve fair pay,\" she said.\nShe added that her message to politicians at Stormont would be: \"You get paid, so pay them.\"\nDeborah Maguire, from the Colin Autism Advice and Support group, has a seven-year-old son with severe learning difficulties.\n\"It's got to the stage that all SEN parents have given up hope,\" she said.\n\"Unless this is included in the 2024 budget it won't happen this year and that will mean 12 months of more failure.\"\nPoliticians at Stormont will debate a motion from the Alliance Party on Monday which calls for better investment in special needs education.\nPay and grading review delay\nThe issue was discussed on BBC News NI's Sunday Politics programme, which heard from members of Stormont's education committee.\nIts chair Nick Mathison, from Alliance, said recent strikes by school support workers had shown \"our education system doesn't function without these staff\".\nHe said pupils with special educational needs \"have a right to expect the very best educational system to serve them\".\nMr Mathison added that the issue of pay and grading for school support staff \"cannot be put to the side\" because special schools cannot open their doors without them.\nThe committee's deputy chair, Pat Sheehan of Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in, said there had been an underfunding of the system for many years as a result of \"12 or 13 years of Tory austerity\" but he added it needed to be \"resolved as a matter of priority\".\n\"But the other issue is that the business case of the pay and grading review is currently back with the Department of Education,\" Mr Sheehan told the programme.\n\"It had previously gone to the Department of Finance, apparently they weren't satisfied with the business case and it went back.\n\"It's up to the education department now to work on that as soon as possible and get their ducks in a row and get it up to the Department of Finance.\"\nMr Sheehan said that he was \"confident\" that his Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in colleague, Finance Minister Caoimhe Archibald, would \"look at it very positively when she gets it\".\nIn a statement to BBC News NI on Monday afternoon, a

    "French President Emmanuel Macron has said it is key for Europe's security to defeat Russia in Ukraine, amid urgent pleas for more weapons from Kyiv.\nHe was speaking in Paris where he said that European leaders had agreed to set up a coalition to give Ukraine medium- and long-range missiles and bombs.\nHe added that there was \"no consensus\" on sending Western troops to Ukraine, but that \"nothing should be excluded\".\nRussian troops have recently made gains in Ukraine which faces arms shortages.\nKyiv is critically dependent on modern armoury supplies from its Western allies, particularly the US, to be able to continue fighting Russia - a far bigger military force with an abundance of artillery ammunition.\nBut the approval of a much needed $95bn (\u00c2\u00a375bn) US aid package - including $61bn for Ukraine - faces an uphill battle in the House of Representatives.\nLast weekend, Ukraine's defence minister said half of all Western aid for Kyiv had been delayed, costing lives and territory.\nIn response to Mr Macron, a spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said his government had no plans for a large-scale military deployment to Ukraine, beyond the small number of personnel already training Ukrainian forces.\nGermany, Sweden, Poland and the Czech Republic have also ruled out such suggestions.\nOn Friday, Hungary blocked a statement sent to EU member countries by the European Council President Charles Michel, pledging \"unwavering\" support for Ukraine.\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban - the only EU leader who maintains warm relations with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - has been repeatedly at odds with the bloc over measures to help Kyiv since Russia's invasion.\nOn Tuesday, Hungary's foreign minister reiterated that Budapest is not willing to send weapons or troops to Ukraine.\nPeter Szijjarto said: \"The war in Ukraine must be finished, not expanded.\"\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called Mr Macron's suggestion \"a very important new element\" adding it was absolutely not in the interests of Nato members.\n\"In that case, we would need to talk not about the probability, but about the inevitability [of direct conflict]\", said Mr Peskov.\nEarlier, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg denied considering whether troops would be sent to Ukraine, although he insisted the alliance would continue to support Kyiv strongly.\nAs Kyiv struggles to secure more aid and weapons to continue fighting Russia, the Kremlin's need for extra ammunition has reportedly taken it to an unlikely player in this war.\nSouth Korea says that North Korea has shipped as many as three million shells to Russia, for use in its war in Ukraine. Its defence minister, Shin Won-sik, said that in return, Moscow had sent thousands of containers of food.\nBoth Moscow and Pyongyang deny North Korea is supplying Russia with munitions.\nA full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin is now in its third year, with no signs that the biggest war in Europe since World War Two could end soon.\nMonday's crisis meeting in support of Ukraine was attended by heads of European states, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and top government officials like UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron.\nDelegations from the US and Canada were also present.\nPresident Macron said: \"We are convinced that the defeat of Russia is indispensable to security and stability in Europe.\"\nDescribing Russia as the \"sole aggressor\", he said, \"We are not at war with the Russian people. We just don't want to let them win.\".\nMr Macron announced that a coalition would provide Ukraine with \"missiles and bombs of medium and long range to carry out deep strikes\". He did not say when such weapons would be delivered.\nAnd he did not rule out sending Western ground troops to Ukraine but acknowledged that differences remained among the allies.\n\"There was no consensus today to send troops on to the ground in an manner that's official, assumed and endorsed,\" he said. \"But on the dynamic, nothing should be excluded. We will do everything so that Russia cannot win this war.\"\n\"We should not exclude that there might be a need for security that then justifies some elements of deployment,\" he added. \"But I've told you very clearly what France maintains as its position, which is a strategic ambiguity that I stand by.\"\nCzech Prime Minister Petr Fiala earlier said his country had no intention of deploying its forces to fight in Ukraine.\nHe was reacting to comments by his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico, who was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying: \"I can confirm there are countries that are prepared to send their own troops to Ukraine, there are countries that say never, among which Slovakia belongs, and there are countries that say this proposal needs to be considered.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also took part in Monday's meeting by video link, said that \"everything we do together to defend against Russian aggression adds real security to our nations for decades to come\".\nRus",
    "More mortgage providers will increase their rates on new fixed deals on Friday following a series of changes since the start of the year.\nJanuary saw lenders cutting their rates sharply, bringing some relief to 1.6 million people set to remortgage this year.\nBut higher costs faced by providers to fund mortgage lending means many have raised rates again in recent days.\nHSBC, NatWest and Virgin Money are all increasing the cost of new deals.\nThis will mean the end of widely available five-year fixed deals with a rate of less than 4%. The average rate on all new fixed deals has been edging higher recently as lenders have altered their pricing.\n\"This may catch some borrowers by surprise when the rate story this year has generally been one of falling rates,\" said David Hollingworth, from broker London and Country.\nHe said lenders had been shifting rates regularly. They are responding to the view of investors who now expect the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee to make fewer, and later, changes its base rate of 5.25% this year than previously anticipated. Cuts in this rate makes borrowing less expensive.\nThe interest rate on a fixed mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it. Doing nothing would leave people on a variable rate, which is very expensive.\nAbout 1.6 million existing borrowers have relatively cheap fixed-rate deals expiring this year.\nSantander, Coventry Building Society and TSB all raised rates on new fixed deals earlier in the week.\n\"HSBC's best buy deals were never going to last long once Santander pushed up its fixed rates,\" said Aaron Strutt, of mortgage broker Trinity Financial.\n\"While they have gone up, [deals] are still reasonably priced. Some lenders now offer two-year fixed-rates priced around 4.4% and five-year fixes priced around 4.2%.\n\"Lenders have had a busy start to the year and the property market has really picked up. These rate hikes may well start to knock the property sector again if they continue.\"\nAndrew Montlake, managing director of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: \"There is massive sense of deja vu as several mainstream lenders have increased their rates with little notice in a throwback to the dark days of 2023.\n\"This all makes life extremely difficult for those trying to find a new mortgage, as once again, quick decisions are needed or carefully worked out budgets need to be revisited, which can sometimes mean the difference between obtaining their dream home or not.\"\nHowever, there are signs of lenders failing to settle on where rates should be set. Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, is cutting the rates on some of its deals on Friday.\n\"I expect there will still be plenty of jockeying for position as the market remains extremely competitive but in the short term we may still see more movement in mortgage rates,\" Mr Hollingworth said.\nWhat is happening with your mortgage?

    "A man stabbed his sister to death with a samurai sword a week after his son was jailed for murder.\nRoger Harriott, 56, killed Sandra Harriott outside the home she shared with their 80-year-old mother in Fartown, Huddersfield, in May 2023.\nThe attack happened eight days after his son Jovani Harriott was jailed for killing 15-year-old Khayri Mclean.\nHarriott was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 23 years, following a guilty plea.\nLeeds Crown Court heard Harriott had a \"toxic\" relationship with his sister, and they had previously fallen out over the care of their mother, who has Alzheimer's Disease.\nThree weeks before the murder Harriott had been arrested on suspicion of defrauding his mother, and told police that Ms Harriott \"would not be getting her hands on their mother's money\".\nThe court heard Ms Harriott had been \"living in fear\" of her brother since 2020, after a series of incidents in which he physically and verbally abused her.\nProsecutor David Hall said Ms Harriott carried a personal alarm as a result, and had taken out a non-molestation order in December 2022 which banned the defendant from coming near her or her home.\nHarriott was in breach of both this order and his bail conditions following his arrest for fraud, when he drove 10 miles (16km) from Bradford to Huddersfield on 26 May last year.\nThe court heard he waited outside Ms Harriott's house in Ripon Avenue before attacking her with a samurai sword.\nAttempts to resuscitate Ms Harriott, who had two adult sons, were unsuccessful and she died in hospital.\nMr Hall said the defendant immediately handed himself in to police, telling officers: \"I've just murdered someone - my dad's daughter, the weapon is in the car.\"\nGerald Hendron, representing Harriott, said he admitted he had intended to kill his sister but \"does genuinely regret his actions\".\nThe court heard the Office of the Public Guardian had raised concerns about 134 transactions from Harriott's mother's bank account, with withdrawals amounting to tens of thousands of pounds that \"bore no relation to (her) daily needs\".\nMr Hendron said his client was \"adamant\" that he had never \"acted dishonestly towards his mother\".\nFollowing the hearing on Friday, Det Supt Alan Weekes,\u00e2\u0080\u00afwho led the investigation,\u00e2\u0080\u00afsaid Harriott had used a \"shocking\" level of violence in his premediated attack.\n\"This was a\u00e2\u0080\u00afdreadful\u00e2\u0080\u00afoffence in which a woman going about her everyday business was attacked and murdered in the street in broad daylight,\" he said.\nJovani Harriott, then 17, and Jakele Pusey, then 15, fatally stabbed Khayri McLean after ambushing him outside North Huddersfield Trust School in 2022 and both were jailed for life last May .\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Alexei Navalny was about to be freed in a prisoner swap when he died, according to his colleague Maria Pevchikh.\nShe said the Russian opposition leader was going to be exchanged for Vadim Krasikov, a Russian hitman serving a life sentence for murder in Germany.\nTwo US citizens being held in Russia were also going to be part of the deal, Ms Pevchikh claimed.\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Financial Times he was \"not aware of such agreements\".\nBBC News has not seen any evidence for Ms Pevchikh's claims and is unable to independently verify them.\nMs Pevchikh said negotiations had been in their final stage on 15 February.\nNavalny died on 16 February in his cell in the prison colony in Siberia where he was being held on a 19-year sentence over charges that were widely seen as politically motivated.\nPrison officials said the 47 year old had fallen ill following a walk.\nIn a video posted on Navalny's YouTube channel, Ms Pevchikh, who is the chairwoman of his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), claimed negotiations for a prisoner swap had been under way for two years.\nShe added that, after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, \"it was clear that Putin would stop at nothing\" and that Navalny \"had to be freed from jail at any cost, and urgently\".\nAccording to Ms Pevchik, Navalny was going to be freed under a humanitarian exchange and US and German officials were involved in the talks.\nA spokesman for the German government said on Monday they were aware of reports on a planned prisoner swap, but refused to comment further.\nMs Pevchikh said a plan for the prisoner swap was finally reached in December,\nShe said Vadim Krasikov - a Russian who was found guilty of shooting former Chechen rebel commander Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in the head at close range in Germany in 2019 - was going to be part of the deal.\nTwo US nationals currently held in Russia were also going to be exchanged, Ms Pevchikh said.\nSeveral US nationals are currently being held in Russian jails, and Ms Pevchikh did not specify who would have been part of the alleged swap.\nEarlier in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin told US host Tucker Carlson that talks were ongoing with the US about freeing American journalist Evan Gershkovich, who is being held on espionage charges.\nMr Putin hinted that, in exchange, Russia would accept a person who \"due to patriotic sentiments, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 during the events in the Caucasus\" - almost certainly a reference to Krasikov.\nMs Pevchikh claimed Mr Putin changed his mind about the deal at the last minute, saying the Russian president \"could not tolerate Navalny being free\".\nIt is unclear why Mr Putin might have agreed to swapping Navalny for other prisoners.\nMr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov has previously said allegations of government involvement into Navalny's death were \"absurd\".\nAuthorities initially refused to hand Navalny's body over to his mother, only relenting eight days after his death.\nNavalny's widow, Yulia, has said he was killed on the orders of Mr Putin. The Kremlin has denied these allegations, calling Western reaction to the death \"hysterical\".\nOn Monday, Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmish posted a message on social media saying his allies were looking for a venue where supporters could hold a public farewell later this week.\nSuch an event is expected to be closely monitored by the authorities, provided it is allowed to go ahead at all.\nA rights group said 400 Russians were arrested across the country for laying flower tributes to Navalny following his death.",

    "The state of Alabama is seeking to execute a second inmate using nitrogen gas just weeks after becoming the first in the nation to use the controversial method.\nThe state's attorney general asked Alabama's Supreme Court to set an execution date for Alan Eugene Miller, who has been on death row since 2000.\nHe was convicted of killing three people in a workplace shooting.\nThe UN has condemned the nitrogen gas method as cruel.\nIn January, the state executed another inmate, Kenneth Eugene Smith, with nitrogen gas. According to reporters at the execution, Smith thrashed violently on the gurney before being pronounced dead 25 minutes later.\nWhile advocates have opposed the method, the state argued it was \"effective and humane\" and says Miller, 59, will be executed the same way.\nMiller was convicted of killing three people - Terry Jarvis, Lee Holdbrooks and Scott Yancy - in 1999 during workplace shootings in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\"It is once more the appropriate time for the execution of his sentence,\" Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement.\nMiller survived a previous execution attempt by lethal injection in September 2022 as it was called off when it could not be completed by a midnight deadline.\nFollowing the failed attempt, Miller filed a federal lawsuit that alleges prison staff, trying to find a vein, poked him with needles for over an hour and left him at one point hanging vertically as he lay strapped to a gurney.\nIn November 2022, the state agreed it would not use lethal injection in his execution but instead nitrogen gas.\nAhead of Kenneth Eugene Smith's January execution, the UN, the EU and anti-death penalty activists condemned the use of nitrogen gas for the death penalty. Smith was convicted in 1989 of murdering a preacher's wife, Elizabeth Sennett, in a killing-for-hire.\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said he had \"serious concerns this novel and untested method of suffocation by nitrogen gas may amount to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\".\nInhaling pure nitrogen gas cuts off the oxygen supply to the brain. The procedure had never been used before in an execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\nBesides Alabama, only two other states - Oklahoma and Mississippi - permit execution by nitrogen gas.\nThose states approved the use of nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative method of execution because the drugs used in lethal injections have become more difficult to find, contributing to a fall in the use of the death penalty nationally.",

    "A British charity set up nearly 40 years ago to improve understanding between faith groups has confirmed its closure after the government cut off funding.\nThe Inter Faith Network (IFN) says its board members met on Thursday and confirmed it was beginning the process to close the charity, though staff would continue working until mid-April.\nLast month, Communities Secretary Michael Gove said he was \"minded to withdraw\" government funding, worth around \u00c2\u00a3150,000, for the IFN after the appointment of Hassan Joudi, a former deputy secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), as a trustee.\nThe government has made no specific allegations against Mr Joudi other than his association with the MCB - a group the government refuses to engage with.\n\"The government has held a consistent policy of non-engagement with the Muslim Council of Britain,\" a spokesperson for the Communities Department told the BBC.\n\"Last year, an MCB member was appointed to the core governance structure of the Inter Faith Network. As a result, the government has decided to withdraw the offer of new funding.\"\nThe issue was raised in the Commons on Thursday, with several MPs urging the government to reconsider their decision.\nCommunities minister Felicity Buchan said the government would continue supporting other charities that promote interfaith dialogue, but told MPs the MCB member's appointment \"poses a reputational risk to government\".\nLabour's Sir Stephen Timms accused the government of shutting down the main forum for Muslim-Jewish dialogue in the UK at an \"extraordinarily stupid\" time, referencing that it came a day after the chaos in parliament over the Gaza vote .\nThe MCB is a broad representative body of British Muslims, with membership from more than 500 mosques, Muslim schools and charities.\nIn 2009, the Labour government broke ties with the MCB over accusations its leaders supported violence against Israel. However, Labour restored relations with the organisation in 2010.\nThough the charity's leadership has since changed, the current Conservative government has refused to engage with it.\n\"This has come completely out of the blue,\" says Rev Canon Hilary Barber, co-chair of the IFN.\n\"To my knowledge there have never been any conditions around funding to do with membership and trustees who sit on the board,\" he adds.\nMr Barber, who is also vicar of Halifax Minster, says the IFN has taken its responsibilities seriously when it comes to checking the credentials of trustees.\n\"We're a charitable trust, so the Charity Commission sets out very clear guidelines which the IFN has very carefully followed,\" he said. \"The success of the network for nearly 40 years is in the way it has been run which has been absolutely meticulous.\"\nThe IFN says its closure would have an impact on many long-standing projects up and down the country, designed to promote understanding about and between different faith groups and to encourage cooperation.\nZara Mohammed, general secretary of the MCB, said: \"When there is a real need for cohesion and for bringing people together, to withdraw funding for the Inter Faith Network for the reasons given is a shock.\n\"We have yet to receive a reason as to why the government doesn't want to engage at this point in time.\"\nWhile the IFN also raised funds through membership and donations, for more than 20 years it had grown through its partnership with the government. Mr Gove's department had advised that it looked for funds elsewhere.\n\"The Inter Faith Network cannot rely on continuous taxpayer funding,\" a Communities Department spokesperson said. \"We regularly remind our partners, including the IFN, of the importance of developing sustainable funding arrangements - rather than relying on taxpayers' money, which can never be guaranteed.\"\nAdditional reporting by Sara Monetta",

I was shocked to hear the news.\"\nBy Graeme Ogston, BBC Scotland News reporter in Aberfeldy\nThe long, quiet rugged path that leads from the main road to the scene of Brian Low's murder is dotted with just a handful of houses.\nBut few neighbours are willing to be identified or even to speak about the horror that is unfolding yards from their doorsteps.\nMr Low was seen locally walking his dog, and those who knew him (or knew of him) described him as \"the loveliest guy.\"\nAnd while there are few here and in nearby Aberfeldy saying they are openly worried about a killer on the loose, there is real concern that they are only hearing about Mr Low's murder 10 days after his body was found.\nA couple of people said they had heard last week that a local man had died walking his dog, but had assumed it had been a medical matter.\nSo there is real shock that an active murder inquiry is now taking place in their town, with uniformed and plain-clothes police very much out and about on the streets of Aberfeldy.\nDet Ch Insp Marin Macdougall, of Police Scotland's major investigation team (MIT) said extensive inquires were taking place.\nHe said: \"Since criminality was established on Friday evening, the MIT has carried out a number of lines of enquiry and we are keeping an open mind as to the motive in this case.\n\"We are now turning to the public for information. Aberfeldy is a remote area with close knit community. Anything unusual would stand out.\n\"I am asking anyone with information, if you noticed anything out of the ordinary or heard anything of concern, to please contact us. It could be vital to our investigation.\"\nLocal Area Commander Greg Burns said: \"I understand this is an extremely concerning incident for this small, rural community.\n\"I want to take this opportunity to reassure people that we are working round the clock to find out what happened to Brian.\n\"We will have additional high-visibility patrols in the area and you will see significant police activity over the coming days\".\nDetectives have set up an online portal where members of the public can submit information.",

    "A mother whose baby was stillborn at a Kent hospital in 2021 has said lessons haven't been learned after her ordeal.\nShona Pitt said she wasn't properly assessed when admitted to Tunbridge Wells Hospital and treatment delays may have contributed to her son's death.\nLast week, care inspectors rated the maternity service inadequate and demanded \"rapid improvements\".\nA spokesman for Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS (MTW) said it had improved training and adopted recommendations.\nMs Pitt, who was left traumatised by the birth, said she arrived at a birthing centre to find Leo's heartrate had dropped and was told she would have an emergency Caesarean.\nShe was transferred by ambulance to Tunbridge Wells Hospital but not given the Caesarean.\n\"I was pushed into a delivery room with no senior team to observe me, to check on Leo's heart rate to see if it had come back up to normal,\" she said.\nResuscitation attempts\nIn 2022, the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch examined Ms Pitt's case and made five safety recommendations.\nIts report found Ms Pitt was not reviewed by an obstetrician on admission to the labour ward.\nIt also found more delays were caused because staff were not trained in using fetal scalp electrodes, with a further shortage of obstetric support, and that concerns in the second stage of labour were not immediately escalated.\nIt said staff tried to resuscitate Leo but after 28 minutes, he was confirmed to have died.\nMs Pitt said: \"All I can remember is him being handed to me and saying 'I'm sorry'.\"\nShe said the trust should have used Leo's death to learn and make improvements.\nAn MTW spokeswoman said: \"Following an independent review of Leo's care, we apologised to his family.

    "A pair of acorns reportedly planted by John Lennon and Yoko Ono have gone on display after allegedly being stolen by a young fan 55 years ago.\nThe Beatles singer and his artist wife planted the acorns in the grounds of Coventry Cathedral in 1968, along with a wrought iron bench.\nA retired police officer, who found them in a box while tidying up, posted them to Liverpool Beatles Museum.\nThe \"living sculpture\" marked the start of the couple's campaign for peace.\nHowever, it reportedly caused upset with the cathedral authorities and within a week, the acorns had been stolen and Lennon had removed the bench.\nIt has now emerged that for 55 years, the acorns had been in the possession of former Warwickshire Police traffic sergeant Mike Davies.\nThe 88-year-old said they had been brought into Nuneaton police station by a man who was about 19 or 20, who had been caught drink-driving outside Bedworth a few days after the cathedral planting.\nHe said the driver, who looked like a \"typical lad about town\", and his girlfriend were Beatles fans who had returned to the cathedral after the planting ceremony and stolen the acorns, coating them in clear nail varnish to preserve them.\nHe added that because the acorns had no owner and, at the time, no value, he could not charge the couple with theft.\n\"They walked and the acorns were left,\" he said.\n\"It was no good taking them back and replanting them because they were covered in nail varnish so wouldn't grow.\n\"They were in my desk until I retired in 1980 when I put them in a cardboard box and that's where they remained until I decided to start clearing out my own personal things.\"\nHe said that when he came across them again last year, it took him a moment to remember what they were.\n\"They were two seconds off going in the waste bin when I thought 'that was John Lennon and Yoko Ono',\" he said.\nThe great-grandfather, from Nuneaton, said he was not a fan of The Beatles, and preferred the music of American tenor Mario Lanza.\nHowever, he said he found the details of the museum on Liverpool's Mathew Street online and decided \"for the sake of a stamp\" to post the acorns there to see if they were of interest.\nIn the accompanying letter, he told curators if they were not of interest, \"just bin them\".\n\"I certainly have no interest in them being returned,\" he added.\nThe acorns have now gone on show at the museum following an unveiling by Lennon's sister, Julia Baird.\nMuseum owner Roag Best, brother of the band's original drummer Pete, said John Lennon and Yoko Ono \"kicked off their whole peace movement with this art installation, where the acorns were planted\".\nLennon and Ono, who famously held \"bed-ins\" as part of their anti-war message, went on to send acorns to leaders across the world to promote peace.\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "TikTok says it has started removing more music from its platform as part of a continuing row over royalties with Universal Music Group (UMG).\nThe app has already silenced songs by artists signed to the label, but is now having to do the same with writers too.\nThis means that videos featuring songs by artists such as Harry Styles and Adele, who have written with Universal-signed artists, could soon be muted.\nTikTok says up to 30% of what it calls \"popular songs\" could be lost.\nBut some industry estimates say up to 80% of all music on TikTok could be muted.\nThat's because of something called \"split copyrights\". In other words, if a songwriter signed to Universal Music's publishing arm has contributed even a tiny part to a song, that entire recording will, in theory, have to come down.\nThat would include songs by artists on other labels, including the two remaining majors, Sony and Warner, and hundreds of independents.\nUniversal's music was licensed to TikTok until earlier this year - but they let the license lapse after failing to reach an agreement over how much the app should pay artists .\nAs a result, the label's recording catalogue, which is around three million songs, was removed at the start of February.\nThe publishing catalogue deal runs out at the end of the week, which means another four million songs are expected to be pulled from the platform.\nArtists and songwriters\nUniversal has accused TikTok of \"bullying\" them by wanting to pay a \"fraction\" of the rate other platforms do for their music.\nUMG says that just 1% of their total revenue comes from the platform, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, despite having more than one billion users.\nTikTok said Universal was presenting a \"false narrative and rhetoric\".\nMusic is a big part of the appeal of TikTok - content creators often add songs to their videos.\nThe app has also become a tool for artists to gain popularity and get their songs heard - there's even a TikTok Billboard top 50 chart in the US, which is calculated from user engagement.\nViral sensations\nSongs have been used to create viral moments like dance trends or challenges, popular musicians have embraced the platform to feel closer to fans and new artists have broken through to mainstream success as a result of it.\nMae Stephens, a 20-year-old from Kettering, quit her job at a supermarket and signed to a record label after her song If We Ever Broke Up went viral on TikTok.\nShe told the BBC, \"It's a bit of shock to be honest, I still can't believe everything that happened to me.\"\nThe row over royalties has raised concerns that artists who found a fanbase on TikTok before signing to a major label will no longer be able to capitalise on their following.\nCody Fry, an artist signed to a record label owned by UMG, said in a TikTok video he felt \"like a person standing between two colliding planets\" - having seen reports about the licensing agreement expiring just as one of his tracks was going viral in China.\nHe told the BBC that he thought TikTok should \"value music more than it does currently\" and he wished the two companies could have resolved their differences without \"leaving it to the expense of artists on the ground\".\nBut pop star Kim Petras, whose music has been muted on the platform, says she supports Universal's position.\n\"I feel very protected by Universal,\" she told the BBC last week . \"I know people who have number one records and can't afford their rent, so I'm proud Universal is taking a stand.\n\"Of course, right now, all of us Universal artists are screwed a little bit, but you've gotta take one for the team.

    "The \"aye\" and \"noe\" division lobbies in the House of Commons do not allow for nuance or subtlety.\nParliamentary procedure has no space for multiple choice answers.\nThat is what the Commons Speaker tried, and spectacularly failed, to create on Wednesday night as MPs debated the UK's response to the war between Israel and Hamas.\nAs he gave Labour MPs the chance to vote for a ceasefire with conditions attached, Sir Lindsay Hoyle anticipated it would be followed by a vote on the SNP motion, and then the government amendment too.\nBy pulling the plug on proceedings and allowing the Labour amendment to pass, the Conservatives scuppered the chance for the SNP to have a vote.\nThey also brought down the Speaker's plan to give each of the three biggest parties their chance to make clear exactly where they stand on a hugely divisive issue, in a context of growing concern about MPs' safety.\nIn recent weeks, the Conservative MP for Finchley and Golders Green Mike Freer has announced he will be standing down from Parliament after receiving death threats.\nA fellow Conservative MP, Tobias Ellwood, has spoken about protests outside his home over the situation in Gaza.\nLast November, the office of shadow Welsh secretary Jo Stevens was daubed in red paint and covered in posters which accused her of having \"blood\" on her hands after she abstained in a vote on a ceasefire.\nShadow Leader of the Commons Lucy Powell was reflecting these situations and more when she said in the Commons that MPs are working under a \"long shadow of threats, intimidation and security concerns\".\nIn his apology to MPs, the Speaker said \"the details of the things that have been brought to me are absolutely frightening\".\nThere is no doubt Speaker Hoyle takes MPs' safety seriously. He has previously suggested that the possibility of another violent attack on an MP keeps him awake at night.\nConservative MP Sir Charles Walker described it as an \"obsession\" that had \"clouded\" the Speaker's judgement when he chose to depart from normal procedure.\nBut those Conservative backbenchers now calling for the Speaker to go believe that changing the rules amounts to a concession to what they see as intimidating behaviour from some pro-Palestinian protesters.\nThe former attorney general, Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Cox, described it as \"abject surrender to intolerance and tyranny\", which \"offers up the House of Commons as able to be influenced by external threats\".\nLord Walney, the government's Independent Adviser on Political Violence and Disruption, told the BBC: \"It is extraordinarily serious to have a position where the events of our seat of democracy can be influenced by a sense of threat coming from outside.\n\"Be that from the angry crowd that was gathered around while the vote was taking place last night, or the increasing levels of intimidation that MPs are facing at their homes, outside their offices, going about their business.\n\"We can not tolerate this situation, we're all damaged by it if we do.\"\nOthers have warned there is a danger of conflating legitimate protest with threatening behaviour.\nThe left-wing campaign group Momentum released a statement saying it is \"vital that our elected representatives can fulfil their democratic mandates in safety\".\n\"It is wrong to conflate this safety with insulation from democratic accountability,\" a spokesperson added.\n'Not good enough'\nThe Metropolitan Police said their officers had facilitated the right to protest peacefully at the time of the vote, and no arrests were made.\nBut while the concern for MPs' safety has been heightened since the conflict in Gaza, this is far from the first time that MPs have faced binary choices where their preferred option might often be \"somewhere in between\".\nSpeaking to BBC Newscast, Hannah White from the Institute for Government said the procedure was \"more restrictive than optimal because it was developed when we only had two main parties in the House\".\nShe said: \"I do think there's an issue with the difficulty the House has in deciding anything other than binary questions.\n\"We saw it with House of Lords reform, we saw it with indicative votes on Brexit.\n\"If you have more than two options it's really difficult under parliamentary procedures to get a sensible way of deciding on those.\n\"And now that we have a third party in the House on a regular basis we need to recognise that and say procedures that only deal with two main parties are not good enough anymore.\"\nConservative MP Vicky Ford suggested an alternative course of action, arguing that MPs should be allowed to register a written explanation along side their votes, to explain why they have voted the way they have, as happens in the European Parliament.\nShe said a \"lack of transparency\" explaining why MPs vote a certain way was being \"wilfully used to drum up hatred\".\nThe leader of the Commons Penny Mordaunt described her suggestion as \"interesting\".\nAnd the wider question posed by Wednesday's events remains.

    "A power company that has received \u00c2\u00a36bn in UK green subsidies has kept burning wood from some of the world's most precious forests, the BBC has found.\nPapers obtained by Panorama show Drax took timber from rare forests in Canada it had claimed were \"no-go areas\".\nIt comes as the government decides whether to give the firm's Yorkshire site billions more in environmental subsidies funded by energy bill payers.\nDrax says its wood pellets are \"sustainable and legally harvested\".\nThe Drax Power Station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, is a converted coal plant which burns wood pellets. In 2023, it produced about 5% of the UK's electricity. The site has become a key part of the government's drive to meet its climate targets.\nIts owner, Drax, receives money from energy bill payers because the electricity produced from burning pellets is classified as renewable and treated as emission-free.\nIn fact, the power station emits about 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, but under international rules the UK doesn't have to count these emissions.\nAll of the 6.5 million tonnes of wood pellets burned by Drax each year are produced overseas. Many come from Drax's 17 pellet plants in the US and Canada.\nIn 2022, Panorama revealed the company had obtained logging licences in the Canadian province of British Columbia and filmed logs being taken from what the programme said was primary forest to a pellet plant owned by Drax.\nPrimary forests are natural forests that have not been significantly disturbed by human activity.\nFollowing the BBC investigation, Drax denied taking wood from primary forests but said it would not apply for further logging licences in the province.\nHowever, the company still takes whole logs from forests that have been cut down by timber companies.\nPanorama has obtained documents from British Columbia's Ministry of Forests that show the company took more than 40,000 tonnes of wood from so-called \"old-growth\" forests in 2023.\nOld-growth is some of the oldest forest which the provincial government says provides \"unique habitats, structures and ecological functions\".\nOne example is an 87-hectare (215-acre) \"cut block\" called EM807M - located 180 miles west of the logging city of Prince George - which was all classified as old growth. Although a timber company held the licence to cut down the site, logging records show that Drax took 26% of all the harvested wood.\nIn total, Drax received 130 lorry-loads of whole logs from the site last winter. The wood was turned into pellets and some were burned at its Yorkshire power plant.\nNinety per cent of the cut block had the even higher classification of \"priority deferral area\". This category is for old-growth forests that are \"rare, at risk and irreplaceable\", according to an independent panel of experts in British Columbia.\nThe experts recommended that logging should be paused in priority deferral areas, but it's still legal to cut them down. British Columbia's provincial government says it is working to ensure more old growth is deferred and protected.\nForests 'almost gone'\nDrax's use of timber from this \"irreplaceable\" forest was far from a one-off.\nForestry documents show that in the first nine months of last year the company took wood from 30 different timber marks in British Columbia where more than 25% of the forest had been designated as old growth. Twenty-six of those timber marks included the even rarer priority deferral areas.\nTimber marks - codes beaten on to wood by specially made hammers - identify all of the wood cut under individual logging licences on one or more parcels of land. The timber mark paper trail meant Panorama could track logs to Drax's pellet mills.\nIn total, Drax sourced about 55,000 cubic metres of whole logs - that's more than 1,100 large truck loads - from timber marks containing old-growth forest.\nEcologist Michelle Connolly, from the British Columbia campaign group Conservation North, says making pellets from old forests can never be sustainable.\n\"Old-growth forests in British Columbia are almost gone because of 70 years of logging to feed sawmills and pulp mills, and Drax is helping push our remaining ones off the cliff, along with our native biodiversity,\" she says.\nIn response to the latest findings by the BBC, Drax admitted it has taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.\nA spokesman for the company says that it keeps its sourcing policy and practices under regular review so that they \"take account of evolving forest dynamics, legislation, policy, and science\".\nDrax says that it decided in October 2023 to stop sourcing wood from old-growth priority deferral areas, and that \"work to implement this decision through the supply chain is ongoing\".\nThe company doesn't dispute that it is still taking wood from old-growth sites that are not priority deferral ar",
    "Scientists say they have solved the mystery of what lies at the heart of a celebrated cosmic explosion.\nIn February 1987, a star was seen exploding in a nearby galaxy. It was visible from Earth for months, shining with the power of 100 million suns.\nThere was so much debris, even the most powerful telescopes could not confirm what remained at its heart.\nNew results confirm it is a neutron star, so dense that a teaspoon of it would weigh 10 million tonnes.\nBBC Sky at Night presenter Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock said that the research team had \"solved a murder mystery\".\n\"It is about the death of a star and the mystery has been what lies in the shrouds of dust around what remains,\" she said.\nThe explosion was of a huge star, 20 times the mass of our Sun, a so-called blue supergiant. Its life ended in spectacular style in a process called a supernova, prosaically called SN 1987A, by astronomers. It was the first supernova to have been visible to the naked eye for 400 years, and was from a star whose details had been captured and recorded by astronomers before it exploded.\nDr Aderin-Pocock once worked on a project to solve the puzzle of SN 1987A, which she says was figuratively, as well as literally, a big star.\n\"The fact that it was visible gave it a celebrity status outside the world of science. And SN 1987A is also very close to the heart of astronomers because it was relatively close, and they were able to capture so much detail of the star's life cycle.\"\nThe observations made SN 1987A the ideal lab in the sky to check the details of the theories of how stars die. But there has been a critical piece of the puzzle missing - what was left at its heart after such a cataclysmic event.\nAccording to the theory, stars collapse when they run out of fuel to carry out the nuclear reactions that make them shine. The mass of the star is so great that its gravitational force crushes its own atoms to produce the densest material in the Universe, which is called a neutron star, or if it is a larger star, it can become a black hole.\nBut which one was it? This is important for astronomers to know, because supernovas spread the heavy elements that help to form and support life across the Universe.\nResearchers writing in the journal Science say they have strong if not overwhelming evidence that it is a neutron star.\nProf Claes Fransson, of Stockholm University in Sweden, who led the study, said this was the first time anyone had been able to probe the centre of the supernova and what was created there.\n\"We now know that there is a compact source of ionising radiation, most likely by a neutron star. We have been looking for this from the time of the explosion but had to wait to be able to verify the predictions.\"\nThe new data indicates that the surface of the neutron star would be about a million degrees, having cooled down from 100 billion degrees or so.\nBaby star\nThe team will continue to monitor the supernova area to learn more about the precise details of the explosion. And the data gives the team an opportunity to monitor a very early \"baby\" neutron star and compare it with older ones to see how these cosmic heavyweights evolve over time.\nThe observations were made possible because of Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). As well as being the most powerful space observatory ever built, it has instruments that take measurements at infra-red frequencies and so can see past the space dust that has for so long blocked our view.\nProf Mike Barlow, of UCL, says although there have been several indirect hints, JWST has obtained \"the first direct evidence'' that it is a neutron star.\n\"The mystery over whether a neutron star is hiding in the dust has lasted for more than 30 years and it is exciting that we have solved it.\"\nSmoking gun\nThe JWST data was analysed by 34 scientists from 12 countries. They found light from atoms of the elements, argon and sulphur that could have only been produced by powerful radiation coming from a neutron star at the centre of the supernova. There is no direct image of the neutron star itself, but it would be hard for anything else to explain the readings, according to Dr Robert Massey, of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n''If we're lucky then in the next few years we might even see the neutron star in the centre properly, getting a relatively close look at one of these intriguing objects very early in its life.\"\nSo although the astronomer detectives do not yet have the smoking gun, of the murder mystery, they do have the smoke from the gun.\nFollow Pallab on X",

    "An Israel-Gaza peace mural painted on a street in east London has been defaced 16 days after it was unveiled.\nIt was created by the charity Circle of Toys, which said it wanted to highlight \"the true victims of war\" - children.\nLocated on Old Street, Shoreditch it depicts two girls - one in a headscarf waving an Israeli flag and another waving a Palestinian flag.\nThe charity said the graffiti showed \"even more the importance of shifting the focus away from political debate\".\nThe painting was unveiled on 10 February.\nCircle of Toys began in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine with the goal of sending toys to children caught up in conflict.\nIt recently established a base in the Middle East and hopes to encourage people to donate toys to children in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\nThe graffiti reads 'Palestinian children killed since 07.09.23 11,500' and 'Funded by your taxes. Murder is murder'.\nThe spray paint alludes to 7 September 2023, which is likely to be a reference to 7 October 2023 when Hamas attacked Israel , which started the war.\nIsrael says more than 1,200 civilians were killed in the attack and more than 250 people were taken hostage .\nIn response, Israel conducted significant retaliatory attacks on Gaza, both on the ground and from the air.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry claims the death toll in Gaza now stands at more than 29,500 and continues to rise.\nIsrael has also forcefully displaced more than 85% of Gaza's population , sparking a humanitarian crisis in the region.\nTensions have flared in London since the conflict began.\nPrime Minister, Rishi Sunak has previously said he was \"proud\" to support Israel in its \"long war\" against Hamas, which he branded \"pure evil\".\nThere has also been a number of pro-Palestinian marches through London and last November, a war memorial was defaced with anti-Israel graffiti.\nHate crimes against both Muslim and Jewish communities have increased substantially across the capital in the aftermath of 7 October attack.\nFollowing news of the vandalism, the founder of Circle of Toys, Arthur Corvin Powells said \"this reaction shows even more the importance of shifting the focus away from the political debate and instead onto the future for the children\".\nThe charity added that the mural may be cleaned or re-painted and it was in talks with the mural artists to decide its next steps.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Oxford United has submitted a planning application for its proposed new stadium.\nThe application for the 16,000-capacity venue at The Triangle, near Kidlington, will be considered by Cherwell District Council.\nIt includes a 180-bed hotel, conference and event space, and a health and wellbeing centre.\nThe club recently announced its new ground would be the first all-electric stadium in the UK .\nPlans to incorporate the club's history also feature - including a modern interpretation of the arch from the club's old stadium, the Manor Ground, at the new ground's entrance.\nThe proposals were rejected in a 2023 Kidlington Parish Council poll , but this was not legally binding.\nThe five-hectare (12-acre) site is located south of Kidlington roundabout, west of Banbury Road, east of Frieze Way and opposite Oxford Parkway Station.\nThe club, which says it has to leave its current home at the Kassam Stadium when its lease expires in 2026, released computer generated pictures of the proposed complex in October.\nJon Clarke, development director at Oxford United, called the application a \"significant milestone\" for the \"future sustainability of the club\".\nHe added: \"We have taken the opportunity to create something truly incredible that not only places the visitor experience at its heart but is sustainable and will deliver huge benefits to our community and economy.\"\nThe club says the \"state-of-the-art\" stadium will not use any high carbon intensity fossil fuels, such as gas - with Mr Clarke calling it \"one of the greenest football stadiums to be built\".\nThe club also says it will be undertaking a planning application to build a bridge - thought to be from the stadium towards Oxford Parkway railway station - to further enhance connectivity.\nLast year Oxfordshire County Council agreed a deal in principle to lease the land to the club.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "Menopause symptoms can be considered a disability and employers face being sued if they do not make \"reasonable adjustments\", a watchdog has said.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) issued the guidance to clarify the legal obligations to workers going through the menopause.\nSymptoms can include hot flushes, brain fog and difficulty sleeping.\nThe EHRC said bosses should offer changes such as providing rest areas or flexible hours to help.\nRelaxing uniform policies to allow women to wear cooler clothes could also help.\nMenopause marks the end of a woman's menstrual cycle, and usually happens in her 40s or 50s.\nFailing to make \"reasonable adjustments\" amounts to disability discrimination under the Equality Act 2010 if the symptoms have a \"long-term and substantial impact\" on a woman's ability to carry out their usual day-to-day activities, the EHRC said.\nA video explaining the guidance says: \"The costs of failing to make workplace adjustments for staff can run into hundreds of thousands of pounds when taking into account the loss of talent and costs of defending a claim.\"\nThe EHRC cited research showing that one in 10 women surveyed who worked during their menopause were forced to leave their job due to the symptoms.\nTwo-thirds of women between the ages of 40 and 60 experienced menopausal symptoms at work, which largely had a negative impact. Very few asked for adjustments during this time because they were concerned about the potential reaction, it added.\nThe EHRC adds that taking disciplinary action against women for a menopause related-absence could amount to discrimination, and that language that ridicules someone's symptoms could constitute harassment.\nEHRC chairwoman Baroness Kishwer Falkner said the watchdog was \"concerned both by how many women report being forced out of a role due to their menopause-related symptoms, and how many don't feel safe enough to request the workplace adjustments\".\nShe added that employers \"may not fully understand their responsibility to protect their staff going through the menopause\", and that the new guidance had been issued to provide advice on how they can support their staff.\nWomen's health campaigner and author of Everything you need to know about the menopause (but were too afraid to ask) Kate Muir said the announcement was a \"side alley\" in the wider conversation around menopause.\n\"It's not a disability,\" she told the BBC's Today programme. \"It's something every woman goes through and legislation is not going to give you your missing hormones back.\"\nMs Muir said the main focus should be promoting \"menopause education\" to inform women about \"safer kinds of HRT which mean they don't need to have symptoms at all\".\nShe argued the NHS should give women a \"proper consultation\" when they go through menopause, as she said \"good HRT\" protects against cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis.\n\"Those are the messages we should be getting out to women so they can work, be powerful and go through this stage and be happy,\" she added.\nAre you a worker going through the menopause?

    "A ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court that frozen embryos are considered children, and that a person could be held liable for accidentally destroying them, has opened up a new front in the US battle over reproductive medicine.\nThe decision has thrown the future of IVF treatments in the state into doubt, with a host of healthcare providers in the state suspending the service.\nMedical experts and reproductive advocacy groups warned the ruling could have negative consequences for fertility treatments in Alabama and beyond.\nSome anti-abortion groups applauded the ruling, arguing that embryos deserve greater legal protections.\nWhy did this lawsuit occur and what did the court rule?\nThe case stems from a wrongful death lawsuit brought by three couples whose embryos were lost at a fertility clinic in 2020.\nA patient had wandered into the place where the embryos were stored, handled them, and accidentally dropped them. As a result, the embryos were destroyed.\nThe couples sought to sue the Center for Reproductive Medicine and the Mobile Infirmary Association under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. That law covers foetuses, but did not specifically cover embryos resulting from IVF.\nA lower court had ruled that the embryos did not qualify as a person or child, and that a wrongful death lawsuit could not move forward.\nBut in its ruling, the Alabama Supreme Court sided with the couples, and ruled that frozen embryos were considered \"children\" .\nThe wrongful death law applied to \"all unborn children, regardless of their location\", the decision said.\nConcurring with the majority opinion, Chief Justice Tom Parker wrote: \"Even before birth, all human beings have the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory.\"\nWhat are the implications for Alabama fertility patients?\nThe ruling does not ban or restrict IVF and in fact, the couples who brought the case actively sought out the procedure.\nBut the decision may cause confusion about whether some aspects of IVF are legal under Alabama law, experts say. If an embryo is considered a person, it could raise questions about how clinics are allowed to use and store them.\nElisabeth Smith, director of state policy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told the BBC in a statement: \"Not all [IVF] embryos are used, nor can they be.\n\"To enact legislation granting legal personhood to embryos could have disastrous consequences for the use of IVF - a science many people rely on to build their families.\"\nAmbiguity over the law could also extend to patients themselves, who may worry about whether the procedure remains available or legal.\nThe Medical Association of the State of Alabama said in a statement: \"The significance of this decision impacts all Alabamians and will likely lead to fewer babies - children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and cousins - as fertility options become limited for those who want to have a family.\"\nHow does this tie in with the US abortion debate?\nWhen the US Supreme Court struck down a nationwide right to abortion in 2022, it opened the door for states to make their own laws on the issue.\nSince the decision, Democratic-controlled states have expanded access while Republican-controlled states have restricted it.\nAlabama already has a total ban on abortion, at all stages of pregnancy.\nThe White House called the Alabama ruling \"exactly the type of chaos that we expected when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and paved the way for politicians to dictate some of the most personal decisions families can make\".\nAbortion opponents are also watching this ruling closely. The question of when an embryo or a foetus is legally considered a person is a factor in many state abortion restrictions.\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group, described the Alabama ruling as a \"tremendous victory for life\".\n\"No matter the circumstances, all human life is valuable from the moment of conception,\" spokeswoman Denise Burke said in a statement to the BBC. \"We are grateful the Court correctly found that Alabama law recognises this fundamental truth.\"\nOther anti-abortion activists said IVF was not as clear-cut an ethical issue in their eyes, compared to terminating a pregnancy.\nEric Johnston, a lawyer who helped draft Alabama's constitutional language on abortion in 2018, told the BBC: \"By and large the pro-life community would say that fertilised eggs are in need of protection.\"\nBut he acknowledged there were couples with anti-abortion views who had used IVF to have children, and said he would never condemn them.\n\"It's a dilemma, and a dilemma is something where you don't have a satisfactory answer,\" he added.\nWhat is IVF?\nInvitro fertilisation offers a possible solution where a woman faces challenges getting pregnant. Around 2% of US pregnancies are the result of IVF, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe process involves retrieving the woman's eggs with a needle from her ovaries ",
    "With a record-breaking seven nominations at this year's Brit Awards, Raye has put a full stop on one of pop's greatest comeback stories.\nThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.\nShe wrote for big names like Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.\nBut, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected.\nIn 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.\nNot knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.\nDozens of potential hits were \"sat in folders collecting dust\", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars \"because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough\".\n\"I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,\" she said. \"They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache.\n\"Because I'm about to make it a headache.\"\nThe decision to post that video \"wasn't at all planned\", she later told the BBC. \"It was more of a desperate cry to be free.\"\nPolydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was \"saddened\" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to \"offer our full support\".\nBehind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.\nEventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.\nPolydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed.\n\"People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',\" she told me last year .\nRaye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.\nThe singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity.\nBy the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award.\n\"It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,\" she has said of her success.\n\"It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you.\"\n'Full of hot air'\nSo how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.\nThen aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music.\n\"Keep out!\" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. \"I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock!\"\nDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.\nInside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle.\n\"This is my favourite place to be,\" she said. \"Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close.\"\nMusic and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.\nAfter the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano.\n\"I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'\"\nAged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.\nFour years later, she penned a \"proper\" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral.\nAt 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit.\n\"It's all cool, underground, indie artists,\" she said in 2016. \"I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing].'\"\nA smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean.\nAnd despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was ",

    "Postmasters and postmistresses in Devon have said they need more support from the Post Office in order to keep their businesses viable, and to continue serving their communities.\nSeveral in the county said the current remuneration package is not sufficient.\nSome have diversified to sell other products, or linked to other businesses in order to stay open.\nThe Post Office said its focus is on driving footfall and improving the profitability of all its branches.\nAccording to research from the House of Commons Library published on 7 February, about 99% of Post Office branches are run by franchise partners or sub-postmasters.\nAs part of a remuneration package, a fee is paid to postmasters for every Post Office transaction - such as selling stamps and travel money.\nWhile the Post Office said it could not provide details of the remuneration fees due to commercial reasons, the BBC understands these range from 3p to about \u00c2\u00a31.50 depending on the transaction.\n'I won't leave them in the lurch'\nTina Debenham, who has run Elburton's Post Office for 15 years, said running the business is hard due to how low some of the remuneration fees are.\nWhile she admitted it is difficult to make a living, Mrs Debenham - who also runs mobile Post Office services in areas including Rattery and Cornwood - said she was determined to keep running the shop in that area of Plymouth.\n\"You do it because you love the job and you do it because this community cannot afford to not have a Post Office and I won't leave them in the lurch,\" she said.\nColin Arthurs has run Bridestowe's Post Office inside a general shop in the west Devon village along with his wife Michaela since January 2018.\nHe said while Post Office bosses claim having a branch will help increase footfall, it is the takings from the shop that enable him to pay his bills.\nMr Arthurs said: \"We don't want to lose the Post Office, the village doesn't want to lose the Post Office, but you have to make it financially viable.\"\nIn Moretonhampstead, the Post Office is run by Sue Boulton, who also owns the Baskerville ice cream parlour and coffee shop in the Dartmoor town.\nShe and her partner Colin Lloyd bought the building in 2022, a couple of years after the Post Office had closed down there.\nMs Boulton said it was important for the town to have its Post Office back, but without the ice cream parlour, it would not be sustainable.\n\"It doesn't pay for itself if we were opening just as a Post Office,\" Ms Boulton, who uses a room in the building to help store and make ice cream, said.\n'Important social value'\nA Post Office spokesperson said the current financial climate was \"challenging\" and they understood postmasters have been dealing with cost rises.\nThey added the Post Office is committed to increasing the share of income going to postmasters, with a recent review announcing a package of \u00c2\u00a326m in remuneration improvements for this financial year.\n\"Our focus has been and continues to be on driving footfall to our branches and improving branch profitability,\" the spokesperson said.\nThey added: \"In particularly rural and remote areas, there is insufficient footfall for a post office branch to be viable on its own, however, it nevertheless delivers important social value to the local community.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

    "US Supreme Court justices appeared torn on Monday as they heard a landmark pair of cases which could fundamentally alter the future of online free speech.\nAt issue were Republican-backed laws passed in Florida and Texas limiting tech firms' ability to remove political content they deem objectionable.\nTech giants said the laws, passed after the 2021 Capitol riot, infringed on their right to editorial discretion.\nAt times justices seemed unsure of how to apply existing law to tech firms.\nIndustry groups have argued that the laws passed in Florida and Texas violated the right to free speech, which included the freedom of private companies to decide what content to publish on their platforms.\nSupporters of the laws say they protect the First Amendment rights of conservative users from censorship by what they imply are left-leaning tech companies.\nThe First Amendment to the US Constitution protects the freedom of speech and expression of American citizens from being censored by the government.\nOn Monday, the back-and-forth between the justices and attorneys often centred around comparisons, in particular whether social media firms like YouTube and Facebook were more akin to newspapers or telephone companies.\nJustice Alito, a conservative member of the court, voiced concern as to whether editorial protections afforded to newspapers were applicable to social media giants. At one point the 73-year-old quipped \"if YouTube were a newspaper, how much would it weigh\".\nHenry Whitaker, Florida's solicitor general, laid out the conservative argument for the court, claiming that tech giants applied censorship policies \"in an inconsistent manner\" to \"deplatform\" certain users.\n\"They contend that they possess a broad First Amendment right to censor anything they host on their sites, even when doing so contradicts their own representations to consumers,\" Mr Whitaker said. \"But the design of the First Amendment is to prevent the suppression of speech, not to enable it.\"\nFormer President Donald Trump, who was removed from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the wake of his inflammatory comments during the Capitol riot, filed in support of the state laws. He argued that tech firms' \"decision to discriminate against a user\" is not protected under the Constitution.\nBut a trade group representing the tech giants, and supported by the Biden administration, told the court on Monday that the laws would infringe on their own First Amendment rights by effectively barring them from removing content or accounts which they do not want on their sites - or which would usually be removed under content policies.\nPaul Clement, a lawyer presenting the cases on behalf of NetChoice, cited previous Supreme Court rulings that held that private organisers could not be forced to carry messages they did not agree with.\nHe also suggested that if companies were prevented from moderating content they could be forced to carry all sorts of objectionable content, including antisemitic and pro-suicide posts.\nBrett Kavanaugh, a conservative justice appointed by Mr Trump, challenged Mr Whitaker to reconcile the Florida law with prior Supreme Court rulings that \"emphasise editorial control as being fundamentally protected by the First Amendment\".\nJustices seemed sceptical of the sprawling nature of the laws, which they said may be unconstitutional where applied to a Facebook post, but may be permitted when protecting communications on other non-expressive apps, such as the provision of email services.\nJustice Alito and Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, both raised the possibility of returning the case to a lower court to further develop who exactly is covered by the Florida bill in particular.\nUS Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, speaking in support of the tech lobby's case, urged the court to rule narrowly on what she called a \"defect\" in the Texas law, rather than issuing broad findings on how the first amendment interacts with social media.\nConservatives in the US have long assailed tech giants over their moderation policies, which they say is unfairly biased towards left-wing views.\nWhen signing the Texas bill into law, Gov Greg Abbott said: \"It is now law that conservative viewpoints in Texas cannot be banned on social media.\"",
    "Donald Trump's legal team says mobile phone data suggest two prosecutors investigating him did not tell the truth about their relationship.\nThe former president is trying to get Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis disqualified from the case.\nHis lawyers say phone records indicate Ms Willis misrepresented the timeline of her affair with another prosecutor.\nThe district attorney's office denied the allegations and said the data was being misinterpreted.\nMr Trump and co-defendants are accused of attempting to interfere with the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\nBut they are arguing that Ms Willis' relationship with Nathan Wade, a prosecutor she hired to the case, amounted to a financial conflict of interest.\nIn a hearing earlier this month, both Ms Willis and Mr Wade testified that their affair did not begin until early 2022, only after Mr Wade was appointed.\nBut in a legal filing on Friday, Charles Mittelstadt, an investigator for Mr Trump's legal team, said phone records suggest that Mr Wade, who was married at the time, was in the vicinity of Ms Willis' home for \"an extended period\" at least 35 times throughout 2021.\n\"The data reveals he is stationary and not in transit,\" the affidavit states, citing geolocation activity for Mr Wade's device.\nMr Mittelstadt also said the couple had exchanged more than 2,000 calls and nearly 12,000 phone interactions, such as voice calls and text messages, over 11 months in 2021.\nThe investigator said the data suggested that on two occasions Mr Wade was in proximity to Ms Willis' apartment from late at night until before dawn.\nIn one instance, Mr Mittelstadt says phone records show Mr Wade's device was pinged around Ms Willis' condominium at 22:45 one night in September 2021, and remained there until about 03:30 in the morning.\nThe investigator said Mr Wade's phone sent a text at 04:20 that morning to Ms Willis after returning to the area of his own home.\nBut in court documents filed late on Friday, Ms Wills' office said that the phone data \"do not prove anything relevant\" and should not be entered into court as evidence.\n\"The records do nothing more than demonstrate that Special Prosecutor Wade's telephone was located somewhere within a densely populated multiple-mile radius where various residences, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and other businesses are located,\" the filing said.\nIt also said the phone records do nothing to prove any romantic relationship existed in 2021 between Ms Willis and Mr Wade, or that they were \"ever at the same place during any of the times listed\".\nOn Friday, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee said a hearing on the disqualification matter would be held on 1 March.\nMr Trump's legal team alleges that Ms Willis financially benefited from the affair and should be removed from the case.\nThe two prosecutors have denied their relationship created a conflict of interest, or that their trips and meals together amounted to any improper financial benefit.\nEven if Ms Willis does get disqualified from the case, it would not necessarily spell the end of the criminal charges against Mr Trump.\nBut it would delay proceedings, possibly until after November's presidential election.\nIn the Georgia election case, Mr Trump is accused of fraudulently conspiring to erase a deficit of fewer than 12,000 votes in the state, which he lost to Joe Biden.\nIn total, the Republican White House frontrunner is facing 91 criminal charges in four separate cases.\nSeparately on Friday, a judge in New York ordered the ex-president to pay $454m (\u00c2\u00a3358m) within one month, after he was found liable for fraud in a civil case relating to inflated valuations for his business assets.\nMore on the US election",

    "A university student from Florida has made a habit of getting under the skin of some of the world's richest and most powerful people. How? By telling the rest of us where their private planes are - and how much carbon they emit.\nJack Sweeney would like to clarify a few details. For one thing, he thinks Taylor Swift has some good tunes.\nHowever, he believes - despite the threat of legal action - that anybody should be able to see where her private jet is headed, and how often it flies.\n\"I like to be fair,\" he told the BBC in an email. \"I try to share everyone's info no matter who it is.\"\nBut it is specifically information about the locations of private planes of the rich and powerful - posted to his social media accounts - that has repeatedly made the 21-year-old the subject of news stories and legal threats.\nOn Monday, Mr Sweeney posted a photo of his lawyer's response to Ms Swift's demand that he take down his  @TaylorSwiftJets account, which tracks the singer's flights.\nThe letter, which was dated last month, argued that the jet-tracking account \"is engaged in protected speech that does not violate any of Ms. Swift's legal rights\".\nThe photo was captioned with a Swiftian reference: \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nMr Sweeney is the son of an airline maintenance operations controller and a teacher, and grew up in the suburbs of Orlando. He says he has always had an interest in aviation and technology, and particularly in Elon Musk's SpaceX and Tesla companies.\nThose interests gradually led him to develop a plane tracking website, TheAirTraffic.com, and social media accounts which track the aircraft of celebrities, politicians, tycoons and Russian oligarchs.\nThe system relies on publicly available data collected by amateur enthusiasts. Aeroplanes in the sky regularly send out information about where they are located, and these signals can be picked up by people using inexpensive receivers on the ground.\nThis thriving cohort of online plane trackers is part of the larger Osint (open-source intelligence) community, populated by people who delve into masses of freely available online data looking for incriminating, insightful or just plain interesting nuggets of information. It is a motley crew that includes a range of individuals - from the mildly curious to dedicated researchers and committed investigative journalists.\n\"Originally I was just kind of doing this as a hobby as I found it interesting,\" said Mr Sweeney, who is currently in his third year of an information technology degree at the University of Central Florida.\nAs time has gone by, he has found a more defined purpose. He says he believes \"in the importance of transparency and public information\".\nAnd there is an environmental angle: \"The flyers are trying to hide the bad PR of [carbon] emissions.\"\nHis data has been used in studies showing the huge carbon footprint of Ms Swift and her entourage, and he criticised the singer in another post on X, sharing a clip of her telling her boyfriend Travis Kelce: \"Jet lag is a choice\".\n\"Jet lag is a choice for those who fly in private jets and sleep in queen size beds onboard,\" he wrote.\nThe singer says she has bought enough carbon offsets to cancel out emissions from her latest tour twice over.\nBut there are also privacy issues at stake. Ms Swift contends that revealing the location of her private plane puts her at risk from stalkers.\nIn a letter first revealed by the Washington Post, lawyers for the singer wrote that plane tracking was a \"life-or-death matter\" and there was \"no legitimate interest in or public need for this information, other than to stalk, harass, and exert dominion and control\".\nMr Sweeney rejects those assertions and says there is a fundamental public interest in locating the pop star's plane. His proof? Swifties themselves.\n\"Her fans, who have grown the TaylorSwiftJets accounts and subreddit, are the ones truly interested,\" he says. \"These tracking accounts consistently have more supporters and fans [than detractors].\"\nAnd given world tours and numerous public appearances - including at marquee NFL games - it is usually fairly easy to figure out where Ms Swift will be at some point in the future.\nPrior to the Super Bowl, for instance, numerous stories were published speculating about her travel schedule between a gig in Tokyo and the big game in Las Vegas.\nMuch of this public information is more granular than the location of a plane. Flight data can show who owns an aircraft and where it is in the sky, but not who is on it, or where those people travel to after the plane lands.\nBut Ms Swift's representatives say the plane information gives exact times and locations of her movements, and notes that one alleged stalker was recently arrested outside her New York home. Her publicist Tree Paine said in a statement: \"His posts tell you exactly when and where she would be.\"\nMr Sweeney also had some advice for the star - gently suggesting that if privacy is her top concern, she could register her pr",

    "At least five people have died and up to 15 are missing after a massive fire ripped through two joined apartment blocks in the Spanish city of Valencia, emergency services say.\nThe blaze engulfed a 14-storey block in the Campanar neighbourhood and spread to an adjoining building.\nFirefighters were seen rescuing people from balconies.\nExperts say that highly flammable cladding on the building enabled the fire to spread rapidly.\nThe building contains 138 flats and was home to 450 residents, newspaper El Pais reported, citing the building's manager.\nFifteen people, including six firefighters and a young child, have been injured although their lives are not in danger.\nValencia Mayor Mar\u00c3\u00ada Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Catal\u00c3\u00a1 said authorities were still trying to locate between nine and 15 people, while the government's regional representative said 14 people remained unaccounted for.\nMore than 20 fire crews tackled the blaze, which was made worse by high winds. By early Friday the block was a giant fire-blackened shell. People were urged to stay away from the area.\nLocal reports said firefighters had rescued several residents using cranes, including a couple living on the seventh floor.\nOne woman told TVE she had seen firefighters attempting to rescue a teenage boy trapped on the building's first floor.\nLuis Ibanez, who lives nearby, told TVE he had looked out of a window and saw the flames engulfing the block \"within a matter of minutes\", saying it was \"as if it was made of cork\".\n\"I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The whole side of the building directly opposite was on fire.\"\nOne man who lives on the second floor of the building told TV channel La Sexta that the flames grew rapidly after the fire started, reportedly on the fourth floor.\n\"The fire spread in a matter of 10 minutes,\" he said, adding that material on the facade of the building may have caused the fire to spread.\nQuestions have been asked in Spain about the materials used in construction of the building, which was built in 2008-09.\nEsther Puchades, vice president of the College of Industrial Technical Engineers of Valencia, told Spanish news agency Efe she had previously inspected the building.\nShe said its exterior featured a polyurethane material, which is no longer in wide use because of fears over flammability. It also has an aluminium covering.\n\"The reason the [building] burned so fast is because of this type of cladding,\" she told Spanish media.\nThe cladding has been described by experts as effective for heat insulation but the ventilation, or gap, between it and the covering means it can be highly flammable.\nLuis Sendra, of Valencia's architects' association, said this can cause a \"chimney effect\", allowing fires to spread more quickly.\nThe issue of cladding recalls the 2017 tragedy at London's Grenfell Tower. The cladding was blamed for helping flames to spread when that fire broke, resulting in 72 deaths.\nFirefighters were called at around 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). A field hospital has been set up in the area, RTVE reported. People displaced from their homes would be housed in hotels, authorities said.\nWriting on X (formerly known as Twitter) Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: \"Dismayed by the terrible fire in a building in Valencia... I want to convey my solidarity to all the people affected and recognition to all the emergency personnel already deployed at the scene.\"\nThe Valencia authorities have announced a day of official mourning for the victims of the fire.\nAre you in the area?

Most of the book's pages remained uncut, said a spokesperson for English Heritage, which runs Darwin's home at Downe, near Orpington.\nBefore industrial printing became a common practice in mid-20th Century book-binding, a book's pages were often joined by a fold at the top of the page and, in order to read the book, the fold had to be sliced.\nDr Tessa Kilgarriff, curator of collections and interiors at English Heritage, said: \"The uncut pages, and lack of customary pencil marks, suggest Darwin was less enamoured with Marx's writing - or, quite possibly, that his German simply wasn't up to scratch.\"\nDarwin's son, the late Francis Darwin, agreed that his dad struggled with the German language.\nHe noticed his father's German books contained fewer scribbled notes, ideas, and annotations. \"He would say that his only way was to read a sentence a great many times over, and at last the meaning occurred to him,\" he once said.\nHowever, while thanking Marx for the gift, Darwin suggested his lack of political understanding could have been the reason for the book's unread condition: \"I heartily wish that I was more worthy to receive it, by understanding more of the deep and important subject of political economy.\"\nThe book was last on show in 2017, before being removed from display when curators noticed it was deteriorating.\nCambridge University Library restored the book, repairing small tears on the cover and fixing the deteriorating spine by applying tissue and an adhesive.\nDr Kilgarriff added: \"We are pleased that this fragile volume has now been preserved and many more people will have the chance to enjoy it for years to come.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X , formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram .

    "Republicans in Alabama will introduce a bill designed to protect access to IVF treatment, after a court ruling cast doubt on its availability.\nThe state's top court ruled earlier this month that frozen embryos have the same rights as children and people can be held liable for destroying them.\nWhile it did not ban or restrict IVF, it created a legal headache for clinics and some pulled their services.\nThe bill is expected to be introduced in the Alabama Senate on Tuesday.\nRepublicans hold a majority in the chamber and Senator Tim Melson, who is putting forward the bill, said he was confident \"reasonable minds\" would come together to pass it.\nMr Melson, who is also a doctor, told the BBC that the issue became his priority after \"a lot of people came into my office in Montgomery and explained that this is the only option they have for a family and it's in jeopardy\".\n\"We need to make sure that clinics are not put in jeopardy for manslaughter, or some criminal homicide or negligent homicide when an unused embryo is discarded,\" he said. \"I think we need to make it clear that when embryos are discarded, it was because it was not the optimal embryo to use.\"\nAlabama's attorney general earlier said he had no intention of prosecuting clinics, but many are still waiting for legal clarity.\nMr Melson expects the bill to progress quickly. \"It'll get introduced on Tuesday, be in a committee on Wednesday and then on the special order calendar on Thursday,\" he said.\nThe whole process should take two to three weeks, he said, before the bill is eventually signed into law by the governor.\nA separate bill was put forward by Democrats in the Alabama House shortly after the ruling on 16 February.\nThat bill states that any fertilised embryo outside a uterus is not an unborn child. House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, who introduced the bill, told the BBC it \"essentially pauses the Supreme Court decision\" and makes it law that \"a fertilised embryo cannot be considered a child\".\n\"Alabama is ground zero,\" he said. \"Those other countries and other places that consider themselves to be extremely conservative could follow suit. And so we must address this head on.\"\nHis office told the BBC that it received more than 600 emails related to IVF in the 48 hours after he introduced the bill.\nMr Daniels said he \"sees an opportunity for Democrats to have a seat at the table in addressing this issue\". That's often not the case, with Democrats outnumbered in the Alabama by a significant margin.\n\"If we don't have a seat at the table, then we're going to be very vocal,\" he said.\nBut given the Republican supermajority in Alabama's legislature, Mr Melson's bill is much more likely to pass than Mr Daniels'.\nThe Republican bill is not likely to fully oppose the Supreme Court ruling, in order to avoid alienating conservatives who believe an embryo is a human life regardless of its location. But crucially it has to also satisfy those who disagree with the ruling and its implications.\n\"I know my bill works,\" Mr Melson said. \"I'll be glad to listen to the House bill. But I know mine works. And that's after talking with some of the greatest minds in Montgomery.\"\nAmong those minds are legislative experts, lawyers and physicians.\nOne of the doctors is Beth Malizia, the co-founder of Alabama Fertility Specialists which has put new IVF treatments on hold.\n\"I've spoken with Senators,\" she said. \"I've spoken with many, many people in that area to offer our support and whatever we can do to help them to move this process along. So, I'm feeling cautiously optimistic.\"\nMeanwhile, Eric Johnston, the president of the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition, told the BBC he has been speaking to lawmakers about finding a legislative solution.\n\"If we can have an agreement between the pro-life community and the medical community, then the bill will be introduced in the legislature,\" he said. \"It will go through the processes very quickly and can be done within two weeks once we come to an agreement.\"\nThere are broader political considerations in passing legislation too, especially for Republicans.\nThe court decision in Alabama risks setting up a political backlash heading into the November presidential election. It threatens to undermine the party's attempts to court suburban women and independent voters, especially those who are already uncomfortable with abortion restrictions.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have said the ruling is a major reason for voters to come out in support of them. They believe the reproductive rights debate includes increasing concerns over access to medication, care and now IVF treatment.\nFormer President Donald Trump, the clear front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination, called on Alabama lawmakers to preserve access to the treatment. Has that pressure impacted Republicans? Mr Melson is emphatic it has not.\n\"No. No... President Biden came out, Nikki Haley commented. And if they thought we should go the opposite way, I'm still going to do what I think is",
    "Wales' farming minister says \"changes will be made\" to the post-Brexit agriculture policy following protests.\nLesley Griffiths said the Welsh government accepted changes were needed, but she wanted to hear \"all the responses\" to the consultation first.\nProtesters are unhappy with proposed subsidy changes, which require 10% of agricultural land to be used for trees.\nNFU Cymru said Ms Griffiths's comments alone would not be enough to reassure farmers.\nMs Griffiths conceded the \"majority of people\" were unhappy with the proposals but said she did not want to pre-empt the consultation into the policy, the Sustainable Farming Scheme, which ends on 7 March.\n\"Officials are already saying to me, 'there will have to be changes made' but I want to look at it holistically,\" she told BBC Politics Wales .\n\"We need all those responses. We need all the feedback and we need to look at what can be done,\" she said.\nMs Griffiths added the \"whole point\" of the \"seven-year conversation\" the government has had with farmers was to ensure sustainable food production and to help fight climate change.\nAbi Reader, deputy president of farming union NFU Cymru, told the programme: \"We are yet to see any reassurance from Welsh government that anything is going to change.\n\"We are desperate to see some reassurances from Welsh government that they are listening and they will change things because at the moment there is a huge swell of anger out there, which is headed for the Senedd.\"\nMs Reader said no progress was made at a meeting between unions and Welsh government ministers last week, which she described as \"so disappointing\".\nUnions wanted reassurances of regular meetings with ministers \"to continue dialogue\" and the appointment of a \"scientific advisory panel\" in order to explore alternatives to planting trees.\nShe said: \"Its making sure that we put stability back into farming businesses. That is what farmers want to see an overall.\n\"We need a model that is universal. It's universal for every single farmer in Wales to access.\"\nPlaid Cymru Senedd member Llyr Gruffydd told the programme there needed to be \"a much stronger signal from government that it isn't just going to plough on with these proposals.\"\nHe added the 10% tree cover policy needed reviewing, calling it an \"arbitrary figure\".\n\"That one size fits all approach does not suit all farms, we need to be much more creative and much more flexible,\" he said.\nEarlier this week, First Minister Mark Drakeford angered farmers by saying it was not up to farmers how subsidies were spent and blaming those who voted for Brexit for the changes to subsidies.\nMs Reader labelled the comments \"very inflammatory\" and argued farmers were the \"best placed people to help guide the process\".\nAndrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader, called the first minister's rhetoric \"absolutely scandalous\".\n\"Pitting people against each other on such a basis is something that the First Minister needs to reflect on,\" he said.",
    "Australian police are investigating an allegation by a paparazzo that he was assaulted by Taylor Swift's father.\nBen McDonald, 51, accused Scott Swift, 71, of striking his face on a Sydney wharf. He did not need medical help.\nThe confrontation happened on Tuesday after Mr Swift and the pop megastar disembarked from a yacht.\nA spokesperson for the singer did not address the assault claim but said two people had behaved aggressively towards them.\nA video published by Australian media shows the singer, who is concealed beneath an umbrella, walking with her father and security guards along Neutral Bay Wharf about 02:30 local time (15:30 GMT Monday).\nCameras flash before two voices - reported to be a photographer and a guard - accuse each other of touching umbrellas.

    "The chancellor is considering a cut in National Insurance, rather than income tax in the Budget, the BBC understands.\nJeremy Hunt is expected to make final decisions on his 6 March Budget plans at the end of this week.\nA leading think tank has warned the government should not cut taxes in the upcoming Budget, unless it can spell out how it will afford them.\nThe government said it would not comment on whether further cuts to tax would be \"affordable in the Budget\".\nAt last year's Autumn Statement, Mr Hunt announced a bigger-than-expected cut in National Insurance, taking the main rate down from 12% to 10% from the start of this year.\nThe government's independent financial watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said at the time this cut would help create 28,000 more jobs.\nA further cut to National Insurance of 1% would cost \u00c2\u00a34.5bn per year.\nAs first reported in the Times , Mr Hunt is understood to be aiming for a similar approach this time, making what he calls \"smart tax cuts\" aimed at improving the economy.\nBoth Mr Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have made no secret of wanting to reduce the taxation burden on the general public. Last month, the chancellor hinted that he was looking at trimming public spending as a way to deliver tax cuts.\nHowever, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said on Tuesday that the case for tax cuts was \"weak\", and the chancellor should not go ahead with them without providing specific details of where the axe would fall.\nAny tax cuts \"should wait\" until the chancellor was able to do a detailed spending review, the think tank said.\n\"We don't think we should be implementing certain tax cuts now, essentially that are paid for by uncertain spending cuts that might never be delivered,\" IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said.\nThe IFS said taxes in the UK were heading to record-high levels when measured against the size of the overall economy. However, government debt was also high and rising, and \"barely on course\" to be falling in five years' time - one of the government's self-imposed rules.\nMoreover, even this \"unhappy outlook\" for the public finances was based on spending cuts and tax rises, including a rise in fuel duties and changes to business rates that were \"unlikely to be realised\" the IFS said.\n\"There is therefore only a weak economic case for another sizeable net tax cut in the forthcoming Budget,\" the IFS wrote in its report published on Tuesday.\nThe IFS said if Mr Hunt did want to go ahead with tax cuts, he should look at reforming stamp duty on purchasing properties or shares, rather than reducing income tax or a further cut to National Insurance rates, which were reduced in January.\nMr Emmerson conceded that tax cuts can help to boost growth in the economy, but said: \"That doesn't mean the tax cuts will pay for themselves.\n\"There's lots of problems in our tax system - we need genuine tax reform - and if we want growth-friendly tax cuts we should be looking at stamp duty on purchases of properties and stamp duty on purchases of shares,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.\n\"They're very damaging taxes and cutting them would be better for growth than, for example, cutting the main rate of national insurance.\"\nThe government i s also considering announcing a new tax on vapes at the Budget next week.\nCurrently, vaping products are subject to VAT - but unlike tobacco, they are not also subject to a dedicated levy.\nTobacco duty could also be increased to make sure vaping remains cheaper.\nTop-up needed\nThe budgets for the NHS, schools, defence and overseas aid are ringfenced, however the IFS said unprotected areas such as justice and local government would see bigger squeezes as a result.\nLocal councils are already struggling with their own debts after years of shrinking budgets. Several have effectively gone bust , including Birmingham City Council, Nottingham, Thurrock and Woking.\nThe IFS said its calculations suggested that in order to keep real-terms spending per person at current levels for those unprotected services alongside \"plausible\" settlements for the NHS, childcare and other commitments, the chancellor would need to find a further \u00c2\u00a325bn.\nThe suggestion of tax cuts has drawn criticism from other quarters. Last month the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) described the government's \"pencilled-in\" post-election spending plans as a \"work of fiction\".\nMeanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also advised the UK against further tax cuts , in its latest assessment of the world economy.\nBut there is extra political pressure on the decisions the chancellor will make next month. This Budget could be his last chance to announce big policy changes before a general election which must be held by January next year.\nThe government is set to borrow \u00c2\u00a3113bn this year, \u00c2\u00a311bn less than was forecast in November, the IFS calculated, but still twice what it was borrowing prior to the pandemic.\nThe IFS warned that any extra \"headroom\" in the Budget, was",
    "People in their early 20s are more likely to be not working due to ill health than those in their early 40s, a report has found.\nThis is \"radically different\" from the past, the Resolution Foundation said, when the older you were the more likely you were to not work due to sickness.\nPoor mental health among young people is on the rise, official figures show.\nThis can hamper their education and lead to them being in lower-paid jobs or unemployed, the report said .\nOne in 20 young people (5%) were economically inactive due to ill health in 2023, it said.\nAccording to the report, young people now have the poorest mental health of any age group - a reversal from two decades ago when they had the lowest incidence of common mental disorders.\nIn 2021/22, 34% of young people aged 18 to 24 reported symptoms of a mental disorder, such as depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder.\nIn 2000, that figure stood at 24%.\nAs a result, more than half a million 18 to 24 year olds were prescribed anti-depressants in 2021-22.\nLouise Murphy, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said attention had more often been on mental health in higher education, but \"what should most worry us is when poor mental health comes together with poor education outcomes\".\n\"The economic consequences of poor mental health are starkest for young people who don't go to university, with one in three young non-graduates with a common mental disorder currently workless,\" she said.\nThe study found that young women fare worse, and are one-and-a-half times more likely to experience poor mental health as young men (41% compared with 26%).\nThe research also found that 79% of 18 to 24 year olds who are \"workless\" due to ill health only have qualifications at GCSE level or below.\nThis compares with 34% of all people in that age group.\nIf children aged 11 to 14 suffer poor mental health they are three times more likely not to pass five GCSEs including English and Maths compared with healthy children, the report said.\nOff the back of the study, the Resolution Foundation, which campaigns for better living standards for those on low and middle incomes, is calling for better mental health support in colleges and sixth forms, and for more to be done to make it so that less young people leave compulsory education with low qualification levels.\nThe research has been produced by the Resolution Foundation, but is funded by the Health Foundation - a charity which says it aims to bring about better health and care.\nThe director of the Health Foundation, Jo Bibby, said that the \"building blocks of health\" are things like \"good employment and education\" and \"cross-government action\" was needed to stop the creation of a \"lost generation\" due to poor mental health.\nGary Siva, from Portsmouth, runs online mental wellbeing platform Zumos, which is used by many schools and aims to teach young people resilience and mindfulness skills early in life.\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live there is a mental health \"crisis\" in the UK and a lack of funding is only making the situation worse, with a \"coordinated approach\" needed to tackle the \"spiral\" in mental wellbeing.\nMr Siva said social media has been a factor in making the need to help younger people with their mental health more urgent.\nChildren look to their friends on social media for validation, as opposed to themselves or even their families, he said, while problems that would previously have stopped at the school gates, such as bullying, do not now.\nMany of the study's findings are based on the Labour Force Survey, which has recently been stopped by the Office for National Statistics because the numbers taking part had fallen.\nHowever, the Health Foundation has previously said it believes the data is still accurate enough for its analysis.",

    "The Scottish government's budget has passed its final vote at Holyrood.\nFinance Secretary Shona Robison said her \u00c2\u00a359.7bn spending plans would protect frontline services and include funding for a council tax freeze.\nExtra revenue will be raised by new 45% and 48% income tax rates for higher earners, which were voted on last week.\nBut opposition parties warned the measures could harm economic growth and they criticised cuts for affordable housing.\nThe budget was passed by 68 votes to 55 with one abstention.\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf made the surprise promise of a year-long council tax freeze to help those struggling with the cost of living crisis when he addressed the SNP conference last October.\nScotland's 32 local authorities have been offered \u00c2\u00a3147m as compensation, with an extra \u00c2\u00a362.7m also announced for those that freeze council tax. Ministers claim the freeze is \"fully-funded\".\nHowever, a failure to consult with council leaders before the announcement led to a dispute over funding between the Scottish government and local government body Cosla which says not enough money is being provided to cover the policy.\nArgyll and Bute Council's Conservative, Lib Dem and independent coalition was the first to defy SNP ministers when it voted for a 10% rise last week - although other councils have so far stuck to the freeze.\nOn Monday, Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland News he was hoping to persuade Argyll and Bute to reconsider .\nThe tax plans includes a new \"advanced rate\" tax band of 45% for those earning between \u00c2\u00a375,000 and \u00c2\u00a3125,140\nThe top rate of tax, paid by those earning more than \u00c2\u00a3125,000, will also rise from 47% to 48%.\nIt means Scotland will have six income tax bands from April, while England and Wales have three. Anyone earning over \u00c2\u00a328,500 will pay more in tax than they would if living south of the border, according to the Scottish Fiscal Commission.\nMs Robison told MSPs: \"We are choosing to make our income tax system more progressive in order to help fund our vital frontline services.\"\nShe said Scotland's different tax rates would raise an extra \u00c2\u00a31.5bn, and she challenged anyone who preferred the UK tax rates and bands to \"say where your hammer blow of \u00c2\u00a31.5bn of cuts would fall\".\nOther measures include an increase the Scottish Child Payment from \u00c2\u00a325 to \u00c2\u00a326.70 from April and \u00c2\u00a31.5m for local authorities to cancel school meal debt.\nFunding for NHS boards will rise by \u00c2\u00a3550m - or 4.3% - and amounts to \u00c2\u00a313.2bn which the government claims is an \"above real terms\" rise but capital spending on infrastructure such as new health centres is in doubt.\nPolicing is allocated \u00c2\u00a31.5bn including funding for body-worn cameras.\n'Chaotic and incompetent\"\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the budget was a \"desperate attempt\" to plug the hole in Scotland's finances.\nFinance spokeswoman Liz Smith said the the choices exposed a fundamental divide in Scottish politics.\nShe said the divide was \"between those of us who believe that the policy is to stimulate jobs, investment and economic growth and encourage aspirations to be the top priority\" and those who favour the \"so-called social contract\" between the government and the public.\nShe said many leading business figures and groups were warning that tax divergence between Scotland and the rest of the UK was moving \"beyond the tipping point\" and would affect the economy.\nScottish Labour's finance spokesman Michael Marra described it as a  \"chaotic and incompetent\" budget.\n\"It is not a budget for growth, it is not a budget for public services and it is not a budget that fights poverty,\" he said.\n\"It is a budget based on the economically and fiscally illiterate assumption that income tax can be left to plug the hole left by the SNP's failure to grow the economy.\"\nHe said the Institute of Fiscal Studies had described the government's presentation of its local government funding as \"seriously misleading\" and had \"called out\" its \"spin\" about investment in the NHS which he said faced a real terms cut.\nThe Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton the budget showed ministers were \"completely out of ideas\" on how to drive growth and innovation.\nDuring the Holyrood debate, the finance secretary addressed the nearly \u00c2\u00a3200m in cuts to the affordable housing budget, a reduction of about 26%.\nMs Robison said they had been forced on her by funding cuts from Westminster, but she said the Scottish government still had a target to deliver 110,000 affordable homes by 2032.\nShe also promised that affordable housing would be a priority if more money becomes available for capital spending as a result of the chancellor's spring budget.\nCosla resources spokesperson Katie Hagmann said it was \"not a good budget for Scottish local government\", and councils were left with uncertainty over promises of potentially more funding which are dependent on UK government spending decisions.",

    "A public consultation has begun after a new application was submitted for a controversial waste incinerator.\nCalder Valley Skip Hire has applied to Calderdale Council for an environmental permit to operate a plant on Rochdale Road in Sowerby Bridge.\nThe council refused a previous plan in 2017, with a subsequent appeal dismissed by the government in 2023.\nIf granted, Calder Valley Skip Hire said it would burn up to 10,000 tonnes of waste a year at the site.\nDocuments from the skip removal company show the incinerator would be used to burn waste that can not be recycled from a transfer station at the same site.\nPlanning permission has already been granted for the small waste incinerator, but an environmental permit is also needed for it to operate.\nCampaigners against the plant have argued granting the permit would have an adverse affect on air quality and their health.\nWhen Calderdale Council previously refused planning permission in 2017, the decision was later overturned on appeal to the planning inspectorate, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service .\nAn environmental permit was also granted at the time, but then quashed after objectors sought a judicial review over the council's decision making.\nAs a result the status of the permit application was deemed to be \"undetermined\" prompting the company's appeal, which the planning inspectorate determined by dismissing it.\nJenny Lynn, cabinet member for public services and communities, said: \"We invite local people to share their views on the new Environmental Permit request from Calder Valley Skip Hire.\n\"The Council will consider the application at the end of the consultation period, taking all comments on board, with the support of an external specialist for an independent view.\"\nThe 35-day public consultation runs until Monday 1 April.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "A coroner has raised concerns about the mental health of offenders serving indefinite sentences after a man died.\nMatthew Price took his own life while on licence under an imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence 10 years after his release from jail.\nJohn Hobson said Mr Price's mental health \"had been adversely affected\" by the continuing impact of the sentence.\nThe Ministry of Justice said it was taking action to help IPP offenders \"move on with their lives\".\nIPPs were introduced in 2005 for serious offenders whose crimes did not merit a life sentence, but were abolished in 2012 due to inconsistencies in their application.\nAccording to government data , as of 30 September 2023 there were 1,269 prisoners still serving an IPP who had never been released, while many more were still living on licence following their release.\nUnder current legislation, once released an offender must wait 10 years before becoming eligible to apply to have their licence terminated, though under the proposed Victims and Prisoners Bill that would be cut to three years.\nIf approved the changes would be applied retrospectively, meaning licences would immediately end for around 1,800 rehabilitated offenders.\nMr Price, 48, who spent three years in jail after being convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, died on 16 June 2023 when he was hit by a train at Cottingley Railway Station. His death was recorded as a suicide.\nAt the time of his death he had initiated the process of making an application to have his licence terminated, with his review due to be heard in November 2023, the inquest heard.\nIn a prevention of future deaths report sent to Justice Secretary Alex Chalk, the coroner said: \"Matthew's mental well-being had been adversely affected over a significant period of time by the continuing impact of serving an [IPP].\n\"He was especially anxious that seeking help in respect of his mental health could impact negatively when making an application to discharge the sentence further to its imposition in 2010.\"\nMr Hobson also noted that in 2023 the government had rejected calls to resentence offenders still in custody under the terms of an IPP, and a subsequent report by the Independent Monitoring Boards which spoke of the \"increased hopelessness\" of those affected.\nHe went on to say that as a consequence of undertaking Mr Price's inquest \"the on-going wellbeing of those serving IPP sentences, be that in prison estate or in the community, is a matter of concern to me\".\nHe said: \"The Ministry of Justice is fully apprised of the IPP context and whilst matters have been raised by the IMB I am concerned that specific focus upon the welfare of individuals living in the community should be appraised by those who may be able to take appropriate steps to further support an evidently vulnerable section of society.\"\nResponding to the report, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts remain with the friends and family of Matthew Price.\n\"We have taken decisive action to curtail licence periods to give rehabilitated people the opportunity to move on with their lives and have mental health support in place for IPP offenders living in the community who are at risk of self-harm or suicide.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

We couldn't fall apart when Ellie died,\" said Mary.\n'We had to update our wills'\nThe couple decided to go down the surrogacy route and travelled to Ukraine in August 2021 for medical appointments and to get the embryos created.\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, the surrogacy clinic evacuated the embryos but last year the couple were contacted to say the process could restart.\nThe embryos were successfully planted in the surrogate and the couple travelled to Kyiv in late January ahead of the baby being born.\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth office advises against all travel to Ukraine's capital.\n\"We had to update our wills and sign guardianship forms for our son who is back at home in case we didn't come back. It's very scary,\" said Ms McDonnell.\nThe couple's baby, Jaunty Beau, was born on 31 January.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI from Kyiv, Ms McDonnell said the situation was \"terrifying\".\n'Don't let us get blown up'\n\"The air raid alarm goes off at night and you have four minutes to get to the shelter and you just have to lift the baby and run and that's what we do,\" she said.\n\"It's a very scary place, the people are very good to us and in the bomb shelter they gave us a couch to sit on with the baby.\n\"We're very frightened and every day you say please let us survive today, don't let us get blown up, because we have a boy at home, we want to survive.\"\nThe McDonnells said they had not been able to leave Ukraine as Jaunty Beau had not been issued with a British passport.\n\"There are a lot of legalities and paperwork. The next stage is an identity interview with Peter to look at his photographs, make sure he is who he says he is and that it's not child trafficking or anything like that,\" said Ms McDonnell.\nThe couple had a meeting scheduled with the passport office on 13 March and had been appealing for the meeting to be expedited.\nAfter the couple spoke about their experience on Friday morning, the passport office contacted them to arrange an emergency meeting.\nThe passport office confirmed to the family that a passport has been issued for Jaunty Beau.\nIt should arrive in Ukraine in around 10 days and then the family will be able to travel home.\nEarlier on Friday, the first and deputy first ministers said they would be contacting the Home Office on behalf of the family.\nSpeaking before the passport had been approved, Ms McDonnell explained how Jaunty Beau had been unwell shortly after he was born and had to be rushed to hospital.\n\"He stopped breathing and turned blue, the doctors think he could have something wrong with his brain,\" she said.\n\"The recommendation is to get him home to be treated by doctors in Belfast but they can't move the interview forward.\"\nMs McDonnell said their son Max, who stayed in Northern Ireland, was \"starting to struggle\" without his parents.\nHe is still helping on the family farm milking the cows and is sitting his exams.\n\"He's still struggling with the death of his sister, but he's being very brave,\" she said.\nSurrogacy is legal in Ukraine and while the McDonnell family understand some of the controversy around surrogate births, they said, following the death of Ellie, it was the right choice for their family.\n\"This is our new beginning and the next part of our lives,\" said Ms McDonnell.\n\"For us as a family it has given us hope to survive and to live again for ourselves and for Max, he lost his sister but he now has a brother.\n\"I go to Mass and I pray really hard but it's our way to survive and maybe take the silence out of our house.\n\"When a child dies, your house goes very quiet and now there's going to be a noise in the house.\"",

    "Inevitably enough, Taylor Swift was the biggest-selling artist in the world last year - but new figures from the recording industry suggest that Western artists have lost their grip on the charts.\nFour of 2023's top 10 best-selling acts came from South Korea, with bands such as Stray Kids and Seventeen outselling stars like Drake and The Weeknd.\nThe international sales figures were compiled by the IFPI, which represents the global music industry. Bad Bunny and Lana Del Rey also made the top 10.\nAlthough none of the South Korean bands in the list have broken the UK Top 40, they are responsible for millions of streams around the world, as K-Pop continues its phenomenal growth.\nIn the 12 years since Psy's Gangnam Style, the genre has continually expanded its reach - even making a notable impact on America's typically impenetrable music industry.\nThe charge was led by boyband phenomenon BTS, whose high-concept anthems (with references to Carl Jung and Herman Hesse) found them topping the charts worldwide, even before their swerve into English-language pop on hits like Butter and Dynamite.\nIn 2019, they became the first K-Pop band to headline Wembley Stadium. Within two years, they were performing at the Grammys and collaborating with Coldplay.\nTheir female counterparts, Blackpink, have achieved similar levels of success - last year headlining both the Coachella festival in California, and London's BST Hyde Park.\nTheir success can be chalked up bleeding-edge pop hits like Whistle, Ddu-du Ddu-du and Shut Down, the latter of which samples Paganini's second violin concerto.\nBut neither band featured in the IFPI's best-seller list: BTS are on hiatus while its members complete compulsory military service; while Blackpink spent the latter half of 2023 renegotiating their contracts with YG Entertainment - the media conglomerate that put the band together in 2016.\nEntertainment companies like YG and Big Hit, which represents BTS, are the main engine of K-Pop's success, putting their acts through gruelling auditions and years of training before they're revealed to the public.\n\"If you were on an Olympic team you would have to be trained and we see no difference,\" Chris Lee, head of SM Entertainment told The Guardian in 2022.\n\"If they want to be the best in the world, it takes a lot of work. They get media training. They study languages so that they can communicate with many different audiences. We teach them how to have good personalities.\"\nLast year, Blackpink singer Ros\u00c3\u00a9 told James Corden how arduous the K-Pop regime could be.\n\"We wake up at like 9 to get ready, then we go at 11am and we practice all through 2am - we all come home at 2am, even on weekends,\" the 26-year-old said of the band's six-traineeship, during which the then-teenage members were separated from their families.\n\"We weren't really looking back to our homes or anything. We were just like, let's survive this.\"\nBut the success of K-Pop is down to more than military-grade bootcamps.\nStylistic detours\nStray Kids, in particular, have won an ardent fanbase for their dark and experimental albums, which fuse elements of hip-hop, dubstep, heavy metal, electro-clash and jittery dance pop.\nThe eight piece - Felix, Changbin, Lee Know, Han, Seungmin, I.N, Bang Chan and Hyunjin - are unusual in that they write most of their own material.

Seismic institutes had recorded large underwater explosions just before.\nSoon after, Swedish prosecutors said that traces of explosives had been found on several objects recovered from the site and stated that the explosions had been due to \"gross sabotage\".\nThe pipelines were built by Russia's gas giant Gazprom. Nord Stream 1 was operational from 2011 to 2022. Nord Stream 2 was completed in 2021, but never used because Germany halted the project days after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nDanish police said that the investigation, which was carried out with the Danish intelligence agency PET, had been \"complicated and extensive\" and said it would not provide further comment on the case.\nReacting to the Danish police's statement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"The situation is close to absurd.\n\"On the one hand, they recognise that a deliberate sabotage took place, but on the other hand they are not moving forward.\"\nAn investigative report by four Nordic public broadcasters in 2023 found Russian ships to have been involved in suspicious movements in the area in the months leading up to the blasts.\nMoscow denies responsibility, saying the US and UK were to blame.\nLast year, US intelligence officials told the New York Times newspaper that a pro-Ukrainian group might have plotted the attack.

    "Dune 2 star Zendaya says the costumes she had to wear while filming in the desert were like wearing \"a Doc Marten\".\nThe actress, 27, appears with close friend Timoth\u00c3\u00a9e Chalamet in the long-awaited sci-fi sequel to the 2021 hit.\nBut she told 1Xtra that the elaborate armour the cast wore on set was \"like one boot\".\nSpeaking to breakfast show host Nadia Jae , Zendaya said that the costume took some breaking in.\n\"When you first put it on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 your shoulders hurt like everything's been squeezed in,\" she said.\n\"Then after a while you start to get some more mobility going.\"\nAnd she admitted that filming in Jordan, in Middle East, could get a little uncomfortable.\n\"It keeps the heat in\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 so that's not great. But it looks great and that's all that matters,\" she said.\nZendaya plays Chani in the long-awaited sequel to the 2021 sci-fi epic, which has received mostly positive reviews from critics.\nThe film follows the journey of Timoth\u00c3\u00a9e's character Paul Atreides and his noble family, who are locked in a war over the desert planet Arrakis.\nBut despite the galactic setting, Zendaya says the co-stars were concentrating on a more down-to-Earth theme - the romance between their characters.\nShe said director Denis Villeneuve emphasised \"how important this love story was going to be\".\n\"No matter who you are or where you're from, everyone can connect to this idea of love,\" she said.\n\"So it was our job to dig that out.\"\nZendaya said her character - a member of the planet's native Fremen race - initially has \"a fear\" of Paul - \"even a hatred for what he represents\".\nSo she said the challenge for the actors was breaking down \"a wall\" between the two \"to give people a love story that feels true\".\nZendaya says working with good friend Timoth\u00c3\u00a9e made the film's creative process easier.\n\"It's a good thing because you can create a space where you feel like there's no bad ideas,\" she said.\n\"And in that you have to throw a lot of ideas around and bounce good and bad things around to try to figure [it] out.\n\"Being able to be around people where you're comfortable enough to be like: 'Oh, well, that didn't work. Let's try that again'.\"\nIn Dune: Part One, Zendaya was reportedly only on screen for about seven minutes , but Chani plays a much bigger role in part two.\nMost of her filming on the first happened in the space of about a week or in reshoots, and she felt \"incredibly grateful for the opportunity\" to be a part of the sequel.\n\"I didn't really get to know her [Chani]. Because we see her through Paul's visions and through his eyes [in the first film],\" Zendaya said.\n\"Now we get to see her through her own eyes and who she is. And that's really exciting for me.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",

    "Funeral costs can be a \"crushing anxiety\" for families coping with bereavement, according to the charity Quaker Social Action.\nAfter two years of falls, the average cost of a basic funeral in the UK has risen to \u00c2\u00a34,141, SunLife has reported.\nThe cheapest option, a direct cremation with no funeral service or attendees, cost \u00c2\u00a31,498 in 2023, the insurer's Cost of Dying report said.\nWe asked funeral experts for their tips on paying for end-of-life ceremonies.\nDirect cremation\nDirect cremations are a good option for families who prefer to focus on the memorial service rather than having a funeral ceremony, according to Poole-based funeral services firm Tapper & Son.\nDirector Steven Tapper says: \"People don't have to have a funeral. The unattended cremation has been on the increase in recent years.\n\"That's considerably less expensive and people are then at liberty to have services of their own description, a memorial service with family and friends at any location they want.\n\"There's no need to have a hearse, a limousine and bearers [to carry the coffin] if they don't want to have it.

    "Yuliana Dominguez Paez, a 24-year-old student at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, was going to miss the mysterious assembly that her faculty had scheduled on Monday morning.\nStuck in New York City's interminable traffic, she asked a friend to FaceTime her with any news.\nFrom the other end of the line, \"all I heard was screams,\" she said. \"And, 'free tuition.'\"\nBack on campus, Dr Ruth Gottesman had just changed the lives of Ms Dominguez Paez and her peers.\nThe college's former professor, philanthropist, and widow of a major Wall Street financier announced to a packed auditorium that she was donating $1bn (\u00c2\u00a3790m), with the intention of eliminating tuition fees for those studying medicine at this school in the Bronx .\nThe students screamed. They cheered. They called their mums. In the back of an Uber, Ms Paez cried. \"When I got back to campus\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I just hugged all my friends, because this is life-changing for all of us.\"\nAs the US grapples with a student debt crisis and political solutions seem far out of reach, Albert Einstein College of Medicine has suddenly charted a different course.\nAfter being relieved of as much as six figures of debt, students told the BBC they could suddenly envision goals that had felt financially out of reach. They spoke of starting families, buying homes - and embarking on a career guided not by the need to repay a mountain of loans, but by giving back to their communities and bolstering underserved areas of medicine.\nLess than 24 hours after Dr Gottesman's announcement, five students sat down with the BBC in the sunshine of a campus courtyard to share their new ideas about the future.\n\"It felt like an answered prayer,\" said Sam Woo, a first-year medical student from the Midwest who wants to focus on addiction medicine and providing healthcare to low-income patients.\nWhen he arrived a few months ago, he believed he would have to take on extra jobs and burden himself with loans to pursue a degree and support his family.\n\"Something that I think about a lot when choosing my career path is money, because it's really important for me. I come from a low-income background and street outreach is not the most lucrative field,\" Mr Woo, 23, said. \"But now I don't have to worry about, 'Okay, I should choose a specialty that pays more, so I can support people back home and so I can support myself.' I can actually do things I'm really passionate about.\"\nThe private university charged $59,000 annually for its four-year medical programme, which Ms Dominguez Paez - a member of student group First Generation/Low Income Partnership - said was too pricey for many.\nAmerican medical schools are typically very expensive, and many doctors begin their careers with six-figure debts. In 2023, medical students in the US on average graduated with $250,995 in student loan debt, according to an analysis by the Education Data Initiative. That sum can take decades to pay off.\nDr Peter Campbell, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the college, said eliminating the financial burden meant his students were able to choose their paths in medicine without worrying about what it might pay.\nHe described Monday as \"unquestionably the happiest day\" he had experienced in 20 years of teaching, including three at Einstein.\n\"We saw all our students coming in, they were absolutely electric,\" he said. \"I've never seen 20-something year-olds collectively that happy in my life. There was just so much pure happiness.\"\nThe students will still have to pay for costs like housing, food, test preparation, and registering for exams - costs that can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. But there is no question that the new policy could prove to be transformative for the approximately 1,000 current students.\nStudents already in their fourth year of medical school would have their spring semester reimbursed, according to Elaine Iandoli, a spokeswoman. She said that tuition would be funded in perpetuity from interest on the $1bn donation.\nTrevor Barker, a 25-year-old from California, said his classmates were talking about getting married or having children sooner than they had previously thought, thanks to their freedom from loans.\nAt the same time, the students said, the school now had a responsibility to diversify its admissions, and provide a pathway to a medical career for applicants from the surrounding community.  The Bronx is the poorest borough in New York City and is ranked among the least healthy counties in the state.\nAccording to the school's statistics, nearly half of its MD students are white. Eleven percent are Hispanic or Latino, and only 5% are black. The demographics are fairly similar for its PhD program. Meanwhile, 44% of Bronx County residents are black, and 56% of its residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, according to 2020 census data.\n\"I feel like what I'm most excited to see is seeing an increase in applications that reflect the population in the Bronx,\" said Ms Dominguez Paez. \"Because n",
    "Pop star Kate Bush has been announced as an ambassador for this year's Record Store Day, on 20 April.\nBush said it was a \"great privilege\" to support the initiative, which champions independent record shops and vinyl collectors across the UK.\n\"Isn't it great to see how the resurgence in vinyl has taken the music industry by surprise?\" she said.\n\"It had decided to leave vinyl far behind, but it would seem that not everyone agrees! I love that!\"\nShe added: \"I know there are many, many artists who are just as excited to see the audience turning the tide.\"\nThis year's Record Store Day will see hundreds of limited edition, one-off albums and singles released, with titles by David Bowie, The 1975, Olivia Rodrigo, Notorious BIG, The Beatles, De La Soul and Gorillaz amongst the most sought-after items.\nAs an ambassador, Bush will help to promote the event - which often generates long queues of record collectors, as well as in-store performances and other special events.\nThe star will also lend her support by releasing a special 10-inch vinyl of Eat The Music, from her 1993 album Red Shoes.\nInitially intended as the album's lead single, it was scrapped in favour of the more radio-centric Rubberband Girl. The Record Store Day release features the original artwork, printed directly onto the disc, instead of on the record sleeve itself.\n\"The title, Eat the Music, is meant to be a playful nod to 'If music be the food of love, play on,'  from Shakespeare's Twelfth Night,\" Bush explained in a statement.\nWhile she has not released new music since 2011, Bush has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to the use of Running Up That Hill in hit sci-fi show Stranger Things.\nAfter exploding on TikTok, it went to number one in the UK charts, and gave Bush her first top 10 hit in the US - just 38 years after it was first released.\nAnnouncing her appointment as Record Store Day ambassador, Bush also reflected on the appeal of vinyl records, and the listening experience they fostered.\n\"In the same way that some people like to read a book on Kindle but also want to have a book as a physical object, a lot of people like vinyl and streaming,\" she wrote. \"Both have different appeals.\n\"The added bonus of vinyl is that it encourages people to listen to albums. An art form that I've always thought can be treasured in a unique way.\n\"An album on vinyl is a beautiful thing, given a strong identity by its large-scale artwork. There's a much more personal connection with the artist and their work.\"\nShe concluded with a message for fans of her music, and Record Store Day itself.\n\"This year, I hope you have a fantastic time at this very important event, and that you get to celebrate music that's been specially released for you.\n\"Very best wishes, Kate\".\nThis year's edition of Record Store Day arrives as sales of vinyl hit a 33-year high in the UK.\nSales rose by 11.7% to 5.9 million units in 2023, increasing for the 16th year in a row, according to data from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\nTaylor Swift's 1989 (Taylor's Version) was the best-selling LP, followed by the Rolling Stones' Hackney Diamonds.\nRecord Store Day is supported by BBC 6 Music , and you can read a full list of this year's exclusives on the campaign's official website.",
    "Former Tory deputy chairman Lee Anderson has been suspended from the party after \"refusing to apologise\" for comments aimed at Sadiq Khan.\nThe Conservative Ashfield MP told GB News on Friday \"Islamists\" had \"got control\" of the mayor of London.\nResponding on Saturday, Mr Khan described the remarks as \"pouring fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred\".\nMr Anderson said his comments had put the chief whip and PM in a \"difficult position\".\nLosing the Conservative whip essentially expels Mr Anderson from his party in Parliament.\nJust over an hour after Mr Khan's criticism, a spokesperson for the Tory party's chief whip Simon Hart said: \"Following his refusal to apologise for comments made yesterday, the chief whip has suspended the Conservative whip from Lee Anderson MP.\"\nSpeaking on GB News Mr Anderson said: \"I don't actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they've got control of Khan and they've got control of London\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He's actually given our capital city away to his mates.\"\nPressure then mounted on Rishi Sunak to take action over the comments from the Ashfield MP after Mr Khan criticised a \"deafening silence\" from the prime minister and his Cabinet.\nUntil January Mr Anderson served as one of the deputy chairmen of the Conservative Party, but he resigned so he could rebel against the government over the Rwanda vote.\nPosting his reaction to losing the whip on social media Mr Anderson said: \"Following a call with the chief whip, I understand the difficult position that I have put both he and the prime minister in with regard to my comments.\n\"I fully accept that they had no option but to suspend the whip in these circumstances.\n\"However, I will continue to support the government's efforts to call out extremism in all its forms - be that anti-Semitism or Islamophobia.\"\nEarlier on Saturday afternoon, Mr Khan responded to the comments Mr Anderson first made on GB News which he described as \"Islamophobic, anti-Muslim and racist\".\n\"These comments pour fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred,\" Mr Khan said.\nThe London mayor added he was \"unclear why Rishi Sunak and members of his Cabinet\" were not calling out the remarks or condemning the comments.\nMr Anderson's initial remarks have prompted criticism from some Tories, including former chancellor Sir Sajid Javid who said the remarks were \"ridiculous\".\nThe Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said it welcomed Mr Anderson's suspension but claimed it has \"only taken place after widespread disgust\".\nA MCB spokesman said: \"The Conservative Party has an Islamophobia problem. They need to own up to it.\"",
    "Two years after Russia invaded Ukraine, one refugee who came to the UK says many have nowhere to return to as their homes \"no longer exist\".\nThe outbreak of war forced 143,727 Ukrainians to seek refuge in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.\nIryna Tyazhkorob said it was a \"five-minute decision\" to come to the UK through the scheme in May 2022.\nShe now lives in Shoreham, West Sussex and volunteers to support other Ukrainians who have made the move.\nAccording to the Home Office as of 20 February, Kent, East and West Sussex, and Surrey had welcomed 12,904 Ukrainians.\nVolunteering in Ukraine\nIryna had previously done volunteering work in Ukraine, where she helped organised a shelter for over 100 people.\n\"For three months people lived in the shelter and two babies were born there,\" she said.\nOnce she arrived in West Sussex she naturally decided to volunteer to support other Ukrainians.\nIryna says she recognises how challenging it is for the thousands of people to integrate into a foreign country.\nIn the beginning Iryna said there were feelings of isolation due to the language barrier.\nShe said: \"Ukrainians were arriving and arriving, and nobody knew what to do.\"\nAfter volunteering in churches and other local organisations Iryna helped to establish the Adur Ukraine Association .\nPromoting Ukrainian heritage and culture, the support network has focused on rallying around the Ukrainian community now living in Sussex.\nOn Saturday the group is remembering the anniversary at the Artisans Market near the war memorial in Shoreham.\nFinding a new home\nIrina Garmash-Creeger, a Ukrainian-born Woking resident says \"the community spirit is alive\" in Surrey.\nWith the highest number of arrivals in the UK, the county has welcomed 3,952 Ukrainians.\nAlong with Carolyn Drury-Burroughs, Irina has played a key role in supporting the \"challenging\" application process for the Homes for Ukraine scheme.\nIrina said as people approached her and Carolyn for help with the process they created their own system to match hosts to guests.\nShe explained: \"I could see that people will be easily matched if they knew each other, so the solution was very simple, we started doing interviews for people looking for sponsors and people wanting to be hosts.\"\nThe pair recognised the need to consider \"the human factor\".\nAfter submitting 200 applications, Irina said they lost count. \"We were helping anyone we could.\n\"In the beginning, it was 24/7 calls and interviews every single evening. We had to consider some people were underground and couldn't make a call.\"\n'Home away from home'\nIrina and Carolyn said they became a bridge between the people in need and the people wanting to help.\nFollowing the arrivals, Irina said: \"We realised people would need support locally.\"\nAnd so in June 2022 Ukraine UK Unity was established.\nOffering English lessons, job support and a Saturday school for Ukrainian children, the hub in Woking has become known as a \"home away from home\" for the Ukrainian people.\nIn 2022 Irina's efforts were recognised by Surrey County Council when she won The Make It Happen Community Hero Award.\nIrina said: \"What began as a volunteering organisation at the Lighthouse in Woking, has progressed into a real community effort.\"\nSponsoring refugees\nIn Guildford, Rob and Beverly Walker became sponsors after seeing the government's appeal for people with extra rooms. With their children no longer living at home they applied for the scheme.\nThey have been hosting Andri since May 2022 and said: \"We would have him here as long as he needs to be here.\"\nBeverly who attends the weekly meetings at the Ukraine UK Unity hub described the support in Woking as \"incredible\".\nShe said: \"Irina is always willing to help even though we're not in her council, it's nice knowing someone is there.\"\nCarolyn Drury-Burroughs said: \"It was important for there to be a support network for the hosts as it's difficult to have long term guests.\"\nSupport for hosts\nIn Ashford, Kent, Paul and Bernadette Restorick were sponsors to mother and daughter Oksana and Yelizaveta for 18 months.\nPaul said: \"Ours was one of the best success stories.\n\"Quite soon after they arrived we got Oksana a job in the village pub and we got Yelizaveta a full scholarship to a private school - the daughter is a gifted musician.\"\nThey have since returned to Ukraine.\nPaul said the application process was \"difficult\", describing it as \"cumbersome\" for early applicants.\n\"We had separate accommodation to offer, we were very lucky, we got our support payment and it worked for everybody.\"\nPaul said: \"If they had stopped the payments then we would have really of started asking our Ukrainians for a contribution. Whilst we love to do good we can't just do good every month of the year for 12 months.\n\"The energy costs had kicked in massively, it would have been a very expensive exercise without the support we had.\"\nMr Restorick said they were receiving \u00c2\u00a3600 per calendar month.\nA spokesperson for Kent County Council ",
    "Nvidia's market value has touched $2tn (\u00c2\u00a31.58tn), a new milestone in the chipmaker's rapid ascent into the ranks of the world's most valuable companies.\nShares in the Silicon Valley firm rose more than 4% in morning trade on Friday before dropping back a bit.\nThe gains extended a jump after the company's blockbuster earnings report this week.\nThe company is benefiting from advances in artificial intelligence (AI), which have powered demand for its chips.\nTurnover at the firm more than doubled last year to more than $60bn, and boss Jensen Huang told investors this week that demand was \"surging\" around the world.\nThe company, which became worth $1tn less than a year ago, now ranks as the world's fourth most valuable publicly traded company, behind Microsoft, Apple and Saudi Aramco.\nAfter shares retreated from their early Friday highs, the firm's market value ended the day just below $2tn.\nFounded in 1993, Nvidia was originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games.\nLong before the AI revolution, it started adding features to its chips that it says help machine learning, investments that have helped it gain market share.\nIt is now seen as a key company to watch to see how fast AI-powered tech is spreading across the business world.\nThe price of the firm's shares has more than tripled over the last 12 months, from less than $240 apiece to nearly $800 in mid-day trade on Friday.\nOn Thursday, the day after its earnings report, buyers snapping up shares pushed its value up by $277bn, Wall Street's largest one-day gain in history.\nThe report has also helped to drive a broader market rally, appearing to convince investors that, as Derren Nathan of Hargreaves Lansdown put it, the boom in AI was \"living up to the hype\".\n\"It's being used in automotive for design, it's being used in telecommunications for planning networks, it's being used in mainstream companies to figure out and get insights into data that they haven't been able to get before,\" Bob O'Donnell, a US-based technology analyst told the BBC earlier this week.\n\"This is now really starting to hit the kinds of companies across the board, not just specialised tech companies and that's a real tipping point for the industry.\"",
    "Record numbers of people have researched CPR after a footballer talked about collapsing during a game, a health charity has said.\nLuton Town's Tom Lockyer urged people to go to the British Heart Foundation (BHF) website and learn CPR in media interviews earlier this week.\nThe BHF said staff had been \"blown away\" by the response.\nOne manager said \"unprecedented numbers\" had looked for an online CPR \"tool\".\nThe 29-year-old defender collapsed after a cardiac arrest during a Premier League match against Bournemouth in December.\nThe Welsh international has told how he was \"technically dead\" for two minutes and 40 seconds and was resuscitated by medics.\n\"We've been blown away by the public response to Tom Lockyer's interviews telling the story of how he collapsed on the pitch and was saved thanks to prompt CPR and defibrillation,\" Lizzie Moscardini, BHF programme manager for health partnerships and community resuscitation, told the BBC.\n\"We are also incredibly grateful to him for encouraging people to learn CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation] using our online tool ReviR, and have seen unprecedented numbers of visits to our website by people looking for the tool.\"\n\"Thank you to Tom for helping to raise awareness of learning this vital skill - we hope by speaking out he will be helping to save lives and improve survival rates.\"\nLockyer says he will put his family's considerations first before any decision on a possible comeback following his health scare.\nHe said the thought of leaving his pregnant girlfriend alone to raise a child was \"heart-breaking\".\nLockyer said he was \"forever grateful\" to the medical staff who were quickly on hand to save him.\nHe has had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fitted, which is designed to restart his heart instantly in case of a similar occurrence.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "France has expelled a \"radical\" imam who made \"unacceptable remarks\" about the country's flag, Interior Minister G\u00c3\u00a9rald Darmanin has said.\nMahjoub Mahjoubi appeared to call the French flag \"satanic\" in a video that went viral online earlier this week.\nMr Darmanin said France's immigration reforms had enabled the swift deportation of the imam.\nBut the imam denies any wrongdoing and said he had not meant to be disrespectful.\nMahjoub Mahjoubi, who hails from Tunisia but came to France 38 years ago, was an imam at the Ettaouba mosque in the small town of Bagnols-sur-C\u00c3\u00a8ze, in the south of France.\nHe was arrested earlier this week after a video circulated online showing him describing a \"tricolour flag\" as \"satanic\" and saying it has \"no value with Allah\".\nAlthough he did not refer to a specific flag, many of the comments under the video assumed he meant the French flag.\nThe imam said later he was sorry if he had caused any offence, arguing that his remarks about the flag were a \"slip of the tongue\".\nOn Thursday, Mr Darmanin wrote on X that he had asked for an expulsion order to be issued for Mahjoub Mahjoubi, and praised tough new immigration laws that makes it easier for France to deport foreign residents.\n\"Without the immigration law, this would not have been possible. Firmness is the rule\", the interior minister wrote.\nFrench media published some of the expulsion order, which said the imam had promoted a \"retrograde, intolerant, and violent image of Islam, likely to encourage behaviour contrary to the values of the Republic\".\nIt said his teachings encouraged discrimination against women, \"tensions with the Jewish community\" and \"jihadist radicalisation\". According to the order, he had also referred to Jewish people as \"the enemy\".\nHe was expelled \"less than 12 hours after his arrest\", Mr Darmanin said in another post , adding that the new laws \"makes France stronger\".\n\"We won't let anything go,\" he warned.\nFrance's immigration reforms have reduced protections for foreign residents and made it easier for them to be deported if they get a criminal conviction or are deemed to be a \"grave threat to public order\".\nFrench media reported that Mahjoub Mahjoubi had boarded a flight back to Tunisia on Thursday evening.\nHis lawyer said they would appeal his deportation.",
    "Reddit users have been reacting with deep gloom to the firm saying it plans to sell shares to the public.\nThe \"beginning of the end\", \"good while it lasted\", and \"they ruined it\", are just some of the comments made by Redditors, as they are known, since the announcement on Thursday .\nThe company has said its plans are \"exciting\" and will offer the business opportunities for growth.\nHowever many users worry the move will fundamentally change the website.\nReddit, which was founded almost twenty years ago, is an online forum where users can post questions and comment on topics that interest them.\nMore than 76 million people, on average, visited every day in December 2023, drawn by features like its recurring \"ask me anything\" threads, in which participants ranging from anonymous ordinary people to former US president Barack Obama field questions.\nSome feel the initial public offering (IPO) which has been filed with US regulators will change the site's spirit.\n\"When the most important customers shift from [users] to shareholders, the product always [suffers],\" said one person.\n\"It becomes 'what can we do this quarter to squeak out an additional point of revenue', instead of 'how can we make this product better'.\"\nHistory of protest\nIt is far from the first time Reddit's most vocal users have expressed displeasure at the platform.\nIn 2023, thousands of Reddit communities became inaccessible in protest at how the site was being run - in particular controversial charges for developers of third-party apps, which are used to browse the platform.\nSome of the biggest Reddit communities then began only allowing photos and videos of comedian John Oliver , following votes from disgruntled users.\nBut this proved to be short-lived, and Reddit's plan ultimately proved financially beneficial, as it has struck a deal with Google reportedly worth $60m (\u00c2\u00a347m) so the tech giant can use Reddit posts to train artificial intelligence tools.\nThe filing does not say how much money the firm is hoping to raise by listing on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBut it provides a glimpse of the firm's operations, including its struggles to turn its online popularity into profit.\nIt was valued at about $10bn in a private fundraising round in 2021.\nBut the company has recorded losses every year since its start, including more than $90m last year.\nIn the filing, Reddit said it had not started trying to make money seriously until 2018. It reported $804m in revenue last year, up more than 20% from 2022.\nAdvertising accounted for nearly all of the revenue, but in a note to prospective investors chief executive Steve Huffman said he was excited about opportunities to make the platform a venue for commerce and license its content to AI companies.\n\"I have never been more excited about Reddit's future than I am right now,\" Mr Huffman wrote. \"We have many opportunities to grow both the platform and the business, the latter through advertising, monetizing commerce on the platform, and licensing data.\"\nReddit's IPO would be the first by a social media company since Pinterest in 2019.\nIt comes as financial markets in the US are regularly notching new highs, buoyed by optimism over the economy and a new wave of growth powered by artificial intelligence.",

    "A nature reserve manager who suffered a mini-stroke is hanging up his boots after 11 years of saving salmon and re-meandering rivers.\nLee Schofield, who is based at Haweswater, said the decision had been \"agonising\" but he was \"burned out\".\nThe 44-year-old said writing his book, Wild Fell, in the early hours, then being on his feet all day had taken its toll.\nHe will now work at Lowther Estate part time and concentrate on his writing.\nMr Schofield said writing the book had generated \u00c2\u00a3200,000 in donations for the RSPB from readers and he was \"immensely proud\".\n\"Working for the RSPB at Haweswater has genuinely been the experience of a lifetime, and I've been agonising about what to do for the past few months,\" he said.\n\"My burning drive to help nature and the climate is what gets me out of bed in the morning.\n\"Being one small player in a growing environment movement is hugely invigorating and, as frightening as the prospects of the climate and biodiversity crises are, I remain hopeful that we can pull ourselves back from the brink.\"\nHe said being among the bilberry and heather at Haweswater was his natural habitat and he is soon to move to a farm next to the nature reserve, and will commute to his new job.\nIn his final blog before starting his new role in the next few weeks, Mr Schofield said he was moved by more than 140 comments from well-wishers.\nHe said career highlights have included helping hay meadows return to \"flowery richness\" and seeing grouse return to recovering heathlands.\nIn 2016, the RSPB and its partners, including the water company United Utilities, embarked on a re-meandering or \"rewiggling\" project at Swindale Beck - a stretch of river close to Haweswater Reservoir in the Lake District.\nMr Schofield, who was heavily involved in the project, said re-establishing the meandering curves of the beck had slowed down the flow of water encouraging fish to return.\n\"We put the bends back in at the beck, we've done huge amounts of bog restoration, we've brought flowers back to big chunks of meadow, we've planted thousands and thousands of trees.\n\"We've done a huge range of things working with Natural England and United Utilities that I think have really helped to breathe life back into the natural environment.\"\nIn his new role, Mr Schofield will work for three days a week for the Lowther Estate on a new project to create a swathe of land from Penrith to Kendal where nature can thrive.\nHe said having a mini-stroke just before his book was published in February 2022 was a wake-up call, and he now wanted a \"sensible\" work and life balance.\n\"I reduced my hours for the RSPB for a couple of months to get the book finished, but for the rest, I was working full time.\n\"A mini-stroke was an indicator of how burned out I was.\n\"For the sake of my health and my family, that's not something I want to repeat.\"\nHe said that he wanted to \"write more\", and added: \"I'm hoping to change behaviours so we can tackle the environmental emergencies we are facing.\"\nFollow BBC Cumbria on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram .

    "London's canals are normally a quiet haven in the centre of the capital, but now a stretch of the longest one, is covered in a thick yellow greasy scum.\nExperts believe a large section of the Grand Union Canal has been deliberately polluted with dumped cooking oil.\nIt has been declared a category 3 incident by the Environment Agency, which means the clean up operation falls to the charity Canal and Rivers Trust.\nIt estimates that costs will mount up to \u00c2\u00a310,000 a day.\nThe canal is the UK's longest one, linking London to Birmingham, passing through rolling countryside, industrial towns and peaceful villages.\nRos Daniels, director, London and South East region of the Canal and River Trust explained: \"When there are serious incidents the Environment Agency can step in - we have been working with them to help identify the pollutant.\n\"But with lesser incidents we have to pick up the bill and as a charity this is reaching tens of thousands of pounds.\"\nContractors are currently using booms to gather the oil and then remove it.\nThe oil pollution incident stretches for miles along the Grand Union Canal in west London - but the charity warns it could be spreading.\nIt's believed the oil came from from a \"dark kitchen\" - used mainly to cook takeaways for delivery - and was dumped in the canal deliberately.\nThe Canal and River Trust's Alex Patterson added: \"We are pretty clear this is discarded cooking oil and we believe the source is as far as six miles away in Alperton.\n'Very serious'\n\"Not only are we clearing the areas in Paddington and Little Venice, we are also booming off what we believe to be the source.\"\nMr Patterson says the oil spill is \"very serious\" from the charity's perspective - adding it is very difficult to estimate how much oil is in the water.\n\"It gathers in different places, gathering around boats and at the Paddington Basin,\" he added. \"But certainly, there are thousands of litres of cooking oil in the water.\"\nMs Daniels described the incident as \"really distressing\" adding it is up to the charity to \"bear the brunt\" of the clean up effort.\nShe added: \"This is a wonderful resource in the heart of London and for someone to dump their cooking oil into it is really distressing for the wildlife and for everyone who enjoys it as a place to relax and enjoy, and those who live on it away.\"\n\"We are reassured the damage won't be long term but it isn't attractive.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "The City of Edinburgh Council is considering whether the owners of Airbnb-style properties can be charged for bin collections.\nIt comes after some local authorities in England opted to charge short-term lets for waste management or arrange commercial pick-ups.\nThe plans will be considered at the council's environment committee.\nIt follows concerns about the volume of rubbish produced by short-term lets in central Edinburgh.\nScott Arthur, the council's environment convener, said: \"Following feedback from residents, council officers are currently looking at the issue of whether short-term let operators can be charged for their waste collections.\n\"This will be reported to and considered by committee in due course.\"\nAny new charge would be separate to business rates or council tax already paid by owners of Airbnb-style properties.\nHowever, Neil Dishington, who stopped renting out his flat on Airbnb recently due to all the \"overheads\", said the council had gone too far.\nHe had a one-bedroom flat as well as a room in his own house in Edinburgh that he rented out on Airbnb.\nThe 39-year-old engineer told BBC Scotland News: \"I've had to stop doing Airbnb because it wasn't making any money.\n\"And the final nail in the coffin was the new licensing charge.\n\"My view is I don't think guests are generating any more rubbish than if someone was living there normally.\n\"And they don't produce any more waste than students.\n\"As an owner, you pay the council tax contribution so why would the council ask for extra?\n\"It is a crusade against Airbnbs and it's suffocating Edinburgh.\"\nNew regulations for Airbnb-style properties came into effect in Edinburgh in October last year.\nVisitors booking short-term lets in the city were told to look out for licence numbers in adverts to ensure the properties meet the requirements.\nHosts can face fines of \u00c2\u00a32,500 if they have not complied\nMr Dishington added: \"Airbnbs used to be an opportunity for people to welcome tourists into their homes but now all this has been taken away as it's not cost effective any more.\n\"It's very frustrating to see this crusade on Airbnbs in Edinburgh.\"",

    "The former Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, has written in the Daily Telegraph claiming that \"Islamists are now in control of Britain\" after the Commons Speaker said he had ignored protocol during a debate on Gaza because of security threats to MPs. She says Islamists have \"bullied our country into submission\" and the UK is \"sleepwalking into a ghettoised society\" threatening free expression and British values.\nIn an editorial the Times declares that fear is now a factor in British democracy because concern for the safety of MPs clearly played a major role in what the paper describes as the Speaker's \"ill-advised decision to rip up the Commons rule book\". It declares that the threat of terrorist retribution should never govern the deliberations of parliament, and the country should not be ruled by fear.\nAccording to the Daily Mail , setting aside parliamentary procedures in response to intimidation by Islamist extremists and their far-left fellow travellers is not just intolerable, it's is staggeringly self-defeating. It sends the message that political violence works, warns the paper.\nThe Sun says Parliament has surrendered to a \"violent Hamas- backing mob\". In an editorial the paper says this is a shaming, chilling, highly dangerous moment. It says the only reason why the Commons debated a ceasefire in Gaza was for left-wing MPs to assure voters that they backed the Palestinians.\nThe Daily Mail and the Daily Express are asking why police didn't stop pro-Palestinian protesters from beaming a contentious slogan on to Big Ben, during the debate in Parliament. Both papers describe the phrase as genocidal. Scotland Yard said it was not a criminal offence.\nA study which suggested that seeing the same doctor at every visit to a GP practice improves patients' health and reduces doctors' workloads is highlighted by the Guardian . Researchers from the University of Cambridge and Insead Business School analysed data from 10 million consultations in England over more than a decade. They found that people seeing the same doctor have 18% longer intervals between visits compared with those who saw different doctors. That suggests that continuity of care could free up millions of appointments, says the Guardian.\nThe Times says the Fundraising Regulator has begun an investigation after the paper uncovered that people going door to door for a children's charity had been taught pressure-selling techniques. According to the article those signing up households for donations to the Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity were trained at a third-party marketing company to use psychological motivators and pre-empt objections. The charity said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the findings. The marketing company says it has a policy of \"reasonable persuasion\" only.\nAnd the i says the EU could offer the UK a closer trade relationship if Labour wins the general election. The paper says the deal would help businesses import and export goods, including food and cars, but Britain would not be re-joining the EU's single market or customs union. The deal could be agreed in 2026 when the current one comes up for review.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "The largest ever seizure of Class A drugs in the UK, with an estimated street value of \u00c2\u00a3450m, has been uncovered in a shipment of bananas.\nThe 5.7-tonne haul of cocaine was found in a container from South America at Southampton Port on 8 February.\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) said the drugs were heading to Hamburg in Germany and inquiries were ongoing to identify the criminals involved.\nThe previous record was 3.7 tonnes of cocaine, also at Southampton, in 2022.\nAnother 3.2 tonnes of the drug was discovered on board the tug boat MV Hamal in Scotland in 2015.\nA spokesman for the NCA explained the MV Hamal haul was estimated at a value of \u00c2\u00a3512m because of a difference in cocaine prices in Scotland at that time.\nBorder Force officers in Southampton found the record-breaking haul in blocks mixed with bananas after being called to carry out a search of the cargo by the NCA.\nAndy Mason, the NCA's drug threat lead, told BBC News: \"This is a massive financial hit for a crime group and that will seriously disrupt them.\n\"We've seen high levels of seizures across Europe [in recent times] but we are in a cocaine market where production continues to increase in South America.\n\"In Colombia ...since 2020 the production of coca leaf has increased by over 40%, so it's a challenging environment.\"\nThe NCA said the domestic cocaine market is dominated by criminal gangs who are believed to be making about \u00c2\u00a34bn a year in the UK alone.\nChris Farrimond, NCA director, said: \"While the destination for the consignment was continental Europe in this case, I have no doubt that a significant proportion would have ended up back here in the UK, being peddled by UK criminal gangs.\n\"Working closely with UK partners like Border Force, we are determined to do all we can to protect the UK public.\"\nMr Mason added recent work had been undertaken to \"tighten security at ports\" which had led to \"several arrests of port workers who are engaged in assisting cocaine traffickers\".\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "An Indian court has asked a zoo in West Bengal state to change the names of two lions after a hardline Hindu group complained it hurt their religious sentiments.\nThe lioness was named after Hindu deity Sita while the lion was called Akbar, after the 16th Century Mughal ruler.\nVishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) challenged this, saying that naming the lioness after a goddess was blasphemous.\nIt also objected to keeping the lions in the same wildlife park.\nThe two big cats currently live in the North Bengal Wild Animals Park in Siliguri district.\nOn Thursday, the court observed that animals should not be named after \"Hindu gods, Muslim Prophets, [revered] Christian figures, Nobel laureates and freedom fighters\".\n\"You could have named it Bijli [lightning] or something like that.

    "A reggae enthusiast has said digitising and publishing live recordings of sound systems from the 1970s and 1980s will help preserve the genre's history.\nThe sound systems movement saw huge banks of speakers built into houses and on the streets in St Pauls, Bristol.\nAshish Joshi has been collecting \"dozens\" of tapes in Bristol and other cities before they \"disappear forever\".\nHe said videos and audio tapes allow people to see and hear the music in its heyday and \"feel what it was like\".\nThe reggae sound systems movement is understood to have influenced different artists including locals Ronnie Size and Massive Attack.\n\"As it was developing in the 70s, 80s and 90s, the music was so special, the music came from the heart and a lot of that music you don't hear nowadays,\" Mr Joshi said.\n\"It comes from centuries of oppression and was basically put into an audio art form that people could feel.\"\nHe said it is one thing filming veterans from back in the day, and them telling you how great it was, but young people can appreciate what the vibes were like if they can hear the music and be virtually transported back in time.\nWith mainstream radio not playing much reggae music, and before the advent of Bristol's Black pirate radio stations during the latter part of the 1980s, Mr Joshi said reggae sound tapes were an important source of keeping up to date with the latest releases.\n\"They were basically live recordings of reggae sound system dances on tapes, recorded by owners of the sound system and captured the atmosphere, sounds, dance and music played at functions,\" he added.\n\"You can hear the sound system guys talking to the crowd as well as introducing the tunes being played and also rapping over the tunes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it is an authentic experience of reggae music at that time.\"\nTapes were copied and passed between friends and families, offering a cheap way of hearing the latest Reggae music at a time when unemployment was high in the Black community, Mr Joshi said.\nDJ, operator and mic man Snoopy said the movement helped him through life and \"kept me out of trouble\".\nHe played in the city in 1976 after seeing \"one on my cousins with a speaker in his hand\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [and I knew] I just wanted to get involved\".\n\"Bristol was the talk of the world,\" he said. \"You had the Bamboo club and wherever people were in the country they all wanted to come to Bristol for the sounds and the Bamboo club.\n\"Just walking into St Paul's\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [was] pure energy. It was like being home. Like your motherland. The beat of the drum, the tone and the chorus\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 music was a message and it kept people on the straight and narrow,\" he added.\nDJ Skyjuice said sound systems are a \"mobile music discotheque and about the hype, the amplitude of the music we're playing and the vibe\".\n\"It's not just how it sounds, it moves you emotionally. You're on a journey... it's like freedom.\"\nWith about 800-1,000 watts in one speaker, that is banging out the bass notes, bottom notes, he said.\n\"Most stereos aren't going to give you what a sound system is giving you. It gets people in a funny way. It's excitement,\" he said.\nMr Joshi, who has self-funded collecting, digitising and publishing the sound systems, said: \"Sadly a lot of these sound tapes have been thrown away since many people haven't got the equipment to play them anymore.\n\"So if I hear there's a tape someone needs restoring or putting on digital file or video, I'm there like a shot.\n\"Reggae sound system was the beginning. The guys that were into Drum and Bass and the rave scene and house music all got their roots in the reggae sound systems [and] people like Stormzy.\n\"So the sound systems are an important historical record of reggae sound system culture in the UK,\" he added.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Two very different flights in 24 hours, each with the same aim: to alleviate Gaza's suffering.\nThe first is the less perilous: an Etihad Airways passenger plane, flight EY750 from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. The Boeing 777 has been converted into a virtual flying ambulance with seats in economy turned into hospital beds.\nIts mission, paid for by the government of the UAE, is to return civilians who had previously got out after being trapped in Rafah in southern Gaza, in some cases for months, and to evacuate wounded Palestinian children who had crossed from Gaza to al-Arish in Egypt's northern Sinai.\nAfter hours on the ground, the first evacuees start to make it on board. There is relief on their faces as they make it across the airfield to the plane, but uncertainty too. Many have left family members behind in Gaza.\nAmong them is 58-year-old Hanaa Hasan Abu Namous. Her hand is badly injured. She says 25 members of her family were killed in an Israeli air strike on their home in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.\n\"During the war they were displaced,\" she tells me. \"Thirty or 50 of them would come to our house. We are civilians. We never have and never will fight.\"\nShe holds a picture on her phone of shroud-wrapped bodies. They had to be buried together, four or five to a coffin, she says.\nSitting a few rows forward is 13-year-old Yazan Wajih Barhum, whose left foot has been partially amputated. He was at a neighbour's house in Rafah when an Israeli bomb hit, he says.\nHis seven-year-old brother, Yamen, was hit with shrapnel in the eye and is already in Abu Dhabi. When I ask him when they last saw each other he answers, quick as a flash, \"58 days ago\". What are his hopes for the future, I ask.\n\"To be able to walk on my legs again, get back to how I was, play football with my friends, and for the war to end so I can go back to my country\", he says.\nThe crew on board, regular airline staff, hand the 25 injured children backpacks with games and a SpongeBob blanket. The kids who are able sit watching cartoons on the entertainment system; some are on stretchers at the back of the plane.\nKiran Sadasivan, the cabin manager, welcomes the children and their chaperones on board, taking pictures with their phones and distributing meals. \"This is my tenth mission flight,\" he tells me. \"And I'll be on the next one in a few days.\"\nAlso on board is Dr Maha Barakat, the UAE's assistant foreign affairs minister. A UK-trained doctor, she does not rest during the 20-hour evacuation mission, checking on the patients and medical team and liaising with the Egyptian authorities on the ground.\n\"The actual day today was clearly a more challenging day than usual,\" she says. \"There was a particular girl that we were trying to get through - she was in urgent medical need. And she wasn't able to make it to the border. However, we will have another plane coming in the next few days.\"\nNot all the Palestinians on the plane are leaving Gaza. Sitting alone, wearing a dark red headscarf and with a small leather handbag at her side is mother-of-three Zahra Mohammed Al-Qeiq. She has leukaemia, and left Gaza a few months ago for treatment in Abu Dhabi. Now she is returning to Rafah.\nIsn't she scared, I ask her.\n\"The whole period I spent in the Emirates, my kids were crying on calls asking me to come back, saying 'come back; we will die in Gaza'. I had to stop my treatment and go back to my children,\" she says.\nEmirati doctors have given her six months of chemotherapy drugs. \"I cried every night I was away from home. I have to go back, they are my children,\" she says.\nFirst UK aid airdrop\nTwenty-four hours later, a Royal Jordanian Airforce cargo plane - \"Guts Airline\" painted on its side - heads for Gaza at sunset.\nThe aircrew on board have done this flight a dozen times. As they reach 17,000ft (5,200m), they put on oxygen masks and make final precise adjustments for the drop.\nFor the first time, the cargo on board is British: four tonnes of supplies, including fuel, medical gear and food rations, to resupply the Jordanian-run field hospital in Gaza City.\nUntil now Britain has only sent aid by land and sea, but northern Gaza has become almost entirely unreachable. The World Food Programme has suspended deliveries there because its convoys have endured \"complete chaos and violence\", it said.\nThere is a heavy Israeli military presence on the ground. The Jordanian authorities will not disclose what co-ordination is made with Israel to allow the plane to fly overhead without incident.\nIsrael maintains a tight grip on the aid going into Gaza. Britain and others have complained that only a fraction of the aid needed is making it into the strip. Everything is subject to stringent Israeli checks, to prevent supplies making it inside that would aid Hamas.\nMost of the people in this once densely packed part of Gaza have been driven out by Israeli forces, but some 300,000 remain, barely surviving in the most desperate of circumstances.

    "An inquest into the death of Tata Steel contractor has heard he was pinned down by a quad bike whilst working at a reservoir.\nAdam Llewellyn, 41 from Bridgend, died at\u00c2\u00a0Eglwys\u00c2\u00a0Nunydd\u00c2\u00a0Reservoir, Port Talbot, on 5 September 2019.\nThe jury at Swansea Coroner's Court heard that he was using a quad bike to spray weed killer around the reservoir.\nHe was working on behalf of Darlow Lloyd and Sons for Tata Steel that day.\nFollowing a post mortem exam, a pathologist said the preliminary cause of death was traumatic asphyxia, suggesting there was pressure on the chest.\nThe Health and Safety Executive and South Wales Police has been investigating.\nOn the first day of the inquest, the jury heard that Mr Llewellyn had been a farmer and had worked as an agricultural engineer in partnership with his father for many years.\nMr Llewellyn had also been doing contractual work outside of the business, including hedge cutting and spraying, including for Darlow Lloyd and Sons.\nHis father said he was experienced in using a quad bike for spraying work, and that he expected his son to operate the equipment carefully, such as on the day of his death.\nAssistant Coroner Edward Ramsay told the jury that Mr Llewellyn had been found near the reservoir by a colleague.\nEmergency services attended but Mr Llewellyn was pronounced dead at the scene.\nIn a statement read on his behalf, Mr Llewellyn's father described the circumstances surrounding his son's death as \"a tragedy\".\n\"I don't know why the accident occurred. Accidents do occur,\" he said.\n\"It has caused such grief and pain.\"\nAdam Llewellyn's wife said he was a dedicated farmer and family man.\n\"Adam touched so many people's lives,\" Mrs Llewelyn said.\n\"Adam was always ready to help anyone, in any way he could.\n\"He was a proud man, proud of his family, his work, and all he achieved.\"\nTractor replacement\nJonathan Thomas, a department manager from Darlow Lloyd and Sons, told the jury a tractor should have been used for the job, not a quad bike, based on their risk assessment which was reviewed by Tata Steel.\nMr Thomas said he received a call from Mr Llewellyn that morning informing him that he would be late to the job because the tractor had a puncture.\nMr Thomas said he assumed that Mr Llewellyn had the tractor repaired before going to the reservoir.\nHe confirmed he did not know that Mr Llewellyn had been using a quad bike.\nThis could have been picked up by a banksman who was supervising Mr Llewellyn, who also worked for Darlows Lloyd and Sons, said Mr Thomas.\nThe court heard from the supervisor on the day, Stewart Jones, who said he only learned that Mr Llewellyn would use the quad bike when he saw him at the reservoir.\nHe confirmed he knew that Mr Llewellyn should not have been using a quad bike.\nMr Jones said he did question \"whether to let him use it or not\" but he said he trusted Mr Llewellyn's judgement and experience.\nMr Jones said he did not see Mr Llewellyn again that day, as he assisted on other jobs in the steelworks, but he tried to contact him through phone calls toward the end of the afternoon.\nMr Jones said he couldn't get hold of Mr Llewellyn so he went back to the location some hours later, and saw a quad upside down on the bank, and Mr Llewellyn under it.\nHe said he phoned 999, pushed the bike uphill, pulled Mr Llewellyn on to flat ground and started CPR before the paramedics took over.\nThe inquest continues.",
    "A man who killed his millionairess wife with a claw hammer has lost a court bid to be freed from prison.\nJoanna Simpson, 46, was bludgeoned to death by Robert Brown in Ascot, Berkshire, in October 2010.\nThe former British Airways captain was due to be freed in November after serving half of his 26-year jail sentence for manslaughter, but his release was blocked by the government .\nThe High Court dismissed Brown's appeal against the government move.\nThe defendant, formerly of Winkfield, Berkshire, killed Ms Simpson at her home within earshot of their two children, then aged nine and 10, a court previously heard.\nHe buried her body in a pre-dug grave in Windsor Great Park before confessing to the police the following day.\nThe former pilot, then aged 47, was found not guilty of murder after a jury was told the couple's bitter divorce proceedings had put him under great stress.\nHe was sentenced to 24 years for manslaughter and a further two years for an offence of obstructing a coroner.\nIn October 2023, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk referred the case to the Parole Board to decide if Brown could be safely freed from prison, effectively blocking his automatic release the following month.\nAt the High Court, Brown's legal team claimed the referral was improperly motivated.\nHis lawyers said the risk posed by Brown had not increased.\nThey said he had been \"subjected to a high-profile campaign through the media and with politicians that has sought to block his release\".\nHowever, government lawyers said Brown had \"persistently refused to engage in the rehabilitative elements of his sentence\".\nDismissing the appeal, Mr Justice Ritchie wrote that there were \"good grounds for believing\" that Brown posed a \"high risk to the public of serious harm\" and needed full and proper assessment.\nMs Simpson's mother, Diana Parkes, previously met Mr Chalk and his predecessor Dominic Raab in an attempt to stall Brown's release.\nShe commended the court's decision, saying: \"Brown committed the most horrific crime against my loving and caring daughter, Jo. He must be kept in prison.\"\nMs Simpson's best friend Hetti Barkworth-Nanton, who also chairs domestic abuse charity Refuge, said: \"This is a landmark decision which has the potential to open up this new power to other dangerous offenders on determinate sentences who chose not to engage in rehabilitation, which is all too common in cases of serious and fatal domestic abuse.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "The Home Office should consider making protest organisers give a longer notice period to allow the police to better prepare, MPs have said.\nThe Home Affairs select committee is calling on the government to give the police more support, as marches continue over the Israel-Gaza war.\nIt cites the Met Police as saying it is under the \"greatest period of sustained pressure\" since the 2012 Olympics.\nUnder current rules, organisers must give six days notice of a public march.\nLarge demonstrations have been taking place across the UK since the 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas and Israel began its military assault in response to destroy the group in Gaza.\nThe cross-party committee of MPs issued a report in which it found that policing the protests between 7 October and 17 December last year cost forces nationwide more than \u00c2\u00a325m.\nIt also found that demonstrations, and the \"disruptive tactics\" of some participants, were causing \"unsustainable pressure\" on policing resources.\n\"Should these protests continue indefinitely, it stands to reason that forces will be less able to carry out the everyday neighbourhood and response policing that is so vital to the public,\" the report said.\n\"If the protests continue to take place as frequently at this scale, the Home Office should consider amending requirements for protest organisers, such as increasing the notice period for protest organisers to inform the police from the current six days, to allow the police to prepare better.\"\nMPs also highlight that during a three-month period, more than 4,000 officer rest days were cancelled to ensure the protests could be policed safely.\nThe committee criticises the government for a lack of action on the rise in hate crime as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. It also says the hate crime action plan expired four years ago and accuses ministers of not responding to reports on the issue.\nThe committee also expressed concern over protests outside the homes and offices of MPs.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that at least 29,782 people, mostly women and children, have been killed since the war began in October.\nIsrael's military offensive was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on 7 October in which gunmen killed about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and took 253 back to Gaza as hostages.\nThe Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) says the report fails to address \"the increasingly urgent need to... ensure the safety of this country's Jewish community\".\n\"The committee has rightly acknowledged the immediate and severe threat posed to their MP colleagues by intimidation and violent attacks but, despite having extensively quoted our evidence in their report, they do not appear to have treated the threat to the Jewish community with the same degree of alarm,\" a spokesman says.\nHe adds that the call for protest organisers to give more notice \"would not change the actual nature of these marches and therefore solves nothing other than timesheet planning for our overstretched police forces\".\nUnder the Public Order Act 1986, police must be notified at least six days before a public march is intended to take place. The committee report does not detail the precise notice period it is recommending.\nThe BBC has contacted the Home Office for comment.",

    "Actress and director Amy Schumer has revealed she has Cushing's Syndrome, caused by having steroid injections in high doses.\nShe revealed the condition after being swarmed by comments about her face, with fans saying it looked \"puffier\" during recent TV interviews.\nIn her initial response, Schumer attributed the change in her appearance to endometriosis.\nThe subsequent Cushing's diagnosis left her feeling \"reborn\", she said.\n\"There are a few types of Cushing. Some that can be fatal, require brain surgery or removal of adrenal glands,\" the actress told the News Not Noise newsletter .\n\"I have the kind of Cushing that will just work itself out and I'm healthy [which] was the greatest news imaginable,\" she added.\nCushing's syndrome occurs when a person has elevated levels of cortisol, the body's primary stress hormone, inside the body for a long time. It mostly affects people on steroids.\nJessica Yellin, who founded News Not Noise, said she had reached out to Schumer after reading about the online discourse about her appearance.\nSchumer replied that she had sought medical advice after reading the comments.\n\"I was also in MRI machines four hours at a time, having my veins shut down from the amount of blood drawn and thinking I may not be around to see my son grow up,\" she told Yellin.\n\"Aside from fears about my health, I also had to be on camera having the internet chime in.\n\"But thank God for that. Because that's how I realised something was wrong.\"\nSchumer had appeared on US TV earlier this month to talk about season two of the sitcom Life And Beth, which she writes, directs and stars in.\nDuring the promotional tour, the actress, who has also starred in the sketch show Inside Amy Schumer, the 2015 film Trainwreck and 2018's I Feel Pretty, visited The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and The View.\nAfterwards she faced a barrage of jokes mocking her face, as well as medical speculation and supportive comments.\n\"I've enjoyed feedback and deliberation about my appearance,\" she said.\nAdopting a semi-serious tone, the actress added on Instagram that she had endured such speculation \"for almost 20 years [...] as all women do\".\nWhat is Cushing's Syndrome?\nThe NHS website says the syndrome can be serious if not treated, and is uncommon.\nIt is often a result of people taking steroid medicine, especially tablets, for a long time, which contain a synthetic version of cortisol.\nVery rarely, the syndrome can be caused by the body producing too much cortisol, caused by a tumour in the pituitary gland in the brain or in one of the adrenal glands above the kidneys.\nCortisol is known as your \"fight or flight\" hormone. When it sends out alarm signals to the brain in response to stress, it can influence almost every system in the body, from the immune system to digestion and sleep.\nThe syndrome is usually benign [non-cancerous] and most common in young women.\nSymptoms tend to get slowly worse if not treated, and the website said one of the main signs is weight gain and more body fat. Symptoms can include:\nOther symptoms include skin that bruises easily, large purple stretch marks, weakness in your upper arms and thighs, reduced libido and fertility problems, depression and mood swings.\nThe Pituitary Foundation, which provides support about Cushing's Syndrome in the UK, told the BBC they were sorry to hear about Schumer's diagnosis, saying it was \"encouraging to see her raising awareness of her condition\".\nThey wished Schumer \"all the best in her recovery\" and encouraged anyone who thinks they may have it to contact their GP.\n\"Cushing's syndrome is rare, affecting only a few  people in every million, per year,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\"Some people live with symptoms for many years, so raising awareness is key to ensuring that people can get a diagnosis.\"\nThe spokeswoman added that other symptoms could include \"excessive hair growth, irregular periods and feeling more irritable and anxious\".\nSon's name change\nPraising News Not Noise as her \"favourite credible news source\", Schumer said she wanted to \"advocate for women's health\".\n\"I want so much for women to love themselves and be relentless when fighting for their own health in a system that usually doesn't believe them,\" she said.\n\"I want women to value feeling strong, healthy and comfortable in their own skin.\"\nShe has previously spoken about body positivity , and said it was important to \"advocate for self love and acceptance of the skin you're in\".\n\"The only other thing I'd like to add is that this is a good example of the fact that we never know what is going on with someone,\" she said.\n\"Everyone is struggling with something. Maybe we can all be a little kinder to each other and ourselves.\"\nSchumer added that comments about her son's name in 2020 had prompted a similar period of self-reflection.\nThe actress had initially planned to call him Gene Attell, with his middle name a nod to her friend, the comic Dave Attell.\nPeople online were quick to point out that the name \"sounds l",
    "Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is staring down another resounding loss to Donald Trump, this time in her home state of South Carolina. But Ms Haley has vowed not to quit, raising speculation about the ambitions of her long-shot campaign.\nThree days before the state primary, a crowd of Republican voters in North Augusta, South Carolina, packed shoulder-to-shoulder in to the sunny top floor of a municipal building for a Nikki Haley campaign event.\nAs the state's former governor, Ms Haley gave the gathering an assured and newly combative stump speech. She made frequent and pointed jabs at her rival and the Republican frontrunner, former President Donald Trump - a tactic she had long avoided.\n\"He was literally unhinged,\" she said at one point, remarking on his victory speech after the New Hampshire primary. \"He's obsessed with himself,\" she added later.\nIn this room at least, Ms Haley's pitch and criticism of the former president were landing. Her jokes received loud laughs, the applause breaks were long, and at least a dozen voters in attendance told the BBC they were all in on Ms Haley.\n\"She's got an outstanding record,\" said supporter Holt Moran. \"She's just the perfect person.\"\nBut again and again, when asked if Ms Haley had a chance of winning the primary - or even another Republican contest down the line - each voter seemed to wince before saying no.\n\"Unfortunately not,\" Mr Moran said.\nDespite her publicly sunny outlook, the packed events, and beaming crowds, it will be nearly impossible for Ms Haley to find a path to the nomination. She has lost every contest to Mr Trump so far, and is likely to do so again on Saturday, this time in her home state.\nPolls show the former UN ambassador is trailing by nearly 30 points in South Carolina and her odds are even worse in votes to come.\nBarring a dramatic and unforeseen twist, Mr Trump will - for the third time in a row - be his party's nominee. But Ms Haley has so far shown no signs of quitting.\nSo is Ms Haley's enduring campaign a quixotic exercise or - as she says - a principled stand against Mr Trump? Or is she perhaps playing a longer game and laying the groundwork for future political ambitions?\n'I refuse to quit'\nWith pundits and commentators - and her own party leadership - claiming she is wasting Republicans' time and money, Ms Haley has struggled to defend her resolve.\nIn Greenville this week, in what her campaign had billed as a \"state of the race address,\" Ms Haley gave a 26-minute speech devoted entirely to why she still sought the Republican nomination.\n\"I refuse to quit,\" she said. \"South Carolina will vote on Saturday. But on Sunday, I'll still be running for president.\"\nThere, and in most public appearances since, Ms Haley has cast her enduring campaign as an act of principle, a decision meant to give Republicans an alternative to Mr Trump or President Joe Biden - who she contends are \"the most disliked politicians in America\".\n\"There are 70% of Americans who don't want another Biden-Trump rematch and 60% of Americans who think Biden and Trump are both too old,\" one of Ms Haley's spokeswomen, Olivia Perez-Cubas said. \"They [voters] deserve a better choice.\"\nFriends and allies of Ms Haley have insisted that her public remarks are sincere, and that she is focused solely on this year's Republican nomination.\n\"When you talk to her in private, she says I'm sticking with this,\" said Jenny Sanford-McKay, South Carolina's former first lady and Ms Haley's friend. \"The opportunity for her is now.\"\nSome contend Ms Haley is continuing as a candidate in case Mr Trump, who faces numerous criminal and civil legal challenges, suddenly had to bow out of the race.\nBut Republican strategists have also raised another theory: perhaps Ms Haley is looking four years ahead, with an eye toward the next presidential election in 2028.\nIf that is the plan, Ms Haley's current campaign would provide her a significant head start, functioning as a nationwide rehearsal for her messaging and fundraising. Even as she trails Mr Trump, Ms Haley has assembled teams in at least a dozen states and planned a seven-figure ad buy ahead of Super Tuesday on 5 March, when Republicans in 16 states will vote.\n\"People will remember her, and that she was a solid candidate,\" Ron Bonjean, a political strategist, said.\nThe road ahead\nDeep-pocketed donors are helping her ongoing efforts by pouring millions of dollars into her campaign, with several saying publicly they see her as a competent counter to Mr Trump's chaos.\nIn January alone, campaign officials said Ms Haley raised $16.5m (\u00c2\u00a313m) - her largest monthly total.\nThat money seems to correlate with the energy on the ground. Almost in spite of the steady drum beat of bad polling, on the campaign trial this week Ms Haley appeared relaxed and upbeat, drawing out her tightly-rehearsed stump speeches with new riffs, laughing at her own jokes.\nThe voters in attendance seemed energised too, both about Ms Haley and about leaving Mr Trum",
    "The government has announced new measures to speed up compensation to victims of the Post Office scandal.\nAn interim payment of \u00c2\u00a3450,000 will be available to sub-postmasters who had convictions overturned, up from the current level of \u00c2\u00a3163,000.\nLegislation to clear wrongly convicted sub-postmasters is also expected to be brought forward next month.\nPost Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake said the steps were \"unprecedented, but the right thing to do\".\nAnnouncing the measures to MPs, Mr Hollinrake confirmed hundreds of people wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal would have interim compensation payments increase, once they had submitted a full claim.\nThe payments would be available to members of the Overturned Convictions Scheme and made while victims' final settlements are processed.\nMr Hollinrake confirmed those connected to another compensation scheme, the Group Litigation Order (GLO) Scheme, would now be able to get 80% of their offer paid out if they decided to fight on for a better deal.\nHe also told MPs that legislation aimed at exonerating wrongly convicted sub-postmasters is expected to be brought forward \"as soon as possible next month\".\nReacting to the announcement, Chris Hodges, chair of the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, said he anticipated the package would \"lead to much swifter payments and less hassle in many cases\".\nBetween 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software.\nIncorrect information provided by a computer system called Horizon, developed by Japanese firm Fujitsu, meant that sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted for stealing money.\nMany of those convicted went to prison for false accounting and theft. Many were financially ruined.\nSome sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died in the intervening years.\nSo far, 101 convictions have been overturned.\nThere is no single compensation scheme for sub-postmasters to apply to, and individual eligibility will depend on the particular circumstances of an individual's case.\nThe three main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal and include:\nVictims whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked \u00c2\u00a3600,000 settlement, or can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more. All eligible people are entitled to the \"interim\" payment, which the Post Office minister announced would increase.\nAs of 1 February 2024, approximately \u00c2\u00a3160m has been paid to over 2,700 claimants across the three schemes.\nWhen the government's promised law to overturn all convictions linked to the scandal becomes a reality, hundreds more people will be eligible.\nAddressing the Commons, Mr Hollinrake said the government had committed to provide offers on a fully completed claim within 40 working days in 90% of cases.\nHe added that serious consideration will be given to look at a third scheme - the Horizon Shortfall Scheme.\nAs well as requirements relating to people eligible for exoneration under the legislation, Mr Hollinrake said those affected would have to sign a statement to the effect that they did not commit the crime for which they were convicted before they could receive financial redress.\nIf they were subsequently found to have signed the statement falsely, Mr Hollinrake said they \"may be guilty of fraud\".\nHow have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "An Uzbekistan court has sentenced 23 people to prison over the deaths of 68 children linked to contaminated cough syrup.\nThe defendants were found guilty of tax evasion, sale of substandard or counterfeit medicines, abuse of office, negligence, forgery, and bribery.\nThe sentences range from two to 20 years.\nThe number of deaths announced at Tashkent City Court was higher than previously reported.\nSome 65 deaths were recorded at the start of the six-month trial, and prosecutors added three more last month.\nThe contaminated syrups were manufactured by Marion Biotech in India and distributed by Quramax Medical in Uzbekistan.\nThe longest sentence of 20 years was handed to Singh Raghvendra Pratar, an executive director at Quramax Medical.\nFormer senior officials who had been responsible for licensing imported medicine were also handed lengthy sentences, according to Reuters news agency.\nLast January, the World Health Organization (WHO) said two of Marion Biotech's cough syrups were \"substandard\" after 18 Uzbekistani children died from consuming them.\nThe WHO said the two syrups - Ambronol and Dok-1 Max - had unacceptable amounts of contaminants.\nMarion Biotech denied the allegations at the time and told the BBC it did not \"agree\" with the findings.\nProduction was then suspended by India's health ministry, and the company's licence was suspended by the food safety department in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where it was based.\nIn March, its manufacturing licences were \"permanently\" cancelled .\nThe court decided the families of the 68 children who died will each receive $80,000 (\u00c2\u00a363,000) in compensation.\nThe same sum will also be paid to the families of four children who became disabled after consuming the cough syrup.",

    "The UK has signed a new deal with the EU's border agency to work more closely together to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.\nThe agreement with Frontex is intended to lead to more sharing of information and expertise.\nIt is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving cooperation in tackling illegal migration.\nLast year, nearly 30,000 migrants crossed the Channel to the UK from France - down a third on 2022.\nHowever, the total was still the second highest figure on record.\nThe deal includes training for both the UK and EU's border agencies to learn from successful tactics overseas, collaboration on the development of new technologies, and the deployment of staff on both sides to help coordinate efforts to stop crossings.\nHome Secretary James Cleverly said: \"Organised immigration crime and people smuggling are global challenges that require shared solutions and ambitions.\n\"Our landmark working arrangement between the UK and Frontex is another crucial step in tackling illegal migration, securing our borders and stopping the boats.\"\nThe home secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the deal focused on making it easier to share information and work together on operations, rather than being about returning migrants to the countries they came from.\nHowever, he said the government was looking at signing returns agreements with more countries, following a deal with Albania which was reached in December 2022.\nLucy Moreton, from the ISU, a union representing border force staff, said that, by not including a returns agreement, the deal \"was not looking at the larger part of the migration issue\".\nShe told Today it also did not confirm the UK would regain access to the Eurodac database, which was lost after Brexit.\nThe database stores the fingerprints of asylum seekers and migrants who have entered a European country, which Ms Moreton said would help returns by proving individuals had rightful residence in other countries.\nThe agreement states that generally both the UK and the EU will cover their own costs for activities carried out under it. However, it says the UK will pay Frontex for certain activities, with the details to be decided in a separate agreement.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak made \"stopping the boats\" one of his five key priorities last year.\nSo far, 1,716 people have made the dangerous crossing this year, down from 2,720 in the same period in 2023.\nThe deal follows an agreement in May between Mr Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to strengthen cooperation between UK and EU border agencies in tackling small boat crossings.\nIn March, the UK also signed an agreement with France , which included paying almost \u00c2\u00a3500m over three years to fund extra law enforcement officers and a new detention centre in the country.",

    "Swale Borough Council has become the latest authority to call for the Household Support Fund to be extended beyond March.\nThe scheme, introduced to help the most vulnerable during the cost of living crisis, is due to end on 31 March.\nIn January Medway Council wrote to the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, calling for it to be extended beyond that date.\nThe government said it had increased benefits, pensions and local housing allowance.\nSwale Borough Council has written to the area's two Conservative MPs, Gordon Henderson and Helen Whately, urging them to join its campaign.\nSince the fund's launch in October 2021, \u00c2\u00a31.5m has been distributed to people and voluntary organisations across Swale, providing emergency food parcels, fuel vouchers and help with housing costs.\n'Great concern'\nCouncil leader Tim Gibson said: \"Many of the households who have accessed the fund have exhausted their options and are desperate and at serious risk of harm or escalating crisis.\n\"Without the household support fund these families, who are the most vulnerable in our community, will have very few options available to them and this is of great concern to us.\n\"The council is facing a budget gap of over \u00c2\u00a31.3m, and while we will still do our best to help those in need, sadly we won't be able to provide the level of support we have been if this fund ends.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"We have invested over \u00c2\u00a32 billion in the Household Support Fund with almost \u00c2\u00a3800 million already paid to families with children to help with the cost of living.\n\"The current Fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average \u00c2\u00a33,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance.\"\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "Joe Biden's doctor says he is \"fit for duty\" and \"no new concerns\" have been identified after the US president's annual medical examination.\nMr Biden, whose health has been under scrutiny ahead of November's presidential election, underwent the assessment on Wednesday.\nWhite House physician Dr Kevin O'Connor said that Mr Biden \"fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations\".\n\"Everything's great,\" Mr Biden said.\nThe 81-year-old president received the physical at a military hospital in Maryland and declared himself \"squared away\" after the appointment.\nHe said the results were \"nothing different than last year\" and quipped that the doctors \"think I look too young\".\nMr Biden, whose last physical was in February 2023 , is \"healthy\" and \"vigorous\" and \"continues to work out at least five days per week\", according to his doctor.\nIn a memo, Dr O'Connor noted the president continued to be treated for atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat) which he takes a blood thinner for, as well as gastroesophageal reflux and hyperlipidemia.\nGastroesophageal reflux causes Mr Biden to have to clear his throat frequently.\nMr Biden last summer began using a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine at night to tackle sleep apnea, the report noted.\nThe physician also found that the president suffers from a stiffened gait but it did not worsen from his last examination, besides \"possibly tighter hamstrings and calves\".\nAn \"extremely detailed neurologic exam\" found no evidence of a stroke or Parkinson's.\nMr Biden also underwent a routine skin cancer surveillance. The president \"had several localised, non-melanoma skin cancers removed\" before the start of his term in office, the memo added.\nThe president's health was thrust further into the spotlight earlier this month after a special counsel investigating Mr Biden for improperly storing classified documents suggested he was suffering from mental decline due to his age.\nThe 345-page report described him as \"a sympathetic, well meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\".\n\"My memory is fine,\" Mr Biden said in response . \"I am well-meaning. And am elderly. I know what the hell I'm doing. I put this country back on its feet.\"\nOpinion polls indicate the president's age is a concern for US voters ahead of November's White House election.",
    "The Post Office has hired investigators, including some ex-police, to look at its own staff's previous work investigating the Horizon scandal.\nThe new team will look at allegations against current and past employees involved in the prosecution of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.\nConcerns about conduct have been raised during an ongoing public inquiry.\nA spokesperson said it was aware of the human cost of the scandal.\nRelevant findings from the internal investigation could be passed on to authorities, including the police, or acted upon by the Post Office itself.\nA Post Office spokesperson said that it takes \"any allegations of wrongdoing extremely seriously and investigates through established procedures including the involvement of relevant authorities as appropriate\".\nThe Post Office scandal has been described as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.\nBetween 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software.\nIncorrect information provided by a computer system called Horizon, developed by Japanese firm Fujitsu, meant that sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted for stealing money.\nMany of those convicted went to prison for false accounting and theft. Many were financially ruined and some caught up in the scandal have since died or taken their own lives in the following years.\nAn ITV drama triggered renewed public interest in the matter and fresh government action.\nThe government recently confirmed it would clear the names of hundreds of people wrongly convicted under new legislation.\nThe law is expected to come into effect by the end of July and will apply to convictions in England and Wales.\nIt will apply to convictions meeting specific criteria and is expected to clear the majority of victims, while the public inquiry led by retired judge Sir Wyn Williams is ongoing.\nDuring the public hearings, several former sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have described their own experiences and feeling intimidated by investigators.\nOne ex-Post Office investigator recently denied he and colleagues behaved like \"mafia gangsters\" towards wrongly accused sub-postmasters.\nAs first reported by the Times , a new team has been put together to look into its own investigators who questioned and prosecuted the branch managers.\nThe newspaper reported that four former detectives are interviewing persecuted postmasters and mistresses, trying to learn about how they were treated by the Post Office employees who built cases against them.\n'Righting wrongs'\nA Post Office spokesperson said: \"We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and we are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible.\n\"We are looking at specific allegations that have been made during the public inquiry about both current and past employees who may have been involved with the prosecution of former postmasters or sought the repayment of shortfalls caused by previous versions of Horizon under old contracts that previously existed with postmasters.\"\nThe spokesperson said the firm had \"rightly\" been criticised for past investigation practices.\nThe new team will include experienced criminal investigators recruited to look at the quality of a number of past investigations due to some of the allegations coming up in the inquiry.\nThe spokesperson added that it was hoped as much information as possible would be shared with former postmasters.\nA bitter row broke out earlier this month between Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and Henry Staunton , the former Post Office chairman.\nHe said he had been told to stall compensation pay-outs but Ms Badenoch said the claim was \"completely false\".\nOn Sunday, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he \"probably should have said sorry earlier on\" in relation to his role in the Post Office scandal.\nSir Ed served as post office minister under the coalition government from 2010 to 2012, and has since apologised to victims.\nAsked why it took him so long to apologise, Sir Ed told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: \"I probably should have said sorry earlier on, but it is a huge scandal and our hearts go out to those hundreds of sub-postmasters and their families who were treated appallingly.\n\"The key thing now is to make sure that those exonerations happen quickly, that they get the compensation quickly and that they get to the truth with the inquiry.\"",

Once Suntory saw that members were not prepared to budge it returned to the bargaining table with an improved offer.\"\nRegional officer Mike Hobbs said the deal would provide \"much-needed support\" for workers during a difficult economic period.\nThe Lucozade and Ribena drinks brands were sold by GlaxoSmithKline to Japanese firm Suntory for \u00c2\u00a31.35bn in 2013.\nThe factory has a long history of producing soft drinks , with Lucozade dating back to 1927 and Ribena first going on sale in the 1930s.\nIt was featured in the BBC television show Inside the Factory in 2022 and Ribena celebrated its 85th anniversary in 2023.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "A once-rare type of dragonfly may have been aided by climate change, the Broads Authority has said.\nThe Norfolk Hawker went extinct from the Cambridgeshire Fens in 1893 and, prior to 2013, its breeding sites were in the east of Norfolk and Suffolk.\nAs average temperatures have risen, it has expanded beyond its former limits.\nSightings and egg-laying have been recorded in Lancashire, South Devon, Dorset and Sussex by the British Dragonfly Society .\nSince 1990, the initial spread in East Anglia was westwards from the Broads and southwards along the coastal marshes of Suffolk.\nThe population that grew around the southern edge of Norwich was helped by water quality improvements and habitat creation in areas of former gravel pits, such as at Whitlingham Broad.\nThe recent colonisation of Norfolk hawker in counties beyond Norfolk and Suffolk was most likely due to climate change, with habitat changes also playing a significant role, the Broads Authority said.\nBut Dr Pam Taylor from the British Dragonfly Society urged caution: \"Although the hawker's overall range has expanded greatly, there are still huge gaps in its current distribution.\n\"It will need to infill many of these gaps before the species is truly secure in this country and only time will tell whether it will succeed.\"\nThe British Dragonfly Society said it was concerned that ponds, streams and rivers are under threat of future drought and that dragonflies need these wetlands to survive.\nThe Broads Authority's environment policy adviser Andrea Kelly said: \"What appears to be good news about the spread of the Norfolk hawker and its potential relisting as no longer endangered, is in fact a call to action about the significant threats to its precious wetland habitat.\nWetland habitat in particular is under threat and several other species of dragonfly have not been lucky enough to increase their ranges, the wildlife charity said.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Rishi Sunak has warned of the dangers of polarisation and hatred in politics, after a fractious week in Westminster.\nHe was speaking after Tory MP Lee Anderson was suspended from his party for refusing to apologise for saying \"Islamists\" have \"got control\" of the Mayor of London.\nThe prime minister did not directly address the remarks, but talked about protests and the safety of MPs.\nLabour's Sir Keir Starmer called for Mr Sunak to \"get a grip\" of his party.\nAshfield MP Mr Anderson was criticised by both Labour and Tory MPs after he told GB News on Friday evening: \"I don't actually believe that these Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they've got control of Khan and they've got control of London... He's actually given our capital city away to his mates.\"\nMr Khan called Mr Anderson's comments \"Islamophobic, anti-Muslim and racist\" and criticised the prime minister and his Cabinet for what he called a \"deafening silence\" on the issue.\nAn hour later, a spokesman for the Tory party's chief whip Simon Hart confirmed that the whip had been removed from Mr Anderson \"following his refusal to apologise\" for his comments.\nRemoval of the whip means that Mr Anderson, who is also a GB News presenter, has been suspended from his party in Parliament and can no longer sit as a Conservative MP.\nFollowing his suspension Mr Anderson said he \"understood the difficult position\" he had put the prime minister in and said he would \"continue to support the government's efforts to call out extremism in all its forms - be that antisemitism or Islamophobia\".\nBut Mr Khan described the Conservative Party's decision as \"belated\" and sought to maintain pressure on the prime minister by saying his silence on the matter was \"tacit endorsement\".\nUntil January Mr Anderson served as one of the deputy chairmen of the Conservative Party, but he resigned so he could rebel against the government over the Rwanda vote.\nOn Saturday evening, Labour leader Sir Keir questioned the prime minister's judgement in appointing him to the role.\nHe said Mr Sunak needed to \"take on the extremists in his party\" and had a responsibility to \"stop this slide into ever more toxic rhetoric\".\nIn a statement, also on Saturday evening, Mr Sunak did not address Mr Anderson's words but warned of an \"explosion in prejudice and antisemitism\" since the attacks by Hamas on Israel on 7 October.\n\"The events of recent weeks are but the latest in an emerging pattern which should not be tolerated,\" the prime minister added.\nHe said legitimate protests had been \"hijacked by extremists\" and said elected representatives had been \"verbally threatened and physically, violently targeted\".\n\"And in Parliament this week a very dangerous signal was sent that this sort of intimidation works,\" he said.\nMr Sunak was speaking following a week which has seen a heightened tension in Westminster, with a row over a vote by MPs on a ceasefire in Gaza, and concerns for MPs' safety.\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said his controversial handling of a debate on Gaza was to ensure MPs' safety, while crossbench peer Lord Walney, the government's Independent Adviser on Political Violence and Disruption, has said MPs needed protecting from \"intimidation\" .\nThe Sunday Times has reported that three female MPs have been given bodyguards and chauffeur-driven cars due to concerns about their safety .",

In November Ofcom fined Royal Mail \u00c2\u00a35.6m for failing to meet its targets.\nUnder what is called the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK.\nYet former and current Royal Mail staff have told BBC Panorama that at times letters have been left behind in sorting offices, while parcels and tracked items are prioritised for delivery.\nOver the last two decades we have been sending fewer letters, while at the same time there has been big growth in parcels, largely due to the boom in online shopping. Parcel delivery is important for customers and represents a growing business opportunity.\nOne former Royal Mail area manager, who left recently and asked to speak anonymously, says he was so short-staffed that for weeks at a time he instructed postal staff to leave letters behind.\n\"You knew that you were letting customers down and there was no hiding from it,\" he says. Those decisions were taken in consultation with his managers, he adds.\nHe also says that senior management would have known that letters were being left behind while tracked items and some parcels went out because every delivery office in the country collects data daily on what is and isn't being delivered.\nHe says that data was collated and sent up the management chain to the top of the company. It was \"impossible\" that the top of Royal Mail didn't know this was happening as \"everyone all the way up the chain was reporting those failures, was saying this is what we're prioritising\".\nRoyal Mail says it is its job to ensure every letter and parcel is delivered on time because that is what customers have been promised.\n\"There are certain times of the year particularly, or where you've got resourcing issues like Christmas, where volumes double. And we can tell you that sometimes it's logistically necessary ",

    "The prime minister believed Lee Anderson's comments about Sadiq Khan were unacceptable because they conflated \"all Muslims with Islamist extremism\", Downing Street has said.\nThe former Tory deputy chairman was suspended from the party after refusing to apologise for saying \"Islamists\" had \"got control\" of the London mayor.\nThe PM's official spokesman said the language he used was \"wrong\".\nBut he added that Rishi Sunak did not believe Mr Anderson was racist.\n\"It's unacceptable obviously to conflate all Muslims with Islamist extremism or the extreme ideology of Islamism,\" he said.\n\"That's why the PM regarded those comments as wrong and unacceptable.\"\nDuring a discussion on GB News on Friday, Mr Anderson said: \"I don't actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they've got control of Khan and they've got control of London, and they've got control of Starmer as well.\"\nThe MP for Ashfield was suspended from the parliamentary party on Saturday after refusing to apologise, and now sits as an independent.\nSpeaking to BBC East Midlands Today, Mr Anderson said he stuck by the \"sentiment\" of his words but that he \"should have clarified his comments about the London mayor\".\nHe said he was angry about weekly protests \"causing mayhem\" in the capital city but that he should have \"broadened out\" his criticism to include how demonstrations by groups such as Black Lives Matter, Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion were policed.\nOn Monday, Mr Sunak said Mr Anderson was suspended because his comments were \"wrong\" and not acceptable.\nHowever, he has avoided calling them Islamophobic, prompting Labour to accuse the PM of being too \"weak\" to do so.\nHome Secretary James Cleverly joined calls for Mr Anderson to apologise on Monday, saying his comments were not \"accurate\" or \"fair\".\nHowever, Mr Anderson has also received support from some Conservative MPs, including Jacob Rees-Mogg.\nThe former minister said his comments were \"infelicitous\" but \"his concerns about Islamism are entirely legitimate\" and he should not have been suspended from the party.\nFormer Home Secretary Suella Braverman is also said to think his suspension is an overreaction.\nMr Anderson has acknowledged his words \"may have been clumsy\" but said apologising \"would be a sign of weakness\" as he believes he is right.\nIn an interview on Monday with GB News - who employ him as a broadcaster - he argued pro-Palestinian protests outside Parliament and threats to MPs showed Mr Khan had \"lost control of the city\".\nPressed over whether he would join the right-wing Reform UK party , the former Labour councillor declined to comment but said he had \"been on a political journey\".\n'No-go areas'\nMeanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Scully has apologised for suggesting parts of London and Birmingham are \"no-go areas\" .\nSpeaking to BBC Radio London on Monday he had called Mr Anderson's comments \"inflammatory\" and urged him to apologise.\nHowever, the former minister also said he could see what he was \"trying to drive at\", going on to say parts of Tower Hamlets in London and Sparkhill in Birmingham were \"no-go areas\".\nHis remarks were criticised by figures including the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, who called them \"nonsense slurs\".\nIn another interview with the station on Tuesday Mr Scully said he \"put his hands up\" for using language he \"regrets\".\n\"What I was trying to say, I thought I was being specific about but clearly not, is the fact that a lot of the conversation, and the vacuum that's allowed to then be filled by populists, is when prejudice builds up because of perception,\" he said.\n\"There are areas of this country where there are tiny, tiny groups of people that cause people to feel uncomfortable in particular areas.\n\"That might be a white gang, that might be a black gang, a Muslim gang, whatever, and that then tends to write off whole communities for some people.\"\nThe Sutton and Cheam MP described this line of thinking as \"totally inappropriate\".",

We feel there's very little from a licensing point of view.\n\"A lot of transport issues were dealt with at planning and that was approved unanimously.\".\nEarlier objections from Greater Manchester Police, council trading standards, seven councillors, and three residents had been withdrawn after revisions were made by Co-op Live\nHowever, 32 residents, two councillors, the council's public health team, ASM, and charity, the Music Venue Trust (MVT), maintained their opposition to the licence being granted.\nMr Donnelly also criticised MVT's objection claiming that was because Co-op Live had \"declined\" to sign up to a \u00c2\u00a31-per-ticket levy which funds the MVT's \"pipeline investment fund\" for grassroots venues.\nMVT's Niall Forde said this suggestion was \"inflammatory\" and \"entirely false\".\nHe said MVT had supported the opening of the \"23,500-seat auditorium bowl\" but took issue with the venue's \"ancillary spaces\" being allowed to stay open later into the night because of the impact on neighbouring residents and businesses.\nCo-op Live would take trade off smaller venues, he added.\nThe licensing hearing continues.\nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "A type of golf, popular more than a hundred years ago, is making a comeback thanks to golfers in Cornwall.\nHickory golf uses clubs where the shaft is made of hickory wood rather than modern metal.\nNow, Paul East, a member of Truro golf club has started to embrace the traditional sport.\nAs a result, the Cornwall Golf Union (CGU) has officially recognised hickory golf, giving the game the same standing as modern forms of the sport.\nMr East said it was the history and tradition of hickory golf that sparked his interest.\n\"I thought, this is the game for me, not just having the hickory clubs hanging on the wall, but actually playing with them.\n\"So for the last five years, I've only played hickory golf, I haven't touched a modern club since.\"\nMr East said he also feels it is important to look the part, and dresses in old-fashioned clothing.\n\"Hickory is a traditional game and it's not a bad idea to dress appropriately, which basically means plus fours.\n\"You don't have to, but it's the norm in this game\", he added.\nShaun Davies has been making hickory clubs since 1990, following in the footsteps of his grandfather.\nHe said: \"My grandfather started club making when he was 14.\n\"He was getting to retirement age with no one else to take it on - so here I am 34 years later still making clubs.\"\nMr Davies added: \"The sport is growing definitely - I can't see myself stopping my job.\"\n'Good idea'\nCornwall is the first county golf union in the UK to officially recognise hickory golf.\nMartin Edwards is president of the CGU and said: \"Golf's been played in Cornwall since 1889.\n\"We thought it was a good idea to get involved, and to go back to a traditional way of playing golf again.\"\nThe CGU has organised a hickory golf competition in Lostwithiel in August to promote the sport.\nBefore that, Great Britain and Ireland join forces to take on the Continent of Europe in a three-day hickory golf tournament at the Royal Blackheath Golf Club in July.\nMr East will be captaining the Great Britain side, hoping to showcase Cornwall's hickory Golf credentials on an international stage.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

    "The British Library used to be my unofficial office. Once I even argued that for writers, the British Library was the best aspect of living in London .\nBut the UK's national library now feels a bit like a throwback to pre-internet times. Books have to be ordered in person, using paper slips. Much of its digital content is inaccessible.\nThe problems trace back to a ransomware attack in October 2023, which paralysed IT systems.\nThe Russian hacker group Rhysida claimed responsibility, and demanded a ransom of 20 bitcoin (equivalent to \u00c2\u00a3600,000 at the time). After the British Library refused to pay up, and following an online auction of stolen data, the hackers leaked the nearly 600 GB of private information on the dark web.\nIt wasn't until January 2024 that the online catalogue became useable again , and even this was an incomplete version.\nThe organisation has prepared users for a lengthy recovery process, noting that it could take several months just to analyse the leaked data. The library has not specified a timeframe for further recovery, but outside observers believe that it could take a year .\nThe British Library declined to comment for this article.\nThe good news is that this is an unusually long timeframe for recovery from a cyber-attack. According to the data site Statista , from 2020 to mid-2022, the average amount of downtime following a ransomware attack in the US was 24 days.\nA UK government survey conducted in 2022-23 found that 88% of businesses and 84% of charities had been able to restore their operations within 24 hours of their most devastating cyber breach or attack.\nBut protracted recovery isn't unheard of. From identifying affected IT systems to decrypting servers, uninstalling non-functional applications, blocking connections, disabling accounts, and restoring uninfected backups, each step can create bottlenecks.\nTo some extent the longer-term recovery depends on the amount of rebuilding, or new system construction, an organisation does following a cyber-attack.\nFor the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), which was hit by a ransomware attack back in December 2020, this process is continuing today. \"SEPA made the decision to build back better from new rather than re-establish legacy systems,\" according to a spokesperson for the agency.\nThere are many variables determining the length of cyber-attack recovery. These include the type and number of systems affected, the quality and quantity of backups, the experience of IT staff, and the sophistication of both the attack and the initial response.\nFor instance, with the rise of cloud computing, it's become increasingly common for companies to use hypervisors, which basically generate digital versions (virtual machines) of physical computer systems.\nRansomeware attackers can encrypt the hypervisor - locking up multiple systems and programs in one go. It's a trend being seen by Mandiant, a cyber security firm that is now a subsidiary of Google Cloud.\nIn a situation where a hypervisor is running many programs critical to business operations, \"the impact is more significant and in some cases can actually impact the underlying infrastructure that the organisation would use to be able to get back up and running more quickly,\" says Kimberly Goody, the head of cyber crime analysis at Mandiant.\nThe size of the organisation could also be a factor. \"A larger organisation could take a longer time to recover because when you look at the staff to systems ratio, it could be much higher than a smaller organisation,\" Ms Goody says.\nIn the anomalous cases where recovery drags on into months or even years, one potential reason is that an organisation's \"backups might have been encrypted and they haven't been able to restore them,\" Ms Goody comments. For instance, it may be a painfully slow process to obtain a decryption key.\nEnsuring that backups are created and tested frequently is one way that organisations can make themselves more resilient to cyber attack.\nMore technology of business\nAnother is to avoid reliance on a single type of prevention. Just one reason that antivirus fails, Ms Goody says, is because \"today there is a whole underground marketplace\" where criminals can cheaply test out malware samples against different antivirus programmes. If they see that their malware isn't detected by a particular antivirus product, they can target an organisation with those weak defences.\nShoring up defences would include investing in cyber-security staff and tools. Ms Goody also offers some advice to organisations overwhelmed by the array of cyber-security products on the market. \"The only way to know how effective they are for you, and how relevant they're going to be for you and your team, is to test that in your own environment,\" she emphasises.\nEven well-prepared organisations may fall victim to cyber-attacks. In these cases, cyber-risk insurance can help to absorb financial losses. Ms Goody calls this \"a really valuable component of an organisatio",
    "Warwickshire County Council has asked a lawyer to look into complaints against three councillors accused of making offensive comments about children with special educational needs.\nThe councillors have faced calls to resign after a parent backlash over the remarks in a council meeting.\nThe comments included the claim some children were \"just really badly behaved\".\nThe three Conservative councillors have since apologised.\nThe county council launched an investigation in January after receiving hundreds of complaints about the comments by councillors Jeff Morgan, Brian Hammersley and Clare Golby.\nThe investigation was initially being handled by the council's monitoring officer, who deals with complaints about councillors' conduct.\nBut in an update on the process, the council said it had appointed an independent external investigator because of the volume of complaints.\nThe council said Anthony Collins, a law firm based in Birmingham, would carry out the investigation on its behalf.\nIt will be led by Claire Ward, a solicitor and an expert in council governance who previously served as acting deputy chief executive at Herefordshire Council.\nProcess update\nMs Ward will examine \"a representative sample\" of complaints and invite the three councillors to respond.\nThe solicitor will then produce three investigation reports, which will set out whether the councillors have breached the authority's code of conduct, and if so, propose any punishments if appropriate.\nOne possible punishment could be a formal statement of disapproval read out at a council meeting.\nCouncillors may be recommended to undertake training and development, but they would need to agree to this.\nIf the councillors do not agree with the report or the recommendations, the matter will be referred to a committee of councillors for consideration.\nThe council estimates it will take about 12 weeks to carry out the investigation and finalise the reports.\nThe three councillors have already been removed from the committee where they made the remarks, but the leader of Warwickshire County Council, Izzi Seccombe, has resisted calls to suspend them the Conservative group.\nMrs Seccombe has apologised on behalf of the council and said what happened was not characteristic of her administration.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

    "Proposals to crack down on spurious legal claims used to silence journalists and other critics have been backed by the government.\nStrategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, known as Slapps, are often used by rich individuals to stop the exposure of wrongdoing.\nThe new measures would allow judges to dismiss spurious claims before they go to trial.\nThey would also protect defendants from exorbitant legal costs.\nThe Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation Bill, which applies to England and Wales, was put forward by Labour MP and former minister Wayne David.\nSecuring the backing of the government for a private members' bill means it is more likely to become law.\nThe bill has passed its first Commons hurdle unopposed and will now face further scrutiny from MPs and peers.\nDuring the debate, Mr David said current measures did not go far enough and his proposals sought to \"protect freedom of expression for everyone\".\n\"Bullying tactics can include huge, threatening litigation costs and damages and all of the unbearable consequences such as bankruptcy, loss of homes and livelihoods, as well as the emotional distress that entails,\" he told MPs.\n\"All of this can cause huge hardship and psychological pressure. Sadly, many people are not able to withstand all of this. So many of the cases are like, if you like, David and Goliath, but it's as if David had no slingshot.\"\nThe bill builds on the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023, which focused on Slapps cases involving economic crime such as corruption and embezzlement.\nRecent high-profile cases have involved Russian oligarchs and allies of President Vladimir Putin, typically using defamation and privacy laws.\nHowever, research has found the practice is widening, including cases of Slapps being used by abusers to silence victims of sexual harassment and by landlords against tenants who complain about the condition of their home.\nThe new measures would address Slapps across all types of litigation, including sexual harassment.\nUnder the proposals, claimants would have to prove they were likely to succeed before a case went to trial.\nNormally the losing party in a case must pay all the costs, but the new rules would mean defendants would not have to pay the claimant's costs, unless directed otherwise by a judge.\nJustice Secretary Alex Chalk said: \"Free speech and the free press are lynchpins of our democracy, and to muzzle people in this way is chilling.\n\"We want people to feel confident standing up to the corrupt, knowing the law is firmly on their side.\"\nLabour is also supporting the bill, with shadow justice minister Kevin Brennan telling the Commons: \"It's a step forward in an ongoing effort to protect freedom of expression and ensure that those who seek to report on wrongdoing can do so without fear of retribution.\"",
    "Dozens of people have been shot dead at a mosque on the same day that a church was attacked, say the authorities in Burkina Faso.\nIt was during early-morning prayers on Sunday that the gunmen surrounded the mosque in Natiaboani town.\n\"The victims were all Muslims, most of them men,\" a local resident told the AFP news agency.\nMore than a third of Burkina Faso is currently under the control of insurgents.\nReports say the attackers were Islamist fighters who also targeted soldiers and a self-defence militia stationed locally that same day.\nLocal media describe (in French) a huge invasion by hundreds of machine gun-wielding insurgents on motorbikes.\nAl-Qaeda's Sahel branch said it had seized an army barracks in Natiaboani, but there is no independent confirmation of this. It made no mention of an attack on a mosque.\nUnverified reports on social media suggest the death toll from the mosque attack could be much higher than the count given by officials.\nNatiaboani is in Burkina Faso's troubled eastern region where multiple armed groups operate.\nThat same day, at least 15 worshippers were killed in an attack on a Catholic church during Sunday mass in Essakane in the north-east . A church official said suspected Islamist militants were to blame.\nNo link has been formally made between the two attacks, but Burkina Faso's privately owned L'Observateur Paalga newspaper has questioned whether they were part of a coordinated plot.\nAttacks on religious figures are not uncommon in Burkina Faso.\nA priest who was kidnapped from the northern town of Djibo five years ago is still missing.

    "By-elections are often colourful and chaotic but there has never been anything quite like the contest taking place in Rochdale right now.\nThe vote next Thursday - caused by the death of the town's widely respected Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd - should have been relatively straightforward for Sir Keir Starmer's party, riding high on the back of a string of by-election victories around the country.\nBut the entry into the race of maverick former MP and left-wing firebrand George Galloway - and the spectacular implosion of Labour's campaign - has thrown the contest wide open.\nMr Galloway is mainly targeting Rochdale's Muslim population, who make up about 30% of the electorate, many of whom are angry about what is happening in Gaza.\n\"The people of Gaza don't have a vote in this election, you do,\" reads one of his campaign leaflets.\nAt a meeting at the town's Kashmir Youth Project, he says that, if elected, he will \"enter the chamber of the House of Commons like a tornado\" and \"shake the walls for Gaza\".\nHe claims a victory for him in Rochdale, a small town near Manchester, will be noticed \"by the people in Gaza, by the people in Tel Aviv, but most importantly by the front benches in Parliament.\"\nLabour's candidate Azhar Ali, who had backed an immediate ceasefire in Gaza before Keir Starmer's calls this week for an \"immediate humanitarian ceasefire\" , was disowned by the party when a recording of him making allegedly antisemitic comments emerged, for which he apologised.\nLabour members in the town were ordered to stop campaigning for him - and the shutters came down on the party's campaign headquarters.\nBut Mr Ali is still officially Labour's candidate - that's how he will appear on the ballot paper this coming Thursday because it was legally too late to change. If he is elected, he will sit in the Commons as an independent MP.\nBut it was clear from speaking to voters in the rain-lashed town centre on Tuesday evening that some Labour supporters were either not aware of him being dropped by the party or did not care.\nPaul Walsh, a 56-year-old roofer, said he knew all about the controversy but he was still going to vote Labour anyway.\nRumours had been swirling that Mr Ali's supporters were still campaigning for him - although there was little evidence of this beyond some mocked up social media images depicting Keir Starmer as a clown.\nOn Thursday, Mr Ali broke cover to say that these images had nothing to do with him.\nIn a statement, he said that he had been \"a Labour supporter for more than 30 years and has Labour values\". He added that he was campaigning and standing to be Rochdale's MP and that Sir Tony was a friend and he \"wants to continue his good work\".\nLittle wonder some voters seem confused about who to back.\nWendy Fleming, who recently moved to Rochdale from Ireland, half-jokingly suggests that the Monster Raving Loony Party candidate Ravin Rodent Subortna seems to be the only one talking sense.\n\"That actually hurts my soul,\" she says. \"Voting is something I really do take seriously, always have done, but this time it's so difficult. It's really just going to be the best of a bad bunch.\"\nJust about everyone you speak to is fed up with the bad press Rochdale has received in recent years.\nThe town, in the foothills of the Pennines, has a proud history - it was the birthplace of the Cooperative movement and 1930s film legend Gracie Fields.\nBut it has recently become associated with child sexual exploitation and grooming - something that is an issue at the ballot box, with William Howarth standing as the Parents Against Grooming UK candidate.\nThe town centre has had a makeover, with a new shopping centre, and its Grade I listed town hall has just benefited from a \u00c2\u00a320m restoration. But social deprivation' , poor housing and crime are rife.\nGeorge Galloway is eager not to be seen as a single-issue campaigner and is promising to \"make Rochdale great again\".\nHe is calling for the local hospital's maternity ward to be re-opened - and has even promised to help save the local football club, Rochdale AFC, which is facing bankruptcy after being relegated from the Football League.\nMany young Muslim voters in the town have been energised by his campaign - both for its focus on Gaza and his promise to tackle the town's social ills.\nArea Shakeel, who is studying to be a mental health nurse and volunteers at a local soup kitchen, says: \"He's actually listened to our views and our opinions in a diverse community - you feel like you are being heard when you are speaking to him.\"\nBut the man who sees himself as Mr Galloway's main rival, the town's former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, accuses him of ignoring the majority of voters in the town, who, he says, are \"white, working people\".\nMr Danczuk, who was suspended by the Labour Party in 2015 for sending explicit messages to a 17-year-old girl, something he now dismisses as \"tabloid nonsense\", is standing for Reform UK.\nHe insists his \"old Labour values\" are perfectly in tune with Ref",

    "The bells at a church have chimed for the first time in three years following a long-awaited restoration project.\nThe bells at St Peter and St Mary's Church in Stowmarket, Suffolk, were removed for upgrades in 2019.\nThe restoration project, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, saw two more bells added and the installation of a steel frame.\nTower captain Winston Girling said: \"We now have a superb and well-tuned ring which will last for many years.\"\nThe revamp began in 2019, but the church said the bells' return was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"It was clear that the 1984 bell frame was unable to deal with the forces produced by swinging the bells in full circles,\" continued Mr Girling.\n\"The Parochial Church Council gave us permission to have the bells restored and we urgently started raising funds.\"\nWhen the timber frame was removed by the bell hangers, it became apparent that it had been compromised by deathwatch beetles - a woodboring beetle known for infesting timber in old buildings.\nMr Girling hoped the steel frame would last for \"at least a century\".\nThe new bells were rung for the first time during a dedication service on Sunday, which was attended by The Bishop of Dunwich, Dr Mike Harrison.\nDr Harrison said: \"Church bells are a rich part of England's social landscape - ringing out to mark celebrations such as weddings or coronations, sounding dolefully for funerals or national mourning, and more ordinarily simply calling people to worship on a Sunday morning and at other times.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "The House of Lords is being urged to throw out plans for non-doctor associate roles to be licensed by the same body as doctors.\nUnder a planned new law , physician associates (PAs) will be regulated by the General Medical Council (GMC).\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) believes this could lead to patients confusing the different roles, which it says could have \"tragic consequences\".\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.\nStephen Nash from The United Medical Associate Professionals, the trade union that represents physician associates,  said: \"This is an important day for physician associates. We are not doctors and never pretend to be, but regulation by the GMC would help better define the rigorous professional frameworks that we already work to. It would give patients, and other health professionals, confidence that we work to the highest of healthcare standards.\"\nThere are about 3,200 PAs working in GP surgeries and hospitals in England, with 10,000 more planned in the next decade or so.\nThey were introduced to help doctors with their work - examining and diagnosing patients and discussing treatments with them - although PAs are currently unregulated.\nUnlike doctors, they do not have to hold a medical degree, but they usually have a degree in a life science and have to undertake a two-year training course.\nPhysician associates 'not doctors'\nThe BMA, the union representing doctors in the UK, believes that regulation by the GMC could lead to a \"blurring of the lines\" between PAs and doctors.\nIn an open letter to the House of Lords ahead of a debate on Monday , the BMA's chairman Prof Phil Banfield said: \"PAs are not doctors. They do not hold a medical degree and are not medically trained, despite misleading statements made by some.\n\"We know that patients are already confused about telling the difference between PAs and doctors, and this legislation will make this problem worse.\n\"Keeping the GMC as the regulator exclusively of doctors would mean we retain the clear distinction between doctors and PAs.\"\nThe BMA believes PAs should instead be licensed by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), which regulates other medical professionals such as paramedics and radiographers. Like the GMC, the HCPC's function is to set standards, assure quality and investigate complaints.\nUnder the same order, anaesthesia associates (AAs) working in the NHS would also come under the regulation of the GMC. AAs help anaesthetists, and should be supervised.\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"Physician associates play an important role in supporting the NHS to provide high-quality care for patients, but this should always be with appropriate supervision and within the scope of their practice.\"",

His widow has blamed the Russian president for his death, as have many world leaders.\nFew details have been released on the cause of his death, and Russian authorities initially refused to hand Navalny's body over to his mother Lyudmila. They finally relented eight days after he died.\nOn Tuesday, Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said his team were struggling to find somewhere to hold the ceremony - some funeral homes had claimed they were fully booked, she said, while others had refused when they found out who the event was for.\n\"One place told us that funeral agencies were forbidden from working with us,\" Ms Yarmysh posted on social media.\nDetails of the funeral came as Ms Navalnaya addressed the European Parliament in Strasbourg.\nIn it, she condemned Russia's \"brutal and sneaky\" war in Ukraine, and said the West's strategy for taking on Russia has not worked.\n\"You can't hurt Putin with another resolution or another set of sanctions that is no different from the previous ones.\"\nInstead, she urged MEPs to take inspiration from her late husband, calling him \"an inventor\" who \"always had new ideas for everything, but especially for politics\".\n\"You have to stop being boring,\" she said.\nNavalny's team had originally wanted to hold the funeral on 29 February, but \"it quickly became clear that there was not a single person around who could dig a grave on that day\", Ivan Zhdanov, the director of Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, wrote on X.\nHe implied that the reason for this was because Mr Putin is due to make a major speech on the same day.\n\"The Kremlin understands that nobody will care for Putin and his address on the day of Alexei's farewell,\" Mr Zhdanov wrote.\nHe also encouraged people to arrive early \"to have a chance to say goodbye to Alexei\".\nA farewell ceremony will take place in the morning, followed by the funeral service at 14:00 (11:00 GMT) and the burial at 16:00 (13:00 GMT).\nSince Navalny's death at a notorious penal colony in the Arctic Circle on 16 February, some 400 people have been arrested across Russia after laying flowers for him, according to human rights group, OVO-Info.\nHis funeral on Friday is likely to be subject to a heavy police presence.\nEarlier this week, an ally of Navalny alleged he was about to be freed in a prisoner swap when he died - but that President Putin changed his mind at the last moment.\nThe Kremlin has said it was unaware of such a deal.\nAdditional reporting by Tiffany Wertheimer and Ben Tobias.\nAlexei Navalny: More coverage",
    "Tributes have flowed in for Australian TV personality Jesse Baird and his partner Luke Davies, as relatives visit the site where their bodies were found.\nPolice located human remains inside \"surf bags\" on a rural property in Bungonia, south of Sydney, on Tuesday.\nThe discovery ends a search that has gripped and horrified Australia.\nPolice officer Beaumont Lamarre-Condon has been charged with murdering the couple, allegedly with his work-issued gun. He is yet to enter a plea.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among those who paid tribute to Mr Baird and Mr Davies, offering condolences to their family and friends.\n\"They obviously were full of life... this is just a terrible incident,\" he said, adding that it was a \"tough day\" for the LGBT community.\nDozens of Mr Davies' friends held an intimate beach-side vigil in Sydney on Tuesday evening, lighting candles beside a portrait of the 29-year-old - who had recently landed his dream job as an international flight attendant for Qantas.\nIn tributes posted online, Mr Davies has been remembered as a beautiful soul with a \"lust for life\", a love of travel and a cheeky smile.\n\"I can't believe he's gone. What a tragic waste,\" his friend Rory Grant said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.\nMeanwhile Mr Baird - a TV personality and Australian Football League umpire - has been remembered by loved ones as a talented, effervescent, and caring man.\nHis cousin, Austin Baird, described the 26-year-old as his \"first ever best friend\".\n\"I am beyond devastated... you were one in a million,\" he wrote on Instagram.\nMr Baird's peers at Network 10 have said he was more friend than colleague. \"[He was] like a little brother. He had this big, beautiful smile [and] at 26 he was an absolute star,\" said Sarah Harris - the host of current affairs show the Project - in a teary on-air tribute on Sunday.\nPolice under scrutiny\nIn a series of press conferences this week, New South Wales (NSW) Police have shared a timeline of how they allege the killings of the Sydney couple unfolded.\nWitnesses have said they heard \"shouting\" from inside Mr Baird's inner-city Paddington home on the morning of 19 February. Around 09:50 local time (22:50 GMT), neighbours heard gunshots but did not report them to police until days later.\nWithin minutes of the gunshots, an emergency call was made from Mr Davies' phone but quickly disconnected. Police say they sent a patrol car to Paddington to investigate the source of the call, but they could not determine the location it had originated from and did not enter Mr Baird's home.\nTwo more days passed before the couple's bloodied items were found in a bin in Cronulla, 28km (17 miles) away.\nPolice set up a crime scene at Mr Baird's house last Wednesday after finding a \"significant\" amount of blood and upturned furniture, as well as a bullet, apparently from Mr Lamarre-Condon's work-issued gun.\nThey also appealed for information and searched a family home in Balmain.\nOn Friday, Mr Lamarre-Condon handed himself in. The former celebrity blogger - who once dated Mr Baird - was charged with two counts of murder.\nInvestigators allege he spent the days after the alleged killings crisscrossing the state to try and cover his tracks - enlisting the help of what police say were at least two unwitting acquaintances.\nIn the hours after the deaths, police say Mr Lamarre-Condon hired a van to dispose of the men's bodies, and that he sent messages from Mr Baird's phone telling his friends he was moving to Western Australia.\nDetectives began searching one property in Bungonia after allegedly learning Mr Lamarre-Condon had visited it, with a person they have described as an \"innocent agent\", last Wednesday.\nAfter severing a lock on a gate, Mr Lamarre-Condon then left the female acquaintance there before driving the van on to the property and returning 30 minutes later, investigators said.\nHe was initially unwilling to co-operate with police but finally told them on Tuesday that the remains were located at another property in the same town, according to authorities.\nNSW Police has come under fire for its handling of the case, with questions raised over the out-of-hours access officers have to their firearms and the vetting process for prospective recruits.\nThe police commissioner has also apologised after referring to the deaths as a \"crime of passion\" and using a Taylor Swift lyric to respond to criticisms of the force.\n\"There will always be haters, haters like to hate, isn't that what Taylor [Swift] says?\" Karen Webb said on Tuesday.\nPublic broadcaster ABC News reported Commissioner Webb on Wednesday as saying Mr Lamarre-Condon had been served with a \"show cause notice\" in prison, the first step in removing him from the police force.\nShe said an investigation was taking place and she was \"not aware\" as to whether Mr Lamarre-Condon had an approved firearm safe at his home, adding: \"Clearly, something's gone wrong.\"\nThe fallout led to NSW Police being uninvited from Sydney'",
    "A former senior police officer who is being investigated by the police watchdog has been appointed as a new county fire chief.\nNikki Watson will be the new chief fire officer for Northamptonshire.\nThe county's police, fire and crime panel appointed Ms Watson subject to \"completion of due diligence checks\".\nThe Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has renewed its opposition to her appointment and said local people had been \"failed\" by the panel.\nIn a report published on Thursday , West Northamptonshire Council officer James Edmunds said the panel \"generally commented\" that she \"could bring to it a range of relevant skills and experience\".\n\"This included significant experience of strategic leadership in emergency services and of working collaboratively with partners in that sector and beyond,\" he added.\n'Without substance'\nThe panel - which is made up mainly of councillors - met and discussed the appointment on Tuesday.\nThe county's police, fire and crime commissioner Stephen Mold told the panel that Ms Watson, the former deputy chief constable of Avon and Somerset Police, was his preferred candidate.\nHe said there was \"no criminal element\" to the complaint being investigated by the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC).\nThe IOPC matter was \"without substance\" and arose after she was chosen as the preferred candidate, Mr Mold continued.\nHowever, Mr Mold said Ms Watson would not be appointed into the role until the matter was resolved and the vetting was completed.\nA Conservative councillor on the panel, Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez de Savage, previously said he received more than 200 emails and phone calls from firefighters and the public opposing the choice.\nFBU executive council member for the East Midlands, Adam Taylor, said after the announcement: \"Councillors received a staggering 2,000 emails calling for the veto of this appointment.\n\"It's clear that the public stands with firefighters in expecting accountability and integrity.\"\nThe FBU has complained that she has no operational experience in firefighting.\nThe previous chief fire officer Mark Jones stepped down suddenly in July 2023 after a year in the post, and his successor Nicci Marzec left her interim chief officer post last July after only 10 days.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Anti-flea and tick treatments for dogs could be harming sensitive streams and ponds in the New Forest, conservationists have warned.\nA study by Wild New Forest and the Freshwater Habitats Trust showed high levels of imidacloprid, found in spot-on treatments, at four locations.\nPrevious research found it negatively affected insect species.\nThe New Forest Dog Owners Group (NFDOG) said owners should be made aware of less harmful alternative treatments.\nThe survey work was conducted in October at sites where dogs were known to enter the water to swim or splash.\nResearchers said one of the sites, Dibden Bottom, had levels of imidacloprid at nearly double the internationally agreed toxicity threshold for aquatic invertebrates.\nThe samples collected from Cadmans Pool, Green Pond, and Janesmoor Pond also contained imidacloprid, with the values at Janesmoor Pond being just below the toxicity threshold.\nImidacloprid is a highly toxic pesticide that is banned for use in outdoor agriculture, but continues to be widely used in pet flea treatments, typically applied to the back of the pet's neck - known as spot-ons.\nConservationists have raised concerns about its detrimental effect on insect life including dragonflies, mayfly larvae and damselflies, which are important components of the aquatic ecosystem, providing food for fish, birds, and bats.\nDr Naomi Ewald of Freshwater Habitats Trust said: \"These habitats also support our rarest freshwater species, which have disappeared from large swathes of the wider countryside.\n\"Keeping New Forest freshwaters clean and free from polluting agricultural nutrients and urban chemicals is a priority if these species are to survive and thrive.\"\nProf Russell Wynn of Wild New Forest said: \"Although there is growing awareness of the pervasive nature of these chemicals in English rivers, we suspect that most dog-walkers will be unaware of the potential impacts of allowing their dog to enter the water here in the New Forest.\n\"We hope that by collecting and openly sharing these data we can raise awareness amongst the community and start a positive discussion about less harmful alternatives\".\nVet Alex Crook, from the Pilgrims Vets clinic in Fordingbridge, said he was \"alarmed\" at the presence of imidacloprid in forest water courses.\nHe said dog owners were often unaware of advice over the use of treatments which was \"hidden in small print\".\n\"I urge people to keep their dogs out of water for the recommended time after application, depending on which product they use,\" he said.\n\"Or better still to use alternative products altogether, like tablets.\n\"For many years farmers have been doing their bit for the New Forest environment by avoiding the use of certain drugs in their livestock, and now we are asking dog owners to follow suit.\"\nHeather Gould of NFDOG said the findings were \"important\".\nShe said: \"It's essential that we protect our environment.\n\"It's also important though, that dog owners protect their pets. Vets are aware of the issue, and owners should discuss this before selecting which treatment to use.\"\nResearch carried out by the University of Sussex in 2021 found that imidacloprid was found in 66% of UK freshwater samples, and another neonicotinoid, fipronil, was detected in 98% of samples.\nFurther research published earlier this month showed that the toxic pesticides used in the flea products were washed into household drains when pet owners wash their hands after treating their animals.\nThe National Office of Animal Health, which represents the veterinary pharmaceuticals industry, said parasite control products were \"essential in helping pets live longer, healthier, and more active lives\".\n\"Decades of evidence around the world demonstrates the safety of these products when used according to label directions,\" it said.\n\"The quantities used in pet parasiticides cannot explain levels of the compounds detected in some waterways. These compounds have multiple other uses.\"\nThe government's Veterinary Medicines Directorate said the University of Sussex findings would be studied within the cross-government Pharmaceuticals in the Environment Group.\n\"It is important to highlight that there are several evidence gaps remaining, including the need to improve understanding of the impacts that flea and tick treatments have on aquatic ecosystems, animal health and human health.\"\nIt said all veterinary medicines \"undergo rigorous scientific assessment\" prior to approval, including an environmental exposure assessment.\nWild New Forest said it would carry out further survey work during the summer when water levels were lower and there was more recreational activity in the national park.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "Former Guinean opposition leader Mamadou Oury Bah has been appointed prime minister by the country's military junta, a week after it abruptly dissolved the government.\nHis appointment comes amid growing dissatisfaction with the junta.\nTwo people were killed on Monday after police clashed with protesters during a nationwide workers' strike.\nTrade unions have been demanding lower food prices as Guineans struggle with the high cost of living.\nMr Bah, popularly known in Guinea as Bah Oury, has urged the unions to call off the strike and \"highlight what we can do together to solve the big challenges gradually, step by step\".\nThe trained economist is expected to not only set up a new government to replace the one that was dismissed, but also take steps to alleviate the economic hardships facing millions of Guineans.\nThe swearing-in of the new prime minister was witnessed by interim President Mamady Doumbouya, who led Guinea's armed forces to overthrow elected President Alpha Cond\u00c3\u00a9 in September 2021.\nMr Bah, 65, has been a popular fixture in Guinean politics since the early 1990s.\nIn 1991, he founded the country's main opposition party, the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG), from which he was later expelled.\nHe went on to lead the Union of Democrats for the Rebirth of Guinea (UDRG) party.\nIn 2007, he was appointed minister of national reconciliation in a consensus government.\nMr Bah then spent four years exiled in France after he was implicated in a 2011 attack on President Cond\u00c3\u00a9's home, but returned home in 2016 after the president pardoned him.\nGuinea is expected to hold elections to restore democratic rule in 10 months, when the 24-month transition period set by the junta and regional bloc Ecowas expires.\nThe junta and opposition have been in a stalemate over the transition to civilian rule, but many Guineans hope that Mr Bah's political experience will be instrumental in resolving the political and economic crises.\nYou may also be interested in:",
    "More police forces are to join a trial scheme that uses AI to detect whether motorists are using mobile phones or not wearing seatbelts while driving.\nThe safety project started in 2021 as a partnership between Warwickshire Police and National Highways.\nNow 10 more forces in England are to use the technology mounted to a vehicle that takes multiple images of drivers.\nThe images are then passed to police for consideration on whether any action is to be taken against offenders.\nThe police forces taking part in the trial are Durham, Greater Manchester Police, Humberside, Staffordshire, West Mercia, Northamptonshire, Wiltshire, Norfolk, Thames Valley Police and Sussex.\nIn the scheme's earliest phase, which ran for three months, the monitoring vehicle was stationary at the side of the road while in use.\nNational Highways said the operation was being extended to learn more about the technology with a possible future roll-out nationwide.\nIt added there were plans for the technology to be fixed to gantries for the first time, giving an unobscured view of lanes.\nThe trial began on 19 February. It runs until March 2025.\nUnder the scheme, drivers would receive warning letters from the police reminding them that they face fines of up to \u00c2\u00a3500 for not wearing a seatbelt, with penalty points and potential \u00c2\u00a31,000 fines for those using a phone in a non hands-free capacity.\nMatt Staton, National Highways' head of national road-user safety, said: \"We know that distracted driving and not wearing seatbelts were key factors in a high number of incidents that resulted in people being killed or seriously injured.\n\"Working with our police partners we want to reduce such dangerous driving and reduce the risks posed to both the drivers and other people. We believe that using technology like this will make people seriously consider their driving behaviour.\"\nNational Highways is working with Acusensus which is behind the technology.\nGeoff Collins, Acusensus' UK general manager, added: \"We have found this technology really does change driver behaviour.\n\"In New South Wales (Australia), where we first used the technology, the number of mobile phone detections have dropped by a factor of six, from 1 in 82 drivers spotted holding a phone in 2019 to 1 in 478 drivers in 2021 and 1 in every 534 in 2023.\n\"We expect to deliver similarly dramatic results here in the UK.\"\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Plaid Cymru has backed a motion of no confidence in Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, over his handling of last week's vote on Gaza.\nThe group's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said the events \"brought to light a profound disregard for smaller parties in Westminster\".\nThe party's three MPs join the SNP and some Conservatives in calling for the Speaker to quit.\nIt means 86 MPs have now signed the motion of no confidence .\nLosing the support of another party at Westminster piles further pressure on Sir Lindsay.\nThe Speaker prompted anger from the SNP and Conservative MPs when he broke with convention last week to allow a vote on a Labour amendment to the SNP's motion calling for an immediate ceasefire.\nIt meant the SNP's motion, which was originally meant to be the focus of the debate, was not voted on.\nAs a result, some MPs walked out in protest and the debate descended into chaos.\nIn a letter to the Speaker, Ms Saville Roberts said the debate - which was designated an Opposition Day for the SNP to discuss topics of their choice - had been an opportunity for the party to present a motion \"unimpeded\".\n\"But their right - and indeed the whole House's right - to vote on the original motion was quashed with little warning,\" she said.\nMs Saville Roberts said she had written to Sir Lindsay at the end of last week urging him \"to outline how arrangements can be put in place to respect the role of smaller parties in the House, and to ensure that our voices can never again be disregarded as they were on Wednesday night\".\nHowever, she said after meeting with him on Monday, \"it was clear that no changes would be considered to protect the role of smaller parties or to safeguard a diversity of voices in Parliament\".\nMs Saville Roberts also criticised Sir Lindsay for rejecting the SNP's request for an emergency debate on Gaza this week, saying he had \"reneged\" on a previous promise.\nEarlier, the SNP accused the Speaker of \"effectively lying\" over the possibility of an emergency debate .\nSir Lindsay explained his decision by saying a ministerial statement on Gaza on Tuesday meant MPs already had an opportunity to discuss the issue.\nHowever, the SNP pointed out that last week he had offered the party an emergency debate, after apologising for his handling of the original vote.\nSir Lindsay had argued that allowing a vote on Labour's amendment meant MPs could express their views on the \"widest range of propositions\", helping to protect them from threats to their safety amid heightened scrutiny over their stance on the conflict.\nHowever, the decision meant Labour avoided a potentially damaging rebellion over whether it supported the SNP's ceasefire call, which went further by calling for an end to the \"collective punishment of the Palestinian people\".\nThis led to accusations, which have been denied by the party and Sir Lindsay, that Labour had put pressure on the Speaker over the decision.\nThe no confidence motion in Sir Lindsay is known as an \"early day motion\". Very few of these are debated and they are not binding but they allow MPs to show their support for an issue.",

We don't have that anymore.\"\nMs Williams said children had felt \"a feeling of not belonging\" since moving to the cabins.\nShe said she was \"in disbelief\" that people had been able to remain living on the same street as the school while the school had to be demolished.\n\"It's completely nonsensical that we're still in this situation five years on,\"  Ms Williams added.\nLast year, the council scrapped controversial plans for a new \"superschool\" in the area, which would have included the closure of Godre'r Graig, Alltwen and Llangiwg primary schools.\nUnder the plans, those schools would have been replaced with a new central school for 630 full-time pupils and 140 part-time nursery pupils near Cwmtawe Community School, in Pontardawe.\nCouncillor Emyr Wyn Williams described the situation as a \"nightmare\" and has called on the council to remove the tip instead.\n\"There is so much uncertainty for us as residents.

As long as it improves the facilities and it's spent properly then I don't have a problem with it.\n\"I'd say the issue would lie with people who travel to the park rather than local residents, who might have parking locally,\" he added.\n\"It'll probably create a problem at the weekends or bank holidays when people travel to use the facilities.\n\"They might tend to park outside the park and that will cause issues for the locals rather than the park itself.\"\nCharlotte Shannon Young from Killowen said the plan would work for her because she always came to Kilbroney Park, where she could still get in for free if she applied for the pass.\n\"I presume most people would do the same as me and go to the closest one,\" she said.\nHowever she emphasised that people should not be \"put off coming to the parks\" as for some \"it's all the outdoor space they have\".\nMs Young added that the change could result in visitors parking in the town or along the side of the road.\n\"That would probably be a bit of a danger because there's a primary school there and lots of kids playing,\" she said.\nWhat are the new charges?\nHow much visitors pay depends on whether or not they are residents of the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.\nHouseholds within the district are entitled to one parking permit for free entry into a park of their choice.\nBut they must choose only one of the four parks when they apply for permits.\nApplicants must produce photographic ID, like a driving licence when collecting their permit  from the car park office of the park they choose.\nDaily entry charges for residents and non-residents without a permit:\nCharges for council residents with season permits:\nNon-resident season permits:\nNewry, Mourne and Down Council said the revenue generated from the new parking permit scheme would be used for \"the ongoing development and maintenance of these award-winning parks\".\nIt said the four parks attracted \"a substantial number of visitors per annum and an increasing number of visitors from outside the district\".\nIt added that the sites played \"an increasingly important role in driving economic development through tourism and of supporting local communities and businesses\".\nThe permits will be in force until 31 March 2025 but the operation of the scheme will be reviewed in six months.\nAnalysis\nBy Cormac Campbell, BBC News NI south-east reporter\nThat Newry, Mourn",

The SEC said Mr Loudon purchased 46,450 shares of TravelCenters stock, without his wife's knowledge, before the deal was made public in February last year.\nFollowing the announcement, TravelCenters share price rose nearly 71% and Mr Loudon allegedly immediately sold all of his newly-bought shares for a profit, the SEC said.\nDivorce\nIn a complaint by the regulator, during deal negotiations between TravelCenters and BP in 2022, Mr Loudon, of Houston, Texas, and his wife worked in home offices within 20 feet of each other.\n\"As a result, they frequently overheard and witnessed each other's work-related conversations and video conferences.\" She also worked on the deal when the couple stayed in a \"small Airbnb\" in Rome, said the complaint.\nMr Loudon confessed to his wife about buying the TravelCenters shares after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority began asking questions about the BP deal and who was \"in the know\".\nAccording to the filing, he said he bought the stock because \"he wanted to make enough money so that she did not have to work long hours anymore\".\nHis wife - who was \"stunned by this revelation\" - reported the trading to her supervisor at BP.\nHer email and texts were reviewed by BP and it found no evidence that she knowingly leaked the information about the deal to her husband or knew he had bought the shares.\nBut \"BP nonetheless terminated her employment,\" said the filing.\nAccording to the regulator's complaint, Mr Loudon's wife moved out of the house and ceased all contact with him. In June, she initiated divorce proceedings.\n'Effective surveillance'\nIn a statement, the SEC said Mr Loudon did not deny the allegations and agreed to pay a penalty.\nHe also faces potential criminal charges and if convicted, could face a prison sentence.\nDuring the pandemic, when many employees were unable to work in the office, UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned about managing insider trading risks when working from home.\nWith working from home now cemented into many organisations working patterns, the FCA has said  the \"need for effective surveillance at all times\" remained critical.",

    "French citizens are being urged to report signs of Russian manipulation in advance of this year's Paris Olympics.\nA note from the domestic intelligence service DGSI has called on police to pass up even \"weak signals\" of apparent operations conducted by Russian agents.\nIt warned that Russian \"proxies\" could exploit sensitive issues to \"amplify dissensions\" in French society.\nSimilar disinformation operations have taken place in other European countries.\nAccording to the note - which was seen by news agency AFP - Russian intelligence has put in place \"alternative methods that mobilise networks of 'proxies' with the aim of conducting interference.\"\nMany of these 'proxies', it says, are members of Russian-speaking communities in Eastern Europe, some of whom may be visiting France for a short stay, others \"installed for a long time either legally or illegally\".\nThe template for these \"acts of interference\" in French society was the spraying of Stars of David on walls in Paris last October, shortly after Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel, killing at least 1,200 people.\nBut the note warns that the Russian campaign is aimed at \"amplifying dissensions and internal fractures in French society\" by focusing on any useful theme - from pension reform to \"denigrating the Olympic Games\".\nThe DGSI says that \"in the current geopolitical context, and as France prepares to host the Olympic Games,\" police must \"systematically\" raise the alert after any hint of Russian activity.\nFrench intelligence believes that the Stars of David operation was carried out by Russian-speaking Moldavians, under the direction of the FSB (the Russian state security agency).\nAccording to Le Monde newspaper, quoting another DGSI memorandum, the graffiti was part of a Europe-wide campaign \"to divide opinion and weaken governments\" launched by the FSB's Fifth Division, which has charge of international operations.\nOther disinformation operations - some also carried out by Moldavians - have taken place recently in Poland, Spain, Latvia and Germany, the memorandum says.\nThe warnings come as the French government steps up its rhetoric against Russia, with the clear aim of raising public awareness of the threat posed to France and other European nations.\nSpeaking at a European summit on Ukraine in Paris on Monday, President Macron for the first time raised the issue of sending ground troops to Ukraine, refusing to rule it out as a possibility. This idea was rebuffed the following day by his German counterpart Olaf Scholz and by Nato General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg.\nElys\u00c3\u00a9e officials warned over the weekend of growing \"Russian aggression\" in cyberspace, and of \"activism in the field of information\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 using methods which are both violent and very basic.\"\nThe officials cited a recent faked report - purporting to be on the international channel France 24 and spread on pro-Russian social media - that President Macron had cancelled a visit to Ukraine because of an assassination plot.\nA recent French government information campaign - entitled \"Russian Disinformation\" - also urges the public to raise the alert, stating that \"public denunciation is one of the main levers in the fight against information attacks.\"",
    "Ambiguous interview questions and application forms are keeping autistic people out of work, a report has found.\nWhile 53.6% of all disabled people are in work, only 30% of autistic people are, the latest official figures show .\nOne autistic person told BBC News having more tick-boxes in applications might help him to land an interview.\nThe government has urged employers to \"get behind\" all recommendations set out in Sir Robert Buckland's report on autism in the workplace.\nAutism is a developmental disability that affects how people perceive the world and interact with others. The Buckland review says there are around a million people with an autism diagnosis in the UK.\nAdam Murphy, from Cheltenham, says he is ready for a job after more than 20 years as a full-time carer for his son Ryan, who is autistic and has learning disabilities.\n'Frustrating' lack of support\nBut Mr Murphy, who is also autistic, has applied for six jobs since October with no success so far.\nHe has difficulty filling out forms so usually asks to talk through application questions with an employer over the phone instead - but says some workplaces refuse his request.\n\"Somebody gave me feedback and said: 'Well, we can't help everybody because all autistic people are different, and we can't put reasonable adjustments in place for everybody',\" Mr Murphy said.\nMr Murphy says having tick-boxes in applications instead of free-form text-boxes, and getting interview questions in advance, are among the other adjustments that would help him.\nHe describes the rejected requests for support as \"really frustrating\", adding: \"If we're not putting the basics into place to begin with to allow those autistic people to apply, then that's failing them.\"\nThe Buckland review said that for certain jobs, there was evidence that autistic staff could be more productive than neurotypical staff.\nThe report sets out how businesses and government can work together over the next five years. It lists 19 recommendations for both, including:\nThe Equality Act 2010 made it harder for employers to unfairly screen out disabled people and ensured there was a duty to make reasonable adjustments for people at a substantial disadvantage because of their disability - and some businesses are already championing autistic people in the workplace.\nSince opening in 2019, Cafe Track in Northampton has supported more than 120 autistic people into paid employment and work placements.\nEx-teacher Thomas Cliffe set up the social enterprise after feeling \"angered\" by the lack of employment prospects for autistic people.\nHe trains and supports businesses to help make their workplaces more accessible.\n\"It's not a nice thing to do to employ an autistic person - it's a good business choice,\" he says.\n'Adjustments help me feel safe at work'\nAlmost all of the staff at CubeLynx in central London - one of hundreds of firms that fed into the Buckland review - are autistic.\nOne of those is Darcey Isaacs, who has been given various reasonable adjustments to help her work: she works part-time on a very flexible schedule, has access to quiet rooms during the day and uses noise-cancelling headphones.\n\"Having reasonable adjustments can help me feel safe and valued, and contribute to the company,\" she says.\n\"I am more than just a woman with a disability.\"\nMs Isaacs says autistic people's unique needs, skills, strengths and weaknesses vary - \"just like neurotypical people\".\nDr James Cusack, chief executive of research charity, Autistica, said: \"To be their best and to ensure they can get the best out of their whole workforce, including autistic people, employers need to change the way that they recruit and support staff.\n\"This is not about reasonable adjustments for a small number of people - it's about changes that benefit everyone, because we all think and work differently.\"\nThe review was led by Sir Robert Buckland, who told BBC Breakfast that changing interview processes could help to identify those without an autism diagnosis who \"might not even think of themselves as neurodiverse\".\nHe added: \"There is no such thing as 'normal', I learnt that a long time ago as a parent bringing up an autistic youngster and I rejoice in that.\"\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "The German parliament has backed a new law to allow the recreational use of cannabis.\nUnder the law, over-18s in Germany will be allowed to possess substantial amounts of cannabis, but strict rules will make it difficult to buy the drug.\nSmoking cannabis in many public spaces will become legal from 1 April.\nPossession of up to 25g, equivalent to dozens of strong joints, is to be allowed in public spaces. In private homes the legal limit will be 50g.\nAlready police in some parts of Germany, such as Berlin, often turn a blind eye to smoking in public, although possession of the drug for recreational use is illegal and can be prosecuted. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\u00e2\u0080\u00a8Use of the drug among young people has been soaring for years despite the existing law, says Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, who is instigating the reforms.\nHe wants to undermine the black market, protect smokers from contaminated cannabis and cut revenue streams for organised crime gangs.\nBut legal cannabis cafes will not suddenly spring up all over the country.\nA ferocious debate about decriminalising cannabis has been raging for years in Germany, with doctors' groups expressing concerns for young people and conservatives saying that liberalisation will fuel drug use.\nAfter a stormy session on Friday in the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, the vote was eventually passed by 407 votes to 226.\nSimone Borchardt of the opposition conservative CDU told MPs that the government had gone ahead with its \"completely unnecessary, confused law\" regardless of warnings from doctors, police and psychotherapists.\nBut Mr Lauterbach said the current situation was no longer tenable: \"The number of consumers aged between 18 and 25 has doubled in the past 10 years.\"\nAfter the vote he said the law would \"dry out the black market\" and fix \"a failed drug policy\".\nAs so often in Germany, the law approved by MPs is complicated.\nSmoking cannabis in some areas, such as near schools and sports grounds, will still be illegal. Crucially, the market will be strictly regulated so buying the drug will not be easy.\nOriginal plans to allow licensed shops and pharmacies to sell cannabis have been scrapped over EU concerns that this could lead to a surge in drug exports.\nInstead, non-commercial members' clubs, dubbed \"cannabis social clubs\", will grow and distribute a limited amount of the drug.\nEach club will have an upper limit of 500 members, consuming cannabis onsite will not be allowed, and membership will only be available to German residents.\nGrowing your own cannabis will also be permitted, with up to three marijuana plants allowed per household.\nThis means that Germany could be in the paradoxical position of allowing possession of rather large amounts of the drug, while at the same time making it difficult to purchase.\nRegular smokers would benefit, but occasional users would struggle to buy it legally and tourists would be excluded. Critics say this will simply fuel the black market.\nOver the next few years, the government wants to assess the impact of the new law, and eventually introduce the licensed sale of cannabis.\nBut given how tortuous the debate has been so far, nothing is certain.\nMeanwhile, opposition conservatives say that if they get into government next year, they will scrap the law entirely. Germany is unlikely to become Europe's new Amsterdam anytime soon.\nLISTEN: Why is Thailand making cannabis illegal again?",
    "A Texas judge has ruled that a school district did not discriminate against a black high school student when it punished him over his dreadlocks.\nBarbers Hill Independent School District suspended Darryl George, 18, last August, saying his hairstyle violated its dress code.\nThe judge found the Houston-area school did not break a state law banning race-based bias on hair.\nAn attorney for the family said they plan to file an appeal.\nMeanwhile, the student will remain on suspension and removed from the school's regular classrooms.\nChambers County Judge Chap Cain III ruled in favour of the school district after about three hours of testimony on Thursday.\nMr George spoke of his \"anger, sadness, disappointment\" outside court after the decision.\nThe school district referred to its dress code, which says hair cannot be \"below the top of a T-shirt collar, below the eyebrows, or below the ear lobes when let down\".\nBut Mr George refused to cut his braided dreadlocks, with the family citing its cultural significance in the black community.\nLast year Texas passed the Crown Act, a state law designed to prohibit race-based discrimination against people based on their hairstyle.\nDarresha George, the student's mother, filed a complaint on her son's behalf, accusing the district of violating the newly passed law.\nThe school district filed its own lawsuit in September, asking the court to settle the matter, and Thursday's ruling was the outcome of that case.\nHowever, Barbers Hill High School's superintendent Dr Greg Poole defended the school's decision, saying that the Crown Act did not mention hair length specifically.\nSince the start of Mr George's past year at Barbers Hill High School, in August, he has been handed multiple disciplinary penalties for refusing to cut his hair.\nHe was removed from class and placed on in-school suspension, and later required to attend an off-campus programme.\n\"He has to sit on a stool for eight hours in a cubicle,\" his mother told the Associated Press in August.\n\"That's very uncomfortable. Every day he'd come home, he'd say his back hurts because he has to sit on a stool.\"\nBarbers Hill ISD has previously made news headlines over dress code conflicts with its black students.\nDe'Andre Arnold and Kaden Bradford were required to cut their dreadlocks in 2020, and the two students' families sued.\nIn that case, a federal judge ruled the district's hair policy was discriminatory.\nA federal version of the Crown Act passed in the House of Representatives in 2022, but did not pass in the Senate.",

    "\"I'm afraid the elephant that killed my father could come back to attack again,\" says 13-year-old Alna Joseph.\nOn 10 February, Ms Joseph was returning from morning prayers at her village church in Mananthavady town in the hilly Wayanad district of the southern Indian state of Kerala when she saw a vehicle carrying a bleeding man.\nWhen she reached home, she found out that it was the body of her father Ajeesh Joseph, a 42-year-old farmer, who had been trampled to death by a radio-collared wild elephant - the second such death in the district in three weeks.\nAs soon as the local hospital confirmed his death, protests erupted in the town. They were withdrawn only after the authorities announced a 1m-rupee ($12,067, \u00c2\u00a39,525) compensation for Joseph's family and a job for his widow.\nNeighbouring Karnataka state, to which the elephant belonged, also announced a compensation of 1.5m rupees.\nSix days later, another wild elephant killed Pakkam Vellachalil Paul, a 50-year-old employee of a state-owned eco-tourism project, while he was on duty in Pulpally town, about 24km (15 miles) away.\nSince then, Wayanad district - known for its dense forests - has witnessed massive protests as angry residents blame authorities for failing to protect them from wild animal attacks.\n\"We often see elephants roaming around when we go out,\" Ms Joseph says. \"Most of them don't attack us. But how do we distinguish them from the dangerous ones?\"\nLast week, the funeral procession for Paul turned violent as protesters sat with his body - his last rites were performed only after the intervention of local politicians and religious leaders.\nProtesters also placed the carcass of a calf killed by a tiger in the town on a forest department vehicle and booed local representatives.\nPolice accuse protesters of \"assaulting forest department employees, damaging a vehicle and stopping policemen from carrying out their duties\".\nOpposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, who represents the Wayanad constituency in parliament, rushed to the state on Sunday to meet the families of the animal attack victims.\nThe state government held an all-party meeting and promised to cover medical expenses of those affected by such attacks, while the forest department said it had issued orders to tranquillise the elephant that attacked Joseph.\nResidents say they want strong boundary walls, solar-powered fencing, elephant-proof trenches, early warning electronic systems, radio-collaring of all wild elephants and creation of wildlife corridors - all things that have been promised by the authorities in the past.\nThere is also growing resentment that the state's chief minister and forest minister have not visited the area since the attacks.\nMan-animal conflict is a major issue for Kerala, state Forest Minister AK Saseendran admits.\nKnown for its lush green landscape, the state covers only 1.2% of India's land area, but accounts for 2.3% of its forest cover.\nWayanad has 11,531sq km (1.1m hectares) under forest cover, which is 29.6% of the state's geographical area.\nResidents of the district say most of the electric fencing and trenches dug to protect them from animal intrusions are in ruins.\nMr Saseendran says habitat loss and climate change and its impact on the ecosystem have contributed to rising human-animal conflicts here.\n\"Most of the raids are by reclusive elderly elephants who are hurt while fighting with youngsters in a herd,\" the minister adds.\nAuthorities say they are installing 250 surveillance cameras to track animal intrusions in vulnerable areas of the district.\n\"We need to protect the lives of both humans and animals and ensure a healthy coexistence,\" Mr Saseendran told the BBC.\nThe authorities also say a higher population density exerts more pressure on forest resources from dependent communities.\nBut residents don't entirely agree and blame government policies for shrinking natural habitats that are forcing animals into residential areas.\nN Badusha, a 71-year-old farmer and environmental activist who lives near the district's Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary, says the area lies at the junction of wildlife reserves of three states.\n\"Traditional farmers like me and the tribespeople lived here harmoniously for years,\" he says.\nBut decades of bamboo extraction from areas that the elephants relied on for sustenance have destroyed their food source, he says, adding that the government's push for monoculture plantations such as teak, sandalwood, mahogany, acacia and eucalyptus has also affected the movement of wild animals.\n\"Today, around 36,000 of 96,000 hectares of Wayanad forests are monoculture plantations such as eucalyptus,\" Mr Badusha says.\n\"The pristine and precious green spaces, vast swamps and wetlands are depleting,\" he explains, pushing wild animals, such as elephants onto farmlands and residential areas.\nResidents say the district's burgeoning tourism industry, cattle grazing, invasive plants and forest fires are also destroying wildlife habitats in the r",
    "A police force was explicitly warned of a double murder by one victim days in advance, an official chronology obtained by the BBC shows.\nKatie Higton and Steven Harnett were stabbed to death by Ms Higton's ex-partner Marcus Osborne at her home in Huddersfield on 15 May 2023.\nFour days earlier, Ms Higton told West Yorkshire Police she feared Osborne would \"seriously hurt or kill\" her.\nThe force says \"thorough reviews of the offences are being carried out\".\nThe murder was reported at the very moment professionals were holding an urgent meeting to discuss the fears raised by Ms Higton, 27, and how to protect her and her four children.\nOsborne, 34, has pleaded guilty to murder and other offences and is due to be sentenced at Leeds Crown Court.\nThe hearing comes a week after BBC Two's Newsnight reported that mothers of murder and manslaughter victims had accused West Yorkshire Police of failing to protect their children who had sought the force's help.\nNewsnight's report said nine women in total had raised fears for their safety - and it can now be revealed that one of them was Ms Higton. Last week, in response to Newsnight, the force said it had since \"implemented recommendations\" and provided training to staff.\nBecause of Osborne's guilty plea, there has been no criminal trial. The detail of events leading up to the murder of Ms Higton and Mr Harnett can only be reported because the BBC obtained the official chronology.\nThe BBC has been through several court hearings, including the High Court, to be able to report this information.\nProf Jane Monckton Smith, a criminologist and expert in domestic homicide, said when she first saw the chronology: \"The hairs on my neck stood up.\"\nEven with the limited information available, she said she could see that Osborne \"ticked every box\" as an imminent domestic homicide risk because he had a history of coercive controlling behaviour and domestic violence, and had made specific threats.\n'Kill us both'\nFriends described Ms Higton as \"bubbly\", \"fun\" and a \"great mum\" to her four children.\nShe had been in a relationship with Osborne for several years, but left him in late April 2023.\nOn 10 May 2023, Ms Higton made a report to police - but when she attended Huddersfield police station that day, no officers were available to see her, the prosecution told Osborne's sentencing hearing.\nOn 11 May, she went to make a formal statement to West Yorkshire Police at the local station in Huddersfield. She told officers that on the previous day, she had spoken to Osborne and he had refused to accept they had broken up for good.\nMs Higton reported to the police that Osborne had hurt her and said he would \"slit mine and the children's throats\" if she told anyone \"what he was like\", according to the chronology. She felt he would \"look for me and seriously hurt or kill me\" if she did not go back to him.\nOsborne had been jailed for violent offences against previous partners. Ms Higton herself had been the victim of abuse in a previous relationship.\nShe told police that Osborne had warned that if she got another boyfriend, \"he will kill us both\".\nProf Monckton Smith has drawn up a \"homicide timeline\" based on her research into cases of domestic violence. She said Osborne was at \"stage seven\" of the timeline - the step before murder.\nAfter reading about the case, she said: \"I was horrified and deeply, deeply sad that all the signs were there.\"\nThe day after Ms Higton went to the police, on Friday 12 May, a social worker from Kirklees Council contacted her to offer \"services\" which she declined, the chronology shows. It is not stated what services these were - she might have been offered a place in a refuge, for instance.\nMs Higton agreed that she and the children would spend the weekend with relatives.\nPolice then arrested Osborne but released him shortly afterwards. He was served with a domestic violence protection notice, which meant he was not permitted to contact Ms Higton directly or indirectly or attend certain addresses and would be arrested if he breached these conditions.\nProf Monckton Smith said that in such circumstances, a domestic violence protection notice can escalate the risk instead of reducing it.\nShe believes police should have sought to detain Osborne, rather than arresting and releasing him. She also argues police need more powers to detain people who are \"quite uniquely dangerous\".\nThe following day, Sunday 14 May, Ms Higton went to the cinema with Mr Harnett, 25, whom she had recently met. She posted a photo of herself on social media.

In 2009, Georgia withdrew from the contest after their proposed entry - We Don't Wanna Put In - was rejected for its obvious references to the Russian president.\nIn a statement regarding Israel's 2024 entry, organisers said: \"The EBU is currently in the process of scrutinizing the lyrics, a process which is confidential between the EBU and the broadcaster until a final decision has been taken.\n\"If a song is deemed unacceptable for any reason, broadcasters are then given the opportunity to submit a new song or new lyrics.\"\nHowever, Israel's public broadcaster, KAN, said it would reject any request to alter the lyrics.\n\"It should be noted that as far as the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation is concerned there is no intention to replace the song.\"\n\"This means that if it is not approved by the European Broadcasting Union, Israel will not be able to participate in the competition, which will take place in Sweden next May.\"\n'Scandalous' decision\nKAN also confirmed that the leaked lyrics for October Rain were accurate, and published them in full on its website on Wednesday.\nDescribed as a \"moving and powerful ballad\" the song is based around the refrain \"I'm still wet from this October rain\".\nIn the verse, Golan sings: \"Who told you boys don't cry/ Hours and hours/ And flowers/ Life is not a game for the cowards.\"\nThe reference to flowers is significant, according to Israel Hayom, as it is military slang for war fatalities.\nThe song then ends in Hebrew: \"There's no air left to breathe/ There's no place/ No me, from day to day.\"\nKAN said that Israel's culture minister Miki Zohar had contacted the President of the EBU to request that the panel approve the song.\n\"In his letter, the minister wrote that Israel is in one of its most complex periods, and that this fact cannot be ignored when choosing a song to represent it,\" the broadcaster reported.\nWriting on X, Mr Zohar said it would be \"scandalous\" to disqualify the song.\n\"The song of Israel, which will be performed by Eden Golan, is a moving song, which expresses the feelings of the people and the country these days, and is not political,\" he added.\n\"We all hope that Eurovision will remain a musical and cultural event and not a political arena - where the participating countries can bring their uniqueness and nationalism to the stage through music.\n\"I call on the European Broadcasting Union to continue to act professionally and neutrally, and not to let politics affect art.\"\nCalls for disqualification\nSeparately, musicians from other countries that participate in Eurovision have called for Israel to be suspended over the war in Gaza.\nIn December, Iceland's Association of Composers and Lyricists published a statement saying Israel's military action made its participation incompatible with an event \"characterised by joy and optimism\".\nSimilar protests have been raised in Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, with several pointing out that Russia has been disqualified since its invasion of Ukraine two years ago.\nSo far, Eurovision organisers have resisted calls for Israel's exclusion, saying the situations in Ukraine and Gaza are different.\n\"Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and, as a non-political media organization, not ours to make,\" Noel Curran, the director general of the European Broadcasting Union said in a statement.\n\"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East,\" he said. However, he added, Eurovision was \"not a contest between governments\".\n\"The EBU is aligned with other international organizations, including sports unions and federations and other international bodies, that have similarly maintained their inclusive stance towards Israeli participants in major competitions at this time,\" the statement concluded.",

Or you may be ejecting patients from Muckamore with undue haste, without appropriate care and provision for their resettlement.\"\nHusband and wife Mark and Marjorie Sharp were also at the meeting.\nTheir daughter Laura was in Muckamore for nearly 18 years. She has been in supported living since 2018.\nMrs Sharp said she was concerned that if her daughter were to require services for her mental health, there could be nowhere for her to go.\n\"At the moment we're looking for services for our daughter in the community, which we cannot get,\" she said.\n\"I have no confidence that there's going to be somewhere suitable. I have no confidence whatsoever.\"\nThe trust said in a statement that it was \"fully committed to supporting those patients and families as they move to new homes in the community\" and that it would do its utmost \"to ensure the transition is as seamless as possible\".\n\"We understand that the closure of Muckamore will be a cause of concern for families and therefore are making every effort to engage with families, carers, staff and special interest groups to discuss the future service model,\" the statement added.\n\"Belfast Trust would like to thank families and carers for engaging in this process.\"",

    "On a rainy Tuesday afternoon, Yejin is cooking lunch for her friends at her apartment, where she lives alone on the outskirts of Seoul, happily single.\nWhile they eat, one of them pulls up a well-worn meme of a cartoon dinosaur on her phone. \"Be careful,\" the dinosaur says. \"Don't let yourself become extinct like us.\"\nThe women all laugh.\n\"It's funny, but it's dark, because we know we could be causing our own extinction,\" says Yejin, a 30-year-old television producer.\nNeither she, nor any of her friends, are planning on having children. They are part of a growing community of women choosing the child-free life.\nSouth Korea has the lowest birth rate in the world, and it continues to plummet, beating its own staggeringly low record year after year.\nFigures released on Wednesday show it fell by another 8% in 2023 to 0.72.\nThis refers to the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime. For a population to hold steady, that number should be 2.1.\nIf this trend continues, Korea's population is estimated to halve by the year 2100.\nA 'national emergency'\nGlobally, developed countries are seeing birth rates fall, but none in such an extreme way as South Korea.\nIts projections are grim.\nIn 50 years time, the number of working age people will have halved, the pool eligible to take part in the country's mandatory military service will have shrunk by 58%, and nearly half the population will be older than 65 .\nThis bodes so badly for the country's economy, pension pot, and security that politicians have declared it \"a national emergency\".\nFor nearly 20 years, successive governments have thrown money at the problem - 379.8 trillion KRW ($286bn; \u00c2\u00a3226bn) to be exact .\nCouples who have children are showered with cash, from monthly handouts to subsidised housing and free taxis. Hospital bills and even IVF treatments are covered, though only for those who are married.\nSuch financial incentives have not worked, leading politicians to brainstorm more \"creative\" solutions, like hiring nannies from South East Asia and paying them below minimum wage, and exempting men from serving in the military service if they have three children before turning 30.\nUnsurprisingly, policymakers have been accused of not listening to young people - especially women - about their needs. And so, over the past year we have travelled around the country, speaking to women to understand the reasons behind their decision not to have children.\nWhen Yejin decided to live alone in her mid-20s, she defied social norms - in Korea, single living is largely considered a temporary phase in one's life.\nThen five years ago, she decided not to get married, and not to have children.\n\"It's hard to find a dateable man in Korea - one who will share the chores and the childcare equally,\" she tells me, \"And women who have babies alone are not judged kindly.\"\nIn 2022, only 2% of births in South Korea occurred outside of marriage.\n'A perpetual cycle of work'\nInstead, Yejin has chosen to focus on her career in television, which, she argues, doesn't allow her enough time to raise a child anyway. Korean work hours are notoriously long.\nYejin works a traditional 9-6 job (the Korean equivalent of a 9-5) but says she usually doesn't leave the office until 8pm and there is overtime on top of that. Once she gets home, she only has time to clean the house or exercise before bed.\n\"I love my job, it brings me so much fulfilment,\" she says. \"But working in Korea is hard, you're stuck in a perpetual cycle of work.\"\nYejin says there is also pressure to study in her spare time, to get better at her job: \"Koreans have this mindset that if you don't continuously work on self-improvement, you're going to get left behind, and become a failure. This fear makes us work twice as hard.\"\n\"Sometimes at the weekends I go and get an IV drip, just to get enough energy to go back to work on Monday,\" she adds casually, as if this were a fairly normal weekend activity.\nShe also shares the same fear of every woman I spoke to - that if she were to take time off to have a child, she might not be able to return to work.\n\"There is an implicit pressure from companies that when we have children, we must leave our jobs,\" she says. She has watched it happen to her sister and her two favourite news presenters.\n'I know too much'\nOne 28-year-old woman, who worked in HR, said she'd seen people who were forced to leave their jobs or who were passed over for promotions after taking maternity leave, which had been enough to convince her never to have a baby.\nBoth men and women are entitled to a year's leave during the first eight years of their child's life. But in 2022, only 7% of new fathers used some of their leave , compared to 70% of new mothers.\nKorean women are the most highly educated of those in OECD countries, and yet the country has the worst gender pay gap and a higher-than-average proportion of women out of work compared to men.\nResearchers say this proves they are being presented with a t",

    "\"It is hard to move on with our lives, and my life will never be the same again.\"\nThose were the words of Samantha Gossett after the sentencing of a man for killing her mother, brother, sister and her niece in County Fermanagh six years ago.\nDaniel Sebastian Allen will spend at least 29 years in prison.\nIt is one of the longest sentences handed down in Northern Ireland in recent years.\nThe bodies of Denise Gossett, 45, her son Roman, 16, daughter Sabrina, 19, and Sabrina's 15-month-old daughter Morgana Quinn were found in a burnt out cottage in Derrylin.\nHarrowing details were revealed in court for the first time but the full story of what happened may never be known.\n'Total control over the family'\nOn the morning of 27 February 2018, people in Derrylin saw smoke and flames from a burning bungalow on the hillside above the town.\nFew in the community knew the people who lived there.\nThey had rented the property on Doon Road for 14 months but rarely went outside.\nThe teenagers did not go to school or college.\nNo outsiders were allowed into the house, including the driver who delivered their groceries to the door.\nThose who did encounter them did not even know their real names.\nDaniel Allen called himself Samuel Quinn. Denise was also known as Crystal. Roman was introduced as Edward.\nOne neighbour described Allen as having \"total control over the family\".\nHarrowing scene\nThey lived what was described as an itinerant existence and told people they were trying to flee Denise's ex-husband.\nIt was more likely they were avoiding social services as they did not want Morgana taken into care, the court heard .\nSocial services in Northern Ireland only became aware of their presence in February 2018, just days before the killings.\nSpeaking at the time, their landlord Tommy Fee described how he and his neighbours tried desperately to save those inside the burning bungalow.\nHe only found out from the court proceedings that three of the victims were already dead before the fire was started.\nThe scene he encountered was harrowing.\nAmid the smoke and flames, Allen was standing outside the front door, shouting: \"Don't go in there.\"\nHe asked him if anyone was inside and he replied: \"Gone, gone.\"\nAs burning roof tiles fell on him, Allen refused to move, rocking back and forth trembling.\n\"I'm sorry,\" he repeated.\n\"They're all gone.\"\nWhen police arrived, Allen admitted that he had started the fire.\n\"A promise is a promise,\" he said.\n\"I promised to put them to the next life as they didn't want to stay here no more.\"\n'Dangerous and disturbing'\nThe fire was so intense that at first the police were unable to establish how many people were inside.\nIt had been started with strips of fabric soaked in heating oil left throughout the house.\nAllen told officers he was a paranoid schizophrenic, but he has never been diagnosed with the condition.\nThe delay of six years in bringing legal proceedings to a conclusion was to allow psychiatric reports to be completed.\nHowever, none supported a defence of diminished responsibility and the judge said that at most they described Allen as having a personality disorder.\nIn his sentencing remarks, the judge said Allen had a \"dangerous and disturbing\" character.\nAllen initially lived with the family in Scotland, before they moved to Ireland, first to Tralee and then to Cavan before their arrival in Derrylin.\nAllen's defence barrister described how he came from England to Northern Ireland to be sentenced for murder as \"a sorry tale\".\nOriginally from the Midlands area of England, he lived with his mother and brother after his parents split up.\nAt the age of 12, he ran away to live with his grandparents in Bristol due to issues at home.\nHe was said to have had no social life or friends and developed relationships with women on the internet.\nIn April 2015, he was sentenced to four months in prison in Ipswich for threatening to kill a former partner who accused him of rape.\nHe absconded, a bench warrant was issued, and he disappeared to Scotland.\nIn the months before the fire, Allen was in contact with a woman in the United States whom he met through the online game World of Warcraft.\nSuicide pact\nIn December 2017, he told her that his relationship with Denise Gossett had broken down and he talked about moving to America.\nHis barrister raised the question if this was the motivation for the killings.\nThe truth is we do not know and more than likely we never will.\nIt was \"an impossible exercise to establish evidentially what happened\" the lawyer said, and the only person who could offer an explanation was \"utterly unreliable\".\nAllen's claims of a suicide pact with Denise were accepted by the prosecution, although they described his version of events as \"false\" and \"implausible\".\nHe said Sabrina had killed her own brother and daughter, and that he had strangled Sabrina.\nHe gave an inconsistent account of why Denise and Sabrina's blood was on his clothing as well as the handcuffs attached to Denise's body.\nThe j",
    "A multimedia campaign featuring the voices of children will remind parents in England of the serious risks of diseases like measles if vaccinations are missed.\nHealth officials said they wanted to target busy parents with a message that \"stops them scrolling\".\nMeasles cases have been rising since late last year with clusters in a number of regions, including London.\nA steady fall in uptake of childhood jabs since the pandemic is to blame.\nMeasles is one of the most infectious diseases known to humans and when vaccination rates go down, it is most likely to spread quickly.\nAlthough it normally clears up with within 10 days, complications can be nasty and include blindness, seizures and meningitis. In some cases it can also kill.\nIn the campaign by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which launches on Monday, parents are being urged to make sure their children have had two doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and check they are up to date with all other jabs.\nIn a video which will run on TV, radio and online, children tell their parents and carers: \"If we're not vaccinated, we're not protected.\"\nThe campaign will be supported by trusted community leaders engaging with parents in inner-city areas, which are a particular concern, and have information leaflets in different languages.\nThe MMR vaccine is very effective at protecting against measles, but only 85% of children starting primary school in the UK have had both jabs - well below the target of 95% needed to stop it spreading.\nOther vaccines, including whooping cough, measles, mumps and rubella, polio, meningitis and diphtheria, have also seen declines in uptake, meaning levels of population immunity are no longer high enough to prevent outbreaks, UKHSA said.\nProf Dame Jenny Harries, head of UKHSA, said: \"While the majority of the country is protected, there are still high numbers of children in some areas that continue to be unprotected from preventable diseases.\n\"It is not just their own health that can suffer, but other unvaccinated people around them such as school friends, family and those in their community could also experience serious infections.\"\nDame Jenny warned that unless uptake improves, diseases that the vaccines protect against could start to re-emerge and cause more serious illness.\nMany other countries have also seen the same fall-off in vaccinations among children, and the World Health Organization recently warned of the growing threat of measles.\nIncident Room: Measles Outbreak: Why now?\nHealth experts examine why the virus is back and what can be done to get rid of it?\nWatch now on iPlayer\nHealth officials in England have already started contacting more than four million parents, carers and young adults to tell them they or their children have missed out on one or both doses of MMR jab. Anyone under the age of 25 can now have one by contacting their GP surgery.\nThere have been 650 confirmed measles cases in England since the start of October - nearly twice the total for the whole of 2023.\nIn the four weeks since 29 January, there have been 183 cases - with 69 of those reported in the most recent week, latest figures show.\nThe West Midlands accounted for 43% of cases during the last month, with most occurring in Birmingham, although health officials say cases in that region now appear to be stabilising.\nMeasles has affected other regions of England in February:\nMany of the infections have been in children and young people.\nWhat is measles and what are the symptoms?\nMeasles is caused by a virus that is spread by coughs and sneezes.\nCommon symptoms include:\nSmall white spots may appear inside the mouth.\nA blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically on the face and behind the ears, before spreading to the rest of the body. It can be harder to see on brown and black skin.\nYou can catch it at any age if you have not been vaccinated.\nThe measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is given in two doses - the first around the age of one and the second when a child is about three years and four months old.",

However, he was best known for the tower, which was designed to show off France's modern industrial prowess on a world stage, as the centrepiece of the 1889 Paris Exposition, or world's fair.\nBuilt in little more than two years, it was at the time the tallest building in the world and soon became a defining image of the French capital.",
