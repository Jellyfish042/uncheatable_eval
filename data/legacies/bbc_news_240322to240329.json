    "A care home boss who raises funds for a cancer charity through his passion for jam-making has inspired a national fundraising day.\nAlister Cook from Higher Whitley, Cheshire, began fundraising for Lymphoma Action for helping his \"mental preservation\" after being diagnosed.\nNow care homes he heads are backing the charity by holding tea parties.\nDoddlespool Hall near Crewe is among those marking Mr Cook's 63rd birthday on Saturday 6 April with activities.\nThe home has invited members of the public along to an afternoon of fun which includes live music, stalls and a raffle.\nSome staff members said they were going in on their day off to help at the event which is on from 14:00 to 16:00 BST.\nThe home in Main Road, Betley, is among eight in the Cinnabar Support and Living (CSL) and Brancaster groups taking part. It includes bases in Buckinghamshire, Cumbria and South Yorkshire.\nMr Cook began making jams, marmalades and chutneys after moving to a farmhouse which had a rich variety of fruit trees and bushes.\n\"There were quite a few, damsons, apples and raspberry canes when we moved there seven or eight years ago,\" he said.\n\"And things fell off the trees and rotted, which is probably quite common these days.\n\"But I though this was a terrible waste.\"\nThe businessman, whose background includes retail and hospitality, began experimenting with recipes and giving the homemade delights to family and friends.\nHe was soon given the nickname Cheshire Jam Man and it stuck.\nBut he was surprised when he did a stocktake and found he had built a collection of about 150 jars of preserves.\nLast year Mr Cook's life changed  when he was diagnosed with cancer following a routine blood test for a prostate check. He was sent for an MRI scan.\n\"I was told I had low grade non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma and had no idea what that meant,\" he said.\nHe now believes night sweats he put down to the stress of running care homes during the Covid pandemic, may have been among symptoms he had experienced.\nMr Cook said he had been helped by \"great medics\" at The Christie hospital in Manchester but also supported by Lymphoma Action.\nHe said following chemotherapy and immunotherapy sessions, he was in remission but would still need regular treatment.\nThe charity has helped him cope with the mental side of the condition.\n\"It's about coming to terms with this black cloud that it's always there in my blood and will always be,\" he said.\nHe said going through hours of treatment meant \"you start thinking\" and he came up with the idea of asking for donations for his 'jam man' preserves to raise money for the charity.\nHe said some people had given \u00c2\u00a35 a jar and he quickly surpassed his \u00c2\u00a3500 target on Just Giving. Mr Cook has now raised more than \u00c2\u00a32,000.\nFundraising has also included a jam-themed \"bake-off\" between the homes where staff receive prizes for the best cake.\nMeanwhile, Mr Cook said with \"rhubarb on the way\" he was looking at new jam recipes, such as combining strawberry, vanilla, rhubarb and prosecco.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

    "It was Coldplay's international breakthrough hit and remains one of the band's best-known numbers: Yellow.\nBut could the main lyric be changed - just for one night - to appease fans focused on a local football rivalry?\nColdplay is headlining Radio 1's Big Weekend in Luton in May. While Luton Town play in orange, Watford, 17 miles (27km) down the M1, wear yellow.\nSome Lutonians are suggesting the Y-word could be easily switched. The BBC has asked the band for its reaction.\nLuton resident Bex Jones suggested Coldplay should change \"yellow\" to \"orange and blue\".\nIn an interview with BBC Three Counties Radio, Bex appealed to lead singer Chris Martin.\n\"Come on Chris, do it,\" she said. \"You have to, you're coming to Luton for one night only.\"\nKev Harper, from the Luton Town Supporter's Trust, said: \"The crowd would love it.\"\nHe joked Coldplay \"should have called it orange in the first place\" as \"it's a superior colour\".\nJames Taylor, head of regeneration at Luton Borough Council, said: \"The crowd would absolutely pop.\n\"It would honour the Luton fans and honour Luton as a team and as a town.\n\"We've seen some of the world's biggest football teams come to Kenilworth Road and have to adapt their style of play, so why not have the world's biggest band come to Luton and change the words just for us?\"\nAs it happens, Chris Martin says he wrote Yellow at Rockfield recording studios in the Welsh countryside while his bandmates were watching football.\nHe was inspired by seeing the starry sky, but the title came as he spotted the Yellow Pages across the room.\nWith the same number of syllables, it remains to be seen whether Coldplay will swap \"yellow\" for \"orange\" at Stockwood Park to keep Luton fans happy.\nLuton's old-school stadium, surrounded by the terraced housing of Bury Park, became football's most-memed away end when they got promoted in 2023 and returned to the English top flight for the first time since the 1991-92 season.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Women waiting for first breast-cancer assessment appointments with the South Eastern Trust have had appointments delayed due to a new patient record system, BBC News NI has learned.\nOne woman, red-flagged after finding a lump, said the wait was \"torture\".\nIn a statement, the health trust said it understood that the delays will be \"distressing for patients\".\nIt added that following assessment treatment will be offered as \"quickly as possible\".\nThe Department of Health's target for breast-cancer referrals is two weeks.\nThe 67-year-old woman who contacted BBC News NI has been waiting seven weeks after being red-flagged by her GP.\nThe woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the system was a mess.\n\"I have a lump in my breast, my mum died from breast cancer, there is a history of breast cancer in my family, it's the waiting that will kill me,\" the woman said.\nThe woman, who lives in the South Eastern Trust area, said she had been offered an appointment at a breast-cancer clinic at Altnagelvin, but there was no follow-up call to confirm a time.\n\"I have no problem travelling to another health trust, I would travel hundreds of miles to be examined, but sadly no-one came back to me.\" she added.\nThe South Eastern Trust said that the launch in November of 'Encompass', the new patient record system, had \"regrettably it had temporarily lengthened\" some appointments.\nBBC News NI can also reveal that there are 378 red-flag breast patients waiting to be seen in the South Eastern Health Trust.\nA red-flag referral means the patient needs timely investigations to rule out the possibility of cancer.\nThere has been a significant increase in demand for breast cancer assessment.\nTo cope with demand in the past 12 months the South Eastern Health Trust sent urgent patients to other health trusts for assessment:\nOver the next two years all five local health trusts are due to implement the regional 'Encompass' patient record system.\nThe South Eastern Health Trust said that means \"further temporary downturns in activity may be experienced\".\n\"The South Eastern Trust is working tirelessly with our regional colleagues, to reduce the number of patients waiting for red-flag breast assessments, as we completely understand the distress this can cause not just to them, but also to their families,\" it said.\n\"This is not the service we want to provide for our patients.\n\"While the introduction of the regional encompass digital patient record system has had a temporary, limited impact on the number of patients who can be seen, the main reason is the surge in demand, compounded by staff shortages.\n\"Since 2020/21 there has been a 26% sustained increase in the number of red-flag breast referrals to the trust. This rise in demand is an issue which is being experienced across all health trusts.\n\"It is important to note that a red-flag referral is to rule out cancer and on average, 3% of breast assessment patients will be diagnosed with cancer.\"\n'Absolutely diabolical'\nMacmillan Cancer Support has described the delay as \"extremely worrying\".\nIts policy and public affairs manager, Sarah Christie, said: \"I think it is absolutely diabolical to find that people are waiting even longer because of a system roll-out - we should have had safeguarding in place to mitigate against this.\n\"I think there's urgent lessons that need to be learned in terms of this rollout.\n\"Encompass is important, we need system transformation, but not at the detriment to people waiting to find out if they have cancer.\"\nA spokesperson for the Western Trust said: \"The Western Trust has been supporting the South Eastern Trust with their current challenges in red-flag breast referrals.\n\"It was agreed that the Western Trust would assist with providing two assessments only 'mega clinics' for South Eastern Trust patients, to be held at Altnagelvin Hospital.\n\"One of these clinics took place on 9 March with 100 South Eastern Trust patients being assessed. A further mega clinic will be taking place in the coming weeks.\"\n\"A significant staffing resource is required to facilitate the clinic from surgery, pathology, and radiology.\nResearch carried out by an independent group of experts on the healthcare systems in the UK and the Republic of Ireland said NI waiting list statistics are \"shameful for senior healthcare managers here and dangerous for the wider population, as it is acknowledged that long waits increase the risk of death\".\n\"Benchmarking Northern Ireland Health Care Performance\", carried out by an independent group of experts, said that cancer services are an important case in point, having not kept pace with rising demand, promises of improved cancer care for patients in Northern Ireland \"ring increasingly hollow\".\nThe Northern Ireland Audit Office commissioned the research, but said the findings had not been verified by them.",
    "Cancers diagnosed in people aged between 18 and 49 in Northern Ireland have risen by 20% in the past 25 years, according to new research.\nQueen's University Belfast and the NI Cancer Registry compared 2019 statistics with 1993 figures, when registry records began.\nFigures show that, by 2019, 1,076 people aged 18-49 were diagnosed with some form of cancer.\nProf Helen Coleman, who was involved in the research, said it was worrying.\n\"What's also worrying is that the types of cancers are changing,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"Traditionally among men it would have been testicular cancer and brain tumours. This research shows a rise in colorectal cancer instead.\"\nThe research looked at early onset cancers, which means cancers diagnosed in adults under the age of 50.\nIt found that cancers commonly seen in older people - such a bowel, breast, stomach and pancreatic cancers - are now being diagnosed in younger adults.\n'Not an old woman's disease'\nLisa Smyth was 39 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017.\nShe she was pregnant with her son at the time.\nLisa initially dismissed her symptoms as hormonal changes but, once they worsened, friends and family encouraged her to check for cancer.\n\"I thought 'how could it be cancer?' I'm young, I've always been fit and healthy \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but it's not an old woman's disease anymore,\"she says.\nLisa says when she goes for check-ups, she's sometimes one of the oldest women in the waiting room.\n\"The age of girls being diagnosed now is a lot younger and I have a lot of friends in the same situation,\" she says.\n\"I think the narrative needs to change, so that people are aware that you can get cancer when you're younger.\"\n'I still have a lot of life to live'\nAisling Gallagher,  a 31-year-old retail manager and online influencer from Crumlin, County Antrim was diagnosed with stage two colorectal cancer in September 2020.\nShe underwent radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy and, although she is now through her treatment, is still living with the after-effects.\n\"Obviously once you've had it you probably do have that, 'God it's going to return somewhere',\" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"For me, as well, after I had my surgery they found it in my lymph nodes and that's why I had to have the chemotherapy.\n\"I think that as well was always a wee bit of a surprise. I kind of thought once the tumour was taken away that would have been it,\" she said.\n\"So it's definitely something that's still there, but it's not something that stops me getting on.\n\"I need to just continue on with my life and I am still young, I still have a lot of life to live.\"\nChanges in environment and lifestyle?\nProf Coleman said researchers need to better understand what is causing cancers in young adults.\n\"The rise has also been seen in other western countries such as across the UK, America and Australia, which suggests it is something to do with changes in our environment and lifestyle.\"\nShe said there are various theories associated with the increase, including people eating more processed foods and taking antibiotics from an earlier age, but nothing definitive.\nRisk factors such as smoking, alcohol and obesity should not be ignored.\n\"We would appeal to men and women in the age group to be aware of any changes in their body that are unusual for them and to contact their GP if they have concerns,\" she said.\nDon't ignore symptoms\nProf Coleman stressed that the message needs to get out there that younger people can get cancer too.\n\"Don't just wait because you consider yourself to be too young to get cancer. Don't ignore any symptoms which are unusual to you. Early diagnosis is key.\"\nThe research highlights that within the 18-49 age group there was a higher incidence of diagnosis among women - largely driven by breast cancer cases.\nFrom 1993-2019 there was a 27% increase in the incidence rate of cancers in women compared to a 9% increase in men.\nThe most common cancers in men aged between 40 to 49 were colorectal, melanoma, lung and head cancers.\nIn women aged 40 to 49 the most common malignancies were breast, melanoma, and colorectal cancers.\nAccording to Prof Coleman, patients with early onset cancers face \"unique\" challenges across the entire cancer process from investigation and diagnosis through treatment to survivorship or end-of-life care.\n'Rebellious hope'\nNorthern Ireland's cancer strategy has yet to be fully implemented.\nProf Coleman said all those who took part in the review believes it highlights relevant areas for discussion about early onset cancers, including lowering the age of screening.\n\"Prevention and early detection are key to reducing disease burden and improving cancer outcomes,\" she added.\n\"As healthcare professionals and scientific researchers, we should be aiming to create treatment pathways for early onset cancers where at each stage patients and their families are given autonomy and support relevant to their individual circumstances, where their concerns are addressed, and treatm",
    "Misogyny, sexual discrimination and harassment are still everyday problems for female musicians in the UK, a damning new report has found.\nIt says that one third of women in the music industry have been sexually harassed at work, with many reporting it as a barrier to their career.\nWomen are also eight times more likely to face discrimination than men.\nThe findings come from the first ever UK Musicians' Census, conducted by the Musicians' Union and Help Musicians.\nIt surveyed more than 6,000 music industry professionals, of whom 2,526 identified as women.\nThe report said women are paid less than men, and often experience shorter careers, despite being trained and educated to a higher level.\nMore than a quarter of female musicians (27%) said they did not earn enough from music to sustain a career, compared to 20% of men.\nOn average, women earn 10% less than their male counterparts, with an average annual income of \u00c2\u00a319,850 compared to \u00c2\u00a321,750 for men.\n'Tidal wave of revelations'\nThe authors called the inequality \"alarming\", adding that women were facing ingrained, structural barriers to their career progression.\n\"It's vital that the industry makes genuine commitments and takes decisive actions\" to \"prevent\" the findings being repeated, said Nadia Khan, founder of the non-profit music development organisation Women in CTRL.\n\"True progress can only be achieved when we address these systemic issues head-on and create a more equitable landscape for women in music.\"\nThe new findings echo a report made by MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee in January .\nThey described the music industry as a \"boys' club\" where sexual harassment and abuse are \"endemic\", and called for legislation to tackle the problem.\nThe report, by a cross-party group of MPs, followed an inquiry into misogyny in the music industry, which began in June 2022.\nIt heard evidence from people including the former BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Macmanus, known as Annie Mac, who said there was a \"tidal wave\" of revelations about sexual assault in the music industry waiting to be told.\nThe broadcaster and writer told the committee about a female photographer who was taken on tour by an all-male band, only to be sacked after spurning the advances of the lead singer.\n\"She couldn't have won,\" said Macmanus. \"If she had gone with him, she would have been fired for being unprofessional, and she didn't want to go with him anyway.\"\nSinger and former X Factor contestant Rebecca Ferguson said in her evidence that misogyny in music was just \"the tip of the iceberg\" .\nShe said she was bullied by her management company when she tried to leave them, telling MPs that staff \"were instructed to ruin my personal relationships [and] ignore calls from my children\".\nAt one point, she was told: \"'When you earn as much money as you do, you do as we effing say'.\"\n'Attacked on stage'\nWomen who responded to the Musicians' Census had similar stories, with 51% saying they had experienced gender discrimination at work.\nA DJ from the East Midlands said she had been sexually assaulted on stage, and while travelling home late at night.\nAnother young musician, from London, said that harassment had affected her \"confidence and anxiety\" while playing gigs.\nThe report also highlighted that women face unique barriers to their career progression, particularly regarding childcare and age discrimination.\n\"Since the birth of my daughter I have had to turn down several pieces of work due to a lack of available, reasonably priced childcare,\" said one anonymous respondent. \"I have the impression that fewer offers have come my way as a result.\"\n\"There has been a certain amount of discrimination I've experienced especially when I started out as a DJ because I didn't look the right way compared to other female DJs of the time,\" added a Scottish musician. \"Now I'm older and facing a new type of discrimination because of my age.\"\nJobs are often stereotyped by gender, too, the report said. Only 12% of studio engineers, 8% of rappers, and 24% of DJs are women. By contrast, women account for 59% of the roles in classical music.\nNaomi Pohl, general secretary of the Musicians' Union, said stories like these illustrated how women were still being \"held back\" in the music industry.\n\"We have long advocated for better pay gap reporting, and hope the census findings will encourage the industry to take action, be more transparent and make change.\"",

    "For weeks, President Joe Biden and his senior officials have been losing patience with the way that Israel is fighting the war in Gaza.\nThey have used increasingly stiff language to convey their displeasure to Israel and the wider world.\nThe decision to allow the latest ceasefire resolution through the Security Council shows that President Biden has decided that strong words are not enough.\nRemoving diplomatic protection from Israel's conduct of the war is a significant step.\nIt shows the depth of the rift that has opened between the White House and Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu responded with a broadside directed at Israel's most important ally.\nHe condemned the US decision not to use its veto, saying it had harmed the war effort and attempts to free the hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October last year.\nJoe Biden and his top officials might file those remarks under the heading of extreme ingratitude.\nThe president is deeply attached to Israel, calls himself a Zionist, and has provided the Israeli people with emotional support as well as all the military and diplomatic assistance their state has needed since 7 October last year.\nHe wants freedom for the hostages as well as the destruction of Hamas as a military force. But Mr Biden wants Israel to do that, as he put it, \"the right way\".\nIn those devastating first weeks of the war President Biden warned Israel not to be blinded by rage, as America had been after the al-Qaeda attacks on 11 September 2001.\nThe US president travelled to Israel, comforted families of victims of the Hamas attacks and even embraced Mr Netanyahu, with whom he has never had an easy relationship.\nPresident Biden and his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who's visited Israel six times since 7 October, have repeatedly told Israel to respect international humanitarian law, which includes an obligation to protect civilians.\nAt the start of the war, as those first American warnings were being prepared, Prime Minister Netanyahu promised Israelis what he called a \"mighty vengeance\".\nSince then, more than 30,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed with weapons mostly provided by the US.\nWith Gaza in ruins, famine looming for Palestinian civilians and the prospect of many more deaths in an Israeli offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza, President Biden seems to have had enough of having his advice ignored.\nIsrael claims that it always respects the laws of war and denies that it blocks humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.\nBut evidence has piled up that the Israelis are not telling the truth, with children dying of hunger a few miles from ample stores of food in Israel and Egypt.\nThe Americans, and the rest of the world, can see the evidence presented by the UN and aid agencies that Gaza is on the brink of famine.\nThe US military is dropping aid by air and bringing a temporary dock across the Atlantic so that supplies can come to Gaza by sea, while Israel lets only small amounts through the port of Ashdod, a modern container terminal only half an hour's drive north of Gaza.\nThe decision not to veto the Ramadan ceasefire resolution is also an attempt by the Americans to push back at accusations that they have enabled Israel's actions.\nIt comes after Prime Minister Netanyahu has rejected, vehemently, the Biden Administration's plans to find a way through the worst Middle East crisis in decades.\nThe Americans are trying to show that Israel's impunity from international pressure has limits.\nSecurity Council resolutions are normally considered to have the force of international law. Israel must decide now whether it will respect the resolution, which has been welcomed by Hamas as well as the Palestinian representative at the UN.\nMr Netanyahu's coalition government relies on the support of Jewish ultranationalist extremists.\nThey will urge him to ignore the resolution. If he does, the US will have to respond.\nIf more words are not enough, the biggest lever at President Biden's disposal controls the air bridge of arms supplies to Israel, dozens of flights by huge transport planes bringing in the munitions Israel has used in the war, as well the ones it would need if it goes through with its plan to widen the ground war to Rafah.\nThe US-Israel alliance is deep - in 1948 President Harry Truman recognised Israel's independence 11 minutes after it had been declared - but at times it is dysfunctional.\nCrises happen when Israel defies the wishes of American presidents, and harms what they see as US interests.\nThis isn't the first time that Benjamin Netanyahu has infuriated the men in the White House.\nHe has done so regularly since he first became Israel's prime minister in 1996.\nBut his defiance of the US has never been this prolonged, or bitter, and no crisis in the long US-Israel alliance has been as serious as the one that's developed in almost six months of the Gaza war.",
    "Edinburgh residents have complained that some city parks now resemble graveyards because so many memorials are being placed on trees.\nHundreds of metal plaques have been appearing in places like Princes Street Gardens and The Meadows, sometimes accompanied by home-made displays.\nThe nameplates are installed through a scheme where donors contribute towards the planting and upkeep of trees.\nThe city council said it would carry out a review following complaints.\nThe Tree Time scheme is being run by Edinburgh and Lothians Greenspace Trust, in partnership with the council and Woodland Trust Scotland.\nUnder the pilot project, people can pay between \u00c2\u00a320 to \u00c2\u00a35,000. Larger donations allow people to sponsor an existing tree or pay for a new one to be planted.\nA personalised, commemorative plaque is nailed on the tree in recognition of the donation.\nSome families also add their own displays, often using rope to attach flowers, cards and personal keepsakes.\nThe Friends of The Meadows and Bruntsfield Links is an organisation which aims to help protect the historic park, which was founded in 1920. The majority of its committee members are opposed to the plaques on trees.\nConvener Jim Orr said the practice should not be encouraged.\n\"It harms the trees and causes litter. The trees are there for everyone, not for individuals,\" he said.\nAlistair Cant, who volunteers with the organisation, said he thought the metal memorial plaques should be removed.\n\"They are making the avenues of trees in the Meadows like a mausoleum,\" he said.\n\"The trees are public trees. The minute you put a plaque on it it feels like someone has slightly appropriated it... and I don't think it's appropriate.\n\"There's a growing proliferation. I'm sure the charity's aims are very worthy but I think they are not the right thing for a public tree and very busy public space.\"\nLocal resident Malcolm Webster, 72, said The Meadows was now \"a bit sombre\" because of the number of plaques.\n\"I don't want to feel like I'm in a graveyard when I'm walking through The Meadows,\" he said.\n\"Quite soon I will be looking at the cherry blossom, and I don't want to be looking at every tree with a plaque on it reminding me that somebody has died.\n\"If you go through a graveyard you know what to expect but I don't want to see that when I walk through The Meadows.\"\nHe added that he felt the home-made memorials attached to trees looked messy and cluttered.\nRichard Darke, a spokesman for Edinburgh and Lothians Greenspace Trust, said it made about \u00c2\u00a350,000 a year from the scheme.\nIt started in June 2019 in Edinburgh, and has since expanded to the Lothians.\n\"The idea is they get to adopt a tree for 10 years and then we will ask them if they want to continue adopting it.\n\"The prices depend on the location and type of tree. For example, someone paid \u00c2\u00a35,000 for one in Princes Street Gardens.\"\nHe said it would be difficult to take down the plaques and offer donors their money back, as the money had already been spent on trees across Edinburgh.\nPrinces Street Gardens, in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle, were created in the 1820s following the draining of the Nor Loch and building of the city's New Town.\nMr Darke added: \"Some people are delighted they can adopt a tree in a place they have a connection.\n\"It is a balance though and we do acknowledge that it's maybe reached its capacity now in The Meadows.\"\nPam Barnes, the convener of Friends of Inverleith Park, said people had different ways of remembering the dead.\n\"I think it can be a good thing they are willing to pay towards a plaque.\n\"However, if they then garland them, I think the council needs to explain to them it's not their own and it's still the council's property and can't be used as a memorial with anything extra.\n\"People need to be discouraged gently from doing it.\"\nVal Walker, City of Edinburgh Council's culture and communities convener, said the aim of the Tree Time initiative was to increase and maintain trees in the city.\n\"A part of this scheme allows residents to adopt a tree in order to commemorating a loved one's life, marking a child's birth, or celebrating a special anniversary or milestone.\n\"Adoption of an existing tree or contributing towards the cost of planting a new tree is marked with a personalised plaque.\"\nShe said the city's parks were spaces where people could remember those closest to them.\n\"However, we recognise that there is concern about the manner in which these plaques are attached to trees, and we'll be looking into this in further detail.\n\"We'll also be reviewing how we address other homemade memorial displays that appear in our parks.\n\"We're committed to making sure that everyone can enjoy our parks in a safe and respectful way.\"",
    "A former president of the Chinese Football Association (CFA), Chen Xuyuan, has been sentenced to life in prison for bribery, according to the country's state media.\nIn January, he pleaded guilty to taking bribes worth a total of 81 million yuan ($11.2m; \u00c2\u00a38.9m).\nAn anti-corruption crackdown led by President Xi Jinping has cut through sport, banking and the military.\nIn football, more than a dozen coaches and players have been investigated.\nThe trial at the Intermediate People's Court of Huangshi in central China revealed Chen's illicit activities from 2010 to 2023, which included his earlier role as the president and chairman of Shanghai International Port Group.\nProsecutors said Chen accepted money and valuables in exchange for his help with obtaining project contracts and arranging sporting events.\nThe court ruling said he had brought \"tremendous damage\" to China's football cause, according to the state-controlled Xinhua news agency.\nState media also said that three other senior football officials were sentenced on Tuesday to between eight and 14 years in prison for corruption.\nEarlier this year, an ex-Everton midfielder and former head coach of China's national men's soccer team, Li Tie, confessed to fixing matches and offering bribes to people, including Chen, to get China's top coaching job.\nChina's foreign ministry also confirmed that South Korea's Son Jun-ho, who played for Shandong Taishan, was held in police custody in relation to a bribery case . South Korea's foreign ministry said this week that he had been released from detention .\nIn the past President Xi has voiced his ambition to turn China into a major footballing nation. In 2011, he spoke of his 'three wishes' for Chinese football: to qualify for the World Cup again, to host the tournament and to one day win the trophy.\nOver the past decade, clubs in China's Super League have spent huge sums of money to attract some of the world's top players, including Brazilian midfielder Oscar, former Argentina forward Carlos Tevez and Belgian international Axel Witsel.\nHowever, that resulted in clubs piling up debts and the CFA announced a salary cap in 2020 .\nAt the time, it said the move was aimed to focus investment on developing homegrown talent instead of importing international stars.\nNow, only a small number of foreign players remain in the league.\nRecent detentions of major football figures have dealt another setback to the country's football ambitions.\nDespite these problems, domestic football is still popular in China and Mr Chen's corruption scandal shocked fans.",
    "A football club has said its future is being \"put at risk\" by delays to legal agreements over the lease of land for a new stadium.\nOxford United hopes to build a 16,000-capacity stadium near Kidlington.\nThere is still no binding agreement between the parties - six months after Oxfordshire County Council approved the lease of the site.\nThe authority said there was an \"ongoing dialogue\" with the club over the \"heads of terms\" agreement.\nA statement from Oxford United said: \"Six months after pledging to commit to a lease on the land at the Triangle the heads of terms and lease agreement have been agreed by the club but remain unsigned by the Council.\"\n\"We need the heads of terms and lease option with appropriate conditions signed as this is causing serious delay and is putting the project and the very future of the club at risk.\"\nAt a recent fans forum, the club revealed that the estimated cost of the stadium project had risen to \u00c2\u00a3130-150m, and that funding for it will come from a variety of sources including investment from the financial markets.\nIt is understood United have already spent more than \u00c2\u00a35m on the project to date, with a planning application set to be considered by Cherwell District Council this summer.\nIn a statement, Oxfordshire County Council said: \"The council remains in ongoing dialogue with the football club as regards heads of terms. However, the club does have an agreement in principle in writing subject to the conditions set out by cabinet.\"\n\"It is standard procedure for large developments that a sale or lease is not completed until after planning has been granted and financial institutions would fully understand this process.\"\nThe five-hectare (12-acre) site is located south of Kidlington roundabout, west of Banbury Road, east of Frieze Way and opposite Oxford Parkway Station.\nThe club, which says it has to leave its current home at the Kassam Stadium when its lease expires in 2026, released computer generated pictures of the proposed complex in October.

I spend two hours a day doing my competitions, and then I get on with my life.\"\nSince 2021, their wins have included all-expenses-paid holidays to Colombia and Norway, a \u00c2\u00a36,000 trip to Wrexham AFC, a Euros weekend at an English manor house and a \u00c2\u00a34,000 diamond ring.\nKazzy is a self-declared comper, defined as somebody who habitually enters competitions to win as many prizes as possible.\nHer success, she said, was down to mostly avoiding free online competitions, which get a lot of players, and focusing instead on creative contests.\u00c2\n\"They're called effort competitions, where you have to actually do something, take a video or a photo, go shopping, all those require a bit more commitment,\" she explained.\n\"That's what I'm good at, taking a nice photo, editing a little video or buying something.\"\nOne of the couple's most recent wins came after Kazzy spotted a competition run by the confectionery maker Swizzels, asking entrants to show how much of a fan they were.\nShe asked Lee to \"think about\" ideas for her entry. Instead, he came home from his job as a tattoo artist with the company's name tattooed on his knee.\n\"I was expecting him to have a think at work, not an ink at work, but he never ceases to surprise me,\" said Kazzy.\nLee's entry won the couple \u00c2\u00a31,000, which they spent on a trip to Morocco, plus a year's supply of confectionary and a VIP tour of the company's plant in Derbyshire.\nLast year they also won a trip for two to a private island off Colombia after a photograph of Lee doing a painting next to a can of beer took top prize in a beer company competition.\nKazzy also spent a week in Arctic Norway last June after an essay and video about why she wanted to experience 24-hours of sunlight won a competition run by Visit Norway.\n\"I didn't really know what was going on with that,\" Kazzy said.\n\"I arrived in Oslo all on my own thinking, 'Oh, my god what have I done?'\"\nHow do you become a comper?\nKazzy lost her two-year-old daughter Abigail to cancer at Easter in 1996.\n\"The only flower she knew the name of was daffodils. So I've always collected things with daffodils on,\" Kazzy said.\nKazzy's younger sister Nicola spotted a promotion by a jewellery company for St David's Day, with prizes that included daffodil jewellery.\nDespite never entering a competition before, Kazzy scooped the top prize of daffodil earrings, later writing to the promoter to say she felt she was \"meant to win\".\nA couple of months later, she won an Xbox in a crisps company's promotion.\n\"I just thought, 'this is really easy',\" she recalled, explaining how her search for new competitions to enter led her to the comper community online.\nOne of Kazzy's heroes is Di Coke, who goes by the comper name of Super Lucky Di.\n\"She is an amazing woman with a massive Facebook group with all the latest competitions,\" she said.\nThe pair recently met in Bridgend for a \"good natter\" about their shared hobby.\n\"We went quallie shopping together,\" she said, explaining how a quallie is the promotional product you must buy to be able to enter.\nOther comper lingo includes TTW (text to win), NPN (no purchase necessary), and PN (purchase necessary) contests.\n\"I'm a purchase necessary or creative comper,\" said Kazzy.\nAnd that means one thing for her weekly shop.\n\"If I'm gonna buy biscuits then why not buy a packet that gives me a chance of winning something,\" she said.\n\"If I don't win, we haven't lost anything because we've had the packet of biscuits.\"\n'We're not all on the dole'\nKazzy said compers can be stereotyped as spending all their time on the hobby.\n\"We're not all on the dole,\" she said. \"I'm a really hard working, busy woman.\"\nShe and Lee run three businesses, including his tattoo parlour and her sewing shop in Pembroke. She also works as an independent social worker and is doing a PhD on play in hospital settings.\nBut from 06:30 until 08:30 each morning, Kazzy said it was all about her competitions.\n\"It's a sense of community,\" Kazzy said of her online comper friends.\n\"Everybody shares competitions willingly and with absolute joy for people in our group who win.\"",
    "Spring 2024 has been unusually mild, but also very wet across the south-west of England.\nWhile temperatures were above average throughout the UK, February has been a particularly warm month across Devon and Cornwall, with mean temperatures more than 3C above the long-term average.\nThe region had the highest February mean temperature on record and it was the wettest on record.\nMarch has also been exceptionally wet. Average rainfall for Plymouth in March is between 70-80mm - but, so far this month, the city has had 165mm of rain.\nThe yearly total so far is 677mm - more than half of the rain we would normally see annually.\nMonday's rain was exceptional - 50mm is not a normal day in March.\nOn Dartmoor, the total rainfall this year is at 1384mm - just short of the rain the moors would normally see in a whole year.\nSo why is it so wet? Is climate change to blame?\nIt can't all be attributed to climate change, but that is a consideration.\nEl Ni\u00c3\u00b1o disruption\nThe weather across the south-west is linked to the rest of the world - what happens in Peru can influence the weather in Truro and Exeter.\nA weather phenomenon called El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o off the west coast of Peru is disrupting the trade winds globally, as well as the jet stream .\nAdded to this, sea surface temperatures around the south-west coastline are 2-3C warmer than average, giving low pressure systems more energy and enabling greater rainfall totals.\nThis winter, El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o has been strong, resulting in milder and wetter conditions across the UK, as well as frequent areas of low pressure bringing rain, especially in the last three months.\nRainfall observations show a large variability in annual, seasonal and decadal rainfall, but it has generally become wetter, particularly during winter.\nClimate projections indicate, on average, winters will continue to become wetter and summers drier, though natural variability will mean we will continue to see individual years that do not follow this trend.\nReservoir levels\nAs the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture, roughly 7% more per 1C of warming.\nThis brings a risk of increased frequency and longevity of heavy rainfall events in the future, particularly during winter if greenhouse gas emissions\u00e2\u0080\u00afcontinue to rise.\nWhat's the upshot of the rain? Reservoir levels are nearly full.\nAccording to South West Water, Roadford reservoir is full, as is Wimbleball, Stithians and Burrator, while Colliford on Bodmin Moor is 95.1% full.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

    "The mother of a three-year-old girl who lost her sight at 16 months is preparing to run the London Marathon.\nMia, from Essex, was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which led to her losing her vision overnight.\nBridie will be running the 26.2-mile race next month alongside Mia's aunt Cheryl, in aid of the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB).\n\"It's a cause very close to our hearts,\" said Bridie, an intensive care unit nurse.\n\"I want Mia to grow up in a world where she can access, and experience things, just like everyone else.\"\nAccording to the NHS, NF1 is a genetic condition that causes tumours to grow along the nerves.\n'Huge challenge'\nThe RNIB aims to raise awareness of the experiences of blind and partially sighted people in a bid to make society more accessible.\nChris Perrin, head of supporter led fundraising at RNIB, said: \"Running a marathon is undoubtedly a huge challenge for anyone so we are very grateful to have Bridie and Cheryl join Team RNIB this year.\"\nTogether they have beaten their fundraising goal, raising more than \u00c2\u00a34,000 for the charity.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A car sitting in a police compound was found to contain guns, bullets and drugs, a court heard.\nMerseyside Police found them after growing suspicious when several people rang up claiming to own the towed car.\nDanielle Wilson, 41, from Liverpool, admitted possessing crack cocaine and heroin after her DNA was found on some of the drugs she had helped to bag up.\nShe received a two-year jail sentence suspended for two years at Liverpool Crown Court.\nWilson's DNA had been been found on 17 wraps inside both bags.\nThe court heard there was no evidence to link the mum-of-two to the firearms, and the prosecution accepted her involvement was limited to helping to bag the drugs before they were hidden in the car.\n'Production line'\nWilson, of Palace Road, Walton, said she had been paid \u00c2\u00a3100 by a criminal gang to sit in a \"production line\", tying knots in individual wraps before passing them to another person.\nEmily Calman, prosecuting, told the court the Ford Galaxy was brought to the attention of police in Stanley Close, Kirkdale, on 13 April, 2022.\nShe said: \"It was in a poor state of repair. Officers made enquiries and found it was registered to an address in Birkenhead and insured to an address in Shropshire, under different names.\n\"Police took the vehicle to a compound, and after it was recovered they received a high volume of calls from people claiming to be the owner of the vehicle.\"\nThe search revealed the guns, a Glock self-loading handgun and a Grand Power pistol, stashed under the bonnet and beneath the boot compartment, as well as ammunition and a silencer.\nAlso in the boot compartment were two carrier bags containing several thousand wraps of crack and heroin, worth a combined \u00c2\u00a336,500 and weighing just under a kilogram.\nThe court heard Wilson had 10 previous convictions, including one for heroin supply dating back to 2007.\n'Dirty work'\nKate Morley, defending Wilson, said her client had played a minor role in the activities of the gang, limited to one hour helping bag the drugs.\nShe said: \"At the age of 41, with caring responsibilities, she ought to have known better.\n\"But the reality is she was used by those more experienced than her, who are very skilled at recruiting vulnerable people to do the hands-on dirty work.\"\nMs Morley said Wilson had been on bail for nearly two years after her arrest, and had kept out of trouble.\nShe also said she cared for her daughter, who has cystic fibrosis, and an immediate jail sentence would result in her children losing their home.\nJudge David Swinnerton told Wilson she had been \"stupid\" to get involved with drug dealing again after her previous conviction.\nHe said: \"All that risk for what is in the grand scheme of things a paltry sum.\"\nJudge Swinnerton said he accepted she had no involvement in the firearms, but warned her: \"That's the sort of world you are involving yourself in when you agreed to bag up Class A drugs\".\nHe said he had been persuaded that her limited role in the operation, her guilty pleas, a probation report describing her as of \"low risk\" of reoffending and the impact on her children meant he could spare Wilson immediate custody.\nWilson was ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work and 20 rehabilitation activity days with the Probation Service as part of her suspended sentence order.\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "A teacher's complaint that he was unfairly sacked for refusing to refer to a student by their preferred pronouns has been dismissed by an employment tribunal.\nKevin Lister, 60, was dismissed for gross misconduct in September 2022 by New College Swindon.\nHe refused to refer to a biologically female student by their preferred male name and he/him pronouns.\nMr Lister had denied violating the student's dignity.\nThe employment tribunal, held in Bristol, heard the pupil, named Student A, asked Mr Lister make the change in September 2021.\nHowever, Mr Lister said he started to gesture to the student rather than use their birth name or preferred name.\nHe said it was a \"gender-neutral communication style\" but accepted the student found it upsetting.\nAt the end of that month the pupil asked if he was eligible for an all-female maths competition.\nThe tribunal heard Mr Lister wrote the student's female birth name on a whiteboard in front of the class and said \"she could [enter the competition] because she was a girl\".\nSummarising his views presented during the hearing, the panel said: \"Mr Lister considered that [New College Swindon] required staff and students to celebrate 'students who had been persuaded to take wrong sex hormones' and likened the social transitioning of a child to the illegal act of performing FGM (female genital mutilation).\"\nIn its judgment, it said Mr Lister was dismissed due to his conduct and expressing his beliefs in an \"objectionable\" manner.\nIt found the student was not at risk from using hormones, and that Mr Lister had not adhered to the school's gender reassignment policy, which was intended to protect students from harassment and discrimination under the Equality Act.\nThe panel's decision focused on his behaviour towards Student A.\nOther matters, including his social media posts, were investigated but not included in its ruling.\nNew College Swindon said in a statement: \"We are pleased to confirm that the complaints of unfair dismissal and discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief have been dismissed.\n\"This is a sensitive issue, and individuals are entitled to their personal beliefs.\n\"A thorough investigation resulted in Mr Lister being dismissed for actions that were deemed discriminatory, causing significant upset and potential harm to a student, amounting to gross misconduct, and not simply for holding gender critical beliefs.\"\nMr Lister has since been barred by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) from participating in regulated activities with children.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "For many people, moving into a new-build home is a dream come true, but for some it turns into a nightmare.\nHomeowners have told the BBC about moving into unfinished developments and fighting lengthy, stressful battles with developers to get what they paid for.\nOne couple described cracks in the walls, a peeling floor, a leak and a gap between a floor and a wall, that all left them feeling like their two children were not safe in their property.\nAnother said residents in his development paid a service charge despite crucial infrastructure, like roads and pathways, remaining unfinished.\nA Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) report, published last month, has raised concerns about the build quality of some new homes, and a petition has been set up calling for government accountability for substandard housing and infrastructure.\n'It should have been the most special purchase of our lives'\nNewly-weds Gabriel and Lauren Pisani bought their family home in Reading last February.\nThe oven, freezer and plumbing in the kitchen were faulty on the day they moved in, and more than a year later they are still finding problems.\nThe floor in the hallway is peeling following a leak 10 months ago from an upstairs toilet, and there are cracks in the walls.\n\"We have had countless issues with the property since day one,\" Mr Pisani said.\nIn his one-year-old son's bedroom he pointed out an exposed gap where the wall and floor were not connected.\n\"We can't leave our son to have any time on the floor in his room,\" he said.\nHe said the experience had \"zapped all enjoyment from what should have been the most special purchase of our lives together\".\n\"We want to feel safe,\" his wife added.\nDeveloper Taylor Wimpey said it was \"committed to providing homes and customer service to the very highest standard and we are sorry that these customers have experienced problems with their property\".\nIt added it was \"working closely\" with the family \"to resolve a number of issues and are fully committed to completing all outstanding work\".\n'It left a bitter taste in my mouth'\nJulia Dowd moved from Hampshire to Cramlington, Northumberland, in December 2020.\nShe had issues with uneven flooring in the upstairs of her Persimmon property and there were problems with the brickwork.\nAfter losing faith in the developer, she hired an independent snagging company to look at her home and it compiled a report of the defects.\nShe was then able to present that to her the developer as leverage to get her property fixed.\n\"I hadn't appreciated how much of a fight you would have to put up with to get things done,\" she said.\n\"It left a bitter taste in my mouth.\"\nIn January, she started a petition, which has since been signed by almost 2,000 people, demanding the government be more accountable for substandard housing and infrastructure across the country.\n\"It does feel like you have greater consumer rights purchasing a faulty toaster than you do making your most expensive purchase, which is a house, and I feel like we need an overhaul of the whole process,\" she said.\n'We pay a fee to maintain public spaces which haven't been completed'\nFor several years Kevin Graham has been battling with Persimmon to get infrastructure on his housing estate in Sherborne in Dorset finished.\n\"Initially, I was happy that construction would be ongoing for a number of years but it has ended up taking 10 years to complete,\" he said.\nHe said roads, pathways and children's play parks remained unfinished.\nResidents on the Corelli estate pay a fee to First Port management company, appointed by Persimmon, for maintenance of the area.\n\"We are on an incomplete estate and we are having to pay a service charge to maintain the public open spaces which haven't yet been completed,\" Mr Graham said.\nPersimmon said: \"We are dedicated to meeting our commitments at our developments, and work programmes are well under way in Northumberland and Sherborne.\n\"We apologise for any inconvenience our customers have experienced and are committed to addressing their concerns as we aim to complete our developments to a high standard.\"\nFirst Port said: \"This development has been partly handed over to us and some areas remain the responsibility of the developer.\n\"Our main priority is to ensure that the communal areas we manage are well-maintained and safe for residents.\n\"We will continue to work closely with the developer to ensure the outstanding areas of the development are completed.\"\nThe CMA study found a growing number of homeowners in England were reporting a higher number of snagging issues -

    "The glass used to create beads discovered at a prehistoric settlement dubbed \"Britain's Pompeii\" was probably made in Iran, analysis has revealed.\nThe finds were among a wealth of well-preserved items unearthed at a burnt-out 3,000-year-old village at a quarry in Whittlesey, near Peterborough.\nAmber, shale, siltstone, faience and tin beads were also discovered.\nPrehistoric jewellery expert Alison Sheridan said their survival, at Must Farm, was \"absolutely thrilling\".\nThey reveal the \"really cosmopolitan connections\" of Must Farm's residents, according to Dr Sheridan.\n\"Some of the beads must have been got from northern Britain and possibly even Ireland, while the glass came from a very, very long way away across the sea,\" she said.\nThe remains of a settlement of about 10 circular wooden houses on stilts built above a river was discovered by the Cambridge Archaeological Unit between 2015 and 2016 .\nBelieved to be home to 50 to 60 people, the cause of the fire that destroyed it in 850BC is unknown. The settlement and its contents were preserved because it fell into silt in the river.\nThis included \"by far the largest find of glass beads from any Late Bronze Age context in Britain,\" according to Dr Sheridan and co-author Julian Henderson.\nThey contributed to the necklace and beads report as part of the post-excavation analysis published by the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.\nProf Henderson, an expert in ancient technologies at Nottingham University, concluded the glass used to create 48 of the beads most probably came from Iran, while the glass from the 49th bead originated from Egypt.\nA 23mm-long (0.9in) teardrop-shaped glass object, believed to be a by-product of glass-making, was also discovered and Prof Henderson and Dr Sheridan described it as \"without parallel\" from Bronze Age Britain.\nDr Sheridan, who examined the non-glass beads, was \"instantly struck by the amber bead because it was so fantastic that it survived at all, as normally amber will burn\", she said.\nThe \"slightly charred\" find probably came from Scandinavia and may have been made into a bead in Ireland.\n\"But there is also the faience [glazed ceramic] bead, the only one known from this late Bronze Age period in Britain, while the tin bead is incredibly rare, as it doesn't usually survive, it tends to oxidise,\" she said.\nThe dig has drawn comparisons with the Roman city of Pompeii in southern Italy, which was buried under volcanic debris in AD79, because it provides an insight into Bronze Age life just as that era was ending.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "New road schemes that reflect the climate emergency and put Wales at the forefront of design could be considered, the new transport secretary said.\nThe Welsh government scrapped all new major projects in 2023 on environmental grounds.\nBut new Transport Secretary Ken Skates said schemes including a third Menai crossing could be considered.\nMr Skates has taken on transport in new leader Vaughan Gething's cabinet .\nHowever, when asked about the possibility of reviving the M4 relief road at Newport on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement , he said  \"the opportunity has come and gone\" for that.\nWhile opening the door for new roads, he said: \"We have to ensure that they reflect the reality of the climate emergency that we face.\n\"I want Wales to be at the forefront of design and implementation of new schemes.\"\nAll major road-building projects were scrapped in February 2023 over environmental concerns, including a third crossing of the Menai Strait between Anglesey and the mainland, and the controversial \"red route\" in Flintshire.\nMr Skates said: \"We haven't stopped building roads, but we do need to deal with the criteria for new road building schemes which states that you can't build them if it leads to extra capacity.\n\"That's caused difficulty in terms of considering schemes, and interpretation.\"\nMr Skates, the MS for Clwyd South, insisted any new roads would need to be \"better\" than those built in the past and dependent on available funding.\nWhen asked about the possibility of plans for an M4 relief road in Newport being revived, Mr Skates said \"the opportunity has come and gone\".\nIn 2019, proposals were axed because of its cost and impact on the environment.\n\"I just can't see that happening.

    "When Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was arrested on Thursday on claims of corruption, it came as no surprise.\nMonths earlier, in November, Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had run a door to door campaign, asking residents of India's capital whether he should resign or run his government from jail.\nMr Kejriwal and other senior party leaders face corruption accusations under investigation by India's powerful federal financial crime agency, the Enforcement Directorate (ED)\nHe is the third AAP leader to be arrested over a case related to a now-scrapped liquor policy in Delhi. This policy involved the government relinquishing control of the liquor market to private vendors.\nMr Kejriwal has denounced the investigation, arguing that the ED had failed to frame \"specific\" charges against him and called the summons \"generic\" and \"illegal\".\nMr Kejriwal's arrest, contrasting his anti-corruption campaign that took India by storm in 2011, comes less than a month before India's general elections, starting on 19 April. His AAP is part of the 27-party INDIA alliance aiming to challenge the governing BJP.\nIn just over a decade, AAP, despite being a newcomer, has emerged as a formidable force.\nIt has secured successive victories in Delhi's state elections since 2013 and expanded its influence by winning crucial polls in Punjab, where discontent against federal government policies prevails.\nThe party is contesting four of the seven parliamentary seats in the capital in the upcoming general election. In 2019, it lost all seven seats to the BJP. However, the AAP swept 67 of the 70 assembly seats in Delhi in 2020.\nWho is Arvind Kejriwal?\nA mechanical engineer from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, Mr Kejriwal later served as a government officer in the Income Tax department.\nHe gained prominence for his work with Parivartan, an organisation that popularised the use of India's Right to Information (RTI) law which allows people to access information held by the government.\nIn 2006, he received the Ramon Magsaysay award for using the RTI to \"empower citizens to monitor and audit government projects and inspire local community action\".\nIn 2011, Mr Kejriwal backed social crusader Anna Hazare's hunger strike for the establishment of a citizen's ombudsman to investigate corruption. Inspired by the campaign's success, which stirred India, he founded the AAP, pledging to eradicate corruption.\nMr Kejriwal became the chief minister of Delhi for the first time in 2013. However, he resigned after 49 days when his party failed to pass the ombudsman bill in the assembly.\nHis resignation proved strategic, portraying him as a principled politician willing to give up high office in the fight against corruption.\nThis bolstered his party's growth, leading to a sweeping victory in the 2015 Delhi assembly elections. In 2020, his party secured another victory in Delhi.\nThe fight to retain power\nThe AAP claims that the BJP seeks to topple its Delhi government despite its dominant position in the legislative assembly. Along with other opposition parties, it accuses the BJP of targeting opposition leaders through central agencies.\nThese agencies are investigating money-laundering allegations against the chief ministers of three southern states and other political opponents. The BJP denies any political motivation behind the investigations.\nMr Kejriwal's party has faced numerous investigations.\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Manish Sisodia , Mr Kejriwal's former deputy chief minister, in February last year accusing him of favouring some cartels after the liquor policy came into effect.\nSimilarly, AAP's top lawmaker Sanjay Singh was arrested last October for allegedly accepting money from middlemen of liquor barons who profited from the same policy.\nIn his third term as chief minister, Mr Kejriwal faced new challenges.\nThe Hindu nationalist BJP emerged as AAP's main rival in Delhi, prompting the chief minister to appeal more to Hindu religious sentiments.\nAlso, anti-corruption rhetoric alone wasn't sufficient for AAP's electoral success in Delhi, say analysts.

    "A council has ordered the removal of an \"eyesore\" sculpture 10 years after it was refused planning permission.\nThe four-metre (13ft) bronze figure commemorates Prince Philip's 35 years as chancellor of Cambridge University.\nPlanners have told property firm Unex that the \u00c2\u00a3150,000 statue, called The Don, on the city's Hills Road, appears to breach planning control.\nCambridge City Council said the firm had until 11 April to lodge an appeal against an enforcement notice.\nThe notice has been directed at Unex - plus a law firm and a property management company.\nIt said there appeared to have been a \"breach of planning control\" and the sculpture was \"unauthorised\" and must be removed by August.\nThe Cambridgeshire-based Unex Group has been approached by the BBC for comment.\nThe Don appeared on land at Charter House last year, the council said on Wednesday.\nThe authority said previously it was \"not clear exactly when the artefact was commissioned or when it was completed, but it has been in storage locally for some time.\"\nThe authority defended the refusal of planning permission for the sculpture, saying \"the installation of the proposed artefact 'The Don' would have a negative impact on the character\" of the area.\nIt also warned: \"It is also likely that acceptance of this variation would make it more difficult to ensure that the environment in the city as a whole is enhanced by appropriate public art in the future.\"\nIn January 2014, the council's planning committee considered a planning application relating to the sculpture.\nThe committee was told that the sculpture was by Pablo Atchugarry and called The Don.

An enforcement notice had been issued earlier this month.\n'Eyesore'\nCity councillor Katie Thornburrow described the statue, bearing a plaque naming the late Duke at its base, as \"controversial\".\n\"The figure, supposed to represent Prince Philip in his robes as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University with mortar board and tassel, is cast in bronze but painted black and white, with a twisted bronze abstract 'head',\" she said on her website .\n\"It has been described as 'kitsch-like' and 'detritus masquerading as public art',\" she added.\n\"I will be glad to see it gone, but remain angry that developers could just dump it in place and then force the council to spend officers' time and money getting them to take it away.\n\"We deserve better.\"\nA local political commentator also said he had \"never been a fan\" of the Hills Road sculpture.\nPhil Rodgers, a political commentator and former Liberal Democrat election agent, said the sculpture was an \"eyesore\".\nHe said in a tweet: \"Fantastic news ... that an enforcement notice has been served to remove this eyesore in Hills Road.\"\nHe told the BBC: \"I have to say I am not a fan.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Nearly one in five teachers in England has been hit by a pupil this year, a survey commissioned by the BBC says.\nOne teacher told BBC News behaviour was a \"never-ending battle\". Another said spitting, swearing and chair-throwing were among the things happening often.\nA union says its members are reporting worsening violence and abuse from pupils since the Covid pandemic.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) says it has invested \u00c2\u00a310m in behaviour hubs to support schools.\nUsing the survey tool Teacher Tapp, BBC News asked up to 9,000 teachers in England in February and March a series of questions about their experiences with behaviour in the classroom.\nA greater proportion of primary and secondary teachers reported pupils fighting, pushing and shoving compared with two years ago.\nLorraine Meah has been a primary school teacher for 35 years, for the last five of which she has chosen to do supply work - covering lessons on an ad-hoc basis - because it is more flexible.\nOver that time, she says pupils' behaviour has worsened.\nShe says she has seen nursery and reception-aged children \"spitting and swearing\", with the worst behaviour from five and six-year-olds with \"dangerous tendencies\" like throwing chairs.\n\"You will get three or four children in your class displaying challenging behaviour. That's hard to deal with when you've got a class of 30,\" says Mrs Meah, who teaches in the Midlands.\nAnother Midlands-based teacher, Zak Copley, did supply teaching for a year and also says behaviour is \"definitely getting worse\" and sometimes feels like a \"never-ending battle\".\nOn one occasion, the computer science teacher said he had to pull pupils apart after they began \"throwing punches\" at one another.\n\"The room got absolutely ransacked,\" he says, remembering that displays were \"ripped off the wall\".\nOn another occasion, a pupil who had been sent out of class tried to break back into the room with a cricket bat, he said.\nIn Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, St John Fisher Catholic Academy for 11 to 18-year-olds is working hard to improve its behaviour.\nIn 2022, it was rated \"inadequate\" by Ofsted, whose inspectors found poor behaviour by pupils, including frequent fighting, made others feel unsafe.\n\"There was a culture of bullying and an atmosphere of intimidation,\" says Karl Mackey, the school's fifth head teacher in six years.\n\"We had a lot of internal truancy - kids going into toilet cubicles vaping and using mobile phones.\"\nSince Mr Mackey joined a year ago, his new behaviour policy has seen pupils rewarded for good attendance.\nCorridors are closed off to stop children being able to wander the whole school if they leave a lesson. There are strict rules about going to the toilet during lessons and mobile phones are banned.\nHe has also brought in more subjects including dance, drama and music.\nYear 9 pupil Tamika was excluded from her previous school, and says pupils at St John Fisher have \"settled down\" since the rule changes.\n\"I find it easier to co-operate with teachers and speak to them if I am struggling with a lesson, and I can get my head down,\" she said.\n\"There are less students going round kicking off. If they do, there will be steps in place for them to reflect on their behaviour - like going into isolation, or being sent home.\"\nMr Mackey says the school tries its best to avoid suspending children if possible.\nHe says the whole school community, including local residents, have noticed children behaving better.\n\"There's been a real shift. This year you'll see them in lessons every single day, not late, in perfect uniform, trying their hardest,\" he added.\nIn the Teacher Tapp survey, the BBC also found:\nDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT union, says teachers are reporting that violence and abuse in schools \"have risen notably\" since the pandemic.\n\"This is being compounded by cuts to specialist behaviour and mental health services for children, which have left teachers doing their best to fill the gaps and meet the needs of pupils that really require the skills of specialist counsellors and therapists,\" he said.\nFormer DfE behaviour adviser Tom Bennett told BBC One's Breakfast programme, on Tuesday, it had been a problem for \"decades\" after being \"brushed under the carpet\".\n\"Up until about five or six years ago there wasn't much by way of [teacher] training in behaviour management, which would probably astonish a lot of people,\" he said.\n\"We need to make sure schools are looking at teaching the behaviour they need, having boundaries and having consequences - a fairly simple structure but quite hard to put into practice.\"\nThe DfE says \"decisive action\" is being taken to improve pupil behaviour.\nA spokesperson added it had doubled its mental health and wellbeing scheme for head teachers this year, backed by \u00c2\u00a31.1m.\nIn 2020, the DfE launched a \u00c2\u00a310m behaviour hub programme to allow hundreds of struggling schools to be paired with others to learn new ways of dealing with poor behaviour.\nThe programme finishes ",
    "By the time the crew of the Dali, a massive 948ft (289m) container ship, realised what was happening, it was already far too late.\nThe vessel - at the very start of a 27-day journey from the port of Baltimore to Sri Lanka - completely lost power after leaving the port and was hurtling towards the city's iconic Francis Scott Key Bridge.\nIt was the middle of the night and the crew onboard were pitched into further darkness when the ship's lights suddenly went out.\nThe vessel was dead: there were no electronics and - crucially - no engine power. They were adrift but powerless to stop what was happening.\nMultiple alarms rang out as the crew ran unsuccessful tests in a desperate attempt to fix the issue and regain power.\nA local pilot onboard the vessel frantically gave orders, telling the crew to steer the rudder hard to port and drop anchor to keep it from drifting starboard.\nWhile an emergency generator is believed to have kicked in, the ship never regained the use of its engines.\nThe pilots were left with no choice. Shortly before 01:30 (05:30 GMT), they issued a mayday call warning authorities that a collision was imminent.\n\"There's a ship approaching that has lost their steering,\" an official with the Maryland Transportation Authority can be heard saying in radio traffic recorded not long after. \"Until you've got that under control, we've got to stop all traffic.\"\nMaryland Governor Wes Moore later hailed the crew as \"heroes\" and said that their quick response had \"saved lives\" because authorities were able to stop the flow of vehicle traffic on to the bridge in the two minutes between the call and the collision.\nIt did not, however, stop what happened when the Dali slammed into a concrete column on the 1.5-mile (2.4km) bridge, which quickly collapsed, piece by piece, into the dark, cold waters of the state's Patapsco River.\nSix people - all believed to be members of a road crew working on the bridge - are presumed dead due to the water temperature and time that has passed . The US Coast Guard said in the late evening on Tuesday that it had concluded the men had died and intended to suspend its massive search and rescue effort, which had been complicated by cold and cloudy weather.\nLocal media had reported that the six workers were citizens of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The BBC has not independently confirmed this and has contacted consular authorities for comment. All 22 crew on the ship were Indian - the country is a major player in the global seafaring industry.\nThe ship's crew were all accounted for and none appeared to suffer significant harm.\nThe dramatic destruction of the bridge - which opened 47 years ago  - left many in the city, including Governor Moore, shaken.\n\"This is a place that is a normal commute route for 30,000 Marylanders every single day. To hear the words 'the Key Bridge has collapsed' is shocking. It's heartbreaking,\" Mr Moore said at a news conference on Tuesday.\n\"For over 47 years, it is all that we've known.\"\nWhat exactly led to the loss of power on board the Dali remains unclear.\nJennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that investigators would now seek to examine data from a voyage data recorder.\n\"It's a critical piece of our investigation,\" she said, adding that for now, the inquiry remains \"about people\".\n\"It's about families and addressing the needs of those that were impacted.\"\nAs the sun rose over Baltimore on Tuesday morning, residents of the diverse and strongly working-class areas near the bridge expressed shock at the scene they had woken up to.\n\"I felt it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The whole house shook,\" John Flansburg, who lives near the water, told the BBC. \"Today's not going to be a good day. A lot of tragedy.\"\nAnother area resident, Darlene Irwin, said that she first knew there was a problem when she heard a \"rumbling sound\".\nHours later, the scale of the destruction became apparent when she looked out her window at the Patapsco River.

I think the majority of people are living at home longer, which has its challenges, and a lot of people are in rented accommodation and potentially people are in sub-standard accommodation because they can't afford to have a decent place to live.\"\nIt is a region-wide situation that Gloucestershire Rural Community Council (GRCC), which helped Sophie find her home, has been dealing with.\nCara Loukes, the GRCC's affordable housing manager, said holiday lettings and second-home buying had seen many landlords take properties out of the longer-term private rental sector.\nThat in turn has seen \"more and more people need to move onto council waiting lists\" while it was taking years for new affordable rental homes to be developed.\nFor local people on lower incomes the options were limited, Ms Loukes said.\n\"You will probably need to rely on friends and family, possibly sofa-surfing, inappropriate rentals - people are living in caravans, insecure housing, garages - or hoping eventually for affordable housing to come through,\" she explained.\nIf the situation is not tackled, Ms Loukes warned, \"communities will die, socio-economically\".\nCrisis 'worsening'\nThe new report by the County Councils Network (CCN) warned that the number of households in private and social rental properties in rural areas has increased by 550,000 between 2011 and 2021.\nIt found that rented properties - both social and private - now make up almost one third of all housing in England's county council regions.\nIn private renting, there had been a 31% rise - higher than London's increase of 25%.\nThe report also found that property prices in those counties are the most unaffordable in England outside of London, with the average price now more than \u00c2\u00a3309,000, that waiting lists for council housing in the countryside increased by 10% between 2018 and 2023 and that temporary accommodation use was up by 52% over the last five years.\nMeanwhile, rural homelessness had risen 18% over the last three years.\nRichard Clewer, the CCN's housing and planning spokesperson, said: \"It is widely accepted that the housing crisis is one that is worsening, with rising unaffordability locking hundreds of thousands out of getting onto the property ladder.\n\"This report does not suggest that we alleviate these issues by concreting over our countryside.\n\"Instead it sets out a number of important yet easily deliverable recommendations that, taken together, could accelerate the delivery of new homes of all tenures where there is most need.\"\nThe CCN is calling for government to set out a new plan for rural housing, with a greater focus on social housing and a review of the right-to-buy policy that has seen affordable rental properties taken off the market.\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said it was putting \u00c2\u00a310bn towards boosting housing supply and \u00c2\u00a311.5bn into providing more affordable homes.\nAlthough only around 234,000 new homes were delivered last year, she said that the government's target to build 300,000 homes a year remained and that the Renters Reform Bill would \"deliver a fairer private rented sector for both responsible tenants and good faith landlords\".\n\"We are committed to creating a fair housing system that works for everyone in both urban and rural areas, including increasing first-time buyer numbers in all regions and boosting availability of new, genuinely affordable housing,\" she said.",

    "Canada's maple syrup reserve - the world's only - has reached a 16-year low, raising questions about the future of a globally loved sweet staple in the face of climate change.\nThe reserve, located in Quebec, is designed to hold 133 million pounds of maple syrup at any given year.\nBut in 2023, the supply fell to 6.9 million pounds (3.1 million kg).\nExperts link the shortage to both a rise in demand and warmer weather, which has disrupted production.\nBut they say that this will not affect the availability or price of maple syrup to consumers - at least for now.\n\"The strategic reserve is holding its lowest amount of maple syrup since 2008,\" Simon Dor\u00c3\u00a9-Ouellet, the deputy director general of the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, told the BBC. \"But we do not foresee any supply issues in the near future.\"\nCanada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.\nAccording to national data, a majority of that - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.\nThe amount of maple syrup in the national reserve - stored in tens of thousands of barrels in several warehouses across Quebec - has dwindled significantly since 2020. That year, the reserve had more than 103 million pounds of the sticky product.\nNow, the amount in the reserve is only 7% of what it was four years ago.\nPart of the reason why, Mr Dor\u00c3\u00a9-Ouellet said, is because of poor harvest seasons over the last few years.\nMaple syrup production, which is typically done between early March and late April, relies heavily on a delicate balance of below freezing overnight temperatures and warmer daytime temperatures above 0C (32F).\nThe cold temperatures help the maple tree absorb water from the soil, while the warmer weather during the day creates pressure that pushes water down to the bottom of the tree, making it easier to harvest the sap.\nIn 2021 and 2023, warmer spring temperatures felt across the country resulted in a reduction in maple syrup production, which fell 21% in 2021 from the year prior.\nThis reduction, however, came on the heels of two consecutive record years of production, in 2020 and 2019.\nMr Dor\u00c3\u00a9-Ouellet said that because of the harvest unpredictability, fluctuations in the reserve's supply are not unusual.\n\"The strategic reserve was put in place to stabilise supply - which is highly weather dependent - for buyers,\" he said. \"In the last four years, that is exactly what it has done.\"\nCoupled with the poor harvest years is a rising demand for for the golden product.\nIn 2021, Canada exported 161 million pounds of maple syrup to 71 countries worldwide -  an increase of more than 19% from the year before.\nMr Dor\u00c3\u00a9-Ouellet said the growth in demand is tied to Quebec's efforts to promote Canadian maple syrup and its benefits to other countries, primarily the US, UK, Germany, Australia and Japan.\nWith the reserve supply dwindling in the face of growing demand, many are keen to see how the upcoming harvest season unfolds.\nCanada is coming out of one of its warmest winters on record. Temperatures in December, January and February were the warmest since record-keeping began in 1948.\nDespite this, Mr Dor\u00c3\u00a9-Ouellet said there is reason to be optimistic.\n\"The sugaring season has come early this year and is still underway,\" he said. \"So far, production has been plentiful and the weather forecasts are encouraging for the next few weeks all across Quebec.\"\nBecause the reserve stabilises the maple syrup market for producers and buyers, he said it is important that it be built back up.\nEfforts to do so are already underway, including the release of 14 million new taps to producers over the last three years to bolster harvesting efforts, he said.\nMr Dor\u00c3\u00a9-Ouellet did note that replenishing Canada's maple syrup supply is a \"multi-year process\", adding that he believes the outcome of the 2024 season will not \"make or break\" the future of Canada's most iconic export.",
    "A rare white magpie was spotted among a group of the more common kind - showing birds of a feather don't always flock together.\nAmateur photographer Terry Wright photographed the creature, which he nicknamed Joy, in Pembrokeshire earlier this month.\nThe bird is leucistic, which means it lacks pigment in its feathering.\nThe Welsh Ornithological Society said the bird was very unusual.\nThe pictures were taken in Fishguard on 9 March.\nMr Wright, from Abercych, said capturing the images left him feeling like \"the luckiest man alive\".\nThe 54-year-old has a condition called vitiligo, which has caused pigment loss in parts of his skin.\nHe said seeing the bird made him feel \"a bit more at ease, thinking 'it's not just me'\".\n\"To know that it is [a thing] in the animal world as well is quite wonderful, and to see it being accepted as one of the group was quite lovely,\" he added.\n\"I kind of felt a connection with it. It was really bizarre, it was somehow meant to be.\n\"It was quite comforting to see this bird, I felt totally at ease. It was really special.\"\nThe bird has been reported to be as rare as one-in-a-million.\nBut the Welsh Ornithological Society's chairwoman, Anne Brenchley, said while the bird was very unusual, she could not be certain of its scarcity.\n\"You do occasionally see leucistic birds, but I have never seen a magpie,\" she said.\n\"It tends to be chaffinches and jackdaws and blackbirds. It is clearly a magpie and the other birds clearly recognise it as a magpie.\n\"In terms of lifespan of a leucistic bird, because it is a white bird it could be picked off by a predator.\"\nAccording to the British Trust for Ornithology, leucistic birds lack a substance called melanin which results in them having white feathers.\nThe organisation said albino and leucistic birds could be distinguished by eye colour .\nAlbino birds have pink eyes, while leucistic birds' eyes are dark.",
    "A man who murdered his partner and then claimed she had injured herself on a pool cue has been jailed for life.\nRichard Basson fatally shot Carrie Slater with a pistol at their home in Long Clawson, Leicestershire, but \"absurdly\" told police she had walked on to the cue he was jabbing at her.\nBasson denied murdering Ms Slater but was convicted after a trial at Leicester Crown Court.\nJudge Martin Spencer said Basson told a \"web of lies\" to conceal his actions.\nThe 45-year-old was ordered serve a minimum of 32 years in prison when he was sentenced on Wednesday.\nThe court heard Basson, a heroin addict, shot at Ms Slater, 37, twice at close range during an argument at their home on 21 September last year, using a semi-automatic handgun he was illegally looking after for an associate.\nHis first shot missed her, causing her to duck and flinch, but his second struck her in the front of the head inflicting a devastating brain injury.\nThe judge said Basson had tried to conceal his crime, retrieving a bullet lodged in a wall and hiding it, along with the gun, in the garden of the couple's bungalow.\nHe said Basson had also wiped down surfaces to try to cover up his actions before calling 999.\nMs Slater was taken to hospital where medics established she had suffered a gunshot wound.\nShe died two days later, the court heard.\nThe judge said Basson told officers a \"plethora of lies\" and falsely claimed she had attacked him with a knife.\n\"It seems likely you and Carrie had an argument and you overreacted and lost your temper,\" the judge said.\n\"You may have thought, absurdly, that the bullet, if retrieved, could be a match for the brassy end of a pool cue.\"\nHe told Basson: \"You spun a web of lies. You were motivated by saving your own skin rather than any concern for Carrie.\"\nMr Spencer said Basson had been \"coercive, dominant and controlling\" towards Ms Slater throughout their relationship, which began in 2017.\n\"The sad fact is when she moved in with you, she started to lose contact with her family,\" the judge said.\n\"You were not a good influence on her. Your relationship was dysfunctional, and at times violent on your part.\"\nIn a statement read to the court, Ms Slater's half-sister, Claire Slater, said: \"Carrie was such a fun, loving, young lady.\n\"Her life didn't have to end this way.\n\"She was loved by so many. Carrie will never ever be forgotten.\"\nMs Slater's other half-sister, Louanne Leonardi, said the family had been devastated by her death and that she had suffered flashbacks of the moment police informed her of the death.\n'Horrendous case'\nBasson had earlier admitted a charge of possessing a firearm illegally and received a six-year sentence.\nHe also admitted having ammunition without a certificate and was given 30 months in custody. He will serve the terms concurrently.\nFollowing the sentencing hearing, Det Insp Emma Matts, of Leicestershire Police, said: \"My thoughts and condolences go out to Carrie family and loved ones. I know they are struggling to understand why she was killed.\n\"Only Basson knows why he did what he did. He claimed to love her but has never fully explained his actions.\n\"While no sentence will ever bring Carrie back, I am pleased Basson has been brought to justice for this horrendous case.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "A ban on importing hunting trophies to the UK has moved a step closer to becoming law with a vote by MPs.\nBody parts of elephants, bears, lions, hippos and zebras are among those currently allowed to be brought back from hunting trips.\nThis is the third attempt to pass a new law to tackle the issue and the bill is still at an early stage.\nOpponents argue profits from trophy hunting go towards protecting endangered species.\nBut environment minister Rebecca Pow said the government would support the bill to ensure trophy hunters \"are not putting additional pressure on already threatened species\".\nGovernment backing means a bill has a far greater chance of making it on to the statute book.\nBut the legislation will undergo further scrutiny and, to become law, will have to clear its remaining parliamentary stages before a general election expected later this year.\nLabour MP John Spellar, who is shepherding the private members' bill through Parliament, welcomed the 49-to-zero vote, saying the legislation would help protect endangered species all over the world, including polar bears from Canada.\n\"The public really do not want these magnificent animals to just be slaughtered, not only for a bizarre form of pleasure but to decorate people's houses,\" said the MP for Warley.\n\"Australia, France, Belgium and other countries have already shown the way by banning the trade in hunting trophies.\n\"I hope what we decide here will start to send a message to other countries that this is an international movement... and we need to move on from this.\"\nConservative MP Henry Smith said his own attempt to get an earlier version of the bill through Parliament ran out of time last year when \"a very small minority of peers... sought to block this legislation\".\nHe urged the Lords to support this bill, adding \"this is not a natural practice of people in southern Africa - it is a neo-colonial import\".\nA Lords briefing paper last year stated 190 hunting trophies from Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (Cites) listed species were imported into the UK in 2020.\nMultiple MPs urged wildlife lovers to use film and not guns to shoot animals in their own habitat, including Tory MP Tim Loughton who said trophy hunters could instead \"show how brave and manly they are by getting up close with cameras rather than guns\".\nConservative former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers highlighted how the death of Cecil the Lion had outraged people across the country.\nBut Tory opponent of the measure, Sir Bill Wiggin, President of the Association of Professional Shooting Instructors since 2006, labelled the reaction to Cecil's death \"knee-jerk\" and warned MPs against \"blundering into inadvertent racism\".\n\"The picture, widely circulated, of Walter Palmer standing over Cecil's body, became emblematic of man's destructive relationship with nature,\" he said.\n\"Reasonable though this reaction is, it is knee-jerk - it fails to acknowledge that for many Africans trophy hunting is vital for the local population.\n\"It's a wildlife conservation measure that generates income used to combat illegal poaching.\"\nOutside Parliament, academic Professor Amy Dickman agreed with opponents of the bill that it could do more harm than good.\nProf Dickman, Director of Oxford University's Conservation Research Unit WildCRU, said: \"The Parliamentary debate today was riddled with misinformation.\n\"MPs pushing for a blanket import ban demonstrated that they were willing to ignore scientific evidence, major risks to conservation and animal welfare, and the rights and livelihoods of affected people.\"\nBut Edith Kebesiime, of World Animal Protection Africa, said it was \"extremely encouraging that this important bill has been resurrected\".\nShe said: \"African people do not support trophy hunting. Most money from these hunts does not reach local communities.\n\"It is nothing but an opportunity for a cruel and wealthy few to inflict pain and suffering on our native wildlife for their own enjoyment.\n\"The UK's trophy hunting import ban will help us protect our wildlife heritage and make space for wildlife friendly conservation solutions.\"\nEduardo Goncalves, of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, said they were delighted.\n\"Sick sport shooting of magnificent animals is an anachronism in today;s world,\" he said. \"It's simply a dirty facet of a shameful past, where both man and beast were used and abused by a wealthy minority.\"\nA pledge to ban the import of hunting trophies was included in the Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto.",

    "A father-of-two said a headset that stimulated his brain using electronic pulses had been a \"key part\" of his recovery from depression.\nAshley Riley, from Northamptonshire, took part in an NHS trial that used the device to treat the disorder.\nHe signed up after medication alone failed and said he was now \"able to be a full-time dad again\".\nProf Alex O'Neill-Kerr, a consultant psychiatrist, said it may not work for all, but he had seen positive results.\nThe device works by stimulating brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the front of the brain, an area linked with depression.\nIt delivers weak electrical currents, through electrodes placed on the forehead.\nA camera in an app helps the user put on the headset in the correct way. It also controls the electrical current using Bluetooth.\nAccording to the latest available data from the Office for National Statistics, one in six people has experienced moderate to severe depression.\nMr Riley, 52, runs a public relations firm and said: \"I couldn't work, I couldn't interact with my family on a day-to-day basis.\n\"Some of the memories from before, like when your children ask your wife, 'why is daddy crying in the toilet?' are really tough.\n\"You wake up with depression and it follows you around all day. To feel you've got some hope in the day is really important.\"\nMr Riley was given the device to use at home for 15 minutes a day, five times a week.\n\"I'm fully functioning now,\" he said. \"I'm able to work again, I'm able to be a dad and be a husband in the way I need to be.\n\"I'm able to exercise and do my running, take part in parkrun UK with my boy and pretty much have a normal life.\n\"You put on this headset, and you get this little tingling when you use it... but it becomes part of your treatment and you do start to feel more positive.\n\"I'm able to reduce my medication, I'm able to reduce my therapy.\"\nThe trial, run by Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (NHFT), was the first to look at mental health patients using the device from the NHS in the community.\nIt found out of 14 people with moderate to severe depression, 10 experienced improvements.\nProfessor Alex O'Neill-Kerr from NHFT said he was initially sceptical because of the low-level current of the device, but said it was important to explore alternatives to medication.\n\"If you fail three or four antidepressants, the chances of you responding to treatment is pretty much zero and that represents one third of patients with depression.\n\"I've seen patients of mine that I've known for months if not years, get better with transcranial direct-current stimulation.\"\nA wider double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving 173 patients in the US and UK, showed that 56% of people were relieved of all depressive symptoms within 10 weeks .\nErin Lee, the chief executive of Flow Neuroscience, which makes the device, responded to criticism that it had been questioned by the results of a third study.\n\"Our brain runs on electricity and there is an immense amount of research about why this is an effective treatment.\n\"When you look at brains that are depressed there is less activity in the region that's associated with mood and memory, and what we're doing targeting that region with electrical impulses to push it back to a healthy state.\"\nThe National Institute for Clinical Excellence said experts advised that the headset would particularly benefit people for whom antidepressants would not work.\nThe NHS is extending trials of the device to cover postnatal depression and NHS medical staff who have depression.\nIf you are experiencing emotional stress, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "The owner of theme parks including Alton Towers and Legoland is to make it more costly to visit on a sunny bank holiday than a rainy day midweek.\nMerlin Entertainments, which also runs the London Eye and Madame Tussauds, is introducing \"dynamic pricing\" so prices can respond faster to weather and demand.\nMerlin said it would help offset a decline in visitors since the pandemic.\nAround 20 of its global venues will see the changes this year.\nMerlin Entertainments already uses off-peak and peak time pricing which, like many organisations, allows seasonal fluctuations to dictate demand and therefore price.\nBut the introduction of machine learning will make flexible ticket pricing faster and more detailed.\nFor example, if a sunny Saturday during the summer holiday turns out to be less busy than expected, the firm could lower ticket prices on the day.\nSimilarly, if a winter's day unexpectedly turns out to be busy, prices could rise higher than current off-peak prices, even during what is normally considered a cheaper time to visit.\nMerlin said in a statement that such a pricing structure \"makes sure that the peak period experience is optimised by avoiding overcrowding\".\nIt added that \"these changes enable greater flexibility for guests booking online to choose discounted prices for select dates and times\".\n\"We had it in 2023 and we had the highest guest satisfaction scores in the history of the company, and seven million additional guests,\" chief executive Scott O'Neil said. \"So we're definitely getting the signal that our processes are moving in the right direction\".\nHowever, there has been some criticism of the \"dynamic pricing\" model used by companies such as Uber and restaurants, partly due to its lack of transparency about why prices are high some of the time.\nIn February, US burger chain Wendy's was quick to clarify that it was not introducing dynamic, or \"surge\" pricing. One of the company's most high-profile critics, left-wing senator Elizabeth Warren, said the plans meant people \"could pay more for your lunch, even if the cost to Wendy's stays exactly the same\".\nMeanwhile, Mr O'Neil said \"dynamic\" pricing would help \"protect the guest experience\" during busier times of the year by managing queues, where waits of more than an hour are routine.\nMerlin said on Monday it had made record revenues of \u00c2\u00a32.1bn in 2023, an increase of 8% year on year, with much of the revenue coming from international tourists visiting the capital. Nearly one in every four visitors to London came to a Merlin attraction, the company said.",

The White House said it had warned Russia earlier this month of plans for a potential attack in Moscow targeting \"large gatherings\".\nRussia's National Guard said it had special units working at the scene to hunt down the attackers. Top Russian officials also headed to Krasnogorsk.\nTwo weeks ago, the US embassy put out a warning to US citizens to avoid large gatherings, saying it was monitoring reports that \"extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow\". It updated its advice on Friday evening , urging US citizens to avoid the vicinity of the attack.\nMore than 6,000 Russians had flocked to the Crocus City Hall retail and concert complex for a concert by rock group Picnic.

Picnic's band members themselves were unharmed.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not yet directly addressed the nation.\nA security guard described how the heavily-armed attackers burst into the foyer firing bullets as he and his colleagues were working at the central entrance.\n\"There were three other security guards and they hid behind an advertising board,\" he told Russian telegram channel Baza. \"And those attackers passed 10m [30ft] away from us - they started shooting randomly at people on the ground floor.\"\nInside the auditorium a woman said she and other visitors rushed towards the stage, as soon as they realised shots were being fired. \"I saw a person in the stalls with a sidearm and there were cracks [of gunfire] going off, I was trying to crawl behind a loudspeaker,\" she told Russian TV.\nFire and plumes of smoke rose into the sky and the hall's facade burst into flames as glass on the top two floors of the building blew out.\nThe fire appeared to have started when the attackers threw some kind of incendiary device.\nOne man, Vitaly, described seeing the attackers opening fire while he was on a balcony in the concert theatre: \"They threw some petrol bombs, everything started burning. We were led out towards an exit.\"\nAnother eyewitness said children and teenagers were in the complex at the time of the attack, taking part in a ballroom dancing competition.\nWhile some of those in the concert hall were able to flee to the parking area from the stage, others headed to the roof and Russian authorities said about 100 more had escaped through the basement.\nDozens of ambulance crews were immediately sent to the scene and stood outside the complex in Krasnogorsk for some time after the attack.\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin responded by cancelling all public events in the capital over the weekend. \"I am sorry for the loved ones of the victims,\" he said.\nIn the following hours several other regions also cancelled events, including Russia's second biggest city St Petersburg.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called on the international community to condemn the incident, calling it \"a monstrous crime\".\nUkraine's government was quick to deny any involvement in the attack, which comes more than two years after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour.\n\"Regardless of everything, for Ukraine everything will be decided on the battlefield,\" presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Telegram.\nOnly six days ago Vladimir Putin won a fifth term in Russian presidential elections. The vote did not include any genuine opponents and Western countries denounced the elections as neither free nor fair.\nUkrainian military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov suggested the attack was a \"deliberate act of provocation by Putin's special services\", without offering any evidence.\nFriday night's attack was the worst targeting civilians in Moscow for years, but it brought back memories of a theatre siege in the capital in 2002, when 40 Chechen militants took more than 900 people hostage during a musical called NordOst.\nRussian security services eventually stormed the theatre, pumping sleeping gas into the hall. Some 130 hostages died.\nSecurity has now been tightened at airports and stations.\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby said the images of ",

    "Heartstopper star Bradley Riches has revealed how his autism posed a constant challenge as a contestant in the latest series of ITV's Celebrity Big Brother.\n\"The kitchen was white - the white lights were absolutely disgusting,\" said Riches, whose autism shows up through sensory sensitivities.\nHe disclosed that his fear that the bright lights might trigger a sensory overload led him to spend a lot of his time either outside, or in the bathroom with fellow housemate David Potts.\n\"Luckily the lights weren't as bad in the bathroom. It felt more comfortable and less distressing there,\" he told the Access All podcast.\nThat wasn't Riches' only coping mechanism in the Big Brother house, which he shared with the likes of music managers Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh.\nThe first autism-related challenge Riches had to face came before he had even entered the house and was greeted by cheering crowds outside.\n\"I had my earplugs in, which was very helpful. It allowed me to be more present because I wanted to absorb all of it, but also I didn't want to be so overwhelmed that I just shut down and had a breakdown.\"\nThe lack of routine in the house was a further problem.\nLike many autistic people, another characteristic of Riches' condition is feelings of anxiety triggered by a sense that the world feels chaotic.\nRiches normally copes by carefully structuring his day into what he describes as \"like a school timetable\".\nThe 22-year-old used a similar approach to tackle his shooting schedule on productions such as 1917 and Saltburn.\n\"I used to structure my schedule daily. For filming I have to structure my routine weekly,\" he says.\nAnd this technique helped him navigate his time in the house.\n\"I got my brain around it quite easily. I blocked off three weeks, and that was my routine and I expected the unexpected. Once I was in that routine, I felt very comfortable and very open with everyone, I was on a roll.\"\nRiches began to feel comfortable enough to let his housemates see him stimming, which is self-stimulatory behaviour like making noises or repetitive body movements, for example with a hand or a finger.\nIt usually occurs when an autistic person feels overwhelmed or overstimulated by their environment, and the repetitive movements act as a way to process those feelings.\nRiches told Access All he feels that he has helped other autistic people by allowing the cameras to show him stimming.\n\"I just felt so accepted, and I was like, if I want to stim I'm going to stim and not feel ashamed of it.\"\nRiches added that people on social media said, 'he's literally stimming, like, how important is that?'. He said: \"I really felt so comfortable in that situation.\"\nRiches also revealed that his autism meant he did not speak until he was 10 years old.\n\"I would use sounds or movements to communicate. I became really reserved,\" he said.\nThat only changed when his grandmother encouraged him to boost his confidence by taking acting classes.\n\"I started to find these people who are very similar to me and I started to use my voice as a form of communication. It allowed me to accept myself a lot more.\n\"Acting was an escapism. I was playing these characters who were far away from me, and it made me find me.\"\nRiches went on to train at drama school, before Netflix's LGBTQ drama Heartstopper came calling.\nHe says the show changed his life. After a walk-on part in the first season, he was asked back to star as James McEwan in season two.\n\"For them to remember me for one line was unheard of,\" he says. \"I met so many amazing people on that show.\"\nRiches has already filmed the third series, which is due to be released in October.\nBut he is staying tight-lipped about what is next for his character.\n\"Who knows? I want to keep my job!\" he says.\nListen to the podcast and find information and support on the BBC Access All page.",

    "The environment secretary has apologised for not \"formally\" stepping back sooner from a decision on a controversial power plant in his constituency.\nSteve Barclay has vocally opposed the planned scheme in his Cambridgeshire seat, which requires a permit from an agency sponsored by his department.\nThe decision has been handed to a junior minister in the department.\nIt came after officials raised concerns after Mr Barclay's role in the process.\nMVV Environment, a German energy company, wants to build the plant in Wisbech, in Mr Barclay's North East Cambridgeshire constituency.\nIt would be one of Europe's biggest waste-to-energy incinerators, burning non-recyclable waste in order to generate energy for local industrial use.\nThe scheme was given the go-ahead last month by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (Desnez), following a recommendation from the Planning Inspectorate.\nBut to move ahead, the scheme also requires a permit from the Environment Agency (EA), sponsored by Mr Barclay's environment department.\nAfter the energy department gave its approval, Mr Barclay told his local newspaper the decision was \"terrible news\" and he would \"continue to do everything possible to fight\" against the incinerator being built.\nThe BBC has seen legal advice which raised \"serious concerns of perceived bias\" over a plan to stop the incinerator being built.\nLabour has also raised questions over Mr Barclay's role, asking for him to disclose any communication he has had with the Environment Agency.\n'Wasn't made aware'\nAt a scheduled appearance before a committee of MPs, Mr Barclay was asked to confirm when he formally recused himself from the decision.\nMr Barclay did not give a date, but apologised to the committee for not \"formally recusing myself sooner,\" and noting his opposition to the scheme on his ministerial register of interests.\n\"I said the policy needed to be delegated to another minister, recognising the importance of the ministerial code in terms of conflicts of interest and also the perception of any conflicts of interest,\" he said.\n\"I wasn't made aware until later that I required a formal recusal. I thought by delegating it, I had acted to, in essence, take myself and step back from it.\nBut he added he did so \"as soon as I was notified\" by the most senior civil servant in his department.\nHe also told MPs he had never \"made representations as secretary of state\" to the Environment Agency about the project.\nMr Barclay still faces questions over when he formally stood back from the project, and handed the decision over.\nIt has also not been confirmed when a decision on the incinerator will be made. It also remains unclear whether the decision will be subject to a legal challenge.\n'Perception of bias'\nLegal advice seen by the BBC offers a view on \"the proposal for an urgent direction to the EA to pause permitting applications for up to a year.\"\nIt concludes that this \"would be unlawful because the consultation undertaken with the EA was plainly inadequate. The context of the secretary of state's constituency interests and recent public comments adds powerful exacerbating feature given the perception of bias.\"\nThe BBC revealed last week that concerns about Mr Barclay's relationship to the case had been raised by civil servants, prompting discussions with Whitehall's propriety and ethics unit.\nFollowing Mr Barclay's committee appearance, Labour's shadow environment secretary Steve Reed said the public \"deserve answers\".\n\"Who did Barclay try to persuade, when, and which other ministers were involved?\" he asked.",

    "There's a familiar look about the Assembly Chamber at Stormont this week - it's empty.\nOK, cheap shot alert - they will be back after the Easter recess.\nThere's a debate to be had about the possible merits of assembly members forgoing the two-week break only seven weeks after returning from a two-year suspension but this is not the place.\nInstead, let's look at how they've done since the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ended its boycott .\nI asked a colleague to list the achievements so far. He said: \"It's survived.\"\nWhich is true, but perhaps not entirely fair.\nIf this was an end-of-term school report it would be \"satisfactory\".\nThough marks would be added for good behaviour.\nThe head prefects have even had a highly successful school trip - to the United States - and taken part in some unusual extra-curricular activities .\nThere was a potentially awkward moment when it looked like Michelle O'Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly were, for once, going to do separate interviews after meeting the Queen at Hillsborough.\nWe asked why - and there was a last minute rethink, which may mean something or nothing.\nCertainly there's nothing to suggest relations are anything but cordial.\nThe relationship \"is not warm but it's not cold either\" said someone who spends a lot of time in their orbit.\nSo back to those achievements of Stormont reborn.\nOr, to put it another way, what, if anything, has changed?\nWell, offers have been made in an effort to settle several public-sector pay disputes. Some successful, some still not.\nMinisters have agreed to provide \u00c2\u00a3150m to build the Strule Shared Education Campus in Omagh.\nThe executive has discussed the scandalous situation surrounding the defective apartments at Victoria Square though it's far from clear what they're going to - or can - do about it.\nBut at least the finance minister was able to announce that Land and Property Services is going to pause the issuing of rates bills this year .\nAll of these things fall into the category of \"easy wins\".\nAnd they would certainly not have happened were we still beholden to the blink and you'll miss it \"rule\" which went before.\nMore difficult may be the task of agreeing a budget before the end of April.\nThen there's the absolute minefield of Casement Park , which will not wait much longer and threatens to cause a major rift between Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in and the DUP.\nThere was a hint of the bad old days when the DUP revisited the issue of EU involvement in Northern Ireland on the last sitting day before recess.\nLet's spare you the details (anything called an applicability motion defies mass appeal) but the upshot is the DUP laid down a marker by vetoing a new EU law from applying here.\nSome of the other parties, with possible justification, claimed it was all to do with the DUP's internal issues over post-Brexit trading arrangements and the decision to restart devolution.\nIt hasn't gone away you know.\nHard times to come?\nExpect more of this. What happens if the Westminster government were to overrule Stormont on a similar issue in future?\nWhat would be the DUP's response?\nAnd we await with interest to see what happens the first time the DUP attempts to pull the Stormont Brake, which cannot be far off.\nSo seven weeks in, Stormont's inhabitants - and those who care about its survival - can breathe but not relax.\nThe really hard bit is undoubtedly still to come.",

    "The family of a man who died following an eight-hour wait for an ambulance said he had \"again been let down\" as the government has failed to respond to a coroner over the issue.\nAfter Ken Heard's death after a heart attack, a coroner said action should be taken to prevent future deaths.\nThe government was under duty to respond by January but still has not.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said took \"the coroner's findings extremely seriously\".\n'No-one came'\nThis was not the first time coroners in Cornwall have submitted Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports to the government on similar issues, and two more reports are being prepared.\nKen Heard was a volunteer hospital driver for NHS patients.\nHis daughter Susan Bray said: \"For the last seven years he made sure that people that needed to get to hospital [got there] and, the day he needed it, no-one came.\"\nMr Heard's widow, Jean Heard, 77, recalled how she was \"just walking the floors\" after making a 999 call reporting her husband had had a heart attack in July 2022.\nAn ambulance arrived eight hours and 10 minutes later. The national target to attend callouts for heart attacks - known as category two - is an average of 18 minutes.\nGuy Davies, assistant coroner for Cornwall, concluded that Mr Heard died from a cardiac arrest at the Royal Cornwall Hospital following a heart attack \"which was untreated due to\" the delay.\nHe wrote a Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) report to the government in November 2023 after the inquest.\nThis was the third PFD report highlighting the same issues within 12 months.\n'Systemic challenges'\nThe document, sent to Ms Victoria Atkins MP, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said it was \"more likely than not\" that Mr Heard would have survived had there not been the ambulance delay.\nIn the report, Mr Davies said: \"Action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.\"\nThe previous reports had already raised concern about long waits for ambulances to hand over patients to hospital, impacted by a backlog in patient discharges, due to pressure on social care provision.\nAndrew Cox, chief coroner for Cornwall, said the challenges were \"systemic\".\nThe Coroner's Office said responses were outstanding to the two most recent reports, which had deadlines of 18 and 20 January.\nMs Bray said the lack of timely response from the secretary of state was \"another let down\".\n\"It feels like he's just been let down twice now,\" she said. \"The government's not taking any accountability for it.\"\nMs Bray said: \"I think my dad had so much faith in the system. He just always assumed that, when he needed it, it would be there.\n\"I feel it's really sad, I feel like we're letting our parents down - a whole generation.\"\nThe two reports being prepared by the Coroner's Office relate to two deaths in September 2023.\nPatricia Van Der Eyken, 93 passed away at her home while waiting for an ambulance, which arrived about two hours and 40 minutes after 999 was called.\nHer son Tim said it was \"shocking\".\nHe said: \"It is deeply upsetting to discover my mother did not need to lose her life that morning.\n\"People's lives are at risk and the secretary of state for health needs to be held to account.\"\nRobert Prowse, 86, from Penzance, died from sepsis after an ambulance delay.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said its Delivery Plan for Recovering Urgent and Emergency Care Services - backed by \u00c2\u00a31bn of dedicated funding - aimed to improve waiting times within urgent and emergency care.\nThey added: \"We have already seen significant improvements in ambulance response times this year - with average category one responses in the South West over 15% faster this winter than last - but we know there is more to do.\n\"We take the coroners' findings extremely seriously and will respond in full shortly.\"\nThe latest ambulance waiting times in the south west region for the most serious call-outs in January were nine minutes and 45 seconds - the second worst in England.\nIt should take 15 minutes to transfer a patient from an ambulance to A&E but, during the winter, waits were the worst in the country in Cornwall and Devon.\nThe latest available data showed 88% of ambulances waited for 30 minutes or more to transfer patients to the Royal Cornwall Hospital, compared to the England average of 27%.\nRosanna Ellul, from the charity Inquest, said: \"The government need to take much more responsibility in overseeing these reports and create a new independent public body... to increase transparency and accountability.\"\nA statement on behalf of the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Integrated Care System offered its \"sincere condolences to the family and friends of the patients affected\".\nIt said: \"Any occasion where the care we provide falls below the high standards our patients deserve and rightly expect is unacceptable.\"\nThe statement said it was \"committed to addressing the complex issues highlighted in the coroner's repo",
    "Security researchers believe a Russia-based disinformation group amplified and added to the frenzy of social media conspiracies about the Princess of Wales's health.\nIn the days before Catherine revealed her cancer diagnosis in a video message, there had been a surge in online rumours and often wild claims about her health, adding to the emotional pressure on the princess and her husband Prince William.\nNow security experts analysing social media data say there were hallmark signs of a co-ordinated campaign sharing and adding to the false claims and divisive content, both in support of and criticising the Princess of Wales.\nThe researchers say this is consistent with the previous patterns of a Russian disinformation group.\nThe accounts involved were also spreading content opposing France's backing for Ukraine, suggesting a wider international context for the royal rumours.\nThis particular foreign influence network has a track record in this area, with a focus on eroding support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion.\nThe BBC had previously tracked down amateur sleuths and real social media users who started and drove speculation and conspiracy theories.\nEven without any artificial boost, these claims had been racking up millions of views and likes. And algorithms were already promoting this social media storm about the royals, without the intervention of networks of fake accounts.\nBut Martin Innes, director of the Security, Crime and Intelligence Innovation Institute at Cardiff University, says his researchers found systematic attempts to further intensify the wave of rumours about the princess, with royal hashtags being shared billions of times across a range of social media platforms.\nProf Innes has identified a Russian disinformation group involved in this. It's not a state entity, but it is linked to people who have been sanctioned recently in the United States over claims they were part of a \"malign influence campaign\" that spread fake news.\n\"Their messaging around Kate appears wrapped up in their ongoing campaigns to attack France's reputation, promote the integrity of the Russian elections, and denigrate Ukraine as part of the wider war effort,\" says Prof Innes.\nHe says the operatives running this rumour machine would be seen in Russia as \"political technologists\".\nTheir approach is to fan the online flames of an existing story - tapping into disputes and doubts that already exist - which Prof Innes says is a much more effective approach and harder to track than starting misinformation from scratch.\nHe says they \"hijack\" popular claims and inject more confusion and chaos. It then becomes harder to separate the co-ordinated disinformation from individuals sharing conspiracies and chasing clicks.\nBut the social media data, examined by the Cardiff University team, shows extreme spikes and the simultaneous sharing of messages in a way that they think is consistent with a network of fake accounts being operated.\nDr Jon Roozenbeek, an expert in disinformation at King's College London, says such Russian involvement in conspiracy theories is \"topic agnostic\" - in that they don't really care about the subject, it can be anything that \"pushes buttons\" and adds to social tensions.\nHe says they seek out \"wedge issues\" in an opportunistic way.\nShowing the scale of the challenge, TikTok says it took down more than 180 million fake accounts in just three months.\nMany of the accounts spreading the Catherine conspiracy theories were newly created this month, says Prof Innes. They fed off a so-called \"master\" account, which in this case had a name which was a version of \"master\", with a cascade of other fake accounts replying to and sharing messages and drawing in other users.\nIdentical phrases - such as \"Why do these big media channels want to make us believe these are Kate and William?\" - were churned out by multiple accounts. Although real people are known to re-share the same message on their own accounts in this way - a tactic referred to \"copypasta\" - there are other clues about the accounts, which suggest a more organised network.\nAnother phrase about Catherine was shared at the same time by what were ostensibly 365 different accounts on X, formerly Twitter. There were also new TikTok accounts, created in recent days, that seemed to put out nothing but royal rumours.\nThe Cardiff researchers highlight an overlap with a Russia-linked fake news website, published in English, complete with a \"fact checked\" logo, which has a stream of ghoulish and bizarre stories about Catherine.\nAlso UK embassies in Russia and Ukraine both had to put out fake news warnings last week about claims being circulated that King Charles was dead.\nWhen it comes to saying who is responsible for such disruptive activities, it can be difficult to attribute networks of accounts to a particular group, organisation or state.\nAnd further muddying the waters will be all kinds of individuals, interest groups and other overseas players commenting o",

    "A cancer diagnosis is always distressing, but most of us in that position don't feel compelled to make a recording that will be watched by millions.\nThe Princess of Wales and her family had asked for privacy.\nInstead, on a beautiful spring day, directly addressing the camera, we saw a princess having to come to terms with shocking news - and having to make it public.\nFor weeks there have been claims that Kensington Palace's PR strategy was failing, as online rumours went viral and then evidence-free conspiracy theories were repeated in media outlets around the world.\nThere was the disaster of the Mother's Day photograph, which was meant to quell the conspiracies and instead launched many more (although I doubt the PR team knew the image had been edited when it was released).\nCatherine's emotional video certainly feels like a reset. Palace insiders have been keen to make clear it was always the plan; that, just as the King informed the nation he had cancer, the princess was always minded she would too - and the timing was designed to coincide with the children's school holidays.\nBut as she and her family face whatever lies ahead, there's anger at what some perceive as bullying of the princess, with the suggestion that she was forced into making the video, rather than the more usual route of a written statement, by the relentless and far-fetched swirling conspiracy theories.\nSir Craig Oliver, former Downing Street director of communications told me: \"One of the subtexts of the Princess of Wales's message is clearly - please think before you indulge in hurtful speculation.\"\nKensington Palace had been clear that Catherine had a right to privacy. It will have been horrified by how quickly rumours spread once the princess was no longer in the public eye.\nHow upsetting it must have been, in the midst of the diagnosis, to have questions about her marriage aired on American television, and lurid speculation rife online. Even more upsetting perhaps, to know how many people were enjoying indulging in the rumours.\nIn a very different way, Catherine's video reminded me of Elizabeth II's TV address after Princess Diana died. The late queen had felt compelled to appear in public, after criticism, on that occasion in the press, about her absence.\nShe too had been trying to protect her family, prioritising her grandsons after the loss of their mother. She had to change tack, as her role as a grandmother and her role as queen pulled her in different directions.\nFor weeks, we've heard criticism that the Palace has lost the narrative, that the royal brand had taken a battering. It's clearly been difficult to manage the demands of the nation and the demands of the family - and Catherine's health news casts fresh light on why she hadn't been seen, until very recently.\nHer video and the communications around it have brought praise from those who understand how palace PR works.\nFormer Sun editor Stuart Higgins, who is also a cancer patient, applauded Catherine's \"enormous courage, dignity and composure to face the camera\" instead of letting Kensington Palace issue a message on her behalf.\nRevealing a cancer diagnosis is a \"very personal decision and only she and her closest family can make such a big decision to go public with such a health bombshell\", he said.\nMr Higgins said he did not believe the media furore around Catherine pushed her to disclose her diagnosis, but only reflected \"massive concern, love and respect for a woman who will be our future Queen\".\n\"I think we should all wish her well and look forward to seeing her when she feels ready to see us,\" he said.\nCharles Anson, former press secretary to Elizabeth II, told the BBC that \"getting the right sort of sequence of information is a very difficult thing to do in the internet age\". But the princess's video \"was absolutely right in terms of telling the public at the same time as creating a bit of an area of protection for the family\".\nBut there's no doubt there has been real shock at how virulent and unkind social media and some global media outlets have been over the past months. As several people with an understanding of Palace public relations put it to me, it's been the worst example of it ever.\nPR guru Mark Borkowski says communications for the royals is \"the most difficult job in the world\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 you have good days and bad days\", but that the princess' statement \"settles everything for a moment\".\n\"They've managed to take back control.\" The Princess of Wales's video has prompted a huge outpouring of love and sympathy across the UK and further.",

On most occasions, the scheme has been in surplus, and scheme members have received bonuses in addition to their guaranteed pension.\"\n'Deep unfairness'\nIn April 2021 a cross-party committee of MPs said the government should stop taking money from the scheme and pay back some of what it had already received.\nMinisters rejected those recommendations and data released to the BBC under Freedom of Information laws shows the government has received three annual payments of \u00c2\u00a3142.4m since then.\nWhile many schemes are overseen by the Pensions Regulator, the piece of law which led to this agreement means the government has sole responsibility.\nLabour's shadow energy security and net zero secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC there has been \"deep unfairness and injustice\" in the Conservative Party's approach to the arrangement.\nHe said a Labour government would carry out a \"comprehensive revision of the arrangements to make sure that miners get the fair share of the money to which they are entitled\".\nEnergy minister Graham Stuart said in December that the government had received \u00c2\u00a34.8bn from the pension scheme since 1994.\nThe business and trade select committee, which published the recommendations in April 2021, said the government should pay back \u00c2\u00a31.2bn of what it had previously received.\nThe committee said the government \"failed to conduct due diligence\" when it negotiated the arrangement, which it described as \"not proportionate\".\nIt recommended that the government should stop taking funds out of the scheme unless it fell into deficit and public money was needed to shore it up.\nAt the time. the committee said the changes it was recommending would give a \u00c2\u00a314 increase to the average weekly pension of \u00c2\u00a384.\nEarlier this month, the BBC reported on claims that former coal-mining areas are falling further behind the rest of Britain.\nForty years after the 1984 miners' strike, a survey commissioned by the BBC suggested almost three quarters of people living in former mining towns and villages felt they had seen little or no progress in government efforts to reduce regional inequalities.",

It said the rise in claims for personal independence payment (Pip), the non-means tested benefit for those with health issues, were \"most striking\", with claims rising 68% from 2020 to 2024.\nIn the 16-17 age range, new Pip claims had increased by 138%.\nThe Foundation said it would lead to \"wider strains on the NHS and welfare spending if we fail to improve the nation's health and reduce economic inactivity\".\nIt also examined the DWP's data on medical conditions recorded on Work Capability Assessments and highlighted the fact that many benefit claimants cited mental health problems and musculoskeletal problems.\nIt said 69% claimed for mental health disorders, and 48% had problems with connective or musculoskeletal pain.\nA spokesperson for the DWP said: \"Our plan for the economy is working. Inflation [the rate at which prices rise] is down to 3.4%, employment is up, the number of people on payrolls is at a record high, and inactivity is falling.\n\"We've reduced the number of workless households by one million since 2010. Our \u00c2\u00a32.5 billion Back to Work plan will help break down barriers to work for over a million more people and our recent Budget measures are estimated to boost the labour force by an extra 300,000 workers.\"\nIn order to deal with long-term economic inactivity, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said in November that reforms including stricter fit-to-work tests and jobseeker support would get 200,000 more people into work. Under those plans, the government also wants to scrap the controversial Work Capability Assessment.\n\"We will reform the work capability assessment to reflect greater flexibility and availability of home working after the pandemic,\" Mr Hunt said in November. \"And we will spend \u00c2\u00a31.3bn over the next five years to help nearly 700,000 people with health conditions find jobs.\"\nThe Foundation's latest report comes after it said in February that people in their early 20s are more likely to be not working due to ill health than those in their early 40s.\nResponding to the report, Shazia Ejaz at the Recruitment and Employment Federation (REC), which represents the recruitment industry, said long NHS waiting lists \"are a big factor for why not enough people are well enough to work\".\nShe added: \"Better infrastructure around transport, childcare and social care will all help tackle the inactivity challenge the UK faces\".",
    "More than 1.5 million women in the UK are believed to have endometriosis. The symptoms of the gynaecological condition can include painful periods, nausea, extreme tiredness and infertility. But recent research suggests it is taking longer than ever for women to get a diagnosis. BBC Sheffield's Ellie Colton shares her story.\nI started my period at 11 and it lasted for two weeks.\nI was in excruciating pain but I thought nothing of it - it hadn't happened before so to me this was normal.\nTwelve months later when I was in Year Seven, a science teacher told me a period should actually last for between three and five days.\nWhen I asked \"what if it lasts longer?\" her response was \"it shouldn't do\".\nThat was the extent of my education about endometriosis at school.\nSince then I've learnt a lot about endo - I've had to. It's been part of my life practically every day since.\nIf you don't have it, then you know someone who does. About one in 10 women will suffer with it, studies say.\n'Common story'\nThe thing about so many people having something should mean that it's well known and easy to identify and treat.\nThat's not the case with endo. Since the pandemic, research suggests the average length of time to get a diagnosis in England has gone up .\nIt was eight years, now it's eight years and 10 months - yes, the best part of a decade.\nMy story is a common one. It took me years to get the right help.\nWhen I was 15 I got diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes bloating, chronic fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, sickness, hot flushes, rashes, abdominal pain, joint swelling and back and leg pain.\nBut I knew something else was also wrong with me.\nI switched to a gluten-free diet but I still felt horrendous every day.\nIn the end I had to do my own research and when I put my symptoms plus heavy, painful and long periods together endo was the only diagnosis I could give myself.\nHopeful of answers and treatment to take the pain away, I went to the GP.\nI was prescribed the pill to \"manage my symptoms\".\nThis is a shared experience throughout the endo community - those diagnosed just get contraceptives and hormone therapies rammed down their throat.\nBut for the majority of people, myself included, it doesn't work, it feels like a way of making us go away rather than our condition.\nAs I got older my symptoms didn't improve.\nIn response, I tried the mini pill, the combined pill, coming off contraception and then the IUD implant. Nothing worked - if anything, it made my symptoms worse.\nDuring this period I genuinely have no idea how I had the energy to walk up the stairs. It left me empty.\nYou might wonder \"why didn't you get it taken out?\". I tried but the GPs kept sending me to the sexual health clinic, saying my bleeding must be due to an infection.\nBy the time I was 19 I was absolutely burnt out by my symptoms.\nDismissed by doctors, not referred to endo at the hospital, told to go back on the pill - whilst I had my IUD in - to manage my bleeding. I was pumped full of hormones and feeling worse than ever, with no clarity.\nI knew I had endometriosis, but no-one believed me.\nI went back to the GP when I was 20 and I said I wasn't leaving until I got referred to gynaecology at the hospital.\nI never believed I'd be dismissed there too - but it happened. I was given an ultrasound and told me I had some cysts on my ovaries, but this was normal, and it was unlikely I have endometriosis.\nThe only way to get a diagnosis of endometriosis is with a diagnostic laparoscopy, where a surgeon examines you using a keyhole method to see what's going on.\nI was put on a waiting list. I was living on painkillers, peppermint tea and had permanent burn scars on my stomach from pushing a hot water bottle on it every night.\nIn September 2022, I had my operation. Guess what they found?\nIt showed I had Stage 3 endometriosis - there are four stages, Stage 1 being a small amount and Stage 4 being the most there can be.\nI was told I had something that no-one wants yet I was so relieved I burst into tears when the surgeon told me. They even had photos to show me.\nEndometriosis looks like little brown spots and I had lots all over my womb.\nDuring the surgery I had a procedure called ablation, which is where they try and burn as much endo off as possible.\nBut there is no cure for the disease, and it grows back.\nPost-surgery I was told I could have the IUS or Mirena coil, which releases hormones into the womb, to manage symptoms, be put into temporary menopause, or consider a hysterectomy.\nAs a 25-year-old woman, I was gobsmacked those were my choices. I declined.\nI interviewed Madeleine Lake, also from Sheffield, about her endo as part of my work at the BBC.\nShe's a young woman like me and she started having symptoms when she was 13 - with a year-long period.\nShe told me how it had affected her as she grew up: \"I've had really severe abdomen pains, back pain, pain during sex, and feeling extremely fatigued when I'm supposed to be on my period as w",
    "The BBC needs to spend as much on television content in Wales as it does in Scotland, a new Senedd report says.\nThe culture committee said the BBC spends twice as much on Scotland English-language content as in Wales.\nWelsh licence fee payers \"deserve better,\" it said.\nThe BBC said Wales benefitted from moving more production out of London, it is Wales' biggest year of drama, and audiences are up for Welsh content on iPlayer, Sounds and news online.\n\"We're calling for a year-on-year increase in spending until we have parity with Scotland,\" said culture committee chair Delyth Jewell.\n\"Broadcasting plays an important role in Wales - portraying and shaping Welsh identity,\" she added.\n\"It also plays a key role in our democracy, ensuring that governments and decision-makers are held to account,\" she said.\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"The report highlights the BBC's continued commitment to audiences in Wales and to the Welsh creative economy. \u00c2\n\"It demonstrates the corporation's increased investment in content which is made in Wales and how the nation is benefiting from the decision to move more production out of London. \u00c2\n\"This year, investment in network radio produced in Wales has doubled.

    "A black Uber Eats driver has received a payout after \"racially discriminatory\" facial-recognition checks prevented him accessing the app to secure work.\nWhen Pa Edrissa Manjang began working for Uber Eats, in November 2019, its app did not regularly ask him to send selfies in order to register for jobs.\nBut the Microsoft-powered Uber Eats app increased these verification checks.\nAnd in 2021, it said after \"careful consideration\" his account would be removed, due to \"continued mismatches\".\n'Racial harassment'\nAn Uber representative said: \"Our real-time ID check is designed to help keep everyone who uses our app safe and includes robust human review to make sure that we're not making decisions about someone's livelihood in a vacuum, without oversight.\"\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission and the App Drivers and Couriers Union funded Mr Manjang's case.\nThe EHRC was concerned the artificial intelligence in the facial-recognition checks had deprived him of his income.\nThe ADCU said the number of selfies Mr Manjang had been asked for amounted to racial harassment.\nThe union told BBC News it was \"working hard\" to ensure workers' rights were protected as \"the pace of development of AI and machine-learning tools in the workplace accelerates\".\n'Opaque processes'\nMr Manjang, who was reinstated and continues to work for Uber Eats, in Oxfordshire, said the out-of-court settlement marked the end of a \"long and difficult\" period for him.\nHis case \"shines a spotlight\" on the potential problems with AI, particularly for \"low-paid workers in the gig economy\".\nAnd he hoped the decision would help strengthen \"rights and protections of workers in relation to AI, particularly ethnic minorities\".\nBaroness Falkner, who chairs the EHRC, said Mr Manjang should never have have had to sue Uber Eats to understand the opaque processes affecting his work.\n\"We are particularly concerned that Mr Manjang was not made aware that his account was in the process of deactivation, nor provided any clear and effective route to challenge the technology,\" she said.\nMicrosoft has previously admitted its facial-recognition software works less well for people belonging to ethnic minorities.\nAnd previous cases, involving the police, Home Office and universities, have shown ethnicity can affect the technology.",

    "When Florida resident Gerard thinks of his wife and two small children back home in Haiti, two words immediately come to mind: \"Permanent stress.\"\nGerard, who lives near Fort Lauderdale, is one of the more than half a million Haitians that call Florida home - the largest concentration in the US.\nMany say they are now gripped by fear and uncertainty for family still there amid worsening gang violence.\nFederal and state officials have been periodically evacuating US citizens.\nDozens of people have been killed and at least 17,000 left homeless since well-armed gangs attacked police stations and the country's main airport in Port-au-Prince on 29 February.\nThe gangs also stormed two of the country's largest prisons, releasing about 4,000 inmates.\nGerard - who asked that his surname not be used to protect his family in Haiti - told the BBC that he is constantly worried about the security of his wife and two children, aged seven and nine, who stayed in Haiti when he returned to live in the US several months ago.\n\"My biggest fear is that my house will be attacked by gangs. That is why I live in permanent stress,\" he said. \"Over there, everybody is fearing for their lives and possessions. Now the gangs go inside people's houses and steal everything, and the police are not able to protect them.\"\n\"I'm hopeless because I don't see a solution to the problem,\" Gerard added. \"And I'm disgusted with politicians that have made the country what it is now.\"\nAnother Florida-based Haitian, church pastor Dr Wadler Jules, said that members of his congregation are \"wondering if someone in their family has been kidnapped or killed\" in Haiti, where he said people \"live at the mercy of the gangs\".\n\"The members of our community live in fear, live in despair,\" said Dr Jules, whose church is in Miami's Little Haiti neighbourhood. \"You don't know if your loved ones are going to be alive tomorrow.

    "A mother who was fatally stabbed in the eye by her boyfriend was failed by agencies, a coroner has said.\nFormer airline flight attendant Michaela Hall, 49, from Mount Hawke, Cornwall, was killed by Lee Kendall on 31 May 2021.\nKendall, 45, an alcoholic and former drug addict, was jailed for life with a minimum 21-year term for her murder.\nCornwall coroner Andrew Cox said \"shortcomings and errors\" by probation services happened before her death.\nMr Cox said in a narrative conclusion that Ms Hall had been unlawfully killed.\nMs Hall had been attacked by Kendall on multiple occasions before her death, the inquest in Truro heard.\nThey had met in April 2019 when Ms Hall, who was then a charity support worker, had visited Kendall in prison.\nA relationship started and after Kendall was released a number of attacks by him on Ms Hall were reported to police.\nThey led to him being recalled to prison and he was released in July 2020 only to keep up the attacks, being arrested 10 times by police, the inquest heard.\n'Wrongly assessed'\nIn April 2021, Kendall admitted two assaults on Ms Hall and in May was given a three-year community order.\nA few weeks later Ms Hall was dead.\nMr Cox told the inquest that probation services had \"wrongly assessed as medium\" the risk of serious harm posed by Kendall.\nThat meant management of Kendall was by local probation services rather than the national Probation Service and that was \"inappropriate\", he said.\nProbation services had been sent a file on Kendall after he was released from prison, the inquest heard previously.\nBut a probation officer had only a \"cursory glance\" at the papers before going on holiday and when she returned Ms Hall was dead, the inquest heard.\n\"Had the shortcomings and errors not occurred it is more likely than not that Ms Hall would not have died when she did,\" said Mr Cox.\n'Blinkered perspective'\nHe also said a care order meant that both Ms Hall's children had been removed from her home for their protection against Kendall.\n\"This is blinkered perspective because Kendall was equally a danger to Ms Hall,\" said Mr Cox.\n\"More could and should have been done.\n\"With the dangers Kendall posed why did children's services not refer her to adult services?\"\nHe also questioned why children's services had not sent a high risk referral case to the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (Marac).\nIt includes local police, probation, health, child protection, housing practitioners, independent domestic violence advisors and other specialists from the statutory and voluntary sectors.\n'Holistic approach'\n\"It must have been apparent to the agencies the danger that Ms Hall was in,\" he said.\n\"There is a need for a more rounded or holistic approach.\"\nMs Hall had called a friend earlier on the day she died and her friend heard the attack on her by Kendall.\nShe called charity Crimestoppers who called police and two officers went to her home and left after no answer.\n\"She was already dead or dying by the time of the officers' arrival,\" said the coroner.\n'Rose-tinted glasses'\nOfficers went the next day, on 1 June and also had no reply.\nOfficers went again in the evening but there was no answer.\nPolice got a call later from Ms Hall's mother who was also concerned about her.\nLater a neighbour called police to say Ms Hall's father had found her dead at the house.\nOne policeman said they did not enter the house because everything looked in order and felt that no-one was home.\nMr Cox said because of Kendall's risk to Ms Hall, \"officers must be sure\" to see the alleged victim.\n\"If this means some doors may be damaged, then so be it,\" he said.\nMr Cox said police had made six referrals to Marac saying Ms Hall was at high risk from Kendall.\n\"In my view the police did what they could with the tools available to them,\" he said.\nThe inquest heard that Ms Hall chose to be with Kendall of her own free will.\nA social worker said Ms Hall \"saw things through rose-tinted glasses\".\nAnother social worker said Ms Hall \"seemed to be in [a] sort of pipe dream\" and thought that all would be well.\n'Horrific crime'\nMr Cox pointed out that \"no health-related inquiries appear to have been undertaken\" into Ms Hall who had shown signs of autism.\nThe coroner said he would send a number of prevention of future death reports.\nHe said he would release who and where they were sent in due course.\nMr Cox added Ms Hall was \"far too young to have died in these circumstances\" and asked those involved to \"reflect on the lessons that come out of this investigation\" and \"we do our utmost to prevent similar deaths in the future\".\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it was a

    "An MP has received an apology after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) failed to properly update a press release after stating she had \"made a threat to throw acid\".\nClaudia Webbe, independent MP for Leicester East, was convicted of harassing a woman in 2021 and later lost an appeal against the ruling.\nThe Court of Appeal, however, found she had not made a threat to throw acid, as her trial originally heard.\nBut the CPS did not issue this update.\nThe former Labour MP was found guilty of harassing Michelle Merritt, who was having a sexual relationship with her then partner, between September 2018 and April 2020.\nIn May 2022, an appeal judge said the court found Webbe had not \"made a threat to throw acid over\" Ms Merritt, but that a string of silent phone calls and threats to reveal naked pictures of her \"amounted to harassment\".\nA 10-week suspended prison sentence she received in November was also reduced to community service.\nThe CPS had originally published a press release, which reflected what was ruled at the trial.

If convicted, they could be jailed for up to a year.\nThe socks ran into controversy two weeks ago, with some calling for a boycott of the chain.\nKK Super Mart and their Malaysian supplier, Xin Jian Chang, had apologised. The store also took them off the shelves.\nBut the controversy continued as photos of the socks sparked a backlash online and drew criticism from Malaysia's king and political leaders.

But Islam is the country's official religion and Malay-Muslims make up more than two-thirds of its 34 million people.\nLast week, Malaysia's king, Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar, condemned Mr Chai's chain and called for \"stern action\" against those responsible: \"Blunders in relation to religious and race issues such as these are unacceptable,\" he said in what was seen as a rare rebuke from the palace.\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim called for \"firm action\" while urging people \"not [to] continue discussing it as a massive disaster\".\nKK Mart is a successful Malaysian chain that runs hundreds of stores across the country.

    "A police, fire and crime commissioner has announced he will not stand again after receiving unprecedented criticism from the head of his fire and police services, unions, fellow Conservatives and opposition politicians.\nHow did it go so wrong for Stephen Mold, and where does that leave Northamptonshire's police officers, firefighters and the public?\nWho is Stephen Mold?\nThe Conservative was elected the county's police and crime commissioner in 2016.\nIn 2019, he was one of a handful of commissioners to take on responsibility for their local fire service as well, and his position became police, fire and crime commissioner (PFCC).\nVoted for by the public, he holds the police force and the fire service to account.\nThe PFCC hires and dismisses the chief constable and the chief fire officer, and sets the budgets for both organisations.\nMr Mold was re-elected in 2021 with 53% of the first preference vote on a turnout of about 35%.\nWhere did it start to go wrong?\nThe Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has not supported the idea of a commissioner overseeing a fire service.\nBut it was particularly critical of Mr Mold's decision to appoint Mark Jones as chief fire officer, claiming he was \"divisive\" during his time as chief of the fire service in Buckinghamshire .\nMr Jones took over in Northamptonshire in October 2022, but left in July 2023 saying that he had to concentrate on recovering from injuries.\nIt was on the eve of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, one of the biggest events for the service.\nAs his replacement, Nicci Marzec was appointed chief fire officer on an interim basis.\nThe move was widely criticised , primarily by the FBU, because she had no operational firefighting experience and had been working in the PFCC's office as director of early intervention and head of paid service.\nThere was also criticism about the fact the pair were already friends.\nShe stepped down from her role on 17 July, just 10 days after she was appointed.\nSimon Tuhill, who was due to start work as the deputy chief fire officer on 18 July, found himself propelled straight into the chief fire officer's role on an interim basis, becoming the third person to lead the service in the space of a month.\nIn September, Mr Mold survived a vote of no confidence in his leadership at a meeting of the Police, Fire and Crime Panel, which is made up of politicians and lay members.\nBut later that month, 27 Conservative councillors signed a letter saying he should not be the party's candidate for the post at the next election.\nInvestigations and a suspension\nIn October 2023, Chief Constable Nick Adderley, who Mr Mold had recently reappointed , was suspended during an investigation into his conduct over the wearing of military medals.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it was investigating offences of misconduct in public office and fraud by false representation.\nAs far as the fire service was concerned, in November the PFCC announced that his preferred candidate for chief fire officer was Nikki Watson.\nConcerns were immediately raised about her lack of experience of firefighting, as she had spent the previous 36 years working with police forces, including in Avon & Somerset.\nIt later emerged that she, too, was under investigation by the IOPC .\nThe IOPC confirmed that a senior officer from Avon & Somerset Police was under investigation regarding their attendance at a policing conference in 2023 and whether proper policies and procedures were followed.\nThe Police, Fire and Crime Panel confirmed Ms Watson's appointment , despite some members of the panel receiving large numbers of representations from firefighters and the public calling on her to be rejected.\nThen, earlier this month the NN Journal reported that Mr Mold used a derogatory term for Ms Watson during a meeting at Moulton fire station.\nHe apologised, saying he \"immediately regretted\" the words he had used, but at least two Conservative councillors made complaints to their party .\nHe was also criticised by fellow Tory Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez de Savage during a Police, Fire and Crime Panel later that day.\nPressure began to mount on Mr Mold, with criticism both from within his own party and from the Labour and Liberal Democrat PFCC candidates.\nAt 17:00 GMT on Friday 15 March, he announced he would not seek re-election .\nCriticism continues\nDespite saying he would stand down, he continued to receive more criticism, including from the National Police Chief's Council , who called his comments \"abhorrent and unacceptable\".\nThe Police Federation said it had received \"unprecedented feedback\" from members and asked Mr Mold to stay away from its events that it had \"planned around misogyny\".\nActing Chief Constable Ivan Balhatchet said it was \"a disgraceful episode which has let down our officers and staff, particularly our female workforce, and deeply offended the wider public\".\nMr Tuhill, the acting chief fire officer, said Mr Mold's comments were \"hurtful and damaging\", while the FBU called for",
    "Exactly 30 years ago, a little-known band called Oasis set out on their first headline tour, playing to small crowds in tiny venues. Many of those venues say they're now struggling and it's harder for new bands to take the same path today.\nWhen Mark Davyd was asked to book a gig by a rising Scottish band called Whiteout at his venue in Kent in March 1994, he wasn't keen when he found out that an unfamiliar Mancunian group would also be on the bill.\n\"Whiteout were, at that time, much more the hotly tipped act,\" Davyd recalls.\nHe wanted to put on a local support act instead - but the agent stressed it was a joint headline tour.\n\"We eventually begrudgingly agreed that Oasis would be a joint headline. But I insisted that they must go on first.\"\nSo Oasis played the Tunbridge Wells Forum - a 250-capacity converted toilet block - on the third date of their first proper tour.\n\"It wasn't sold out, but it wasn't empty by a long chalk,\" Davyd says.\nThe Gallagher brothers exceeded his expectations. \"They were good. But I genuinely can't honestly tell you that the reaction in the room on the night was, 'Wow, that's the future of rock 'n' roll.'.\"\nIt turned out Oasis were the next big thing - and went from playing Tunbridge Wells to headlining Glastonbury the following year, and making history at Knebworth the year after that.\nDavyd's reluctance to book them is \"funny in retrospect\", he says.\nFor those early venues, it has become increasingly difficult to make ends meet three decades later.\n\"On that night 30 years ago, that show - with the door take and the bar - probably made a little bit of money,\" Davyd says.\n\"You could not afford to put on a similar show now featuring two new bands. You will definitely lose money. Even if you sold all 250 tickets, you'd lose money.\"\nTicket prices and bar takings haven't kept pace with rising fees, bills, rent and wages, he explains.\n'Totally different now'\n\"It's been getting worse every year and the final nail in this coffin was the extraordinary increase in energy bills, services and supplies, and rent particularly,\" Davyd says.\nToday, the surviving venues can often only afford to put on new acts because they also stage other events, like tribute bands and club nights, which do make a profit, they say.\nDavyd set up the Music Venue Trust (MVT) 10 years ago to champion the cause of the grassroots circuit, and will be among the industry figures giving evidence about the health of the scene to a parliamentary committee on Tuesday.\nThe MVT's latest annual report said almost 150 members either shut or stopped staging live music in 2023, while 34 new venues joined.\nThe first Oasis tour kicked off on 23 March 1994 at Bedford's Angel pub, which was demolished several years later.\nOf the 15 venues on the original tour poster, nine have closed or stopped hosting gigs over the years.\nThe surviving venues include Southampton Joiners, where the Gallagher brothers' rivalry was already rearing its head, according to folklore that has been passed down to current boss Ricky Bates.\n\"About 15 minutes in, Liam and Noel started having a bickering fight on stage. They ended up playing about a half an hour, and then I think Noel or Liam stormed off. I'm not sure which.\"\nRunning a venue is \"totally different now\", and has got tougher even since the Covid pandemic, Bates says.\nAlong with rising costs, fewer bands are touring - especially since Brexit, which has meant higher costs and red tape for international acts, he says. Those that do go on tour often aren't on the road for as long and only visit the biggest cities.\n'On the breadline'\nAlso, the cost of living crisis means fewer people are going to gigs, and those that do spend less at the bar.\nThere have been other culture shifts, too.\nYoung people go out less, guitar bands have gone out of fashion, and many up-and-coming artists make their names on TikTok rather than the live circuit.\n\"There are a lot of factors,\" Bates says. \"We've always been on the brink of closure, as a lot of venues are across the country. A lot of venues run pay cheque to pay cheque.\"\nSeveral years ago, the Joiners started promoting gigs in bigger venues in Southampton, and that revenue has been a lifeline.\n\"If we weren't doing that, I imagine the Joiners would have closed in 2015 or 2016.\n\"It lives on the breadline, and just when you think, if we don't get a big show in the next couple of weeks we're going to close down, something mysteriously appears.\n\"And then that one show tides us over again for another couple of weeks. Every day is a flip flop of a situation.\"\nThe night after playing Southampton, Oasis moved on to Bristol. Next Saturday, on the 30th anniversary of that show, tribute band Oas-is will perform at the same venue.\nIn fact, fans can relive the original gig regularly - Oas-is play at the Fleece seven times a year.\n\"They always sell out. Always,\" Fleece owner Chris Sharp says. \"And the bar [money] is great. You're taking \u00c2\u00a35,000 or \u00c2\u00a36,000 on the bar. That's our buf",
    "The Times reports that an urgent investigation has begun into prison security after one of its undercover journalists was hired at one of the country's most dangerous jails.\nThe paper says he was able to walk inside and interact with prisoners without security searches. In an editorial, the paper says the expos\u00c3\u00a9 of HMP Bedford suggests \"a system near to the point of breakdown\" which should be a \"wake up call for politicians and the public\". The Ministry of Justice says all jail staff and visitors were \"regularly and randomly searched\".\nThe Guardian focuses on the criticism faced by water companies in England after data revealed raw sewage was discharged for more than 3.6 million hours into rivers and seas last year. An unnamed water company executive tells the paper, \"we have wasted 15 years, we haven't invested enough\".\nThe Daily Telegraph says campaigners have accused the Environment Agency of being an \"apologist\" for water firms after it said the record sewage spills were the result of wet weather. The i says environmentalists point the finger at Labour because they think the party's proposals, if it wins the general election, to fine water bosses and block bonuses are \"feeble gestures\".\nThe Times leads on a joint article for the paper by the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner. The pair say the Conservatives were \"starting to understand\" the problems that cause regional inequality but they accuse Rishi Sunak of killing the levelling up policy at birth. The paper says the intervention represents an attempt to exploit Tory divisions, as Labour prepares to launch its local election campaign today.\n\"Could Rishi gamble on a summer election?\" asks the Daily Mail . The paper says the prime minister's aides are urging him to hold a general election as early as June, amid fears Tory rebels will step up their plotting and lodge no confidence votes against him. Asked about the prime minister's refusal to call a vote on the second of May when people will vote in the local elections in England, Ms Rayner tells the Daily Mirror Mr Sunak \"wants one last summer with his beloved helicopter\".\nThe Daily Telegraph carries a photo of the King , dressed in a suit, recording his Easter message at his desk in Buckingham Palace. The paper says he has been regularly photographed working at home, and is preparing to attend an Easter Sunday service at Windsor Castle under what it calls \"modified conditions.\" The Daily Express says the Prince and Princess of Wales and their three children will not be joining, as they focus on Catherine's recovery.\nAccording to the Sun, being overweight really is in your DNA . It quotes researchers as saying that out of 3,000 adults all \"normal weight\" at the start of a study, 43% deemed genetically at risk became obese over the following five years.

    "When Leanne Fraser gave birth to her son, Henry, she never imagined she would miss the first few days of his life.\nThe first-time mum from Malton in North Yorkshire had been in hospital for an emergency c-section, when, following the birth, she started to feel \"excruciating\" pain in her head.\nAlthough she could hear everything going on, she lost the ability to speak and was eventually transferred to the stroke ward.\nWhat Leanne thought was a \"bad reaction to anaesthetic\" turned out to be functional neurological disorder (FND), a rare condition that has now changed her life for more than two years.\nPreparing to mark FND Awareness Day 2024 on Monday 25 March, Leanne, now 31, told BBC Radio York: \"I went into hospital to have my baby boy and I came out as a completely different person.\"\n\"It was terrifying. I'd just had my little baby boy and then I was away from him,\" she added.\n\"I missed his first few days and I knew how precious they were. You can't get them back.\"\nToday, due to FND, Leanne faces memory loss, tremors, fatigue and sometimes facial spasms on a regular basis.\n\"I still have seizures, which are during the night, and they happen once or twice a week,\" she said.\nThe seizures used to occur more often and in the daytime, she said, but the unpredictable nature of FND meant they could easily come back.\n\"They were extremely frightening. I would just drop down in the middle of a conversation and sometimes injure myself and knock my head.\"\nDuring the seizures, she would become unconscious and \"extremely vulnerable\", meaning that looking after Henry alone was not possible for months.\nThe memory loss that followed her seizures could also \"wipe a whole day out\", Leanne said.\nLeanne said she was not aware of FND before she was diagnosed by a neurologist, and even health care professionals struggle to diagnose the condition.\n\"If you imagine your body as a computer, the hardware is fine, so your body on scans looks to be intact with no damage,\" she explained.\n\"But it's a problem with your software, so the programme that's running on the computer isn't working properly.\"\nLeanne's diagnosis and the symptoms that came with it meant her confidence was shattered. She developed a stutter and lost a lot of her independence.\nShe said: \"The speech, for me, was just such a massive shock to the system.\n\"I've worked from the age of 17 and in every job I've had, I always had perfect speech.\n\"I used to love spending time with friends, making jokes and joining in, but when my speech became so stuttered, I just stopped trying to join in.\n\"By the time I'd said it, the moment had passed - and that knocked my confidence.\"\nHowever, Leanne said she did finally reach a turning point with her speech, which she playfully credited to singer Peter Andre.\n\"One day, Henry was listening to his songs and Peter Andre's Mysterious Girl came on.\n\"I started singing it and realised my speech wasn't as stuttered.\n\"A few hours later, I was singing it in my head and I said something to my husband and it was perfect.\n\"Now, anytime I want to talk, I sing in my head, so at the minute, I'm singing a song and talking to you.\n\"It works. I don't know why, but it just works.\"\n'Silver lining'\nHowever, in terms of her movement, things have deteriorated for Leanne.\nShe now needs a walking aid to move around her home and a wheelchair when she is out and about.\n\"I am grateful to have the wheelchair, but sometimes I'm sat in it and wish I could run around with my little boy,\" she admitted.\n\"We go for days out sometimes and it just hurts my heart that I can't join in.\"\nThe support of her husband and her parents means Leanne can be the best mum possible for Henry, but she said she recognised that other people with FND would not have the same support system.\n\"At the start, I did think I came out a completely different person, but I now think I went into hospital as me and I came out as a mum to a gorgeous and healthy baby boy,\" Leanne said.\n\"My whole perspective has changed, I try every day to look for positives and a silver lining.\"\nGetting ready for FND Awareness Day, Leanne said she hoped the condition would become \"better recognised and understood\".\n\"Hopefully, one day, there won't be as much pain and the seizures will have stopped completely,\" she added.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Former President Jacob Zuma has been barred from running in South Africa's general election in May.\nThe country's electoral commission, or IEC, has not given a reason.\nHowever, his 2021 conviction and jailing for contempt of court would appear to disqualify him.\nHis backing of the new uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) party has been seen as a possible threat to the governing African National Congress (ANC), which has suspended Mr Zuma.\nThe 81-year-old served as president from 2009 until 2018, when he had to step down because of corruption allegations.\nMr Zuma's new party is named after the ANC's former military wing, and he sees himself as the true heir to the governing party's revolutionary roots.\nThe ANC had wanted South Africa's electoral body to deregister MK, but that request was rejected on Tuesday.\nMr Zuma has been leading the MK party's campaign and was the first name on their candidate list, but the electoral commission received objections to him potentially becoming a member of the National Assembly.\nRather than voting directly for a president, South Africans elect members of the National Assembly. The head of whichever party can muster a  majority is likely to become the country's leader, though it could put forward another candidate.\n\"In the case of former President Zuma, yes, we did receive an objection, which has been upheld,\" said electoral commission head Mosotho Moepya on Thursday.\n\"The party that has nominated him has been informed,\" Mr Moepya told journalists.\nMr Zuma has until 2 April to appeal against the decision.\nMK spokesman Nhlamulo Ndlhela told AFP news agency the party was \"looking at the merit of that objection but we will of course appeal it\".\nThe former president received a 15-month prison sentence in 2021 for contempt of court and the constitution says anyone who has had a prison sentence of longer than 12 months is not eligible to run for election.\nMr Zuma is also facing charges of corruption over a multi-billion-dollar arms deal from the 1990s, when he was vice-president.\nThe IEC said that the ruling did not prevent the MK party from taking part in the 29 May poll, News24 reports.\nFor the first time since the start of the democratic era in 1994, the ANC's vote share could fall below 50%, according to several opinion polls. The MK party is seen as popular in Mr Zuma's home region of KwaZulu-Natal.\nMore about South Africa's election:",
    "Simon Harris is expected to become the new leader of Fine Gael.\nMr Harris, who is currently Ireland's minister for further and higher education, was the only candidate to seek the party leadership.\nHe is set to replace Leo Varadkar, who announced on Wednesday he was stepping down as party leader and taoiseach (Irish prime minister).\nNominations closed at 13:00 local time on Sunday.\nHe was the only candidate for the position at the close of nominations.\nHe is due to outline his key priorities in a speech later.\nA memo sent to Fine Gael politicians on Friday said the announcement of the party leader would be made at the conclusion of the party's Midlands North West European selection convention in Athlone on Sunday.\nIt added that if only one person is nominated, the returning officer will confirm that person as party leader.\nMr Harris has a clear run at the top job after other ministers who were viewed as potential competitors ruled themselves out.\nHe was the early favourite, with many backing the 37-year-old before nominations even opened.\nMinisters Helen McEntee, Paschal Donohoe and Heather Humphreys were among those to throw their support behind Mr Harris.\nSpeaking on Friday, Mr Harris said he was \"overwhelmed and honoured\" by the support he had received over the last few days.\nWhy is there a leadership contest?\nOn Wednesday, Mr Varadkar caused shock when he announced he would be stepping down as Fine Gael leader immediately, and would resign as taoiseach as soon as his successor was selected.\nHe said he was resigning for \"personal and political reasons\" and was \"not the best person for the job anymore\".\nHe also denied any \"conspiracy theories\" over the decision , telling reporters in Brussels there was no ulterior motive or new job on the cards.\nMr Varadkar's resignation paved the way for a party leadership contest, but as he heads the current coalition government alongside Fianna F\u00c3\u00a1il and the Green Party in Dublin, his successor is also expected to take over as taoiseach.\nWho is Simon Harris?\nAt 37, Mr Harris is set to make history as Ireland's youngest taoiseach - taking over the top role a year younger than his predecessor did in 2017.\nHe first entered the D\u00c3\u00a1il (lower house of Irish parliament) over a decade ago at the age of 24 as TD (MP) for Wicklow.\nMr Harris has had a rapid rise through the party ranks, landing his first cabinet role, as health minister, five years later in 2016.\nIn this role, he oversaw the Republic of Ireland's vote to overturn its abortion ban and the country's cervical cancer screening scandal .\nHe also oversaw the initial response to the Covid-19 pandemic, before he was replaced when the new coalition government formed in 2020.\nHe has since been minister for further and higher education, research, innovation and science, and briefly took on the justice portfolio.\nFine Gael Senator Emer Currie, the party's Northern Ireland spokesperson, described Mr Harris as part of a new generation of nationalist politicians \"not shy about their nationalist aspirations\".\n\"I think that he will also be very respectful of reconciliation politics,\" she told the BBC's Sunday Politics Programme.\n\"He is a very compassionate person and I think the empathy that he has, and understanding of victims of the north, I am very encouraged by.\n\"He will be somebody who is going to very much follow the reset of relationships post-Brexit and has a very keen understanding and respect for the Good Friday Agreement.\"\nSenator Currie also said the new party leader is \"very much interested in all-island issues\", in particular, giving Northern Irish students more opportunities to study in the Republic of Ireland.",
    "Household hoards of unused electricals and broken tech are growing, a recycling campaign group warns.\u00c2\nMaterial Focus estimates we've gone from stockpiling an average of 20 items to 30 within four years.\nIts findings come from market research. The top ten products include remote controls, mobile phones and hairdryers.\nWith the UN reporting that electronic waste is rising five times faster than documented recycling, we're being urged to clean out our \"drawers of doom\".\n\"I think back in the day my dad would have had a shed full of jars of screws, and the modern dad has a drawer full of 15 old mobiles,\" says Paul Bowtell, a self-proclaimed hoarder of electricals.\u00c2\nHe\u00c2\u00a0counted more than 40 electrical items in just a couple of his storage boxes.\nBut there's more, he admits, in the attic, drawers, a footstool and other boxes.\nThe Bristol dad says there are things he's looking after for his grown-up sons, and items which were once expensive and now hold no value, so it's hard to say goodbye.\u00c2\nScott Butler, executive director of Material Focus, says we've probably all got a \"drawer of doom\", which has \"got cables in there that we don't know what they're for: it's got a DVD remote for a DVD player that we lost a long, long time ago\".\nThe group - which runs an electricals recycling campaign and postcode search for householders to find drop off points - estimates over 880 million unused items are being held in UK homes. It warns trashed electronics should never go in the general waste.\n\"If you look at the electricals that we're throwing away and that we're holding onto [in the UK], we think over a \u00c2\u00a31bn billion in value of 'treasure', is sitting there untapped,\" says Scott Butler. \"That material is also quite crucial for the green technology future that we're aiming for.\"\nInside\u00c2\u00a0old\u00c2\u00a0laptops, electric toothbrushes and shavers\u00c2\u00a0is a trove including steel, aluminium, copper, lithium batteries\u00c2\u00a0and even gold.\u00c2\nJustin Greenaway, commercial manager of SWEEEP, a specialist household electrical recycling centre, says that whenever there's anything complicated going on inside a computer, with lots of data moving around, all the connections need to be finished with gold to stop the data becoming corrupted.\n\"Our process allows us to recover that gold and get it back into use again. Obviously if we don't capture it and it goes into landfill or incineration that gold is lost.\"\nMining such precious materials in the first place leads to pollution, harms wildlife and contributes to climate change, as extracting raw materials, followed by manufacturing them into products is very carbon intensive.\u00c2\n\"It's not just about recycling electricals... It's about getting the value out of them,\" Sarah Burns, the sustainability and engagement manager from Bristol Waste says. \"The first thing we would look to do is to reduce the electrical items in the first place.\"\nOne way of keeping unused electrical items in circulation to extend that value, is to share them.\nFor example, at Share Bristol - A Library of Things, instead of borrowing books you can borrow sanders, hedge trimmers and popcorn makers amongst other items you're unlikely to use every day.\nAnna Perry, one of the trustees, donated her jet washer to the scheme.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\n\"I knew that a jet washer would be well used and really popular, but I didn't think my jet washer would be used for 19 different projects by 19 different people,\" she explains.\u00c2\nEven redundant laptops can find new homes, once they've been wiped of data.\u00c2\n\"If you're lucky enough to have a spare laptop or smart device, search \"recycle your electricals\" and you'll see reuse and drop off points where people can donate to those in need,\" adds Scott Butler from Material Focus.\u00c2\nData from Material Focus suggests households are throwing away 103,000 tonnes of electricals, rather than recycling them.\nThe organisation also estimates that 343,000 tonnes of electrical waste is being stolen from within the waste system or illegally exported.\u00c2\nTo calculate the estimates on what we're holding onto, Material Focus used data from recent market research where 2,000 adults were polled across the UK by companies that are members of the British Polling Council.\u00c2",

    "The rural community is being asked about its interest in producing biomethane for direct injection to Northern Ireland's gas grid.\nA formal request for information been launched by the local gas network operators.\nIt follows the first direct-to-grid injection of the non-fossil fuel gas last year.\nUsing biomethane in Northern Ireland's modern gas grid is a key part of plans for decarbonising energy.\nThe more environmentally friendly fuel can be produced from manure, food waste and surplus agricultural feedstock like silage.\nThat means it can also help tackle Northern Ireland's manure surplus , a major challenge for agriculture which is the biggest local producer of greenhouse gas emissions.\nPotential and current producers of biomethane are now being asked to indicate whether they would supply direct to the grid.\nProducers of biogas who may be considering upgrading and repurposing their anaerobic digestion plants are also asked to respond.\nBiogas is treated to create biomethane by removing carbon dioxide and other pollutants which are then repurposed.\nThe five gas network operators - Phoenix Energy, Firmus Energy, Evolve, GNI (UK) and Mutual Energy - say the information they want to gather is key for forward planning to ensure the network can accommodate as much biomethane as possible.\n'Considerable potential'\n\"In recent years we have seen the pace at which the biomethane economy has developed across Europe,\" said Kailash Chada, chief executive of Phoenix Energy.\n\"This particular request for information initiative will be key to unlocking the considerable potential that exists in NI, contributing to near term carbon budget targets and providing an increased self-sufficiency and sustainability to our local energy supplies.\"\nThe five operators joined Minister for the Economy Conor Murphy and Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister Andrew Muir to launch the formal Request for Information.\nBoth ministers welcomed the step as an important element in developing a framework for the sustainable production of biomethane.",
    "Legal and consumer experts have expressed concerns about a cash giveaway by e-retailer, Temu.\nParticipants in the promotion - which has gone viral on social media - receive up to \u00c2\u00a350, but have to agree to permanently hand over considerable amounts of personal data.\nExperts say that is potentially \"problematic\". The data regulator says it is considering such concerns.\nBut Temu insists what it is doing is standard industry practice.\nTemu is a Chinese-owned online marketplace that launched in the US in 2022 and the UK last year.\nIt has been described as \"Amazon on steroids\" by retail experts and is known for selling goods at extremely cheap prices, using the slogan \"shop like a billionaire\".\nBut it has faced criticism from politicians, with a US government investigation finding an \"extremely high risk\" that products on Temu could have been made with forced labour .\nWhat is Temu's campaign?\nThe firm's giveaway gives new users 24 hours to sign up other people using a shareable link in order for them to each receive a cash reward of between \u00c2\u00a340 and \u00c2\u00a350 - paid to their PayPal accounts - or in Temu store credit.\nExisting Temu account holders can also participate, but appear to have to reach a higher threshold for such rewards.\nThousands of users eager to cash in on the promotion have been seen posting links across social media sites.\nBut it has also been the subject of memes and posts scrutinising the rules.\nThe section receiving the most scrutiny states that \"except to the extent prohibited by applicable law\", participants give the company consent to use and publish their \"photo, name, likeness, voice, opinions, statements, biographical information, and/or hometown and state\" for advertising or promotional purposes.\nIt adds this can take place in any media worldwide and \"in perpetuity\" - meaning with no fixed end date.\nOne such post on X (formerly Twitter) with screengrabs of the campaign's usage and publicity rules has been viewed more than two million times, according to the platform's metrics.\nA number of other X users claimed the rules would allow Temu to sell their data or even create deepfake adverts - though those claims have been strenuously denied by the retailer.\n\"Temu gathers user information solely for the purpose of delivering our service and to enhance customer experience,\"  the fast growing, Chinese-owned retailer told the BBC in a statement.\nA spokesperson for Temu said giveaways were commonplace across many firms and different industries - citing its e-commerce rival Shein as an example of a firm running promotions with \"nearly identical terms and conditions\".\n\"If these standard terms and conditions for run-of-the-mill promotional activities are newsworthy, then we urge you to be fair and report on their use by other companies instead of singling out Temu,\" they added.\nSensitive data\nExperts though have raised concerns about the terms of the promotion.\n\"Giving away permission for Temu to use your 'voice' and 'biographical information' will understandably concern its customers,\" said Lisa Webb, Which? consumer law expert.\n\"These offers are going viral on social media, including to young people, but consumers should definitely consider whether they are comfortable giving this sensitive data away in return for cash.\"\nShe added that \"while Temu isn't the first platform to excessively hoover up data, there are definite question marks over whether requesting permission for personal data to be used 'worldwide' is proportionate in any circumstances.\"\nJonathan Kirsop, data protection partner at law firm Pinsent Mason, told BBC News it was not a wording he had seen used commonly before and the activity implied may be \"problematic\".\nHe said it could fall foul of UK data protection rules, which require user consent to be freely given, specific and able to be withdrawn in order for it to be relied upon as a reason for data processing.\n\"While not always prohibited, making the provision of services conditional on a consent to the use of personal data will often be unlawful on the basis the user may not be considered to have a free choice in delivering that consent, particularly where the data concerned is sensitive, such as biometric data,\" he said.\nThe use of voice data - which is considered biometric data under the UK's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - has a higher threshold for lawful use and consent in the UK because it carries greater risks, he added.\nThe data regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, said it was \"aware of reports about Temu\" and was \"considering the concerns raised.\"\nIn a statement it added: \"Organisations must be clear and transparent about how and why they collect and use people's personal information, and ensure people can make a fully informed decision as to whether to hand over their data.\"\nAwais Rashid, professor of cyber security at the University of Bristol, told BBC News that apps collecting a lot of data - often more than they actually need from users - had ",

    "Condor Ferries CEO has admitted the lack of use of its newest ship led to financial difficulties last year.\nChristophe Mathieu, who is also CEO of Brittany Ferries, said buying the Islander was a \"worthwhile exercise but hasn't delivered\".\nBrittany Ferries has loaned Condor Ferries \u00c2\u00a310m to \"top up the company\" and cover unpaid port fees, according to Mr Mathieu.\nHe said the company was committed to the islands and \"isn't going anywhere\".\nThe company is set to revert its schedules to how they were before the Covid pandemic to \"reduce inconsistency\", Mr Mathieu said.\nIt will mean one fast ferry is based in Poole to service the UK-Channel Islands routes and the other will be based in St Malo, going to the Channel Islands.\nThe Condor Islander, which was purchased in partnership with Guernsey's States, will now do the routes currently serviced by the Clipper as part of changes to the company's schedule.\nThe States of Guernsey and Condor invested \u00c2\u00a33m in the boat and the States also lent the ferry company \u00c2\u00a326m, which is due to be paid back over a decade.\nResilience plan\nWhen asked whether Brittany Ferries branding could start being used on Condor Ferries vessels, Mr Mathieu said \"maybe\".\n\"We've not taken a decision on that, it's still early days. We want to convince the islands that we are the solution and the brand will come as a secondary question - the answer for now is we will be putting forward these new schedules for a successful season.\"\nHe announced the company was looking to provide more integration for customers when it came to fares, allowing people to travel on the same ticket from the Channel Islands to the UK and onwards to places like Ireland with Brittany Ferries.\n\"We want to offer those combined tickets which will provide a better deal than doing them on their own,\" Mr Mathieu said.\nEarlier this week Brittany Ferries trialled the\u00c2\u00a0Barfleur in St Helier's harbour .\u00c2\nTender process\nMr Mathieu said this was part of a resilience plan and he was not planning to use the boat regularly in the Channel Islands.\nHe did admit that in early 2025 the ship may be used to cover some sailings, if it was needed.\n\"It's a possibility that we schedule the Barfleur to cover dry dock when a ship is in for maintenance.\"\nAt the moment the States of Guernsey has a memorandum of understanding with Condor Ferries to run the island's ferry services, while the States of Jersey has a contract with the company until 2025.\nGuernsey's Economic Development Committee President Neil Inder told deputies last week a tender process to find the next ferry operator for the islands would be launched in April.\nMr Mathieu said: \"We are going to focus on this tender to convince everybody that we are the solution for the islands.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook and you can follow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook .

He later died in the freezing Atlantic, with his body falling into the depths of the ocean.\nIn a 2012 episode of Mythbusters, Titanic director James Cameron revealed he receives dozens of emails a day calling Rose \"selfish\" and Jack an \"idiot\" over the scene.\nBut he put an end to the debate, saying Jack had to die according to the script.\n\"Maybe we screwed up and the board should have been a tiny bit smaller, but the dude's going down,\" he said.\nThe prop, often mistaken for a door , was based on a complete piece of debris salvaged from the 1912 tragedy, according to auctioneers Heritage Auctions.\nAnd addressing the debate over whether the panel could have accommodate both, the listing states: \"The prop measures approx. 8' long (2.4m) and 41\" (1m) wide.\"\nOther props featured in the auction included the whip from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which sold for $525,000.\nA Spiderman suit worn by Toby Maguire sold for $125,000, while an axe used by Jack Nicholson in The Shining to hack through a bathroom door while announcing \"Here's Johnny!\" attracted the same amount.\nThe auction, which ended on Sunday evening, raised $15.68m, making it the one of the most successful sales of a prop and costume collection, Heritage Auctions said.\n\"There were countless bidding wars... so many we lost track,\" Joseph Maddalena, of Heritage, said.",

    "It is \"deeply regrettable\" that a new way of funding public services in Northern Ireland will not immediately reflect the level of need, MPs have concluded.\nThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has been investigating the funding and delivery of public services.\nIt looked at the government's financial package which accompanied the return of devolution.\nPart of that package was a new \"needs-based\" funding formula.\nNeeds-based funding recognises that it costs more to deliver public services in Northern Ireland to an equivalent standard to those provided in England.\nIndependent experts on the Northern Ireland Fiscal Council have estimated that Northern Ireland needs \u00c2\u00a3124 per head for every \u00c2\u00a3100 per head spent in England.\nNorthern Ireland is estimated to have now fallen below that level to about \u00c2\u00a3120 per head.\nThe government has said it will top up annual public funding in Northern Ireland by 24% as a way to get back to the assessed level of need.\nHowever, the Fiscal Council has warned that those top-ups will not bring Northern Ireland back to its level of need until about 2035.\nThe MPs said it was \"deeply regrettable\" that the proposal will only slowly lift Northern Ireland's funding to a point \"below which it should never have been permitted to fall in the first place\".\nThey add that a review of the exact calculation and assessment of the needs-based factor should be included as part of the terms of reference for upcoming negotiations between the government and Northern Ireland Executive.\nChair of the committee Sir Robert Buckland said the \"delay\" in Northern Ireland receiving the higher level of funding \"is going to have an appreciable effect on the way in which public services are delivered\".\n\"The matter should be rethought and reviewed,\" the Conservative MP told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster Programme.\nHowever, he also said that there was a need for reform and \"transformation\" in Northern Ireland's public services, which he added \"is the responsibility of the Executive primarily\".\n\"That nettle has to be grasped sooner or later,\" Sir Robert added.\nA Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said: \"In December 2023, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland offered a comprehensive financial package to the Northern Ireland parties for a restored executive.\n\"As part of the financial package HM Treasury has opened discussions with the executive on a fiscal framework.\n\"These discussions are ongoing.\"\nWhat does the NI Affairs Committee do?\nThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee examines the administration, spending and policy of the Northern Ireland Office.\nIt is currently comprised of 10 MPs and mainly works by carrying out inquiries into various issues.\nIt has the power to call witnesses to give oral evidence.",
    "Two former bankers found guilty of rigging key interest rates have had their appeal against their convictions dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nTom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were among 37 City traders prosecuted for manipulating rate benchmarks, Libor and Euribor.\nBoth men spent time in prison before being released in 2021.\nTheir case went before the Appeal Court after a judge in the US overturned similar convictions there.\nThe convictions hinged on whether the traders acted dishonestly by influencing the setting of key Libor and Euribor interest rates, or whether it was normal practice at the time.\nIn the original trial, Mr Hayes, who worked as a trader for UBS and then Citigroup, was described as the \"ringmaster\" of a plot to ensure Libor, a key interest rate, was set at levels that would benefit his own trades.\nMr Hayes, now 44, who has been diagnosed with autism, has spent the last nine years trying to overturn his conviction.\nHe succeeded in reducing his original 15-year jail sentence to 11 years, of which he served half.\nIn the US, rate rigging convictions, including for Mr Hayes, have been overturned after an appeal court said the US government had failed to provide evidence the traders had said anything false or broken any rules.\nThe cases of Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo were referred back to the UK Court of Appeal last year by the Criminal Cases Review Commission on the basis that the courts might prefer the view of the US judges.\nBut Lord Justice Bean, the lead judge on the appeal panel, said the US judgment \"is not, and could not be, relevant\" to the issues in English law.\nLawyers for Mr Hayes and Mr Palombo had raised concerns that judges had decided whether their conduct was permitted, but this should have been for the jury to decide. This was also dismissed.\nThe traders say they will now apply to take their cases to the Supreme Court.\nMr Palombo, who worked for Barclays, was convicted of seeking to influence where the Euribor interest rate was set to suit his trading positions.\nThe scandal around the setting of Libor and Euribor broke in 2012 just after the financial crisis, as a light was shone on the workings of the City of London.\nThe subsequent prosecutions in London and New York focused the blame on individual traders.\nJuries were shown messages in which the traders had jokily discussed how easy it was to influence where the rate was set, for example, a message from Mr Hayes suggesting you just needed to offer the colleague responsible a Mars Bar.\nBanks have paid $9bn in fines for manipulating Libor and Euribor but no senior executive has ever been prosecuted.\nThe UK is currently the only jurisdiction in the world that treats what traders did as criminal.\nThe BBC revealed evidence last year that indicated that central banks including the Bank of England and the central banks of France, Italy, Spain and the US intervened on a large scale in the setting of Libor and Euribor.",

    "A minister has refused to confirm whether the government will pay compensation to women hit by the rise in the state pension age.\nThe Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) campaign group says they were not properly informed about the change.\nAn ombudsman last week recommended that the women receive an apology and pay-outs of between \u00c2\u00a31,000 and \u00c2\u00a32,950.\nMel Stride told the Commons its report would be \"properly\" considered.\nLabour also failed to say what it would do regarding compensation, but called on the Work and Pensions Secretary to return to the Commons quickly.\nThe SNP asked whether another TV drama was needed to \"embarrass and shame them into doing the right thing\", in reference to the television series which elevated the plight of sub-postmasters and postmistresses who have been fighting for compensation in their battle against the Post Office.\nMeanwhile, the chair of the WASPI campaign group, Angela Madden told the BBC the minister made references to the report being 100 pages long \"as if he were being asked to digest War and Peace\".\n\"The fact it is has taken five years for the ombudsman to produce his conclusions is a pretty perverse reason to say more delay is now justified,\" she said. \"The report is not complicated at all...\n\"The Commons must get a debate and vote on compensation as soon as possible after Easter.\"\nWhile Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has hinted at the possibility of a pay-out, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was not drawn on the possibility when asked over the weekend.\nInstead, he committed to the future of the triple-lock state pension pledge if the Conservatives continued in government after the election.\nKey review\nA long-awaited report by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) was published on Thursday. It spent five years looking at whether some women were properly informed of the rise in the state pension age to bring them into line with men, not the equalisation policy.\nOn the sample of cases it considered, it said there was injustice and an apology and compensation should be forthcoming. The ombudsman can recommend compensation, but cannot enforce it.\nIt added that up to now the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had \"clearly indicated it will refuse to comply\" on its pay-out proposal, which it said was \"unacceptable\".\nMr Stride said only some women were affected and that involved communication between 2005 and 2007.\nBut he told MPs the ombudsman did not find that women had \"directly lost out financially as a result of DWP's actions\".\nHe quoted from the report that the ombudsman did \"not find that it [meaning DWP's communication] resulted in them [referring to the complainants] suffering direct financial loss\".\nHowever, he acknowledged there were \"strong feelings\" involved and said there would be \"no undue delay\" in coming back to Parliament with an update.\n'Devastating impact'\nAudrey Evans, 66, from Nottingham, says she feels \"really aggrieved that the government have changed the age as they went along\".\n\"They haven't considered the impact on women,\" she says, adding that people who were born in the 1950s tended to work from a much younger age.\nShe was just 14 when she started working full-time in a sewing machine factory.\nEventually she qualified as a nurse and spent the rest of her career in the caring profession.\nHaving to postpone retirement had a \"devastating impact\" on her life as her husband is nine years older, so he was 74 before they could retire together.\n\"That's a massive gap in the quality of retired life together,\" she says. \"The government basically robbed us of precious years together, a total injustice.\"\nThe possibility of compensation \"would be some recognition that we were hardly done by,\" she says, but it \"would have been better had we had a pension from 60\".\nThe age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women. But for decades, men received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60.\nUnder the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020.\nBut the coalition government of 2010 decided to speed that up. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was brought forward to 2018.\nThe increases have been controversial. Campaigners claim women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by the rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected.\nMany thousands said they had no idea they would have to wait longer to receive their state pension, and had suffered financial and emotional distress as a result.",

    "A father has been found not guilty of the manslaughter of his daughter.\nStephen Niland was accused of shaking his daughter Molly as an infant and causing her brain damage which led to her death 14 years later.\nThroughout his trial at Sheffield Crown Court, Mr Niland protested his innocence and said he did not do anything to harm her.\nOn Wednesday, a jury found Mr Niland, 41, of Holyrood Road, Doncaster, not guilty of manslaughter.\nDuring the three-week trial, jurors heard how Mr Niland had been alone with his daughter on 19 October 2005 and experienced difficulty feeding her.\nHe said Molly would not latch onto the bottle and was crying for about 15 minutes before he briefly left her on a mat to go to the bathroom.\nHe said when he returned he could tell something was wrong as Molly's crying had changed and her back was arched, her toes pointed and her eyes purple.\nCatastrophic injuries\nIn his evidence, Mr Niland said he and his partner had been worried about Molly and visited GPs and hospitals as she had been \"off it\" all week but no serious concerns were identified at the time.\nMr Niland was later accused of having shaken the infant, causing catastrophic injuries, including brain bleeding, spinal bleeding and retinal bleeding, which would lead to her death 14 years later.\nThese injuries formed the basis for doctors to suspect a non-accidental head injury, jurors heard.\nMr Niland vehemently denied the accusation but was subsequently charged with causing grievous bodily harm, an offence he admitted in 2006.\nMr Niland told jurors he had been innocent and only pleaded guilty after his barrister told him medical evidence was stacked up against him and he feared prolonged imprisonment.\nHe said his main aim was to get back to his family, adding: \"I was told 'you have not got a chance, you've got all the big doctors against you', I was told I'd go to prison.\"\nDuring the trial, it was heard no external injuries were found on Molly and that this area of forensic pathology was still widely debated.\nSome experts believe shaken baby syndrome, the type of brain injury doctors suspected Molly had suffered, was \"overdiagnosed\".\nDefence expert witness Dr Joseph Scheller told the court Molly's brain injuries could have been due to complications at birth.\nHe said the CT scans from 2005 showed him the fluid that had built up in Molly's skull due to trauma had been \"chronic\" and \"there for a while\" and could have subsequently caused a brain bleed.\nDefending Mr Niland, Anya Lewis KC, said he was a gentle and loving father who was \"the proudest man alive\" when Molly was born.\nOn Wednesday, after five-and-a-half hours of deliberations, a jury of six men and six women found Mr Niland not guilty of manslaughter.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "A new report by the UN describes the \"outrageous practices\" used by gangs in Haiti to brutalise, punish and control the civilian population.\nIt says that the gangs, which are estimated to control more than 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, recruit and abuse children, sometimes killing those who try to escape.\nUN Human Rights chief Volker T\u00c3\u00bcrk chief said the situation was \"cataclysmic\".\nHe warned that weapons continue to pour into the country.\nWarning: Some readers may find the details in this article distressing.\nThe report published on Thursday found that there had been a significant increase in armed violence caused by criminal gangs in the five months leading up to March.\nGangs used sexual violence in particular to spread fear in areas where they fought for control, it says: \"During gang attacks, several women and girls have been subjected to rape, including collective rape, in their homes, often after having witnessed the killing of their husbands.\"\nIt adds that some of the rape victims had been mutilated or killed after the attacks.\nAccording to the report, Haiti's armed criminal gangs also inflicted violence on children.\nThe victim in one particular incident was a three-month-old baby while in a surge of violence in an area of the capital previously considered relatively safe, entire families were burned alive in their homes.\nThe report focussed in particular on the months from September 2023 to the end of February. It found that armed violence caused by criminal gangs had \"significantly increased in intensity\" and the gangs had expanded their geographic reach.\nSpeaking to the BBC on Wednesday, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation for Haiti, Marisela Silva, said that almost 90% of Port-au-Prince, the capital, was now controlled by or under the influence of armed groups.\nMs Silva described how there had been a shift in the violence in recent weeks as rival armed groups appeared to have united and were now attacking the police rather than each other.\nShe warned that the population was caught in the crossfire.\nWith so much of the capital under the control of armed groups, access to emergency services has become almost non-existent.\n\"There are only two ambulances that are able to circulate in the proximity of the areas affected by the armed violence,\" she said.\nAid operations in the capital have also been hampered by ambushes along key access routes.\nMs Silva said the ICRC had managed to access its medical supplies after \"a very complex operation that included dialogue with various armed groups\".\n\"We need to be able to bring what is needed to those in the field,\" she stressed, recognising that even though the ICRC's neutral and impartial approach had succeeded in building trust it was not always possible to gain access to areas controlled by the armed groups.\n\"We don't have armed protection, our only way of preventing security incidents is through a dialogue with all actors,\" Ms Silva said.\nThe Haiti delegation head said that she was worried the humanitarian situation in Haiti could deteriorate even further as more and more people are displaced and struggle to access safe drinking water, food and even the most basic health services.\n\"Haiti is prone to epidemics, such as cholera. If there is no safe water, if there is no minimum hygiene, then there is a risk of that,\" she warned.",
    "The excavation of HS2's longest tunnel has been completed.\nA tunnelling machine reached the end of its 10-mile (16km) journey on Thursday at a site near South Heath, Buckinghamshire.\nCecilia, named after Buckinghamshire-born astronomer and astrophysicist Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, was launched in June 2021.\nThe tunnel will form part of HS2, the high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham.\nA second machine , named after Florence Nightingale, cut through the chalk beneath the Chiltern Hills last month.\nBoth began their journeys near Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, close to the M25 motorway.\nThey dug a twin-bore tunnel with a depth of up to 80m (about 260ft) that will be used for HS2 trains.\nHS2 Ltd said each machine operated as an \"underground factory\" with crews of nearly 20 people working in shifts to keep them running constantly.\nThe tunnel was excavated and lined with 112,000 precast concrete wall segments which were grouted into position. The process moved forward at an average speed of about 16m (about 50ft) a day.\nHS2 Ltd's head of civil works for this section of the route, Mark Clapp, said Thursday was a \"remarkable achievement for all concerned\".\nHe added: \"But it's only the end of the first chapter in the story of building Britain's high-speed railway under the Chiltern Hills.\n\"Several years of intensive, world-class engineering lie ahead of us to complete the tunnels' four ventilation shafts plus headhouses, [and] install the mechanical and electrical plant and machinery, slab track and overhead electrical wires before trains begin passing through at 200mph.\"\nHeadhouses are buildings on top of ventilation shafts that contain air flow and ventilation systems.\nDidier Jacques, underground construction director at main contractor Align, said: \"The complexity and technical challenges of completing such a long drive for both our tunnel-boring machines (TBMs) has been significant. However, I am delighted that as a team we have risen to the challenge.\"\nHe said both machines \"incorporate innovations and technologies that have been introduced on TBMs in the UK for the first time\".\nThese include \"semicontinuous boring\", allowing the machines to build the rings that line the tunnels without pausing.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Climate change threatens to \"call time\" on the great British pint.\nBut scientists are working with the brewing industry to help save it.\nHops give bitter its taste but the plant doesn't like the hotter, drier conditions we've experienced in recent decades and production has plummeted.\nResearchers in Kent are isolating hop genes in the hope of producing more climate-change resilient varieties.\nThey also want to produce more intense flavours that are now becoming popular.\n\"Without it, the British pint is going to die off,\" Danielle Whelan of the Shepherd Neame brewery said of the work.\n\"We are just going to be importing beer and we won't have the culture that goes with it anymore.\"\nWarmer, drier conditions have also affected the trademark bitter flavour hops gives beer. And the worry is that because of climate change, the problem is only going to get worse. Eddie Gadd, the head brewer at Ramsgate Brewery said that it was already having an impact.\n\"Climate change is very relevant to me,\" he said.\n\"I buy most of my hops from Kent and I've seen the harvests over the past 10 or 12 years going up and down. It has been a real rollercoaster.\n\"The growers have been feeling the impact and the search for drought-resistant genes is going to be exceptionally important.\"\nIt is an issue across Europe. An analysis published last year found that in some key hop-growing areas, there was a drop of nearly 20% in output.\nThe new research is co-led by Dr Helen Cockerton of the University of Kent. She will be analysing the genetic code of hundreds of different varieties. Dr Cockerton will be searching for genes in plants that are drought-resistant which could be crossbred with plants that are currently grown for use in beer production.\nShe will also be searching for genes that give beer added flavours, some of which may not be popular now, but could become fashionable in a few years' time. The current trend is for a strong, \"punchy\" taste.\n\"Brewers want good-tasting beer, so they need their hops to produce the flavour their customers want,\" she said. \"But the growers are more interested in having plants that are able to produce good yields in the field in the presence of diseases and droughts.\n\"Our aim is to give plant breeders the information they need to do both.\"\nDr Cockerton is working with Dr Klara Hajdu, a hop breeder with Wye Hops. Dr Hajdu will breed the new varieties with the new drought, disease and flavour genes to see if they grow well in the field.\n\"I am very optimistic,\" she told BBC News.\n\"We can speed up this breeding  process if we know what traits to look for in the DNA and it will be much easier to produce these plants.\"\nThen the most important test of all: Dr Hajdu will then ask Eddie Gadd to produce beer from the experimental varieties.\nThe master brewer told BBC News: \"The great news from my perspective is that 10 years ago, I was sceptical that we could produce intense flavours in hops in our climate.\"\nHe added: \"What I have seen is that absolutely we can.\"\nThe project is part of a larger research initiative funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to future-proof UK food production against challenges such as climate change.

    "The House of Representatives has approved a spending package that will fund the US government through September.\nIt is the first step in a race by legislators in the US Congress to beat a midnight deadline that would trigger a partial shutdown of the US government.\nThe final vote was 286 to 134, narrowly above the two-thirds majority needed. All but 23 Democrats backed the legislation, while 112 Republicans voted no.\nThe package now moves to the Democrat-controlled Senate, where it is expected to have sufficient support to pass Friday evening.\nThe $1.2tn (\u00c2\u00a3951bn) legislation was the result of bipartisan negotiations and funds a broad swath of federal services through October, including a 3% increase in US defence funding.\nThe vote was yet another example of the difficulties the narrow Republican majority in the House of Representatives has had in approving new spending legislation since taking control of the chamber last year.\nA small but vocal group of conservatives has opposed proposed increases in government spending and called for new legislation that would include US immigration law changes aimed at addressing a surge of undocumented migrants at the US southern border.\n\"No Republican in the House of Representatives in good conscience can vote for this bill,\" said Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia during Friday debate on the House package.\n\"It is a complete departure of all our principles.\"\nMs Greene has since then filed a motion to force an election for a new House Speaker and replace Mike Johnson of Louisiana.\nHard-line Republicans used the same tactic last year to oust the then-speaker, Kevin McCarthy, over another budget disagreement. The move caused Congress to spiral into disarray for weeks, as Republicans sought a new leader to lead the House.\nThe Georgia congresswoman has taken the first procedural step to follow through on her threat to oust the replacement that Republicans eventually landed on - Mr Johnson.\nMs Greene called the motion a \"warning and a pink slip\" while speaking to reporters on Friday, as she has allowed a vote on it to be delayed until next month. She added that she respects the chamber and does not wish to \"throw the House into chaos\".\nBut her latest gambit could setup another bitter Republican leadership battle in the chamber just months before November's US elections.\nMeanwhile, the House budget vote on Friday continues the trend in recent government-funding fights of Democrats joining some Republicans to approve legislation to avert a shutdown.\nUnlike recent votes, however, a majority of House Republicans opposed a funding bill negotiated by their own party.\nIf the Senate fails to approve the legislation, operational funding would cease for some parts of the US government, although the full impact would not be felt until the new work week begins on Monday.",

    "Illegal activity involving the use of Nottingham council houses as children's homes has been uncovered by an auditor.\nAccording to Grant Thornton, 12 houses owned by the authority under its Housing Revenue Account (HRA) were used as children's homes, contrary to legislation.\nAn interim audit report said the properties were used in this way between between 2009-10 and 2022-23.\nThe council says the issue has been \"largely corrected\".\nIn February government appointed commissioners were brought in to oversee the council after it declared itself effectively bankrupt.\nThe interim report, discussed at an audit committee meeting on Friday, said: \"We also now highlight illegal use of premises between the General Fund and the Housing Revenue Account.\n\"Around 12 Housing Revenue Account premises owned by the council were used as children's homes between 2009/10 and 2022/23 [therefore for all three years now under review], contrary to the requirements of the Housing Acts 1985 and 1989.\n\"Officers inform us this was largely corrected during 2022/23, with most of the homes being transferred to the General Fund.\"\nA council spokesman told the Local Democracy Reporting Service : \"These properties were originally council houses, some of which had been earmarked for disposal.\n\"Children's services at the council had a need to create some small children's homes to accommodate children in care which led to a decision that some of these houses could be utilised for this purpose.\n\"They remained in the Housing Revenue Account and rent was paid to the HRA from Children's Services.\n\"Children's services had an inter-departmental agreement to use these properties rather than a tenancy.\n\"When a review of HRA assets took place, the issue was raised that because the children living in these homes didn't count as tenants, they didn't strictly meet the rules required for these properties to sit in the HRA.\n\"For this reason these properties were then appropriated to the General Fund in order to regularise the arrangement and make sure the rules were properly adhered with.\"\nWrong spending\nA recently-approved HRA business plan confirmed the money would be repaid over eight years.\nWhen asked, the council did not say if correcting the issue involving council houses being used as children's homes comes at any additional cost.\nCorporate director of finance and section 151 officer, Ross Brown, added: \"Just to be really clear, the misappropriation of funds in relation to the HRA is a matter that has now been fully addressed just to offer audit committee that assurance.\n\"We are aware of what the wrongdoings were historically, we have both put the control measures and practices in place to ensure they don't happen again, and we have also introduced a plan for the reimbursement of the funds between the respective areas as appropriate and as signed off by the improvement and assurance board.\"\nIn 2021 it was discovered millions from the HRA had been unlawfully spent on day-to-day council services, with the cost of rectifying the issue estimated at about \u00c2\u00a351m with inflation.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "Inverclyde Council has agreed to effectively freeze its council tax despite initially defying the Scottish government.\nThe local authority has received an additional \u00c2\u00a32.9m worth of funding from Holyrood to offset a planned 8.2% rise in the charge.\nHumza Yousaf had announced a national council tax freeze at the SNP conference in October.\nBut the timing of the decision means bills will still rise in April.\nHowever, new bills will then be sent out which take account of this.\nThe council's policy and resources committee approved the \"credit\" for about 29,000 council tax accounts at a meeting on Tuesday.\nNew bills will be calculated and distributed to households by letter or online during May, depending on how they have opted to receive their council tax bills.\nInverclyde, along with Argyll and Bute, had previously agreed to defy proposals outlined by the first minister last month.\nThey had also agreed to a 6% hike in the year 2025/26.\nIt would have meant properties in Band A paying an extra \u00c2\u00a31.50 a week and those in Band D going up by \u00c2\u00a3117 to \u00c2\u00a31547 a year - a rise of \u00c2\u00a32.25 a week.\nCouncil relationship 'badly damaged'\nThe council, which is Labour-run without a majority, said it had opted to increase the charge in order to \"minimise cuts to jobs and services\".\nIts policy and resources convener, Councillor Stephen McCabe, said the government had \"badly damaged its relationship\" with local authority governing body Cosla and urged them to take lessons from the negotiations.\nHe added that the council had taken the \"right decision at the time\" but urged the first minister not to implement any further freezes for the remainder of the current parliament's life.\nCouncillor McCabe said: \"We lobbied the government for that money because it was earmarked specifically for Inverclyde and belongs to the people of Inverclyde who pay their taxes.\n\"I really do hope that the Scottish government learns a lesson from this year's budget process. They may have secured a national council tax freeze but that has come at a significant price.\n\"They have badly damaged their relationship with Cosla and local government more generally. They have forced councils and integrated joint boards to implement significant budget cuts and they have pushed councils one step closer to effective bankruptcy.\"\nFinancial pressure\nAbout 2,300 of Inverclyde's 40,000 households are already exempt from paying council tax and a further 9,000 do not pay any more if there are increases as they are already in receipt of council tax reduction.\nCouncillors in Argyll and Bute are also expected to reverse a decision to increase the charge when they meet in a fortnight.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Scottish ministers are aware that many councils are under financial pressure, which is why the 2024-25 Scottish budget provides record funding for local government of over \u00c2\u00a314bn.\n\"The Scottish government has provided a real terms increase in revenue funding for local government in both 2022-23 and 2023-24, as confirmed by the Accounts Commission.\n\"Decisions on local government budget allocations for future years are subject to the outcome of negotiations with Cosla, the results of which will be confirmed in future Scottish budgets. Any assumptions relating to possible future budget reductions are entirely speculative at this stage.\"\nAchieving a national council tax freeze has been easier said than done this year. It has been a fraught process.\nThe manner in which the freeze was announced by First Minister Humza Yousaf at the SNP conference took councils aback.\nThey had not expected it and some considered the unexpected announcement to be a breach of the Verity House Agreement - an agreement which was meant to improve the relationship between the Scottish government and councils.\nThen came rows over whether the Scottish government was offering councils enough to compensate them for freezing the tax.\nAt its root is a big question. Is local government subservient to the Scottish government or does it have a sufficient degree of autonomy to decide on how to provide and fund local services?\nCouncils are heavily dependent on Scottish government cash and some of it is earmarked for specific services such as education.\nSome would argue councils need more financial powers so they can better meet the needs of the communities they serve.\nThey already have some new ones - for instance the right to charge double council tax on second homes. Progress is being made towards introducing a \"hotel bedroom charge\" or visitor levy in the next few years.\nBut this year has demonstrated the power of central government can hold over local government.\nUltimately, it is hard for a council to say no to government cash.",
    "Ethiopia's largest bank says it has recovered almost three-quarters of the $14m (\u00c2\u00a312m) it lost in a glitch that allowed customers to withdraw more money than they had in their accounts.\nAbe Sano, head of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) said on Tuesday about $10m has been recovered.\nThousands of customers returned the cash voluntarily. Mr Sano warned those who had not will face criminal charges.\nMost of the money was withdrawn by university students.\nOn 16 March, news of the glitch spread across universities - largely via messaging apps and phone calls - and long lines were seen at campus cash machines.\nThe bank has never explained exactly what the problem was, but the CBE said the glitch was not the result of a cyber-attack and that customers should not be worried as their personal accounts were intact.\nAt least three universities released statements advising students to return any money not belonging to them that they may have taken from the bank.\nIn an interview with the BBC's Newsday programme last week Mr Abe said the CBE was already in the process of reporting customers to the police.\n\"There is no way that they can escape because they are digital [transactions] and they are our customers.

    "So far, 20% of Conservative MPs - a total of 63 - have announced they are jacking it in at the general election.\nAnd 20% of Scottish National Party MPs have said the same.\nThe figure is 8% for Labour MPs.\nThe reasons for leaving the House of Commons are usually a mix of circumstance and psephology.\nThe personal and the political.\nAn individual's decision reveals a little.\nA collection of decisions reveals a trend.\nAnd the trend is clear.\nParties whose MPs might conclude their fortunes are heading south have a greater propensity to volunteer their departure from Westminster rather than wait, potentially, for the electorate to do it for them.\nIn other words, they are illustrations, as a trend, of the impact of the political prevailing wind, or at least where it is perceived to be blowing, given current opinion polls.\nTake the departures of Robert Halfon and James Heappey as ministers.\nBoth will have their personal reasons informing their decision. Mr Heappey has acknowledged that \"a great deal has changed in my life over the last few years\".\nBut: both are highly regarded within their parties and beyond.\nBoth are passionate about their briefs.\nBoth fell over themselves, to a greater or lesser extent, to be full of praise for Rishi Sunak.\nThese are not figures, by temperament, instinct or actions, that are mounting a political insurrection.\nBut if folk like Mr Halfon and Mr Heappey are walking away, it tells a story.\nRobert Halfon has built up a sizeable majority in Harlow in Essex.\nBut it is a classic bellwether seat, the kind of place that tends to elect an MP from the party that wins the election.\nThe Labour leader Keir Starmer wasn't wandering around a primary school there recently by accident , telling kids he used to play the flute.\nThe places he pops up in are rigorously chosen and highlight in plain sight where Labour has its eyes on.\nJames Heappey won the seat of Wells in Somerset from the Liberal Democrats in 2015.\nThe new seat, Wells and Mendip Hills, will be keenly fought.\nFor some departing ministers, there is another factor in their minds, which comes in the form of an acronym: Acoba.\nIt stands for the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments .\nThe committee sets out the rules about the jobs former minsters can and cannot take on, and when - to try to make sure they are not milking their knowledge and contacts within government.\nThere are no end of rules, but as a rule of thumb the more political water that passes under the bridge, the more time that passes, the more tolerant Acoba are likely to be.\nSo, if you're a serving minister wanting or expecting to end up doing something else after the election, it is rational to consider packing it in now so the clock starts ticking now and not leaving it to start ticking at some point down the track.\nBeing an MP, while a privilege, isn't easy, splitting your life between two places, the welter of public scrutiny and being subject to the vagaries of your party's political fortunes.\nAnd there is always turnover, natural wastage as a human resources director might put it, at every election.\nSo we shouldn't be surprised, right now, that some are thinking of leaving - and that you're more likely to be having just those thoughts if you think your party might be going backwards.\nAnd this will be far from the end of it.\nPlenty more will leave, I suspect - with many backbenchers, in particular, probably leaving it until the very last minute to announce they have had enough.",

    "The tech behind a flying car, originally developed and successfully test-flown in Europe, has been bought by a Chinese firm.\nPowered by a BMW engine and normal fuel, the AirCar flew for 35 minutes between two Slovakian airports in 2021, using runways for take-off and landing.\nIt took just over two minutes to transform from a car into an aircraft.\nNow vehicles made based on its design will be used within a \"specific geographical region\" of China.\nHebei Jianxin Flying Car Technology Company, headquartered in Cangzhou, has purchased exclusive rights to manufacture and use AirCar aircraft inside an undisclosed area.\nThe firm has built its own airport and flight school after a previous acquisition from another Slovak aircraft manufacturer, said Anton Zajac, cofounder of KleinVision, the company which created AirCar.\nHaving led the way in the development of the EV revolution , China is now actively developing flying transport solutions.\nLast month a firm called Autoflight carried out a test flight of a passenger-carrying drone between the cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai. The journey, which takes three hours by car, was completed in 20 minutes, it said - although the aircraft contained no passengers.\nAnd in 2023 the Chinese firm eHang was awarded a safety certificate by Chinese officials for its electric flying taxi. Here, the UK government has said flying taxis could become a regular feature of the skies by 2028.\nBut unlike these drone-like passenger aircrafts, AirCar does not take off and land vertically, and requires a runway.\nKleinVision declined to say how much it had sold the technology for. AirCar was issued with a certificate of airworthiness by the Slovak Transport Authority in 2022 and featured in a video published by YouTuber Mr Beast earlier this year.\nThere are still considerable hurdles for this form of transport in terms of infrastructure, regulation and public acceptance of the technology.\n\"This brave new world of personal transport is acting as a great leveller,\" said aviation consultant Steve Wright.\nGlobal attempts to regulate the sector left \"everyone scrambling to come up with a whole new set of questions that need to be asked\".\n\"In this respect the West's history can sometimes slow things down, as there is a bit of a temptation to try and squeeze these new machines into the old categories,\" Mr Wright added. \"China could well see this as an opportunity to get ahead.\"\nSimilar concerns once applied to electric cars - in which China which has become a global market leader .\nThe sale of the Slovakian AirCar could raise questions about whether China might be poised to do the same with flying cars.\nMr Wright said while prototypes like the AirCar were \"great fun\", the reality was likely to end up being more mundane \"with queues and baggage checks and whatnot\".",

    "British fashion designers such as Vivienne Westwood, Stella McCartney and Zandra Rhodes are being celebrated in a new exhibition at Blenheim Palace.\nThe journey begins in the 300-year-old Great Hall that features designs from the late Dame Vivienne and creative partner Andreas Kronthaler.\nFrom there, each of the palace's significant rooms has been transformed by a different designer.\nEach designer looked around the palace and picked a room.\nAnd that is what makes the exhibition so unique.\nThere are no stuffy spaces crammed with random items or looking embarrassingly sparse. This sprawling exhibition that takes over the whole palace is wonderfully immersive.\nThe concept behind the exhibition came from keeper of the palace, Kate Ballenger.\n\"We wanted to create a group show that celebrated the best of British fashion,\" she explained. \"So I invited the designers to the palace where they could pick a room, respond to the space and then we let them bring their vision to life.\"\nLuckily for Ms Ballenger, all of the designers picked different rooms.\n\"We had an egalitarian approach of 'first come, first served' and fortunately it worked out perfectly and it made my life a lot easier given no one wanted the same space.\"\nMs Ballenger, who has been planning the exhibition for the past year, was conscious of creating something that could reach a new audience.\n\"Most of our exhibitions are historical and so we wanted to create something that would appeal to people who don't usually visit historic properties,\" she said.\nRooms not to be missed\nAs well as a look back at some of the best in British fashion history, part of the exhibition is about the future and upcoming innovation in the industry.\nIn the library, Stella McCartney's Uppeal, a vegan apple-based alternative to animal leather is part of her display.

The short answer is no.\nUnder the proposed Animal Protection Act, certain traits would be defined in dogs that can cause \"pain, suffering or damage\".\nThe VDH fears this could lead to a ban on breeding sausage dogs, because their short legs and elongated spine can lead to knee, hip and back problems. Other breeds, such as bulldogs or pugs, which can have breathing problems, could also be targeted, says the association.\n\"No dog breeds will be banned,\" a spokesman for the Green-led agriculture ministry told me bluntly. \"We want to prevent breeders from deforming dogs so much, that they suffer.\"\nThe government's argument is that dog breeds are continually developing and at risk of having increasingly extreme characteristics.\nSo breeding dogs with specific traits, such as skeletal abnormalities, that lead to suffering, poor health or a short life expectancy, would no longer be allowed. \"Just because people find something new or aesthetically pleasing, animals shouldn't be tormented,\" said the ministry's spokesman.\nSo-called \"torture breeding\" has been illegal in Germany for three decades. But until now the law has been vague and open to interpretation.\nThis new draft would give precise scientific criteria about what sort of breeding can lead to an animal suffering. Existing animals would be able to be kept but would not be allowed to breed or exhibit in shows.\n\"Torture breeding\" is not in the interests of the dog, the owner or the breeder, argues the government, given that everyone wants these animals to live normal, healthy lives.\n\"There will always be sausage dogs,\" the spokesman said. \"We will just never see any with legs one centimetre long.\"\nDachshunds, which can be translated as \"badger dogs\", were bred in Germany for hunting. Their short legs and long body helped them burrow into holes.\nMichael Lazaris of Vets on the Common, in London, says many as one in five Dachshunds suffer from intervertebral disc disease because of their elongated spines. Dachshunds can also suffer from chronic hip and knee problems due to their short legs.\nDr Lazaris advises buying puppies from responsible breeders and says that many genetic diseases can be bred out \"by not using dogs with those specific health problems\". This is essentially the aim of the new German draft law.\nMeanwhile the German branch of animal rights organisation Peta is indeed calling for a ban on 17 breeds, including sausage dogs, pugs and French bull dogs. English bull dogs are also on Peta's list. An online petition calling for the draft law to include these breeds has almost 70,000 signatures so far.\nLater this year the draft version of the Animal Protection Law will be put to the German cabinet and then to the Bundestag, Germany's parliament.\nWith key regional elections across eastern Germany in September, there are bound to be more stories about bossy Greens supposedly banning well-loved German traditions. This story has legs.",

    "More than \u00c2\u00a39m is to be invested in dental services in Northern Ireland.\nThe funding is aimed at bolstering support for dental practices and protecting public access to health service dental care.\nThe health minister also confirmed a 6% pay uplift for dentists for the current financial year.\nThe British Dental Association said the money \"falls well short of what's needed\" and urged further reform.\nIn 2022 a BBC investigation found most NHS dental practices in Northern Ireland were not accepting new patients .\nThe \u00c2\u00a39.2m investment package for dental services includes:\nThe pay increase will be backdated to April 2023 and is in line with the recommendations from the DDRB (Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body).\nThe uplift comes with a 7.3% uplift to non-staff expenses for 2023/24, with a 3% recurrent award in future years.\nMinister Robin Swann said he hopes the money \"eases some of the pressures on practices and emphasises the importance of the service being provided\".\nMr Swann said these interventions are designed \"to remove some of the barriers that are limiting that access\".\n\"It is essential that we have a service that works for both the profession and patients,\" he said.\nPractices working to an archaic high volume/low margin contractual model already faced delivering some NHS treatments at a loss, and the looming ban on dental amalgam was set to destroy the fragile business model they work to.\nCiara Gallagher, Chair of the British Dental Association's Northern Ireland Dental Practice Committee, said: \"We get that this is the best the Minister could do at this difficult time, but it falls well short of what needs to be done.\"\n\"Time will tell if it's enough to bring dentistry in Northern Ireland back from the brink.\"\n\"Patients are struggling to secure access, and real progress will hinge on real reform and fair funding.\"\nEU amalgam laws\nThe health minister also provided an update on the proposed changes to the EU laws relating to dental amalgam and his concerns regarding the implications for Northern Ireland.\n\"These changes would significantly restrict dentists from placing amalgam fillings, increase costs for patients and have a significant impact on the capacity of a service that is still struggling since the pandemic,\" he said.\nMr Swann said his view remains that a phase down approach in line with the wider UK position, rather than a phase out, of amalgam is in the best interests of patients in Northern Ireland but that is a matter for the new Windsor Framework Democratic Scrutiny Committee to consider in detail, in terms of impacts in Northern Ireland.\nHe said members of the Stormont Assembly will \"wish to consider whether the initiation of the Stormont Brake process is necessary and justified.\"\nThe Department of Health has written to the committee to advise of concerns around the significant and persisting impact of the new laws.",

    "Millions of Americans' online accounts have been caught up in a \"sinister\" Chinese hacking plot that targeted US officials, the justice department and FBI said on Monday.\nSeven Chinese nationals have been charged with enacting a widespread cyber-attack campaign.\nThey are accused of ties to a hacking operation that ran for 14 years.\nThe US state department announced a reward of up to $10m (\u00c2\u00a38m) for information on the seven men.\nThe justice department said hackers had targeted US and foreign critics of China, businesses, and politicians.\nThe seven men allegedly sent over 10,000 \"malicious emails, impacting thousands of victims, across multiple continents\", in what the justice department called a \"prolific global hacking operation\" backed by China's government.\n\"Today's announcement exposes China's continuous and brash efforts to undermine our nation's cybersecurity and target Americans and our innovation,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said.\n\"As long as China continues to target the US and our partners, the FBI will continue to send a clear message that cyber espionage will not be tolerated, and we will tirelessly pursue those who threaten our nation's security and prosperity,\" he added.\nThe charges come after the UK's government also accused China of being responsible for \"malicious cyber campaigns\" targeting the country's Electoral Commission and politicians. Diplomats at the Chinese embassy in London said it \"strongly opposes\" the accusations, calling them \"completely fabricated and malicious slanders\".\nNew Zealand's government also said its parliament had been targeted by China-backed hackers, the New Zealand Herald reported.\nA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington DC said \"without valid evidence, relevant countries jumped to an unwarranted conclusion\" and \"made groundless accusations\".\nIn an indictment setting out charges against the seven Chinese men, US prosecutors said the hacking resulted in the confirmed or potential compromise of work accounts, personal emails, online storage and telephone call records.\nThe emails they are accused of sending targets often appeared to be from prominent news outlets or journalists, containing hidden tracking links. If a person opened the email sent to them, their information - including their location and IP addresses - would be sent to a server allegedly controlled by the seven defendants.\nThis information was then used to enable more \"direct and sophisticated targeted hacking, such as compromising the recipients' home routers and other electronic devices\", US prosecutors said.\nAs well as targeting US government officials working at the White House and US state departments, and in some cases their spouses, they were also said to have targeted foreign dissidents globally.\nIn one example cited by the justice department, the men \"successfully compromised Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and their associates located in Hong Kong, the United States, and other foreign locations with identical malware\".\nUS companies were hacked too, with the men allegedly targeting defence, information technology, telecommunications, manufacturing and trade, finance, consulting, legal, and research industries.\nCompanies targeted included defence contractors who provide services to the US military and \"a leading provider of 5G network equipment\", the justice department said.",
    "People in Gaza are facing desperate living conditions and food shortages as the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues.\nAlmost two million people - most of the population - are reported to have fled their homes and those who remain in northern Gaza are on the brink of famine, according to the United Nations.\nThe Strip has been under the control of Hamas since 2007 and Israel says it is trying to destroy the military and governing capabilities of the Islamist group, which is committed to the destruction of Israel.\nMuch of the small enclave of Gaza, only 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and fenced off from Israel and Egypt at its borders - has become uninhabitable.\nAnd people are starving. Half the population is struggling with catastrophic hunger and famine is imminent in northern parts of Gaza, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the global body responsible for declaring famine.\nSave the Children says families are struggling to find enough food and water and children are dying because of malnutrition and disease.\nEven before the current conflict, about 80% of the population of Gaza was in need of humanitarian aid. Aid deliveries halted at the start of the latest conflict have resumed, but at much lower levels - with about 164 aid lorries a day crossing into southern Gaza from Egypt.\nThe World Food Programme says that addressing the simple food needs would require at least 300 trucks a day to enter Gaza and distribute food.\nAgencies say distribution is hampered by the lack of infrastructure as the area endures intense bombardment, movement restrictions, interrupted communications and fuel shortages.\nThere have also been reports of crowds looting aid lorries.\nThe WFP's chief operating officer, Carl Skau said: \"The complicated border controls, combined with the high tensions and desperation inside Gaza, make it nearly impossible for food supplies to reach people in need, particularly in the north.\"\nSome countries, including the US, Belgium and Jordan, have delivered aid by air - parachuting crates of aid from planes into coastal areas.\nAid charity World Central Kitchen built its own jetty on the coast and delivered 200 tonnes of food by sea in its first shipment. The cargo includes beans, carrots, canned tuna, chickpeas, canned corn, parboiled rice, flour, oil, salt and pallets of dates.\nThe US military is also planning to build a temporary dock and pier for deliveries by sea.\nIsrael's ground offensive\nThe desperate food situation comes after six months of conflict.\nIsrael responded to the 7 October attacks by Hamas with an intense bombing campaign, followed by a ground invasion.\nArmoured bulldozers created routes for tanks and troops, as the Israeli forces tried to clear the area of Hamas fighters based in northern Gaza.\nHaving cut Gaza in two, the Israelis pushed further into Gaza City, where they faced resistance from Hamas. While Israeli forces have since conducted ground operations across much of northern Gaza, there are still clashes in some areas, according to analysts from the Institute for the Study of War.\nWhole districts in Gaza City have been razed to the ground and swathes of agricultural land and greenhouse areas have been returned to sand under the tracks of heavy vehicles and tanks as part of clearing operations by Israeli troops.\nCivilians living in the area north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed, including the densely populated Gaza City, were warned to evacuate in October.\nThe Erez border crossing into Israel in the north was closed, so those living in the evacuation zone had no choice but to head towards the southern districts.\nMillions seek shelter in southern Gaza\nAfter establishing a strong position in the north, Israeli forces focused their attention on the southern cities.\nThe main urban areas - Khan Younis and Rafah - have been bombed and Israeli troops have clashed with Hamas fighters on the ground.\nThe local population, now including thousands who fled fighting in the north, have been told to move to a so-called \"safe area\" at al-Mawasi, a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast, close to the Egyptian border.\nFighting in Khan Younis and the central Deir al Balah area has also pushed tens of thousands of people to flee to the southern district of Rafah, the UN said, where more than a million people \"are squeezed into an extremely overcrowded space\".\nAccording to the UN, just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - were already registered refugees before October 2023.\nPalestinian refugees are defined by the UN as people whose \"place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 War\". More than 500,000 of the refugee population lived in eight crowded \"camps\" which became densely packed built-up areas, located across the Strip.\nFollowing Israel's warnings after 7 Oc",

    "The mother of a footballer fatally stabbed in a Birmingham nightclub is calling for legislation in his memory to force venues to stock bleed kits and introduce metal detectors.\nCody Fisher was killed at Crane on 26 December 2022 after a large knife was smuggled into the club.\nTracey Fisher said the venue had \"blood on its hands\" with prosecutors questioning the security on the night.\nThe BBC has attempted to contact the firm behind the club.\nRemy Gordon, 23, and Kami Carpenter were convicted of murder on Monday and are expected to be sentenced on 8 April.\nMrs Fisher described the pair as \"evil\", but is campaigning for the introduction of Cody's Law in the hope that it will save others' lives. Thousands have so far signed a petition backing her call.\nThe West Midlands Police force area has the highest rate of knife crime in England , including London.\nWhether or not a bleed kit would have saved Cody at the event at Crane, Mrs Fisher said kits would save countless others.\nHer son was targeted by a group in masks on the dance floor, headbutted, beaten and finally stabbed with a six-inch blade in the heart.\nHis crime was merely to have bumped into one of the men, Remy Gordon, at a packed bar in Solihull two days earlier.\nThe trial painted a picture of cursory security on the night at Crane - an event that attracted more than 2,000 people.\n'Not even a metal detector'\nWhile metal-detecting wands were used on some people, others simply faced a pat-down, while Gordon's bag was not searched at all, the trial heard.\nOnce inside, Gordon messaged Carpenter to say \"not even a metal detector\", although the court heard it was not clear who had managed to take the knife in.\nDuring the trial, jurors were shown Snapchat messages sent between Gordon and Carpenter in the hours before. They contained references to a \"bally\" (balaclava) and one from Carpenter asked, \"Can I get a shank [knife] in there?\"\nMr Fisher's girlfriend Jess Chatwin and best friend Dan Vann, who were with him at the time of his death, both criticised the club's security that night.\nMs Chatwin said she had been to Crane once before and remembered metal detecting wands being used, but said it was much more relaxed on Boxing Day.\n\"They didn't even look into my bag, didn't pat me down or anything,\" she said.\nThey \"took a quick glance\" in Mr Fisher's shoulder bag, but did not use any metal detectors and instead \"lightly patted him down\", Ms Chatwin added.\nShe described seeing people with nitrous oxide canisters inside, saying: \" I just couldn't understand how you could get that into such a big place with so many security.\n\"I can remember saying to him, 'That's dangerous', and he said, 'I know', and then a few hours later he was stabbed to death.\"\nJurors were told 26 security staff belonging to K&S Security Services, a Loughborough-based firm, had been working that night alongside medical staff.\nThe security manager indicated to staff a \"Code Red\" alert when they were made aware of a serious incident and Mr Fisher was seen on the floor. CPR was administered before paramedics arrived, but he died at the scene.\nK&S Security Services has been approached by the BBC, but has not responded.\nThe Crane club subsequently lost its licence amid fears it posed \"terrifying\" risks to public safety. That was just three months after it began operating.\nRepresenting the operator at the licensing hearing, barrister Nicholas Leviseur said that revoking the licence was \"wholly inappropriate\", but police said on the night Mr Fisher died, three people had needed medical help after taking drugs.\nThere was \"blatant and widespread\" use of drugs inside the venue that evening, the licensing hearing was told, and video footage showed a person inhaling from a balloon believed to contain nitrous oxide, regardless of the police and medical presence following the stabbing.\nMrs Fisher said her talented footballer son would be alive today had security been more thorough.\nSpeaking ahead of the sentencing, she said: \"It doesn't matter whatever they [Cody's killers] get in prison, that will never be justice for me because Cody's not going to walk back through the door, he's not going to sit at the dinner table with me again.\n\"He's not going to play football again... to get married and have children and do so many things that he had to do. He's never going to get to do that because of those individuals and I just think that it's got to start with the criminal justice system.\"\nShe said she wanted to see tougher sentences for knife possession to act as more of a deterrent, but she hoped Cody's Law would also mean more peace of mind for parents while knife crime was so prevalent.\nMr Vann, who was attacked in the same incident, said he also wanted metal detectors to be mandatory at large events.\n\"They know it's going to be massive... you can see by the amount of tickets that have been sold and just letting people get in with a little tap down, it's not good enough,\" he said.\nJonathan Leon, founder of TL",

He was told if it got any lower he would need a transplant.\nTwo years later, it had dropped to 5%. Steven told his best friend, Kael Ace.\n\"Kael said, 'have mine'. At first I thought he was joking but he was completely serious,\" Steven said.\nKael went for tests and the results came back as a perfect match.\nSteven, from Clydach, Swansea, was told he could be waiting two years for the surgery on the NHS and would need to start dialysis before that.\n\"It was a long process,\" Kael remembered. \"Lots of blood tests, kidney function tests, but I just hoped everything would work out.\n\"It goes then to a donor board, to make sure there's no money or bribery involved.\"\nSteven explained how the friends used pictures to verify their 10-year friendship, which started when they joined the same rugby team.\n\"They then interviewed us separately to make sure nothing untoward was going on,\" he said.\nSteven was best man at Kael's wedding last October.\n\"I couldn't see my best friend that ill or even pass away, and not to do anything about it,\" Kael said.\nKael's family were initially shocked, but \"came around in the end, after I'd explained the process\".\nBy September 2023, Steven's kidney function had dropped to 2% and he was having dialysis three times a week.\nKael said it was difficult seeing his friend deteriorate.\n\"It was mentally draining seeing your best man like that,\" he said.\nBut Kael's donation meant that, after all the checks were completed, the pair could start preparing for surgery at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.\n'His colour was back'\nThe operation on 19 February was a success and the best friends are both doing well.\n\"Straight after the surgery I felt so much better,\" Steve said. \"I hadn't felt like that in about three years.\"\nKael said it was a \"joy\" to see his friend looking better.\n\"I could tell straight away,\" he said, explaining how at first they could only talk to each other via a video call.\n\"I could just tell through the phone that his colour was back in his face, and he just had a warm glow.\"\nSteven has urged people to go to the GP if they sense anything is wrong.\n\"I was just putting it off and putting it off, but looking back if I hadn't gone for a blood test I might not be here today.\n\"It's so important.\"",
    "A Belfast man allegedly tried to kill a woman with a hatchet he described as a Valentine's gift, a court has heard.\nStephen Kennedy, 42, is accused of inflicting deep wounds to the woman's head during an attack at his apartment.\nMr Kennedy, of Montrose Street in Belfast, denies a charge of attempted murder, claiming the woman came into contact with the axe by accident.\nHe was refused bail by a judge who described his version of events as \"risible\".\nPolice and paramedics attended Mr Kennedy's flat in east Belfast following a 999 call on 29 February, the High Court heard on Wednesday.\nMr Kennedy said the woman had suffered head injuries and was drifting in and out of consciousness after falling onto a hatchet in the property.\nThe court heard that when emergency services arrived at the scene, Mr Kennedy was standing outside the apartment block, bare chested and with blood smeared over his face, hands and back.\nOfficers found the woman in a communal area with strike marks on her body and two deep, open wounds to her head.\n\"They gave the impression of having been caused by a bladed weapon,\" a prosecution barrister said.\nBroken dentures\nSignificant amounts of blood were discovered in a lift, stairwell and on the corridor leading from Mr Kennedy's flat, the court heard.\nFurther spatters and a bloodied mop and bucket were detected inside the apartment, where a washing machine was operating.\n\"A small axe and scissors were located, alongside broken dentures and clumps of hair,\" the barrister added.\nMr Kennedy denied any intimate relationship with the woman, insisting she was just a friend staying with him while in Belfast for a hospital appointment.\nHe claimed she had knocked over furniture during an argument, causing the axe to flip into the air and strike her on its descent.\n\"He said the hatchet was a gift from his partner on Valentine's Day,\" the prosecutor said.\nThe woman sustained a number of fractures to her head and required nine stitches for two lacerations.\nAccording to her account, she had been in a relationship with Mr Kennedy for two-and-a-half years.\nMr Kennedy faces a further charge of possessing an offensive weapon with intent to commit attempted murder.\nA defence lawyer described his client as someone who \"keeps himself to himself\".\n\"He is adamant that he does not have a romantic relationship with the injured party, they have just been friends for 15 years,\" he added.\n\"There has never been any issue between them, never mind anything remotely resembling what has been described.\"\nDenying bail to Mr Kennedy, the judge cited the risk of re-offending.\n\"He is entitled to the presumption of innocence, but the explanation put forward by him is risible,\" the judge added.",
    "The US Supreme Court appeared sceptical of an effort to restrict access to a commonly used abortion drug, mifepristone, during a Tuesday hearing.\nSeveral members of the court questioned whether it was an appropriate challenge of the drug's federal approval.\nIt is the most significant abortion case before America's top court since it ended the national right to abortion in June 2022.\nThe outcome could affect abortion access for millions.\nThis case centres on decisions made by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to loosen restrictions of mifepristone's use since 2016.\nThe Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, an umbrella group of anti-abortion doctors and activists, filed a lawsuit in November 2022 alleging that the drug is unsafe and that the federal agency inappropriately expanded access to it.\nNumerous studies have shown that mifepristone, which was first approved by the FDA in 2000, is safe.\nBut the group, which includes medical professionals, has also argued that its members might suffer harm by having to treat patients who used mifepristone to end a pregnancy. They said that would be in opposition to their own religious beliefs.\nElizabeth Prelogar, the US Solicitor General, told the court that the doctors could not show that the FDA's decisions had directly harmed them.\nShe added that ruling in favour of the anti-abortion group would \"severely disrupt the federal system for developing and approving drugs\" and \"inflict grave harm on women across the nation.\"\nSeveral of the judges seemed to find the basis for the case dubious. Even some of the conservative justices who have ruled in favour of anti-abortion plaintiffs in the past questioned whether the doctors had suffered due to the rule changes.\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, pressed the group's attorneys on whether two of the doctors cited in the case had been forced to terminate a pregnancy against their will.\nSome of the justices, both liberal and conservative, asked whether there was a \"mismatch\" between the injuries claimed by the group and the changes they were pursuing - limiting millions of Americans' access to mifepristone.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, another conservative judge appointed by Mr Trump, questioned whether a ruling in their favour could open the door to \"a handful of individuals\" turning a \"small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule, or any other federal government action\".\nTwo of the court's liberal justices, Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, asked why the doctors were not already protected by their right to lodge conscience objections to certain procedures, like abortion.\nMifepristone is used in combination with another drug - misoprostol - for medical abortions, and it is now the most common way to have an abortion in the US.\nMedical abortions accounted for 63% of all abortions in 2023, up from 53% in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute. More than five million US women have used mifepristone to terminate their pregnancies.\nThe court has previously ruled that it would not consider a challenge of the FDA's approval of the drug, but a ruling against the FDA could severely limit access as it would roll back the expansion of access that has occurred since 2016.\nThe FDA announced in 2016 that it would allow mifepristone's use until the 10-week mark, rather than up to seven weeks of gestation. Then in 2021 it lifted in-person dispensing requirements, a move that allowed providers to send it to patients by mail.\nIn 2022, the FDA moved further by allowing retail pharmacies to dispense the drug, meaning medical professionals - not just doctors - could prescribe it. The following year, a judge in Texas revoked the FDA's approval of mifepristone.\nAbortion remains one of the most contentious political issues in the US, and will likely be a major factor in the 2024 election.\nIllustrating that friction, anti-abortion advocates and reproductive rights groups setup lecterns with microphones next to each other at the steps of the Supreme Court. Each side hosted a roster of speakers who called on the justices to \"do the right thing\", though they called for different outcomes.\nIn total, a few hundred protesters gathered outside the court on Tuesday. Many waved signs that carried phrases like 'abortion is healthcare', 'trust medical science' and 'we won't go quietly back to the 1950s'.\nThirteen of the protesters were arrested for illegally blocking roads and a walkway, according to the US Capitol Police.",
    "Is the economy \"turning the corner\"? Conservative MPs hope so. It's the only pathway for turning round the daunting polling lead for Labour in an election year.\nAs we end the first quarter of 2024, what's the evidence? In Scotland, where evidence tends towards scarcity, we have more than usual.\nThursday brings publication of an important survey of members of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, all of them employing under 250 people, and at the same time, the quarterly assessment of the Fraser of Allander Institute.\nHaving cornered much of the market in business surveys, it is that Strathclyde University institute which is behind both publications.\nWage pressures\nAsked between mid-February and 11 March, members of the Chambers of Commerce are facing \"extreme cost pressures\", says their president, Stephen Leckie.\nThis is partly due to the challenge of recruiting people, with nearly half of respondents facing problems, up from the end of last year.\nThe battle for scarce skills means wages are pushed up. Scottish wage inflation is faster than the rest of the UK, much of that explained by more generous public sector pay deals.\nAnd the legal minimum wage is about to rise. From Monday, it's going up from \u00c2\u00a310.42 per hour to \u00c2\u00a311.44, and the minimum age to qualify for that is coming down from 23 to 21.\nFor those aged 23 and above, that's a welcome 10% increase in pay, and 12% for those in their early 20s. Lower minimum pay rates for under-21s and apprentices are up more steeply.\nBut the headline rate remains 56p per hour below the Real Living Wage, at \u00c2\u00a312, independently calculated to provide a basic standard of living to full-time workers.\nFor employees with price-sensitive custom and lots of younger staff on, or near, minimum wage - notably hospitality and retail - this is less welcome.\nPayroll is the main cost pressure bosses are facing. More than three-quarters in the Chambers survey say so, while three in five say energy costs continue to be a major input concern.\nPrice inflation falling\nFor some, their concerns are worsened by the sharply tightened criteria for recruiting abroad. The minimum salary is going up, to a level far above the Scottish average wage.\nTo quote the UK government's fact sheet, it is \"increasing the earning threshold for overseas workers by nearly 50% from its current position of \u00c2\u00a326,200 to \u00c2\u00a338,700 from 4 April 2024, encouraging businesses to look to British talent first and invest in their workforce, helping us to deter employers from over-relying on migration\".\nOver half of firms reported investment is frozen, and that's the way they expect it to remain during the second quarter of 2024, while economic uncertainty remains.\nConsumer price inflation has eased considerably - at 3.4% and soon to decline further as household energy bills fall from next week, it's the figure cited by those Tories looking for green shoots of recovery.\nBut of the Scottish firms surveyed, half say they expect to put prices up, and that's a sharp increase on price expectations at the end of last year.\nThat is one reason economists at the Bank of England is holding off on an interest rate cut, until it can be more confident that wage and price inflation rates are under control.\nHigh-earners wanted\nEarlier this week, a different view from the boardroom was published by the Institute of Directors in Scotland.\nThey were sizing up artificial intelligence, cyber-security and the transition to net zero as costs for some and market opportunities for others.\nThey claim to see opportunities for their businesses in improved work contracts, inclusivity and diversity. But their concerns are focused on the problems of government getting the economic fundamentals right, says Catherine McWilliam.\nShe highlights problems with workforce skills and implementation of government policy and a lack of economic priority or business collaboration coming from Holyrood.\nAmong their main concerns (82% of those responding) is the impact of another income tax bracket being introduced in Scotland next week, raising the tax bill for earnings above \u00c2\u00a375,000 to 45%, even if National Insurance is about to go down by 2p in the pound.\nThose earners can't expect much sympathy, but company directors say these are the people they need to recruit into Scotland, and the divergence in tax regimes is not helping. Nor does it impress potential inward investors, say more than quarter of them.\nBetter off?\nA further bit of data helps fill out the picture, issued by the Scottish government on Wednesday - its first estimate of growth across the Scottish economy during January. After a contraction of 0.6% across the preceding quarter, output rose in the first month of this year by the same amount.\nDecember had also seen such an increase, indicating that the trend may, indeed, be turning a corner back to growth and away from a long period of stagnation.\nSo what do they think at the Fraser of Allander Institute? Its forecast for this year, of 0.6% over the whole of 20",
    "Few had heard of him a year ago, and now he is set to become president.\nBassirou Diomaye Faye's extraordinary rise caps a rollercoaster period in Senegalese politics that caught many off-guard.\nMonths in jail alongside ally and kingmaker Ousmane Sonko ended suddenly, with the pair released the week before the presidential election.\nNow Mr Clean, as he's nicknamed, must get to work on the sweeping reforms he has promised.\n\"Methodical\" and \"modest\" are words often used to describe the tax collector, who celebrates his 44th birthday on Monday.\nMr Faye fondly recalls his rural upbringing in Ndiaganiao, where he says he returns every Sunday to work the land.\nHis love and respect for village life is matched by his deep distrust of Senegal's elites and establishment politics.\n\"He's never been a minister and wasn't a statesman so critics question his lack of experience,\" analyst Alioune Tine tells the BBC.\n\"But, from Faye's point of view, the insiders who've run the country since 1960 have made some catastrophic failures.\"\nFighting poverty, injustice and corruption are top of Mr Faye's agenda. While working at the Treasury, he and Mr Sonko created a union taskforce to tackle graft.\nGas, oil, fishing and defence deals must all be renegotiated to better serve the Senegalese people, says Mr Faye.\nHe is ushering in an era of \"sovereignty\" and \"rupture\" as opposed to more of the same, he told voters, and that is especially true of ties to France.\nSenegal's president-elect says he will drop the much-criticised CFA franc currency, which is pegged to the euro and backed by former colonial power France.\nMr Faye wants to replace it with a new Senegalese, or regional West African, currency, although this will not be easy.\n\"He will have to deal with the reality of the budget to begin with... But I see that he has a lot of ambition,\" former Prime Minister Aminata Tour\u00c3\u00a9, who served under outgoing President Macky Sall, tells the BBC.\nStrengthening judicial independence and creating jobs for Senegal's large young population are also key priorities for Mr Faye - neither of which \"President Sall paid much attention to and it caught up with him\", Ms Tour\u00c3\u00a9 adds.\nShe is not the only political heavyweight to have thrown her support behind the 44-year-old - former President Abdoulaye Wade did the same just two days before Sunday's vote.\nIt is a remarkable turnaround for Mr Faye who spent the last 11 months in prison on charges of insurrection, and many more years before that in his ally's shadow.\n'Bassirou is me'\nBassirou Diomaye Faye was announced in February as the so-called \"Plan B\" candidate, replacing the charismatic opposition firebrand Ousmane Sonko. \"I would even say that he has more integrity than me,\" Mr Sonko said proudly.\nBoth men founded the now-disbanded Pastef party, both men are tax collectors, and both men found themselves jailed last year on charges they said were politically motivated.\nMr Sonko ended up being convicted of two offences, which meant he was barred from the election, so Mr Faye stepped in.\n\"Bassirou is me,\" Mr Sonko told supporters recently. \"They are two sides of the same coin,\" Pastef colleague Moustapha Sarr\u00c3\u00a9 agrees.\nThis has led to criticism that Mr Faye is merely \"president by default\".\nNot so, says analyst Mr Tine. But the pair's relationship could usher in a new style of leadership.\n\"Maybe they will establish a tandem and break away from the hyper-presidential model of having an all-powerful head of state.\n\"Sonko is of course the uncontested leader of Pastef - an icon, even... [But] the two have had a [dynamic of] complicity and collusion.\"\nOnce upon a time, Mr Faye wanted nothing to do with politics. \"It never crossed my mind,\" he said in 2019 while recalling his childhood.\nOne of Mr Faye's heroes is the late Senegalese historian Cheikh Anta Diop - whose work is seen as a precursor to Afrocentrism. Both are seen as left-wing cheerleaders for pan-Africanism.\nAs early results came in on Monday showing Mr Faye was set for victory, people in the capital, Dakar, celebrated by honking car horns and singing to loud music.\nThe reaction from international markets was less jubilant, with Senegal's dollar bonds falling to their lowest level in five months. Reuters news agency reports that investors are concerned Mr Faye's presidency may wind down the country's business-friendly policies.\n''By electing me, the Senegalese people have chosen to break with the past,\" he told journalists later on Monday. \"I promise to govern with humility and transparency.\"\nThe election was originally due last month but Mr Sall postponed it just hours before campaigning was set to begin, triggering deadly opposition protests and a democratic crisis.\nMost candidates had very little time to prepare once the new election date was set - but Mr Faye had just over a week after being freed from jail.\nDespite the shortened campaign period, Senegal's citizens were adamant they would turn out and use their vote, Christopher Fomunyoh - of",

    "A Conservative peer - and ex-adviser to Boris Johnson - has warned \"fleeceholds\" will be \"the next great scandal\" to hit the housing market.\nThe term is used to describe the plight of homeowners on new-build estates locked into private maintenance contracts for communal areas.\nMore than 40 Tory MPs have called for a ban on such contracts.\nLord Moylan, who advised Mr Johnson when he was London mayor, blamed councils for abandoning their duties.\n\"They will accept the additional council tax that is generated by the new properties but they will not take on the responsibilities for maintaining those common amenities,\" he told peers during the Lords' second reading of the bill.\nHe added: \"I think this is the next great scandal approaching the housing market.\"\nIt comes as 46 Tory MPs called on Housing Secretary Michael Gove to include a ban on \"fleeceholds\" to be included in the leasehold bill, which is working its way through Parliament.\nAbout four million people are thought to be living under the private estates model.\nThe \"estate fees\" emerge when a local council decides not to adopt the new area, leaving the builder - or more likely a third party management company - with responsibility for roads and green spaces.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has also recommended ending the private estates model, which has been used by for 40% of all new builds across Britain in the last five years, and recommending the mandatory adoption of public amenities on new housing estates by local councils.\nA leasehold is where homeowners do not own the land their property is built on but instead lease it from a landlord for as many as 999 years and are sometimes subject to ground rent and maintenance charges.\nMr Gove has labelled leaseholds \"an outdated feudal system that needs to go\", and the bill would ban the creation of new leasehold houses in England and Wales. However, it does not do the same for flats, which make up around 70% of leasehold homes.\nThe government has also consulted on capping ground rents to a \"peppercorn\" amount, which is intended to encourage landlords to sell up to leaseholders.\nBut there has been fierce opposition to reform of leaseholds, which still affect one-in-five homes in the UK, including from the Treasury, which claims altering contracts could be deeply damaging to investment.\nHousing minister Baroness Scott of Bybrook told peers the government recognised fleeceholds were a problem, saying \"it's not right\" for homeowners to be trapped in a contract with one management company, which may charge unreasonable fees, with no effective way to hold them to account.\nShe said: \"It is up to the developers and the local planning authority to agree on specific issues relating to new development, including appropriate funding and maintenance arrangements.\"\nHowever, she also said the government was \"carefully considering\" the CMA's report calling for an end to the private estates model.\nAs well as strengthening consumer protections, the CMA is also considering increasing the extent to which amenities are taken on by councils.\nSocial housing champion Lord Best called for a regulator of property agents to help address fleeceholds, among other leasehold issues.\nThe independent crossbench peer said: \"Sadly, there are all too many examples of mis-selling, exorbitant service charges, lack of transparency and accountability, overpriced leasehold management...\n\"The role of a new regulator of property agents would be to encourage and support the good, raise standards and drive out the bad.\"",

    "An investigation is under way after several vulnerable children were found onboard specialist school buses after the vehicles returned to their depots.\nLancashire County Council is looking into three incidents in which pupils were overlooked after all other passengers had been dropped off.\nIt relates to transport the council provides for children with special educational needs and disabilities.\nIt is understood the pupils were aged eight, 14 and 16.\nIt is not known where in the county the errors were made, nor whether they were all on journeys home from school or if some were on the way in or exactly how long the children remained onboard.\nHowever, the incidents have prompted the council to write to all staff who work on special educational needs and disabilities bus services reminding them of the need to follow what it describes as its \"robust safeguarding measures\".\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service understands the school attended by the 14-year-old was alerted after a short period of time by the teenager's family, while the eight-year-old and the 16-year-old were taken straight back to their schools when they were found.\nThe council said: \"We do have set procedures for school transport and for dropping off pupils.\n\"We have been in touch with the three families involved and offer our sincere apologies in those cases.\n\"From our position as a council, there is no valid excuse for not checking our buses.\n\"This matter has been taken very seriously and, as a result, these cases are being fully investigated and appropriate management action is being taken.\nEarlier this year, it emerged County Hall was forecasting that it would spend around \u00c2\u00a36m more than it had planned on the transport service in the current financial year.\nIt came as a result of what the authority described as \"significant increases\" in passenger numbers, along with the need to follow guidance which sets out the maximum journey times children should face each day.

    "Kate Garraway has said the cost of care for her late husband Derek Draper has left her with huge debts.\nShe was speaking in her latest documentary, Kate Garraway: Derek's Story. Draper died aged 56 from the long-term effects of Covid, in January.\nWhile acknowledging her job as a presenter on GMB was well-paid, Garraway said the \u00c2\u00a316,000-a-month care costs were more than her ITV salary.\nDraper is heard speaking on camera during the programme.\nIt is the first time he has been heard during the documentary series. He says: \"I want you to hear my story... I want to be heard.\"\nThe documentary focuses on the last year of his life, as Garraway highlights the problems in the care system.\nSpeaking before her husband's death, she said: \"Derek's care costs more than my salary from ITV and that is before you pay for a mortgage, before you pay any household bills, before you pay for anything for the kids, so we are at a crunch point.\n\"I am in debt. I can't earn enough money to cover my debt because I am managing Derek's care and I can't even use the money I do have to support Derek's recovery, because it's going on the basics all the time.\"\nShe added: \"I'm not going to pretend that I am poorly paid, I have an incredible job that I love, which is well-paid, but it's not enough.\"\nThe presenter has previously documented the impact of caring for her husband in two other ITV programmes - Finding Derek and Caring For Derek.\nIn the latest show, which airs on Tuesday evening on ITV, she says: \"Time and time again the system tell us that Derek isn't sick enough, doesn't have enough of a health need to qualify for funded care.\n\"I've appealed but that still hasn't been processed two-and-a-half, three years later.

    "A security guard thrust open the door of Antony Blinken's armoured car and the US secretary of state strode out down a line of yellow barricades.\n\"We're working to get them home,\" he declared, gripping the hands of Israeli protesters in Tel Aviv calling for a deal to release the hostages held by Hamas.\nIt was a striking moment but not altogether spontaneous.\nThe street had by now been buzzing with security officials readying his route towards the protesters.\nThose of us in the travelling press were told to expect the interaction in the 20 minutes or so leading up to it. It was firmly caught on camera.\nThis was a strong message from America's top diplomat to both the Israeli public and its prime minister - the US was committed, engaged and pushing everything to get a ceasefire-for-hostage-release deal over the line.\nIn other words the message is: The US is trying to stop the war - albeit with firm conditions.\nWashington has been under growing domestic and international pressure due to the unprecedented crisis unfolding in Gaza and the catastrophically high number of civilians killed.\nPresident Joe Biden and Mr Blinken have spent weeks now publicly ramping up pressure on Israel to surge more aid in, and they want to develop a plan to secure the territory's long-term future.\nBut as the crisis deepens, the limits of American influence have become increasingly clear.\nJust hours before the moment filmed at the barricades, the US had resorted to a vote in the UN Security Council to try to shape the actions of its ally.\nThis was a sign of President Biden's growing exasperation. The American-drafted text called on Israel to surge more aid into Gaza amid UN warnings of imminent famine.\nIt endorsed the current process mediated by Qatar to get a ceasefire in return for the release of hostages by Hamas.\nBut it also warned Israel against a military assault on the city of Rafah, home to more than 1.4 million displaced Palestinians, saying an offensive could violate international humanitarian law.\nThe resolution failed. It was vetoed by Russia and China.\nSpeaking at Ben Gurion airport on Friday afternoon, Mr Blinken castigated those who voted it down. He implied they did so for reasons that had nothing to do with the substance, while also warning that a Rafah offensive could leave Israel without international support.\n\"It risks killing more civilians, it risks wreaking greater havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance, it risks further isolating Israel around the world and jeopardising its long term security and standing,\" he said.\nAmid the growing rift between Washington and the Israeli leader, Mr Netanyahu struck back at Mr Blinken's assessment.\n\"I told him I hope we'll do it with the support of the United States,\" said the prime minister, \"but if we have to, we'll do it alone\".\nThis was a superpower being pushed back, despite its pressure.\n'More humanitarian aid needs to be allowed in'\nI've seen the phenomenal force of US diplomacy at close quarters this week, trailing Mr Blinken on a time-zone shattering tour of Europe, Asia and ending in the Middle East trying to stem the current crisis.\nTo America's critics the paradox is clear: the US is sending weapons to a key ally, while at the same time urging it, without success, to do much more to alleviate the civilian suffering the military action has unleashed.\nA UN-backed food security assessment this week said 1.1 million people in Gaza were struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation, adding that a man-made famine in the north was imminent between now and May.\nA growing number of US politicians have also spoken out. This week a group of Democratic senators and nearly 70 former US officials, diplomats and military officers said President Biden should consider cutting weapons supplies to Israel if it keeps restricting humanitarian aid to Gaza.\nIsrael blames the UN for a failure to distribute supplies. The UN categorically rejects this but Israel insists that checkpoint restrictions and attacks on police securing aid convoys have been a necessary part of its campaign to eliminate Hamas.\nI asked Mr Blinken in Manilla whether the security vacuum in Gaza was a harbinger of its future. How could he convince Israel to accept the his proposals?\nHamas could end the suffering tomorrow, he said, if it surrendered. But he reiterated that more humanitarian aid had to be allowed in.\nAnswering my question, he gave a US endorsement for the first time to a UN-backed measure on hunger, saying \"100% of the population in Gaza is at severe levels of acute food insecurity. That's the first time an entire population has been so classified.\"\nMuch of Mr Blinken's trip was crisis management. Trying to get aid into Gaza, get the hostages out and secure an end to the conflict, which the US says must ensure Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October \"can never happen again\".\nAt the same time it is trying to shape a post-war future. Washington wants the Palestinian Authority running Gaza. ",

    "It is a crowded field of 17 in the battle for Senegal's top job, but two men - recently freed opposition politician Bassirou Diomaye Faye and the ruling party's heir apparent Amadou Ba - look most likely to win over voters in Sunday's presidential election.\nTheir rivalry underpins a massive divide and clash of outlook in the country, usually regarded as a beacon of democracy in West Africa, especially over its relationship with France, the former colonial power.\nThe poll is a rushed job - the date was announced with less than three weeks' notice, following a month of confusion and violent protests.\nWhat seems to unite most Senegalese is the anger directed at outgoing President Macky Sall who tried to postpone the election - originally scheduled for 25 February - until December.\nMr Sall has told the BBC he acted to protect the integrity of the vote after allegations of corruption and disputes over the eligibility of some presidential candidates.\nHowever, critics accused him of seeking to extend his term in office or stop the clock to better prepare his candidate - which he denies.\nIt led to political turmoil, the intervention of the Constitutional Court, the president agreeing to leave office next month when his term officially ends, and a new election date.\nThen last week, some of his fiercest critics - those involved in political protests over the last few years - were freed in a presidential amnesty in order to calm tensions.\nThis included firebrand opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, who came third in the last election and is hugely popular with young people eager for change.\nBut the 49-year-old is barred from running as a candidate this time, due to a series of charges he says were politically motivated.\nInstead, he is throwing his considerable clout behind Mr Faye, who like him is a former tax inspector and was released from detention at the same time - he was awaiting trial on charges of defamation and spreading fake news.\nThe two met while working at the tax office and Mr Faye, who turns 44 the day after the election, was previously secretary-general of Mr Sonko's Pastef party, which was dissolved by the government last year over allegations it had called for an insurrection.\nTheir slogan \"Sonko is Diomaye, Diomaye is Sonko\" has gone viral on social media in the last week.\nThe pair - greeted on their release by celebrating crowds - are pushing their anti-establishment vision for institutional reforms. It is an Afrocentric and nationalist agenda, including plans to renegotiate the country's mining and energy contracts.\nMr Faye also wants Senegal to stop using the CFA franc - the West African single currency that is pegged to the euro, with the financial backing of the French treasury, and which is regarded by his supporters as a relic of the colonial era.\nThe proposal has been labelled as irresponsible by his opponents, although Mr Sonko has sought to quell such fears by saying they would seek to reform the regional currency first and only consider introducing a national currency if that should fail.\nIn contrast to this radical path, Mr Ba, prime minister until he resigned to contest the election, seeks to represent continuity and stability.\nAt his rallies, the 62-year-old has hit out at the former Pastef pair, labelling them \"bandits\" and saying a vote for him is a vote for \"greater peace and prosperity\".\nHe argues his ministerial track record proves he will oversee development and create one million jobs in five years - as the staid statesman woos the youth vote.\nMr Ba may have been on the political scene for the last decade, but he is a bit of a closed book for most. He has tried to open up as a man of the people, revealing his love for reggae music and Bob Marley.\nWith more than half of Senegal's population under the age of 25 and growing frustration over unemployment and boats full of migrants heading for Europe, it is an important demographic.\nArame Gueye Sene, executive director of the youth group Social Change Factory, told the BBC that young people were engaged in campaign issues, although the majority of the seven million registered voters were aged 35 and over.\n\"We see them on the streets, but we're not sure that a lot of them are able to vote next Sunday,\" she said.\nA significant challenge for all candidates has been that the postponed election has fallen in the middle of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.\nIn Senegal, 95% of the population is Muslim and consequently key cities like the capital, Dakar, and Thi\u00c3\u00a8s are unusually quiet for an election campaign.\nPeople tend to save their energy until they break their fast at sunset, meaning candidates are having to rethink their campaign strategies.\nBooklets detailing proposed policies have been shared online, as well as live recordings of rallies.\n\"We have to double efforts to mobilise voters,\" Anta Babacar Ngom, a business executive and the only woman in this race, told the BBC.\nCandidates are still making an effort to tour the country - as Mo",

    "A passenger was injured when a tram derailed after the driver did not notice a problem with the track, an investigation has found.\nThe tram struck a pole supporting equipment during the derailment in Nottingham, dislodging a pane of glass that then struck the passenger.\nThe derailment happened because a set of points had not reset correctly after two other trains went over them.\nThere was an indicator to warn about this, but the driver did not spot it.\nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), in its summary of the investigation, said: \"The driver believed that they would be informed if there were any issues with a set of points, but had not been so on this occasion.\n\"The driver had probably become conditioned to there being no issues at this location and was also possibly distracted.\"\nThe accident happened at 17:06 BST on 12 June , at the north end of the Bulwell tram stop.\nIt caused significant damage to the tram and infrastructure, and the line was closed until 23 June .\nThe investigation report states: \"During the derailment, the tram struck and demolished a pole that supported overhead line equipment.\n\"This impact deformed the door frame sufficiently to allow a pane of glass to be released, which struck a passenger on the back and head.\n\"Other passengers were knocked on to the floor of the tram.\"\nThe investigation found Nottingham Trams Limited did not have an effective policy in place to inform drivers of points failures, and had not specifically assessed the risk of a driver incorrectly passing a lineside indicator.\nThe RAIB made three recommendations:\nThe RAIB said it had also \"identified a learning point to remind tram drivers to not make assumptions about the status of signals or indicators based on their previous experience\".\nNottingham Trams Limited has been asked to comment.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "Former sub-postmasters and politicians have called for the Post Office to face a police investigation after BBC News revealed the company knew of flaws in its Horizon IT system.\nA document shows bosses and lawyers knew of issues in 2017 , but kept arguing sub-postmasters were to blame.\nKevan Jones MP, who advises ministers on Post Office compensation, said \"the police need to start looking at this\".\nThe Post Office earlier said it would be \"inappropriate to comment\".\nMore than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 due to supposed losses flagged by the faulty Horizon IT system used in its branches.\nBetween 2018 and 2019, the Post Office was taken to court by 555 sub-postmasters led by Alan Bates, who successfully argued they had been wrongly prosecuted.\nAn internal draft report obtained by the BBC reveals the Post Office knew in 2017 that the Horizon programme could be flawed.\nThe draft report refers to findings being discussed with \"Post Office management\" and investigators at the time.\nDespite that, the Post Office continued to defend the costly case with \u00c2\u00a3100m of public money.\nMr Jones, a Labour MP who sits on the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, described the Post Office's actions in the 2018-19 court case as \"an abusive use of public cash against innocent people\".\nHe told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme: \"I do now think the police need to start looking at this. More will obviously come out at the public inquiry but there's enough out there now to start looking.\n\"Unless people are brought before a court of law and asked what they knew and why they took such actions, then that won't be justice.\"\nThe draft report, which was commissioned by the Post Office in March 2016 and compiled by accountancy firm Deloitte, was not disclosed during the court case.\nLawyers for Tim Parker, who was chair of the Post Office at the time, told the BBC the Post Office's legal team liaised with Deloitte about the report and were responsible for handling, distributing and disclosing it.\nHe said the Post Office's lawyers were also involved in the \"strategy and day to day management of the litigation\".\nThis raises questions as to whether Post Office lawyers met their responsibilities to not mislead the court.\nMr Jones continued: \"If [Post Office lawyers] knew about it, surely they've put themselves in a very difficult position in terms of their legal obligation to release all information to the court.\"\nTory peer Lord Arbuthnot, who has been a vocal campaigner on behalf of sub-postmasters, said he believes some connected with the scandal deserve a \"long spell in jail\".\nHe described the handling of the Alan Bates court case as \"a perversion of the course of justice\".\nTwo former sub-postmasters who were part of that landmark case said they wanted the police to investigate the matter.\nLee Castleton - who was forced into bankruptcy after wrongly being taken to court by the Post Office - said: \"It really is 'how low can they go' time.\n\"I hope it drives more impetus in the police to start to investigate wider than just scape goats.\"\nJanet Skinner, who was jailed for nine months in 2007, described the findings of the investigation as \"gut-wrenching and sickening\".\nShe told BBC Radio 4: \"They sent people to prison with no evidence - and the amount of evidence that's going against them now, there needs to be this form of investigation.\"\nA spokesperson for Mr Parker said he had \"sought, considered, and acted upon the legal advice he was given\" as chair.\nFujitsu Group - which manufactured the Horizon software - said it was fully cooperating with the public inquiry and will be working with the UK government on \"appropriate actions, including contribution to compensation\".\nA Post Office spokesperson said in response to the BBC investigation: \"We are deeply sorry for the impact of the Horizon IT Scandal on so many people's lives and continue to pay redress to victims as swiftly as possible, with \u00c2\u00a3179m paid to around 2,800 Postmasters to date.\n\"Alongside financial redress for victims, there must also be accountability. The best forum to achieve this is the statutory public inquiry, chaired by a judge with the power to question witnesses under oath. The next phases of the inquiry will examine the issues raised here and it would be inappropriate to comment outside of that process.\"\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "A baby murdered by his parents 39 days after being placed back into their care \"should have been one of the most protected children\", a review has said.\nStephen Boden and Shannon Marsden were jailed for killing Finley Boden, who died on Christmas Day in 2020.\nA safeguarding review said there were \"significant shortcomings\" in the care of Finley, who suffered 130 \"appalling\" injuries at the hands of his parents.\nAuthorities involved in Finley's care have apologised.\nThe local child safeguarding practice review, published on Wednesday, details key findings and makes a number of recommendations for future improvements.\nThe review identified pandemic lockdown restrictions as a major factor in helping the parents deceive authorities, but added opportunities to intervene were missed.\nThe report said Boden and Marsden were known drug users and Boden had already served time in prison for violent and threatening behaviour.\nFinley was returned to their care on 17 November, following a family court hearing on 1 October, despite concerns over Boden and Marsden's drug use and the state of the family home.\nThe report said Finley, who was killed when he was 10 months old, was \"completely dependent on their parents for all aspects of their care\" and as a result \"there were many risks inherent in this situation\".\n\"This was not adequately understood,\" the report added.\nFinley Boden report: The key findings\nOverall, the report stated that while Finley's parents were responsible for his death, \"professional interventions should have protected him\".\nSteve Atkinson, the DDSCP's independent chairman and scrutineer, said: \"The report acknowledges there were significant mitigating circumstances in the period leading up to Finley's death - the Covid lockdowns, the very restricted access, unfamiliar working circumstances and remote meetings and parental dishonesty and disengaging.\n\"However, these are not excuses. More could, and should, have been done to help keep Finley safe.\n\"In accepting the recommendations of the review in full, partners are committed to taking all action necessary to reduce the risk of something similar happening again.\"\nDerbyshire County Council's children's services accepted there had been \"missed opportunities\" in Finley's case.\nCarol Cammiss, executive director for children's services, said: \"Finley's death was a tragedy for everyone who knew him and everyone involved in his care.\n\"Despite the significant Covid restrictions placed on our work at the time, we know there were missed opportunities for stronger practice and we apologise for that.\n\"We did not wait for the outcome of this review - we took immediate action to review and strengthen our systems and continue to monitor the way we work with babies and families.\"\nCafcass - the independent Children and Families Court Advisory Service - employed Finley's guardian for the family court proceedings, and was involved in the decision to return him to his parents.\nIt said it was \"profoundly sorry that together we were unable to prevent\" Finley's death and blamed his parents' deception.\nA spokesperson said: \"When it was decided in October 2020 that Finley should live with and be in the care of his parents, everyone involved - including his guardian - believed his parents had made and sustained the changes necessary to care for him safely.\n\"What led to his death was the ability of Finley's parents to deceive everyone involved, about their love for him and their desire to care for him.\n\"No-one could have predicted from what was known at the time that they were capable of such cruelty or that there was a risk that they would intentionally hurt him, let along murder him.\"\nThe murder trial, held at Derby Crown Court, previously heard Boden and Marsden cancelled a health visitor appointment two days before Finley died, and refused to let social services in during an unannounced visit, saying that he may have Covid-19.\nThe court was told Finley suffered injuries - including 57 breaks to his bones - at the hands of his parents.\nFinley also suffered 71 bruises and two burns on his left hand - one \"from a hot, flat surface\", the other probably from \"a cigarette lighter flame\".\nIf you have been affected by any of these issues, you can visit the BBC Action Line .\nParamedics were called to the couple's home in Holland Road, Old Whittington, in the early hours of Christmas Day after Finley suffered a cardiac arrest.\nHe was taken to hospital and was later pronounced dead.\nA judge said the murder was \"savage and prolonged\" with a \"sadistic motivation\".\nBoden and Marsden were ordered to serve a minimum of 29 and 27 years respectively.\nAnalysis\nBy Phil Mackie, BBC News Midlands correspondent\nToday's report makes depressing reading for two reasons.\nFirst, many of the failings it identifies have been highlighted many times in other safeguarding reviews in relation to different children.\nIt also shows how the warnings that were made at the time that vulnerable children would be plac",

    "US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has announced Silicon Valley lawyer and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan as his running mate.\nMs Shanahan, 38, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has never before run for political office.\nMr Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and scion of America's most famous political dynasty, is running as an independent.\nNaming a VP pick is a prerequisite to be on the ballot in a number of states.\nThe Kennedy campaign has ruffled Democrats, who are concerned about its spoiler potential on President Joe Biden's re-election chances.\nOn Tuesday Mr Kennedy embraced that label, calling his campaign \"a spoiler for President Biden and for President Trump\" that will \"forge an unstoppable coalition of homeless Democrats and homeless Republicans\".\nThe Democratic National Committee has recently stepped up attacks on Mr Kennedy, arguing that his longshot third-party bid will only end up helping to elect the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.\nMs Shanahan was unveiled on Tuesday by Mr Kennedy at a rally in Oakland, California, where he described her as a \"fellow lawyer, a brilliant scientist, technologist, a fierce warrior mom\".\nShe has previously been a longtime Democratic donor and has already donated to Mr Kennedy's campaign. She said in her remarks that she was leaving the Democratic Party, because it had \"lost its way\" by focusing on \"elitism\" and \"winning at all costs\".\n\"I believe I am taking the best ideals and impulses with me,\" she said.\nMr Kennedy, 70, described his new running mate as someone with a deep inside knowledge of Big Tech, which he depicted as a threat to democracy.\nHe told the crowd he picked a younger running mate partly because he wants her to be a champion for millennial and Gen-Z Americans. He said those generations had lost hope for their future and no longer believe the political establishment has their best interests at heart.\nMr Kennedy was introduced at the event by his wife, Cheryl Hines, the star of HBO comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm.\nMr Kennedy previously challenged Mr Biden for the Democratic party's nomination, before launching an independent bid last October.\nNaming Ms Shanahan as his vice-presidential nominee will help his campaign clear the way for ballot access in many US states and Washington DC.\nHis campaign has to navigate a wide variety of state rules to get his name on the ballot.\nOn Monday, Mr Kennedy threatened legal action against Nevada after state officials suggested signatures his campaign has gathered to qualify for the ballot there could be invalid, as he had not confirmed a running mate at the time they were filed.\nSo far, Mr Kennedy is only confirmed to be on the ballot in Utah.\nMs Shanahan's humble origins will serve as a contrast to Mr Kennedy and his famous political family.\nThe daughter of a Chinese immigrant mother and a white father, she grew up in Oakland and was raised on food stamps, a federal subsidy that helps low-income families buy groceries.\nShe's previously recalled her childhood as being filled with fear and instability because of her dad's schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\nMs Shanahan has supported criminal justice reform, affordable housing and efforts to fight climate change and to increase access to mental health treatment.\nShe is the founder and president of Bia-Echo Foundation, a charitable organisation focused on fertility and human health.\nIn February, Ms Shanahan acknowledged partially funding a Super Bowl ad released by Mr Kennedy's campaign.\nThe ad was a remake of a 1960 one that was part of the White House campaign run by his uncle, President John F Kennedy.\nThe Super Bowl ad drew disapproval, including from members of RFK Jr's family, who criticised his vaccine scepticism.\nThe BBC spoke with half a dozen of Ms Shanahan's former and current colleagues before Tuesday's announcement.\nThey described her as a compassionate leader and a champion of social causes.\nWhile most did not realise she was considering a political career, they were surprised but not shocked to see her name floated as Mr Kennedy's vice-presidential nominee.\n\"She's motivated by trying to change things for the better and having an impact on social benefits,\" said Roland Vogl, executive director of Stanford University's Center for Legal Informatics, where Ms Shanahan has been a fellow.\nThey say her political inexperience and age should not count against her and that voters should be open to new leaders.\n\"Don't undersell someone who comes from outside a system to change the system,\" Bruce Cahan, a professional colleague, said.\nMr Kennedy's campaign previously floated other names on the running mate shortlist, including American football star Aaron Rodgers, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, and former Democratic presidential candidates Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard.\nMr Kennedy has insisted he is unfazed by the political uphill battle he faces.\nThe last president to win without the backing of a major party ",

    "Russia has charged four men it says attacked a Moscow concert hall and killed at least 137 people.\nAll four appeared to have been beaten and one was brought to court in a wheelchair. They were charged with committing an act of terrorism.\nThe Islamic State group, or IS, said it carried out Friday's outrage at Crocus City Hall and posted video evidence.\nRussian officials have claimed, without evidence, Ukrainian involvement. Kyiv says the claim is \"absurd\".\nOn Monday - three days after the attack - Russian President Vladimir Putin told senior officials \"we know that the crime was committed by the hands of radical Islamists, followers of an ideology that the Islamic world itself has been fighting against for centuries\".\nBut he also insisted that the attackers were linked to the Ukrainian government. He had said so in his first reaction, on Saturday, claiming Kyiv had \"prepared a window\" to allow them to cross the border and escape into its territory.\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky angrily dismissed that claim, saying it was \"absolutely predictable\" that Vladimir Putin would blame it on Ukraine \"instead of dealing with his Russian citizens, addressing them\".\nOn Monday Mr Putin claimed Kyiv - what he called \"the neo-Nazi regime\" - was behind the attack because it wanted to \"sow panic in our society and at the same time show their own population that all is not lost for the Kiev [Kyiv] regime\".\nGraphic video released by IS, showing attackers firing on the crowd inside the concert hall, has been verified as genuine by the BBC.\nOn Friday night, four gunmen stormed the Crocus City Hall in Krasnogorsk, a northern Moscow suburb, and began firing on some of the estimated 6,000 people who were attending a rock concert. The attackers also set fires which engulfed the venue and caused the roof to collapse.\nRussian authorities said 137 people were killed and more than 100 injured, with 60 still in a serious condition.\nRescuers are continuing to search the rubble of the concert hall for victims, and regional officials said the operation would carry on through Tuesday afternoon.\nThe men who appeared in court on Sunday were arrested in the Bryansk region around 14 hours after the attack, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said. Bryansk is around 400km (250 miles) south-west of Moscow.\nThe four suspects were named by Russian authorities as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov.\nVideo showed three of them being marched bent double by masked police into Basmanny district court in the Russian capital.\nVideos of brutal interrogation sessions were apparently leaked by Russian security forces, and reports suggest at least one had suffered electric shocks.\nAsked about the alleged torture, Mr Peskov refused to comment.\nThe men the court identified as Mirzoyev and Rachabalizoda had black eyes and the latter's ear was heavily bandaged - reportedly from it being partially severed during his arrest.\nMirzoyev also appeared to have a torn plastic bag wrapped around his neck.\nThe face of the man identified as Fariduni was badly swollen, while the man named as Fayzov appeared to lose consciousness as he was brought into court in a wheelchair wearing a thin hospital gown.\nHe appeared to have an eye missing, according to the Reuters news agency.\nAll were held in a glass-panelled booth and guarded by masked police during their time in court.\nA court statement on the Telegram messaging service said Mirzoyev had \"admitted his guilt in full\", while Rachabalizoda also \"admitted guilt\". The court also said the four will be held in pre-trial detention until at least 22 May,\nThe men were identified as citizens of Tajikistan, Russia's state news agency Tass said.\nTen other people have been arrested in Russia suspected of aiding the attack, including three on Monday afternoon.\nRussia in IS crosshairs\nThe US warned Moscow earlier this month of a possible attack in Russia aimed at large gatherings before issuing a public advisory to citizens in the country.\nThe alert was roundly dismissed by the Kremlin as propaganda and an attempt to meddle in its presidential election.\nWashington said after the attack that it had no reason to doubt the IS claim.\nIt would not be the first time IS and its allies have attacked Russia or its interests abroad.\nThe group claimed the bombing of a Russian aircraft over Egypt in 2015 with 224 people on board, most of them Russian citizens. It also claimed a 2017 bomb attack on the St Petersburg metro, which killed 15 people.\nSecurity analysts say the group considers Russia a primary target for a number of reasons, including the country's role in destroying IS's powerbase in Syria while securing President Bashar al-Assad's rule, Moscow's two brutal wars in Muslim-majority Chechnya in 1994-2009 and the Soviet-era invasion of Afghanistan.\nThe US and other Western intelligence agencies have said the attack was probably carried out by the Khorasan branch of IS,",
    "Work has got under way to create a new \"environment-friendly\" crematorium in Bradford.\nThe site in Bierley will replace the existing facility at Scholemoor.\nBradford Council said its existing facilities were past their recommended life span and did not meet modern environmental standards.\nCouncillor Sarah Ferriby said the authority's plan was to \"create a modern, sustainable and environment-friendly bereavement service\".\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service , the new crematorium, off Shetcliffe Lane, will have new service halls including a small venue for intimate services of around 25-30 people,\u00c2\u00a0a large hall for 250-300 people, car parking, new cremators, office space and a waiting room.\nPlans for the crematorium were approved in 2021 despite a large number of objections from residents who feared the facility would lead to traffic problems, spoil the landscape and increase pollution.\nLegal restrictions on where crematoria can be built - not within 200 yards of a home and 50 yards of a public road - meant there were\u00c2\u00a0few sites in Bradford where the new facilities could be built, a meeting heard back in 2020.\nSite preparation was now under way, Bradford Council confirmed.\nLast year another new crematorium in Heaton, Shay Grange, opened to replace Nab Wood Crematorium.\nBoth developments form part of Bradford Council's Bereavement Services Strategy, which aims to modernise and upgrade the district's cemeteries and crematoria.\nNew emissions rules meant much bigger cremation ovens were required.\nThe Muslim burial ground at Scholemoor Cemetery has also been extended and an extension to the burial provision at Bowling Cemetery is under way.\nWork on the Bierley site is expected to finish in 2025.\u00c2\u00a0Once open, Scholemoor Crematorium will close, but the cemetery will remain open.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

But from 6 April they will be free in England and Wales.\nOlu from London said being able to apply for free \"was like a light switch in a dark place for me.\"\nAfter being made redundant during the pandemic, she struggled to find work and ended up trying to pay her debts through a credit card.\n\"Honestly I didn't have the money to pay for anything, so that \u00c2\u00a390 was like another stumbling block for me,\" she said.\n\"I was lacking joy, I was lacking peace, everything seems like a dark place,\" she said. But she said she had hope for the future again, knowing that her application will now be at the top of the pile,\nWhat is a Debt Relief Order?\nIn recent years DROs have been an increasingly important tool for those struggling the most.\nIn 2023, some 31,717 DROs were granted in England and Wales - more than at any other point in the last five years.\nThis year has seen an even more dramatic jump in numbers. January of this year saw a 60% increase in the number of DROs granted compared with January 2023.\nIn February, the number of DROs increased by 44% compared with the same month in 2023.\nCitizen's Advice said up until now nine in 10 of the people they helped apply for a DRO had struggled to cover the \u00c2\u00a390 fee, with many being priced out of insolvency.\n\"It's really welcome news but it's not job done,\" said Rachel Beddow, principle policy manager at Citizens Advice.\nShe said she was concerned debt advice organisations were not being given any extra resource to meet the extra demand they are expecting.\nJessie in Bridgnorth knows only too well how hard it is to get \u00c2\u00a390 together.\n\"That doesn't seem a lot to some people but to me that's two week's worth of shopping,\" she said.\nAfter a marriage breakdown, with four children to care for, her finances got out of control.

    "The video announcement from the Princess of Wales, unprecedented in its own way, is a poignant reminder of how badly she's needed by the monarchy.\nShe's been their dash of glamour in a greying royal world. And on a park bench in jumper and jeans, she's sent a moving message about her cancer that will connect with many families that have faced similar moments.\nShe's really been missed on the royal stage. They'll want her back.\nThe palace will also fervently hope that the shift towards a greater openness about her health will be the point at which the speculation about her stops.\nThe conspiracy theories about her whereabouts fed on an information vacuum, but now there's a much clearer account of what's happened since her operation in January.\nThe outburst of rumour-mongering has been a bruising time for Catherine and Prince William - and the disclosure about her cancer diagnosis rewrites what's happened in the past few weeks.\nIt all looks very different in retrospect. That creaking is the sound of a lot of necks being wound back in.\nHer chemotherapy began in late February - and now we know the discovery of her cancer was the reason behind Prince William's last-minute absence from his godfather's memorial service.\nThose other moments of frenzied social media speculation - the edited Mother's Day photo and the video of the couple out shopping, with the claims of a body double - all came after Catherine was undergoing chemotherapy.\nThe palace is calling for privacy and wants to draw a line under the media storm of recent weeks.\nIt seems like a very long time ago that there was talk of a need for a slimmed down monarchy.\nWith King Charles also undergoing cancer treatment it means there are now very depleted ranks of senior royals.\nCatherine and Prince William are now not expected to appear with the Royal Family on Easter Sunday, and there won't be any early return to official duties for the princess.\nAnd next week's Maundy Thursday service, a fixture in the royal calendar, will see Queen Camilla standing in for King Charles.\nShe has been leading the line for the royals for the past few months, increasingly carrying out trips on her own that would once have been responsibility of her husband.\nTrooping the Colour in June will now be a case of \"to be confirmed\" in terms of who will attend.\nAnd international trips, such as connecting with the Commonwealth, seem very much on hold.\nPrince William has kept up his projects such as Earthshot and Homewards, but is likely to limit his travels, in his bid to stay close to home and to protect some kind of normal family life.\nBut this video is a reminder of why they'll want to see Catherine back and fully recovered. There's a disarming straightforwardness to this conversation on a bench, spring flowers in the background. It was almost the opposite of edited.\nShe gave a sobering message but with a positive expectation of getting well and recovering soon.\nIt could be many of us. As she said in her message, she was thinking of the many families who have been affected by cancer.\nThose families will know that finding a loved one has cancer makes you stop and take stock and put other things in perspective.\n\"For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope,\" Catherine said. \"You are not alone.\"",
    "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has offered no new commitment to secure train manufacturing in Derby.\nThe boss of train builder Alstom told the BBC earlier this week the last train on a big order was complete, as 3,000 jobs were put at risk.\nMr Sunak was in Langley Mill in Derbyshire to launch the Conservative party's local election campaign.\nHe said the government was looking to \"support the supply chain and make sure there is a good pipeline of work\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday, Nick Crossfield, managing director of Alstom UK & Ireland, said the possible job losses would have a \"considerable\" impact on the national supply chain - understood to affect a further 15,000 jobs - many in Derbyshire.\nHe said the company could no longer guarantee a presence at their Litchurch Lane site because the main production had finished, with an 18-month gap until the next order.\nThe BBC understands if the site was to close, the UK would be the only nation in the G7 that does not have a site able to design, develop and manufacture trains.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Derby on Friday, Mr Sunak said: \"I know it will be a concerning time for everyone both at the plant and more generally and that's why we've set up a cross-government taskforce to make sure the appropriate support is in place for the workers.\n\"Without being able to comment on commercial conversations, the government is doing everything it can to support the supply chain and make sure there is a good pipeline of work.\n\"The transport secretary has been involved in constructive dialogue for a while with Alstom and we want to make sure we have fantastic opportunities for everyone to participate in.\"\nAn Alstom spokesperson said: \"We continue to work constructively with the government on securing a sustainable future for Derby Litchurch Lane, but after 10 months of discussions, we have all but run out of time, and need to provide the much-needed certainty to our Derby staff and supply chain.\"\nParesh Patel, regional secretary for Unite East Midlands, added there were \"clearly\" now gaps in production and that the workforce was \"frustrated\" and \"angry\".\nHe said: \"We're calling on government and we're calling on Alstom to get their heads together and get the deal done. There is a deal on the table that we believe can be signed and can start delivering work through the factory gates.\"\nMaternity inquiry\nMeanwhile, the prime minister also declined to commit to a public inquiry into maternity services during his visit to the East Midlands.\nMr Sunak was asked about Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust's maternity services.\nExperienced midwife Donna Ockenden is running what is thought to be the largest review into maternity services in NHS history in Nottingham, involving the cases of\u00c2\u00a01,813 families.\nThere have been further calls for a UK-wide inquiry.\nThe University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust's maternity services are currently rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).\nWhen asked if he would commit to a public inquiry, Mr Sunak said: \"I'm not as familiar with the specific details of what has happened, I was just talking to Ben [Bradley] about it.\n\"My understanding is that there has been a review of maternity services.\n\"More generally what we have done is to invest around \u00c2\u00a3150m extra in strengthening maternity services across the country because it is incredibly important.\n\"We have had incidences in different areas where services have not been at the standard that any of us would expect or that people deserve.\n\"I'm sure the health trust here will take on board all the recommendations of the report and make sure patients get the care they need.\"\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "The first UK-funded field hospital in Gaza aims to be fully functioning in days, with treatment for everything from minor illnesses to bullet wounds.\nIt has been set up by the aid organisation UK-Med, which deploys many NHS staff to international emergencies.\nThe facility is based near Rafah, where 1.5 million Palestinians are crammed in, having fled other parts of Gaza.\n\"The scale of the need is simply staggering,\" UK-Med's chief executive David Wightwick told the BBC\nHe was speaking over the noise of hammering and banging as construction continued in the desert sands of Al Mawasi.\n\"There are very few services of any kind and the health services have been eroded to the extent that if you are sick, if you are ill, if you are wounded, you are in a very difficult situation.\"\nThe field hospital - which was despatched from Manchester - will eventually cover the size of two football fields, but getting started hasn't been easy.\nWhen the UK-Med trucks were held up at the border, David and his team began building with local timber from destroyed buildings.\n\"It took a lot of negotiation to get land, and it took a lot of negotiation to get things across the border,\" he said.\n\"It's been a challenge to find staff. It has been a challenge to communicate, none of the phones work, none of the internet works, and everything somehow has to be made to work in order to bring essential urgent life-saving services to people.\"\nThe team are already seeing about 100 outpatients a day at the field hospital and expect to double that soon.\nUK-Med is already running mobile clinics that go out into the community in Gaza. \"They have definitely seen cases of acute malnutrition in very young children,\" David said.\nA surgical team from the aid group has been working in the chaos of the Al Aqsa hospital - the only hospital functioning in the centre of the Gaza Strip.\nThe wards and corridors are teeming with patients, and with families seeking shelter, who have bedded down on the floor. It's hard to get a trolley through, but when we visited, a 12-year-old boy called Anas was on his way to surgery with a broken leg and wounds to his face.\nAnas said that he was playing when his neighbourhood was bombed.\nHe was injured, and his mother and six-month-old baby brother were killed. \"May God have mercy on their souls,\" he said.\nUK-Med orthopaedic trauma surgeon Saba Papuashvili was waiting for Anas in the operating room. \"He's a brave boy,\" he said.\nThe surgery went well. Anas will recover but the team have seen some of the worst that war can do, according to anaesthetist Judith Kendall.\n\"I have worked in many warzones over the past nine years,\" she told the BBC. \"I think what shocked me about this particular context is the number of children injured that we are seeing, and the extent of those injuries. They are life-changing injuries that a child will have to live with.\"\nGaza's hospitals aren't just overwhelmed. They are often under attack from Israeli forces. Israel claims that Hamas used hospitals as cover - a claim denied by health officials and medical staff.\nThe UK-Med team understand the danger, said Mark Shaw, from West Yorkshire, who has previously worked in Ukraine.\n\"We recognise the risks, and we accept the risk which is why we are here in a humanitarian sense,\" he said. \"The worst injuries we are seeing are the amputations, and blast injures, especially in young children.\"\nBack in Al Mawasi, more trucks have arrived, and another hangar has been erected.\nIf there is ground invasion in Rafah - as Israel is threatening - the British field hospital could be crucial.",
    "Churches are places where people gather to hear the word of God but in one south Belfast church holy words are signed.\nKinghan Church, on Botanic Avenue, is a worshipping community for those who are deaf and hearing-impaired.\n'KC', as it is affectionately known, was founded in 1857 by Rev John Kinghan, a Presbyterian minister who became the principal of the Ulster Society for the Promotion of the Education of the Deaf, the Dumb and the Blind in Belfast.\nAbout 1898, the church moved from its site on the city's Sandy Row to its current location before going through extensive renovation and remodelling in the early 1990s.\nFor more than 150 years, the church has provided an escape from isolation for those in the deaf community.\n'It feels like home'\nMary Carson, from Belfast, has been attending Kinghan Church since she was a child and describes it as \"feeling like home\".\n\"I've been coming to KC from the age of eight and I still come now, I have been coming all those years,\" she said.\n\"I don't know if you want to know what age I am but I'm actually 82 years old.\"\nMary says she loves the church and is grateful for all it offers.\n\"When I come here, it's just so easy to chat to everyone because everyone is like me, they are deaf,\" she said.\n\"There is a lovely happy atmosphere and we get on so well together and honestly it's where I feel so much love coming to me from KC.\"\nMary says the rest of the congregation are her \"best friends\"; many of whom she has known most her life.\n\"Obviously over the years some people have passed on but then new people come and there is younger people who come in and I really enjoy that as well.\"\n'I should be retired'\nRev Will Murphy began his ministry with deaf people almost 45 years ago but he is the first to admit he did not at first believe it would be a lifelong ministry.\n\"I thought I would do maybe 12 years in ministry, my predecessor had done eight but it just continued,\" he said.\n\"I should be retired X years ago but I am still doing it, still loving it because they are a loving community.\"\nRev Murphy said it was odd to leave music and singing behind for this \"totally different atmosphere\" but he quickly found it had \"a warmth of its own\".\n\"I came from a hearing community, from a hearing church, I had never met a deaf person,\" he said.\n\"My first task was to learn sign language, which to be honest I am still learning.\"\nRev Murphy said the church is a great place for overcoming the isolation that so many deaf people feel.\n\"They come together not just for worship, but for tea, coffee and friendship and fellowship.\"\nHowever, Rev Murphy admits there are some differences when it comes to giving a service to the deaf community.\n\"If a deaf person closes their eyes, end of contact with the service,\" he said.\n\"In a hearing church you can close your eyes and continue to listen but if you see that happening it's time to shut up and get out and finish the service.\"\nIn the intervening years, Rev Murphy said there have been great advances in communication with the mobile phone being the biggest.\n\"When I came to ministry to contact a deaf person at home you would phone the next door neighbour.\"\nRev Murphy said the mobile had \"revolutionised the life of deaf people\".\nCODA\nRosie Budd has been coming to Kinghan Church for her whole life.\nShe was christened there, she was married there, she had been a committee member there but she is not deaf.\nRosie grew up as a CODA, a child of deaf adults. Her father, John Heron, became deaf in his childhood and her late mother Coralie was deaf from birth.\n\"Growing up it was always my experience to come to this church, I came to the youth club here and it just felt part of my life.\n\"I have had people say to me 'well surely you're not a member of the Kinghan Church because you're not actually deaf' and I say 'no I am very much a member'.\"\nRosie said the church has always had a ethos of being a place for deaf people and their families to worship.\n\"It is a church like any other and it is open to everyone.\"\nJohn said: \"I think why I want to come is because I want to come and be where other deaf people are and chat in sign language.\n\"That's the element that's most important for me.\"\n'Famous'\nNow 91, Rosie says it is as important as ever that her dad knows the church is always there for him.\nBut during the Covid pandemic, John struggled with not being able to come to church and did not enjoy the online services.\n\"He started signing hymns and I would film him and they would have been put on the Kinghan Church Facebook page.\n\"They were shared many many times and he has had 4,000 or 5,000 likes on his Facebook posts and think he is now considered famous in our little world.\"",

The board recognised that action needed to be taken to restructure the current leadership team and it has taken these steps to address this.\n\"Our focus is on the completion of Glen Sannox and hull 802 (Glen Rosa), and the implementation of a robust business plan to improve the commercial viability of Ferguson Marine.\n\"With this new senior management team in place and a full complement of board members, we have the breadth and depth of experience and capability to drive forward these plans.\"\nEconomy Secretary Mairi McAllan said Mr Tydeman's sacking was a matter for the Ferguson board and that she was focusing on getting the ferries finished, driving down costs and securing a \"sustainable future\" for the yard and workers.\nShe said: \"While the yard had previously stated that the delivery date for Glen Sannox was planned for late May, we are aware that, in the last week, the outgoing CEO intimated further delay was likely.\n\"That is unacceptable.

Each could face up to 18 months in jail if convicted.\nMs Durantez also wants the four men to pay damages totalling \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100,000 (\u00c2\u00a385,677; $108,000) to Ms Hermoso, and for Mr Rubiales to pay at least half of this amount.\nShe also requested a restraining order for Mr Rubiales, barring him from coming within 200 metres (656 feet) of Ms Hermoso and from communicating with her for the next seven-and-a-half years.\nThe scandal overshadowed a historic moment for Spain's women's team, which at the time was celebrating its first ever World Cup win.\nDuring the trophy presentation ceremony, Mr Rubiales clasped Ms Hermoso's head between his hands and planted a kiss on her lips.\nHe was also criticised for grabbing his crotch when celebrating the win, while standing next to Spain's Queen Letizia and her daughter Princess Infanta Sofia.\nThe incident set off a wave of global anger at sexism at the highest levels of women's sport and led to boycotts of the national team by Spain's players as they called for changes to be made to women's football in the country.\nMr Rubiales was initially suspended by world football's governing body, Fifa, before he eventually stood down as both head of Spain's football federation and vice-president of the Union of European Football Associations (Uefa) in September.\nIn January, Fifa upheld a three-year ban from footballing activities for Mr Rubiales after he lodged an appeal.\nMr Vilda - the coach who led the women's team to their World Cup victory and an ally of Mr Rubiales - was also sacked in September amid the fallout from the scandal, but was appointed head coach for Morocco's women's team in October .",
    "The team behind a women's urinal which is designed to reduce time spent in queues are now looking to trial their invention abroad.\nThe flatpack PEEQUAL urinals are designed by Amber Probyn, 25, and Hazel McShane, 26, who say they are six times quicker to use than a regular toilet.\nThe team have now raised \u00c2\u00a3500,000 in investment, which the pair say they are using to improve the product.\nThey are hoping to bring the urinals to Germany and the Netherlands this year.\nThe pair, who graduated from Bristol University in 2020, came up with the idea after spending many summers working at music festivals in the UK.\nThey said they had to choose between going to the toilet or getting food during their breaks and so decided to work on the problem for their masters project.\nTheir invention is designed like a boat to minimise splash back and allows for clothing to come down at the front.\nPEEQUAL currently have around 134 units and the pair say they are now signing several deals with large-scale festival operators, with 20 to 25 events currently secured for this coming season.\nThey say investors have now shown interest in bringing the urinals to festivals in Germany.\n\"We realise this is a shift in behaviour but it's a more efficient way of doing things,\" Ms McShane said.\n\"At the start of the day you might look at this woman's urinal and be like 'I'm not sure about that' - but after a few drinks, and after you've waited in the queue for about 15 minutes already - this option suddenly becomes much more appealing,\" she added.\nAccording to their website, the team are aware of their climate impact.\nIn addition to the units being made out of plastic removed from the ocean, they are in discussions with a company to turn the thousands of litres of urine collected into fertiliser.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "From Monday, any cars the UK exports to Canada will face an additional 6% tariff, or tax.\nThe change comes after a post-Brexit agreement to continue EU trading terms expired without a new deal.\nThe new tariffs are determined by whether the UK products exported to Canada use EU parts and materials.\nLimits, which had been waived, will now apply, meaning that certain exports, including cars, will not qualify for zero-tariff trade.\nIn 2023, 1.3% of British-built cars were exported to Canada, making it the UK's eighth largest market, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which represents the UK car industry.\nThe car industry has expressed its concern, especially as there appears no timetable for a resumption of discussions.\nThe tariff was \"disappointing\", said Mike Hawes from SMMT, adding that manufacturers \"can only do so much\" to mitigate the higher costs for consumers which will result from the tariff.\n\"Given Canada's importance as a market for UK automotive exports, and the detriment this tariff will have on Canadian consumers, we urge all parties to be pragmatic, to resume negotiations on an upgraded trade deal,\" Mr Hawes added.\nThese so-called \"rules of origin\" considerations also matter in the chemicals industry.\nThere is a wider disagreement between the UK and Canada over punitive tariffs on UK exports of cheese and the refusal of the UK to allow imports of Canadian hormone-treated beef. As a result of the disagreement, the trade secretary pulled the plug on wider free trade deal talks with Canada.\nTrade secretary Kemi Badenoch met her Canadian counterpart at a trade summit in February, and officials continued discussions recently without a breakthrough. A UK government source said it was a shame that Canada could not see that \"now, more than ever\" it was vital for allies to work together.\n\"Sadly, Canada has shown no willingness to agree an extension,\" they said. \"There's only so long you can bang your head against a brick wall when the other side isn't willing to find solutions.\" Canadian farmers have lobbied the government in Ottawa to veto the ratification of the UK's membership of the trans-Pacific trade deal, the CPTPP. But Canada does appear to be pushing ahead with UK accession. However, with both the UK and Canada in the run-up to elections, it could be some time before the spat is settled.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"Canada's decision not to roll over these rules of origin will increase the cost of trade and hurt businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\"The UK Government remains ready to work with Canada to find a solution that works for both countries, but we won't accept rowing back on the current terms\".",

    "People in Senegal have been voting for a new president in a delayed election after weeks of political unrest.\nLong queues of voters were witnessed across the country as they flocked to choose from 17 presidential candidates.\nAfter he voted, outgoing President Macky Sall warned candidates against making premature claims of victory.\nThe election had been due to take place last month but Mr Sall postponed it, triggering deadly opposition protests and a democratic crisis.\nSeven million people were eligible to vote in the mainly Muslim West African nation, which had until then been praised as a bastion of democracy in the region.\nPolling stations are now closing after a largely calm day of voting as most people are returning home to prepare to break their fast, which happens at sunset during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.\nAmong those in the running for Senegal's top job is the governing BBY coalition's candidate, former Prime Minister Amadou Ba, 62. After casting his ballot in the capital, Dakar, he said he was \"very confident\" of a first-round election victory.\nHis main challenger, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, expressed similar confidence after voting, along with his two wives, in his hometown of Ndiaganiao, which is about 100km (62 miles) from Dakar.\nThe 44-year-old was released from jail just 10 days ago, after being detained since April 2023 on charges of insurrection, which he said were politically motivated.\nHis ally, opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, was also freed from prison following an amnesty intended to calm tensions. He voted in his southern stronghold of Ziguinchor, saying they expected a \"dazzling victory\".\nPopular with young people, he is not allowed to stand because of a series of charges he says are trumped up. He and his now-disbanded Pastef party are backing Mr Faye.\nA 25-year-old voter in Ndiaganiao, who only gave her first name, Mbissine, told the BBC: \"This election is the election of the youth. If I had one [piece of] advice for other young people, it would be to come and vote. That's the only way we can help ourselves.\"\nAt the same polling station, 84-year-old Di\u00c3\u00a9gane Gueye, who walked with the assistance of a cane, said: \"I came to vote because today is an important day for our nation. There is a lot at stake and that's why we should care.\"\nThere have been complaints from a polling centre in the town of Keur Massar, about 20km north-east of Dakar, because some people were not been able to vote as they had old ID cards, even though their names were on the voters' roll. The new cards note that Keur Massa is now its own voting district and not part of Pikine as it was until 2021.\nA BBC team in Keur Massar says the military police have been deployed as tension has risen outside the polling station at a school in the town. The electoral commission has now said it will try to resolve the situation.\nOn Friday, former President Abdoulaye Wade and his PDS party threw their support behind Mr Faye, after his own son, Karim Wade, was forced to withdraw over his dual French-Senegalese citizenship.\nFor the first time in more than a decade, a female candidate is in the race. Anta Babacar Ngom, 40, leads the ARC party.\nResults are expected within days and a second round is likely, because of the large number of contestants. A candidate needs more than 50% of the vote to be declared the winner.\nThe world will be watching to see if the election process goes some way to restoring Senegal's now-bruised reputation.\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier this week, President Sall said that he had \"no apology to make\" for postponing the election, which was originally due to be held on 25 February.\n\"I have done nothing wrong,\" he said, adding that the decision to delay the vote was not taken unilaterally, but was because of electoral concerns raised by members of parliament.\n\"All the actions that have been taken have been within the framework of the law and regulations.\"\nMore on Senegal's 2024 election:",
    "Council spending on school transport for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) has almost doubled in the last five years, BBC research has found.\nSpending is set to hit \u00c2\u00a31.4bn across local authorities in England in 2023-24, a 95% rise from \u00c2\u00a3728m in 2018-19.\nCouncils are required by law to provide free transport to SEND children who are unable to walk to school.\nThe government said it was investing \u00c2\u00a32.6bn in special school places.\nIt said this would mean fewer children would need to travel long distances, reducing costs.\nCouncil leaders say while inflation has pushed up costs, the rise has been fuelled by increased demand and complex cases.\nLocal authorities have seen demand increase by over 40%, with more than 183,000 children using the services this year.\nMeanwhile, the average annual cost of SEND school transport per child across England has gone up by around a third, from \u00c2\u00a36,280 to \u00c2\u00a38,299.\nThe rising cost of providing school transport is a key driver of the current pressure on council budgets.\nCouncil leaders have warned overspends in this area will lead to cuts in services elsewhere as they try to balance the books and avoid following other councils who have recently gone bust.\nThe leader of the County Councils Network, Tim Oliver, said the cost of school transport was \"unsustainable\" and suggested means-testing should be looked at, meaning some parents might have to pay.\nIn Surrey, 11-year-old Shakeerah relies on a taxi that is paid for by the council to get her to and from school every day.\nShe was diagnosed with a brain tumour just after her first birthday, and requires constant care.\nShe is deaf and attends a mainstream school, which uses and teaches British Sign Language and is an hour's drive from her home.\nHer mum, Yasmeen Crowther, said the transport the council provides is essential. She and her husband work full time, and could not do the two-hour round-trip twice a day.\n\"If Shakeerah didn't have the transport, she wouldn't go to school,\" she said. \"She's of statutory school age, she's entitled to an education.\"\nBBC research shows the councils with some of the longest journeys are Herefordshire at 242 miles, which the council said was a weekly trip, and East Sussex at 220 miles.\nOne council, Buckinghamshire, said it was paying \u00c2\u00a3952 per day for \"two complex medical passengers\" to travel by ambulance with a nurse.\nOther examples include a \u00c2\u00a3684 per day trip in Trafford and \u00c2\u00a3650 for a trip three times a week for a child in Lincolnshire.\nMr Oliver, who is also the Conservative leader of Surrey County Council, said his own local authority's budget for home-to-school transport was overspent by \u00c2\u00a310m.\n\"Nobody could argue this system is working as it should do,\" he said. \"But throwing money at - even if that money was available - isn't actually the answer.\"\nHe said a \"grown-up conversation\" needs to happen and suggested that some parents might be willing to pay.\n\"It won't be popular of course because it's another cost and that's a challenge, but I think we do need to have that conversation.\"\nEarlier this year three Warwickshire councillors apologised after claiming that some children with a diagnosis that qualifies for support were just badly behaved and that parents had been swapping diagnosis tips on social media.\nBut Mr Oliver does not believe that parents should be having the finger pointed at them.\n\"We all want the best for our children and that is all that these parents are seeking to do,\" he said.\n\"I think the system can be quite adversarial... but every parent is simply trying to do the best for their child, I don't think people are making these things up.\"\nYasmeen said it has been a constant fight to get Shakeerah the support she needs.\n\"It's been very hard to try and navigate what she's entitled to, but also what the local authority can provide as well - there's a huge disparity between the two,\" she said.\n\"Children with SEND are always the ones who see those cuts first, and it has a massive impact on the family unit.\"\nBBC News sent Freedom of Information requests to all 151 councils in England with statutory responsibilities to provide school transport for SEND children.\nA total of 147 of those came back with responses on spending and 113 came back with responses on demand.\nThese responses have been supplemented by public data included in council submissions to central government and by analysis carried out by the County Councils Network.\nDue to variations in the way local authorities gather data, some councils may only have provided information relating to under-16 SEND transport.\nLabour said the whole SEND system was \"on its knees\", with a lack of local provision due to cuts to council finances.\nLouise Gittins, the Labour leader of Cheshire West and Chester Council and chairwoman of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People's board, said: \"What's fundamentally at the bottom of that is that children shouldn't have to be travelling 50 mile",

    "A draft report uncovered by the BBC shows the Post Office spent \u00c2\u00a3100m fighting sub-postmasters in court despite knowing its defence was untrue.\nThe document reveals the Post Office was shown evidence by 2017 that losses could be due to errors in the Horizon IT system or remote tampering.\nBut it kept arguing in the Bates v Post Office Ltd case that theft or mistakes by sub-postmasters must be to blame.\nThe Post Office said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment.\nPatrick Green KC, the lead barrister for the sub-postmasters in the Bates case, said the BBC's findings were \"absolutely shocking\". After reading the report, he added: \"I don't think the case should have happened.\"\nBetween 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted because of faults with Horizon, which was developed by the Japanese IT company Fujitsu.\nThe landmark Bates v Post Office High Court case - portrayed in a recent ITV drama - ran from 2018 to 2019 and was brought by 555 sub-postmasters. They argued that the real cause of their missing cash was not theft but flaws with Horizon or failed attempts by Fujitsu to correct system errors remotely.\nThe total cost to the Post Office in the legal action was \u00c2\u00a3100m of public money.\nThe draft report, titled Bramble, was commissioned by the Post Office in March 2016 and carried out by consultants Deloitte.\nThroughout the draft report, Deloitte refers to having already discussed its findings with \"Post Office management\" and even the fact that some of these were shared with the Post Office's investigators for further analysis.\nTim Parker, the Post Office's chairman at the time of the draft report, also told the BBC via his legal representative that Post Office lawyers liaised with Deloitte about Project Bramble and were responsible for handling, distributing and disclosing it. He added that the Post Office's lawyers were also involved in the \"strategy and day to day management of the litigation\".\nThis raises questions as to whether Post Office lawyers met their responsibilities to not mislead the court.\nFujitsu whistleblower Richard Roll had previously revealed the company could remotely alter sub-postmaster's cash accounts.\nBut Bramble is the first documentary evidence that the Post Office knew Fujitsu staff did this without a sub-postmaster's knowledge - including examples of how often some accounts had been changed.\nThe draft report also warned that a \"malicious actor\" at Fujitsu could change, add or delete transactions without leaving a trace.\nIn July 2017, the Post Office filed a defence document as part of the case. It included some findings from Bramble - in some cases word-for-word - while omitting where they came from and other key elements from the draft report.\nDespite what is set out in Bramble, this defence document - which is accompanied by a signed statement of truth - stated that it would be \"impossible\" for Fujitsu to remotely cause \"significant shortfalls\".\nIn the defence, the Post Office conceded that a \"small number\" of Fujitsu employees had user rights to alter transactions but stated users were strictly controlled.\nBut in Bramble, Deloitte said it was \"impossible\" to know which Fujitsu staff had this unrestricted access prior to 2015 because there were no records of who they were or what they did.\nMr Green, who acted for the sub-postmasters, said that in his 34 years as a barrister, he had never seen a defendant proceeding with a huge case and \"fighting it very aggressively\" in circumstances like this.\nAlthough Bramble specifically looked into the sub-postmasters' claims, the draft report's existence was not disclosed to them or to the court.\nBramble was \"exactly the sort of thing that we would have wanted to have and to analyse and put in front of the judge\", Mr Green said.\nHe added: \"It's them admitting that they could do in 2017 something they were still denying that they could do in 2019.\"\nThe branches examined in Bramble by Deloitte belonged to 91 sub-postmasters involved in the Bates case - including people who had been jailed for theft because of shortfalls.\nJoan Bailey and her husband ran a village Post Office in Powys - their branch is mentioned in the draft report. Mrs Bailey estimates that the couple paid over \u00c2\u00a340,000 to the Post Office to cover losses caused by Horizon.\nWhen the BBC showed Mrs Bailey the report, she said she was \"very angry\". She added: \"This document should have been disclosed years ago.  It would have saved myself - and also a lot of other people - a lot of grief and heartache.\"\nFollowing a request by the BBC, Deloitte's Bramble draft report is now publicly available on the Post Office inquiry website.\nIn June 2016, Tim Parker, the Post Office's then-chairman, told government ministers he had stopped an investigation into Horizon on legal advice, because of the upcoming court action by postmasters. The existence of that letter from the former chairman was revealed by the BBC last month .\nIn it, he said the Post Office would \"i",

It boasts more than 70 million users and brought in $800m in revenue last year.\nKristi Marvin, chief executive of SPACInsider, compared Trump Media - which trades under the ticker DJT for Mr Trump's initials - to a meme stock, in which prices are untethered from the business prospects.\nInterest in Trump Media has also been fuelled by individual investors, as opposed to Wall Street firms, many of them apparently Trump supporters.\n\"Everybody expected to trade a little bit crazy today, which it has,\" she said. \"The real question is how does it trade a week from now, two weeks from now and nobody really knows.\"\nThe deal to list Trump Media was first announced in 2021.\nThe move was accomplished via what is known as a SPAC, a merger with a publicly listed shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corp, which was expressly created to buy a company and take it public.\nThe deal was delayed by government investigations and other hurdles, but regulators cleared it earlier this year and Digital World shareholders voted in favour last week.\nAhead of the listing on the Nasdaq exchange, Trump Media officials called it a \"pivotal moment\" for the firm - and the wider media landscape.\n\"As a public company, we will passionately pursue our vision to build a movement to reclaim the Internet from Big Tech censors,\" said Trump Media chief executive Devin Nunes, a former congressman.\n\"We will continue to fulfil our commitment to Americans to serve as a safe harbour for free expression and to stand up to the ever-growing army of speech suppressors.\"\nThe debut comes at a critical moment for Mr Trump, who has been scrambling for cash to pay legal penalties and owns more than half of the firm's shares.\nHe is currently barred from selling his holdings for at least six months, making it difficult for him to tap the windfall immediately.\nThe company's board, which is stocked with allies including one of his sons, could potentially change that rule, but analysts have said they think that would be unlikely to happen immediately.\nIf Mr Trump were to sell a significant chunk of his shares, it could hurt the share price.\nInvestors face other risks as well, tied to Mr Trump's political fortunes and his 2024 presidential campaign.\nA loss might be expected to hurt the share price, but a win could have the opposite effect, especially if it generated further demand from buyers hoping to curry favour with Mr Trump, said Michael Ohlrogge, a law professor at New York University.\nHowever, Prof Ohlrogge said the current share price is \"far, far elevated above what anyone would consider its fundamental value\".",
    "Two ministers have quit their government roles forcing Rishi Sunak to reshuffle his team.\nRobert Halfon announced he was resigning as an education minister, while James Heappey followed through on a previous promise to step down as armed forces minister.\nBoth MPs are standing down at the next general election.\nIn their place, Leo Docherty will become armed forces minister and Luke Hall education minister.\nMr Heappey, who has represented Wells in Somerset since 2015, announced his intention to quit as an MP and stand down as a minister earlier this month.\nMr Halfon, who as a minister had responsibility for apprenticeships and skills, has been Tory MP for Harlow since 2010.\nBoth MPs have written resignation letters so loyal to Mr Sunak they could have been penned by Number 10.\nEach will have their own personal reasons for their decision.\nIt is certainly not a bombshell blow to the PM - but the resignations are part of a trend. Of the 98 MPs who have announced they will not stand at the next election, most are Conservatives.\nSome, like Theresa May and Dominic Raab, are veterans. Others, like Dehenna Davison and Nicola Richards, relatively young and new to the Commons.\nAll of them want to do something else with their lives.\nBut every Conservative can also read the opinion polls which currently suggest the Tory party could soon be in opposition.\nBefore the 2010 election, 150 MPs announced they would stand down, mainly from the Labour party.\nIn power for 13 years, Labour MPs knew their days in office could be numbered.\nWhat is starting to look like a voluntary exodus of Tory MPs from the Commons may only accelerate as polling day gets closer.\nIn other changes to government roles, following the two resignations:\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Halfon said he believed there was \"quiet admiration\" for Mr Sunak across the country.\nHe also quoted from one of his favourite novels, J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, in his resignation thread, saying he believed the words \"perfectly capture my feelings as I move onto my next journey in life\".\n\"I am with you at present\u00e2\u0080\u00a6but soon I shall not be. I am not coming to the Shire\u00e2\u0080\u00a6My time is over: it is no longer my task to set things to rights, nor to help folk to do so. And as for you, my dear friends, you will need no help\u00e2\u0080\u00a6among the great you are, and I have no longer any fear at all for any of you,\" wrote the MP, quoting fictional wizard Gandalf.\nHe served as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party when David Cameron was prime minister and is a former chairman of the education select committee.\nMr Sunak praised his work promoting apprenticeships in his reply to his resignation letter.\nMr Heappey also assured Mr Sunak of his \"full commitment\" until the end of this Parliament.\nThe prime minister has said his \"working assumption is there will be a general election in the second half of this year.\nIn a thread posted on X, Mr Heappey said he had \"loved every minute\" in \"this incredible department\".\nBut behind the scenes the former soldier was unhappy at the level of military spending and issued a departing plea this week for the defence spending target of 2.5% of GDP to be \"achieved urgently\".\nHe is also believed to be nursing wounds from last year's reshuffle, when he was overlooked for the defence secretary role in favour of Grant Shapps, who has no military experience.\nMr Heappey and Mr Halfon join a growing exodus of Tory MPs from the Commons, currently tallying 63, as the Tories languish in the polls ahead of the national vote expected later this year.\nThe number of MPs standing down is broadly in line with the 90 who quit in 2015, while 149 quit before the 2010 election that followed the expenses scandal and saw Labour ejected from power after 13 years.\nNumber of MPs standing down so far:\nTotal: 98\nConservative: 63\nLabour: 16\nSNP: 9\nPlaid Cymru: 1\nGreen: 1\nSinn Fein: 2\nIndependent: 6 (Matt Hancock, Julian Knight, Crispin Blunt, Bob Stewart formerly Conservatives; Conor McGinn, Nick Brown formerly Labour).",

    "Oscar-winning British actress Olivia Colman has said she would be paid \"a lot more\" for her films if she was a man.\n\"I'm very aware that if I was Oliver Colman, I'd be earning a... lot more than I am,\" she told CNN.\n\"I know of one pay disparity which was a 12,000% difference. Do the maths.\"\nThe issue of equal pay in Hollywood burst into the open a decade ago, but the latest top 10 list of the best-paid actors contains just two women.\nSpeaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Colman said: \"Research suggests that they [women] have always been big box office draws.\n\"Don't get me started on the pay disparity, but male actors get paid more because they [executives] used to say they [male actors] draw in the audiences. And actually that hasn't been true for decades.\n\"But they still like to use that as a reason to not pay women as much as their male counterparts, particularly in our industry.\"\nColman joined the Hollywood A-list in 2019 when she won the best actress Oscar for playing Queen Anne in The Favourite, and has since had two more nominations.\nShe recently appeared in the Wonka film and will feature in the forthcoming Paddington In Peru.\nHer TV credits include Heartstopper and Secret Invasion, and she played Queen Elizabeth II in series three and four of Netflix's The Crown.\nThere was an outcry when it was revealed that Colman's predecessor as the monarch, Claire Foy, was paid less than her on-screen Duke of Edinburgh, Matt Smith . At the time, producers promised that would not be the case for Colman and co-star Tobias Menzies.\nEqual pay in Hollywood was put into the spotlight after a hack in 2014 of emails from Sony executives, which revealed, among other things, that Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams were paid less than their male co-stars for American Hustle.\n'Spoiled'\nLawrence later wrote that she didn't want to push for more during negotiations because she \"didn't want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled'\".\n\"At the time, that seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the internet and realised every man I was working with definitely didn't worry about being 'difficult' or 'spoiled'.\"\nThe treatment of women in Hollywood continued to be in the spotlight as the #MeToo movement took off.\nWhen Kevin Spacey was dropped from the film All the Money in the World following allegations against him, another scandal was sparked when it was revealed that actor Mark Wahlberg was paid $1.5m to do reshoots while co-star Michelle Williams received just $80 a day in expenses.\nColman's comments suggest the gender pay gap is an ongoing issue.\nThis February, research said only 30 of the 100 top-grossing movies of 2023 featured women or girls in lead roles - down from 44 the previous year, and the lowest for almost a decade.\nAnd when Forbes magazine published its latest annual list of the highest-earing actors earlier this month, Margot Robbie and Jennifer Aniston were the only women in the top 10.",

He said: \"Everybody gets older and less able in time, so we should design all houses to be really accessible.\n\"[This is] a really beautiful house but it doesn't look like an accessible home so it doesn't have to be a compromise.\"\nThe winners of the Royal Institute of British Architects regional awards will be announced this spring.\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Despite attempts by President Vladimir Putin and Russia's state-controlled media to pin the blame for Friday's deadly Moscow theatre attack on Ukraine, more details are emerging about the jihadist group IS-K, believed to have been behind it.\nWho or what is IS-K?\nIS-K is an abbreviation of Islamic State-Khorasan - a regional affiliate of the Islamic State group, which has been proscribed as a terror organisation by governments across the world.\nIt is focused on Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan and into Central Asia.\nThe group has given itself the name Khorasan as that was part of an historic Islamic caliphate spanning that region.\nIS-K has been around for nine years but in recent months it has emerged as the most dangerous branch of the Islamic State group, with a long reach and a reputation for extreme brutality and cruelty.\nAlong with what is left of the group's wider leadership in Syria and Iraq, IS-K aspires to a pan-national Islamic caliphate ruled through an ultra-strict interpretation of Sharia, Islamic law.\nIn Afghanistan it is waging a sporadic but still deadly insurgency against the country's rulers, the Taliban, who it opposes on ideological grounds.\nHas IS-K carried out attacks before?\nIt targeted the chaotic evacuation from Kabul airport in 2021 with a suicide bomb , killing 170 Afghans and 13 US servicemen.\nThe following year it targeted the Russian embassy in Kabul , killing at least six people and injuring others.\nThe group has carried out indiscriminate attacks on a maternity ward, bus stations and policemen.\nIn January this year, IS-K carried out a double bombing of a shrine in Kerman , Iran, killing nearly 100 Iranians.\nIn Russia it has carried out numerous small-scale attacks, the most recent being in 2020 - and already this year the FSB, Russia's internal security service, says it has stopped several terror plots.\nWho were the Moscow attackers?\nAccording to Russian state media at least three of the men are Tajiks from the Central Asian republic of Tajikistan, which used to be part of the Soviet Union.\nIt is obvious from their battered and bruised appearance in court that they have been especially harshly interrogated to the point of torture.\nThe problem with that is according to international norms, their confessions will be worthless - people will say anything to make the pain stop, including confessing to a narrative that is simply untrue.\nReports have emerged that one of the men was seen carrying out surveillance of the venue in early March, around the time the US warned Russia there was an imminent threat of a terrorist attack on a public space - a warning the Kremlin dismissed at the time as \"propaganda\".\nAnother report says at least two of the attackers arrived in Russia recently, implying that this was a \"hit team\" sent by IS-K, rather than a sleeper cell of residents.\nWhy did they target Russia?\nThere are several reasons.\nIS-K consider most of the world to be their enemies. Russia is high up on their list, along with the US, Europe, Israel, Jews, Christians, Shia Muslims, the Taliban and all rulers of Muslim-majority states, who they consider to be \"apostates\".\nIslamic State's hostility to Russia goes back to the Chechen wars in the 1990s and early 2000s, when Moscow's forces devastated the Chechen capital Grozny.\nMore recently, Russia entered the Syrian civil war on the side of its ally, President Bashar al-Assad, and the Russian air force has carried out countless bombings of rebel and civilian positions, killing large numbers of Islamic State group and Al-Qaeda-linked fighters.\nIn Afghanistan, IS-K view Russia as being an ally of the Taliban, which is why they attacked the Russian embassy in Kabul in 2022.\nThey also bear a grudge for the 10 years of brutal Soviet occupation of that country from 1979-89.\nThen there is the situation inside Russia itself.\nRussia is viewed by IS-K as very much a Christian country and their video posted after the Moscow attack talks about killing Christians.\nTajik and other Central Asian migrant workers are sometimes subject to a degree of harassment and suspicion by the FSB as it seeks to head off terrorist attacks.\nFinally, Russia - a nation currently distracted by its full-scale war with its neighbour Ukraine - may simply have been a convenient target of opportunity for IS-K, a place where weapons were available and their enemy's guard was down.\nWhat do we still not know about the Moscow attack?\nThere remain a number of unanswered questions about this whole episode.\nFor example, why were the attackers able to wander at will around the Crocus Hall with absolutely no apparent sense of urgency?\nIn a country where the police and special services, notably the FSB, are omnipresent, these gunmen behaved as if they knew they were not going to be interrupted by a police SWAT team.\nThen there are the weapons - not just handguns but powerful, modern automatic assault rifles. How were they able to acquire these and smuggle them undetected into the venue?\nThei",
    "When India's Tata Group bought the country's national airline, it was welcomed as something of a miracle.\nAir India had been mired in debt and under-funded state management for decades. No-one wanted even a piece of the iconic but loss-making carrier.\nBut a deal was struck in 2021, just as the world was emerging from the pandemic - and airlines were betting big on revenge travel once borders reopened.\nThey were right. The rebound is well and truly under way and air travel is off to a roaring start in 2024. There have been warnings of slower growth in the US, where spending is expected to plateau after a post-pandemic spike. But it is a different story on the other side of the world in Asia.\n\"If we look at the size of the opportunity in India, it's already the world's most populous country,\" Air India's chief executive Campbell Wilson told the BBC at a recent aviation event in Singapore. \"It has the geographic advantage... connecting regions of the world together. And it is a hugely underserved market.\"\nBy 2042, India's domestic aviation market is expected to be five times the size it was in 2019, with Indians taking around 685 million trips every year, according to plane maker Airbus . That would make the South Asian nation one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and third after China and the United States.\nIt is not just India. By the middle of the century, Indonesia, which now ranks 13th globally in passenger numbers, is predicted to jump to the fourth spot, analysts say. Air travel is also expected to boom in the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam in the coming decades.\nThey are all emerging economies with young, growing populations that can afford to spend on travel. And it is showing: global air traffic jumped by 16% over the last year. But in Asia, the increase was almost twice as much, according to industry figures.\nGovernments in these places are also investing in infrastructure to improve connectivity, which is essential in vast archipelagos like Indonesia and the Philippines.\nChina, of course, is an obvious market - despite its currently sluggish economy, its travellers have emerged from zero-Covid rules to return to holidaying. Beijing is now offering visa-free travel to citizens of certain countries and some nations, like Thailand and Singapore, are reciprocating.\n\"We are pleased that people are beginning to travel out of China. It is probably one of the last countries to come back big in travel,\" says Glenn Fogel, chief executive of online travel agency Booking.com.\nBut airlines are looking for alternative markets because of China's slowing economy, the uncertainty of doing business there and a fall in consumer spending.\nEnter the Philippines.\n\"Asia is a very exciting place to be - the Philippines is one of the most exciting places to be. Great opportunity there,\" says Michael Szucs, chief executive of the Philippine budget carrier Cebu Pacific.\nThe airline struggled through the pandemic without government support. And like many competitors around the world, it is also facing groundings over faulty Pratt & Whitney engines.\nBut it has seen a revival in the last two years, expanding and cornering more than half of its domestic market. A new Philippine government is also helping - it is privatising the international airport in Manila and plans to add runways throughout the archipelago to receive larger and more aircraft.\nMr Szucs has high hopes for the country of around 115 million people, where per capita spending is rising: \"We've got an increasingly educated population that is relatively young, it's growing, with an increasing propensity to travel.\"\nIndia, on the other hand, is a trickier market to conquer. Air India faces a stiff domestic rival in Indigo, and a daunting challenge in matching Emirates and Qatar Airways, which regularly rank among the world's best airlines.\nBut the successful salt-to-software conglomerate Tata has started to turn the ailing carrier around. The company has already spent millions of dollars investing in new planes, new branding and restructuring old and inefficient systems.\nNow it wants to consolidate its five airlines - three Air India subsidiaries, and two joint ventures, Air Asia India and Vistara (with Singapore Airlines). The goal: a highly regarded airline for international flyers, and a reliable low-cost option for domestic passengers.\nMr Wilson hopes to restore Air India's glory - it was India's first airline, started by the Tatas in the 1930s and rebranded as Air India and nationalised in the 1950s. He believes winning the international market is key but will need \"connecting more cities around the world nonstop with India\" - and that will involve starting more routes and, of course, buying more aircraft.\nThe company has already gone on a buying spree. It ordered more than 200 Boeing Max 8 and Max 10s in one of the largest airline deals in aviation history . But the Max family of planes is under scrutiny since a door plug blew off a 737 ",
    "Part of a \"open access\" green space is to be fenced off to protect local schoolchildren, planners confirmed.\nPeterborough City Council said about third of Werrington Fields would have new barriers, despite objections from some local people that too much land would become unavailable to them.\nIt is already designated as educational land and used by pupils at Ken Stimpson Academy.\nThe council said some of the land would still be available to the public.\nThe decision followed a meeting of the authority and the Four Cs Multi Academy Trust - which runs the school.\nIt came after the Education Secretary, Gillian Keegan, confirmed the decision over the future of the land rested with the council .\n'Frustration'\nCouncil leader Mohammed Farooq, from the Peterborough First group, said the council had \"taken a lot of time to understand the legacy of decision making\" going back to 2019 when discussions started.\n\"We understand the frustration from some members of the local community who currently use this area, whilst at the same time fully appreciate the needs of the school.\n\"Our overriding concern must be the safety of children and for this reason the council supports the decision of the academy trust.\"\nHe said the academy would now have to submit a planning application to change the permitted use of the field from educational land with open access to educational land with restricted public use, which would include a Community Use Agreement \"as the academy has always supported the best use of the fields outside of school hours\".\nMike Sandeman, chief executive of Four Cs, said they needed to \"offer a curriculum that stretches and challenges all young people... some of that learning also needs to occur outside\".\n\"Being able to offer the essential balance of learning environments requires appropriate risk management,\" he said.\n\"As Ken Stimpson Academy is unable to safeguard the fields, the educational experiences of all students have been severely impacted and narrowed.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "The number of children living in poverty in Northern Ireland showed a significant increase in 2022, official figures suggest.\nThey indicate that about 109,000 children or 24% were living in relative poverty, compared to 19% in 2021.\nMost other poverty indicators worsened, although pensioner poverty continued its long term improvement.\nThe general increase in poverty coincided with the spike in energy prices and other costs.\nThe figures from the Department for Communities use two main measures of living standards: relative poverty and absolute poverty.\nOver the past decade the percentage of children living in relative poverty in Northern Ireland has hovered at about 20%.\nIt reached a high of 25% in 2014 and a low of 18% in 2021.\nThe long term trend shows that children are at a higher risk of living in poverty than the overall Northern Ireland population in both relative and absolute measures.\nThe new figures also suggest that the percentage of pensioners living in absolute poverty fell to just 7% in 2022, down from 12% the year before.\nHow is poverty measured?\nThere are two main measurements of low income used by the government. Income is counted as the money a household has to spend after housing costs are taken into account.\nAn individual is considered to be in relative poverty if they are living in a household with an income below 60% of the typical UK income.\nThis is a measure of whether those in the lowest income households are keeping pace with the growth of incomes in the population as a whole.\nIn 2022 the relative poverty threshold for a couple with no children was an income, from all sources, of \u00c2\u00a3373 per week, before housing costs.\nFor a couple with children the threshold would be higher and for a single person the threshold would be lower at \u00c2\u00a3250.\nAn individual is considered to be in absolute poverty if they are living in a household with an income below 60% of the typical UK income as measured in 2010.\nFigures, produced on the same basis, for the UK as a whole suggest poverty rates in Northern Ireland are better than the UK average.\nThe rate of absolute poverty in the UK in 2022 was 18% while in Northern Ireland it was 14%.\nThe rate of absolute child poverty in the UK was 25% while in Northern Ireland it was 19%.\nIn recent years Northern Ireland has generally had lower rates of poverty than the UK as a whole.\nThat may be because Stormont introduced measures to mitigate the impact of benefit cuts imposed by the Conservative and Liberal Democrats coalition.\nFor example the 'bedroom tax' has effectively been disapplied in Northern Ireland.",
    "\"We had hoped that when people saw how clean the countryside was that they would keep it up. But unfortunately, it's still as bad as ever.\"\nAvril Waller began litter-picking around Carrickfergus in the early days of the Covid pandemic.\nThis was when she spotted \"rubbish everywhere\" on her daily walks.\nFriends joined her and what started as a few people doing their bit has now grown into a hundreds-strong group of volunteers called Eco Rangers NI.\nThey regularly patrol roads around Carrickfergus, Larne and Ballynure, lifting rubbish as they go - almost 4,000 bags last year, each with hundreds of items in them.\n'It's amazing what you find'\nMost of those items - plastic, paper, card, cans and coffee cups - are either recyclable or compostable.\nMuch to Avril's disappointment, it shows no sign of abating.\n\"Two weeks ago we did the A8 with 27 volunteers that picked up 103 bags of rubbish.\n\"And that included 30 two-litre bottles of urine.\"\nWearing hi-vis fluorescent orange protective wear as they work, they have been asked if they are doing some kind of community service penalty, which makes eldest team member Heather Loveday, aged 74, laugh.\n\"It's very therapeutic, and you're doing a good job for all the people who are not doing a good job throwing things out of car windows.\n\"It's amazing what you find - just amazing.\"\nThose finds have changed in the short years since they began.\n\"When this all started, it was all masks, we picked up a lot of blue gloves as well and wet wipes,\" said Avril.\n\"That has changed now, cigarette packets have changed to vapes and now that more people are going back to work it's coffee cups and painkillers.\n\"And on the way back on the other side of the dual carriageway it's more snacks, crisp packets, sweetie wrappers - things like that.\n\"So coming home, maybe they're tired.\"\nThe bright blue bags that they fill are recorded on an app then collected from the roadside by Mid and East Antrim Council.\nIf the Rangers have been able to separate the items, they will be recycled accordingly and could help the group raise funds.\nOtherwise, the bags go to landfill.\nA worrying development is the increasing number of nitrous oxide gas canisters, both small and large, found by the volunteers on the roadside.\nAlso known as laughing gas , it was recategorised as a Class C drug in the UK in 2023.\nNI litter is 'just getting worse'\nApproximately 12 million items of litter are polluting roads across Northern Ireland at any time, according to Stormont-funded statistics.\nBut the majority of items collected by the Eco Rangers NI can be put in recycling bins at home or dropped off at local collection points in the case of things like soft plastics.\nAnd many can be repurposed, like the ring pulls from aluminium cans that Tom Dunne collects for wheelchair and amputee support charities.\n\"I enjoy getting out in the fresh air, but it's terrible how much you collect.\n\"It's just getting worse.\"\nThe Eco Rangers are now taking part in the Big Spring Clean 2024 , with just one wish on Avril's list.\n\"We don't want to have to do this on a frequent basis.\n\"We get excited sometimes when we only fill one bag or two bags instead of ten in a small area.\n\"And if people would just change their behaviour, it would make a big impact on how our country looks.\"",
    "A man who killed a mother of three is being considered for release from his whole-life prison sentence, his victim's family have been told.\nVictor Farrant was told he would never be freed after killing his ex-girlfriend Glenda Hoskins, 43, in Portsmouth.\nBut officials have told Mrs Hoskins' children that Farrant is ill and can no longer receive care in jail.\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it has had no formal release application.\nMrs Hoskins' body was found by her then 15-year-old daughter Katie at their home on the quayside in Portsmouth in February 1996.\nFarrant, a building site labourer, was first jailed for 12 years in 1988 for rape, false imprisonment, grievous bodily harm and unlawful wounding.\nHe was released from his sentence in November 1995, and a month later attacked Ann Fidler, at her home in Eastleigh.\nThe 45-year-old victim was beaten around the head with wine bottles and an iron. She sustained serious head injuries and was found slumped in the kitchen of her home by her husband.\nSix weeks later, Farrant murdered Mrs Hoskins, an accountant, by holding her under water in her bath.\nHe immediately stole Mrs Hoskins' car and took a ferry to Belgium, before spending five months in hiding using the false name Charles Kelly and a lottery agent's identity card issued by Bognor Regis Town Football Club.\nFarrant was eventually recognised by a hostel resident in the south of France, who had seen him on the BBC's Crimewatch UK. As a result, Farrant was brought back to the UK to stand trial for the attempted murder of Mrs Fidler and the murder of Mrs Hoskins.\nThe judge at Winchester Crown Court told Farrant: \"This murder was so terrible, and you are so dangerous, that in your case the sentence of life should mean just that.\"\nIn February this year, Mrs Hoskins' son David was contacted by probation officials, who said that Farrant was being considered for release on health grounds.\nDavid was asked if he wanted an exclusion zone and an order not to contact the Hoskins family to be added to the terms of Farrant's licence.\nMrs Hoskins' other son Iain said: \"The words that the judge said at the trial gave us all the reassurance that we needed to start our lives again. He gave us that reassurance that 'life would mean life'.\n\"For the whole family it felt like we'd closed a chapter and were able to get on and live our lives.\"\nIain said he was \"numb\" when he received the news.\n\"I didn't know how to process that information. The first day I ignored it and only read a bit of it. You just don't want to open that door,\" he said.\n\"The email read as 'this is being done, can we discuss where in the country he will be sent?'.\n\"If he's being let out to die\u00e2\u0080\u00a6it doesn't sound like he's on death's door,\" Iain added.\n\"This guy is a master manipulator. Even if he has a terminal illness, he could live for some time and it petrifies us that this man could now be let loose.\"\nIain's sister Katie had arrived home from school to find her mother missing.\nShe rang her father - who was separated from Glenda - and the pair called the police to the home in Port Solent.\nKatie found her mother's body wrapped in a carpet in the converted loft of the house.\n\"Straight away we put Victor Farrant in the frame,\" she said. \"He's dated my mum and after they broke up he'd shown up.\n\"We knew he'd had a lot of obsessive behaviour. We had such anger that it could happen, anger that we knew him, that he'd been to our house. It's a truly evil person to take someone away in that way.\n\"For my family and I, we don't want him to be out in society, and skipping the end of his punishment. He could still be a really dangerous person. If he can walk and breathe, I think he could go on to do this again.\"\nThe Hoskins family have written to Justice Secretary Alex Chalk and Home Secretary James Cleverly with their concerns about Farrant, who is now in his mid 70s.\nSerious offenders who are freed from jail usually have their release approved by the Parole Board, but a spokesman said it had not been involved in Farrant's case.\nThe MoJ said prisoners were sometimes freed on compassionate grounds in rare and exceptional cases, after a medical and risk assessment.\nThe Hoskins family have been told by the probation service that a formal meeting between justice officials about the risk posed by Farrant is scheduled for early April.\nAn MoJ spokesperson said: \"Glenda Hoskins' murder was a horrific crime and our thoughts remain with her family and friends.\n\"Prisoners are only released on compassionate grounds in exceptional circumstances following strict risk assessments and no formal application has yet been made in this case.\"",

    "On Saturday evening, a vigil was held at Hull Minister for those affected by the major police investigation into the \"care of the deceased\" by Legacy Independent Funeral Directors. For relatives waiting for answers, it was a moment of calm and togetherness; a break from the continuing uncertainty.\nWith pain etched deep into tired faces, relatives of the dead formed a queue inside the minster to light a candle.\nSome took the suggestion of Bishop of Hull, Dr Eleanor Sanderson, to softly whisper the name of their loved one followed by the simple but powerful words, \"I love you\".\n\"Light a candle in memory, in hope, in dignity and in love,\" invited Dr Sanderson, emotion in her voice.\nBillie-Jo Suffill, pushing a pram carrying her five-month-old son Jenson, arrived as the candle-lighting drew to a close.\nWith no words exchanged - or needed - a kindly church steward, noticing them arrive, put an arm around the woman, smiled at her baby son, and guided them to the front of the minster to light their candle.\nMs Suffill previously told the BBC how she used Legacy Independent Funeral Directors for the cremations of her brother and father, who died in 2022 . She said she never received her father Andrew Suffill's ashes.\nDr Sanderson opened the vigil by telling the 100-strong congregation the service was \"one small step in a longer journey\".\n\"There are so many unanswered questions,\" she said. \"But we just wanted to provide a safe and private place for you to come together.\"\nA passage from Song of Songs 8:6-7 was read by the Reverend Canon Dr Dominic Black, the minster's vicar.\n\"Love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave,\" said Dr Sanderson, repeating a line. \"We have come to honour our loved ones. We carry them with us tonight, in our hearts.\"\nBefore the families arrived, the bishop pressed home to the media the importance of the vigil.\n\"We can see ripples all through the community,\" she said. \"Almost all of us know someone connected in some way with the investigation.\n\"There are so many questions that just cannot be answered at the moment, which is naturally causing a lot of uncertainty.\"\nDr Sanderson said she had listened to the first interviews with those families affected.\n\"I saw a lot of love in those interviews. That speaks about the heart of Hull.\"\nDr Sanderson said she had spent the past few weeks praying for families and their deceased relatives \"to be at peace\".\nEach person who attended left with a single flower.\nAllowing her son to clutch the flower, Ms Suffill said: \"I wasn't sure about coming tonight. I'm glad I did. The vigil was heart-breaking but beautiful.\"\nA 46-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman, who were arrested on suspicion of prevention of a lawful and decent burial, fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position, remain on police bail.

    "Simon Harris is set to replace Leo Varadkar, not only as taoiseach but also as the youngest person ever to lead the Republic of Ireland.\nAt 37, he is a year younger than Mr Varadkar was when he took the same job in 2017.\nFor Simon Harris, it has been a rapid rise to the top of Irish politics , but then he did start out very early.\nThe County Wicklow native organised his first political meeting at just 16 years of age.\nHe was also in such a hurry to start his career in politics that he dropped out of college without finishing his degree.\n\"I know, in many ways, my career has been a bit odd,\" Mr Harris told Hot Press magazine in 2022.\n\"I was a county councillor at 22. I was a TD (member of the Irish Parliament) at 24.\n\"I was a junior minister at 27. I was the health minister at 29.\n\"Life came at me a lot faster than I expected it to.\"\nMr Harris was confirmed as Fine Gael leader after he was the only candidate to seek the role - now he is on course to become taoiseach following Mr Varadkar's shock resignation announcement on Wednesday.\nWho is Simon Harris?\nMr Harris was born in 1986 and grew up in the coastal town of Greystones, County Wicklow.\nThe eldest of three children, he is the son of a taxi driver and a special needs assistant.\nHis younger brother Adam is autistic - a fact which Mr Harris said kickstarted his own involvement in politics when he was 16.\n\"I was really frustrated - as that moody, opinionated teenager - with the lack of information around autism,\" he told Hotpress.\n\"I saw the stress and strain my parents went through, and called a public meeting in my hometown.\"\nThe teenager invited autistic people and their families to a gathering in his local parish hall.\nAbout 60 people attended the event, which resulted in the establishment of a new autism support and lobby group.\nAs a schoolboy, Mr Harris attended St David's Holy Faith Secondary School in Greystones before beginning a degree in journalism and French at Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT).\nHowever, the future minister for further and higher education dropped out of college during the penultimate year of his four-year degree course.\nHe deferred his studies to work as a parliamentary assistant to Fine Gael Senator Frances Fitzgerald, but very soon he entered elected politics himself.\nIn 2009 he became a councillor in Wicklow, attracting the highest individual vote of any candidate in the county.\nWhen Fine Gael swept to power in 2011 to lead a new coalition government, Mr Harris won a seat for the party in Wicklow.\nAged 24, he was \"the baby of the House\" as the youngest member of the 31st D\u00c3\u00a1il (Irish parliament).\nHis got his first cabinet role in 2016, taking on the prestigious but difficult role of health minister.\nThe following summer he married his long-term girlfriend, children's cardiac nurse Caoimhe Wade.\nHis brother Adam was best man at the ceremony.\nMr Harris is now father to two children.\nIn 2018, he intervened in the case of a nine-year-old schoolboy who was born in Dublin but was facing deportation to China.\nEric Zhi Ying Xue had never been outside Ireland, but was not entitled to Irish citizenship due to a 2004 law change.\n\"Quite frankly, Eric is Irish,\" Mr Harris told BBC News NI at the time.\n\"This is his home. This is his country. I really hope common sense can prevail.\"\nHe appealed to the Department of Justice and, after a wider campaign led by the boy's school, Eric was granted leave to stay.\nCovid-19 gaffe\nMr Harris had served as health minister for more than three and a half years when he faced his biggest challenge - the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe Republic of Ireland took early precautions, closing all schools and colleges almost a fortnight before the UK enforced its lockdown.\nBut six weeks into the national emergency, Mr Harris made a surprising gaffe regarding the name of the disease.\nSpeaking about the prospect of a future vaccine, he said: \"Remember this is coronavirus Covid-19, that means there have been 18 other coronaviruses and I don't think they have successfully found a vaccine for any.\"\nBut Covid-19 was named by the World Health Organization to reflect the year the disease was discovered , having been first identified in China in late 2019.\nWidely ridiculed on social media for his lack of knowledge, Mr Harris apologised for what he described as an \"awful boo-boo\".\nTwo months later he was replaced as health minister when a new coalition government was formed.\nMr Harris was moved to a newly-created department, becoming minister for further and higher education, research, innovation and science.\n'My most important job'\nHe still holds that job and still lives in Wicklow with his young family.\nIn an opinion piece to mark Father's Day in 2022 he said parenthood was \"the most important job I have, and ever will have\".\n\"For me, fatherhood changed my whole life.

    "Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors of his now-bankrupt firm.\nThe ruling cements the downfall of the former billionaire, who emerged as a high profile champion of crypto before his firm's dramatic collapse in 2022.\nHe was found to have stolen billions from customers ahead of the failure.\nBankman-Fried's legal team will appeal against his conviction.\nA message from his parents shared with the BBC by a representative for Bankman-Fried said: \"We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son.\"\nEarlier, the 32-year-old said in court he knew \"a lot of people\" felt \"really let down\".\n\"I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry about what happened at every stage,\" he said, speaking quietly and clearly ahead of his sentencing.\nFTX was one of the world's largest crypto exchanges before its demise, turning Bankman-Fried into a business celebrity and attracting millions of customers who used the platform to buy and trade cryptocurrency.\nRumours of financial trouble sparked a run on deposits in 2022, precipitating the firm's implosion and exposing Bankman-Fried's crimes.\nHe was convicted by a New York jury last year on charges including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, after a trial that detailed how he had taken more than $8bn (\u00c2\u00a36.3bn) from customers, and used the money to buy property, make political donations and put toward other investments.\nBefore reading the sentence on Thursday, Judge Lewis Kaplan provided a harsh assessment of Bankman-Fried's behaviour, saying he had lied during his testimony at trial when he claimed he was unaware until the last minute that his companies were taking money entrusted to them for safe-keeping by customers and using it for other purposes.\n\"He knew it was wrong. He knew it was criminal. He regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood of getting caught but he's not going to admit a thing,\" the judge said.\nThough Bankman-Fried had made \"protestations of sorrow\" about customer losses, he had uttered \"never a word of remorse for the commission of terrible crimes\", he added.\nWhile 25 years constitutes a serious prison sentence, it is far less than the more than 100 years Bankman-Fried could have received under official government guidelines.\nFederal prosecutors in New York this month told the judge such a long term was not necessary.\nBut they requested at least 40 years, arguing that Bankman-Fried had committed a massive fraud, while showing \"brazen disrespect\" for the law.\nBankman-Fried's team had argued for a lighter sentence of roughly five to 6.5 years.\nThey said that he was a non-violent, first-time offender, and pointed to mental health struggles and argued that customers were poised to recover significant sums under a plan currently working through bankruptcy court.\n\"The victims want their money back and they should get it,\" his lawyer, Marc Mukasey, argued in court on Thursday morning. \"Sentence him to work hard and give it all away.\"\nFormer federal prosecutor Mitchell Epner, now a lawyer at Rottenberg Lipman Rich, said he was \"very surprised\" by the ruling, noting that Bankman-Fried could potentially be released from prison in about 13 years.\nBut Jennifer Taub, a law professor at Western New England University and expert on white-collar crime, said she thought the length of the sentence was appropriate.\n\"It is the right balance between how old he is and what is the purpose of deterrence,\" she said.\nIn his sentencing remarks, Judge Kaplan said what could amount to a life sentence was unnecessary but that Bankman-Fried must receive a punishment sufficient to prevent him from committing future crimes.\n\"There is a risk that this man will be in a position to do something very bad in the future and it's not a trivial risk, not a trivial risk at all,\" he said.\nHe also ordered Bankman-Fried to forfeit $11bn that can be used to compensate victims.\nThe government has already seized some of those assets, such as shares Bankman-Fried owned in Robinhood, the trading app which raised more than $600m when they were sold last year.\nBankman-Fried showed little visible reaction to the ruling.\nBankman-Fried has admitted to mistakes of mismanagement, but maintained that he was acting in good faith.\nIn his comments ahead of the sentencing, he stuck to his story that FTX had the holdings to repay customers at the time of its collapse and said he did not think that reasons behind customer suffering had been \"properly told\".\n\"They've been failed by more people than I can count\" including himself, he said, speaking of the exchange's customers. \"It's been excruciating to watch.\"\nBankman-Fried said he was sorry for disappointing not only customers but also former employees, including top lieutenants Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, formerly close friends who testified against him at trial and whom he praised in his remarks.\n\"They all built something really beautiful, ",

    "New guidance to protect bats that has put a \u00c2\u00a3247m road scheme in doubt could halt similar developments, a councillor said.\nNatural England has issued a new report to protect rare barbastelle bats along the proposed route of the Norwich Western Link Road.\nNorfolk County Council leader Kay Mason Billig said the report threatened to \"block any infrastructure scheme\".\nNatural England said its role was to ensure the environment was \"conserved\".\nMs Mason Billig, a Conservative councillor, warned the new guidance could lead to greater problems for other developers.\n\"We saw this on nutrient neutrality, which was a disaster for the house-building industry and now we see this new advice, which threatens to block any infrastructure scheme in the whole of southern and central England and Wales,\" she said.\nThe council hopes to build a 3.9-mile dual carriageway to link the Broadland Northway to the A47 at Easton - completing the Northern Distributor Road around the north of Norwich.\nTo do this, it needs to get a bat mitigation licence from Natural England.\nThis is because there is a super colony of rare barbastelle bats in woodland in the path of the proposed road.\nOfficers at the council have decided the new guidance means it would be \"virtually impossible\" for them to be granted the licence.\nWithout this, the building work would be illegal.\nBrian Watkins, leader of the Liberal Democrat group, said: \"This is going to have a major impact on councils, not just this one, but around the country in being able to deliver key infrastructure projects.\"\nWhat is nutrient neutrality?\nNatural England rules mean 62 local authorities cannot allow new developments unless builders can prove their projects are \"nutrient neutral\".\nThis means it can prove it will not add extra nutrients to the surrounding water.\nNatural England has placed \" favourable conservation status \" on barbastelle bats, effective from this month.\nThis is the minimum threshold at which it is confident the species is thriving in England and is expected to continue to thrive sustainably in the future.\nJames Marshall, Natural England area manager, said there had been no change in the process they use to assess licence applications and its aim was always to ensure the countryside was \"conserved, enhanced and managed for the benefit of people and wildlife\".\n\"Norfolk County Council will need to demonstrate there is no satisfactory alternative to the scheme and that the conservation status of the bats would not be negatively affected by the road,\" he said.\nJamie Osborn from the Green group at County Hall said it was \"fantastic news for the beautiful and unique Wensum Valley\" and called on the Tories to \"apologise\".\nDr Charlotte Packman is an expert on bats from Wild Wings Ecology which is based at the University of East Anglia in Norwich.\n\"This issue was flagged up many times to the council; they've ploughed on regardless with their plans,\" she said.\nSteve Morphew, leader of the Labour group, said: \"We're not surprised; what we know is they've wasted a lot of time and money on this and it's time they ditched it.\"\nClare Morton, chairperson of Weston Longville Parish Council, said the majority of residents, who live near the route of the proposed road, were in favour of it to ease rat-running and congestion through their village.\n\"We don't see anything on the horizon other than the new western link that will relieve this,\" she said.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .

    "Think back to the 2019 election campaign. Quite reasonably, you may not remember every detail of the Conservatives' manifesto - but perhaps you do recall one promise: to reduce immigration.\nThink back further, to 2016 and the Brexit referendum. Then there was a promise to \"take back control\" of the UK immigration system. And since it left the EU in 2020, the UK does have more control.\nBut the numbers of people who've moved here didn't go down, they went up.\nSince the Brexit vote and the Conservatives' victory in 2019, the 12 months to June 2022 saw the fastest population growth since the 1960s. Current projections from the Office for National Statistics put the UK on course for 74 million people by 2036 - six million more than there are today.\nYou'd be well within your rights to ask how that could be? The answer, according to the ONS, is largely immigration.\nAnd one aspect of immigration has received huge amounts of attention from the government and the media. Statement after statement, story after story, has focused on migrants crossing the Channel in small boats - and the government's efforts to stop them.\nIndeed you'd be forgiven for thinking small boats are a major part of why immigration is up. But they aren't.\nNo doubt, small boats are an important issue - on a human and national level. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made \"stopping the boats\" one of his five priorities.\nHis government's flagship Rwanda plan aims to send some asylum seekers who arrive on small boats there - and Mr Sunak is still trying to get the bill through parliament.\nBut it's not small boats that are driving an increase in immigration - it's choices made by the government.\nThere are a number of ways to measure immigration.\nLet's start with one: net migration. That's the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving the UK each year.\nIn 2022, it's estimated to have reached an all-time record of 745,000.\nThen, there's the number of visas issued to people relocating to the UK.  Last year there were more than 1.4 million.\nFor context, last year almost 30,000 people arrived by small boat.\nAfter the UK left the European Union, the government launched a new visa scheme for most people who don't have a UK passport.\nThe government decides the criteria for the different visas it issues - these can be for studying, for working, for humanitarian reasons - and other purposes too.\nIn the words of Prof Brian Bell, who chairs the government's independent Migration Advisory Committee, the rise in immigration is \"the inevitable consequence of government policy\".\nWe can see how this is the case by breaking down that 1.4 million figure.\nIn 2022, the government issued almost 300,000 humanitarian visas. But last year the number was 102,000 - that's just 7% of the 1.4 million visas issued.\nThe government has been consistent in its response when asked about the record levels of net migration.\nTom Pursglove MP, the Legal Migration Minister, told me: \"We've seen incredible generosity in our country to people from Ukraine, people from Afghanistan, people from Syria, and other conflict zones. That is an important part of why we've seen the figures as they are.\"\nIt is important, no doubt. And there was political consensus that issuing visas to people from Hong Kong, Ukraine and elsewhere was the right thing to do.\nBut the numbers show that this isn't the full story.\nThe government has made other choices that have pushed up immigration.\nBrexit and the pandemic added to existing recruitment problems in the social care sector. Care home owners responded by asking the government to make it easier to employ overseas care workers.\nThose calls were echoed by the Migration Advisory Committee, which also suggested the government should fund higher wages to attract more British workers into the sector.\nThe Westminster government agreed more visas could be issued but did not raise wages.\nA number of consequences followed.\nFor care home owners like Raj Sehgal, the changes helped. He filled almost all vacancies in his five Norfolk care homes, with 40% of staff coming from abroad.\n\"If we didn't have international recruitment, I think we would probably be closed by now,\" he told me.\nMore overseas staff arrived to work across the sector. But more may be needed. Last year, there were around 150,000 vacancies in England, and recruiting British workers remains difficult.\nLet's look at that 1.4 million figure again. Of all of those visas, more than 146,000 went to health and social care workers, another 203,000 went to their dependants.\nThis month, the government stopped overseas care workers from bringing dependants, describing the numbers as \"disproportionate\" . Mr Sehgal says this has already reduced the number of applications he is receiving.\nThis seems certain to reduce net migration numbers, but it's not certain how the care sector will find the staff it needs.\nPanorama - Immigration: The UK's Record Rise\nRos Atkins explores how net migration to the UK has hi",
    "A Nigerian court has sentenced a Chinese businessman to death after being found guilty of murdering his girlfriend Ummu Kulthum Sani in 2022.\nFrank Geng Quarong was discovered in her room after having stabbed her several times there.\nThe killing of the 22-year-old university student shocked Nigerians and the case was closely followed.\nDeath sentences are rarely carried out in Nigeria. Quarong has 90 days to appeal against the verdict.\nSpeaking on behalf of the family, the victim's brother, Sadiq Sani, described the sentence of death by hanging handed down by the court in Kano as justice. He said that whoever kills anyone deserved to be killed too.\n\"We thank God for showing us this day... I pray that my sister's soul continues to rest in peace,\" he told the BBC.\nHer family remember the young agriculture undergraduate as kind and jovial.\nQuarong, 49, and Ms Sani had been in a relationship since 2020 after having met in a shopping mall, according to Mr Sani.\nHe was in the country working for a Nigerian textiles firm.\nTalking shortly after the killing in September 2022, family friend Ahmad Abdullahi described what had happened.\nHe remembered coming to the family home and seeing that \"a lot of people had gathered outside the house\".\n\"That was when we knew something bad had happened. Geng was her boyfriend and had good relations with her family prior to that day.\n\"Before the incident they were having issues as she was no longer interested and he didn't want to let go.\"\nAccording to neighbours, on the night of the killing Quarong was heard knocking heavily on the gate to the Sani family home.\nWhen Ms Sani's mother opened the gate he pushed her aside and rushed straight to Ms Sani's room, locking it from the inside.\nHer shouts and cries attracted the family and before anyone could break down the door to help she had been stabbed several times.\nShe died later in hospital.\nNigeria currently has more than 3,400 people on death row and the last execution was carried out in 2012.",
    "A dinner menu signed by Albert Einstein has sold at auction for \u00c2\u00a318,000.\nIt was used at a reception at the Savoy Hotel in London in 1930, when a committee of prominent figures met to raise funds for Jewish communities in Europe.\nOther guests at the dinner included the playwright George Bernard Shaw, and author, H. G. Wells.\nLawrence Auctioneers in Crewkerne, Somerset, sold the document on Thursday.\nSophie Tregarthen-Leisk, from the auctioneers, said: \"It's been a really interesting document to spend a few weeks cataloguing.\"\nEinstein was the guest of honour at the dinner, which was attended by more than 370 people at a time when the influence of the Nazi Party was growing in Europe.\nPrior to being sold, the menu had been kept at a family home in Westbury, Wiltshire.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Somerset, Ms Tregarthen-Leisk said it is a \"rather interesting story\" of how the previous owner came to acquire the artefact, after their grandfather purchased it for an undisclosed amount in the 1980s.\n\"It's been in their collection ever since then and it's been passed down through the family with them not really being sure whether it was authentic, and them not really knowing much about the history behind it.\"\nDuring Germany's federal elections of 1930, the Nazi party gained a significant number of seats in the Reichstag, to form the second-largest voting block in the German Parliament.\n\"That turning point, which is the most interesting part of the dinner, [led to] people knowing there was some oppression coming, but not knowing to what extent it would unfortunately turn into,\" Ms Tregarthen-Leisk said.\nShe added that the auctioneers were not aware of the \"importance\" or \"political interest\" of the item at first.\n\"[The previous owners] knew it could be special, but I think both them and us as the auctioneers didn't realise how special it was.\n\"For them, it's an incredible story.

    "Pizza chain Papa Johns has said it will close nearly a tenth of its UK restaurants - all of which it says are \"underperforming\".\nThe closures follow a review of the business which identified sites that were \"no longer financially viable\".\nThe chain, which has 450 restaurants plus others in service stations and holiday parks, will close 43 sites but has not said how many jobs will be hit.\nSeparately, Revolution Bars has said it could sell \"all or part of the group\".\nIts announcement followed reports that said Revolution could shut about 20 bars, or a roughly a quarter of its outlets.\nAnnouncing the Papa Johns site closures, UK managing director Chris Phylactou said: \"Our priority is our team members, who will be fully supported throughout this process.\n\"Our goal is to work with impacted team members and attempt to find redeployment opportunities where available.\"\nThe closures are all in England and extend from Harrogate, North Yorkshire to St Helens, Merseyside, Billericay, Essex and Eastbourne, East Sussex.\nAll of them were \"underperforming locations that are no longer financially viable\", the company said.\nWhile other sectors of the hospitality industry have faced serious problems in recent years, takeaway outlets in general are booming, according to consultancy PwC.\nIt said last year, a net 151 chain takeaway shops opened.\n\"It's a good sector to be in, albeit that there's a lot more competition as others open,\" said PwC senior retail adviser Kien Tan.\n\"There's increasing consumer demand for takeaway and for takeaway outlets. If you're trading down from eating out or going out it's more affordable than going out for the evening.\"\nPapa Johns had previously said it planned \"strategic closures\" in order to free up money for investment and improving profitability at its remaining UK sites.\nIt plans to expand further into non-traditional sites like holiday parks and the chain said it would \"announce other large retail partners in the coming months\".\nUS-owned Papa Johns said the UK was its second biggest market and it was \"committed to driving growth in the UK and improving results over the long term\".\nRevolution Bars, which also owns Revolucion de Cuba, said that following a period of \"external challenges\" which had hit trading it was \"actively exploring all the strategic options available to it to improve the future prospects of the group\".\nThis could include restructuring parts of the group or a sale of \"all or part of\" the group, it said.\nRevolution also said it was talking to \"key shareholders\" and other investors about raising extra funds.\nWhen the company reported on trading in January, it said that the Revolution brand was underperforming because the cost of living crisis had hit younger people harder.\nEarlier this month, figures showed there was a rise in new retail outlets opened last year, dominated by coffee drive-throughs, bubble tea shops and fast food restaurants, mostly located outside city centres.\nBut according to PwC, which analysed data compiled by the Local Data Company, the openings were not enough to outweigh the places where chains, such as Wilko, shut up shop, and there was a net decrease of 5,000 stores across the UK.\nSo far this year, the Body Shop and night club chain Pryzm have already run into difficulties, announcing the closure of sites.",

    "The FBI is investigating a January Alaska Airlines flight, where a door plug on the aircraft, a Boeing 737 Max 9, blew out mid-air.\nA criminal probe was confirmed by the FBI in a letter sent to those aboard the plane, identifying them as \"victims\".\nNone of the 177 passengers and crew were killed, but some were injured.\nA group has since sued Alaska Airlines for \"serious emotional distress, fear and anxiety\".\nThe FBI letters, sent to passengers on 19 March by a victim specialist within the FBI's Seattle Division, said that the criminal investigation may be \"lengthy\".\nThey added that updates on the probe's progress could not be shared at this time.\nThe letters confirm early media reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) had launched a criminal investigation into the Boeing jetliner blowout, which occurred on a 5 January flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California.\nSources familiar with the investigation told the BBC's US news partner CBS in early March that the probe will look into whether Boeing violated an agreement it entered with the Justice Department in 2021, following two crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft.\nMore than 300 people died in the two crashes of Boeing's Max planes in 2018 and 2019.\nBoeing has not commented on the ongoing criminal probe.\nIn a statement shared with media after news of the DOJ investigation emerged, Alaska Airlines said a federal probe is normal \"in an event like this\".\n\"We are fully cooperating and do not believe we are a target of the investigation,\" said the airline.\nThe Alaska Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing in Portland after an outer section of the plane fell off shortly after take-off.\nThe loss of that section caused an uncontrolled decompression inside the aircraft, where passengers say they had to \"hold on for dear life\".\nOne passenger, Cuong Tran, told the BBC that his seat belt saved him as his phone, socks and shoes were ripped off 16,000ft above ground.\nMr Tran, who was sitting next to his friend one row behind the section which blew out, said he suffered injuries including a laceration to his leg.\nImages shared online - and later by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) - showed a wide hole in the side of the Boeing 737-9 Max aircraft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling.\nThe missing section of the plane was later found in the back garden of a Portland school teacher's home.\nIn a preliminary investigation US regulators found four critical bolts - meant to hold the so-called door plug in place - were missing from the flight.\nShortly after the incident, officials from the NTSB said that Boeing had also placed restrictions on the plane involved in the incident days before it took off.\nThe jet had been prevented from making long-haul flights over water, said NTSB chief Jennifer Homendy, after pilots reported pressurisation warning lights on three previous flights made on that specific plane.\nThe decision to restrict lengthy flights over water was so that the plane \"could return very quickly to an airport\" in the event the warnings happened again, she said.",
    "The girlfriend of footballer Cody Fisher has described the moment she comforted him as he lay dying in a Birmingham nightclub.\nJess Chatwin had been enjoying a night out with Mr Fisher and friends at Crane in Digbeth on 26 December 2022 when a group of masked men attacked him on the dance floor.\nThey had smuggled in a large knife with a serrated blade which was plunged into the 23-year-old's chest, causing him to collapse and ultimately die among more than 2,000 revellers.\nRemy Gordon and Kami Carpenter were convicted of his murder after a 10-week trial. A third defendant, Reegan Anderson, was cleared of murder and manslaughter but convicted of affray.\nWhen she realised her boyfriend had been stabbed, Ms Chatwin said she needed to be at his side and reassure him \"before it was too late\".\n\"So I just kept telling him that I loved him and I was here,\" she said.\nThe couple had been inseparable for much of the previous three years and she described them as \"two peas in a pod\".\n\"He was like, my best friend in the world. I'd tell him everything\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we did anything and everything together,\" she said.\nMr Fisher's fate was sealed after he had brushed past Gordon two days before at Popworld, a busy bar in Solihull.\nHis best friend Dan Vann, who was with him, said the incident was so minor they thought nothing more of it.\n\"Literally nothing happened,\" he said. They had \"just gently tapped this kid on the back\" as they walked out to leave.\nBut Gordon wanted revenge and spent the next 48 hours trying to find out who they were.\n'The biggest heart'\nDespite the ski masks and balaclavas, Mr Vann, 24, said he recognised Gordon among the group approaching them in Crane.\n\"I saw his face, and I just like the connection made in my head straight away, thinking, 'that's the lad from Christmas Eve',\" he said.\nHe did not know if it was coincidence he was there, but said he felt scared he would be stabbed as well.\nMs Chatwin said they had decided to go to Crane about a month before the event and a group of them booked to stay at an apartment in the city.\nThe couple had met through mutual friends in 2019 and instantly clicked.\n\"I used to say to him, 'I feel like I've known you forever',\" she said.\n\"He had the biggest heart... He really just cared about everyone [and] just wanted the best for everyone.\"\nWhen the men approached them in the club, Ms Chatwin said she first thought her boyfriend was going to be robbed and took his shoulder bag off him.\nShe said Mr Fisher was \"as confused as everybody else was\" at what was going on.\nWhile his instinct was to get out of the club with Ms Chatwin, she said one of the attackers smacked a drink out of his hand and then he was headbutted.\n\"And then straight after they just started punching him, and then all these other people started coming out of the crowd from nowhere, and this big fight just came out,\" she said. \"And I remember the crowd just moving.\"\nShe hit one attacker on the head before looking for Mr Fisher, who was suddenly on the floor.\nAt first she thought he had been knocked out and was \"trying to wake him up\".\nBut as she tried to move him sideways into the recovery position, she felt something in the way and then discovered the knife in his chest.\nShe was screaming when security staff arrived to give him CPR and then Mr Vann, who did not fully know what had happened, put his arms around her.\n\"I thought he'd just been knocked out,\" he said.\n\"But obviously Jess was then screaming and crying her eyes out, so I grabbed her to comfort her, and that's when she shouted, 'why have they got knives in here?' Then that's when I realised he'd been stabbed.\"\nPolice and paramedics arrived and the pair were taken away from Mr Fisher into a room. Ms Chatwin said she then knew her boyfriend had died.\n\"Dan was like... this is Code, he's going to pull through. This is Cody we're talking about and then I just saw them walking in... and I knew what they were going to say,\" she said.\nWash off his blood\nAfter hearing the news, she said she lost the feeling in her legs and was helped outside.\nShe said the \"sky was blue\" from the lights of police cars and ambulances and she felt she was in a \"horror movie\".\nWhen she got home, her mother and sister helped her wash her boyfriend's blood off her legs.\nHours later when she met Mr Fisher's mother the pair hugged and cried together, she said.\n\"It's the realization that that has actually just happened as much as you're telling yourself it hasn't and it's all just been a bad dream and I'm going to wake up and he's still going to be here,\" she said.\n\"The whole night just replays in my head. Every single day. Every single night before you go to sleep.\n\"Everything reminds me of Code. Everything. Driving my car, I've still got the last Lucozade bottle he drank on Christmas Eve. He left it in my car, and it's still there.\"\nMr Vann said he and Ms Chatwin had become good friends because of what had happened and helped each other cope, but was unsure if he would ever get over",

    "The British Museum has launched proceedings against a former staff member who they believe stole and damaged at least 1,800 of its items.\nThe High Court has ordered the disclosure of eBay and PayPal records from the eBay account of the suspect, former curator Dr Peter Higgs.\nThe museum says these records contain evidence of its items being sold online.\nThe court was told Dr Higgs intended to dispute the claims.\nHe was too unwell to attend the proceedings but the court was told he was aware of the hearing.\nThe museum told the court they now have evidence Dr Higgs was selling items from the collection for over 10 years, to at least 45 buyers from all around the world, and covered his tracks \"using false names, creating false documents and manipulating records\".\nThe court has also ordered Dr Higgs to share any information he has on what was sold from the collection and the items' whereabouts.\nMissing and stolen gems\nThe museum says many of the missing and stolen items came from unregistered collections held in storage, which had no individual record in any of the museum's catalogues.\nThe museum's legal representatives, Daniel Burgess and Warren Fitt, told the court how a 1993 audit of a storeroom showed that there were 1,449 unregistered items present, but during another audit in 2023, 1,161 - just over 80% of those items - were missing from the same storeroom.\nDr Higgs worked within the museum's department of Greece and Rome from 1999 until the summer of 2023 and has denied all the claims.\nHe was promoted to acting keeper of the department in January 2021, a position described by Mr Burgess as a \"very senior and prestigious position\".\nThe cameo\nThe museum highlighted one example of an item listed by Dr Higgs on eBay, and subsequently removed, where they felt the evidence linking him to the item was particularly strong.\nIn this instance, a cameo fragment that was registered as belonging to the museum, had been advertised on eBay on Dr Higgs' eBay account before being removed from sale a few hours later.\nThe museum told the court their evidence showed that Dr Higgs had altered the Museum's record of the item on the same day so that a picture taken of it no longer appeared next to its catalogue entry.\nThe museum's legal representative, Mr Burgess, told the court that 356 stolen items have been returned to the museum to date and that any more information could assist in the recovery of missing items.\nAltering records\nIn 2021, Mr Burgess said the museum believes Dr Higgs tried to cover his tracks in the museum after he was alerted to suspicions about him.\nDr Higgs was acting head of the department of Greece and Rome at that time.\nThe suspect edited at least 83 digital internal records which related to stolen, damaged or missing items, the court heard.\nThe court was told that the Metropolitan Police searched the suspect's home in August 2023 and seized a collection of ancient bronze coins and medals which the museum says matches a collection of registered and unregistered coins kept in the museum's Greek and Roman department. The museum said Dr Higgs had denied this to them, claiming the coins and medals came from a deceased relative, the court heard.\nThe police also seized handwritten notes and printed instructions on how to edit the museum's records.\nIn her judgement, Justice Williams granted the British Museum's request for Dr Higgs to be ordered to disclose information surrounding items taken from the collection and their whereabouts, alongside their request for the disclosure of his eBay and PayPal records.",
    "Millions of women born in the 1950s have long been furious about not being told in a timely way that they would be affected by the rising state pension age.\nNow the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman has published a report saying they should be compensated .\nThe BBC spoke to women hit by the pension age change for their reaction to the report.\n'I'm angry - they stole from me'\nCarole Cooper, 68, from south Cambridgeshire, says the government has \"stolen \u00c2\u00a345,000\" from her.\nShe should have retired in 2015 and had no idea that she wasn't going to be paid her state pension. She only found out by applying for her bus pass and being told she wasn't old enough.\n\"I worked hard all my life and then I had to wait a whole six years with no income.\"\nShe had to spend \u00c2\u00a320,000 by taking a big chunk of money out of a private pension pot to re-train in healthcare, including reiki, to make some income until she turned 66.\nCarole says she is angry about the level of compensation suggested by the ombudsman of between \u00c2\u00a31,000 and \u00c2\u00a32,950.\n\"I don't want compensation, I want the money you have stolen from me,\" she says.\nWhen she first started work at 16 she was told her National Insurance would go towards her healthcare and pension.\nCarole feels the government \"changed the goal posts\" and owes her.\n'It would have been better had we had a pension from 60'\nAudrey Evans, 66, from Nottingham, says she feels \"really aggrieved that the government have changed the age as they went along\".\n\"They haven't considered the impact on women,\" she says, adding that people who were born in the 1950s tended to work from a much younger age.\nShe was just 14 when she started working full-time in a sewing machine factory.\nEventually she qualified as a nurse and spent the rest of her career in the caring profession.\nHaving to postpone retirement had a \"devastating impact\" on her life as her husband is nine years older, so he was 74 before they could retire together.\n\"That's a massive gap in the quality of retired life together,\" she says. \"The government basically robbed us of precious years together, a total injustice.\"\nThe possibility of compensation \"would be some recognition that we were hardly done by,\" she says, but it \"would have been better had we had a pension from 60\".\n'The government should be ashamed'\nDomitila Paz-Riley, 71, moved to Liverpool from Honduras in 1976 to be with her first husband. She initially got a job as a library assistant at Liverpool County Council, and later in health and beauty.\nShe stopped working in 2012, but says she didn't get her pension money until 2014.\n\"It didn't click that I wasn't going to get money until I saw it on the news. I was going through a divorce at the time so it wasn't easy.\n\"I was thinking, 'why have I not been told that I won't get any pension until two years later?' I didn't receive a letter or anything.\"\nLuckily, she was able to get her council pension as a lump sum - just under \u00c2\u00a38,000 after tax - which she managed with until she got her state pension.\nDomitila says the ombudsman's report is \"like a victory in a way, but disappointing\".\n\"The people writing the report had the power to suggest something better for us,\" she says.\n\"We didn't get paid. I put in 30 years of contributions because that's what you have to do. What about other women who worked 40-50 years? The government should be ashamed. Those women deserve compensation. There are women out there who won't have managed.\"\n'It may not help me'\nPat Pollington, 70, from the Isle of Wight, had to work four years longer than she had planned to get her pension after a career working with technology and then renewables firms.\nShe says that even though the ombudsman has recommended compensation, that is no guarantee that the government will pay out.\nEven if Parliament does decide to give compensation, she says it could end up as a similar situation to delays to payouts for sub-postmasters in the Horizon scandal, where some have died before getting any money.\n\"It may not help me,\" she says. \"Once you've got women going into their 70s, you've got a lot less time. There will be women who've passed away before we get this money.\"\n\"The clock is ticking,\" she adds. \"The longer they [the government] prevaricate, the less women they'll have to pay out to.\"\n'The level of compensation is highly disappointing'\nMichele Carlile in London had to give up a senior role in education at the age of 59 after suffering a heart attack.\nMichele, who was born in 1954, told the BBC she thought she would be eligible for the state pension as she was about to turn 60 and was shocked to find out she wasn't.\n\"That has had a terrible effect. Right at the start I had no way of paying my mortgage, I had to go and stay with my son so that I could rent my property.\n\"Then, just as we were getting to grips with that, suddenly in 2011 the coalition [government] upped it for my age group by a considerable amount, another couple of years.\"\nShe says it's good the ombudsman ",

    "The Times leads with the findings of the survey which suggests that satisfaction with the NHS has fallen to an historic low, with only a quarter of the British public believing that it is working.\nThe paper quotes experts as saying people feel trapped in a \"toxic relationship\" with the health service - supporting it on principle but increasingly fed up, sick and anxious because of its failures. One campaigner tells the Daily Telegraph the NHS has plunged from being the pride of Britain \"to an organisation that people moan about nearly as much as the weather\".\nDramatic pictures of the twisted wreckage of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore feature on many front pages.\nThe Sun says it was \"gone in three seconds\" after being hit by a container ship, which the paper says suffered a \"catastrophic engine failure.\" The Guardian has a close-up of the ship's bow , which was sliced open by the falling bridge. It says the vessel was also involved in a collision in the port of Antwerp in Belgium, in 2016. The Times says that an inspection of the ship at the time found it had \"hull damage impairing its seaworthiness\".\nThe Guardian reports that the CBI has used gagging clauses to prevent staff discussing their experiences of sexual misconduct and bullying at the business organisation. Sources tell the paper that up to 10 non-disclosure agreements have been signed in the past year accompanied by substantial financial settlements.\nThe new revelations come months after the business group was engulfed in a crisis over allegations including sexual harassment and misconduct. Advisers tell the paper that the Guardian's report calls into question the CBI's commitment to fostering a \"speak up\" culture. The CBI says it does not believe the agreements would prevent staff from taking complaints to the police.\nThe Daily Mail describes as a \"fiasco\" the granting of asylum to the man who attacked a woman and her children in Clapham with an alkali substance. The paper says Abdul Shokoor Ezedi won his appeal to stay in the UK despite the immigration judge conceding he had repeatedly \"not been honest\".\nThe Telegraph says evidence given by a Baptist church minister was \"critical\" in persuading the judge to allow Ezedi to remain, after he had claimed to have converted to Christianity. The Daily Express concludes that \"the consequences of this bureaucratic bungling are as tragic as they are shameful\".\nThe i says the state pension age may rise to 68 sooner than previously thought, because Rishi Sunak is committed to the triple lock - which says the state pension will rise by average wages, average prices or 2.5%.

    "BBC Woman's Hour presenter Emma Barnett this week wrote about the heartbreak of losing a baby and how receiving a certificate to mark the miscarriage has helped her family. Here, other women share their thoughts and feelings about the government's new scheme for bereaved parents to commemorate pregnancy losses.\nThis article contains details that may be upsetting.\n'Something we can put in our memory keepsake box'\nI suffered a missed miscarriage in 2020 - my husband and I were devastated. It's not something we talk about very often, but I will never forget my baby who died - the loss is part of me. I also want to have a really open and honest conversation with my children about pregnancy loss.\nMy son, who is six, knows about his little baby brother or sister who died in mummy's tummy. Having an official document that proves our baby existed, something we can put in our memory keepsake box, to talk about for years to come, is important to me. Laura\n'I now have four of these certificates'\nThe morning baby loss certificates were launched I found myself pouring my details into the website to apply. It was really cathartic - I was surprised by how therapeutic it felt. We have lost four pregnancies over the last three years and I now have four of these certificates.\nThey are very official documents - they come in a big envelope, and although I won't be framing or displaying them, the fact that this information exists somewhere outside my mind is reassuring. None of the details seem to be on my medical record. Frustratingly, I am asked to recount them whenever relevant in conversations with GPs. My certificates are proof that these experiences happened and they validate the trauma of my losses. Holly\n'Gives this baby an identity beyond my sadness'\nWe had a scan and heard its little heart beating. We had a picture, a due date, and so much hope. A month later we went into lockdown and I began to bleed. I went to hospital alone, wearing homemade PPE and the worst was confirmed. They said I could stay as I was bleeding heavily, but I was too scared, so I managed at home, trying to hide my tears and the bleeding from my four year old. I passed the tiny baby and kept it in a box, before burying it under a tree in the garden.\nI never spoke to a medical professional about it again, and by the time I saw family and friends things had moved on. I never got to grieve in the way I now know I needed to. I didn't think I needed a piece of paper, but slowly something shifted in me. Having a certificate for this baby will give it an identity beyond my sadness. Lucinda\n'A certificate would help me grieve'\nI haven't yet applied for the certificate but I am considering it. On the day of my 12-week scan, instead of hearing how my baby was doing I was being told my baby was gone. To deal with my emotions I kept using the phrase \"it wasn't viable\", as that was what I was constantly being told by medical professionals.\nWhen I was miscarrying I was asked what I would want to do with the \"remains\" - I said nothing as it all felt so unreal. I have huge regret and guilt about how my baby passed. This certificate would help me continue the process of grief and hopefully change conversations going forward for families . Ally\nWhat are baby loss certificates?\n'I can't reduce these babies to a piece of paper'\nI have had three positive pregnancy test results and miscarried three times. One pregnancy lasted longer than the others - I saw the baby's heartbeat at an early scan, I had a scan photo. I feel confused about whether I apply for a baby loss certificate for this pregnancy or for all three. I think I'm still holding on to those messages that if it's early it doesn't count.\nI hope these certificates mean people feel they can talk about their losses and that every positive pregnancy that ends in unwanted miscarriage will be recognised and registered - that women will no longer have to question if their baby counted . Lizie\n'I have such mixed feelings'\nI have such mixed feelings about what to do. I have had 15 rounds of IVF and five pregnancies. I have a little boy who is five and have had four second-trimester miscarriages. I am hugely affected on a daily basis by my losses. I really like the idea of the certificates but have not been able to get past the first page of the website without finding it all too difficult. It has highlighted how much trauma I still hold around my babies and how complicated the emotions are.\nI agree with people who say the certificates give legitimacy to my losses, they are more tangible if they are documented. However, I also feel I cannot reduce these much-loved, much-wanted, and much-missed babies to a piece of paper. I don't feel a certificate does them justice . Hannah\n'I have nothing to commemorate the babies'\nI lost my babies in the late 1970s but I still grieve, and I still wonder what the babies I lost would have become - especially around the time which would have been their birthdays.

    "Anne Hathaway has opened up about suffering a miscarriage in 2015 while acting as a pregnant woman in a play.\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair , the actress, 41, said her first pregnancy \"didn't work out\", adding: \"I was doing a play and I had to give birth on stage every night.\"\nHathaway, who has since had two sons, says that during the six-week show, she \"pretended everything was fine\".\nBut she says she told her friends the truth when they visited her backstage.\n\"It was too much to keep it in,\" she said.\nHathaway played a pilot who falls pregnant in the one-woman off-Broadway show Grounded, which ran for six weeks in 2015. The performance required her to act out going through childbirth every night.\nIt was during this time that Hathaway experienced a miscarriage.\nThe Devil Wears Prada star went on to welcome her first son, Jonathan, with husband Adam Shulman in March 2016.\nIn an Instagram post in July 2019, Hathaway announced she was pregnant again. But she also used the post to indicate her fertility struggles.\n\"It's not for a movie,\" she wrote, alongside a photo of her baby bump. \"All kidding aside, for everyone going through infertility and conception hell, please know it was not a straight line to either of my pregnancies. Sending you extra love.\"\n'Not ashamed'\nIn the interview, Hathaway explained her reasoning for writing that post.\n\"Given the pain I felt while trying to get pregnant,\" she said, \"it would've felt disingenuous to post something all the way happy when I know the story is much more nuanced than that for everyone.\"\nShe added she \"wasn't going to feel ashamed\" of something that seemed \"statistically to actually be quite normal\".\nAfter suffering her miscarriage, Hathaway said she was stunned to find out how common miscarriages are. She also found out that many of her friends had had similar experiences.\n\"I thought, where is this information? Why are we feeling so unnecessarily isolated? That's where we take on damage. So I decided that I was going to talk about it.\"\nShe said that for years after her Instagram post, women would regularly come up to her in tears.\n\"And I would just hold her, because she was carrying this [pain] around and suddenly it wasn't all hers anymore.\"\nThe couple's second son, Jack, was born in November 2019.\n\"When it did go well for me, having been on the other side of it, where you have to have the grace to be happy for someone, I wanted to let my sisters know, 'You don't have to always be graceful,'\" she said.\n\"'I see you and I've been you.'\"",
    "Hotel room shampoo bottles could be banned in Northern Ireland but not in the rest of the UK as a result of a change in EU rules.\nNorthern Ireland's post-Brexit deal, the Windsor Framework , means it continues to follow some EU laws, including rules on packaging.\nFrom 2030 the EU intends to ban some single use plastics including miniature toiletry products provided by hotels.\nThe Stormont Assembly could ask the government to veto the law change.\nThe potential impact on Northern Ireland was first reported by the Sunday Telegraph.\nThe EU has long planned an update of its packaging rules to encourage reduction, reuse and recycling.\nEarlier this month the European Parliament and the Council, which represent EU national leaders, reached a provisional agreement on the revamped rules.\nThe 2030 ban would also apply to individual portions of condiments and milk in cafes and restaurants, but not in takeaways.\nThe UK has already banned some some single use plastic products, such as cutlery and could ultimately end up with much the same rules as the EU.\nA series of updates to EU environmental rules could in theory lead to growing divergence between GB and NI.\nHowever that will depend on whether the UK government decides to voluntarily align with EU rules and whether businesses choose to produce to the EU standard.\nBaby food\nBrexit gives the UK the right to set its own regulatory standards but, in practice, some companies may just manufacture to a higher EU standard to protect their access to that market.\nThat phenomenon already exists and is known as \"the Brussels effect\".\nIt refers to non-EU companies adopting EU standards throughout their businesses, reflecting the size of the EU market and the relative strictness of its standards.\nFor example UK baby food manufacturers have already said they will produce in line with updated EU rules.\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly has two mechanisms by which it can ask the UK government to exempt Northern Ireland from new or updated EU laws.\nThe better known of these is the 'Stormont Brake ', which relates to updated or amended laws.\nIt allows 30 or more MLAs from two or more parties to petition the UK government to block an update to EU law from applying in Northern Ireland.\nThere is also an \"applicability motion\" which concerns the application of a completely new EU law.\nIf the Assembly has not expressed cross-community support for the law, via an applicability motion, the government will normally veto it.\nThe veto will not be applied if the government assesses that the new law would not create a new regulatory border between GB and Northern Ireland, or if exceptional circumstances apply.\nIf the government vetoes the law the EU could ultimately take \"appropriate remedial measures\".",
    "Senegal's ruling coalition candidate Amadou Ba has called the opposition's Bassirou Diomaye Faye to concede victory in Sunday's presidential election, a government official said.\nUnofficial results showed that Mr Faye had a strong lead over Mr Ba.\nMr Faye had been in prison 10 days before the vote and campaigned on the promise of radical change.\nOfficial results from an election which was originally due last month are expected in the coming days.\nThe vote followed months of political turmoil in one of Africa's most stable democracies, after outgoing President Macky Sall tried to postpone the election until December.\nSeveral of the other 15 candidates had already conceded.\nPresident Sall has also congratulated Mr Faye and said that it was a win for the people of Senegal.\nMr Faye, who turned 44 on Monday, ran as an independent. But he had been a senior member of the dissolved Pastef party, led by Ousmane Sonko, the popular figure who many thought would succeed Mr Sall.\nBut Mr Sonko was disqualified from the election because of a defamation conviction, which he said was politically motivated.

    "When K-pop star Karina posted a handwritten apology on Instagram earlier in March, it was both contrite and profuse.\n\"I sincerely apologise for surprising my fans who have supported me,\" the frontwoman of the girl group aespa wrote.\nHer offence?\nPublicly acknowledging that she was in a relationship with actor Lee Jae-wook.\nThat Karina felt compelled to say sorry for being in a relationship has puzzled many outside the K-pop scene, but it opens a window into the world of the industry's \"super fans\".\nThey stream their favourite stars' music round the clock - even if on mute while sleeping - to boost chart rankings, organise mass voting sessions during award seasons, and sometimes even sponsor digital billboard ads in places like Times Square, New York.\nPaying the price of love\nWhen news of Karina's relationship broke, some fans drove a truck to her management agency.\n\"We supported Karina's bright future, believing in a shared dream, but it was our misconception,\" blared an electronic billboard on the vehicle.\n\"Is the love given to you by your fans not enough?\" another read.\nThis stands in contrast to how celebrities' romantic lives are often publicised, and sometimes celebrated, in other parts of the world.\nTake Taylor Swift, for example, whose attendance at last month's Super Bowl to watch her boyfriend Travis Kelce is said to have singlehandedly boosted TV viewership of the game, making it the most-watched broadcast in the US since the 1969 Moon landing.\nPolls say one in five Super Bowl viewers were rooting for the Kansas City Chiefs - which eventually won the annual league - because of the pop star's relationship with Kelce.\nSo why are the attitudes different in K-pop?\n'A false intimacy'\n\"The fans feel jilted,\" said Korean media columnist Jeong Deok-hyeon, adding that K-pop fans often view themselves as being in parasocial relationships with the idols.\nThese refer to one-sided relationships where one party expends an overt amount of time, emotional energy and money on another whom they are fascinated with, but who may not know they exist.\n\"As the industry increasingly encourages fans to express their fandom through consumerism, their desire to be 'compensated' [for their investments] grows. This contributed to fans making demands which sometimes border on threats,\" Mr Jeong told the BBC.\nSome believe the artistes themselves and their management agencies have facilitated a \"false intimacy\" between idols and fans.\nEven as recently as 10 years ago, it was common practice for K-pop agencies to ban new stars from dating or even have a personal mobile phone.\nAgencies have also begun creating social apps for their artists which appear to offer fans a glimpse of their idols' everyday lives. SM, the K-pop-producing powerhouse behind groups like aespa, introduced an app in 2020 designed to look like a one-on-one messenger app, but is in fact a group chat where the idol drops messages for thousands of fans at once.\nSome stars have also bought gifts for fans or offered them one-on-one calls.\n\"K-pop agencies have been telling fans that they have the power to create stars,\" said Areum Jeong, an Assistant Professor of Korean Studies at Arizona State University.\nCedarbough Saeji from Pusan National University called the Karina incident \"a classic case of the fans trying to 'discipline' the stars\".\n\"They were angry about the dating, and then they got angry that she apologised in the 'wrong way',\" said Saeji, an assistant professor in Korean and East Asian Studies, referring to how some fans felt Karina should have posted her apology in a fans-only forum - rather than on a public platform.\n\"In 2024, privacy for K-pop stars, who live in this tiny country and are so widely recognized, is virtually impossible,\" she said.\nMs Jeong, who considers herself a dedicated K-pop fan, also takes part in \"fan labour\" by streaming the music of her favourite boyband NCT 127 and paying to vote for them on music platforms and award shows.\nThere are a dozen different digital music platforms for K-pop, each with its own Top 100 chart based on the number of people streaming and downloading songs. Super fans divide and conquer by organising themselves into teams to navigate the rules for each platform.\n\"Fans put in labour to ensure the group's success. They consider the idol a product. And if you want to see the product on the stage for a long time, the artistes, the fans, and the management will all have to put in hard work,\" Ms Jeong said.\nSome even share voting schedules and streaming guides with \"regular fans\", she added, so they can contribute to propelling their idols to the top of the charts.\nThe BBC browsed a \"streaming guide\" written up by fans of the boyband Seventeen, which includes reminders such as, \"Watch two or three other Seventeen music videos that totals to at least seven to 10 minutes. Then repeat the process\", and \"Do not pause, forward or rewind\".\nLarge fan groups organise themselves so that different members take on differe",

    "A retired teacher is claiming victory after the Wales flag was raised at one of Monmouthshire's most prominent buildings and the union jack lowered.\nShire Hall in Monmouth has agreed to fly the red dragon following a complaint by Peter Williams.\nHe said flying the UK flag displayed a lack of respect towards Welsh culture.\nShire Hall said it had been following UK government guidelines but was now flying the Red Dragon \"after feedback and comments from the community\".\nMr Williams has been in dispute with the building's management since last June, but the row escalated on 1 March this year when the former deputy head teacher realised the council-owned building - which houses a museum and is run by Monmouthshire council - was not following what staff had told him was its policy of flying the Welsh flag on St David's Day.\n\"It's a disgrace no Welsh flag was flown on St David's Day,\" Mr Williams told the Local Democracy Reporting Service .\nHe added he was told it was not flown on the Welsh patron saint's day because of a hail storm and a weak flag pole.\nHe established the venue had been following guidance on flag flying issued by the UK government that only applied to England.\nOnce this had been pointed out, Mr Williams said staff at the building were \"very supportive and dismayed by the situation\", and that the Welsh flag \"is now flying proudly on Monmouth Shire Hall\".\nIt is an 18th Century Grade I-listed building that was the location of the high treason trial for Chartist leaders for their role in the Newport Rising of the mid-19th century .\nMr Williams first raised concerns in June 2023 when he was told the union jack must be flown above the Welsh banner but the \"integrity of the flagpole\" meant that was not possible.\nStaff then emailed him a copy of the protocol it was following, titled UK Government: Flying Flags; A plain English Guide.\nMr Williams said he then pointed out the protocol applies only in England, and that he later received confirmation from the Welsh government it had issued no diktat to local authorities on flying flags from their buildings.\n\"I've had no response on who is responsible for implementing English guidelines here in Wales,\" said Mr Williams, who moved with his wife to Monmouthshire in November 2020.\nHe is originally from Aberdare but had spent more than 30 years living in the West Midlands in England.\nHe said he was concerned flying the union jack was symptomatic of a lack of respect towards Welsh culture in the area.\n\"I just picked up the vibe in Monmouth that there is anti-Welsh sentiment such as letters in the newspapers complaining about the Welsh language or bilingualism,\" he added.\nA Monmouthshire council spokesman said: \"After feedback and comments from the community about flying the Welsh flag, we are proudly doing so for the coming months at the Shire Hall.\n\"We will review options to consider flag mountings and future arrangements.\"",
    "Paul Alexander was six years old when he woke, terrified, to find himself inside a large metal tube, with only his head sticking out.\nHe couldn't move to feel what was trapping him, and when he tried to call for help, he discovered he couldn't make a sound.\nPaul had survived a serious bout of polio, but had been left quadriplegic. After an emergency tracheostomy operation, he was unable to breathe without the iron lung machine that now encased his small body.\nWhen he died recently at the age of 78, Paul had spent more than seven decades using his iron lung, longer than anyone else in history.\nBut what was it that marked him out from so many of his peers, and kept him going?\nPolio ran riot in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, killing and maiming scores of children.\nIn hospital in Texas in 1952, Paul was surrounded by other children in similar predicaments. According to the World Health Organization, one in 200 polio infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5-10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilised.\nUncertain future\nAfter two years in hospital, doctors began to cast doubt on Paul's future.\nThat led his parents to make the brave decision to take him and his iron lung home, to live out his days in peace. But instead of dying, Paul went from strength to strength, once he was home in his parents' care.\nThe iron lung uses a negative pressure system. Powered by a motor, its bellows suck air out of the cylinder, creating a vacuum around the patient's body and forcing the lungs to expand and take in air. When the air is let back in, the same process in reverse makes the lungs deflate. The device needs a source of energy to function.\nDuring power cuts, the bellows had to be pumped by hand; neighbours would come to help with the job. Paul's father designed an alarm bell that Paul could ring using his mouth if he needed urgent attention.\nOver time Paul learnt to consciously breathe by gulping down air, using his throat muscles to force air into his lungs. He called it frog-breathing.\nHis younger brother, Philip, explained to the BBC that the promise of a puppy gave Paul the incentive to be brave, and attempt to spend time out of his iron lung to learn the complicated glossopharyngeal breathing technique, the medical term for frog-breathing.\n\"He was scared of course of choking to death,\" says Philip. \"They told him if you last three minutes, you'll get the dog that you want.\" And he did.\nAs his confidence and strength grew, he was able to spend increasingly longer periods out of the iron lung. This allowed him to begin to experience a bit more of life. He was allowed to venture into the neighbourhood in his wheelchair with childhood friends, returning to the iron lung when he was tired.\n\"He was just a normal brother to me. We fought, we played, we loved, we partied, we went to concerts together - he was just a normal brother,\" says Philip.\nPaul finished school at home and went on to earn a college degree before setting his sights on law school.\nPhilip recalls Paul's time at the University of Texas in Austin as being \"incredible\". His parents helped Paul move in with his iron lung, and then he was on his own - with limited help at first, after the carer he had hired failed to show up.\n\"He didn't really have any caregivers. He was in the dorm and different people just took care of him accidentally. They pushed him around campus [in his wheelchair],\" says Philip.\nPaul went on to practise law in downtown Dallas.

    "Sam Bankman-Fried, the former billionaire crypto boss who was convicted of fraud and money laundering last year, will return to court in New York on Thursday to be sentenced for his crimes.\nIt is certain the 32-year-old will be going to jail; what is not known is how long for.\nThe moment has revived debate about the extent of his crimes - and what punishment might fit.\nHis legal team have called for leniency, but prosecutors are seeking 40 to 50 years in prison.\nThey say such a sentence is warranted for someone who lied to investors and banks, and stole billions in deposits from customers of his now-bankrupt crypto exchange, FTX.\nHis defence team has proposed five to 6.5 years, accusing the government of adopting \"a medieval view of punishment\" by insisting on a lengthy term behind bars for a non-violent, first-time criminal.\nThe question has generated hundreds of pages of letters from former FTX customers, family, friends of his parents - even complete strangers - trying to sway Judge Lewis Kaplan, the federal justice who will decide his fate.\n\"He has shown no remorse so why would any judge show any mercy?\" said Sunil Kavuri, a British investor who had more than $2m worth of holdings on the exchange when it collapsed, and one of the people mobilising former customers to share their experience with the court.\nFTX's collapse in 2022 was a stunning fall for Bankman-Fried, who had become a billionaire and business celebrity promoting the firm, a platform people could use to deposit and trade crypto.\nIt attracted millions of customers, before rumours of financial trouble sparked a run on deposits.\nIn November 2023, a US jury found Bankman-Fried had stolen billions in customer money from the exchange ahead of the collapse to buy property, make political donations and use for other investments.\nMany of those customers now appear poised to recover significant sums, under a plan being developed in the separate bankruptcy case.\nUnder that proposal, former customers could receive money based on what their holdings were worth at the time the exchange collapsed.\nIn court filings, the defence for Bankman-Fried, who is expected to appeal his conviction, has argued that such recovery warrants a lighter sentence.\nThey said it proved that \"money has always been available\" which \"would be impossible if [FTX's] assets had disappeared into Sam's personal pockets\".\nBut the repayment plan has left many former customers outraged, since they will miss out on the crypto rebound that has occurred since.\nJohn Ray, the lawyer leading FTX through bankruptcy and a critic of Bankman-Fried, noted the concerns in his own letter to court.\n\"Make no mistake; customers, non-governmental creditors, governmental creditors, and non-insider stockholders have suffered and continue to suffer,\" he wrote to the court, arguing that the claims of minimal loss were a sign that Bankman-Fried continued to live \"a life of delusion\".\nFormer FTX customers interviewed by the BBC said they were offended by the blithe dismissal of their problems, and urged the judge to reject calls for leniency.\n\"The people who are saying this are not in a position like I'm in, where you've lost everything,\" said Arush Sehgal, a 38-year-old tech entrepreneur living in Barcelona, who, with his wife, is one of the exchange's biggest individual creditors, with about $4m worth in savings in dollars and bitcoin at FTX when it collapsed.\nHe is one of the customers suing over the current bankruptcy plan, which he said amounted to a \"second crime\" against Bankman-Fried's customers.\nAngela Chang, of Vancouver, a 36-year-old who worked in software, said she had about $250,000 deposited in dollars with FTX when it collapsed. She said she feared the harm done to FTX customers was being discounted because they were in the crypto industry.\n\"People think that crypto is criminal and so they have sympathy for this guy .... But I'm not a criminal,\" she said, describing how the fall of the firm threw her into depression and left her running up credit card debt. Facing a cash crunch, she ultimately sold a portion of a claim to an investor.\nColumbia Law professor Daniel Richman said the scale of the crime was rarely as contested as in this case.\nBut he said decisions are often shaped more by other issues, including a judge's own impressions of the defendant, and what it would take to deter him from further crimes.\nIn this case, Judge Kaplan, a veteran of the court system who has presided over a slew of high profile trials involving public figures such as Donald Trump and actor Kevin Spacey, has already proven to be sceptical of Bankman-Fried's actions, revoking his bail last year after finding he was trying to intimidate other witnesses.\n\"Any judge or lawyer will tell you that one of the best things the defendant can do before being sentences is really really show he's on the right path, show some remorse and show some degree of self-knowledge as to his offence,\" Prof Richman said.\n\"Here you not onl",
    "The UK government is expected to link cyber-attacks which accessed personal details of millions of voters to China.\nThe attacks on the Electoral Commission took place in August 2021 but were only revealed last year.\nSeveral MPs and peers who have been critical of Beijing are thought to have also been targeted in cyber-attacks.\nThe prime minister called China \"the greatest state-based challenge to our national security\".\nRishi Sunak said: \"China represents an economic threat to our security and an epoch-defining challenge.\n\"So it is right we take steps to protect ourselves.\"\nThe BBC understands other Western nations will set out similar concerns.\nAcknowledging the attacks last August , the Electoral Commission said unspecified \"hostile actors\" had gained access to copies of the electoral registers and broken into its emails and \"control systems\", but added that it had neither had any impact on any elections nor anyone's registration status.\nThe commission said last August that they weren't able to predict exactly how many people could be affected, but that the register for each year contained the details of around 40 million people.\nDeputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden will address Parliament on Monday about the threat.\nIt is now thought that Mr Dowden will suggest those behind the attack had links to Beijing, as well as laying out how the UK will respond to what it deems a wider threat.\nPublicly identifying the attackers lays the groundwork for potential legal and political actions, such as sanctions or diplomatic protests.\nLinking the attackers to China, a fellow member of the UN Security Council, would be an escalation in the diplomatic tension between the two countries.\nThis marks a major change from just a few years ago, when British leaders aimed to usher in a \"Golden Age\" with China.\nThe prime minister then was David Cameron, who is now the foreign secretary after taking a seat in the House of  Lords last year.\nChina's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said the government cracked down and punished all types of malicious cyber activities.\nHe called on all parties to \"stop spreading false information and take a responsible attitude to jointly maintain peace and security in cyberspace\".\nChina's 'strategic threat'\nThe government is keen to stress it has already rejected or wound down Chinese investment in infrastructure in recent years on national security grounds.\nThree MPs who are among those thought to have been targeted - former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, former minister Tim Loughton and the SNP's Stewart McDonald - will receive a briefing from the head of parliamentary security.\nThey are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China which scrutinises, and often criticises, the activities of Beijing.\nMr Loughton told the BBC that \"for too long\" the government has not taken the \"strategic threat\" from China seriously.\nSpeaking on the Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4: \"We need to have a raft of senior Chinese officials seriously sanctioned because of what's been going on with this cyber attack, what's going on in Hong Kong [and] in Xinjiang\".\nLuke de Pulford, chair of the Inter-Party Alliance on China, said the government appeared to be \"reluctant, in general, to hold China to account for its abuses\".\nChina-backed cyber-attacks \"have been going on for a very long time\", he said, adding that politicians working with his group \"suffered impersonation emails sent in their names\" back in 2021.\nUK government concern over Chinese espionage and parliamentary interference has been rising.\nIn September 2023, a parliamentary researcher was arrested under the Official Secrets Act accused of spying for China.\nAnd a year before, an unusual parliamentary interference alert was issued regarding the activities of UK-based lawyer Christine Lee .\nMI5 alleged she had been carrying out political interference activities including donating funds to support the work of MPs. This was all said to be on behalf of China.\nChina has consistently denied accusations of espionage and wrong-doing.\nLabour's shadow Welsh secretary Jo Stevens has demanded \"a new strategy\" to tackle state threats.\nShe said that Labour is calling for \"closer working between the Home Office and the Foreign Office to coordinate the UK's strategic response to this growing threat both to domestic security and our electoral freedoms\".",

    "A Conservative MP has failed in his bid reverse London mayor Sadiq Khan's expansion of London's Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez).\nThe government indicated it would get behind Dartford MP Gareth Johnson's Private Members Bill.\nBut it ran out of Parliamentary time after Labour MPs kept the debate going.\nA central London Ulez, introduced in 2019 and designed to tackle air pollution, was extended to cover the whole of Greater London in August 2023.\nUnder Commons rules, Mr Johnson's bill now stands almost no chance of being becoming law unless it is adopted by the government.\nBut any legislation would have to be passed before a general election, expected later this year, and it is unlikely to be allocated enough Parliamentary time.\nIntervening during a 33-minute speech by Labour MP Lilian Greenwood. Mr Johnson said: \"It's obvious both she and the Labour Party wish to talk out my Bill.\"\nA \u00c2\u00a312.50 daily charge applies to driving in the zone if a vehicle does not meet emission standards.\nDrivers of buses, coaches and heavy goods vehicles that do not meet an emissions standard have to pay \u00c2\u00a3100 per day if they enter the separate Low Emission Zone , which covers the same area as Ulez.\nDowning Street denied \"riding roughshod\" over devolution by backing the bill, saying it was \"about making sure that communities and drivers are able to have their say on important issues\".\n\"The government has been consistent in supporting motorists and it's in line with that,\" a No 10 spokesperson said.\nUlez has proved particularly controversial in outer London boroughs, and was seen as a key factor in the Conservatives holding on to the parliamentary seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in a by-election in July 2023.\nFollowing that result, Sir Keir Starmer asked Mr Khan to reflect on the policy's impact. But appearing alongside him this week, the Labour leader said he did not want his children to \"breathe in dirty air\".\nOpponents of Ulez, including the Conservatives, have described it as an unfair tax on motorists, with many small traders saying they can not afford the extra costs incurred.\nThe mayor has argued it is needed to protect people's health by tackling toxic levels of air pollution.\n'Cruel tax'\nHe has cited his legal duty to take measures to meet air quality targets set by the government, and pointed out that his predecessor as mayor, Boris Johnson, announced plans in 2015 to introduce a similar zone.\nIn a report earlier this month . he claimed that since he was first elected in 2016, air quality had improved faster in London than the rest of the country, with Ulez a major factor.\nMr Khan said nitrogen dioxide pollution had been cut in half to the lowest annual level on record.\nThe Conservatives claimed he was hiding figures likely to show Ulez expansion had had only a negligible impact.\nDuring the debate on his bill, Mr Johnson described the UIez charge as a \"cruel tax\" on London's poorest people, who could not afford to upgrade their cars.\nIt was also unfair, he said, on businesses in outer London and neighbouring counties, and on people who lived near Greater London as they had \"no say on who the London mayor is\", adding \"the border between London and the home counties is not neat.\"\nThe Dartford MP argued it was a \"myth\" to say the expansion was about improving air quality. He said the mayor did not want to ban polluting vehicles, \"he wants to make money out of them\".\nNottingham South MP Ms Greenwood accused the Conservatives of using a serious public health issue \"for purely party political point-scoring\".\nAnother Labour MP. Stella Creasy, reminded the Commons that voters would soon \"have an opportunity to express an opinion at the ballot box\" on Ulez expansion, on 2 May.\nShe suggested the bill indicated Conservative MPs had \"no confidence in their mayoral candidate being able to win that argument\".\nTransport minister Guy Opperman confirmed the government supported the bill.\nAfter five Tory-led councils mounted a legal challenge to the expansion plan, the High Court ruled it was lawful last July.\nThe mayor said 95% of vehicles seen driving in London on an average day now met clean air standards , thanks tohis \u00c2\u00a3160m scrappage scheme.\nMr Khan has urged the government to fund a national scrappage scheme to cover the wider south-east.\nThere are 12 candidates for the London mayoral elections on 2 May.\nThey are:\nShyam Batra, independent\nCount Binface, independent\nRob Blackie, Liberal Democrats\nNatalie Campbell, independent\nHoward Cox, Reform UK\nAmy Gallagher, SDP\nZoe Garbett, Green Party\nTarun Ghulati, independent\nSusan Hall, Conservative Party\nSadiq Khan, Labour Party\nAndreas Michli, independent\nBrian Rose, London Real",

    "Mongolia's former prime minister bought two luxury apartments in New York City with the proceeds of a corrupt scheme, US authorities have alleged.\nProsecutors are seeking to seize the prime real estate in midtown Manhattan, worth a total of $14m (\u00c2\u00a311m).\nThey allege Sukhbaatar Batbold, who served as PM from 2009-2012, bought the flats after his family-controlled firm was awarded a major mining contract.\nMining is the key industry in Mongolia. Mr Batbold has denied the accusations.\nThe Mongolian politician, 60, still sits in parliament.\n\"Mr. Batbold looks forward to his day in court, when he will have the opportunity to defend himself against these unfounded claims,\" said his lawyer Orin Snyder in a statement reported by Reuters.\nUS federal prosecutors say he purchased two apartments just blocks away from Central Park, one at The Carlton House, a building just one block away on East 61st Street, and a condo unit in the The Park Imperial, a 70-storey glass skyscraper, just a few doors down from Carnegie Hall.\nThey have accused him of \"funnelling millions of dollars from mining contracts through illegitimate shell companies to finance his family's lavish lifestyle\".\n\"Batbold's alleged behavior - personally profiting off of public corruption comes at the expense of the law-abiding citizens he governed,\" said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge James Smith.\nUS prosecutors say when Mr Batbold was prime minister, a company he controlled through intermediaries was awarded a $68m mining contract despite the firm, known as Catrison, having no pre-existing mining operations or history. Its sole director was a former linguistics teacher.\nMillions of dollars from that mining contract and others was then siphoned into foreign bank accounts, and moved through shell companies. Some of that money was spent on the purchase of the Manhattan flats, US prosecutors said.\nTheir court claim says one of the apartments was used by Mr Batbold's eldest son, who listed the address as his postal address in the US.\nMr Batbold is not facing charges himself; but the properties could be subject to forfeiture by the state if prosecutors' claims are ruled valid by a court.",
    "Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has launched its first electric vehicle (EV) and started taking orders.\nAt the event the technology giant's chief executive Lei Jun said the standard SU7 model would be priced at 215,900 yuan ($29,872; \u00c2\u00a323,663) and the Max version would cost 299,900 yuan.\nThe firm says it got over 50,000 orders within the first 27 minutes of sales.\nXiaomi's entry into the electric car market comes as sales growth has slowed globally, triggering a price war.\nThe move sees the technology giant taking on EV rivals including Tesla and BYD. The starting price in China for Tesla's Model 3 is 245,900 yuan.\nMr Lei also said the SU7, which has drawn comparisons with Porsche's Taycan and Panamera models, would have a minimum range of 700km (435 miles), beating the Tesla Model 3's 567km.\nThe firm is hoping that the SU7's shared operating system with its phones, laptops and other devices will appeal to existing customers.\nXiaomi is the third-largest seller of smartphones worldwide with a market share of about 12%, according to research firm Counterpoint.\nThe SU7, which Xiaomi has been teasing since last year , has drawn comparisons to Porsche's Taycan and Panamera sports car models.\nIt will be made by a unit of state-owned car manufacturer BAIC Group at a plant in Beijing that can produce as many as 200,000 vehicles a year.\n\"While getting this far is itself quite an achievement, the ultimate achievement would be to demonstrate that there is a consumer market for Xiaomi as a smart EVs brand,\" Bill Russo of Automobility told the BBC.\nIn an indication of the challenges facing technology firms who want to make electric cars, iPhone maker Apple last month reportedly cancelled its plans to build an EV .\nMr Russo added that Xiaomi's entry into the car market reflected its confidence \"in the relevancy for their brand\" in China while Apple did not see enough potential in the EV market outside of China.\nXiaomi has said it will invest $10bn (\u00c2\u00a37.9bn) in its vehicles business over the next 10 years.\n\"The Chinese EV market is very mature and creates a very stable ecosystem for the EV manufacturers,\" said Abhishek Murali from research firm Rystad Energy.\n\"For example, the battery supply chain is very strong, and the charging network in the country is also growing to meet the growing EV feed.\"\nThe launch of Xiaomi's first car comes as a price war in China's EV market has been intensifying.\nTesla, which is headed by multi-billionaire Elon Musk, has cut the cost of its cars in China by thousands of dollars in recent months as local rivals like the world's top-selling EV maker BYD have slashed prices.\nThe world's biggest car market is already crowded so Xiaomi is one of the few new prospective entrants to gain approval from authorities as officials try to curb a flood of new players.\nEarlier this week, BYD posted record annual profits but said growth had slowed towards the end of last year.\nShanghai-based electric car maker Nio on Wednesday lowered its forecast for first quarter deliveries as consumers tightened spending as China's economic growth weakens.\nAmerican EV giant Tesla is due to announce its delivery numbers for the first three months of 2024 next week.\nAt the same time, governments around the world are pushing back against imports of foreign-made EVs.\nOn Tuesday, Beijing initiated dispute settlement proceedings against the US at the World Trade Organization to contest \"discriminatory subsidies\" under the US Inflation Reduction Act.\nMeanwhile, the European Union has launched an investigation into whether Chinese government subsidies have helped the country's electric car makers undercut European-made models.",

He was never going to do it.\"\nSituated eight miles north of Aberdeen, the Menie Estate was a windswept stretch of sand dunes, meadows and woodlands before Donald Trump unveiled plans in 2006 to transform it into what he promised would be the world's greatest golf course.\nThe first official announcement by Trump International Golf Links anticipated that costs would be \"in excess of $500m\" - but by the time Mr Trump landed in Scotland and got in front of the TV cameras it had become a \u00c2\u00a31bn development.\nThe plans got the backing of a sizable chunk of the local business community, won over by the scale of promised investment that would attract major golf tournaments.\nBut those who had chosen this quiet spot by the North Sea to live were dismayed from the outset.\nMenie residents refused to sell up to Mr Trump and he famously accused local farmer and salmon fisherman Michael Forbes of living in a \"pig-like atmosphere\".\nEnvironmentalists were also concerned about the impact of the development.\nThe northern part of the course covered part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest regarded as one of Britain's best examples of a mobile sand dune system.\nAfter the course was built, Scotland's countryside watchdog ruled they had lost their special status as a nationally-important protected environment .\nPlanning permission was granted by Scottish ministers - who controversially overruled the local council's decision to throw out the application - on the basis that the potential economic benefit would outweigh environmental harm.\nThe Trump Organization has previously said it spent around \u00c2\u00a3100m on the Aberdeenshire golf resort but its latest accounts show the facility has a net book value of \u00c2\u00a333.2m and 81 employees.\nIn addition to the golf course, the original proposal also included approval for a 450-room hotel, 950 holiday apartments, 36 golf villas and 500 houses for sale.\nNone of these elements, and the thousands of new jobs promised, have materialised so far - and the golf resort has yet to turn a profit, racking up \u00c2\u00a313.3m in losses since it opened.\nTrump International Golf Links course was last year included in a New York civil court ruling that the former president and his company had misrepresented his wealth, including a \"false valuation\" of the Aberdeenshire course . Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing in this case.\nMr Hobday, who has managed golf stars such as Colin Montgomerie and Sam Torrance, was instrumental in persuading Mr Tump to build the new course in Scotland.\nLeafing through a Sunday newspaper in 2005, his eyes had lit up at an article suggesting Donald Trump was considering expanding his business empire in Europe.\n\"I thought, oh well, he's into golf and he's into property and development and he's half Scottish - maybe I should give him a call,\" he explained.\nWithin months he was standing in Mr Trump's office in New York, flanked by Scottish government officials, making the case for investing in a golf course capable of hosting The Open in Aberdeenshire.\nMr Hobday then spent five years helping to develop the Aberdeenshire golf project before quitting in 2010 .\n'Steadfast commitment'\nTrump International Scotland has previously said that the 2008 financial crash and the Covid pandemic had slowed the pace of its development plans in Aberdeenshire.\nA statement from the firm said it had invested \"hundreds of millions of pounds into the Scottish economy\" and that both the Menie course and Trump Turnberry are \"globally acclaimed and responsible for driving thousands of international visitors into the country each year\".\nIt added: \"There are very few, if any, investors in the sport",
    "More living people than dead people were depicted on statues and sculptures in 2023, according to new data seen by BBC News.\nIt is the first time this century that this has happened and reflects a drive to celebrate more people of colour, said Art UK, which compiled the data.\nMore than a third of all monuments unveiled last year are of black people.\nBut overall, the people depicted in public sculpture remain \"overwhelmingly white men\", the charity said.\nOnly 2% of public statues - defined as those in the public realm - across the UK are dedicated to people belonging to ethnic minorities figures, while just 17% are of women, its figures show.\n\"With so many public artworks dedicated to white men across the UK, installed over hundreds of years, it is unlikely that the balance will ever be redressed,\" said Art UK.\nTwenty six named people were depicted in the new sculptures put up across the UK last year, according to Art UK.\nOf the 26, 11 commemorate people who have already died, while 15 honour people who are still alive.\nTen were black men and women, all of whom are either still alive or have recently died.\nThey include cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, 24, who was honoured last April with a steel tribute in Nottingham, where he is from.\nA steel sculpture depicting comedian Sir Lenny Henry, 65, was unveiled in a park in Birmingham last February .\n\"By commemorating living people, you're able to shine a light on a much more diverse group of people,\" Katey Goodwin, deputy chief executive of Art UK, told BBC News.\n\"These are groups of people whose stories haven't been heard, or have been hidden, due to the way that history has been written. So it's about pulling out those stories.\"\nThe trend to commemorate living people has continued this year.\nEarlier this month, images of a statue of England's 30-year-old football captain Harry Kane were revealed ahead of it going on display .\nBut does getting a statue at a young age put a lot of pressure on the individual?\n\"I think it's down to that individual and how they perceive it,\" said Ms Goodwin. \"Most people are probably delighted to have a statue made of them. How they might feel about the statue in future... remains to be seen.\"\nStatues around the world were defaced as part of the Black Lives Matters protests, which swept the globe in 2020.\nIn Bristol, protesters tore down a statue of merchant and slave trader Edward Colston, sparking a national debate about how Britain's history is remembered.\nThere has also been criticism of the lack of monuments to women in public spaces.\nAn audit by Art UK three years ago found London has twice as many statues of animals as named women.\n\"If humankind vanished tomorrow and aliens arrived from another galaxy, they wouldn't be faulted for believing that the whole of human history was composed of men on horseback,\" a 2021 comment piece by the New York Times observed .\nIn recent years, various initiatives have been set up to try and improve diversity in the country's public spaces.\nLondon mayor Sadiq Khan set up a taskforce in the wake of the Black Lives Matters protests, to look at the city's statues, street names and memorials and \"ensure we tell the full story of our capital\".\nArt UK's latest figures show an uptick in the number of black people being commemorated across the country in 2023. In 2022, only one monument of a black person was put up, compared with 10 last year.\nBut there were no statues of people belonging to other other ethnic minorities unveiled in 2023, according to the data.\nOf the 26 people commemorated last year, 14 were men and 12 were women.\nEven then, the number of women was outnumbered by the number of animals, according to Art UK.\nWomen who did get honoured include Paralympian swimmer Ellie Simmonds, weightlifter Emily Campbell, and author Agatha Christie.\n\"The sculptures unveiled in 2023 have not made a large contribution to redressing the balance of people celebrated in public art,\" said Art UK.\n\"Overall, the people depicted and commemorated in public sculpture are still overwhelmingly white men.\"\nThe Fawcett Society, an equal-rights charity, said it was \"a crying shame\" that women, and particularly women of colour, were still vastly under-represented by public sculptures.\n\"It is surely worth considering who we, quite literally, put on a pedestal and why,\" its director of policy, Alesha De-Freitas, told BBC News.\n\"Public space is for everyone and should reflect our ambitions for an equal world - not an antiquated, sexist past.\"\nThe Race Equality Foundation said it was \"crucial\" to increase the representation of people belonging to ethnic minorities, across the UK.\nThe charity said that having a wide range of statues helped to educate society about the diversity of British history and the significant roles played by people from various ethnic backgrounds.\nHowever, it said that while having more diverse statues was important, it should not overshadow \"the urgent need to address structural racism and systemic inequ",

    "On a stormy night in March 1980, 22 British men were among more than 120 killed when a floating accommodation platform capsized in the North Sea oil fields. It was Norway's biggest ever industrial disaster but families of those who died say they are still seeking justice. The BBC joined some of them in their hunt for answers.\nOn a barren clifftop near Norway's self-professed oil capital Stavanger, an enormous metal chain erupts from the rock.\nBeneath it, cast on three weather-beaten copper panels, are the names of 123 men who lost their lives 200 miles (320km) out beyond the horizon.\nLaura Fleming brushes aside the red hair she inherited from her father Michael as she lays a single rose at the base of the Brutt Lenke (broken link in Norwegian) memorial.\nMr Fleming, a 37-year-old engineer, was one of five men from Cleator Moor in Cumbria who perished when the Alexander L Kielland platform capsized on 27 March 1980.\n\"I never say my dad died,\" Ms Fleming, who was six at the time and now lives in Durham, said.\n\"He was killed. Disasters happen, but this one shouldn't have done, it was entirely preventable.\"\nStanding beside her, Wayne Hunter nods in agreement.\nHaving been just four years old in March 1980, he never really knew his father Keith, also from Cleator Moor.\nMr Hunter was one of six men whose bodies were never found.\n\"It's like a grave for us,\" his son says about the broken chain. \"It's the only thing we've got.\n\"Being here, I do feel close to him.\"\nMr Hunter and Ms Fleming both grew up knowing their dads died at sea, but it was only two years ago they found out the extent of what happened. They were contacted and brought into the Kielland Network, a campaign group set up by grieving families in Norway.\nThe more information they got, the more answers they wanted\nOn the evening of 27 March 1980, their fathers were among 212 men aboard the Kielland, a French-built, semi-submersible platform named after a famous Norwegian writer, which served as a \"flotel\" for workers of the nearby Edda drilling rig.\nAt about 18:30, with 46mph winds and 40ft-high waves battering the Kielland, one of its five enormous legs snapped off.\nThe rig listed instantly to 30 degrees, sending men, debris and the four-storey accommodation block on its deck sprawling.\nSix anchor cables, unable to cope with the sudden extra strain, shattered, claiming a number of lives, while several of the seven 50-seater lifeboats were either unable to be freed from their suspension hooks or were dashed against the rig, killing those who had sought sanctuary inside.\nSeawater surged in through doors which were supposed to be shut. They had been propped open to allow cables and pipes to run through, as part of the rapid work going on board to convert the Kielland back into a drilling rig.\nDrill bits, tools and equipment flew across the decks, some smashing into men who, just moments before, had sat down to enjoy a western movie in the Kielland's makeshift cinema, fashioned from sheet walls.\nAfter 20 minutes or so, the final two cables holding the Kielland snapped, and the four-year-old, 10,000-tonne platform flipped over.\nWorkers on the nearby Edda used rescue baskets attached to cranes to try and pluck their friends and colleagues from the waves, while ships and helicopters tried to snatch people to safety.\nAmong the 89 survivors was Glaswegian John Aird, a friend and colleague of both Mr Fleming and Mr Hunter.\nThe day before the disaster, Mr Aird had been one of 12 men to make the regular commute from Teesside Airport near Middlesbrough to Norway, off to start the next of his two-week-long, 12-hour-a-day shifts.\nHe was the only one to return.\nMr Aird still vividly recalls what happened on that night 44 years ago.\nThe then-32-year-old had just finished his dinner in the canteen and taken his seat in the cinema when he heard an \"almighty bang\" and felt the world heave beneath his feet.\nSelf-preservation kicked in, and Mr Aird hauled himself up to the deck and into the nearest accommodation block to retrieve one of the lifejackets the men kept on top of their lockers.\nHe threw all the life preservers he could reach to other men, then pulled himself further up the sloping deck, away from the water now angrily smashing its way through windows and doors.\n\"I didn't feel any fear,\" he said. \"You just wanted to get away from where the hassle was.\"\nMr Aird got as high as he could and, with the storm still raging, looked around to assess his options.\nIt was then the final anchor cable severed and Mr Aird suddenly found himself plunged beneath the surface amid a confused mass of metalwork.\nMiraculously, he bobbed up between the web of metal legs and braces to break back through into the open air.\n\"When I was going under, that's when it hit me and I thought I wasn't going to survive it,\" Mr Aird said. \"It was just fate.\"\nAmong monstrous waves littered with other desperate men and detritus, he spotted a lifeboat emerge upside down a short swim away.\nHe knew the boa",

    "UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has made a renewed call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.\n\"It is time to silence the guns,\" he said, speaking from the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing with the enclave.\nHe also called on Israel to give \"total, unfettered\" access to humanitarian goods throughout Gaza.\nA UN-backed food security assessment this week said 1.1 million people in Gaza were struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation.\nIt added that a man-made famine in the north was imminent between now and May.\nMr Guterres, who said he had come to Rafah \"to spotlight the pain of Palestinians in Gaza\", was speaking a day after Russia and China blocked a US draft resolution put to the UN which called for a ceasefire tied to the release of hostages held in Gaza.\n\"It's time to truly flood Gaza with life-saving aid. The choice is clear: either surge or starvation. Blocked relief trucks on the Egyptian side of border are a moral outrage,\" said Mr Guterres, who also called for the release of Israeli hostages.\n\"I want Palestinians in Gaza to know: You are not alone. People around the world are outraged by the horrors we are all witnessing in real time. Palestinians in Gaza remain stuck in a non-stop nightmare,\" he added.\nSpeaking to BBC Middle East correspondent Hugo Bachega, Mr Guterres again urged Israel to lift the obstacles to the delivery of aid.\n\"It's obvious that these obstacles are part of the way this war is being conducted in relation to Gaza,\" he added.\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Israel Katz hit back at Guterres on X (formerly Twitter), saying the UN chief \"blamed Israel for the humanitarian situation in Gaza\" without condemning Hamas fighters who \"plunder\" aid.\nThe Rafah crossing is one of the main points of entry for aid into Gaza, where long queues of trucks with aid are waiting for Israeli approval to cross.\nWestern countries and aid groups have criticised Israel over its inspection process, blamed for slowing down the entry of much-needed help.\nThe war in Gaza began when Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli officials.\nMore than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory air strikes and its continuing ground offensive, the Hamas-run health ministry says.\nEarlier, Mr Guterres met UN humanitarian aid workers in el-Arish, the Egyptian city closest to Gaza, where much of the international relief for the enclave is delivered and stockpiled. He later visited a hospital where injured Palestinians are being treated.\nHis trip comes as Israel plans to launch a ground operation in Rafah. More than half of Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians are sheltering in the southern city, where Israel says Hamas leaders are hiding and Hamas battalions still operate.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defied international criticism of the planned offensive, saying \"no international pressure will stop Israel\" from achieving all of its war aims.",
    "The UN's top court has ordered Israel to enable the unhindered flow of aid into Gaza in order to avert a famine.\nIn a unanimous decision, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said Israel had to act \"without delay\" to allow the \"provision... of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance\".\nThis follows warnings that famine could hit Gaza within weeks.\nIsrael has called allegations it is blocking aid \"wholly unfounded\".\nGiving its response to the court order, the Israeli foreign ministry said it was continuing \"to promote new initiatives, and to expand existing ones\" to allow a continuous flow of aid into Gaza \"by land, air and sea\", working with the UN and others.\nIt said that Hamas was to blame for the situation in Gaza and for starting the war.\nThe latest ruling by the court in The Hague comes after South Africa asked it to bolster an order issued to Israel in January to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza.\nSouth Africa said it had an obligation to act to prevent genocide as a signatory of the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention.\nThe country has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza and its governing African National Congress (ANC) has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.\nAlthough orders issued by the ICJ are legally binding, the court lacks the power to enforce them. The UN Security Council is the only UN body which can introduce measures to try to ensure compliance.\nThe ICJ's ruling comes after a report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Global Initiative , which is run by the World Food Programme and others, was published last week - warning that a \"catastrophic\" situation was developing in Gaza.\nIt said that all of the 2.2 million people in Gaza were \"facing high levels of acute food insecurity\" and that famine was projected to hit the north of the territory before the end of May.\nFamine occurs when a country has such a severe food shortage that its population faces acute undernourishment, starvation, or death.\nIn its ruling, the ICJ said Gaza was \"no longer facing only a risk of famine\" but \"famine is setting in\" and that, according to UN observers, 31 people, including 27 children, had already died of malnutrition and dehydration.\nThe court also noted comments by Volker T\u00c3\u00bcrk, the UN's high commissioner for human rights, who said last week that the \"situation of hunger, starvation and famine\" was \"a result of Israel's extensive restrictions on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid and commercial goods, displacement of most of the population, as well as the destruction of crucial civilian infrastructure\".\nMr T\u00c3\u00bcrk recently told the BBC that there was a \"plausible\" case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza and that, if intent was proven, this would amount to a war crime.\nThe ICJ said Israel had to \"take all necessary and effective measures to ensure, without delay, in full co-operation with the United Nations, the unhindered provision at scale... of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance\".\nThe aid most needed included food, water, electricity, fuel, shelter and clothing as well as hygiene products and medical supplies, it said.\nIn recent months long queues of aid trucks have repeatedly formed as they wait to enter Gaza from Egypt, and accusations have been levelled at Israel that it is subjecting the deliveries to complex and arbitrary checks.\nIsrael has also said that Hamas takes much of the aid that enters Gaza and accused the UN of failing to distribute what is left to the civilian population.\nThe current conflict began after the 7 October attack, which saw Hamas-led gunmen storm across the border into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 others hostage.\nOf those taken, about 130 remain unaccounted for, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead.\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry says Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 32,623 people. Earlier this month, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said that, of those killed, more than 25,000 were women and children.\nIsrael has vowed to press on with its mission to eliminate Hamas, despite the UN Security Council passing a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire earlier this week.\nIsrael's military recently launched another raid on al-Shifa hospital - Gaza's biggest - where thousands of displaced people are sheltering.\nAl-Amal hospital in southern Gaza was taken out of service earlier this week after Israeli troops forced medics and patients to evacuate, the Palestine Red Crescent Society reported.\nThere have also been repeated Israeli air strikes on what it says are Hamas targets throughout Gaza.\nIsrael has threatened to launch an offensive in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering.",
    "As I arrived in Downing Street to interview the prime minister earlier this week, his aides were whispering about some mysterious last minute \"artwork\" that was yet to appear.\nWhen Rishi Sunak walked into the room, a hitherto blank screen flashed with a multi-coloured line chart pointing downwards with the words \"Inflation. Halved\".\nMr Sunak and his team are going to great effort to project a turnaround in the UK economy. In a wide-ranging interview on the economy, he spoke of turning points and bounceback, and insisted  it's \"not just me\" who saw green shoots of recovery up and down the country.\n\"Wages are up. Energy bills are falling. Pensions are going up. Tax cuts are now already happening and benefiting people. That all just gives me the confidence that the future is brighter,\" he said.\n\"2024 will prove to be a bounce back year for the UK economy.\"\nWhile his political position means the PM has no other choice than to say he expects a thumping economic recovery, I was somewhat taken aback by the extent of his sunny optimism.\nThree key dates\nThis buoyancy comes against a backdrop of consistently dire opinion polls for both Mr Sunak and the Conservative party, and the rapidly approaching local elections in England on 2 May.\nBut the prime minister's eyes are focused on three other dates that month.\nOn the 10 May, the recession could be officially declared over, when GDP figures for January to March are expected to show that the economy is growing again.\nOn 22 May, we will get inflation figures for April, with the headline rate forecast to be below the Bank of England's 2% target for the first time in three years.\nBut it is the next interest rate decision on 9 May that may explain Mr Sunak's sanguineness.\nUp until this week, the expectation has been that an interest rate cut would come in the summer or later, when the Bank was absolutely sure that the inflation shock had been defeated.\nBut Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey went further in his interview with me on behalf of UK broadcasters on Thursday after rates were left unchanged at 5.25%, their highest for 16 years.\nWhen I asked him whey he had not cut rates yet, he replied: \"We're on the way.\"\nHe said that the Bank did not have to wait until after inflation was below 2% to cut. He also said that market predictions of two or three cuts were \"reasonable\".\nSo a cut is now in play for May.\nBoth the PM and the chancellor have been at pains not to actually tell the independent Bank of England what to do. That said, one can only imagine the rain dances being done in Downing Street for a series of rate cuts before a general election.\n'It's not better... it's stopped getting worse'\nYet when I was near Crewe earlier this week and asked I asked businesses and families whether they were seeing a turnaround or even stabilisation in the cost of living crisis, I got a uniformly negative response.\nShaine Ashley Tench, who runs A Star Taxis, said a recent quote to insure his fleet was in the tens of thousands. \"We can't just put that onto the customers' price, because we need to be an affordable, reliable taxi company in this area,\" he said.\nA second-hand car salesman told me some customers were telling him they could afford a car but were put off buying because of insurance costs. At the Wheelock Hall farm shop, a man told me the standing charge on his energy bills had gone up and his car insurance had doubled. \"It's getting worse,\" he said.\nA nurse conceded that her gas and electric prices had stopped rising, but said: \"It's not getting better, it's just stopped getting worse.\" She then listed all the other bills that will go up in April - mobile phone, broadband, water and council tax.\nThe psychology of personal finances is very interesting. Can people really feel a declining inflation rate as good news or is that outweighed by prices being much higher than they were? And would a household feel it more if they had smaller bills but with above-inflation price rises, or if they saw a fall in their large energy bill?\nIn Downing Street, they point out that members of the public on radio phone-ins or TV are bound to find some areas where they feel personal finance pain.\nBut the way this has been measured across the economy for decades has been by consumer confidence numbers. The GfK measure of overall consumer confidence is still in clear negative territory, but in new numbers for March, people's perceptions of their own personal finances over the next 12 months went positive for the first time since January 2022.\nIt is a chart being followed very carefully by the prime minister.\nCautious opposition\nFor the Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the situation is clear. The economic situation is grim in absolute and relative terms, and whoever wins the upcoming election will inherit the worst overall set of circumstances since World War Two.\nIn a lecture this week, she firmly committed to get debt falling in five years' time, taking on the same self imposed straitjacket tha",
    "An infant health expert has told jurors it is \"exceedingly unlikely\" that Constance Marten and Mark Gordon's baby died of hypothermia.\nProfessor Peter Fleming was called by the defence to give evidence at the couple's trial for the gross negligence manslaughter of their newborn Victoria.\nHer body was found in a bag at an allotment in Brighton last March after a weeks-long search for the family.\nThe couple deny manslaughter and a number of other charges.\nProf Fleming - professor of infant health and developmental physiology at the University of Bristol - told the Old Bailey: \"I have seen no evidence of hypothermia as a cause of death.\n\"The description of how she was being cared for would make hypothermia exceedingly unlikely.\"\nProf Fleming later agreed that the account of how the baby was being cared for had been given to him by Ms Marten.\nThe expert witness said he had studied babies in Mongolia who safely slept in their mother's clothing when the \"room temperature was commonly zero or below zero\".\nJudge Mark Lucraft asked: \"Presumably they were wearing traditional Mongolian clothing?\" Prof Fleming replied: \"Correct.\"\nMs Marten has previously told jurors Victoria died on 9 January, but prosecutors allege she died weeks later.\nProf Fleming said a measurement of Victoria's foot length suggested she was not born prematurely and was about two to three weeks old when she died.\nHe added he could not confirm Victoria was eight weeks old when she died.\nProf Fleming said: \"All the pointers suggest to me that she was much younger. The best fit is that she was two or three weeks.\"\nMs Marten's account of the death is that she fell asleep sitting up in a tent and \"keeled over\", waking up to find Victoria dead.\nProf Fleming said he had seen two cases in his career in which a breastfeeding mother had been sitting up, and fell asleep over the baby who died.\nProsecutor Tom Little KC asked the witness what his response would have been had Ms Marten told him she was going to be sleeping in a tent in temperatures between 4 and 10 degrees, with only \"a baby grow and a vest\".\nProf Fleming replied: \"I would say it would be inadvisable, but if you have to then keep your baby inside your coat.\"\nAsked by the prosecutor what he thought of the \u00c2\u00a340 Argos tent the couple purchased to stay in, Prof Fleming said it would not be \"ideal\" accommodation.\nThe jury has heard that the couple kept Victoria's body in a shopping bag for days or even weeks after her death.\nThe judge asked Prof Fleming a question posed by the jury about what the optimum time after death to carry out a post-mortem examination would be.\n\"The sooner the better,\" Prof Fleming said. \"Within 24 hours ideally.\"\nBoth defendants deny manslaughter by gross negligence, perverting the course of justice, concealing the birth of a child, child cruelty, and causing or allowing the death of a child.\nThe trial continues.",
    "Taylor's Swift's father will not be charged over accusations he assaulted a paparazzo in Australia.\nBen McDonald, 51, told police Scott Swift, 72, struck him in the face on a Sydney wharf on 27 February. He did not need medical help.\nA spokesperson for Swift at the time said two people had been behaving aggressively towards the megastar.\nAfter a month-long investigation, New South Wales police on Tuesday said no further action would be taken.\nThe confrontation happened after Mr Swift and his daughter disembarked from a yacht, in the hours after her final Eras Tour show in Sydney.\nA video published by Australian media shows the singer, who is concealed beneath an umbrella, walking with her father and security guards along Neutral Bay Wharf at about 02:30 local time (15:30 GMT).\nCameras flash before two voices - reported to be a photographer and a guard - accuse each other of touching umbrellas. It is unclear whether the footage captures the alleged incident.\nMr McDonald previously told the BBC Swift was already inside a car when Mr Swift \"charged in\" and attacked him without provocation.\n\"I've been doing this for 23 years and I haven't been in a situation where someone's hit me in the chops,\" he said.\nHowever, the singer's representative said: \"Two individuals were aggressively pushing their way towards Taylor, grabbing at her security personnel, and threatening to throw a female staff member into the water.\"\nKnown as \"Papa Swift\" by fans of the pop icon, Mr Swift has been accompanying his daughter on her global Eras Tour and left the country shortly after the incident.",
    "Maryland's governor has provided early details of his plan to clean up wreckage after a cargo ship hit a major bridge Baltimore, killing six.\nTo help, the Biden administration has approved $60m (\u00c2\u00a347m) in emergency funds that Maryland had requested.\nGovernor Wes Moore outlined how they intended to clear debris, remove the ship, extract bridge pieces and rebuild it.\n\"We have a very long road ahead of us,\" he said.\nSpeaking alongside lawmakers at a news conference on Thursday, Mr Moore outlined plans for each stage of the process, which he said will pose several challenges.\nFor one, the governor said, the cargo vessel that hit the Francis Scott Key Bridge - called the Dali - is nearly as long as the Eiffel Tower.\nHe contrasted the situation to the 2021 incident in which it took five weeks to remove a cargo ship that became stuck in the Suez Canal. The difference here, the governor said, is that the Key Bridge is on top of the vessel.\n\"We're talking 3,000 to 4,000 tons of steel that's sitting on that ship,\" Mr Moore said.\nHe added that the rivers' waters were dark, and the debris in the water so dense, that divers could not see more than one or two feet in front of them.\n\"So most of the operation, they simply feel,\" he said. \"These divers have been methodical, they've been disciplined, they've been courageous, diving in darkness with objects all around them.\"\nThe state has requested a host of resources to help with the clean-up process.\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers is covering the cost of clearing the channel and has 32 staff members and 38 US Navy contractors on the ground, said Maryland's Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.\nHe added that a 1,000-ton (907-tonne) crane - the largest on the US eastern seaboard - would arrive around 0:00 EST (04:00 GMT) on Friday to help remove debris. A 400 ton crane would then come on Saturday to further aid in clearing the debris.\nIn the meantime, those involved in the clean-up process must figure out how to cut debris from the bridge into pieces so they can be lifted by the crane, said Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath of the US Coast Guard.\nAuthorities have also deployed 2,400 feet of water containment booms to protect against hazardous material from the boat, Mr Moore said.\nThe Dali was carrying thousands of cargo containers on board, including 56 that were holding hazardous materials, officials have said. That included items like lithium batteries and perfume, according to the governor.\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, said 764 tonnes of mostly corrosive and flammable materials were identified on the boat.\nMr Moore said the state is also planning to provide economic support to workers whose jobs have been affected by the crash - around 8,000 people, according to the state government.\nThe recovery cost will not be cheap, according to analysts, but the state is eligible for more federal emergency relief funds in addition to the $60m it has already received, Mr Van Hollen said.\nHe said that money would help cover the \"lion's share of reconstructing the bridge\".\nMr Van Hollen said he would introduce legislation to cover the remainder of the recovery costs. President Joe Biden has previously said the federal government should foot the bill to rebuild the bridge.\nDuring Thursday's news conference, Mr Moore and others stressed the importance of fixing the structure as soon as possible.\nIts long-term closure could pose a threat to global supply chains, experts have said.\n\"That's our number one priority, is to reopen the port of Baltimore as fast as we can - and safely,\" Mr Gilreath said.",
    "Nigerian pupils taken by gunmen in a mass abduction in the north-western town of Kuriga earlier this month have been freed \"unharmed\", officials say.\nKaduna state governor Uba Sani said they had been rescued thanks to the courage of the security forces.\nThe school authorities had said more than 280 children were taken, but the army said 137 hostages had been freed.\nIt said the operation took place in the early hours of Sunday morning, days before a ransom deadline.\nOfficials have not yet commented on the discrepancy in numbers.\nIn previous cases, hostages have been able to flee from their captors as they trek for days to forest hideouts.\nA top government official, who asked not to be named, has told BBC Hausa that one of the teachers taken from Kuriga died in captivity. The group was held for 17 days in total.\nKidnap gangs, known as bandits, have seized thousands of people in recent years, especially in the north-west.\nSix mass abductions this month have rocked parts of northern Nigeria, despite an overall fall in the number of such attacks over the past year.\nThose kidnapped are usually freed after a ransom is paid.\nThe kidnappers had demanded $690,000 (\u00c2\u00a3548,000) for the release of the Kuriga children aged between eight and 15. The government had said it would not pay any ransom.\n\"This is indeed a day of joy,\" Governor Sani said in a statement in which he praised Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu for ensuring that the abducted schoolchildren had been \"released unharmed\".\nThe president, who welcomed the news in a tweet , said it showed the importance of the government and state authorities collaborating \"especially on matters of security\".\nMilitary spokesman Maj Gen Edward Buba said 76 girls and 61 boys had been rescued from Zamfara state, which borders Kaduna to the north-west.\nThe military has also released photos of some of the children, showing them sitting in buses looking dusty and exhausted.\nA security source told Reuters news agency the students had been freed in a forest and were being taken to Kaduna for medical tests before being allowed to see their families.\nThe mass abduction occurred on the morning of 7 March during assembly in a compound housing a junior and senior school.\nAccording to witnesses, the pupils were in the assembly ground around 08:30 (07:30 GMT) when dozens of gunmen on motorcycles rode in, eventually taking away 187 students from a secondary school and 125 from the local primary school. It is not clear how many teachers were abducted. Twenty-five students later returned.\nOne pupil, believed to be 14-years-old, died after being shot by the gunmen.\nMost of the kidnaps in north-west Nigeria are believed to be the work of criminal gangs trying to make money from ransoms.\nIn an attempt to curb Nigeria's spiralling and lucrative kidnapping industry, a controversial law that made it a crime to make ransom payments was passed in 2022. It carries a jail sentence of at least 15 years, however no-one has ever been arrested.\nEarlier this year, the family of a group of sisters kidnapped in the capital, Abuja, denied a police statement that the security forces had rescued the girls, saying that they had no choice but to pay the ransom .\nThere was global outrage when Islamist militants from the Boko Haram group seized nearly 300 girls in Nigeria's north-eastern town of Chibok in 2014.\nMost of the victims have either been freed or escaped since then, but dozens remain unaccounted for.\nOn Saturday, the army said it had rescued 17 students and a woman kidnapped just days after the Kuriga attack from a school in Sokoto, also in the north-west.\nYou may also be interested in:",

    "There are always questions after any attack as to why it was not stopped or detected. But the Moscow attack raises particularly difficult issues for Vladimir Putin at a time of international tension and mistrust. And much of that comes because of a warning from Washington.\nThe 7 March warning from the US to its own citizens was unusually specific. It talked of reports that \"extremists\" had \"imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow\" and specifically mentioned concerts. It advised Americans in the city to avoid large gatherings over the coming 48 hours.\nThe timing may not quite match, but other details do tally closely with events on 22 March. It seems clear Washington had some kind of intelligence and that it related to Islamic State (IS) - the group that has issued a statement saying it was behind the Moscow attack.\nAs well as the public warning to its own citizens, the US also said it had communicated with the Russian government directly.\n\"The US government also shared this information with Russian authorities in accordance with its long-standing 'duty to warn' policy,\" a US official said in a statement after the attack.\nThere are channels through which intelligence is shared between countries - even those that are not allies - especially when it relates to possible attacks on civilians.\nBut the problem is that Moscow dismissed the warnings.\nThree days before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the board of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), whose job is to defend the country. The top priority, he told the assembled leaders of the security service, was to support what he called the special military operation - the official phrase for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nHe claimed that Ukraine had switched to what he called \"terrorist tactics\". He also spoke directly to what he said were \"provocative statements\" from the West about potential attacks within Russia. He said the warnings \"resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilise our society\".\nThat suggests that the mistrust between the US and Russia meant Moscow may not have wanted to listen and instead saw the warnings as part of an attempt to threaten Russia, linked to the Ukraine conflict.\nWe do not yet know the exact nature of the information the US possessed or passed or how clear it was. Intelligence can often be vague and hard to act on.\nBut the US has a vast intelligence-gathering machine and watches IS closely. The branch suspected of the Moscow attack was also linked to one on US forces and civilians at Kabul airport in August 2021, as well as more recent deadly bombings in Iraq.\nBut if the intelligence that was shared with Russia was credible and specific about IS, then the FSB and Mr Putin might appear to be on the back foot about why they did not take it more seriously.\nAnd if so, it may be easier for Moscow to relate the attack in some way to Ukraine in order to deflect blame and also build support for Russia's actions there, rather than acknowledge what they might have missed.",
    "There is a new running joke in Hong Kong: locals mock their city for losing its status as the darling of global capital. As one joked, it is the newest Unesco world heritage site.\nA tough security law - Article 23 - that came into effect over the weekend has only renewed the underlying concerns.\nAuthorities say it will protect the city and ensure stability, while critics are alarmed it will silence all dissent with its closed-door trials and life sentences for broadly-defined offences - from insurrection to treason.\nIt comes at a time when Beijing's iron grip and US-China tensions were already driving away foreign investors who now have an \"anywhere but China\" policy, says Mr Chan, a real estate surveyor, who did not wish to disclose his full name.\n\"Hong Kong was seen as distinct from China so investors could still invest here - not anymore now,\" he says.\nArticle 23 and after\nThe emphasis on national security and the danger posed by \"foreign forces\" - a running theme in the legislation and in Beijing's recent policies - raises the stakes for foreign capital and businesses operating in the city.\n\"The business has been awful in the past two years and there was no major deal at all,\" says Mr Tse, who works for a Chinese state-owned bank. He said his company fired 10% of their staff in June and another 5% just this past week. \"No one knows when it will be their turn.\"\nWhile it is too early to evaluate the risks of Article 23 to businesses, it could lead to higher compliance costs because of its \"broad wording\" and the \"severe consequences of a breach\", says Johannes Hack, the president of the German Chamber of Commerce.\nThe Hong Kong government told the BBC in a statement that Article 23 will make the city \"advance from stability to prosperity\", and will not affect \"normal\" businesses. It also said it is \"outrageous\" to single out Hong Kong when other countries have security laws too.\nHong Kong's Article 23, which expands on national security legislation imposed by China in 2020, comes at a time when the city's administration is trying to reassure the world that it's still a financial dynamo.\nThe Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce argued it \"will make Hong Kong a safer destination for local and foreign businesses and professionals operating\" in the city, while Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee had dismissed as \"ridiculous\" the notion that the administration only cared about national security, calling such concerns a form of \"soft resistance\".\nHong Kong's economy has been reeling from Beijing's crackdown since the pro-democracy protests in 2019 and a harsh zero-Covid policy. Rentals for commercial and retail spaces have fallen, leaving office buildings and shopfronts vacant. There are fewer tourists - last year's arrivals were only 60% of the pre-pandemic figure.\nThe value of the Hang Seng index - Hong Kong's crown jewel - has fallen by more than 40% since 2019. India overtook the city in January to become the world's fourth-largest stock market. Singapore has emerged as a stiff regional rival for finance. Global banks have been laying off people focused on Hong Kong and China, pointing to sluggish growth and plummeting investor confidence.\nAn exodus of capital and people has followed, with the former head of Morgan Stanley Asia declaring recently in a newspaper column that \"Hong Kong is over\". Veteran investor Lam Yat-ming wrote in an economic magazine that investors should \"cherish their lives and distance themselves from Hong Kong stocks\".\n\"Outside perception of Hong Kong\" has changed, Mr Hack says.\n\"While the city is still distinctly different from the mainland, the focus on security may increasingly blur the distinction in people's minds.\"\nOne country, two systems\nThe former British colony has been run under the principle of \"one country, two systems\" since its return to China in 1997. Beijing promised that Hong Kong would enjoy civil liberties for half a century.\nBut critics say it has reneged on the deal, crushing pro-democracy protests and imposing a national security law (NSL) in 2020 under which more than 260 people, including former lawmakers, have been arrested. Authorities defend it, saying it marked the transition from \"chaos to governance\".\nA local security law, outlined in the city's mini constitution, was always on the cards. The first attempt in 2003 failed after half a million people took to the streets against it. This time, Article 23 was passed less than two weeks after it was tabled.\nUnder Xi Jinping, China attaches \"absolute importance\" to national security - and Hong Kong's status as a free society and an international gateway comes second, says Kenneth Chan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University.\nHe says the arrest of Jimmy Lai, the former media mogul who has been charged under the NSL, was an \"awakening for the international community\".\n\"The national security law has no limits.

    "Investigators have warned it will take time to unravel what went wrong when the Dali container ship slammed into a concrete column holding up the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing its catastrophic collapse.\nThe 1.5 mile (2.4km)-long bridge fell upon impact, plunging eight construction workers into the water. Two were rescued on the day, the bodies of another two were recovered on Wednesday and the search continues for the other four, all presumed dead.\nAboard the ship were 764 tons of hazardous material, including sheen - used in paint - some of which has leaked into the Patapsco River.\nThe ship lost power just before the collision and recovery of the data recorder on Wednesday will shed more light on why the ship malfunctioned. The captain of the ship, the ship's mate and two engineers have been interviewed by investigators.\nThis inquiry is likely to focus on two main areas - what was behind the catastrophic loss of power and whether the bridge should have better withstood the impact.\nWhy the power loss\nVideo from the incident shows the Dali losing power in the moments before the collision. A power cut may have caused the ship's crew to lose control of its steering, ultimately making them unable to control its trajectory.\nInvestigators are looking at whether contaminated fuel played a role in the ship losing power, the boss of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) told reporters. Jennifer Homendy said they had collected a sample of the ship's fuel to examine it.\nImpure fuel can create problems with a ship's engines and power generation.\n\"The vessel went dead, no steering power and no electronics,\" an officer told Fox News. \"One of the engines coughed and then stopped. The smell of burned fuel was everywhere in the engine room and it was pitch black.\"\nAudio from the ship's \"black box\" recorder reveals the pilot of the ship had radioed for tugboat help after reporting the power loss, and had warned dispatchers that the ship was headed towards the bridge.\nThe crew's efforts to mitigate the impact, including steering hard to port and dropping the anchor, proved fruitless. Less than three minutes later, the ship struck the bridge.\nThe Dali, measuring about three American football fields in length and piled high with shipping containers, was moving at about 8 knots (9mph or 14.8 km/h).\n\"This is a really big ship. And the momentum and energy associated with that ship moving even at just a couple of kilometres an hour is tremendous,\" said Sanjay Raja Arwade, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\nA bridge from last century\nAt a press conference on Wednesday, Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the Key Bridge was \"simply not made to withstand a direct impact on a critical support pier from a vessel that weighs about 200 million lb (90,700 tonnes)\".\nThe Key Bridge was completed in 1977. At the time, the vessels it would have been designed to allow to pass under were much smaller than today's behemoths, including the 95,000 gross-tonne Dali.\n\"The vessels that were crossing Baltimore Harbour back then - they don't even compare,\" said Norma Jean Mattei, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\"Design lifetimes are so long - over 100 years sometimes - that the demands on the structure can change in ways that are hard to foresee at the time of design and construction,\" said Prof Arwade.\nMs Homendy of the NTSB said the bridge was in satisfactory condition but it did not have redundancies, meaning if a part of the bridge collapses then the whole bridge could collapse.\nThis is not the preferred method for building a bridge today, she said. Of the 615,000 bridges in the US, less than 3% are built this way.\nProf Arwade said designing redundancy into the columns holding up a long span bridge would be \"exceedingly difficult to impossible\".\nThe NTSB is looking into how much the support piers were protected, if at all. Experts told The Conversation that it appears \"dolphins\" - protective barriers - were installed near the Francis Scott Key Bridge but did not prevent the vessel taking down the bridge.\nIt also appears the bridge did not have \"fenders\" - an added layer of protection around a bridge pier - that could have absorbed some of the impact.\nMs Mattei said that mitigating risk is about analysing probabilities in choosing where to spend money. Ultimately, authorities may have judged that the likelihood of a massive ship hitting one of the bridge's supporting columns was too low to justify reinforcing them. \"We have limited dollars to invest,\" she said.\nA salvage firm that helped contain the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 off the Gulf of Mexico - the largest in history - is now heading to Baltimore to begin recovery efforts.\nResolve Marine will be re-floating and removing the Dali ship, kickstarting efforts to restore the waterway for shipping.\nFollowing the collapse, bridge owners around the world will be evaluating how to ensure a similar catastr",

    "Banning disposable vapes will not be \"effective\", the boss of the UK's largest tobacco firm has told the BBC.\nTadeu Marroco, chief executive of British American Tobacco (BAT), also said raising the smoking age would have \"non-intended consequences\".\nThe government plans to outlaw disposable vapes next April as part of the \"biggest public health measure in decades\".\nBAT is the UK's third-largest vape seller.\nSales of disposable vapes - which give a few hundred puffs of nicotine-containing liquid before being thrown away - have skyrocketed in recent years in Britain. It is estimated hundreds of millions are now sold every year, many of them illegal.\nLast week the government published the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which will ban the sale of tobacco to anyone born from 2009 onwards, and bring in on-the-spot fines for retailers caught selling to under-18s.\nBut Mr Marroco said such a ban had not worked overseas. \"In other countries this hasn't been effective,\" he said. \"In Australia they have banned the whole category, and the amount teenagers use in the illegal market is very high. The same is happening in Brazil,\" he added.\nHowever, campaigners believe otherwise. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the anti-smoking charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said, \"The ban on disposables can be made to work but it requires tough enforcement not just in shops but at the border to prevent illegal imports.\"\nAs one of the biggest publicly-listed companies in the UK, BAT is third in the disposable vape sector behind market leaders Chinese firms SKE and iMiracle, which make Elfbar and Lost Mary.\nMr Marroco agreed that tougher penalties are needed. He said proposed on-the-spot fines of \u00c2\u00a3100 were \"not enough\", calling the French proposal of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100,000 (\u00c2\u00a386,000)\"a proper fine\".\nBut he warned of \"non-intended consequences\" for retail and law enforcement from the government's plan to keep raising the smoking age every year, so that people born in or after 2009 will never legally be able to buy tobacco.\n\"We need to tackle first of all the underage vapour use, we need to have a retail licence as we do for alcohol,\" he said, and repeated the company's calls for a ban on flavours which might appeal to children such as sweets and soft drinks.\n\"There is no doubt that the UK is being looked at by a number of countries around the world. That's why it's so important to get it right here,\" he said.\nAsked whether BAT was only advocating policies which aligned with its commercial interests, the chief executive stated: \"This is an industry which has been under a lot of scrutiny on how we reduce the health impact of our products... this is the first time that we have the technology to do that.\"\nMr Marroco defended the company's use of sponsorship as \"predominantly for adults\" - it hands out free samples to promote its oral nicotine pouch products. \"We are very cautious about that,\" he said.\nBAT also sponsors Formula One but Mr Marroco said the company's controls were \"robust enough\" to stop teenagers being encouraged to buy nicotine pouches.\nHowever, he admitted that the law did not prevent them purchasing them. \"At the moment if you're 14 you can buy nicotine pouches [legally in the UK].

That's why they don't like the government's age of sale legislation, not because it won't work but because it will.\"\nIn a statement the Department for Health and Social Care said smoking was responsible for around 80,000 deaths a year in the UK, costing \u00c2\u00a317bn a year.\n\"The Tobacco and Vapes Bill is the biggest public health measure in decades, protecting future generations from the harms of smoking.\n\"It will save thousands of lives and billions of pounds for our NHS, freeing up new resource which can be spent to improve outcomes across the UK.\"",
    "\"Both my mum and my sister got their pensions at 60; I had no reason to believe I would be any different.\"\nWhen Shelley Leggett was 58 years old she was looking forward to retiring at 60, until a letter arrived in the post that shattered all her plans.\nShe was one of thousands of women born in the 1950s who were told they would have to work six years longer than they expected to get their state pension.\n\"It's just an awful blow, when you think you're at the end of your working life, or almost at the end - to find that in fact instead of two years, you have eight more years to do.\"\nThe Belfast woman joined the campaign group Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) to lobby against the \"unfair way\" changes were made to their pensions.\nThis week, the group won a significant victory when a UK watchdog said women in this age group should receive compensation - not for the years of pension payments they lost out on, but for the failure to communicate with them about the new rules.\nThe Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) found that the government failed to adequately inform women born in the 1950s about the impact of changes on their lives.\n\"I feel we're vindicated,\" Ms Leggett told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme .\n\"Clearly we were discriminated against and we weren't informed in time so we could plan our retirement properly.\"\nBut like other Waspi campaigners, she is very disappointed by the recommended compensation levels.\nBased on sample cases, the PHSO has recommended payments of between \u00c2\u00a31,000 and \u00c2\u00a32,950.\nThat is much less than Waspi had called for, and the PHSO does not have the power to force the government to accept its recommendations.\nMs Leggett described the amounts discussed as \"a drop in the ocean compared to what we've lost\".\n\"Yes of course we feel betrayed,\" she said.\n\"I mean, \u00c2\u00a31,000 to \u00c2\u00a32,000, compared to about \u00c2\u00a350,000 that we've lost over those six years?\"\nThe campaigner and former civil servant had worked since her teenage years - taking part-time jobs after school, before getting her first full-time job at 18.\nLike many women of her age, her opportunities to earn were interrupted by caring responsibilities.\nShe paused work for a number of years when her three children were born and she has also spent several years caring for her elderly mother.\nMs Leggett will celebrate her 68th birthday next week and has now fully retired on her state pension, but she is still helping to care for her mother who is now 92 years old.\nWhen did the rules change?\nFrom 1948 until 2010, the age at which men could receive their state pension (provided they had made enough National Insurance contributions) stood at 65.\nDuring that same period the pension age was lower for women - they could draw their pension once they reached 60.\nIn 1995, legislation was passed to gradually equalise the rules for men and women , aiming that by 2020 everyone would have to wait until their 65th birthday.\nBut in 2011, this process was accelerated, as the government brought its gender equalisation target forward to 2018.\nBut it did not personally inform the thousands of women who were affected by the changes.\n\"I got a letter telling me I had enough contributions for a full state pension.  That was in about 2012 - no mention that the age was going up,\" Ms Leggett recalled.\nA few years later, as she was preparing to retire on her promised full pension, she received another letter informing her that her new pension age was 66.\nShe believes she has missed out on tens of thousands of pounds as a result of the changes and she is not alone.\n\"Some women had their divorce settlements stopped at age 60, so clearly the courts didn't even know that the age was going up to 66,\" she points out.\nThe Waspi campaign was set up in Britain in 2015 and Ms Leggett is one of about seven women who represent its Northern Ireland branch.\nThey took their protest to Westminster a few years ago, where they lobbied Northern Ireland MPs and peers for their support.\nMs Leggett also attended Waspi information events in Belfast's Shankill area and in Strabane, County Tyrone, to warn local women about how their futures could be affected.",

    "An Australian state premier has backed a campaign to return an Instagram-famous magpie to its human carers after it was seized by wildlife authorities.\nThe bird, dubbed Molly, was rescued as a chick by a Queensland couple and formed an unlikely bond with their bull terrier, Peggy.\nMore than two million people follow a \"Peggy and Molly\" profile online.\nQueensland's leader Steven Miles says Molly should be reunited with the family, contradicting state officials.\n\"I think sometimes common sense needs to prevail... and if you look at the story, there is a better outcome possible,\" Mr Miles said on Thursday.\nIn an emotional video, Juliette Wells and Reece Mortensen announced they had \"surrendered\" Molly to Queensland's environment department earlier in the week, because of a \"small group of people constantly complaining\" about the animal being in their care.\n\"We are asking why a wild magpie can't decide for himself where he wants to live and who he wants to spend his time with?\" the couple said in a post online.\nMore than 50,000 fans have signed a petition to reconcile the \"bonded animals\" who have appeared together in videos for four years. One cited Molly's imitations of a dog barking as proof it was \"her family\".\nThe state's Department of Environment, Science and Innovation (Desi) said it acknowledged the \"community interest in Molly\", but warned that magpies were not domestic animals and should only ever be housed temporarily for the purpose of \"rehabilitation\".\n\"The magpie is currently under the care of Desi. Unfortunately, it has been highly habituated to human contact and is not capable of being released back into the wild,\" a spokesperson said.\nMs Wells and Mr Mortensen have signalled they will continue their campaign, arguing that Molly would have faced \"certain death\" had it not been housed.\nAustralian magpies - which can live up to 30 years - are a protected native species and are considered vital to the nation's ecosystem. They are named after their resemblance to the Eurasian magpie, to which they are not actually closely related.",
    "Who wouldn't want a house on the beach? For some on Israel's far-right, desirable beachfront now includes the sands of Gaza.\nJust ask Daniella Weiss, 78, the grandmother of Israel's settler movement, who says she already has a list of 500 families ready to move to Gaza immediately.\n\"I have friends in Tel Aviv,\" she says, \"so they say, 'Don't forget to keep for me a plot near the coast in Gaza,' because it's a beautiful, beautiful coast, beautiful golden sand\".\nShe tells them the plots on the coast are already booked.\nMrs Weiss heads a radical settler organisation called Nachala, or homeland. For decades, she has been kickstarting Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, on Palestinian land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.\nSome in the settler movement have cherished the dream - or pipedream - of returning to Gaza since 2005, when Israel ordered a unilateral pullout, 21 settlements were dismantled and about 9,000 settlers were evacuated by the army. (Reporting from Gaza at the time, I saw many who were literally dragged out.)\nMany settlers saw all this as a betrayal by the state, and a strategic mistake.\nOpinion polls suggest that most Israelis oppose resettling Gaza, and it is not government policy, but since the Hamas attacks on 7 October it is being talked about out loud - by some of the loudest and most extreme voices in Israel's government.\nMrs Weiss proudly shows me a map of the West Bank with pink dots indicating Jewish settlements.  The dots are scattered all over the map, eating away at land where Palestinians hope - or hoped - to build their state.\nThere are about 700,000 Jewish settlers in these areas now and settler numbers are rising fast.\nThe vast majority of the international community considers settlements illegal under international law, including the United Nations Security Council. Israel disputes this.\nWe meet Daniella at her home in the West Bank settlement of Kedumim, where red-roofed houses are spread over hilltops and valleys.  She's in constant motion despite having an arm in plaster.\nHer vision for the future of Gaza - now home to 2.3 million Palestinians, many of them starving - is that it will be Jewish.\n\"Gaza Arabs will not stay in the Gaza Strip,\" she says. \"Who will stay? Jews.\"\nShe claims that Palestinians want to leave Gaza and that other countries should take them in - although in a lengthy interview, she rarely uses the word \"Palestinian\".\n\"The world is wide,\" she says. \"Africa is big. Canada is big. The world will absorb the people of Gaza. How we do it? We encourage it. Palestinians in Gaza, the good ones, will be enabled. I'm not saying forced, I say enabled because they want to go.\"\nThere is no evidence that Palestinians want to leave their homeland - although many may now dream of escaping temporarily, to save their lives. For most Palestinians, there is no way out. The borders are tightly controlled by Israel and Egypt, and no foreign countries have offered refuge.\nI put it to her that her comments sound like a plan for ethnic cleansing. She does not deny it.\n\"You can call it ethnic cleansing. I repeat again, the Arabs do not want, normal Arabs do not want to live in Gaza.  If you want to call it cleansing, if you want to call it apartheid, you choose your definition. I choose the way to protect the state of Israel. \"\nA few days later, Daniella Weiss is selling the idea of a return to Gaza over cake and popcorn at a small gathering, hosted by another settler in their living room.\nShe has a projector, showing a new map of Gaza, complete with settlements, and leaflets entitled \"Go back to Gaza\".\n\"People are asking me what the odds are this will happen?\" she says.\n\"What were the odds back then when I came to these dark mountains and made it into this heaven?\"\nThe handful in attendance seem already convinced. \"I want to go back immediately,\" says Sarah Manella. \"When they call me, I will go back to Gush Katif [the former Israeli settlement bloc in Gaza].\"\nWhat about the people who live there, we ask.\n\"The area is empty now, \"she replies. \"Now you don't need to think where to put the settlement, you only need to come back and put a new settlement.\"\nGaza is far from empty, but much of it has been erased after almost six months of relentless Israeli bombardment.\nIt is the \"greatest open-air graveyard\" in the world, in the words of the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell.\nMore than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, most of them women and children.  The World Health Organization regards the ministry's data as credible.\nFor some in the Israeli cabinet, the Palestinian territory - now drenched in blood - is ripe for resettlement.  That includes Israel's hard-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir - a settler himself.\nIn late January, he made his way through a packed conference hall, slowed by embraces and handshakes.

Additional hubs are expected to open in the coming years.\nNot enough details\nHowever, BBC News has spoken to staff at the existing service who say, just days before the 31 March closure, they have been unable to answer basic questions from patients about the future of their care.\nThey say they still do not have enough details about how the new services will operate or when some provisions will be fully operational in the new clinics.\nThe BBC has also seen emails in which staff at the new services complain about a lack of information. Several sources said they had been asking for months for NHS England to help set up channels of communication between the teams to assist with a smooth handover.\nNHS England says it has organised a meeting between the new and old teams.\nThe BBC understands that meeting only took place weeks before the closure of Gids.\nBBC News has also been given a dossier of internal emails - sent between February last year and this month.\nIn one email, sent earlier this month, current director of Gids Dr Polly Carmichael informed staff about the \"unexpected\" cancellation of children's appointments at endocrinology clinics.\nIn the email, dated 8 March, she said the cancellations could create a \"risk\" to some patients and that the process had been \"poorly managed, as we did not know in advance\".\n\"I know this is upsetting but [I] hope we can contain and support any families who make contact,\" she wrote.\nNHS England told the BBC a decision on whether these appointments would be rescheduled was yet to be taken.\n'Far from an ideal situation'\nIn another email exchange, in November last year, clinicians wrote to Dr Michael Holland, chief executive of the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, to raise concerns that they had \"insufficient information\" for patients. They wrote: \"The situation is now having a significant impact on the safety and well-being of the families we are supporting.\"\nOn the same day, Dr Holland replied: \"Your concerns are extremely important, and these are concerns that [the senior leadership team] share.\"\nHe added: \"We are in dialogue with [NHS England] on these very points as we are extremely worried that we need clarity. It is far from an ideal situation.\"\nOne family told the BBC they were still \"completely in the dark\" about their child's future care, saying they had found out more information from news reports than from the NHS.\nPatients and their families have now received letters explaining that the oversight of their care will transfer from Gids to the new service.\nHowever, many say they still do not have basic information, such as names or contact details of the doctors taking over their children's care.\nInstead, the letters advise that those with urgent concerns or queries should contact their GP, local mental health crisis teams, or Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs).\nContinuity of care\nOne of the most controversial elements of care provided by Gids was the use of puberty blockers - drugs that NHS England said were a way to \"delay\" the physical changes of puberty.\nThe NHS recently said the drugs would no longer be routinely prescribed for gender-distressed children and that more research was needed as there was not enough evidence about whether they were \"safe or effective\".\nHowever, sources say they fear the part of the new service that gives psychological support to children still taking those drugs will not be fully operational when the service transfers across.\nThat includes a team at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which will take over the support of children who are currently approved for puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones.\nJob adverts for senior roles in Nottinghamshire - including a principal clinical psychologist, psychiatrists and specialist nurses - only closed to applicants last week, just days before Gids is due to shut.\nA spokesperson for the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Founda",
    "Presenter and podcaster Jordan North started vaping to try to give up cigarettes. He found himself reliant on both - and wasn't happy. Confused by conflicting reports about the potential harms of vaping, he has been looking at the evidence himself for a BBC Three documentary.\nI hate to admit it, but I started smoking when I was 16.\nI tried so many times to quit - and failed - but found that switching to vapes really helped me cut down.\nBut it soon got to the stage where I was vaping way more in a day than I was smoking the cigs.\nNow I wonder - have I just swapped one bad habit for another?\nThe number of people vaping in Britain has tripled in 10 years , charity Action on Smoking and Health estimates.\nHealth experts largely agree that vapes - or e-cigarettes - are a good way to wean adults off smoking because there are fewer toxins in vapes than in tobacco smoke.\nJordan North: The Truth About Vaping\nJordan North sets out to decide, once and for all, if it's time he quit vaping.\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)\nBut many young people are bypassing cigarettes and going straight to vaping.\nOne survey of 18-24 year-olds who use disposable vapes suggests about half have never smoked cigarettes. I think a lot of them probably think vaping is pretty harmless - just like I did.\nI have a few friends who have never smoked but now vape - and they say they are addicted. That's something that started to concern me too.\nWhat's inside a vape?\nI really wanted to get to the bottom of the effects of vaping on my health - and find out what's actually inside these little plastic things.\nSo I paid a visit to the University of Sunderland, where I got my degree. There I met Dr Stephen Childs, who is doing loads of research on vapes.\nI brought along some legal disposable vapes and he pulled them apart in front of me.\nThe smell of the liquid was incredibly strong. I was a bit afraid to hear what would be inside them, but knew I needed to know.\nDr Childs told me that the vapour inhaled from a vape contains nicotine, which is addictive, as well as a small amount of other chemicals used for flavour enhancement.\nThe e-liquid inside vapes also includes the kinds of additives commonly found in processed foods such as sauces and cake mixes. They are safe to eat, but what happens if you're inhaling them?\n\"There are some short-term studies which suggest that there might be things like inflammation in the lungs caused by inhaling these types of [additives] chemicals,\" Dr Childs tells me.\nIllegal vapes\nIn the UK, disposable vapes have to follow lots of regulations - the nicotine content can't be higher than 2% , which is about 20-40 cigarettes-worth.\nBut when we visited shops selling vapes and looked online, we found examples of illegal ones containing 10 times that amount.\nDr Childs told me that even legal vapes contain thousands of chemicals that aren't listed on the packaging. It's not against the law to do this, but I still felt duped.\nA third of vapes on the market in the UK are likely to be illegal versions, the Chartered Trading Standard Institute estimates.\nBut it can be really hard to tell which ones are compliant by looking at the packaging - and we found dodgy versions for sale in a number of High Street shops.\nHere are some things to look out for:\n'Toxic chemical'\nTo find out more about the illegal market, I visited the Inter Scientific laboratory in Liverpool, which tests thousands of illegal vapes seized from across England.\nOut of a recent sample of 24 vapes that the lab looked at this year, nearly a third contained lead.\nIt's a toxic chemical and the World Health Organization says high levels of exposure in young people can affect brain development.\nI also learned that almost 90% of the samples contained high levels of nickel. This is a metal, found in coins or electrics, and prolonged exposure can be harmful to your health.\nIn addition, lab tests found compounds called carbonyls. When the e-liquid heats up, these break down into chemicals such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. These are potentially carcinogenic substances - in other words, they could cause cancer.\nTo cap it all, about a third of these vapes claimed to be free from nicotine, but weren't.\nWe don't know where these illegal vapes were made - there's no UK authority keeping tabs on how they are being produced.\nRaids\nSo who is in charge here? In England and Wales, Trading Standards - a watchdog for illegal or unfair business dealings - can visit shops and seize illegal vapes. Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own teams.\nI spent a day with Trading Standards officers in Newcastle as they raided shops.\nSome shop owners were crafty and had vapes in a back room, but in other stores they were out on display. The Trading Standards officers seized about 1,000 vapes that day.\nBut the number of businesses actually being prosecuted for selling illegal vapes appears to be very low.\nOur team contacted 100 councils, and 80 responded. They said that about 2,200 businesses ",
    "Struggling to buy toiletries is the \"first sign a family is falling into crisis\", a charity trustee has warned.\nThe Hygiene Bank, which runs projects across the UK, helps people who cannot afford basic essential toiletries.\nA new survey carried out by the charity found that more than three million people in the UK are thought to be experiencing hygiene poverty.\nVolunteers at one of the charity's schemes, in Bromley, south-east London, said a school washed pupils' clothes.\nLorraine Howard, ones of the trustees at The Hygiene Bank, said families felt shame and isolation when they were unable to afford to buy toiletries.\n\"It's often the first sign that a family is falling into crisis when they can't afford these basic essentials,\" she said.\n\"We take feeling clean and having clean clothes for granted, but you can imagine the impact on some of us.\n\"The feelings of shame, the stigma, the self-isolation, the social exclusion, and impact on mental health.\"\nThe charity receives donations from the community, which are sorted by volunteers.\nThey are then sent to local organisations, services, charities and projects to give to the families and individuals they support.\nIn London, the charity runs projects in areas including Bermondsey, Lewisham, Peckham, Waltham Forest, Winchmore Hill, Forest Hill and Sydenham.\nThe charity works with charitable organisations including food banks, mother and baby banks, homeless shelters and refuges, and supplies them with products that do not often get donated.\nEamonn Howard, who volunteers at the Orpington site in Bromley, said: \"One of the local schools that we drop stuff off to has got its own washing machine - they actually wash children's uniform.\n\"Or they'll wash their PE kits so they're clean for the next day - which is quite shocking when you first hear it.\n\"The gratitude, you can't imagine it. Especially with the cleaning products.\"\nA survey published by The Hygiene Bank found that 24% of people thought to be experiencing hygiene poverty were regularly struggling to wash their clothes and 29% had to prioritise food instead.\nLast month, the charity distributed over 20,000kg of products across the UK.\nYou can watch Politics London on BBC One on Sunday at 10:00 GMT or on BBC iPlayer after transmission.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Takeaway food is being cooked in a school's kitchens at weekends and evenings to help raise money.\nCustomers can order Sri Lankan, Thai, Mexican or Spanish food to be delivered from York's Carr Junior School.\nThe eco-friendly School Kitchen scheme was set up to get more use out of the kitchens, while also boosting school funding with a share of the cash.\nDavid Nicholson, School Kitchen boss, said it was a \"fantastic opportunity\" to benefit from an underused resource.\nMr Nicholson, the managing director of the project, said he came up with the idea after becoming \"disillusioned\" with big food companies and their disconnection from local communities.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio York, he added: \"It's a resource which the schools have spent a lot of money on, that they're not getting any benefit from.\n\"Schools have kitchens which they are not using on evenings or weekends, so I thought that was a fantastic opportunity.\n\"If we can partner with schools to use those kitchens, it's a way for us to be in the middle of a community and schools to get extra funding.\"\nAside from giving schools a cash boost, School Kitchen also hopes to offer pupils cooking lessons.\nThe team also wants to plant crops and herbs on disused land at Carr Junior School, so children can learn where food comes from and how to grow it.\nSchool Kitchen added that it was committed to fair employment, with no zero-hour contracts and all employees, from chefs to delivery riders, paid at least the living wage of \u00c2\u00a312 an hour.\nVicki Kerr, head teacher at Carr Junior School, said: \"We are really looking forward to being part of this exciting new venture.\n\"Not only is the food delicious, but it will directly benefit the\u00c2\u00a0school\u00c2\u00a0and the local community.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Jade Skea was a teenager when she first met charismatic street trader Kim Avis. She did not know it would bring her into a decade-long, controlling and abusive relationship with him and land her at the centre of a story that involved a fake death plot, an international manhunt and a high court trial.\nThis is the first time Jade has told her story about how she and others brought Kim Avis to justice.\nFor Jade it began in the early 2000s when Avis had a jewellery stall in the heart of Inverness which she used to visit with friends.\nJade says he was well-known in the town for his charity fundraising - including ambitious swims of Loch Ness - and was regularly featured in the local press.\n\"It was almost like he was a local sort of celebrity,\" she says.\nBy the time she was 18, Jade was regularly seeing Avis, who was in his 40s.\n\"He wasn't like other adults,\" Jade remembers. \"We kind of felt like he was one of us.\"\nAs their relationship got more serious, Avis isolated her from family and friends and moved her into a static caravan outside Inverness, which no-one visited but him.\n\"Looking back now, I know that part of the plan was to just have me cut-off from everything,\" she says.\nWATCH: Dead man running will be on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 on Wednesday 27 March and on the iPlayer\nBefore long, Jade would begin to see the other side of Avis.\n\"He came to visit me one night, and he was just acting quite erratically, and he was upset about something,\" she says.\n\"He got on top of a picnic table that was outside the caravan, and he started howling, and just making bizarre animal noises.\"\nJade says that after this, Avis raped her for the first time.\nAvis would subject Jade to a campaign of physical violence and abuse. He would go on to rape her again at his house known as the \"Wolves' Den\".\n\"I remember just feeling like that was just kind of the end, this was going to be my life forever,\" Jade says.\nIn 2015, after years of violence, Jade decided to take action.\n\"He never thought that I would ever report him to the police,\" she says.\n\"I don't think that he thought that I had that in me. He was probably quite shocked.\"\nAnd Jade wasn't alone.\nThree other women had come forward to tell their stories of how Avis had raped and abused them over decades. Two of them were children at the time of the abuse.\n\"When other people came forward, at that point it's just completely unravelling for him,\" Jade says.\nAvis appeared in court charged with multiple rapes and sexual assaults against four women. He was released on bail and a trial date was set for March 2019.\nThe problem was, he wouldn't be there.\nKim Avis had quickly sold his Wolves' Den property for \u00c2\u00a3245,000, bought a plane ticket and arrived at Monastery Beach, Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.\nThis place, known locally as \"Mortuary Beach\" due to frequent drownings in its waters, would be where Avis would attempt to fake his death.\n\"He had nothing to lose at that point. If he's got nothing to lose, you just don't know what he is capable of, because he is completely unhinged,\" Jade says.\nAvis's eldest son, who was with him in the US, reported him missing but after a three-day search, it became clear the drowning was a hoax and a serial rapist was on the loose.\nPolice documents from the Monterey County Sheriff's Department recorded reported sightings of Avis all over the California coast in the days following his disappearance.\nOne witness described Avis as a \"crazy Scotsman\", another spoke of how the missing man was heading for Montana where he had bought property.\nMonths later, a mysterious man with an unusual accent arrived at a stall selling rocks and gemstones in the mountains near Colorado Springs, about 1,300 miles from where Avis went missing.\nThe man, who said his name was Cameron MacGregor, would spend about $3,000 at the stall, which was run by a woman called Angie.\n\"He was really elusive,\" she says. \"I knew something was wrong.\"\nThe man claimed to be Scottish and sported an unfinished giant wolf tattoo across his back.\nAngie got to know the man better and she says he looked rough around the edges but always had plenty of cash.\n\"He was always throwing money around,\" she says. \"He'd buy everybody food and he might have been buying friends.\"\nHe told Angie he was a US citizen.\n\"I said 'Well let me see your passport,' and he got mad. He drove off for about an hour.\n\"I'm like, 'this is strange, this is really peculiar, he's talking about a witch hunt, something isn't right here'.\"\nAngie no longer believed Cameron MacGregor was who he said he was.\n\"I took a picture of his car licence plates. I had a police friend and I said 'will you run these plates?'\"\nAngie says she then got a call from the US Marshals, a government agency that hunts fugitives across state lines.\n\"They said 'stay away from him, he's dangerous',\" she says.\nThey asked Angie for information on where Avis stayed and where he went.\nThe US Marshals now had various tip-offs, sightings and financial transactions in",
    "A church which supported the asylum claim of the Clapham alkali attacker limited his rights to attend services after a sexual assault conviction, newly released documents reveal.\nAbdul Shokoor Ezedi's body was found in the river Thames in February, ending a police hunt after a mother and her children were attacked in January.\nEzedi won asylum in 2020 after proving his conversion to Christianity.\nHe was given a Muslim funeral and burial in London, the BBC understands.\nThe request for an Islamic burial is believed to have come from friends and family.\nThe documents were issued by the court which handled his application.\nEzedi, 35, arrived in the UK in 2016 from Afghanistan, and was granted asylum after two applications and an appeal.\nA key factor was his June 2018 baptism at Grange Road Baptist Church in Jarrow, South Tyneside, where he had been attending since 2016, according to the court documents.\nThe documents were released after several newspapers and broadcasters, including BBC News, applied for his paperwork from the First Tier Tribunal, which handles immigration and asylum applications.\nLabour's Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the \"disturbing revelations\" raised serious and urgent questions for the Home Office.\nShe called on Home Secretary James Cleverly to explain why Ezedi was not removed from the UK in the two years after his first asylum claim was rejected, given his sexual offence conviction.\n\"We need to know how many other similar cases there might be, whether the Home Office is failing to recognise the urgency of dealing with sex offence cases, and what went so badly wrong in this appalling case,\" Ms Cooper said.\nA letter from Reverend Roy Merrin, former ministry team leader at Grange Road Baptist Church, said Ezedi had \"established a good relationship with the other church members and is always willing to help as required\".\nThe letter, dated 28 August 2018, confirmed Ezedi's baptism and stated: \"Abdul has been ready to share his faith in Christ with non-Christians.\n\"I hope that this information will be of assistance, and I would support his application to remain in this country.\"\nThe letter came eight months after Ezedi's sex offences conviction.\nThe documents also show the car mechanic had argued that his conversion to Christianity was genuine, even though the original judge in his case doubted parts of his story. The tribunal questioned why a person who had been threatened by the Taliban would travel without his parents, who were also under threat.\nEzedi argued that it was his conversion to Christianity and the Taliban's knowledge of this that made him particularly vulnerable, even though he could not prove how the Taliban would know this fact.\nThe original judge said: \"The mass of inconsistencies in all three accounts mount up to paint a wholly unreliable and inconsistent picture and one which as a result must be considered to lack credibility.\"\nThe judge did not believe that if Ezedi had been seriously injured, as he claimed, he would have been mobile enough to escape Afghanistan in a car and lorry as well as periods of walking. His appeal was handled by Collingwood Immigration Services in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.\nThe newly released documents detail how in February 2018, Abdul Ezedi was convicted of sexual assault and exposure. His sentence was suspended and he had to do unpaid work. In the documents he expressed shame for his actions and said he understood the importance of not lying.\nThe papers show that after his conviction, Ezedi had to agree to a safeguarding contract which stipulated that he should be accompanied to services at Grange Road Baptist Church by other males.\n'Pleasant, friendly'\nAlso in the documents bundle was a separate letter in July 2017, pre-dating Ezedi's convictions, which saw him described by a project worker at the Catholic Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle Justice and Peace Refugee Project as a \"pleasant, friendly and co-operative man\".\nIt detailed how he attended the project each week and \"signs for a bag of food\" as well as being given \u00c2\u00a325 in cash each month.\nA spokesperson for the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle said the letter from the project worker was \"issued to assist with support from other agencies and not as part of an asylum claim\".\nThey added: \"The Diocesan Justice and Peace Refugee Project is a charitable venture set up to serve people in severe need, providing, for instance, food parcels donated by individuals or parishes.\n\"Occasionally in cases of hardship it also gives a small donation in cash and supports people with second-hand clothing or shoes.\n\"It is not involved in asylum casework.\"\nIt has also emerged that Ezedi was on medication for depression when he successfully applied for asylum.\n'Dignified burial'\nEzedi's funeral was conducted by a mosque in west London, and he was given a Muslim burial at a cemetery in east London on 11 March, the BBC has learned.\nHe is not thought to have been known to the mosque which buried him.\n\"As a funera",
    "Greater Manchester Police is reassessing its decision not to investigate claims Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner gave false information on official documents.\nIt followed a complaint from a Conservative MP.\nMs Rayner has denied any wrongdoing relating to where she was registered as living after her marriage in 2010.\nTory MP James Daly had asked police to investigate whether she had given false information or broken electoral rules.\nEarlier this month, the police said they had found no evidence any offence had been committed.\nHowever, in a statement a spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police said: \"We have received a complaint regarding our decision not to investigate an allegation and are in the process of reassessing this decision.\n\"The complainant will be updated with the outcome of the reassessment in due course.\"\nMs Rayner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I am confident that I've done absolutely nothing wrong.\"\nIt followed claims made in a book by Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative Party deputy chairman, about Ms Rayner's ex-council house on Vicarage Road in Stockport, Greater Manchester.\nQuestions were then raised about whether the house was her principal residence at the time, a distinction which could have had an impact on how much tax she owed when it was sold.\nMs Rayner, nee Bowen, bought the semi-detached home in 2007, getting a 25% discount under the Right to Buy scheme introduced by former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\nIn September 2010 she married Mark Rayner, who owned a separate house nearby in Lowndes Lane.\nThe Mail on Sunday, which is serialising the book, has reported Ms Rayner was registered as living at Vicarage Road on the electoral roll until she sold the property in 2015.\nBut she appears to have given two different addresses when she re-registered the births of two of her children in 2010 following her marriage to Mr Rayner.\n'Smear'\nIn March 2015, two months before she became an MP, Ms Rayner sold the Vicarage Road property for \u00c2\u00a3127,500, a gain of \u00c2\u00a348,500. The couple separated in 2020.\nJames Daly is the MP for Bury North, while Angela Rayner represents Ashton-Under-Lyne, another Greater Manchester constituency.\nMs Rayner has said she is the victim of a \"smear\" and has accused the Conservatives of trying to \"manufacture a police investigation\".\nShe says has received professional advice that she owes no tax on the sale of her home.\nAsked why she would not put that legal advice into the public domain, Ms Rayner told Today: \"Because that's my personal tax advice. But I'm happy to comply with the necessary authorities that want to see that.\"\nShe said she would hand over the information to the police and HMRC, \"but I'm not going to put out all of my personal details for the last 15 years about my family\".\nIf Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and other senior Tories publish the tax details from the past 15 years she would do the same, she added.\n\"If you show me yours, then I'll show you mine,\" she told Today.",
    "Shop sales saw zero growth in February as wet weather and cost-of-living pressures kept people at home.\nWhile clothing sales increased, this was offset by falling food and fuel sales, according to official figures.\nFebruary's flat sales came after a lacklustre December followed by a strong bounce back in January.\nAlthough food price rises eased in February, people remained under pressure as a result of housing costs and fuel prices.\nEconomists had predicted that sales volumes would fall slightly in February.\nHowever, clothing sales increased as did sales in department stores because shoppers splashed out on the new season's collections.\nThis boost helped to offset a drop in food sales as shoppers stayed away due to poor weather.\nOn the flipside, the weather benefitted online retailers, in particular those selling clothing.\nFebruary was the fourth wettest on record in England, and it was the warmest weather on record for England and Wales, Met Office figures show.\nIn southern England, it was the wettest February on record.\nClimate change means the UK weather is on average getting wetter in the winter and drier in the summer, according to the Met Office, and heavy rainfall could get more frequent and longer if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.\nAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at industry group the British Retail Consortium, said that retailers are increasingly having to manage the effects of climate change, which has created more variability in the weather.\n\"Without action, there is a real risk of food insecurity due to falling global farm yields and increased threats to global supply chains,\" he said.\nAlong with the weather, the economic climate also contributed to a drop in footfall in food shops. Sales in household goods stores also fell, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nHouseholds have been squeezed by a cost-of-living crisis, and economic growth has been sluggish, with the UK in a shallow recession at the end of last year.\nHowever, the pace of general price rises has been slowing, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the UK economy will \"bounce back\" in 2024.\nEconomic research firm Pantheon Macroeconomics predicted that retail sales would \"drag the economy out of recession\" in the first three months of the year.\nFebruary's flat retail sales contrasted with December's drop of 3.2%, and then a strong bounce back in January.\nThe ONS has now revised January's sales figures up from a 3.4% to a 3.6% rise.\nDanni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said it was not a surprise that February's downpours \"kept people off High Streets and tucked up in their dry living rooms\".\n\"After a few tricky months clothing retailers needed a win and those that have toiled to create must-have pieces at a price point that works for their buyer will be feeling a kind of fuzzy relief.\"",
    "Schools fear they are \"stuck\" with leaking roofs and decades-old temporary classrooms, after the final spots to receive rebuilding cash in England were taken by those with dangerous concrete.\nMost of the last places on a scheme to rebuild schools went to those with reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac), which closed schools this year.\nOne union said the government had \"cut corners\" by using the existing scheme.\nThe government says it has invested \u00c2\u00a315bn in school buildings since 2015.\nThe School Rebuilding Programme (SRP) aims to rebuild or refurbish 500 schools in a decade.\nThe first 99 were selected by the Department for Education (DfE) in 2021, having been identified as in the worst condition.\nLocal authorities and school trusts were then invited to nominate schools, in 2022.\nAbout 300 were successful, bringing the total number of schools selected to 403 by December 2022.\nAnd the 797 rejected hoped to be chosen in subsequent selection rounds, as - unlike in previous rounds - the government had not specified how they would be filled.\nBut for many, that hope vanished last month, after the government added a final list of 110 schools.\nAnd 106 of those 110 have been confirmed, in recent months, to have Raac, BBC Verify analysis has found.\nJoseph Leckie Academy, in Walsall, was rejected in 2022.\n\"This school's got everything else wrong with it - but it doesn't have problems with Raac,\" head teacher James Ludlow told BBC News.\nPupils campaigned for its 1930s building to be demolished and replaced in 2005 - but nearly 20 years later, bits of concrete are still crumbling from the sides of the building.\nThe roof still leaks.\nAssemblies have to be livestreamed because the school hall is too small to fit whole year groups inside.\nAnd half of the pupils use a makeshift canteen in a temporary building installed decades ago.\n\"It feels really like we're stuck in a position where there is no avenue for us to secure the funding that we need,\" Mr Ludlow said.\n\"The School Rebuilding Programme was one of the last opportunities for us and we feel like that opportunity is now gone.\"\nNational Education Union general secretary Daniel Kebede said the government had \"shunted Raac into an existing programme that was already inundated with applications\", to \"cut corners\".\n\"The fact that schools are having to compete with each other in terms of which is the most dilapidated or dangerous is simply unacceptable,\" he said.\n\"And for schools with no light at the end of the tunnel, it is simply disgraceful.\"\nMake cutbacks\nBellevue Place Education Trust operations director Richard Crompton thought Whiteknights Primary School, near Reading, would have a strong chance of making it on to the SRP eventually, having also been rejected in 2022.\nAll 420 pupils are taught in temporary buildings, dating back up to 30 years.\nReplacing them would cost \u00c2\u00a34m, which Mr Crompton said was \"unachievable\", with the SRP the \"only opportunity\".\nAnd now it would have to make cutbacks to continue maintaining temporary classrooms \"at the end of their life\".\nScalby School, in Scarborough, N Yorks, is one of only seven of the 106 schools with Raac added to the SRP last month to have applied in 2022, citing asbestos in ageing buildings among its concerns.\nSince being told it had Raac, last year, pupils have been learning off-site and metal ceiling props line the corridors.\nHead teacher Chris Robertson said it was \"about time\" the school was added to the SRP.\n\"Over the past two terms, we've done the best to try and stabilise things and make it normal for students,\" he said.\n\"In no way is this normal.\"\nAsked when the rebuilding work would start, Mr Robertson said: \"They [the Department for Education] have talked to us about the fact that we will be seen as a priority given the significant issues that we've got here.\"\nA National Audit Office report last year estimated 700,000 children were being taught in unsafe or ageing school buildings in England.\nLast month, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan told BBC News that total was based on the number of bids for new buildings submitted by schools and did not necessarily reflect their condition.\nA DfE official has since told BBC News it had completed its programme to identify Raac \"in a matter of months\", had now confirmed how it would pay to remove it, and any future funding or programmes would be determined via a government spending review.\nBridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: \"The Conservatives need to tell schools without Raac but no less deserving of renovation, when they can expect to be rebuilt.\"\nIs your school affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "Cardiff Airport has confirmed it will be losing its only direct flight to Paris.\nIn a statement it said that Eastern Airways was suspending its regular Paris Orly service from the upcoming summer schedule.\nThe route, launched last April, was Eastern's sole service from the Vale of Glamorgan-based facility.\nIt will come to an end on Saturday, 30 March.\nHowever, the airline will continue to use the airport and fly regularly from Cardiff for charter flights, \"as and when required\".\nThe news also means that passengers wishing to travel to Paris will now have to so do by flying via Amsterdam.\nIn January 2023 budget airline Wizz Air also revealed it was ending all its flights in and out of Wales, citing the economic climate as the reason for the decision.\nThe firm had already suspended its winter 2002 flights from Cardiff over running costs.\nLast month the Welsh government-owned airport announced it was continuing to make a loss following Covid.\nIn struggling to attract pre-pandemic levels of business it lost \u00c2\u00a34.5m in the year leading to March 2023.\nMinisters are currently supporting Cardiff Airport through a grant worth \u00c2\u00a342.6m over four years.\nOver time it has received millions in government loans and in 2021 Labour wrote off \u00c2\u00a342.6m it had given the airport, leaving it to repay \u00c2\u00a326.3m by 2045.\nA Cardiff Airport spokesperson added: \"Our team are actively speaking to airlines to provide direct flights between Cardiff and Paris.\n\"We know our customers living in Wales are keen for more choice and great prices.\"",
    "Two leading Cornish cultural attractions have received grants for repairs and maintenance projects.\nA total of \u00c2\u00a3499,000 has gone to the National Maritime Museum Cornwall in Falmouth, largely for replacing its main roof.\nThe Leach Pottery in St Ives has been granted \u00c2\u00a3715,000 to address \"urgent repairs to the roof and windows\" and improve facilities at the site.\nThe funds were described as \"vital\" by the government.\n'Treasured institutions'\nThe National Maritime Museum Cornwall said the funds would be used for repair works to the roof to ensure the building stays watertight, and to improve environmental conditions.\nIt also said it would address corrosion to the structure caused by its proximity to the sea wall.\nRichard Doughty, museum director at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall Trust, said when they were notified of the grant, it was a \"Hallelujah\" moment.\nHe said: \"Our museum explores the role small boats have played in maritime cultures and communities around the British coast. No other museum tells this story.\n\"However, we regularly have more buckets out in our main gallery, than boats. Replacing our main roof has been a top priority for us, for several years.\"\n'Lifeline for organisations'\nHe added the costs had remained \"stubbornly beyond\" their reach and described the award as a \"lifeline for organisations struggling to finance essential infrastructure works\".\n\"We are deeply grateful to have been given the help we need to address this fundamental issue.\"\nThe Leach Pottery said it would also work on accessible lift improvements and has proposed works to improve the site's environmental sustainability.\nGary Topp, Chair of the Bernard Leach Trust, said he was \"delighted to receive the funding\" and it would \"help carry out vital work to protect the Leach Pottery's Grade II historic buildings for future generations to enjoy\".\n\"The Leach Pottery has stood on the same site for more than 100 years and is a vital part of the history of St Ives, Cornwall and the international pottery community,\" said Mr Topp.\n'Vital funding'\nHe said the funding would allow it to develop its learning programme, and provide the working pottery with world-class facilities.\nHe added: \"The whole project will mean better on-site services including an archive and library, expanded shop and new cafe.\"\nArts and Heritage Minister Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay said: \"This vital funding for libraries and museums across the South West will see treasured institutions like the National Maritime Museum Cornwall and Leach Pottery continue to impress visitors from near and far\".\nThe funding has come through the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's Cultural Investment Fund.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

    "Residents of a tower block in Cardiff due to be demolished have said their homes are \"falling apart\".\nTenants of Channel View estate in Grangetown were informed in 2016 they would need to move to new buildings - but their completion dates have been delayed.\nThey have been told it could be another four years before the homes are ready.\nCardiff Council acknowledged the delays and said it would look at what \"improvements can reasonably be made\".\nIt also said that Channel View residents will have \"first priority\" once the new flats are complete.\nBBC Wales spoke to a number residents of the 13-storey, council-owned property, many who expressed concerned about the condition of their flats.\nAt the home of one family with three young children there were patches of black mould on the walls. The walls also had water marks, and the family were using old scarves to mop up water that was coming through the windows.\nKaty Monaghan, who has lived in the flats for 20 years, said the situation made her feel \"miserable\", adding that it is so cold that her hands and feet \"go blue\".\n\"It's really uncomfortable. I would rather anything than be cold all the time - the place is falling apart,\" said Ms Monaghan, who lives on the first floor.\nAndrew Rice, who has been living in the flats for six years, showed a crack in the window on the 9th floor, saying the council \"can't be bothered to fix it\".\nHe added that the boiler should have been replaced, but said the council had not done so because the flat \"is coming down\".\n\"I've told them all of this - it's like talking to yourself,\" he said, adding that draught was another issue, and that he had put tape on the windows.\nNot everyone was unhappy about the situation.\nKeith Fruin has been living in the flats for 40 years, and said: \"Nothing's fantastic, but I'm happy. I've got no complaints about my flat.\"\nLynda Thorne, a councillor in Grangetown, and Cabinet Member for Housing and Communities for Cardiff Council, said she understood tenants' frustrations, describing their experiences as \"awful\".\nA few weeks ago she said she organised a meeting with residents to discuss their concerns, and that 30 residents turned up, of which only three wanted to move.\n\"We want to try and accommodate in every which way - but even moving people out during this housing crisis is difficult and it's not a speedy solution,\" she said.\nA spokesperson for Cardiff Council said that following the Grenfell Tower fire in London in 2017, a review of the council's high-rise residential blocks led to the removal of cladding from five buildings, including Channel View.\n\"While the cladding on these blocks was not the same as that on Grenfell, it no longer met current buildings-safety standards,\" the spokesperson said, adding that a decision was made not to re-clad Channel View, but to redevelop the area with new homes.\n\"Unfortunately, the development of the new buildings have been delayed with the pandemic playing a part,\" they said.",

    "A government-ordered rapid review prompted by the Nottingham attacks has found \"enduring areas of concern\" at a mental health trust.\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) said there were continuing issues over care and patient safety at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.\nIt also said it has had concerns about Rampton Hospital for nearly five years.\nThe review of the trust, which treated triple killer Valdo Calocane, was ordered after the attacks in June.\nHealth Secretary Victoria Atkins called for the review after Calocane was given a hospital order for the killings in January.\nThe CQC has now published two parts of that review - an assessment of patient safety at the trust, and an assessment of progress made at Rampton high-security hospital.\nA third part, on Calocane's care by the trust, will be published in the summer.\nChris Dzikiti, the CQC's director of mental health, said: \"While we found some improvements, our review of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust highlights ongoing concerns around people's care and safety.\n\"We have set out clear recommendations for action the trust needs to take so that services provide safe care and treatment, and to protect patients, families and the public from the risk of harm.\"\nMs Atkins added: \"The Care Quality Commission has found failings in the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's ability to manage demand for services, access to care, staffing, and issues of leadership. This is not acceptable, and action must be taken.\n\"Since I commissioned the review, an improvement director has been appointed, and a plan is being developed with the trust and NHS England to improve services. The trust will now have the highest degree of national oversight.\"\nThe CQC said the rapid review identified three \"enduring areas of concern\" at the trust, which were demand for services and access to care, staffing and leadership.\nThe watchdog has also recommended that Rampton - one of three high-security hospitals in England and Wales - is relicensed for a period of no more than 12 months - rather than the usual five years - during which further assessment activity will continue.\nIt has also told Rampton to stop using employees to \"prop up\" other areas, such as therapy and education staff who were being used to increase nursing numbers.\nOn top of this, it said Rampton should be paired with another high-secure hospital as a \"critical friend\".\nIn five inspections since July 2019, Rampton has not received a rating above \"requires improvement\".\nThe CQC noted that while care at the hospital had improved since previous inspections, gaps and challenges need to be addressed.\nA previously-noted culture of bullying and verbal and/or racist abuse at Rampton had improved, the report said, but had not been eradicated, with two patients reporting that staff had made derogatory comments about their weight or physical health issues.\nHowever, the CQC said it must be accepted that other community mental health services were facing many of the same challenges as the trust.\nNational spotlight\nThe review also examined the wider performance of the trust.\nAreas of concern included the waiting lists of local mental health teams - standing at 1,233 people at the time of the review.\nIt also found the trust's crisis teams did not always respond to people's immediate needs to minimise any discomfort, concern, or distress, and did not always treat people quickly.\n\"Inappropriate\" placements - in which patients are placed far from home - more than doubled from 152 to 420 between 2022 and 2023, the CQC found.\nThe report comes after a series of damning revelations involving the trust.\nIn January, a coroner called for action over the death of Tammy Watkins after she died nearly three months after swallowing a crayon.\nSoon after, more than 30 staff across the trust were suspended over separate allegations of staff misconduct, while Rampton was rated as inadequate following an inspection in June and July.\nIn March, the CQC found examples of staff falsifying records and assaulting patients at the trust, and in the same month, the inquest of patient Steven Parkin found his death at Highbury Hospital was contributed to by neglect, adding he was \"failed at every level\".\nBut the service was put in the national spotlight when it emerged Calocane had been in its care several times .\nHis mental illness began in 2019, a court heard, and he had been detained under the Mental Health Act at a psychiatric unit in Nottingham four times since May 2020.\nOn each occasion, he was discharged - the final time in February 2022, more than a year before the killings.\nResponding to the review, the trust said a number of improvements were already in place, including dozens of extra staff, a full risk assessment on all people waiting for treatment and an upgraded crisis line phone system.\nIfti Majid, the trust's chief executive, said: \"We are committed to providing high quality, effective and safe care to those people ",

We will not promote it.\"\nThe Royal High has invested about \u00c2\u00a31,000 in the detectors, which were wired into the three main toilets in the school at the start of March.\nThey work like smoke detectors, but they pick up chemicals that are present in vape mist.\nIf pupils vape, the alarms go off immediately and a text message alerts staff.\nThey are already working as a deterrent.\nSince being switched on, the school has had \"almost zero activations\" in the bathrooms.\nInstalling the alarms in the toilets has allowed pupils to reclaim a space that was becoming intimidating for younger pupils - and allowed staff to concentrate on other areas.\nMs Walker hopes it will make young people less likely to continue the habit and harm their health.\nShe said: \"They are nicotine-based and unfortunately a lot of the vapes young people get a hold of are on the black market.\n\"They don't have the controlled nicotine levels in them, so they can be very high so we do see young people who are addicted.\n\"As a school we need to support them to give that up the same way we would with smokers.\"\nThe move has made life a bit easier for pupil support teacher Iain Welsh.\nOn one of his regular patrols of the school building, BBC Scotland News sees him catching a group of pupils vaping when they should be in class.\nAfter sending them on their way, he says: \"It's a constant battle. We move them on and they find somewhere else, but we are committed to this to try and break a pretty negative cycle.\n\"The detectors are going to be a game changer.\"\nHe said vaping was a problem which affected pupils between S1 and S6, whereas cigarettes tended to be an issue for those in older years.\nBBC Scotland News contacted Scotland's 32 local authorities to ask about vaping in schools. Not every council could provide the data - but the 10 that did respond gave a snapshot of an escalating problem.\nIn the last five years, at least 770 vapes were confiscated at schools in those areas - which include Aberdeen, Dumfries and Galloway, East Lothian, Stirling and West Dunbartonshire.\nA total of 16 young people were either suspended or expelled.\nPolice were called to schools on eight different vaping-related incidents, and ambulances attended more than a dozen times.\nThere were far fewer incidents involving cigarettes over the same time period in those council areas.\nThere were just 27 confiscations involving cigarettes, and no pupil was expelled or suspended in relation to cigarettes.\nThe latest Public Health Scotland survey of health behaviour in school-aged children - covering 2022 - reported that more than a third (36%) of 15-year-olds had used an e-cigarette at least once and a quarter were current users.\nPauline Walker said social education teachers at the Royal High School had found that at least 50% had tried or were currently vaping.\nChris Davison, chairman of the Royal High's parent council, said vaping was discussed at nearly every meeting.\n\"A lot of parents are concerned about the health impacts of vaping and the anti-social behaviour element,\" he said.\nMr Davison said there was also an environmental issue with single use vapes, and called the situation a \"national crisis\".\nBack at the school, senior pupils are well aware of the problem.\nSixth year student Klara said vaping was now \"normalised\".\nShe said: \"Whether it's social gatherings or out and about, it's peer pressure, it's the new thing and it has become a habit.\"\nMelissa said: \"The fun colours and flavours make it more fun and less dangerous.\"\nAoife added: \"I have seen on Snapchat, other people reposting things where people are giving out vapes - and some shops don't check for ID.  Those places get known and everyone goes there.\"\nShe said she was glad the school had taken positive action with the detectors.\n\"I'm older but even I am a bit intimidated when there are big groups of people vaping in the bathrooms, so I can see how it can have an effect for younger years.\"\nThe Scottish government's public health minister Jenni Minto told Holyrood that while smoking rates are at an all-time low, there has recently been a \"notable increase\" in young people using vapes.\nMs Minto was speaking as she confirmed that UK-wide legislation aimed at curbing vaping would apply in Scotland.\nShe said the UK government would shortly bring forward a legislative consent memorandum, which allowed Westminster to pass laws in what were usually devolved areas.\nThe legislation wil",
    "Train drivers at Avanti West Coast will see their fee for an overtime shift increase to \u00c2\u00a3600 following a deal between the company and union Aslef.\nAvanti said it hoped offering more attractive terms to its drivers to work extra shifts would make its services \"more reliable and resilient\".-\nThe company has faced criticism over cancellations, delays and poor service.\nAn Aslef source confirmed that Avanti's offer was accepted by union bosses.\nThe new rest day working agreement is in addition to a driver's salary. Previously the deal involved a flat \u00c2\u00a3125 payment, with an hourly rate paid on top, which could have totalled between \u00c2\u00a3421 and \u00c2\u00a3495 depending on whether a driver worked and eight or 10-hour shift.\nThe deal will be in place until 13 March 2025.\nThe Sunday Times, which first reported the story , suggested some drivers could enjoy a salary of up to \u00c2\u00a3100,000 a year, but neither Aslef nor Avanti were able to confirm these figures.\nLast year Avanti was offered a new contract for the West Coast Main Line, which runs between London Euston and Glasgow Central, with branches to Birmingham, North Wales, Liverpool, Manchester and Edinburgh.\nA spokesperson for Avanti said the deal would \"help ensure our services are more reliable and resilient over time for our customers, while ensuring we continue training our drivers on our brand-new trains\".\nBut the company has faced criticism over its performance, with calls for its contract to be scrapped last week.\nAslef general secretary Mick Whelan said Avanti did not employ enough drivers to offer the service it advertises.\n\"The company approached us with an offer and we accepted,\" he added.\nIn parliament last week, rail minister Huw Merriman said the government would not scrap Avanti's contract to run the West Coast Main Line.\n\"There are issues that will remain regardless of who the operator is, and it is essential to get underneath the bonnet, look at the issues and fix those rather than what's on the side of the car,\" he said.\nThe settlement is separate to the wider dispute between Aslef and most of England's rail companies over train drivers' pay and working conditions.\nSome 14 one-day strikes have been called during the 20-month dispute and members at 16 operators will stage further rolling one-day walk outs between 5 and 8 April, along with a six-day overtime ban.\nIn 2021, the median salary for train drivers was \u00c2\u00a359,189 per year.",

    "If only everything could be reduced to a three-word slogan: \"Take Back Control\" or \"Yes We Can\".\nThe \"Just Stop Oil\" campaign group tells us it's a question of justice and it's simple - \"just\" like that.\nThe fossil fuels industry is struggling to find a simple response. With equal and opposite simplification, it could be \"You'll Need Us\".\nBut the argument set out in the annual business report of Offshore Energies UK is much more complex than that. And in the battle for the survival of the oil and gas industry in British waters, the stakes are high.\nThat yearly report used to be an upsum of industry drilling activity and investment plans, with big, impressive numbers for employment and impact.\nThis one admits that the previous \u00c2\u00a3200bn investment forecast for this decade now look more like \u00c2\u00a3160bn, and that's if politicians get off their case. A lot of that is yet to be committed, and industry is proving reluctant to make that commitment while Britain battles over the pace of transition to net zero carbon emissions.\nThis year's report is more of an argument against execution - a plea of mitigation by an industry that has swiftly moved from blue chip to polluting pariah.\nWith four recent tax rises from Conservatives, and Labour wanting to go further with the windfall tax as well as putting the brakes on new licences for drilling, OEUK says Britain is looking increasingly \"uninvestable\".\nIt is reminding the government today that it thought it secured a North Sea Transition Deal three years ago, but doesn't recognise it in the more hostile environment it now faces.\nThe trade body last month made its case to Labour's Treasury team, and says the discussions continue. But it also knows it has to win hearts and minds across the public too.\nPublic sympathy\nThe big carrot of a smooth and successful transition from fossil fuels to renewables could be \u00c2\u00a3450bn of investment by 2040, and many jobs that could go with that.\nMore than half of that big number would be offshore wind power, if governments and regulators can secure the best possible sequence of planning consents and grid connections. A big 'if'.\nHydrogen could be worth \u00c2\u00a325bn - much of it using renewable power, much of it cracking gas. The prospect here is growth to equal the scale of the electricity industry by the middle of the century. Carbon capture and storage could bring \u00c2\u00a334bn in investment.\nThe controversial bit is the \u00c2\u00a3145bn that the industry reckons could still be invested in oil and gas under British waters. It is emphasised this is not the value of the industry for the big producers associated with outrageously large profits, but the contract value to the supply chain.\nThere is likely to be more public sympathy and a lot more jobs in the companies supplying services and making more modest profits, across drilling, engineering, logistics, shipping, cables and catering, as well as finance, accountancy, law and geology expertise.\nHow many jobs? The OEUK says 200,000 are supported by oil and gas, and UK ministers use that figure to make the case for drilling with more vigour.\nBut the number is being contested by anti-oil campaigners, suggesting that the economic argument is getting some traction.\nThe next bit of the industry's case is that oil and gas should be allowed to keep drilling while it makes the transition into renewable energies.\nIt has mapped skills from one to the other, reckoning oil and gas can provide between 60 and 80% of the expertise required.\nDitch that expertise before the renewables investment ramps up, goes the argument, and Britain will have to import skills and equipment, as it already does in large-scale fabrication and shipbuilding.\nConversely, retain those skills, deploy them in renewables, and there will be an export market within 15 years worth more than \u00c2\u00a31,000bn. That's another suspiciously round number.\nDeclining trend\nThe part of the argument that affects us all is that there is nothing simple about \"just\" stopping oil and gas, when our collective demand and the need for it remains so high.\nThe industry doesn't quite say it, but there's a subliminal message: you depend on our produce, so don't blame us for giving you what you want, and need to lubricate your economy, keep you warm through the winter and go on holiday.\nOf all the UK's energy needs - across transport, heating, industry and power - oil and gas accounted for around 74% last year. From 2022, demand for gas was down 11% and oil was up 2%, mainly because more planes were flying post-pandemic.\nEven on the 'balanced pathway' to net zero by 2050, which has been set out by the Committee on Climate Change, oil and gas will continue to provide a fifth of that energy by mid-century. If so, it will then have to be fully offset, much of it by carbon capture and storage (a technology which anti-oil campaigners see as merely an excuse to keep drilling).\nProduction from UK waters met 47% of gas demand last year, and 57% of oil demand (a net figure, because much oil goes ov",
    "A woman who previously worked for the Ministry of Justice has objected to its plans to build a third prison in her village at a reopened public inquiry.\nThe blueprint for a 1,700-capacity jail on the border of Chorley and Leyland has faced opposition amid fears local roads would not be able to cope.\nIt is planned for Ulnes Walton close to HMP Garth and HMP Wymott.\nWendy Porter said it would only add to a \"frightening\" number of near misses on the roads in the area.\nThe plan for the so-called super prison has been met with a local campaign in opposition to it and it was thrown out by Chorley Council more than two years ago.\u00c2\nAn appeal by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) against that decision was later recommended for refusal by an independent planning inspector.\nHowever, Michael Gove - secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities - had already decreed his department would have the final say on the matter, having first taken into account the conclusions of inspector, Tom Gilbert-Wooldridge, who chaired the public inquiry when it first sat in 2022.\nIt was announced in January 2023 that Mr Gove was \"minded to\" to go against Mr Gilbert-Wooldridge's recommendation but only if he could be satisfied the road safety issues raised at the initial hearing could be \"satisfactorily addressed\".\nThe inquiry has this week been restarted to determine whether that is the case.\nThe same inspector is at the helm and he will hear evidence about revised measures designed to mitigate the impact of the proposed new prison on surrounding roads.\nMs Porter, who is still a government employee, was the first of several residents and councillors who made it clear that, for them, nothing had changed.\nShe told the inquiry she had worked for the MoJ until just two months ago.\nWhile she acknowledged more prison places were needed, she said the proposed location was not the right spot stressing that the first-hand experience of residents captured \"daily\" scenarios the official accident record did not, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\n\"When you are driving\u00e2\u0080\u00a6[along] Ulnes Walton Lane, you can be overtaking cyclists, close to blind bends, with horses on the other side or lorries.\u00c2\n\"And the number of cars I've seen in ditches - or near misses where people have had to swerve on very narrow stretches of road - [is] quite frightening.\"\n'Needless deaths'\nUlnes Walton parish councillor Nicola Watkinson - who lives on Ulnes Walton Lane - told the inquiry the tailbacks caused when cars get stuck behind cyclists or horses often led to drivers \"overtaking on the blind bends\".\n\"HGVs thunder past my house, making it shake,\" Ms Watkinson added, describing the route as \"narrow [and] windy, with tight bends\".\nUlnes Walton Parish Council chair Paul Doddenhof told the inquiry of an accident on New Lane in 2015 in which a young chef was killed.\nHe said the village did not want to see any more \"needless deaths\".\nThe planned category C jail would act as a resettlement prison for male offenders, preparing them for their eventual release.\u00c2\nThe reopened inquiry will hear a range of roads-related evidence from experts representing Chorley Council, the MoJ and the Ulnes Walton Action Group.\nIt is expected to conclude after Easter.\nWhy not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "It is the part that cemented Steve McQueen in the pantheon of Hollywood cool.\nBut how many know the American icon's role as a daredevil POW in the 1963 World War Two film The Great Escape is supposedly based on a Welshman?\nKen Rees, from Anglesey, was the bomber pilot who fought back against his Nazi captors to break free of an infamous prison camp in occupied Poland.\nThat heroic effort celebrates its 80th anniversary this weekend.\nHaving joined the RAF in 1939 at a tender 18, Flt Lt Rees was shot down over Norway on a secret mine-laying mission three years later.\nThe Wrexham-born airman then found himself in the Luftwaffe-run Stalag Luft III where, refusing to be beaten by the brutal treatment and harsh conditions, he made it his sole duty to escape.\nThe result was a 350ft (106m) tunnel, dug secretly and in painstaking increments by Rees and others under cover of darkness, or when the guards' backs were turned.\nDubbed \"Harry\", it was the longest of several subterranean routes to freedom carved out between the hut Rees shared with his fellow inmates and the camp's fortified perimeter.\nFamously recreated in the classic film, it featured one character, played by Scottish actor Gordon Jackson, pondering how they get rid of the mounds of earth they had excavated.\nEventually they came up with an ingenious solution.\nThe answer was to specially adapt the inside of their trouser legs with cloth bags to carry the dirt out into the yard where it could be dumped without the Germans noticing.\nAfter a long period of preparation the crucial breakout finally took place on the moonless night of 24 March 1944, but when the prisoners emerged from underground they found themselves just short of the cover provided by nearby treeline.\nOne of the escapees inadvertently making a noise then drew the attention of the sentry posted along the camp's watchtowers and shots began to ring out, starting a mad scramble for safety.\nUnfortunately for Rees, however, he had still been in the tunnel at this point and when he did poke his head out he found himself looking up at the barrel of a gun.\nMiraculously though, he was not shot: the guard who had taken aim was distracted by the shouts of a senior officer in the distance.\nInstead he was stripped of his clothes and placed in solitary confinement - known as \"the cooler\" - back at the camp.\nIt was while he was incarcerated there that he slowly discovered the fate of his 76 comrades who had managed to get away. Heartbreakingly, 50 were recaptured and shot by Hitler's Gestapo, while another 23 were sent back to other stalags.\nOnly three made it across Europe to safety.\nTowards the end of director Jon Sturges's film - and in one of cinema's most legendary chase sequences - McQueen's character, Captain Virgil Hilts, steals a motorcycle and tries to jump over a series of fences lining Germany's border with Switzerland.\nPursued on all sides by Nazi soldiers, he successfully clears one set of barriers before being shot at and falling off his bike to become entangled in barbed wire.\nLike Rees, Hilts is then sent to the cooler where he immediately begins planning his next escape.\nBut as his real-life Welsh inspiration modestly admitted before his death in 2014, aged 93, the comparison began and ended there.\n\"The only things we've got in common is that we both annoyed the Germans and ended up doing stretches in solitary,\" said Rees in an earlier interview.\n\"I didn't get out (of the prison camp) and if I did I wouldn't have been able to ride a motorbike anyway.\"\nHe further maintained his wartime experiences had mostly revolved around being constantly hungry and \"bored to tears\" - along with \"pulling faces\" at his captors and randomly letting down the tyres on their patrol vehicles.\nRees would remain under Nazi watch until May 1945 when the British Army arrived to liberate him.\nJourneying home to his wife Mary, whom he married just two weeks before being captured, the former draper returned to the relative peace and quiet of his old civilian life.\nBut his heroism in the face of adversity was never forgotten and, thanks to McQueen's timeless portrayal on the silver screen, it never will be.",

I felt really not great in my head over Christmas and I didn't really feel that much different when I took the kids away for new year.\n\"I had a lot of difficult things going on things I just can't talk about on Instagram.\"\nShe added that in the run-up to her theatre tour, which she was excited about, she had felt \"terrible\" and had taken some medication \"so I'd feel better, and be able to cope better with being a working single mum of three, and I was emotionally struggling with the break up from the father of my kids\".\nWhat is Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a condition that affects people's behaviour.\nPeople with ADHD can seem restless, may have trouble concentrating and may act on impulse.\nMost cases are diagnosed when children are under 12 years old but sometimes it is diagnosed later in childhood.\nHowever, on other occasions ADHD was not recognised at all when someone was a child and they are diagnosed later, as an adult.\nSource: NHS England\nShe added: \"I had a really bad reaction though to the medication (an ADHD medication) and it sent me into a psychosis for a few days which I didn't know I was in.\n\"I just love my kids so much x this bad reaction though was a few days before rehearsals were starting and sadly I just wasn't mentally well enough to do it.\n\"I was heartbroken as I've always been professional as an actress, but I needed to stay at home and feel better for me and my kids, with the help of my amazing parents.\"\nFlanagan said she was now in a \"really good happy place\", and has found therapy to be \"amazing\".\nShe added: \"I feel like I've worked on myself with things that were quite tough to me but I feel lighter now.\"\nFlanagan was replaced in the role of Miss Scarlett in the UK tour of Cluedo 2 by Strictly Come Dancing winner Ellie Leach.\nAt the time, it was announced that Flanagan had withdrawn from the show for \"medical reasons\".",
    "A quarter of water pollution incidents in 2022 were linked to agriculture and one in eight to the operations of Northern Ireland Water, according to a new report.\nThe NI Audit Office report found that water quality in rivers and lakes has not improved since 2015.\nIt also said that a 2027 EU target for standards will be missed.\nThe auditor general said funding deficits were \"likely to have impacted\" water quality, with more work required.\nAgriculture Minister Andrew Muir said investment in a number of areas and proper enforcement was key to turning the situation around.\n\"Farmers are part of the solution here but where there's offences being committed, these need to be investigated and enforcement action needs to be taken,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme.\n\"We can't have the situation continue to unfold where our environment is being polluted.\"\nDorinnia Carville's report also indicated that measures to tackle agricultural practices partly responsible for water quality issues \"have not been effective\".\nThe report examined how the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) has planned and managed its resources to address issues and meet regulatory requirements.\nFour recommendations were made, including development and publication of an overarching water quality improvement strategy by Daera.\nAmong the water quality issues identified, the report outlined that:\nIt went to to note that the continuing issues were \"partly attributable\" to agricultural practices which led to excess nutrient or fertiliser accumulating in rivers and lakes.\nBetween 2017 and 2021, 373 pollution incidents linked to farming and 68 linked to NI Water were deemed to be of high or medium severity.\nAgriculture accounts for 77% of the total land area of Northern Ireland and about 1% of farms are inspected by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) annually.\nMore than half (53%) of all water pollution incidents linked to agriculture in 2022 happened in the Neagh Bann River Basin District - this area covers all of County Armagh, large parties of counties Antrim, Londonderry, Down and Tyrone and a small area of County Fermanagh,\nMost of those incidents were in the River Blackwater area, with farm effluent mixture, silage and cattle waste most frequently detected.\n\"These outcomes provide cause for concern,\" the report added.\nThe Blackwater is one of six major rivers that feed into Lough Neagh, where blue-green algal blooms last year could be seen from space .\nThere were 572 pollution incidents linked to the operations of NI Water between 2017 and 2021, down 43% on 2014.\nOf these, almost half (46%) happened in the North Eastern River Basin District, which covers large parts of counties Antrim and Down and a small portion of County Londonderry.\nEnhanced monitoring requirements mean that no river or lake in Northern Ireland now has good chemical status.\nAnd when combined with ecological assessment, none have good overall status either.\nMore investment needed\nMs Carville said steps must be taken to achieve the required regulatory standards.\n\"Better and sustained engagement with stakeholders including the agriculture sector is needed and consideration should be given to enhancing the effectiveness of regulatory and inspection work,\" she said.\n\"Better use of data will also help, both in helping target testing at areas most at-risk and to help benchmark Northern Ireland with regions experiencing better outcomes in regards to water quality.\"\nMr Muir said his department was keen to take a \"three-pronged\" approach to help tackle the problems, including education and incentives to ensure people are aware of the implications of their behaviour.\nHe added Northern Ireland's waste water infrastructure needs to be invested in, as well as more invest \"significant more resources\" to tackle offenders.\n\"This report isn't easy reading, it is a very concerning report,\" Mr Muir added.\n\"But what we need to do is to show leadership to turn the situation around and I'm not going to be someone found wanting in that regard.\"\nPresident of the Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) David Brown said that prevention to pollution was key.\nHe told Evening Extra that",
    "US anti-abortion activists, including allies of Donald Trump, have a strategy to ban abortion nationwide - one that bypasses Congress and the American people. It's a plan that hinges on Mr Trump's re-election in November and the use of a little-known 19th Century law.\nAt this year's annual \"Pro-Life Summit\" on 20 January, guests listened to a keynote speech from Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America, one of the country's most influential anti-abortion groups.\nMs Dannenfelser is widely credited with convincing Donald Trump to appoint three anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court during his presidential term. In June 2022, those appointees helped overturn Roe v Wade, rescinding the nationwide right to abortion.\nIt was a generational victory for the anti-abortion movement. The runway had opened, activists said at the time, to an abortion-free future.\nBut in the nearly two years since, their campaign has stalled in crucial ways. The American public has shown consistent support for abortion access, even in conservative states.\nAnd the movement's ultimate goal - a federal abortion ban - has remained out of reach, a near-impossibility in a divided Congress that can unite behind few legislative priorities.\nThe political reality has not escaped anti-abortion campaigners.\nAddressing her audience in the grand ballroom of a Washington DC hotel a rapt crowd of the movement's most devoted followers - Ms Dannenfelser spent nearly half of her speech urging the audience not to lose hope.\n\"It hasn't been missed on any of us, right? That it has been hard,\" she said. \"We all know.\"\nBut anti-abortion activists may have a trump card. Conservative leaders, including allies of Mr Trump, have mapped out a new path to outlaw abortion. The plan could work, experts say, if the former president returns to the White House.\n\"There could be a de facto nationwide ban that Trump could try to enforce on day one if he wins,\" said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, and a leading expert on the US abortion debate. \"It's the Comstock Act.\"\nA 150-year-old law\nThe Comstock Act, championed by anti-vice crusader Anthony Comstock and passed in 1873, made it a federal crime to send or receive any material deemed \"obscene, lewd or lascivious\". The statute makes specific mention of birth control and abortion, barring any materials designed or intended for \"the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion\".\nOver the next century, various court rulings clarified the law's meaning, gradually narrowing its scope. In 1971, Congress removed most of Comstock's restrictions on contraceptives and two years later, through Roe, the Supreme Court established a constitutional right to abortion. By then, the act was seen as a largely unenforceable relic, and remained dormant for 50 years.\nBut now, within right-wing circles, the Comstock Act is being revived.\nWithout Roe in place to guarantee access to abortion, the logic is straightforward. According to a broad reading of the law, the mailing of any materials related to abortion - through the United States Postal Service and through private carriers like UPS and FedEx - would be illegal.\nBy preventing any of the medications or tools necessary for the procedure from reaching hospitals and clinics, Comstock would act as an effective block on abortions, getting around the need for Congress to pass any new legislation.\n\"It is sweepingly broad language,\" said Rachel Rebouch\u00c3\u00a9, dean and law professor at Temple University Law school, and a leading scholar in reproductive health law. \"If it was applied literally, it [Comstock] could be a ban on an abortion in an indirect way, because everything gets mailed to outfit abortion clinics.\"\nThe conservative strategy\nAnti-abortion activists and leading conservative groups have started preparing for this approach, crafting legal arguments and political strategies that reinterpret Comstock as an enforceable abortion ban.\nJosh Craddock, a lawyer and scholar with the conservative James Wilson Institute, has written extensively against the legality of abortion. He said fellow anti-abortion activists had coalesced around Comstock, describing it as \"one of the most promising ways to help advance the cause of life in America right now\".\n\"It doesn't depend on Congress to act, or the Supreme Court to rule, there's already federal law that protects unborn life,\" he said. \"That's very black and white.\"\nComstock will be raised before the Supreme Court this week as part of arguments from a group of anti-abortion activists and doctors who want federal approval of the abortion drug mifepristone to be withdrawn.\nAnd it has been invoked specifically in the conservative Heritage Foundation's playbook for the next Republican administration, dubbed Project 2025.\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe, there is no longer any block on enforcing this statute, the Foundation said of Comstock. \"The Department of Justice in the next conserv",

    "Nike's \"playful interpretation\" of the St George's Cross on England's new football kit has ignited a row about national identity. Critics have branded the design \"disrespectful\", among other things, but battles over England shirts have a long and literally colourful back story.\nEngland taking on Brazil at Wembley is one of the great sporting occasions. Two proud footballing nations boasting instantly recognisable kits. But the build-up to their latest clash has been dominated by a tiny cross on the neck of the home team's new shirt.\nManufacturer Nike has changed the cross of St George, with its horizontal bar now a combination of blues and purples rather than the red of the original flag.\nPolitical leaders , including the prime minister and leader of the opposition, have added their voices to a row which has reignited the passions that regularly erupt with each redesign of what is, in essence, a plain white shirt.\nAs the FA pointed out on Friday, \"it is not the first time\" different colours have been used, with the 2010 jersey being a case in point.\nThe man behind that design, Peter Saville CBE, says the red cross immediately posed him a challenge.\nEarlier this week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called the flag a \"source of pride\" which \"we shouldn't mess with\", while Labour leader Keir Starmer described it as a unifying symbol that doesn't need changing. The FA said this week that the flag \"unites and inspires us\".\nIn 2010, Saville felt markedly different.\nHe says it had, in his eyes, \"come to represent a particular type of bloody-minded person - usually with a degree of what we might call aggressive patriotism\".\n\"That was really a problem [for me],\" says the graphic designer behind some of Factory Records' most famous covers in the 1980s.\n\"You can't ignore the fact it's the national symbol and you realise you're dealing with it straight away, [but] I felt that symbol had become marginalised and when I saw it I didn't relate to it.\n\"Yet there's nothing wrong with the symbol in any way. It's not even overtly Christian, it's just a shape like a square or a circle.\"\nGiven the brief of designing a \"colourful white strip\" by then-manufacturer Umbro, he likened the job to making a new flag for the nation - \"in some ways bigger\".\nDetermined to avoid what he describes as \"gratuitous pattern-making\", he instead looked to signify \"modern England\" in a \"provocative but positive\" manner.\nTo that end, he hit upon using the shape in an array of colours across the entire shirt.\n\"If I can put it diplomatically, it's a very colourful nation,\" he said. \"I live in a very colourful society.\n\"I wanted the shirt to be for everyone because when the national team are playing it is for everyone. No-one should be excluded.\n\"It's interesting we're talking about it in 2024. I thought it was pretty topical 10 years ago; maybe it's more so now.\"\n'You can't see it'\nViewing the national side's famous white shirt as an \"extraordinary canvas\", Saville's design process proved intriguing but ultimately dispiriting as, he says, his concept was \"neutralised\".\n\"I never knew how it landed with the FA. I remember at one point a little bit of negative feedback attributed to [England's then-manager] Fabio Capello, but whether it was from him or not who knows?\n\"He didn't want the crosses too big [I was told], so the pattern got smaller and smaller and ended up just on the shoulder panels. You can't see it on a TV screen.\n\"As an experience it was quite an anti-climax because I felt there would be some discussion or feedback, but almost nobody talked about it. To some extent because almost nobody noticed it.\"\nBut among those who did spot it, he says some of the reaction - especially on internet forums - was \"eye-opening\" and \"vitriolic\".\nUmbro did not respond to a request for comment on Saville's criticisms, but the designer maintains he wanted to capture the pride he feels when he sees the diversity in England teams as they take to the field.\n\"It's cool when you see the England team. That's kind of what I wanted to celebrate with this and it's just disappointing that it got pushed under the radar.\"\nThe reaction was even stronger this week when Nike released its latest England home and away efforts as part of a reported \u00c2\u00a3400m deal with the FA.\nTo be be worn by England's men's, women's and para teams, the change kit sees purple used for the first time, while the home shirt is marketed as \"a modern take on a classic white strip\".\nThe use of navy, light blue and purple alongside red in the cross on the back of the shirt's collar was described by Nike as \"a playful interpretation\" and an attempt to \"unite and inspire\".\nBut, as with Saville's design, critics have branded it \"disrespectful\" and an example of \"virtue signalling\".\nThe FA has defended the kit and said on Friday: \"We are very proud of the red and white St George's cross - the England flag. We understand what it means to our fans, and how it unites and inspires, and it will be displayed prominent",

    "Former Conservative MP Scott Benton has resigned, setting up a by-election to replace him in his Blackpool South constituency.\nHe was facing a local vote on whether to remove him, following the imposition of a Commons ban in the wake of a lobbying scandal.\nIt followed a newspaper sting in April last year, after which he was suspended as a Tory MP.\nLocal voters had until 22 April to decide whether to sack him as their MP.\nBut in a statement on Facebook, he has now announced he has officially tendered his resignation, setting up a vote to replace him.\nIt will create another headache for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, following a string of by-election defeats in recent months.\nIt is understood that the Conservatives will start the process to set the by-election on Tuesday, the last day before Parliament's Easter break.\nThis means the by-election would take place on 2 May, when voters in England and Wales go to the polls for local and mayoral elections.\nMr Benton took the Blackpool South seat at the 2019 election by a slim 3,690 majority. It had previously been held by Labour since 1997.\nDefending the seat will prove a challenge for the Tories, who have seen much bigger majorities overturned by Labour in by-elections over the last six months.\nThe Conservatives are heavily trailing Labour ahead of the general election expected later this year.\nNewspaper sting\nMr Benton has been sitting as an independent MP since losing the Tory whip in April last year, following an investigation by the Times.\nHe was secretly filmed by undercover reporters, who were posing as gambling industry investors, saying he could lobby ministers.\nHe was also recorded offering to table parliamentary questions and leak a confidential policy paper.\nHe lost an appeal against a suspension, after a Commons investigation found he had caused \"significant damage\" to Parliament's reputation.\nMPs approved a 35-day Commons ban towards the end of last month.\nThis triggered a process under which he could have been removed if 10% of registered voters in Blackpool South signed a recall petition to get rid of him.\nBut this will no longer run, with the government confirming on Monday that Mr Benton has now officially stood down as an MP.",

Laws vary by country .\nThis will be the third time that the Scottish Parliament has considered the issue.\nIn 2010, MSPs rejected Margo MacDonald's End of Life Assistance Bill by 85 votes to 16.\nThe independent MSP, who had Parkinson's Disease, died in 2014 and the cause was taken up by Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens.\nThe following year, his Assisted Suicide Bill was rejected by 82 votes to 36.\nThe title of Mr McArthur's bill \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Assisted Dying rather than Assisted Suicide \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reflects a change in approach from campaigners.\nCritics such as Dr Fiona MacCormick of the Association for Palliative Medicine (APM) say the new terminology is \"harmful and unhelpful,\" adding, \"they've used very euphemistic language to talk about suicide.\"\nMr McArthur says he would \"strongly disagree,\" because \"we're talking about people with a terminal illness, and the fact they are going to die has already been established.\"\nThe MSP for Orkney Islands believes there has been a significant \"mood shift\" among his fellow parliamentarians since the issue was last debated and is hopeful that his proposal will be approved.\nA new poll, carried out by Opinium Research for the campaign group Dignity in Dying, suggests clear public support for the proposal, with 78% of respondents in Scotland saying they supported \"making it legal for someone to seek 'assisted dying' in the UK.\"\nGillie Davison is among those supporters - her husband Steve died of throat cancer last April, at the age of 56.\nMs Davison, from Hawick in the Scottish Borders, says even high-quality palliative care did not ease his suffering in the final days and hours.\n\"It wasn't a good death because he was distressed and he was upset,\" she explains.\n\"It wasn't what he wanted. He wanted that choice.\"\nShe believes an assisted dying bill would have allowed her husband to \"go to sleep\" peacefully at home and could prevent other families from enduring a similarly \"devastating\" experience in future.\nChanging the law, she says, would be \"compassionate and kind.\"\nBut Dr MacCormick says she is concerned about the potential for inaccurate diagnosis and prognosis, undetected coercion, and fluctuating mental capacity in seriously-ill patients.\n\"As a palliative care doctor, when I see patients who are suffering, I don't see the answer to their suffering as being to end the life of the sufferer,\" she says.\nBut some terminally-ill patients say they would find the option reassuring even if they did not use it.\nIn 2015, at the age of 26, Mandie Malcolm from Falkirk was diagnosed with breast cancer which had spread to other parts of her body.\nShe was told that her life expectancy was two to five years.\nNow 34, Ms Malcolm is still alive thanks to advances in cancer treatment but",
    "A junior doctor who was jailed after he hit and injured four people when he fell asleep at the wheel of his car has been suspended for nine months.\nDr James Celaire was returning from a hospital night shift when he crashed into two adults and two children at a zebra crossing in Bradford in 2020.\nA tribunal imposed the ban after ruling his fitness to practise was impaired as a result of his conviction.\nThe panel said it was \"necessary to uphold public confidence\".\nCelaire was jailed for 28 months in 2022 after he pleaded guilty to four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.\n'Deliberate decision'\nThe Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) heard Celaire had been working in the renal department of Bradford Royal Infirmary at the time of the crash in Hudson Avenue.\nThe panel was told that on the morning of 9 December 2020 he had completed his second 12-hour night shift of the week and was driving home to Leeds.\nHe told the hearing his last memory was \"seeing a zebra crossing with no-one on it\", but that he must have \"fallen asleep at the wheel\" and veered into the group of pedestrians.\nOne of the adults had to have their left leg amputated below the knee as a result of the injuries sustained in the collision, while the children, aged six and four, both suffered broken legs.\nJailing him in 2022, Judge Jonathan Rose had said that while Celaire had not made \"a deliberate decision to drive dangerously\" he had made \"a deliberate decision to drive when it was not safe\" due to his tiredness.\nHe told Celaire he \"should have taken a rest at your place of work where there was the facility to do so\".\n'Genuine remorse\nDuring the MPTS hearing, Sarah Barlow, on behalf of Celaire, said he had shown \"tremendous insight\" into what had happened.\nShe highlighted his guilty plea, his \"genuine remorse\" and the fact he had helped out at the scene of the crash.\nMs Barlow added that he was also keen to \"raise awareness of post on-call tiredness to the wider healthcare community\".\nShe also pointed out the additional \"stress and work commitments\" placed on medics at the time of the collision due to the Covid pandemic.\nReturning their decision, the MPTS panel members said they were \"satisfied a period of suspension would appropriately mark the seriousness\" of Celaire's conduct.\nThey added that he had \"developed full insight\" and it was \"highly unlikely\" he would repeat the offence.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire n Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Gate 96 is little more than a hole in Gaza's border fence.\nIts rutted track leads away towards Gaza City; a bumpy lifeline, quickly lost in thick evening darkness.\nWhen the UN accuses Israel of deliberately keeping aid flows at a trickle, Israel points to Gate 96 - one of several new aid routes it has approved, along with airdrops and a maritime corridor from Cyprus.\nAlong the border fence, seven lorries loaded with food aid are lined up and waiting to cross, their engines slowly turning beneath the occasional boom of artillery.\nThis new crossing point takes them directly into Gaza's desperate northern areas, and avoids a long, difficult drive through the conflict zone.\nBut with the UN warning that northern Gaza is weeks away from famine, international demands to ramp up the amount of aid are getting more insistent.\nIsrael says it has facilitated more than 350 aid trucks into northern Gaza over the past month. Aid agencies say the territory as a whole needs 500 a day.\n\"The bottleneck of this chain does not lie with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],\" said Colonel Moshe Tetro, head of the army's Coordination and Liaison Administration, which handles approvals for aid convoys.\nHe told the BBC that the army's job was to \"facilitate the entrance of humanitarian aid into Gaza\" and that the hold-ups lay with the logistical ability of aid agencies to distribute it on the other side.\nHe pointed to the trucks waiting to cross, saying the evidence was right in front of us. Twenty trucks had been approved to cross that night, he said, but only seven showed up.\n\"We took a lot of measures to enlarge the amount of humanitarian aid,\" he said. \"But the UN and other international organisations have some bottlenecks regarding the amount of trucks, amount of truck drivers, manpower, working hours\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\"\nMatthew Hollingworth, country director of the World Food Programme (WFP), was on one of the trucks idling by the border fence that night. He told the BBC there was a specific reason why the WFP had not been able to provide all 20 vehicles.\n\"On this particular convoy, we were given a limit of 15 vetted drivers by the IDF that were cleared to use this route, but only seven were available to us\", he said.\nSome of the approved drivers had gone to Gaza City the previous day, and were stuck there, he said. Even driving an empty lorry back through Gaza needs Israeli army approval.\n\"We need 50, 60, 70, 80 truck drivers cleared to use these routes every single day,\" he said. \"We need more entry points to northern Gaza and Gaza City, and we need early approvals so that we can run multiple convoys every single day.\"\nIsrael is keen to show the world it's allowing more aid into Gaza - but says it's not responsible for the amount of aid actually going in, or the ability of agencies to distribute it on the ground.\nInternational law says different: that Israel has a duty, not just to open the gates, but to use all means available to it to get food and medicine to the people under its control.\nCol Tetro tells me there is no shortage of food in Gaza, and that if Hamas wants to the change the situation there, they should end the war.\nAsked about the warnings of famine, and images of acutely malnourished children in Gaza's hospitals, he repeated the same phrases, again and again.\n\"There is no starvation in Gaza,\" he said. \"There is no shortage of food.\"\nOn Sunday, Gaza's main relief agency, Unrwa, said Israel had banned it from delivering any more food to northern Gaza.\nIsrael says the agency is linked to Hamas, and that it would continue to work with organisations that \"are not involved in terror\".\nUnrwa's director, Philippe Lazzarini, said the ban was \"outrageous\" and accused Israel of intentionally obstructing aid.\nThe agency recently tried to restart convoys after a two month pause, which began when one of its lorries was shelled during a delivery in January.\nAt Gate 96, army vehicles buzz around the convoy, before the crossing point opens and the trucks move off into the night.\nThis slim channel between Israel and Gaza crossed only by aid and army; bringing food and war, life and death.",

    "Sir Keir Starmer has promised to \"level up\" regions more effectively than the Conservatives by giving extra powers to local leaders.\nLaunching the party's local election campaign, the Labour leader said the Tories had failed to deliver on their pledge to reduce regional inequality.\nFurther devolution was \"essential\" to make the ambition a reality, he added.\nIt comes as the party confirms details of its plans to offer new powers to councils in England.\nLabour says if it wins the next general election, it would extend the responsibilities given in recent years to mayors in city regions, such as Tees Valley and West Yorkshire.\nIt would also offer extra powers to areas that are yet to secure them.\nElections are taking place on 2 May for more than 100 local authorities and mayors in England, and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.\nThe Conservative promise to \"level up\" different parts of the UK was one of the flagship political slogans of former prime minister Boris Johnson.\nThe promise has been widely credited as a factor in helping the party take swathes of previously safe Labour seats at the 2019 election in former industrial areas in the Midlands and north of England.\nIn a speech in Dudley, Sir Keir acknowledged that the pledge had \"struck a chord\" with voters and was a \"good ambition\".\nBut he said the Conservatives had failed to put in the \"hard yards\" to make the plan work, adding their promises to the public to level up their areas had been \"preying on their hopes\".\n'Dragons' Den'\nGiving more power away from Westminster, he added, was \"absolutely essential for taking on regional inequality\".\nHe was also critical of the government's record on levelling up spending, noting a recent report from MPs that only 10% of funding earmarked for projects has actually been spent .\nSpeaking before him, deputy leader Angela Rayner said councils had been forced to go \"cap in hand\" to government to fund schemes, likening Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove to an investor on TV show Dragons' Den.\nLabour has promised that, if elected, it would give extra powers in areas like housing, transport and planning to those areas that have acquired responsibilities in recent years under \"devolution deals\".\nIt also says it would invite all areas of England without a deal to bid for new powers, with councils located in \"sensible economic geographies\" joining together to apply.\nThe party has also confirmed that it would place a legal obligation on all areas with a deal to produce plans setting out how they would use the new powers to boost economic growth.\nBut Sir Keir acknowledged that, given the economic backdrop, his party would not be able to \"turn the taps on\" to boost strained council budgets. \"The way out of that is to grow our economy,\" he added.\n'Reduce the strains'\nAsked whether his plans would be accompanied by new spending, he said improving the spending rates on existing projects would \"release a huge amount of money\".\nHe added that Labour was also aiming to boost investment from the private sector by providing investors with a \"viable plan\" for boosting growth.\nSpeaking afterwards to the BBC, Sir Keir promised that councils would be \"better off\" after five years if his party wins power - but declined to say whether they would get more cash in the first year of a Labour government.\nHe pledged, however, Labour would \"reduce the strains\" on local finances through multi-year budgets, ending no-fault evictions and bringing down inflation by \"stabilising\" the economy.\nThere have been a series of devolution deals in recent years - with agreements with varying powers for local leaders agreed for 22 areas in England.\nThe government's Levelling Up and Regeneration Act, which passed in October, set a target that every part of England that wanted a deal should get one by 2030.",

We are in this journey together, and I'm so thankful for that.\"\nDiljit Dosanjh is the most recent example of an Indian star capturing global attention with performances at Coachella and collaborations with the likes of Sia and Ed Sheeran.\nAnd Zo believes W.i.S.H. can help I-pop reach an international audience.\n\"We are ready to travel across the globe and perform our songs everywhere.\"\nW.i.S.H. were created by music producer Mikey McCleary under Sony Music Entertainment, and Ri, who was the first member cast, has been overwhelmed by the positive feedback from fans.\n\"It hadn't even been a day since our song had released, and we already had tonnes of fan pages. And that's when we realised how much India really wanted this and was waiting for this.\n\"If young girls see us and then decide to be pop stars, that is amazing. You can do whatever you want. The world is your stage, it's your oyster,\" says Ri.\n\"You just have to believe in yourself.\"\nAlthough they are excited to be India's first girl band in over two decades, Zo admits there is still a sense of pressure.\n\"We have to now set the new standard, so there are a lot of expectations for us.\n\"But at the same time, it's very exciting because now we can be the trendsetters,\" she says.\nBut W.i.S.H. have also been studying famous Western girl groups like the Spice Girls and Little Mix, and want to follow their lead by embracing each member's individuality.\n\"Zo is really calm and sweet, I'm the sassy one, and Suchi is naughty and fiery. Ri is the boss, the leader and the mama bear,\" says Sim.\nAnd sisterhood is something that is very important to them too - especially with Sim and Ri being siblings.\n\"I'm just happy me and my sister are together for this experience,\" says Sim.\nWith high aims, the group are already thinking about who they would like to collaborate with.\n\"We love BTS, we're four girls, and they are four guys I think we would make an amazing track,\" Sim says.\nSuchi says that, in this moment, W.i.S.H. are living a dream.\n\"I'm enjoying everything about life right now because we've been working towards W.i.S.H. for two years, so this is just an exciting time for all of us.\n\"It's our turn now,\" she says.\nListen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network live from 15:00-18:00 Monday to Thursday - or listen back here .",
    "Sheridan Smith is one of Britain's best known actresses, but her new role may be her most challenging yet.\nShe's starring in the musical Opening Night, about a star with mental health problems who is unravelling on stage.\nIt is a part Smith says is \"close to the bone\" after her own personal problems saw her temporarily pull out of Funny Girl in the West End in 2016.\nBut the star, 42, says after her \"wobble\" and \"covering herself in tattoos\", she has her confidence back.\nOpening Night, which is based on the 1977 film of the same name, follows a theatre company preparing to stage a show on Broadway.\nThe music and lyrics are by singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, while the show is directed by Olivier Award winner Ivo van Hove.\nIn the story, Myrtle, played by Smith, is having a nervous breakdown after the death of one of her fans.\nThe Cilla and Gavin and Stacey star tells the BBC that Myrtle is \"clinging to life by her fingernails\" and the audience have no idea if she will make her own opening night.\nThe parallels with her past have been drawn by Smith herself. \"I have been in my own mental crisis before, which was quite well publicised, so there are definitely parts of myself that I can bring to the character,\" she says.\nIt's eight years since Smith pulled out of the musical Funny Girl because of stress, exhaustion and dealing with her father's cancer diagnosis.\nShe later returned to the show, but the period deeply affected her.\n\"I had a wobble, covered myself in a tattoos. I lost a lot of confidence around that time, but it has come back thankfully, due to friends and supportive people.\"\nOpening Night will also be the first time she has been able to show her tattoos at work. Usually they are covered with heavy make-up.\nPart of Opening Night takes place outside the theatre, with Myrtle collapsing outside the stage door in a drunken state and the scene projected onto screens inside the auditorium.\nWord is now out about the scene, and Sheridan says people \"have been crowding around\" the West End theatre to watch.\n\"I would love people to get involved,\" she laughs, \"because it adds to it all, makes it all so live and real, that is never done in the theatre.\"\n'Public understood I was grieving'\nDespite what she calls her \"well publicised\" troubles, Smith says she has always been able to rely on support from the public, especially after the death of her father in 2016.\n\"I am very grateful because the public always stood by me, even though whatever went on in the press,\" Smith tells the BBC. \"They understood that when you are grieving, you can't really explain what you go through and people were stopping me and cuddling me on the street.\"\nThe actress says people from her home near Doncaster often make the trip to London to see her in shows, adding that the \"whole village came to see the Legally Blonde musical wearing pink cowboy hats\".\nOne issue that is currently much discussed is whether the upper classes and people who went to private school are too dominant in the arts.\nSmith describes herself as \"proudly working class\" and says \"she has been one of the lucky ones\", having worked consistently since she moved to London when she was 16.\nShe hopes \"it is getting better for working-class kids being able to get into drama schools\".\nSmith became a mum in 2020 and says her son is \"the reason I do it all\".\nHe has visited her at the theatre and been to her dressing room, but Smith jokes that Opening Night is not a show for a three-year-old.\nHer son did join her on stage in 2023 during the curtain call for another recent play, Shirley Valentine.\n\"He came on for the bows and was loving it, waving to the crowds,\" Smith says.\nHowever, the actress is perhaps not as keen about her son following in her footsteps.\n\"I thought, oh no!

    "The average air temperature in Cairo, like the average water temperature, doesn't fall much below 20C at any time of year.\nSo it may come as a surprise to find one of the keenest advocates of cold water swimming in Wales - where winter freshwater temperatures routinely drop close to freezing - is an Egyptian who spent his formative years in the heat and dust of a desert.\nFor Amr Madbouly, a decarbonisation engineer at the beleaguered Tata steelworks in Port Talbot, the sharp contrast is one of the things that makes it so appealing to him, and has turned him into an enthusiastic promoter of Welsh nature on social media.\n\"Somebody who's coming from a very dry and rough desert environment, when you see green it's amazing. It looks like heaven,\" he explains.\n\"When you have so much heat and sun in your life you long for cold and you're like, finally, it's colder now. I love it.\"\nIn fact he loves it so much he rises from his bed at home in Bridgend at 05:00 each day to go and plunge into a river or waterfall.\nHis favourite place is Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons) National Park and coming to Wales was motivated by a desire to live close to its mountains and waterfalls.\nAmr, 34, said he was interested in the \"Celtic environment and nature\" from a young age and started learning more about the landscape when his girlfriend, whom he later married, sent him pictures of the countryside near her home after they first met aged 17.\nOn finishing studying in Cairo, he moved to Germany with his wife and then on to the UK after Brexit, initially to be near family near Newcastle.\nHowever, he said: \"One of my dreams has always been to live near the Brecon Beacons and the Welsh countryside because I always found it very special and so spectacular with all the hills and the mountains and lakes.\n\"I found a job in the steelworks and was like 'whoa, that's the one'. I applied for it, got it and we moved to Wales. It's been about six years ago now and I'm absolutely loving it.\"\nOne of his very first forays into the Beacons \"when I fell in deep love with Wales\" was at Llyn y Fan Fach, one of a pair of lakes bookending a dramatic walk along a ridgeway in the western end of the national park in Carmarthenshire.\n\"This place is marvellous. It's an absolute heaven. This is an amazing place to walk, to enjoy the atmosphere. It's fantastic.\"\nAnother favourite spot?\n\"The Llyn Cwm Llwch by Pen-y-Fan is a nice little lake in front of the mountain and it's marvellous. It's really fresh all around the year.\n\"You've got to be very mindful and respectful of the cold water because it can be an absolute grace, a healer and be really good for you, but at the same time if you don't know what you're doing it drains your energy really, really fast and that's the risk.\"\nIt was the Covid pandemic and the lockdowns that really ignited Amr's passion for the countryside.\n\"When they allowed us to go out more, that's when I really started [thinking] 'I'm going to get out. I can't cope any more staying in the house'.\"\nThe pandemic also inadvertently entrenched a love of cold water swimming. After being vaccinated against Covid, he developed an auto-immune flare, later diagnosed as arthritis.\n\"I was absolutely devastated because my fingers are swollen, I can't close my fist, I can't walk, my vision is full of black dots. I was struggling with everything, getting dizzy, fainting, the whole system gone upside down,\" he remembers.\nDoctors wanted to put him on immunosuppressant medication, but first agreed that he could look into lifestyle factors to see if that could help.\n\"I kept searching and found a crazy guy called Wim Hof [the Iceman cold water advocate], and I started learning all the breathing techniques and the cold water. I was already in cold water before but this is really cold [in an ice barrel].\n\"I started doing that every single day and I started seeing the change happening every single day. I start going for blood tests and the doctors are seeing change and things are improving.\"\nAnd it spiralled from there.\n\"I had severe depression and I became so much better in mood,\" he said.\n\"I can't imagine myself not doing this now because every time I'm not feeling well, or frustrated or down, maybe about the job situation, once I get in I'm just somebody else.\n\"I come out so happy, smiling, excited about things and that's why I do it.\"\nHis daily routine now starts at about 04:30 or 05:00 with \"my little dip in a river or some sort of waterfall\" before heading to work but he \"can't pass the day without doing it\".\nOn weekends he takes his family along with him: \"It's something I'm addicted to.

    "Buyers of funeral plans from a Hull funeral home already at the centre of a police inquiry said they have been told their policies are non-existent.\nRita Goldspink and Kevin Newton paid about \u00c2\u00a32,500 each for plans bought from Legacy Independent Funeral Directors in 2018 and 2012 respectively.\nEach has been told separately that there is no trace of their policy on the third-party insurer's database.\nLegacy funeral home has been contacted for comment.\nTwo people have been bailed in a police investigation of Legacy Independent Funeral Directors that began on 6 March, following a report of \"concern for care of the deceased\".\nRachel Marshall, from Hull, said the pre-paid funeral plan for her mother, Rita Goldspink, 76, had cost \u00c2\u00a32,700 in April 2018, six months after Legacy had organised her father's funeral.\nAfter news emerged of the Humberside Police investigation, Ms Marshall said she contacted the insurer and discovered they could not find \"my mum's name on their database\".\nShe said she was later told by the insurer that she should have received a welcome pack containing details of the plan shortly after purchase.\n\"My mum was absolutely devastated and I was in total shock,\" said Ms Marshall.\n\"All that money is gone.\n\"I'm gutted and have started to realise through conversations [with others that] there are more of us with these fake policies.\"\nKevin Newton, 69, also from Hull, said he was \"mortified\" to learn that his pre-paid funeral plan, which had cost him \u00c2\u00a32,239, was similarly untraceable.\nHe said when he bought the third-party policy in 2012, he had received written confirmation and a receipt from Legacy.\nShortly afterwards a pack had arrived in the post, which he had believed contained official documents about his policy.\nHowever, after his family raised concerns with him last week, Mr Newton said he had phoned the third-party insurer and was told there was no trace of the policy.\nHis daughter Kerry, 35, said: \"It's absolutely shocking because it's a lot of money for my dad to fork out and it's not like he can [afford it] again.\n\"I know my dad's done it so me and my brother don't have to worry about him when the time comes. It's just devastating.\n\"It's unforgiveable.\"\n'Are they there?'\nAnother woman from Hull, who wishes to remain anonymous, said she \"can't get [her] head round\" being told there was no record of her \u00c2\u00a32,500 pre-paid funeral plan, bought from Legacy in 2016.\nShe said she had bought the plan after using the company to arrange the funerals of both her parents, who had died three weeks apart.\nShe too had believed a pack she received was evidence of the third-party policy. But she discovered last week the policy did not exist, the woman said.\n\"Initially... all I was concerned about was my mum and dad. They're supposed to be buried together in the same grave. I hope they are but I just don't know now. I'm thinking: are they there?\n\"But now - finding this policy is worthless - it's just a cherry on the icing, really. I'm completely shocked.\n\"I mean, I'm still more troubled about mum and dad at the moment. But I know I'll never get any answers on that.\"\nThe BBC has seen documents given to all three families who bought the plans from Legacy.\nIt is unclear whether Legacy submitted the filled-in application forms to the insurer.\nIn a statement, the third-party insurer, Ecclesiastical Planning Services, said: \"This is a deeply distressing incident for the families affected.\n\"We are unable to comment on individual cases but we are working with families who contact us to establish if they have a plan with us.\"\nAll three families said they had \"lost trust\" in the financial sector, particularly in the funeral industry, and have called for tighter regulations.\nThe woman said: \"I think anyone setting up a funeral business should have some sort of qualification or have been trained. And there has to be regular inspections.\"\nMs Marshall urged anyone who had bought a pre-paid funeral plan to \"check your policy\".\n\"More or less everything goes on trust,\" she said.\nFew details about the police investigation have been revealed but a quantity of ashes and 35 bodies were recovered from Legacy's Hessle Road premises and taken to another mortuary. The families involved have been contacted, Humberside Police have said.\nA 46-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of prevention of a lawful and decent burial, fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position. They have since been released on bail while police inquiries continue .\nThe force said its dedicated helpline numbers remain open.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) , and Instagram .

    "A drag queen and photographer has said he struggled with severe fatigue before he was diagnosed with a brain tumour.\nEddie Adams, 35, from Bedford, suffered a seizure in 2017, and later a scan showed he had anaplastic astrocytoma. He was left with a misshapen skull after surgery.\n\"Everyone just thought I was very lazy,\" he said.\nHe is now preparing to front the Brain Tumour Research fundraising event Wear A Hat Day on 28 March.\nMr Adams, who came third in a pilot audition for RuPaul's Drag Race in 2015, was in his 20s when he noticed he was gradually \"becoming less and less\".\n\"I was becoming more lacklustre. I just seemed to go downhill,\" he said. \"I was almost bedridden most of the time. It was fatigue.\"\nMr Adams - whose drag persona is \"Eddie OK Adams\" - moved to Brighton to perform as an artist in a \"make or break\" career move.\nBut after he visited his doctor a few times, he had a seizure in his garden in August 2017, and a subsequent CT scan showed he had a brain tumour.\nDue to having regular migraines, \"I knew something was going on so when they said it was a brain tumour it wasn't a total surprise\".\nHe added: \"Everyone just thought I was very lazy, so everyone's obviously eating their words.\"\nMr Adams had to \"relearn and rewire my brain\". That meant relearning to talk and do everyday tasks such as brushing his teeth.\nAfter his first surgery, he said it felt like the pain in his body had been \"alleviated\".\n\"I remember saying to my dad, 'Wow! This is what it feels like to be just a normal person. I can't believe what I've been missing out on'.\"\nBut several weeks later, Mr Adams was rushed back to hospital with an infection, and that resulted in a large part of his skull being removed.\nHe was told in 2017 that he was likely to survive for only three to five years. He wanted to live his life as best he could, so he went to university in London for a year and set up a photography studio in Bedford.\nIf people look and stare at his head it does not bother him, as \"20 years ago I was walking around the high street in high platform boots and miniskirts, so I'm used to people looking at me\".\nHaving outlived his prognosis, his main goal now is to raise funds and awareness for Brain Tumour Research to help find a cure.\nThe charity's Charlie Allsebrook said: \"Not only has he bravely shared his story far and wide to help us raise awareness of brain tumours and the need for greater investment in research but he has starred in hard-hitting campaigns like Stop The Devastation and raised more than \u00c2\u00a33,000 to support our vital research, inspiring friends and family to do the same.\n\"His resilience and determination to help others is truly inspiring and we remain grateful and in awe of his impassioned support.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Aurigny's Embraer jet will be removed from service at the end of April, according to a letter from the airline's boss.\nIt comes after the airline announced it would be simplifying its fleet to use primarily ATR 72-600 aircraft .\nIn a letter seen by the BBC, chief executive Nico Bezuidenhout said \"costly maintenance work\" meant \"the exit of the Embraer jet is time sensitive\".\nHe said extra aircraft would be leased.\nIn a letter to all deputies, Mr Bezuidenhout confirmed the company was in the process of leasing extra ATR 72-600 and Q400s to cover.\nIt said Aurigny was working with Italian airline Avanti Air until 30 April to provide a 78-seat Q400 aircraft alongside its two operational ATRs.\nWhile the plane from Avanti Air is in operation, the Embraer jet will operate a reduced schedule.\nMr Bezuidenhout said: \"Aurigny's third owned ATR aircraft is scheduled to return to service by mid-April 2024, subject to the availability of parts and components\".\nHe also said his company was looking to lease another ATR to cover if the ATR owned by Aurigny was out of action for longer than expected.\n\"The first of Aurigny's two leased ATR aircraft, which will replace the Embraer capacity, is scheduled to enter service at the end of May 2024, and the second aircraft is scheduled to enter service during August 2024 after being scheduled for December 2024.\"\n'Wholly regrettable'\nIn the letter to deputies Mr Bezuidenhout stated \"the service disruptions experienced in quarter one of 2024 did not relate to new routes being launched, nor has it been a consequent to Aurigny's fleet transition\".\n\"Whilst the recent service reliability challenges on its UK network have been wholly regrettable, Aurigny did increase the number of flights delivered, and the number of passengers carried, relative to the record volumes achieved over the comparative period last year,\" he wrote.\nSome of the issues which Aurigny saw were blamed by Mr Bezuidenhout on corrosion being found in the thrust-reversers - which provide deceleration - of Aurigny's Embraer 195 aircraft, which the CEO said \"resulted in the aircraft's immediate grounding\".\nThe company worked with Eastern Airways after these issues were identified to provide \"standby capacity\".\nMr Bezuidenhout said: \"Eastern Airways failed to deliver the services as contracted, which severely compromised Aurigny's ability to respond to the unforeseen weather and technical challenges during February and March 2024.\n\"The contract with Eastern Airways has been terminated.\"\nEastern Airways has been contacted for comment.\n'Falling short'\nAlan Sillett, the president of Guernsey Hospitality Association, said from his point of view it was \"about reliability, resilience, cost and competition\" and said Aurigny appeared \"to be falling short on all counts\".\n\"The GHA wants and needs Aurigny to succeed, which is why we are calling on its chief executive Nico Bezuidenhout to assure his passengers now that they will be free of major disruption for the rest of the year,\" he said.\n\"If he can't or won't do that, then we can all draw our own conclusions about the quality of service he's providing.\"\nAurigny said it would not comment on Mr Sillet's views.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook .

    "North Korea's state television channel has censored a BBC gardening programme - by blurring out presenter Alan Titchmarsh's trousers.\nCentral TV aired a 2010 edition of Alan Titchmarsh's Garden Secrets for its morning audience, but made sure that viewers could not see his jeans.\nJeans are seen as a symbol of western imperialism in the secretive state and as such are banned.\nMr Titchmarsh said the news has given him \"a bit of street cred\".\n\"It's taken me to reach the age of 74 to be regarded in the same sort of breath as Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Rod Stewart. You know wearing trousers that are generally considered by those of us of a sensitive disposition to be rather too tight,\" he told the BBC.\nHe then went on to say that his jeans were not too tight, but were clearly not acceptable in North Korea.\nHe said: \"I've never seen myself as a dangerous subversive imperialist - I'm generally regarded as rather cosy and pretty harmless, so actually it's given me a bit of street cred really hasn't it?\"\nNorth Korea's rules prohibiting jeans have been in place since the 1990s.\nBack then, leader Kim Jong-il declared denim trousers to be a symbol of Western - and specifically American - imperialism, which had no place in a socialist state, according to Seoul-based NK News .\nIn recent years, a crackdown on Western culture has reiterated this ban, with state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun telling citizens in 2020 to reject what it termed \"bourgeois culture\" in favour of a \"superior socialist lifestyle\".\nCurrent leader Kim Jong-un, himself a fan of voluminous legwear, is reportedly irked by skinny jeans and T-shirts bearing Western logos which are popular in South Korea.\nHow did North Korea get hold of a BBC programme?\nWestern programming is extremely rare on North Korean screens, as the regime is careful - to the point of paranoia - about allowing foreign culture to enter the country.\nYet this is not the first time Garden Secrets has been aired before on Central TV, with Mr Titchmarsh saying he was \"surprised\" to appear on screens in the Communist state.\nBut it is still not entirely clear how it arrived in North Korea in the first place.\nWhile satellite dishes and access to the global internet are banned except for the very few trusted classes in Pyongyang, foreign media still arrives in the country, often on memory cards smuggled over the Chinese border. Owning or trading in foreign media is illegal.\nHowever, North Korean TV often pirates content from foreign broadcasters, blurring out onscreen logos to hide the original source.\nThis is often the case with their airing of Premier League, Champions League, and International football.\nIn 2014, during one of North Korea's periods of connecting with the West, there were discussions suggesting possibly gifting UK television programmes to the East Asian state as a means of demonstrating so-called \"soft-power\".\nThe Sunday Times revealed in 2014 that BBC Worldwide - the former name of the corporation's commercial arm BBC Studios - and the Foreign Office were hoping to \"open [the North Korean] people's eyes to the world beyond the closed republic without offending the regime\".\nThe paper quoted a Whitehall official as saying: \"Programmes sent to North Korea would have to be something that isn't offensive, like Mr Bean, EastEnders, Miss Marple or Poirot.\n\"You couldn't send Dad's Army, as it is about war. But Teletubbies could be an option, or The Good Life, with a bit of gardening and squabbling in the kitchen\".\nIt's not known if Alan Titchmarsh's Garden Secrets was part of this package, or even if the programmes were delivered at all.",

    "The reverberations from the closure of one of the UK's last royal shipyards 40 years ago are still being felt.\nOn 31 March 1984 more than 7,000 skilled workers at Chatham Dockyard lost their jobs, as well as another 10,000 people in supporting industries.\nWith them went the Kent town's long history of building, repairing and supplying ships for the Royal Navy.\nA shocking blow at the time, but some now say the site has reinvented itself \"like a phoenix rising from the ashes\".\nKing Charles III, who served in a warship based in Chatham, recently described the dockyard's closure as \"a profound challenge\".\nThere had been a dockyard in the Kent town for 400 years. Nelson's HMS Victory was built there.\nMore than 400 ships were constructed in Chatham, from wooden fighting sailing ships and the age of iron and steam, to 20th Century destroyers and submarines.\nAt its height during World War Two the dockyard employed 17,000 workers from more than 26 different trades across 700 acres.\nAt the time of closure in 1984 there were 7,300 people employed on site.\nA total of 2,300 received compulsory redundancy, 2,000 were transferred to other naval dockyards, 1,500 retired and 1,500 took voluntary redundancy.\nChatham Dockyard closed as a result of a defence review by the government of Margaret Thatcher which was aimed at reducing expenditure during the early 1980s recession.\nRichard Holdsworth, dockyard historian, said 1984 was a pivotal moment for the site.\nHe said: \"When I arrived this was virtually a dead site. The dockyard really was the purpose for Chatham.\n\"It developed from being a fishing village primarily because the dockyard was there.\"\nHe added: \"It was a naval town. And the navy left. Chatham was in shock for a very long time.\"\nMr Holdsworth is former heritage director at the Historic Dockyard, the tourist attraction which moved in when the shipyard closed.\nThe site of the old naval base was split. It now includes a tourist attraction, a working port, a large housing development, a university complex and a shopping outlet.\nThe Historic Dockyard Chatham is now one of Kent's largest tourist attractions.\nIt is made up of more than 100 buildings and structures, 47 of which are scheduled as ancient monuments, plus three historical warships in dry docks.\nMr Holdsworth said: \"An awful lot of highly-skilled people took their redundancy and set up small to medium size enterprise companies nearby.\"\n\"It has been a phoenix that has risen from the ashes. It's very different now.\n\"In terms of regeneration the job has been done several times over.\"\nFrom shipbuilders to volunteer tour guides\n\"Looking back on it, I loved it,\" said John de Rose, who became an apprentice shipwright at Chatham aged 16 in 1962.\n\"We had a good navy. And Chatham was fully used to fit those ships.\n\"When it closed I thought 'what am I going to do now?'\"\nTony Peacock, another apprentice shipwright who joined in 1968, said: \"We had a lot of laughs. It was so sad when it closed.\"\nBoth men are back at the dockyard as volunteers, helping visitors in the site's photo library and taking round tour parties.\nMr de Rose said: \"I love the dockyard. And telling kids about it.\"\nMr Peacock added: \"I have a lot of memories. It was a great place to work.\"\nKeeping traditional skills alive\nAlex Rowling, the managing director of Master Ropemakers, has a proud boast.\n\"We make enough rope every year to reach the moon!\" Ms Rowling said.\nHer company helps keep the traditional skill of ropemaking alive inside the Historic Dockyard.\nThe ropery is a quarter of a mile-long building where naval rope has been made commercially since 1618.\nMs Rowling added: \"We are here primarily to educate. But the rope we make is sold around the world.\"\nLeanne Clark learned her craft from Fred Cordier, the last master ropemaker at the dockyard before it closed.\nShe said: \"It's not exactly the kind of thing you get at job fairs.\n\"It's living history - keeping something alive using Victorian equipment.\n\"I genuinely love me job.\"\nLights! Camera! Action!\nThe dockyard's authentic cobbled streets, industrial buildings and Georgian and Victorian architecture have regularly been the backdrop for film and television productions.\nThe site has been a filming location for blockbuster Hollywood movies, like Sherlock Holmes, Les Mis\u00c3\u00a9rables and Mission: Impossible, and also popular television dramas, such as the BBC's Call The Midwife.\nOlivia Horner, director of commercial operations, has overseen all those productions.\nShe said: \"We have been welcoming film crews for 40 years now. All the income generated goes back into supporting us as a charity.\n\"We've had around 15,000 people come on our Call The Midwife tour mainly because we are the iconic location where it is filmed.\"\n\"The biggest attraction we offer is our backdrop.

    "A Cadbury store has been criticised by a Christian campaign group for advertising chocolate Easter eggs as \"gesture\" eggs.\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph , the shop in Springfields Outlet in Spalding, Lincolnshire, was offering a two for \u00c2\u00a310 deal on the \"gesture\" eggs.\nCadbury's owners said it had \"no involvement\" in the promotion. The BBC has approached the store for comment.\nChristian Concern said people were \"overly worried about offending\".\nMondelez International, which owns Cadbury, said it had licensed the brand to Freshstores Limited, which runs the Cadbury discount store \"completely independently\".\nIn a statement, Mondelez International said: \"This promotion is not Cadbury led and we had no involvement in any way. All Cadbury Easter shell eggs sold in the UK reference Easter very clearly on the packaging - sometimes multiple times.\n\"Cadbury has used the word Easter in our marketing and communications for over 100 years and continue to do so with our new Easter product range. To claim anything otherwise is factually incorrect.\nThe firm added: \"We have contacted Freshstore, the independent retailer who put up this poster in a very limited number of stores, and we understand they will be taking these posters down.\"\n'Very odd'\nTim Dieppe, the head of public policy at Christian Concern, said Easter eggs were a \"clear symbol of the Easter story\".\nHe added: \"It seems very odd that someone would want to try and separate Easter from eggs. Once you do that, you lose the meaning of the eggs.\"\nMr Dieppe accused the store of trying to \"erase the connection between Easter and eggs\".\nAsked what he thought what behind the advertising, Mr Dieppe said: \"People are overly worried about offending.\"\nHe insisted he was not offended, but added: \"I am more surprised. Why would you not just say Easter egg?\"\nNobody from the store would comment. The BBC has contacted representatives of Freshstores Limited for comment.\nOn Wednesday morning, a BBC reporter visited the store and saw a sign advertising two Easter eggs for \u00c2\u00a310, with no reference to \"gesture\" eggs.\nIt is not the first time Cadbury has been criticised for omitting the word \"Easter\" in its marketing.In 2017, a row erupted after a National Trust Easter egg trail, sponsored by Cadbury, was renamed the Great British Egg Hunt .At the time, it prompted the Church of England to accuse the National Trust and Cadbury of \"airbrushing faith\".\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) , and Instagram .

    "Teenage Afghan girls have told the BBC they feel \"mentally dead\" as the Taliban's ban on their education prevents them from returning to school once again.\nMore than 900 days have now passed since girls over 12 were first banned.\nThe Taliban have repeatedly promised they would be readmitted once a number of issues were resolved - including ensuring the curriculum was \"Islamic\".\nBut they have made little comment as a third new school year started without teenage girls in class this week.\nThe BBC has asked the Taliban's education minister for an explanation, but he has so far not responded. The Taliban's chief spokesman told local TV there had been \"some problems and shortcomings for different reasons\" in getting the ban lifted.\nAccording to Unicef, the ban has now impacted some 1.4m Afghan girls - among them, former classmates Habiba, Mahtab and Tamana, who spoke to the BBC last year.\nThe hope they described 12 months ago is still there, but seems to have dwindled.\n\"In reality, when we think, we don't live, we are just alive,\" Mahtab, 16, says. \"Think of us like a moving dead body in Afghanistan.\"\nTamana - who dreams of a PhD - agrees. \"I mean, we are physically alive but mentally dead,\" she says.\nGirls were first singled out and prevented from going to secondary school back in September 2021 - a month after the Taliban took control of the country.\nActing Deputy Education Minister Abdul Hakim Hemat later told the BBC that girls would not be allowed to attend secondary school until a new education policy in line with Islamic and Afghan traditions was approved, which would be in time for the start of school in March 2022.\nTwo years later, Zainab - not her real name - is among the 330,000 girls Unicef estimates should have started secondary school this March. She had held onto hope that she and fellow girls in Grade Six would be able to continue, up to the point her headmaster entered the exam hall to explain they would not be able to return for the new term.\nZainab had been top of her class. Now, she tells the BBC: \"I feel like I have buried my dreams in a dark hole.\"\nZainab's father has attempted to leave Afghanistan, but so far without success. Officially, Zainab's only option is classes at government-controlled religious schools, or madrassas - something the family do not want.\n\"It is not an alternative to school,\" her father says. \"They will only teach her religious subjects.\"\nFor now, she attends an English class being quietly run in her neighbourhood - one of many which have quietly emerged in defiance of the ban in the last few years. Girls have also been able to keep up their studies by following courses online, or watching programmes like BBC Dars - an education programme for Afghan children, including girls aged 11-16 barred from school, described as a \"learning lifeline\" by the United Nations last year.\nWhere to find Dars\nBut Zainab and girls like her are among the more fortunate ones. When families are struggling to get enough to eat - as many in Afghanistan are - accessing online education is simply not seen \"as a priority for their daughters\", notes Samira Hamidi, Amnesty International's regional campaigner.\nThe future for many of Afghanistan's girls is \"bleak\", she warns - pointing to the fact young girls are continuing to be married off when they reach puberty, and are further endangered by the Taliban's rollback of laws designed to protect women in abusive marriages.\nAnd it is not just 13-year-olds being prevented from accessing an education. The BBC has found the ban even being extended to younger girls if they appear to have gone through puberty.\nNaya, not her real name, is just 11 but is no longer attending school in her home province of Kandahar. Her father says the government has \"abandoned\" her because she looks older than she is.\n\"She is larger than average, and that was the reason the government told us she couldn't go to school. She must wear the veil (hijab) and stay at home.\"\nHe doesn't hold out much hope for the rules changing under the current regime, but was keen to stress one point: the idea the people of Afghanistan backed the Taliban's ban was an \"absolute lie\".\n\"It is absolutely an accusation on Afghans and Pashtuns that they don't want daughter's education, but the issue is vice-versa,\" he said. \"Specially in Kandahar and other Pashtun provinces (where Pashtun people live), a lot people are ready to send their daughters to schools and universities to get education.\"\nThe ban on a secondary education is far from the only change these girls are facing, however. In December 2022, women were told they could no longer attend university. Then there were the rules restricting how far a woman could travel without a male relative, on how they dressed, what jobs they could do, and even a ban on visiting their local parks.\nThere are hopes, says Amnesty's Samira Hamidi, that the secret schools and online education \"can be expanded\". But, she added: \"In a country with over one million gir",

    "A container ship has crashed into the landmark Francis Scott Key Bridge near the US city of Baltimore, causing most of it to collapse.\nSeveral vehicles on the bridge at the time plunged into the waters of the River Patapsco. Hours later, the Coast Guard said at least six people were presumed dead.\nThe Port of Baltimore remains closed to ships and President Joe Biden vowed the federal government will cover \"the entire cost\" of rebuilding the bridge.\nOn Wednesday, investigators boarded the stricken ship and recovered its data recorder which they hope may explain the catastrophic power failure that caused it to go off course.\nWhat do we know about the bridge?\nThe Baltimore bridge, known more simply as the Key Bridge, was opened in 1977 in honour of Francis Scott Key, a 19th Century Maryland poet who wrote the words for the US national anthem, the Star Spangled Banner.\nThe bridge was 1.6 miles (2.6km) long and spanned the Patapsco River and Baltimore harbour. The river flows out into Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the US.\nIt is described as a continuous truss bridge, and its main span of 1,200ft was the third longest of any bridge of its type in the world.\nVideo footage from the incident appears to show the bridge collapsing instantaneously after the container ship Dali hits one of its pillars. This happened at around 01:30 local time (05:30 GMT) on Tuesday.\nEight people - all part of a construction crew contracted to fix potholes and make repairs - were seen on the bridge at the time.\nTwo of the workers are from Guatemala, according to the country's consulate in Maryland.\nTwo people were pulled from the water after the bridge collapsed, one in a serious condition and one apparently uninjured, officials said.\nBut six others likely perished due to cold water temperatures and hours spent under the surface, the US Coast Guard said on Tuesday evening. The agency said it was suspending its major search and rescue operation that lasted all day.\nIt will now focus on a recovery mission to locate bodies and bring closure to families of the victims.\nOfficials say first responders worked in treacherous conditions to try to find the men, as there were \"some cargo or retainers hanging from the bridge\" as well as dangerous debris in the water.\nThe water temperature in the harbour was said to be about 9C (48F). Hypothermia can occur when a person's body temperature drops below 35C.\nBaltimore fire officials said vehicles had been detected in the water by sonar.\nWhat do we know about the ship?\nThe Singapore-flagged container ship Dali was originally built for Greek shipowner Oceanbulk by South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries.\nIt is currently operated by the charter vessel company Synergy Group and had been temporarily leased by container shipping giant Maersk, a Maersk statement said.\nMaersk added that it was carrying cargo for Maersk customers but that no company personnel were on board at the time.\nThe ship set off from Baltimore's Seagirt Marine Terminal at around 00:24 local time on Tuesday, en route for Colombo, Sri Lanka.\nIts speed steadily increased and it maintained a straight route south east along the Patapsco River.\nThen at 01:25 MarineTraffic data shows that the ship suddenly diverted from its straight course and began to slow down.\nAround this time, video shows that all lights on the exterior of the ship suddenly went out and smoke began emanating from the ship's funnel.\nShortly afterwards it hit the bridge.\nA mayday signal was sent when the ship was approaching the bridge, which gave authorities time to stop cars driving onto the bridge and \"saved lives\", Governor Moore said.\nHe said the vessel had been moving at a \"very, very rapid\" eight knots, or roughly 9mph (15km/h).\nAn unclassified memo from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency obtained by the BBC's US partner CBS says the Dali had \"lost propulsion\".\nSynergy said the crew, who are all Indian nationals, and the two pilots, both US citizens from Baltimore, had all been accounted for and there were no reports of any injuries.\nThe company said there were several possible explanations for the incident but that, with two pilots present, such a crash was unusual.\nA shipping expert told the BBC that the crash could have been caused by engine failure, steering failure or generator blackout.\nThis is not the first incident involving the Dali.\nWhile attempting to leave the Belgian port of Antwerp in 2016 the ship scraped its stern along the quay damaging the hull . There were no reports of injuries or spillages.\nThe Dali was flagged with Singapore in October 2016. the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPAS) says.\nCertificates covering the structural integrity of the vessel and functionality of the vessel's equipment were valid at the time of the incident, according to the MPAS.\nThe vessel underwent and passed two separate foreign port state inspections in June and September 2023, the authority adds.

    "Concern about artificial intelligence (AI) wrecking elections and threatening democracy has reached fever pitch.\nEach week sees a new set of warnings about the potential impact of AI-generated deepfakes - realistic video and audio of politicians saying things they never said - spreading confusion and mistrust among the voting public.\nAnd in the UK, regulators, security services and government are battling to protect this year's general election from malign foreign interference.\nLess attention has been given to the possible benefits of AI.\nBut a lot of work is going on, often below the radar, to try to harness its power in ways that might enhance democracy rather than destroy it.\n\"While this technology does pose some important risks in terms of disinformation, it also offers some significant opportunities for campaigns, which we can't ignore,\" Hannah O'Rourke, co-founder of Campaign Lab , a left-leaning network of tech volunteers, says.\n\"Like all technology, what matters is how AI is actually implemented.\n\"Its impact will be felt in the way campaigners actually use it.\"\nWorrying tendency\nAmong other things, Campaign Lab runs training courses for Labour and Liberal Democrat campaigners on how to use ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to create the first draft of election leaflets.\nIt reminds them to edit the final product carefully, though, as large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have a worrying tendency to \"hallucinate\" or make things up.\nThe group is also experimenting with chatbots to help train canvassers to have more engaging conversations on the doorstep.\nAI is already embedded in everyday programs, from Microsoft Outlook to Adobe Photoshop, Ms O'Rourke says, so why not use it in a responsible way to free up time for more face-to-face campaigning?\n\"AI-generated misinformation simply doesn't work when politicians have proper relationships with the voters and the communities they represent, when they actually deliver on what they promise.\n\"You can't fake that a local park someone passes everyday has been cleaned up, just as you can't fake a conversation on a doorstep.\"\nConservative-supporting AI expert Joe Reeve is another young political campaigner convinced the new technology can transform things for the better.\nHe runs Future London , a community of \"techno optimists\" who use AI to seek answers to big questions such as \"Why can't I buy a house?\" and, crucially, \"Where's my robot butler?\"\nIn 2020, Mr Reeve founded Tory Techs, partly as a right-wing response to Campaign Lab.\nThe group has run programming sessions and explored how to use AI to hone Tory campaign messages but, Mr Reeve says, it now \"mostly focuses on speaking with MPs in more private and safe spaces to help coach politicians on what AI means and how it can be a positive force\".\n\"Technology has an opportunity to make the world a lot better for a lot of people and that is regardless of politics,\" he tells BBC News.\n'New fangled'\nThe UK has already seen its first - and maybe the world's first - AI-powered election candidate.\nAndrew Gray was roundly rejected by voters in July's Selby and Ainsty by-election, gaining just 99 votes.\nIt was a bruising experience for the former lawyer, who stood as an independent candidate \"powered by AI\", with hopes of causing a political earthquake.\nBut voters in the rural North Yorkshire constituency were not ready for such a \"new fangled\" concept, he says, and were often just confused by it.\n\"When constituents messaged me, they often thought I was a bot.\"\nMr Gray's campaign was based on Polis, an AI-powered tool that allows groups with widely different opinions to reach a consensus through votes and discussion.\nPolis first appeared on the political radar when it was used by Taiwan's government to settle controversial questions, such as the legality of e-scooters.\nMr Gray used it to crowdsource a \"people's manifesto\" for Selby and Ainsty and planned to use it to consult constituents on which way to vote in the House of Commons.\nHe remains a firm believer in the power of Polis to bridge political divides and bring people together but says it may be better suited to solving local controversies, rather than tackling major national issues at Westminster, at least for now.\nMr Gray's not-for-profit organisation, Crowd Wisdom Project , has helped local councils, such as Wandsworth, in south London, which last year held a consultation on clean air , using Polis, to formulate policies.\nCritics will say Polis and other AI-assisted decision-making programs being marketed to local authorities are still open to being manipulated to produce results the results politicians want, like the bogus consultation exercises beloved by an earlier generation of leaders.\nBut the sheer power of AI technology - and its ability to crunch vast quantities of data - promises to offer far deeper insights into what constituents and voters are thinking and feeling.\n'Synthetic polls'\nJoe Twyman, co-founder of polling company",
    "A loophole allowing fly-tippers to advertise \"criminality\" online could be closed under a new law, an MP has said.\nPeterborough's Paul Bristow introduced his Disposal of Waste (Advertising and Penalty Provision) Bill to the House of Commons on Tuesday.\nHe said he was \"sick to death of the mindless idiots\" dumping rubbish on streets in Peterborough.\nThe bill would require the display of a valid waste transfer licence for all removal advertisements.\n\"Winning the war on fly-tipping is a daunting challenge, but it is one we cannot afford to ignore,\" said Mr Bristow, Conservative.\n\"Through this Bill we will close the loopholes that allow fly-tippers to advertise their criminality online, and we will force local authorities to fine perpetrators on both public and private land.\n\"We need a zero-tolerance approach to end this scourge.\"\nThe MP told the Commons the bill \"would help people not to unwittingly use illegal operators and unintentionally contribute to the scourge of fly-tipping\".\nMr Bristow asked for his bill to be considered at second reading on 17 May, although it is unlikely to become law in its current form due to a lack of parliamentary time.\nMore than one million fly-tipping incidents were recorded in England in the year ending March 2022 , which was an increase compared with the pre-pandemic figure of 980,000 for the 12 months ending in March 2020.\nThe Labour Party has previously suggested forcing fly-tippers to remove litter on the streets as part of so-called \"clean-up squads\".\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Climate change is affecting the speed of the Earth's rotation and could impact how we keep time, a study says.\nAccelerating melt from Greenland and Antarctica is adding extra water to the world's seas, redistributing mass.\nThat is very slightly slowing the Earth's rotation. But the planet is still spinning faster than it used to.\nThe effect is that global timekeepers may need to subtract a second from our clocks later than would otherwise have been the case.\n\"Global warming is already affecting global timekeeping,\" says the study, published in the journal Nature .\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC) - which is used by most of the world to regulate clocks and time - is calculated by the Earth's rotation.\nBut the Earth's rotation rate is not constant and can therefore have an effect on how long our days and nights are.\nChanges to the planet's liquid core have meant the Earth has been spinning slightly quicker.\nSince the 1970s, to correct for this, about 27 leap seconds have been added to the global clock, with timekeepers planning on subtracting a second for the first time in 2026. This is known as a \"negative leap second.\"\nHowever, the study finds that ice melt caused by climate change has partly offset that acceleration.\nIce sheets are now losing mass five times faster than they were 30 years ago , meaning that the negative leap second change will not be needed until 2029, the study suggests.\n\"It's kind of impressive, even to me, we've done something that measurably changes how fast the Earth rotates,\" Duncan Agnew, the author of the study, told NBC News.\n\"Things are happening that are unprecedented.\"\nThe negative leap second has never been used before and, according to the study, its use \"will pose an unprecedented problem\" for computer systems across the world.\n\"This has never happened before, and poses a major challenge to making sure that all parts of the global timing infrastructure show the same time,\" Mr Agnew, who is a researcher at the University of California, San Diego told AFP news agency.\n\"Many computer programs for leap seconds assume they are all positive, so these would have to be rewritten,\" he added.\nThere has been some scepticism of the study, however.\nDemetrios Matsakis, former chief scientist for time services at the US Naval Observatory, told AFP that \"Earth is too unpredictable to be sure\" if a negative leap second would be needed any time soon.\nHuman activities like burning fossil fuels are causing world temperatures to rise.\nThat temperature rise is having a huge effect on the environment, including the rapid melting of glaciers and ice sheets.",
    "The Princess of Wales says she is in the early stages of treatment after a cancer diagnosis.\nIn a video statement, Catherine says it was a \"huge shock\" after an \"incredibly tough couple of months\".\nBut she sent a positive message, saying: \"I am well and getting stronger every day.\"\nDetails of the cancer have not been disclosed, but Kensington Palace says it is confident the princess will make a full recovery.\nThe video statement from Catherine explains that when she had abdominal surgery in January, it was not known that there was any cancer.\n\"However tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment,\" said the princess.\nThe chemotherapy treatment began in late February. The palace says it will not be sharing any further private medical information, including the type of cancer.\nThe princess, 42, said she was thinking of all those who have been affected by cancer, adding: \"For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone.\"\nCatherine said recovery from her surgery in January, for a condition which has not been revealed, had taken time and the priority was now reassuring her family.\n\"William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.\"\nThe princess added: \"It has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be ok.\"\nShe said the family now needs \"some time, space and privacy\".\nThe King and Queen had been informed of the news about the princess's health prior to Friday's announcement - and King Charles himself has also been undergoing treatment for cancer.\nKing Charles and Catherine were briefly treated at the London Clinic private hospital at the same time - Catherine had her abdominal surgery there and the King was admitted for a \"corrective procedure\" for an enlarged prostate.\nA Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was \"so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did\".\nAfter their time in hospital together, he has \"remained in the closest contact with his beloved daughter-in-law throughout the past weeks\".\nPrince Harry and Meghan sent a message saying: \"We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace.\"\nCatherine and Prince William are now not expected to appear with the Royal Family on Easter Sunday, and there won't be any early return to official duties for the princess.\nKensington Palace also said Prince William's sudden absence from a memorial service on 27 February was because of the discovery of Catherine's cancer diagnosis.\nThe couple have faced intense public speculation and a social media frenzy about her health, since her operation in January. She has not attended any official events since Christmas.\nIn her video statement, she spoke about the support from her family: \"Having William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance too.\n\"As is the love, support and kindness that has been shown by so many of you. It means so much to us both.\"\nKensington Palace said the video of the princess was filmed on Wednesday by BBC Studios, the production arm of the BBC.\nIn a statement, BBC News said: \"Along with other media, BBC News was briefed by Kensington Palace on the announcement this afternoon.\"\nThere have been calls for privacy from the palace after weeks of speculation and conspiracy theories about the royal couple.\nThis had intensified after the withdrawal by photo agencies of a photograph of the princess for Mother's Day, on 10 March, because of concerns over digital alterations, for which the princess subsequently apologised.\nThere were also social media theories over video footage showing Prince William and Catherine shopping in Windsor earlier this week.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday Catherine had shown \"tremendous bravery\" with her statement, wishing her a \"speedy recovery\".\nHe said: \"In recent weeks she has been subjected to intense scrutiny and has been unfairly treated by certain sections of the media around the world and on social media.\n\"When it comes to matters of health, like everyone else, she must be afforded the privacy to focus on her treatment and be with her loving family.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his thoughts were with the Royal Family, adding he was \"heartened\" by Catherine's \"optimistic tone and her message of faith and hope\".\nHe said: \"Any cancer diagnosis is shocking. But I can only imagine the added stress of receiving that news amid the lurid speculation we've seen in recent weeks.\"\nWilliam and Catherine are \"entitled to privacy and, like any parents, will have waited to choose the right moment to tell their children\".\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was joinin",

    "A man accused of the manslaughter of his newborn daughter previously admitted harming her only to receive a lesser sentence, a court has heard.\nIt is alleged Stephen Niland, 41 and of Holyrood Road in Doncaster, shook his daughter Molly in October 2005.\nThe following year he pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm but has now told Sheffield Crown Court he was innocent.\nMolly died from brain damage in 2020 and Mr Niland denies her manslaughter.\nSheffield Crown Court previously heard how Mr Niland, then 22, had been alone with his 12-week-old daughter on the morning of 19 October 2005.\nMr Niland said he had difficulty feeding Molly that day and said she was crying for around 15 minutes before he briefly left her on a mat to go to the bathroom.\nHe said when he returned, he could tell something was wrong as Molly was \"crying in pain\" and her eyes were purple.\nProsecutor Dafydd Huw Enoch KC accused Mr Niland of trying to give the impression something had happened to his daughter while he left her unattended.\n'Overwhelmed and frustrated'\nInstead, Mr Enoch alleged that Mr Niland, a \"very young and inexperienced father\", had been \"overwhelmed\" and became \"frustrated\" when Molly would not feed or stop crying.\n\"Mr Niland, we say, must've momentarily lost control and shaken her very vigorously,\" Mr Enoch told jurors.\n\"And in those moments he altered the path of his life and of Molly's. The sad truth is that he killed her, although she wasn't to die until 2020.\"\nMr Enoch said when Molly went to hospital that day, she had catastrophic injuries involving bleeding on the brain, spinal bleeding, retinal bleeding and brain damage from a lack of oxygen.\nMr Niland denied inflicting any injuries on his daughter and said \"something very serious had already been wrong with her\".\nHe told jurors: \"I don't know what happened to her to this day.\"\nDefending Mr Niland on Monday, Anya Lewis KC said Molly had been taken to hospital and was seen by GPs in the lead-up to 19 October as her parents had been worried about her.\nShe said concerns had been expressed about Molly having a cough and generally being \"off\" that week.\nMs Lewis told jurors it was the defendant's case that Molly's injuries were caused by complications at birth or an unidentified non-traumatic cause.\nMs Lewis highlighted the controversy surrounding shaken baby syndrome and said evidence from Prof Christopher Milroy confirmed the three tell-tale signs of abusive head trauma - called the triad - were based on a diagnosis of exclusion.\nThe court heard the presence of the three signs - namely retinal bleeding, subdural hematoma and brain damage - should not be regarded as proof of shaken baby syndrome and this area of forensic neuropathology was still widely debated among experts.\n'He felt hopeless, helpless'\nMs Lewis told the court no other external or historic injuries were found on Molly and there had been no history of violence in the family.\nShe said Mr Niland had been regarded as \"loving\" and \"gentle\" and had only pleaded guilty to causing Molly grievous bodily harm in 2006 based on legal advice he received at the time.\nThe jury heard Mr Niland's barrister, who had since died, told him in 2006 medical evidence was stacked up against him but a guilty plea could see him reunited with his family sooner.\nMs Lewis said: \"Why did he not fight? Maybe because he felt hopeless, helpless.\n\"Because you think you have no chance and the best thing you can do is to minimise the damage so that you can get on with your life.\"\nShe said Mr Niland did not hurt his daughter and was not guilty of manslaughter.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Volunteers in County Tyrone have raised concerns after spending weeks removing a river blockage they said was \"half the size of a football pitch\".\nAt the beginning of March, trees fell into the Tyrone side of the River Blackwater and waste and sludge got caught in the debris.\nLocal people feared that search and rescue boats could be prevented from accessing Lough Neagh.\nGovernment bodies said they did not have responsibility to clear the river.\nNew figures show there have been more than 7,000 waste dumping and water pollution incidents in Northern Ireland since 2019.\nThe River Blackwater river runs along the Armagh-Tyrone border to Lough Neagh and is one of Northern Ireland's most polluted rivers.\nBrian MacAuley, chair of the Inland Waterways Association's Blackwater Branch, helped organise a clear-up on the river.\nHe believes it shouldn't be left to the local community to solve the problem.\nHe added: \"The blockage was about half the size of a football pitch, it was huge, but we've found that most government agencies aren't interested. Every department says it's somebody else's problem and we've been caught in the middle.\n\"In their frustration the community have rallied together to fix this problem themselves; every single person who has helped clear this blockage is a volunteer.\"\nCriticism\nThe Blackwater is one of six major rivers that feed into Lough Neagh, where, last year, blue-green algal blooms could be seen from space .\nAt a meeting of Mid Ulster District Council on 22 March 2024, government departments were criticised over the blockage at the River Blackwater.\nChairman Dominic Molloy claimed that \"lives were being put at risk\" as a result of a lack of action, and that ordinary citizens were left with no choice but to step in to clear blockages themselves.\nThe Department for Infrastructure (DfI) told BBC News NI that it only undertakes works on rivers to \"maintain the watercourse in a free-flowing condition to facilitate drainage outlets and reduce the risk to life and property from flooding\".\nA spokesperson added it did not have responsibility to clear blockages or maintain any river channel for \"navigation purposes\".\nThe Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) also said it did not have responsibility to clear blockages or to maintain any river channel, such as the Blackwater, for navigation purposes.\nA spokesperson added that it supports community groups to deliver improvements to waterways through its Environment Fund.\nHowever, Brian MacAuley said he was in \"no doubt this could happen again\" and called for urgent, preventative measures.\n\"So whether that's the agriculture or the infrastructure ministers, or both, we need a joined-up strategy to create a solution, particularly on the river banks.\"\nAgriculture Minister Andrew Muir has previously said that investment and proper enforcement was the best way to tackle the problem of water pollution.\nOn Thursday, clean water campaigner Feargal Sharkey said the situation was a \"shambles\".\nSpeaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, the former Undertones frontman called for a new independent arms-length body to properly manage water pollution in Northern Ireland.\n\"The simple truth of the matter is, politics stepped aside and allowed the water company and indeed agriculture to destroy the environment and the rivers and the water bodies.\"\n\"Deara has proved it's simply not up to the task. It needs to set up an independent regulator charged with, properly funded and resourced, to go out there and ensure the law is complied with.\"\nPollution\nIssues on the River Blackwater come as BBC News NI has obtained new figures showing the extent of dumping and water pollution incidents in Northern Ireland between 2019 and 2023.\nThe figures were released through a Freedom of Information request to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA).\nThe farming industry was the source of the most pollution incidents.\nThe Ulster Farmers' Union said that dedicating resources to the prevention of pollution was the key.\nA UFU spokesperson added: \"We recognise that certain farming practices can impact water quality but there are a significant range of schemes and regulations in place in Northern Ireland to address this.\"\nNI Water (NIW) was also responsible for almost 500 pollution incidents.\nA spokesperson said the majority were \"low severity\" due to sewer blockages from inappropriate items being flushed down the toilet.\nEarlier this week, a report by the Northern Ireland Audit Office found a quarter of water pollution incidents in 2022 were linked to the agricultural sector.\nThe majority of incidents were in the River Blackwater area with farm effluent, silage and cattle waste most frequently detected.\nThe NIEA said it takes it responsibilities on waste dumping and water pollution incidents seriously.\nA spokesperson added: \"NIEA will investigate and take appropriate action depending on the significance of the offence.

    "The BBC's director general Tim Davie has announced that the corporation will explore how to reform the licence fee.\nDavie said the BBC will look at the licence fee's scope, how progressive it is and how it is enforced.\nIn a speech on Tuesday, Davie said \"it is right to ask fundamental questions about its longevity\".\nBut he added \"we should be... cautious about unpicking a multi-genre BBC that leads the market\", describing the BBC as a \"precious ecosystem\".\nSpeaking of funding, Davie said the BBC's income had effectively fallen by around 30% between 2010 and 2020 and that the annual savings target would now rise by \u00c2\u00a3200m to \u00c2\u00a3700m a year by 2028.\nHe said that saving would ensure \"we can deliver enough impactful content and ensure investment in digital products\".\nDavie also said the long term funding of the BBC World Service - an international news service available on radio, television and online in English and 40 other languages - ought to be paid for by the government.\nThe cost of the World Service was paid for by the Foreign Office until 2014.  Since then there have been varying levels of grant support from the government, but it is at the moment largely paid for by the licence fee.\n\"We cannot keep asking UK licence fee payers to invest in it when we face cuts to UK services,\" he said.\nThe director general also criticised cuts to the BBC in real terms in recent years, including a two-year freeze on the licence fee.\n\"To strip money from the BBC during this period has been particularly short-sighted\" after \"below inflationary settlements have chipped away at our income over many years.\"\nHe added that the BBC was still highly valued: \"When I travel abroad, and see what others aspire to, there is almost universal admiration for what we have achieved. It is so precious, utterly unmatched. Not perfect, but trusted from Belfast to Boston, from Kendal to Kyiv.\"\nHe also acknowleged that the BBC now has an inflation-linked agreement until the end of the current BBC Charter.\nIn a wide-ranging speech, Davie suggested the BBC would begin looking at ways of making the licence fee more affordable to people on lower incomes post-2028 and how it's applied and enforced.\nQuestions have previously been raised about whether non-payment of the licence fee is a serious enough issue to merit criminal prosecution.\nOn 1 April, the cost of a TV licence will rise by \u00c2\u00a310.50 per year to \u00c2\u00a3169.50. The BBC funds a free licence for any household where someone over 75 also receives the means-tested pension credit.\nDavie said the approach to reform needs to be careful and cautious and rejected the idea of the BBC being reduced to a paywalled subscription service, or abandoning the breadth of its programming.\n\"We should not create another commercial walled garden or a narrow BBC that provides a niche service for the most hardcore users. The very wonder of the BBC is that quality news sits next to genres such as drama and sport thus ensuring widespread usage.\"\nThe BBC review will look at the issue of making it fairer for those on low incomes but Davie said the corporation is committed to a \"universal fee where everyone has a stake in it.\"\nDavie said next year the broadcaster will \"open up our biggest-ever consultation process so the public can inform and drive the debate on the future of the BBC\".\nThe background to the speech is the wider question of where the BBC goes from here.\nTraditional viewing of scheduled television is in decline and the competitive landscape with players such as Netflix, Disney, TikTok and YouTube has transformed viewing habits.  The size, scope and funding of the BBC is reviewed by the government in a process called charter review and the next charter will have be agreed by the end of 2027.\nThis is an indication of how the BBC will argue for the continuation of its role and funding.\nMore streaming content\nExpanding on what he meant by the BBC exploring how \"progressive\" the licence fee is, Davie said: \"What I was signalling is as we look at the licence fee going into the future, you know what exactly it covers. It covers live television at the moment, etc, how many people get a free licence?\n\"All those things we should be open-minded about.\"\nMore resources will be moved out of programming on the broadcaster's traditional TV schedules, into content that will streamed.\nBBC Three will not commission programmes anymore, with shows commissioned by iPlayer instead as part of a digital first approach.\nLast week the government announced an expert panel who will advise it on how the BBC should be funded after the charter.\n\"Now is the time when we must make choices to rapidly modernise and invest in precious institutions like the BBC, or they will wither,\" he said.\nHe added that he was \"not defensive about the future\" and acknowledged that the \"market has changed hugely since the licence fee was introduced\".\nDavie said he also agrees with a politician who said the \"BBC does not have a god-given right to exist\", which is why",

I felt violated, I felt embarrassed - I hated myself for a really long time.\"\nJudge Christopher Morgan said the impact of the video was \"devastating\" and that Ms Harrison's life was \"changed forever\" as a result of its publication.\nHe said the victim had lost money due to Bear's criminal conduct, including losing work from brands and having to pay legal fees.\nBear's OnlyFans account had 1,061 subscribers when he uploaded the video on 8 November 2020, the judge was previously told.\nThis number had increased by 822 a month after the video, which could be viewed for $9.99 (\u00c2\u00a37.95), was published.\nProsecutor Andrew Bousfield told an earlier hearing: \"At this time [he uploaded the video] Mr Bear was pretending to be a billionaire on his Twitter account. His most valuable asset at that time was selling sex videos.\"\nFinancial investigator Laura Mackenzie added the defendant's bank account was overdrawn.\nBear, from Loughton, Essex, was jailed for 21 months in March 2023 after a jury found him guilty of voyeurism and disclosing private, sexual photographs and films.\nMs Mackenzie told an earlier hearing that she calculated the \u00c2\u00a322,305.46 based on fees paid by viewers and based on the amount of subscribers he gained.\nBear, who was supported by his father, appeared in court wearing a pink shirt with trousers and slippers.\nIn an earlier civil case , he was ordered to pay Ms Harrison \u00c2\u00a3207,900 in damages. However, the court heard none of that had yet been paid.\nJudge Morgan said that if the confiscation order of \u00c2\u00a322,305 was not paid within three months, and if Bear had not requested an extension, he faced nine months in prison.\nAddressing Bear, the judge said: \"For those who are imprisoned for not paying, they serve the whole term, not half, and the serving of the term doesn't mean the amount doesn't have to be paid.\n\"It remains a debt and an order that must be paid until it is.\"\nBear's criminal trial heard that although the sex was consensual, Ms Harrison was unaware the footage, captured by a CCTV camera in Bear's garden, was being shared more widely.\nSpeaking outside court after the hearing, Ms Harrison said: \"Nobody has the right to earn money from any crime but to earn so much from image-based sexual abuse is quite frankly abhorrent.\n\"I think it's important that anyone who commits this awful crime should be made to give any money they made back to the victim and also the judicial system, especially after a successful conviction.\"\nShe said she would give some of the money to charities \"who have supported me throughout this ordeal\".\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Public satisfaction with the NHS has dropped again, setting a new low recorded by the long-running British Social Attitudes survey.\nJust 24% said they were satisfied with the NHS in 2023, with waiting times and staff shortages the biggest concerns.\nThat is five percentage points down on last year and a drop from the 2010 high of 70% satisfaction.\nThe poll - the gold-standard measure of the public's view of the health service - has been running since 1983.\nMore than 3,000 people were polled by the National Centre for Social Research across England, Wales and Scotland in the autumn.\nHealth is devolved so it is up to each nation to decide on policies for the NHS.\nThe findings on the NHS, published by the Nuffield Trust and King's Fund think tanks, show once again that performance has deteriorated after a new record low was seen last year.\nIn total, since 2020, satisfaction has fallen by 29 percentage points.\nOf the core services, the public was least satisfied with A&E and dentistry.\nThe survey also showed satisfaction with social care had fallen to 13% - again the lowest since the survey began.\nThe major reasons for dissatisfaction were long waiting times, staffing shortages and lack of funding.\nWhen asked about government choices on tax and spending on the NHS, 48% backed increasing taxes and spending more on the NHS, but 42% preferred to keep taxes and spending the same and 6% backed reducing taxes and spending less.\nThose with the highest incomes were more likely to want to increase taxes and spend more.\n'I feel let down'\nSamuel Wilson, 45, who lives in Worthing, West Sussex, has been left unable to work due to mobility and pain problems following two hip replacements.\nHe is now awaiting further treatment. \"I can't walk very far without excruciating pain,\" he says.\n\"I feel let down. The NHS is there to help you, not make things worse. I feel they have treated me disdainfully. The nurses are polite, I've found, and even my surgeon.\n\"But they are not providing the level of care required. And they know they are not providing the level of care required but trying to deal with them is like banging your head against a brick wall.\"\nRory Deighton, the NHS Confederation's acute network director, said the figures \"reflect exactly how people are feeling\".\n\"Times are tough, it's hard for staff and I think people recognise that,\" he told BBC's Breakfast programme. \"We've had a really hard year.\"\nHe said the focus for NHS leaders in the next 12 to 24 months would be on improving GP and dental access, and cutting waiting lists.\nAs well as calling for increased spending on hospitals, GP surgeries and social care, Mr Deighton said there was a \"really strong link\" between industrial action and the size of waiting lists for elective treatments.\nJunior doctors in England have staged 10 walkouts since March last year in a row over pay and recently voted to continue strike action .\nJessica Morris, from the Nuffield Trust, said the findings were worrying.\n\"As we approach a general election, political parties should be frank and realistic about the challenges ahead of them if they are to turn this situation around. \u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00e2\u0080\u00af\n\"Despite such low levels of satisfaction, the public continue to back the principles underpinning the NHS.\n\"The public has not fallen out of love with the idea of a publicly funded, free-at-the-point-of-use NHS, but they are losing confidence that it will support them and their loved ones in the best possible way when they need it.\"\nThe Patients Association said it was \"dismayed\" by the survey results.\nAnd Royal College of Nursing general secretary Prof Pat Cullen said: \"Enough is enough\".\n\"Voters must now make NHS and care services the central issue of the general election,\" she said.\n\"An NHS that was once a world-leader is now treating patients in corridors, doorways, and store cupboards. The status quo has become intolerable.\"\nBut a spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care in England said progress was being made, with some signs that the waiting list was falling, while investment was being made in key areas, such as GPs.\n\"We are fully committed to a faster, simpler and fairer NHS, free at the point of need,\" he said.\nThe Scottish government said other research showed people in Scotland were more satisfied with the way the NHS was run than this survey suggested.\nA Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We recognise performance is not where it should be.

    "Eighteen years ago, Prof Ahmed Hankir was homeless and in the grip of a mental health crisis.\nToday he is an award-winning psychiatrist working in Ontario, Canada.\nHis prestigious roles in the UK include honorary visiting professor at Cardiff Medical School.\nBy sharing his personal experience of living with a mental health condition and professional viewpoint, he now has thousands of social media followers.\n\"There's a solace in shared experience,\" he said.\n\"If you share, you can make other people feel less alone and less disconnected and less ashamed.\"\nThis article contains references to suicide.\nProf Hankir was born in Belfast, raised in Dublin and England, and moved to Lebanon at the age of 12.\n\"It was during the aftermath of the brutal and bloody civil war... the walls of the buildings would have bullet holes on them,\" he said.\nHe was in Lebanon during the 1996 siege of Qana where more than 100 were killed and another 100 injured - one traumatic incident he experienced at that time would never leave him.\nHe recalled seeing a father returning home to see the building reduced to rubble and all his family killed.\n\"He was holding the dead body of his child in his arms,\" recalled Prof Hankir.\n\"I remember him crying inconsolably which kind of penetrated my soul. These memories continue to haunt me.\"\nWhen he was 17, he and his twin brother left their parents and returned to the UK.\nProf Hankir's dreams of going to medical school were dashed when he realised his qualifications gained in Lebanon would not get him into a UK university.\nHe also found he was considered an international student, so the cost of university tuition fees was prohibitive.\nHe began working in a kebab van where he experienced another traumatic event - a group of men beat a young man to death.\n\"They were about 20m away from the van... it was harrowing,\" he said.\n\"Nobody intervened, nobody did anything, everybody just watched it happen until we could hear the sirens.\"\nAt this point, the life he had hoped to create for himself felt completely out of reach.\n\"It was my dream to become a doctor and here I am serving kebabs on minimum wage, witnessing a homicide and people are asking me 'can you speak English?',\" he said.\nNext he worked as a janitor in the morning and stacked shelves at night, working up to 70 hours a week on minimum wage.\nThe following year he enrolled in sixth form college but continued to work full time.\nOn telling a member of college staff he wanted to become a doctor, he said she laughed in his face.\n\"She made me feel like I was this dirty little immigrant with delusions of grandeur,\" he said.\n\"She literally laughed and she said, to quote her verbatim, 'you can't get into medical school, it's too competitive, choose another course'.\"\nHe made it to medical school in Manchester but was badly missing his parents and struggling to balance working around his studies.\nAt this point, he began experiencing flashbacks and eventually reached breaking point.\n\"It was a major depressive disorder,\" he said.\n\"Pervasively low mood, thoughts and feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness and guilt, the ruminations, the inability to concentrate, having no energy, you can't even get out of bed, you've got no motivation and yeah, you feel suicidal.\n\"I was in a really bad state but I was just terrified of being sectioned and I was terrified of being admitted into a psychiatric ward.\"\nHe felt unable to get help.\n\"My perceptions of mental health and mental illness were influenced by my cultural background - we don't talk about mental health in the Middle East and North Africa, it's a taboo, heavily stigmatised,\" he added.\nIn 2006, he quit medical school.\n\"I was impoverished, I had nowhere to stay, I'm sleeping rough,\" he said.\nHe was sometimes able to sleep on a friend's sofa and for a short time stayed in a squat where one day he found a flatmate dead from a drug overdose.\n\"It was like one trauma after the other,\" he said.\nHe eventually sought help, was under a psychiatrist and gradually became strong enough to return to university.\n\"It was horrific and it was a slow, gradual and painful process to recovery,\" he said.\nThese days he considers himself someone who lives with a mental health condition but who has learnt resilience.\nLast year he was awarded a World Health Organization Director-General's Health Leaders Award .\nThe same year he was awarded the Caroline Flack Mental Health Hero Award in The Sun's Who Cares Wins Awards for sharing his own struggles with mental health.\n\"I'm mindful that if I don't take the necessary measures to protect my mental health and to prevent relapse it can happen,\" he said.\nHe said exercise, his Muslim faith and working on creative projects aimed at combating mental health stigma all helped him stay well.\nIn April his book, Breakthrough: A Story of Hope, Resilience and Mental Health Recovery, will be published.\nHe believes the only way to end mental health stigma is to speak up.\n\"Just saying this with conviction: '",

    "The Daily Telegraph says Rishi Sunak's decision to announce honours outside the usual New Year's or King's Birthday lists will fuel speculation about a possible summer election.\nThe paper says the move will be seen as an attempt to shore up support, before a possible vote in June or July - though it points out that Downing Street sources insist going to the ballot box in the autumn remains the aim.\nCyber-security experts tell the Times they have serious concerns about a multi-million pound deal for a Chinese company to supply a supercomputer to a government research agency. The Science and Technologies Facilities Council will, the paper says, install a \u00c2\u00a330m machine at its site in Hartree in Cheshire.\nThe paper notes that just days ago the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said Beijing had been behind a malicious attack on the Electoral Commission. A government spokesman tells the paper that the super-computer was procured following a robust process.\nThe Guardian leads on the order made by the International Court of Justice, for Israel to allow unimpeded delivery of food aid into Gaza. The paper describes the ruling as a \"significant\" legal rebuke to Israel's claim that it is not blocking aid - but it notes that Israel has said it needs to inspect every shipment to make none of the contents can benefit Hamas.\n\"Rayner on the Ropes\" is the Daily Mail's headline. The paper says Labour is under pressure to \"set out the truth\" about what tax advice Angela Rayner received about the sale of her council house a decade ago. She denies underpaying tax on a property she sold before becoming an MP.\nAlso focusing on Ms Rayner, the Times says she is under \"renewed pressure\" after Stockport Council said it would review suggestions she had committed electoral or tax fraud. The Times explains that a Conservative Party deputy chair James Daly wrote to Stockport Council asking it to investigate whether Ms Rayner had been misleading about her living arrangements. The council has told the paper it's \"reviewing the questions put to us\". Ms Rayner has insisted she has done nothing wrong.\nThe Daily Mirror says a government report will call for venues to be made safer against possible terror attacks following a campaign by the mother of one of the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing. The Home Office document is expected to propose that venue staff have counter-terror training, and that bosses carry out stringent risk analysis. Figen Murray - whose son Martyn Hett died in the attack in 2017 - tells the Mirror the move is a victory for her son's legacy.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "A UN human rights expert says she believes Israel has committed \"acts of genocide\" in Gaza.\nFrancesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, presented her report to UN member states in Geneva on Tuesday.\nBut Israel has already dismissed her findings.\nThis comes amid growing international pressure on Israel to stop the war or to do much more to protect civilians.\nMs Albanese concluded that \"there are reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold indicating the commission of the crime of genocide against Palestinians as a group in Gaza has been met\".\nBefore Ms Albanese even got to her feet, her findings had been dismissed by Israel, whose ambassador described it as \"an outrageous distortion of the Genocide Convention\".\nIsrael has for years been angered by the UN Human Rights Council's agenda, which permanently devotes an entire section - Item 7 - to scrutiny of the situation in \"Palestine and the other occupied Arab territories\".\nThe agenda item was approved not by the UN itself, but by UN member states, decades ago, and has never expired. No other country in the world has permanent scrutiny like this, and Israel views it as discriminatory, and aimed at delegitimising Israel. It refuses to attend the council when Item 7 is under discussion.\nBut many countries, in particular those in the Middle East, argue that the situation - in the absence of self-determination for Palestinians through a two-state solution - requires ongoing investigation, and now that there is another conflict, all the more so.\nSince Hamas's brutal attack on Israel on 7 October, Ms Albanese has called for the release of the hostages, and does so again in this report. In it she \"firmly condemns the crimes committed by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Israel on 7 October\".\nBut she has also been outspoken in her criticism of Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza.\n'Anatomy of a Genocide'\nThat's why her report has been awaited with both impatience, and trepidation.\nMs Albanese's choice of a title for it: 'Anatomy of a Genocide' was not exactly diplomatic. Many member states, especially those traditionally supportive of Israel, will be uncomfortable.\nBut UN special rapporteurs, while tasked by the UN to examine and advise on specific situations, are independent of it.\nGenocide is a specific legal term, and Ms Albanese's report suggests some of the legal criteria have been fulfilled.\nShe cites what she says appears to be Israel's intention to destroy Palestinians as a group \"in whole or in part\", a key clause in the Convention against Genocide.\nShe mentions in particular three elements which point to possible genocide:\nThe death toll in Gaza, currently well over 32,000 according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, the bombing of densely populated areas, and the restrictions on aid supplies (which, the UN says, have brought Gaza to the brink of famine), are all proof, the report claims, of intent to destroy the group.\nPalestinian welcome\nBasel Alsourani, of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, welcomed the report. He suggested international law had been violated by all sides in this conflict, but argued that genocide was such a serious crime the international community could not ignore it.\n\"Allowing genocide to happen doesn't only affect Palestinians\u00e2\u0080\u00a6, it affects all human beings around the world,\" he said.\n\"If now Israel is committing genocide without accountability, tomorrow we don't know which country will claim that genocide has been committed by Israel, and [therefore] I can commit genocide with no accountability.\"\nTala Nasir, a Palestinian human rights lawyer who also travelled to Geneva to hear the report, hoped it would draw more attention to the fate of what she said were thousands of people detained by Israel since 7 October.\n\"They have arrested more than 7,700 Palestinians,\" she said.\n\"Eighty per cent of them are being held under administrative detention which means they are not presenting any charges against them.\"\nTheir families, she pointed out, had no contact with them, and no idea where they were.\nIsrael anger\nNot surprisingly, Israeli diplomats are angry. Its ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Meirav Eilon Shahar, described the report as \"an obscene inversion of reality\", and accused Ms Albanese of questioning Israel's right to exist.\nMany Israelis, too, are likely to be shocked. And the suggestion of genocide, towards a state which was founded as a direct result of Nazi Germany's genocide of Jews, will cause deep offence.\nIn the wake of 7 October attack, and the fact that so many Israeli families are still waiting for news of loved ones taken hostage, hearing such outspoken condemnation is hard.\nNoam Peri, whose father Chaim was taken hostage, also travelled to Geneva.  Her focus, naturally, is that her father not be forgotten.\n\"My father was kidnapped from his own home,\" she said.\n\"He's an 80-year-old person that was sitting in his home with my mother, and he w",
    "A woman who brought her rapist before a judge said she did it \"for all women\".\nDaniel Hutchinson, 31, of Cheltenham, was found guilty of two counts of rape and two counts of sexual assault against women in 2021.\nHutchinson, who denied the offences and claimed what took place was consensual, was jailed for 12 years.\nSpeaking after his sentencing, one victim said she will have to undergo \"years of emotional work\" to recover from the trauma.\nDuring the week-long trial at Cirencester Courthouse in February, the court heard how Hutchinson had met one of the women after a night out before raping her at his home.\nThe victim had pretended to be asleep, hoping Hutchinson would stop, the court heard.\nHe also raped and sexually assaulted another woman at his home on a separate occasion.\n'Lack of remorse'\nIn a victim impact statement, one of the victims said she came forward to support the \"women who have been silenced\".\n\"I did this for all women and our collective pain body,\" she said.\n\"I did this for everyone, but most importantly, for once, I did it for me.\"\nHer statement continued: \"The lack of remorse, the lack of accountability and the lack of empathy shown by him makes me angry because of the years I have suffered.\"\nThe other victim described how she became depressed after Hutchinson raped her, and had made an attempt to end her life.\n\"What Daniel did to me will never go away and I will never forget what happened, but I am content in the knowledge that he will now have [to] pay for his actions,\" she said.\n\"I hope that he will learn and reflect about his behaviour towards women and learn not to take advantage of a female when she is so drunk that she cannot consent.\"\nHutchinson, of Alma Close, was sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court on 8 March. He was also put on the sex offenders' register for life.\nSuzanna Butler, of the CPS South West rape and serious sexual offences unit, described Hutchinson as \"a predatory and opportunistic sexual offender\".\n\"The patience, courage and tenacity of the victims in supporting this prosecution has been key in the conviction,\" she added.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X .

    "Former President Donald Trump attended the wake of a New York City police officer who was fatally shot during a traffic stop on Monday.\nOfficer Jonathan Diller died after the occupant of an illegally parked car opened fire on him.\n\"We have to stop it. We have to get back to law and order,\" Mr Trump said outside the Long Island funeral home, after meeting the Diller family.\nHe has sought to make crime a key issue in his presidential campaign.\nMr Diller's killing, which occurs as a debate over public safety and crime has developed in some major US cities, is the first of a New York City police officer since 2022.\nAuthorities have charged 34-year-old Guy Rivera with first-degree murder of a police officer.\nMr Rivera is accused of shooting Mr Diller from a car that was illegally stopped at a bus stop. The policeman had tried to order the occupants to get out of the vehicle when he was shot under his bulletproof vest, the New York Police Department said.\nMr Diller later died at hospital, and his death has further ignited the view - particularly among Republican voters - that crime is a growing problem in New York City.\nNew York Police Department data shows crime has decreased by about 1% over the past two years.\nMr Trump and other Republican figures have regularly accused Democrats of being weak on crime. The former president emphasised this view when he exited Mr Diller's wake flanked by about a dozen police officers.\n\"We have to do a lot of things differently because this is not working. This is happening too often,\" Mr Trump told reporters.\nPresident Joe Biden, a Democrat who Mr Trump is challenging for the White House, was in New York at the same time as his predecessor. He is attending a large fundraiser on Thursday evening at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan.

    "The trial of an Arizona rancher accused of murdering a migrant on his property is due to begin as American voters increasingly focus on issues at the US-Mexico border.\nGeorge Alan Kelly, 75, shot and killed the 48-year-old Mexican national on his ranch in January 2023.\nHis lawyers allege he shot into the air and feared for his family's safety.\nArizona lawmakers have introduced a bill that would allow property owners to shoot trespassers.\nCourt documents say that Mr Kelly was having a meal with his wife on 30 January 2023 when he spotted a group of five camouflaged men moving through his cattle ranch near Nogales.\nHis lawyers claim that he was frightened at the time and shot into the air, rather than directly at the migrants.\nBut prosecutors allege that Mr Kelly recklessly fired an AK-47 rifle at the migrants from a distance of about 295 ft (90m), striking and ultimately killing Mexican citizen Gabriel Cuen-Buitimea. The other migrants escaped unharmed and fled back towards Mexico.\nMr Kelly rejected a plea deal in January that would have seen the charge reduced to negligent homicide in exchange for a guilty plea.\nSecond-degree murder carries a maximum penalty of 22 years in Arizona. The trial is expected to last a month.\nThe controversial trial begins just weeks after conservative Arizona lawmakers in the state's House passed legislation that could allow property owners to kill or threaten to kill people using their property to enter the US.\nThe bill does not specifically mention migrants, but Republican Justin Heap - who sponsored the legislation - said in a February hearing that it would create a legal loophole to help ranchers facing \"an increasingly large number of migrants or human traffickers\".\nArizona's Democratic Governor, Katie Hobbs, has vowed to veto the bill if it makes it to her desk.\nPhoenix representative Analise Ortiz, told NBC last month that the legislation would mean it was \"open season on migrants\" in Arizona.\n\"It would give people free rein to execute somebody and it would broaden extrajudicial killings,\" she said.\nArizona's existing \"Castle doctrine\" allows property owners to use deadly force only to defend themselves or another person from harm. The current law requires that the intruder to be in a residence or other structure in which people live, rather than on their wider property.",
    "The families of three people killed in the Nottingham attacks have called for homicide laws to be changed following a review into the case.\nBarnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, and Ian Coates, 65, were stabbed to death on 13 June.\nValdo Calocane was given a hospital order in January for manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility.\nMr Webber's mother Emma said until the law changed, \"murderers will get away with murder\".\nThe HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI) looked into how the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) handled the case following complaints by the victims' families.\nThe complaints included the families saying they were not provided with \"sufficient information at an early enough stage\" regarding the direction of the case.\nAccording to the HMCPSI, the families said police led them to believe the attacks were \"a clear case of murder\".\n\"The decision to accept pleas was, understandably, always going to be unpalatable for grieving families who have suffered the most unbearable loss in such traumatic circumstances, irrespective of the stage of proceedings that decision was made and communicated,\" the report added.\nInspectors concluded prosecutors were right to accept manslaughter pleas, but could have handled the case better.\nThe report also called on the government to consider changing the categorisation of homicide into three tiers - first degree murder, second degree murder and manslaughter - as recommended by the Law Commission nearly 20 years ago.\nIt is currently categorised into two tiers - namely murder and manslaughter.\nThe victims' families said they were \"disappointed but not entirely surprised\" with the report's findings, and agreed the law needed revising.\nMrs Webber said: \"Until the law changes in this country, the diminished responsibility charge and plea means murderers will get away with murder.\"\nShe added: \"We have never disputed Calocane's mental health problem, but what I would say at the moment in this country if you commit murder and you have mental health issues, then it is very unlikely you are going to be tried for murder.\n\"And it is abhorrent it could be downgraded to manslaughter, just because it is how the law is stated.\"\nMr Coates's son James said the families \"can't breathe until everything is done and dusted\".\nAsked about his grievances with the charges, he said there was \"no opportunity to disagree and push back, we felt we were told what was going to happen and we weren't given an option\".\nDr Sanjoy Kumar, father of Ms O'Malley-Kumar, said: \"I think the first question you have to ask is - can a paranoid schizophrenic commit murder in this country?\n\"Because it seems to me that you can't, and that's impossible for us to understand.\"\nThe HMCPSI review was prompted by a meeting between the victims' families and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\nThe report noted the families felt \"unsupported and secondary to the whole process\", with the watchdog suggesting that greater clarity is needed about the role of victims in the criminal justice system.\nIt said two of the families were invited to a meeting with the CPS and prosecution counsel on 24 November, 7 December and 15 January.\nBut the report said there was no record of a \"third family\" - the Coates family - being specifically told about these meetings, which led to a feeling of being \"left out and overlooked\".\nHad the Coates family been told about the meetings, the review said, they could have made a fully informed choice as to whether to attend or not.\nThe report said: \"The CPS must ensure that, in cases where there are multiple victims/bereaved families, the same level of service is provided to all.\"\nIt recommended the CPS undertake a review of all guidance relating to victims' engagement to ensure its use of the terms \"consult\" or \"consultation\" are appropriate.\n\"There is no obligation on the CPS to 'consult' victims when making a decision on the evidential test of the Code for Crown Prosecutors, but rather to 'inform' and 'explain' their decision,\" the report added.\nFollowing the review, the CPS's director of public prosecutions Stephen Parkinson said: \"In tragic and complex circumstances such as these, the CPS has difficult decisions to make, but must always act with independence and professionalism.\n\"I believe that our team did so in this case, and with considerable dedication and commitment.\n\"I am grateful to the Inspectorate for the care and thoroughness with which they have reviewed our actions. We will carefully consider the report's findings.\"\nMr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar were stabbed to death in Ilkeston Road, before Mr Coates was found dead with knife injuries in Magdala Road after his van was stolen.\nThe stolen van was then used by Calocane to drive into pedestrians Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller in the city centre, with all three left with serious injuries.\nCalocane, 32, who a court heard was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the killings, adm",
    "An Edwardian accident book detailing harrowing injuries and deaths at a Leeds textile mill has been discovered.\nThe employee records, found at Armley Mills, were spotted in a box by Leeds Industrial Museum curators.\nThe grim reading includes falls down flights of stairs, severed fingers and a worker killed by a falling two-tonne cloth milling machine.\nJohn McGoldrick, a Leeds Museums and Galleries curator, called the find a \"treasure trove\".\nThe book provides details of the tough working conditions that textile workers went through shortly after the turn of the 20th Century.\nAmong the tragedies is the death of 44-year-old William Bell, who was killed in 1905 when the machine he was moving toppled onto him.\nHe was killed instantly, the book says, leaving behind a wife and three children.\nIn 1909, a 40-year-old engineer called W. Hinchcliffe was killed while removing firebars from a boiler.\nDoris Gatenby, an 18-year-old weaver, received a cut near her temple when a shuttle flew out of a loom and hit her on the head in 1922.\nMr McGoldrick said: \"Finding these documents is a real treasure trove of information from which we can start to build a much more complete picture of life at the mill.\n\"Seeing such stark details of the injuries and deaths suffered by workers here more than a century ago paints a very vivid picture of how difficult and gruelling their working conditions must have been.\"\nArmley Mills was bought in the late 1700s by Colonel Thomas Lloyd, a Leeds cloth merchant, and it soon became one of the largest in the world for making wool and fabric.\nProduction ended in 1969 and the site reopened as Leeds Industrial Museum in 1982.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "There are concerns that plans to build thousands of homes around Oxford will be put on hold until a sewage treatment works is upgraded.\nThe Environment Agency (EA) has objected to an application for 1,400 new homes near Barton, in Oxfordshire.\nThe estate's toilets would feed into Oxford Sewage Treatment Works, which was due to be upgraded by 2025, but has now been delayed until the 2030s.\nThames Water said it was \"finalising plans\" for the \u00c2\u00a3130m upgrade works.\nThe BBC understands the EA's objection came as a shock to planning officers at South Oxfordshire District Council, which is looking to build five thousand homes around the city in total.\nDevelopers Dorchester Residential Management LTD and Christ Church Oxford are keen to start work on the new homes, which would make up the first phase of the Bayswater Brook development to the north of Barton.\nOne significant objection raised by the agency focused on Oxford Sewage Treatment Works, which it said was a site of \"significant concern\".\nIts report found \"some serious and significant permit breaches\" and said: \"While the site is non-compliant with its permit, the risk to the environment remains high.\"\nThe objection added that Thames Water had promised upgrade work to the site would be done by March 2025.\nAn Environment Agency spokesperson said: \"We understand that the improvement scheme for Oxford Sewage Treatment Works will not be delivered on time and are concerned that any new housing developments before this is finished will cause an unacceptable environmental risk.\n\"We remain committed to engaging with Thames Water to agree a suitable plan to improve the works.\"\nLocal environmentalists said the site had been dumping untreated sewage into the River Thames \"at record levels\".\nThe Oxford Rivers Improvement Campaign (ORIC) said \"increasing\" levels of raw sewage were being dumped into the Thames and the city's sewage capacity urgently needed to increase.\nSo far this year, the treatment works has dumped untreated sewage into the Thames for 1,307 hours, compared to 1,875 hours during the whole of 2023, according to ORIC.\nJames Stevens, director for cities at the Home Builders Federation, said the situation was \"extremely concerning\" and \"extremely frustrating\".\nHe said: \"It would be extraordinarily inefficient, economically, if the growth of this country has ground to a halt because the utility sector hasn't been investing money.\"\nThe 1,400 homes at Bayswater Brook are among thousands more South Oxfordshire District Council plans to build around Oxford as part of its local plan.\nMany of these developments would also require access to the Oxford Sewage Treatment Works.\nLocal planners, who now have to decide whether or not they recommend that South Oxfordshire District Council (SODC) approve the application, are believed to be consulting lawyers to help with their decision.\nOne option could allow the properties to be built, but stipulate that they cannot be occupied until the upgrade work has been completed.\nAsh Smith, from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, described it as a \"step towards forcing water companies to act much more quickly\".\nHe added: \"Let's be really clear, this is not just Oxford. This is Fairford, this is Witney. I could give you a huge list of sewage works in Thames Water's region that we know are under capacity.\n\"So this is the start of a very serious fire that might finally force the water companies to do the job that they've been paid to do, not just to take the money.\"\nA spokesperson for Thames Water said: \"We work closely with developers and planning authorities across our region to ensure water and sewerage infrastructure can support growth, and where upgrades are needed to accommodate new developments, they will happen.\n\"We're finalising plans for a major upgrade at Oxford STW, costing more than \u00c2\u00a3130m.\n\"This will provide a significant increase in treatment capacity, larger storm tanks and a higher quality of treated effluent going to the river.\"\nA spokesperson for developer Bayswater said it had been \"engaging with the Environment Agency and Thames Water around sewage capacity\".\n\"After formal engagement with Thames Water no objections were raised on sewer capacity or other matters,\" it added.\nThe BBC reported earlier that sewage spills into England's rivers and seas by water companies more than doubled last year .\nAccording to the Environment Agency there were 3.6 million hours of spills compared to 1.75 million hours in 2022.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook , X , or Instagram .

    "\"Kate cancer bombshell\", declares the Daily Mail - as all of the front pages feature the announcement from the Princess of Wales, and a photograph from her filmed statement.\nIn what's described by the Daily Express as an \"unprecedented video message\", the paper says she showed \"incredible bravery and fortitude\" in delivering the news of her cancer and chemotherapy.\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph , Catherine received her diagnosis in late February and that is why the Prince of Wales missed the memorial for his godfather, King Constantine II of Greece. The paper also says this public announcement was timed to coincide with the couple's three children breaking up from school for the Easter holidays - allowing them to be \"sheltered at home from the public reaction\".\nThe Times reports that the couple will not attend the Easter Sunday service at St George's Chapel in Windsor.\nThe FT weekend has said the princess's announcement puts an end to weeks of \"frenzied speculation\" on social media about her absence from the public eye. \"Now will the trolls stop?\" is the question posed by the Sun .\nWriting in Weekend I, the former BBC royal correspondent, Jennie Bond, says she hopes the conspiracy theorists who have spread \"absurd and hurtful rubbish\" feel ashamed.\nThe Telegraph's Camilla Tominey adds that while the princess was being \"torn to shreds\" for editing a Mother's Day photograph, she was trying to come to terms with devastating news.\nThe Guardian , however, points out that yesterday's statement does address \"legitimate concerns about transparency head on\".\nThe Daily Mirror says telling your children you have cancer is \"every mother's worst nightmare\".\nWriting in the Sun , one cancer patient explains how her children came through a diagnosis \"largely unscathed\" because young people have an ability to \"absorb, adapt and live in the moment\".\nThe Times has advice for families in a similar situation. The cancer charity, Maggies, is quoted as saying parents should not rush into talking to children and may want to practice saying \"I have cancer\" out loud so it does not come across as too emotional.\n\"We're with you, Kate\", is the message from the Mirror , which forms the basis for one of many supportive editorials. The Times says the nation is \"united in sympathy for her and her young family\". The princess has the \"very best wishes\" of the Mail , with the paper also hopeful that her statement will have have an \"unusually powerful impact on public awareness\" of cancer which could save lives. There is also a \"get well soon\" message from the Sun , with the paper saying: \"Britain's rooting for you\".\nThe princess's diagnosis, alongside that of King Charles III, has prompted much speculation about the state of the monarchy.\nThe Guardian suggests \"three decades on\" that the Royal Family is facing a new \"annus horribilis\". The Times notes that with Catherine and the King \"out of action\", the firm is looking \"positively threadbare\".\nAccording to the Mail , nothing illustrated the \"reduced pecking order\" more than the sight of the disgraced Prince Andrew leading the royals into the memorial service for Constantine II. But the Express says the \"hope\" for the monarchy lies with the Catherine, Prince William and their family whose \"presence amongst us offers peace and harmony in a seriously disjointed world\".\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

    "The boom in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing will drive a spike in energy use, the National Grid has predicted.\nBoth rely on data centres - warehouses full of computer systems.\nChief executive John Pettigrew said the power those data centres use would increase six-fold in the next decade.\nHe said the grid was becoming \"constrained\" and \"bold action\" was needed to create a network able to cope with \"dramatically\" growing demand.\n\"Future growth in foundational technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing will mean larger scale, energy-intensive computing infrastructure,\" Mr Pettigrew said.\nThe National Grid boss said in a speech on Tuesday, shared on LinkedIn , that now was \"a pivotal moment\" for grid transformation - with rising demand for energy-hungry technologies and more people opting for heat pumps or electric cars.\n\"Today, just like in the 1950s, we find ourselves with a network that's constrained,\" he said.\n\"Demand on the grid is growing dramatically, and forecast to double by 2050 as heat, transport and industry continue to electrify.\"\nThe high-voltage transmission network of cables and pylons that make up the UK's \"supergrid\" is now more than 70 years old.\nTo achieve net zero emissions by 2050 in line with global targets, grid operators are under pressure to deliver upgrades to current infrastructure that can meet higher consumer demand for electricity in future and do so sustainably by connecting to renewable energy sources.\nWe are at \"a moment in time that requires innovative thinking and bold actions to create a transmission network for tomorrow's future,\" Mr Pettigrew said.\nPower hungry\nMost observers agree that whatever that future looks like, data centres will be a part of it.\nThey have become integral to our modern lives and technologies, operating as a physical home to our digital information stored in the so-called \"cloud\" and other forms of IT equipment that power services and platforms.\nBut all that computing power comes at an environmental cost. Some studies have warned that the AI industry alone could consume as much energy as a country the size of the Netherlands by 2027 .\nThe sector has been enjoying an economic boom after the launch of chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and image-making tools such as Midjourney.\nConcern over their energy use and demands on infrastructure has increased in recent years.\nOfficial data showed that in the Republic of Ireland, which is home to the European headquarters of several big tech firms such as Google and Facebook-parent Meta, data centres accounted for nearly a fifth of all electricity used in 2022 .\nThe amount of electricity being used by data centres in the country has risen by 400% since 2015 and ignited debate about capacity.\nMeanwhile, quantum computers, which process data differently to regular computers and can complete complex calculations very quickly, are still mostly being used experimentally to see what they can do.\nBut it is hoped in future they could secure scientific breakthroughs and advance secure methods of communication.",

    "Domestic energy prices could be capped based on the time of day that households use their appliances, the regulator Ofgem has said.\nThe watchdog said it has launched early discussions about a \"dynamic\" price cap that changes as consumers became more flexible.\nIt said it would become harder to retain a universal price cap that is suitable for everyone.\nSo it is considering a range of options for changing the current system.\nAt present, Ofgem fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit.\nThat affects about 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of energy will fall to \u00c2\u00a31,690 from April to the lowest for two years - and down \u00c2\u00a3238 a year from now.\nNew ideas\nOfgem said the price cap had worked well to protect customers from the \"loyalty penalty\", where customers on default tariffs paid higher prices, and from the worst of the recent volatility seen in the wholesale energy sector.\nBut it said habits and the market were changing as increasing numbers of consumers changed the way they consumed energy and began using electric vehicles, heat pumps and solar panels.\nA new price cap would need to be flexible for tariffs that allowed price differences if appliances switched on when there is lower demand for energy such as in the night, or when there is more supply from renewables such as when the wind blows.\nTim Jarvis, Ofgem's director general of retail and markets, said: \"We recognise the systems we have in place may need to change too.\n\"We're looking in detail at the elements of the price cap that have worked well and the challenges we've identified in recent years, while also considering how a wide range of future consumers will use and pay for energy to make sure we develop the right measures that will protect and benefit consumers across the board.\"\nOther options included:\nMr Jarvis said there would be widespread consultation and the regulator's aim was to ensure the market worked for everyone.\nIt is impossible to say at this stage how prices would change compared with now for different households if any of these ideas were taken on.\nThere has been some experimentation with tariffs that vary according to when energy is used.\nSome households have been offered discounts to use less electricity at peak times in an attempt to ease demand during cold snaps.\nSimon Virley, head of energy and natural resources at global business services firm KPMG UK, said that while the existing price cap had saved money for customers, this had \"come at a price\".\nHe said it meant \"effective competition and innovation in the market suffering and switching levels falling off a cliff\".\n\"As we look to what a future retail energy market looks like - it will be key to balance proportionate consumer protection with incentives for investment and innovation in a smarter energy system that benefits all consumers,\" he added.",

    "A giant gorilla statue which was stolen from a Lanarkshire garden centre a year ago was \"sawn in half\" before being discarded under a hedge, according to its owner.\nThe 8ft (2.4m) fibreglass ornament, named Gary the Gorilla, was reported missing from Reynard Nursery in Carluke last March.\nOn Friday he was discovered in a layby on the A92 near Dundee.\nHowever owner Andrew Scott said he was \"happy in one way\" to have him back.\nBEAR Scotland staff, responsible for maintaining Scotland's trunk roads network, discovered Gary and reunited him with Mr Scott after reading a BBC Scotland News article about the theft.\nThey tracked down the garden centre on social media and arranged for it to be collected by Mr Scott.\nMr Scott said Gary, who was used as a signpost to the centre, was popular among locals and had welcomed visitors for the last 10 years.\nHe told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We've got Gary back, but only Gary's back. He's been sawn in half.\n\"It was a bit of disappointment when we went to pick him up from Dundee of all places.\n\"He's rather bulky and the only way you'll fit him through a normal door is by sawing him in half and that way you can hide him in the house or put him on a wall - but that's the only reason I can think of.\"\nGary the Gorilla was reported stolen on Sunday 19 March last year.\nCCTV showed a car arrived at the nursery around 22:30 before the occupants unbolted the ornament. A van returned nearly two hours later and removed Gary from the premises.\nThe vehicle was last seen leaving the garden centre and heading in the general Glasgow direction.\nMr Scott said: \"It was quite an elaborate theft, there were about five people involved in the theft but we could never get a registration of the vehicle.\"\nIn April last year, Mr Scott had high hopes of a reunion when he was sent photos of a similar-looking primate tied to a trailer on the M25 and on the M40 near Warwick.\nHowever once the police mapped out the movements of the gorilla, it was determined that the statue was one of several versions made by the manufacturer.\nHe said: \"Someone else bought one of Gary's brothers from London and transported him up on the motorway two weeks later and that caused a lot of online commotion.\n\"I have since spoken to the person who bought Gary's brother and he was actually quite scared with the amount of attention his gorilla was getting.\"\n'Shocked to see a gorilla's bum'\nBut almost exactly a year on, the famous gorilla statue was spotted on the side of the A92 between Dundee and Arbroath.\nAndy Moir, a BEAR Scotland superintendent on the A92, said: \"We were out on our usual morning route inspection when we spotted something lurking in the bushes at the back of a layby.\n\"When we pulled in to check it out we were pretty shocked to see a gorilla's bum staring us in the face.\n\"After we composed ourselves we managed to catch the escapee in the van and take it back to the depot where we set about trying to figure out where it came from.\n\"A little digging online found some articles about a gorilla stolen from Carluke garden centre last year ad we were delighted to be able to reintroduce Gary to his troop.\"\nMr Scott says he hopes the other half of Gary will be returned to him one day.\n\"I'm at Tesco just now buying Gorilla glue in case the other half happens to appear,\" he said. \"But for now, we're planning to fix him to the wall in the garden centre and put a sign up above him saying 'Gary's back'.\n\"We would love to have the front of him as well.\"",

    "Russia is observing a day of mourning after at least 137 people were killed in an attack on Friday evening at a packed concert venue in Moscow.\nFlags are flying at half mast, many events have been cancelled and TV channels have updated their schedules.\nMore than 140 people were also injured when gunmen entered the Crocus City Hall, firing indiscriminately before setting it on fire.\nThe Islamic State (IS) group says it was behind the attack.\nOn Saturday Amaq, the IS media outlet, posted an image of the four masked men they claimed were involved in the assault. Russia has not commented on the IS claim.\nThe group later released highly graphic footage from the attack. The video, which has been verified by the BBC as genuine, shows one of the gunmen opening fire on several people. The BBC will not be broadcasting this video.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said all four gunmen who carried out the attack have been arrested.\nOn Sunday, Russia's Investigative Committee showed the detainees being taken from a van into a building, handcuffed and blindfolded.\nIn his televised address on Saturday, Mr Putin condemned the massacre - the deadliest in Russia for nearly 20 years - as a \"barbaric terrorist act\" and repeated earlier suggestions by Russian security services that the attackers had tried to escape to Ukraine.\nKyiv dismissed the claim that it was in some way involved in the attack as \"absurd\".\n\"To suggest the suspects were heading to Ukraine, would suggest they were stupid or suicidal,\" Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military intelligence directorate, told the BBC.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Mr Putin of seeking to \"blame\" Ukraine for the attack. \"This worthless Putin, instead of dealing with his citizens of Russia, addressing them, remained silent for a day - thinking how to bring this to Ukraine,\" he said in his nightly address.\nBBC Verify has been able to match details of two of the alleged attackers who appear in the IS video and an IS-released still image to videos of the arrested suspects posted on pro-Kremlin Telegram channels.\nThe US National Security Council said it warned Russia of a potential IS attack on \"large gatherings\", including concerts, in Moscow earlier this month. The Kremlin at the time dismissed that as \"propaganda\" and an attempt by Washington to meddle in the recent Russian election.\nOn Saturday, the White House said it condemned  the \"heinous\" attack and described IS as \"a common terrorist enemy that must be defeated everywhere\".\nReports of a serious attack inside the Crocus City Hall, in Moscow's Krasnogorsk suburb, began arriving at around 20:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Friday.\nUp to 6,200 people were gathered there for a Friday night rock concert by veteran band Picnic when the shooting started.\nOne video posted online showed several men striding across the concourse, where they opened fire at members of the public, before rearming and entering the hall.\nCrowds of people were filmed screaming and running in panic as the men burst in. Others were seen taking cover behind their seats as the men fired into the auditorium.\nSome of those who tried to escape from the gunmen were thought to have fled to the basement, and others to the roof.\n\"They were just walking and gunning down everyone methodically in silence. Sound was echoing and we could not understand what was where,\" concertgoer Anastasia Rodionova recalled.\nVitaly, another visitor, saw the attack unfolding from a balcony. \"They threw some petrol bombs, everything started burning,\" he said.\nOutside the hall, huge plumes of smoke filled the sky. A fire was later seen engulfing the hall's roof and facade. Tass state news agency reported that around a third of the building had been set alight.\nOther reports spoke of explosions, the force of which shattered the glass on the top two floors of the structure.\nA number of special forces units stormed the venue, while medical personnel, and dozens of ambulances were sent to the scene. Helicopters, circling overhead, tried to douse the fire.\nThe Russian Investigative Committee said that the attackers used flammable liquid to set fire to sections of the concert hall and that the deaths of the victims were caused by gunshot wounds and poisoning by combustion products.\nOn Saturday, a makeshift memorial was set up outside the concert hall where Muscovites lit candles and laid flowers. Others queued to donate blood for the victims of the massacre.\nIn Moscow and other towns and cities, electronic billboards displayed the image of a single burning candle and the word \"Skorbim\" - \"we mourn.\"",
    "Scotland could become the first UK nation to let terminally-ill people end their lives if a bill that has been introduced in the Holyrood Parliament is approved.\nCampaigner Dame Esther Rantzen also wants Westminster MPs to vote on assisted dying, after a report found some evidence that it had led to better end-of-life care in places where it is allowed.\nA number of countries have legalised assisted dying, assisted suicide or euthanasia, which are all different.\nWhat is assisted dying?\nThere is some debate over exactly what the various terms mean .\nBut assisted dying is generally used to describe a situation where someone who is terminally ill seeks medical help to obtain lethal drugs which they administer themselves.\nWhat is assisted suicide?\nAssisted suicide is intentionally helping another person to end their life . It can involve people who are not terminally ill .\nProviding someone with a lethal dose of sedatives, or helping them go to Switzerland (where assisted suicide is legal), could both be considered assisted suicide.\nWhat is euthanasia?\nEuthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering, in which a lethal drug is administered by a physician .\nIt is legal in fewer places than assisted dying or assisted suicide, and patients do not necessarily have to be terminal .\nThere are two types: voluntary euthanasia , where a patient has given consent, and non-voluntary , where they have not been able to, for example if they are in a coma.\nAre euthanasia, assisted dying or assisted suicide legal in the UK?\nThe laws throughout the UK prevent people from asking for medical help to die.\nMore specifically, euthanasia is illegal under English law and is considered manslaughter or murder. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment.\nThe Suicide Act 1961 also makes it illegal to encourage or assist a suicide in England and Wales. Those found guilty could face up to 14 years in prison.\nSimilar laws also exist in Northern Ireland .\nThere is no specific crime of assisting a suicide in Scotland , but it is possible that helping a person to die could lead to prosecution for culpable homicide.\nHowever, a new bill drafted by the Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur, could see Scotland become the first UK nation to allow assisted suicide .\nMr McArthur expects the bill to be debated in the Scottish Parliament in the autumn.\nIn March 2024, a report from the Health and Social Care Committee highlighted confusion over the rules governing UK doctors providing medical evidence for people who wanted to go abroad to die .\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) advises doctors against producing medical reports to facilitate assisted suicide abroad.\nUK membership of Dignitas, the Swiss assisted dying association, jumped to 1,900 people in 2023, according to the organisation. That is a 24% rise on the previous year.\nIt said 40 people from the UK ended their lives at Dignitas in 2023, the highest level since 2019. In total, it has helped 571 Britons die since 1998 .\nWho is calling for a change in the law in the UK?\nCampaigners have made numerous attempts to alter the law over many years.\nBroadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who has stage four lung cancer, launched a petition in support of assisted dying in December 2023. It has passed the 100,000-signature threshold needed to trigger a debate in Parliament.\nDame Esther, who has joined Dignitas, welcomed the Health and Social Care Committee's findings that end-of-life care had improved in some places which had legalised assisted dying.\nHowever she said she was \"disappointed\" that it had not backed her calls for a vote.\nThe Westminster government says any change is a matter for Parliament.\nProposals on assisted dying were last rejected in July 2022, but the government said it would provide time to debate the subject again . It indicated that MPs would be free to vote as they wished.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer says that he is \"personally in favour of changing the law\" on assisted dying , and is \"committed\" to holding a vote on the issue if he were elected prime minister.\nThe current law has also been challenged in the courts, with a number of people with terminal and life-limiting illnesses arguing for their right to die.\nWho opposes euthanasia or assisted dying?\nBoth the BMA and Royal College of Nursing have neutral positions on assisted dying.\nOthers argue the current legal position around all forms of assisted death should remain the same.\nBaroness Grey-Thompson is concerned that vulnerable people could be coerced into pursuing assisted dying, and that it is hard to put adequate safeguards in place.\n\"We need to make sure people are protected,\" she told BBC Breakfast, arguing that medical complications can arise once lethal drugs enter the body.\nDr Gordon Macdonald, of anti-assisted dying campaign group Care Not Killing, said he believed there were \"many problems\" with changing the law.\nHe is worried that criteria for assisted dying could in time be extended beyond term",

    "Sewage spills into England's rivers and seas by water companies more than doubled last year.\nAccording to the Environment Agency there were 3.6 million hours of spills compared to 1.75 million hours in 2022.\nWater UK, the industry body for sewerage companies, said it was 'unacceptable' but the record levels were due to heavy rain.\nSewage spilling can be legal but environmentalists say it should only happen in exceptional weather.\nAnd the Environment Agency said: \"It is important to note that heavy rainfall does not affect water companies' responsibility to manage storm overflows in line with legal requirements.\"\nThe UK has combined sewage systems which mean rain and sewage share the same pipes, so if there is too much rain sewage treatment works can be overwhelmed. Sewage is spilled into waterways to prevent the system backing up.\nIt works out that on average last year there were 1,271 spills a day across England, compared to 825 in 2022.\nContained within the spills is human waste, wet wipes and sanitary products, which can pose a serious risk to the local wildlife, swimmers and others who use UK waterways.\nThe rain can help to dilute the sewage but academics warn there is still a risk to the local environment and anyone swimming in these bodies of water.\n\"Sewage pollution in the UK severely impacts waterways, with not a single river in England rated as healthy according to the latest Rivers Trust Rivers report,\" said Dr Dania Albini, research fellow in biosciences at University of Exeter.\nShe explained that sewage in rivers can reduce oxygen levels in the water which harms aquatic life and \"causes sickness [in humans] due to the presence of harmful microorganisms and parasites.\"\nIn March this year when the River Thames was in flood, testing at Fulham Reach by the charity River Action revealed that there was up to 10 times the amount of E.coli bacteria that is allowed for bathing water status.\nThames Water are nearing the end of a \u00c2\u00a35bn eight-year-long project to build a super sewer to tackle the issue of sewage spills into the River Thames.\nAndy Mitchell, the CEO of Tideway, told BBC News: \"We're going to capture the vast, vast majority of the sewage that comes into the river and it will mean a cleaner river.\"\nLast year, on behalf of all English sewerage companies, Water UK announced they would invest \u00c2\u00a310bn to upgrade sewage infrastructure - but these plans first have to be approved by the regulator Ofwat.\nWater UK called on the government to accelerate this decision and also other plans like banning wet wipes which they said would eliminate thousands of spills which are happening as a result of blocked drains. The government first promised to introduce this ban six years ago.\nWater Minister Robbie Moore said: I have been clear that sewage pollution in our waters is unacceptable. Today's data shows water companies must go further and faster to tackle storm overflows and clean up our precious waterways. We will be ensuring the Environment Agency closely scrutinise these findings and take enforcement action where necessary.\"\nIn response to the data Labour's Shadow Environment Secretary, Steve Reed, called on the government to introduce an immediate ban on bonuses for polluting water bosses. Ofwat is currently undertaking a consultation to consider this measure.\nLiberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said he called on the government to declare a national emergency.  \"That must include convening an urgent SAGE meeting to look into the impact of sewage spills on people's health,\" he said.\nGreen Party co-leader Carla Denyer said: \"The \u00c2\u00a357bn in payouts from the water industry over the last 30 years should have gone towards improving standards.\"\nThe latest data, revealed by the Environment Agency on Wednesday, was taken from monitoring stations installed at combined sewer overflows or CSOs. CSOs were developed as overflow valves to reduce the risk of sewage backing up in people's homes during heavy rainfall when sewer pipes become overloaded.\nThe overall number of spills was expected to be higher because of the high rainfall in 2023 - which was 20% above average - and for the first time all 14,580 CSOs were fitted with monitors. In 2019 only 57% were fitted with monitors, so only half of spills were recorded.\nJames Wallace, CEO of charity River Action, told BBC News he is not surprised by the high number of spills but more because there is a lack of oversight by the regulators.\n\"Water companies are not being made to invest in fixing their leaky pipes - as long as we have an Environment Agency and Ofwat that are incapable of doing their jobs then we are not in a position to expect water companies to behave,\" he said.\nOfwat and the Environment Agency are both conducting separate investigations into England's nine sewerage companies - with the outcome of those expected this year.\nBut these two agencies are themselves under investigation by the independent Office for Environmental Protection who are concerned they have in",

    "A Nazi hunter with ties to Israeli intelligence was given access to some of the IRA's most sensitive secrets just when the group believed it was about to drive Britain out of Northern Ireland.\nAn upcoming BBC documentary follows the story of Zwy Aldouby.\nRight at the bloodiest point of the Northern Ireland Troubles, he filmed bombers unmasked and met most of the IRA's underground leadership.\nThe film disappeared for almost 50 years and former IRA members have now told the BBC it was a huge mistake to allow Aldouby such unprecedented access.\nMaking an IRA documentary\nZwy Aldouby appeared in Ireland in March 1972 as the director of an US crew making a film about the IRA called \"The Secret Army\" - despite having no apparent track record as a filmmaker.\nThe team had access to the IRA at a time when it was carrying out daily attacks and many in the organisation believed Britain could be forced to withdraw.\nThe 1972 film recorded IRA members planning and carrying out attacks while unmasked.\nThe subsequent disappearance of the potentially incriminating footage is the subject of a feature-length BBC documentary, also called \"The Secret Army\", which is appearing on the BBC iPlayer on 27 March.\nWhile filming between March and June 1972, Aldouby met and filmed the majority of the IRA's secret leadership, known as the Army Council.\nAlso among those filmed handling guns and bombs was Martin McGuinness, then a rising young IRA leader.\nDecades later, as a Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in politician he became the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland and, in that capacity, met Queen Elizabeth on several occasions. He died in 2017.\nFormer IRA members who took part in the film and spoke to the BBC said they were unaware of Aldouby's intelligence connections.\nSome now suspect that Aldouby was a spy, but none of the British, American and Israeli intelligence agencies contacted by the BBC admitted involvement in the IRA documentary.\n\"I find myself wishing that I really knew more about my own father,\" his son, Ilan Aldouby told the BBC.\n\"He's really - I'm tempted to say, like Austin Powers, the international man of mystery.\"\nWho was Zwy Aldouby?\nBorn Herbert Dubinsky in Romania in 1931, Aldouby lost family members to the Nazis but escaped to Palestine after the Second World War.\nThere he joined the Haganah, the paramilitary organisation fighting the British to set up the state of Israel.\n\"He was in the Palmach,\" Israeli historian Prof Michael Bar-Zohar told the BBC.\n\"The Palmach were the shock, the elite troops of the Haganah, and he was commander of a small unit, as far as I know.\n\"He was one of these guys who were taken out of high school at the age of 17 and recruited to the army in order to fight in the War of Independence, and he was very proud of that.\"\nAccording to declassified American files, after Israel gained independence, Aldouby joined Shin Bet, the country's internal intelligence agency.\nA source later told the CIA that Aldouby was hunting former Nazis as part of a Jewish group based in Vienna \"under the guidance of Israeli intelligence\".\nNazi war criminals were tried in Germany and Israel after the war.\nAldouby later became a journalist and moved to the US in the 1950s.\nIn 1961, he came up with an audacious plan - to kidnap a Belgian Nazi Leon Degrelle.\nDegrelle had been sentenced to death in his own country but was living openly in Spain, under the protection of the dictatorship there.\n\"Degrelle was called the Quisling of Belgium,\" said Prof Bar-Zohar.\n\"He was the top Nazi official in Belgium.\n\"And according to the information which was published, Hitler said that `if I had a son I would have loved him to be like you'.\"\nThe plot failed when Aldouby and an accomplice were captured with guns by Spanish police.\nAldouby spent the next three years in jail, with Israel denying being behind the plot.\nThe whole affair was monitored by US intelligence.\nLong-time Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J Edgar Hoover even sent a memo about Aldouby to his counterpart in the CIA, famed spy James Jesus Angleton.\nIreland and the IRA\nAldouby surfaced in Ireland at a key moment - just as Israel's enemy in Libya, Colonel Muammar Gadaffi announced his support for the IRA.\nWithin a short time Libya was supplying weapons to men filmed by Aldouby.\n\"At that point Gaddafi was selling or giving arms to terrorists that were attacking Israel and Gaddafi was also giving arms to the IRA, and Israel at this point was in a very precarious state,\" Ilan Aldouby said.\n\"So my father, if he worked with or collaborated with the Mossad, or Israeli intelligence, it would be a clear fit.\"\nProf Bar-Zorhar said that, from what he knew of Aldouby, Mossad wouldn't have relied on him.\nFor their part, Mossad denied that he was a member of their organisation.\nBut Richard Kerr, a retired deputy director of the CIA, told the BBC team that Aldouby was \"almost certainly\" feeding intelligence to his former comrades.\n\"Mossad, they have long ties and connections,\" Mr Kerr sai",

    "The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has rejected a pay offer for its members in Northern Ireland.\nUnite, Unison and a number of other trade unions representing midwives, radiographers and physiotherapists, voted to accept.\nIt comes after industrial action over pay levels falling behind colleagues across the rest of the UK.\nFollowing the restoration of Stormont, health workers in NI were offered a 5% pay increase and lump sum of \u00c2\u00a31,505 .\nThe pay settlement is for the financial year 2023/24 and is to be backdated to April 2023.\nIn a statement, Health Minister Robin Swann and the Department of Health (DoH) welcomed the \"decisive outcome\" of trade union ballots on the pay offer tabled in February.The DoH said that they will now move to implement the offer.\nRCN says pay offer 'fell short'\nThe director of RCN in Northern Ireland, Rita Devlin, said the union's members voted by 55.85% to 44.15% to reject the offer.\nMs Devlin said the offer \"fell short of pay parity with colleagues in England\", adding \"our members in Northern Ireland will not tolerate being treated unequally and unfairly\".\nThe RCN said it was \"disappointing\" that they could not reach an offer that is equal to others.\nThe union said that it has advised Mr Swann of the result of its ballot and the RCN remains in dispute about the pay offer.\nThis result is hardly surprising - the RCN in Northern Ireland was the first to strike over pay in the UK in 2019.\nIts stance then was defiant and has remained the same since.\nIt argued that throughout the political turmoil in Northern Ireland RCN members have kept hospitals afloat - like they did during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe RCN has said that it has been disappointing that the union couldn't reach a pay offer that's equal to others in the UK.\nThe problem is that, compared to 2020, this time the union is vying for an uplift alongside so many other public-sector workers.\nMeanwhile, a number of other health worker unions voted to accept the pay offer.\n'Historic win for workers'\nUnite the union said this was a \"historic win for workers\" with 81% of its members voting to accept the offer.\nThe union pledged \"to continue efforts to secure legal protections for safe staffing\".\nGeneral secretary Sharon Graham welcomed the outcome, saying she was \"very proud\" of the role Unite members had played.\nUnison, which represents thousands of health workers, said 29,000 of its members voted 77.2% to 22.8% in favour of the offer.\nThe union said they will now move to get this pay uplift with retrospection and the non-consolidated lump sum \"into their members pockets as quickly as possible\".\nMembers of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) also voted to accept the offer made by the DoH, with 86.3% voting in favour.\nKaren Murray, director of RCM Northern Ireland, paid tribute to members, saying their \"resilience over the past few years has been stretched to the limit\".\"We all want to move forward and work together to bring about the improvements to maternity services that women and families and the staff who care for them deserve,\" she said.\nMs Murray said \"rebuilding trust\" will now be vital and she looks forward to working with the minister to make that happen.\nMembers of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists (CSP) working for Health and Social Care Northern Ireland voted 84% in favour of the pay offer.\nSenior negotiating officer Claire Ronald said the CSP \"will continue to make the case for the government to tackle the workforce crisis by paying members a fair and decent wage\".\nShe added they will \"wait to see what the offer is for 2024/25\".\nThe Society of Radiographers returned a 73% vote from their members in favour of the offer.\nCora Regan, the national officer for the Northern Ireland branch of the union, said the response \"does not reflect genuine enthusiasm for the offer, nor does it suggest that it meets the needs of our members in Northern Ireland\".\nMs Regan said \"long-term budget planning for health\" was required, adding that there should be a \"priority on investing in workforce recruitment and retention\".",
    "Some physicists have long suspected that mysterious 'ghost' particles in the world around us could greatly advance our understanding of the true nature of the Universe.\nNow scientists think they've found a way to prove whether or not they exist.\nEurope's centre for particle research, Cern, has approved an experiment designed to find evidence for them.\nThe new instrument will be a thousand times more sensitive to such particles than previous devices.\nIt will smash particles into a hard surface to detect them instead of against each other like Cern's main device the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\nWhat are ghost particles?\nSo what are these ghostly particles and why was a new approach needed to detect them?\nThe current theory of particle physics is called the Standard Model.\nIt says that everything in the Universe is made up of a family of 17 particles - well known ones such as the electron and the Higgs boson - as well as the lesser known but wonderfully named charm quark, tau neutrino and gluon.\nSome are mixed up in different combinations to make up the larger, but still incredibly small, particles that make up the world around us, as well as the stars and galaxies we see in space, while others are involved in the forces of nature.\nBut there's a problem: astronomers have noticed things in the heavens - the way galaxies move, for example - that strongly suggest that all that we can observe makes up just five per cent of the Universe.\nSome, or even all the rest of the Universe, could be made up of the 'ghost' or 'hidden' particles. They are thought to be phantom doppelgangers of the 17 particles of the Standard Model.\nIf they exist, they are really hard to detect because they very rarely interact with the world we know. Like ghosts, they pass straight through everything, and can't be detected by any earthly device.\nBut the theory is that the ghost particles can, very rarely, disintegrate into Standard Model particles, and these can be picked up by detectors. The new instrument increases the chances of detecting these disintegrations by greatly increasing the number of collisions.\nInstead of colliding particles together, which most current experiments do, the Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) will crash them into a big block of material. This means that all the particles are smashed into smaller bits - rather than some of them. The diagram below shows why this 'fixed target' approach is so much more effective.\nThe project's ghostbuster-in-chief, Prof Andrey Golutvin of Imperial College London said that the experiment \"marks a new era in the search for hidden particles\".\n\"SHiP has the unique possibility to solve several of the major problems of particle physics, and we have the prospect of discovering particles that have never been seen before,\" he said.\nThe hunt for ghost particles requires specially adapted equipment.\nWith normal experiments, using the Large Hadron Collider, for example, new particles can be detected up to a metre from the collision. But the ghost particles can remain invisible and travel several tens or even hundreds of meters before they disintegrate and reveal themselves. So SHiP's detectors are placed much further away.\n'We are explorers'\nProf Mitesh Patel of Imperial College described the new approach as \"ingenious\".\n\"What really appeals to me about the experiment is that these particles are right under our noses, but we have never been able to see them because of the way they interact, or rather the way they don't interact.\n\"We are explorers, and we believe that we can see something interesting in this new terrain. So, we have to take a look.\"\nSHiP will be built within existing facilities at Cern, according to Dr Claudia Ahdida, a physicist at Cern.\n\"We will be making use of an existing cavern and infrastructure and parts that we will try and re-use as much as possible and what we will have is a facility that will help us search for this hidden sector, which has not been seen before,\" she said.\nSHiP will run alongside all of Cern's other experiments, the largest of which is the Large Hadron Collider, which has been searching for the missing 95% of the Universe since it was completed in 2008 at a cost of \u00c2\u00a33.75bn. So far it hasn't found any non-Standard Model particles, and so the plan is to build a machine that is three times larger and much more powerful.\nThe Future Circular Collider has an estimated initial cost of \u00c2\u00a312bn. Its planned start date is sometime in the mid-2040s, though it won't be at its full new particle-hunting potential until 2070.\nBy contrast, the SHiP experiment is scheduled to start looking for new particles in 2030 and will be around a hundred times cheaper at around \u00c2\u00a3100m. But researchers say that all approaches are needed to explore all the possible options in order to find the particles that they say would lead to one of the biggest breakthroughs in physics of all time.\nFollow Pallab on X , formerly known as Twitter.\nInside the atom-smasher\nPallab Ghosh and Kate ",
    "A Belfast table tennis club is hoping its secured a Guinness World Record title.\nOrmeau table tennis club originally set the record in 2017 for the highest number of consecutive shots in one continuous rally involving 113 different people.\nIn 2020, a club in Brighton pinched the record title, with a rally of 118.\nAt an event to reclaim the title on Thursday more than 130 participants lined up to take their swipe.\nTo make the record, each participant had to take one shot and move aside as the next person filled in behind and so fourth, forming a continuous rally against one person.\nIf the ball was missed, or bounced twice, then it went back to the beginning of the queue.\nThe event was organised by Ormeau table tennis club with the help of the Mary Peters Trust.\nAt the event, Lady Mary said: \"We support those young table tennis players who have exceptional talent. This is a way of raising the opportunities for young people to learn to play table tennis.\n\"We are here to break the world record. To reclaim it and bring it home. But it is also a fun community event.\"\nFour time Irish champion Paul McCreery is used to the pressure but he said: \"It feels like having 120 different people playing against you, it's exhausting.\"\n\"I think we had around 15 attempts, and by the end I was just so tired mentally, keeping the focus for 120 shots in a row trying not to make a mistake really took it out of me.\"\nAt the event were officials from the Guinness World Records and rally counters to ensure everything was in check.\nDuring the best attempt, the participants began cheering and celebrating as they believed they had broken the record of 118.\nBut the rally counters had only clicked only 116 times - just two shots shy of the record.\nSo it was back to the beginning, with Lady Mary to make the opening serve.\nHowever, after a review by video invigilators it was revealed there were in fact 120 shots made during that best attempt, meaning the record had been broken.\nOrmeau table tennis club is Ireland's first full-time club, and was set up in 2013 by county Tyrone brothers Keith and Gervis Knox.\nThey were presented with the BBC Unsung Hero award in 2017 for their voluntary work and contribution to the sport.\nSince then, the club has grown both in size and in international notoriety after being crowned British premier league champions last year.\nSome of their players, including 13-year-old Peadar Sheridan, have even competed on the world stage.\n'A monumental day'\nKeith Knox said: \"It was a monumental day for the club, I'm so delighted we got there in the end.\n\"There were people who had never hit a table tennis ball in their life at the start of the queue tonight.\n\"There were a lot of the parents, friends and relatives of members at the tennis table club who chipped in to get us this record.\"\nHe admitted that the achievement was far from easy with even of the experienced players missing some returns.\n\"That just shows the pressure that really begins to build once you get to around that seventy or eighty mark. The nerves completely take over.\"\nSpeaking after the event, Gokul Nath said: \"I can't believe that I am part of a world record - it's something I didn't think could happen.\"\nGokul moved to Northern Ireland from India around two years ago and has been playing table tennis for about a decade.\nHe said: \"I have been to different table tennis clubs around Northern Ireland but this is really something quite special.\n\"I am so proud to be part of this moment.\"\nIt could take several weeks for official verification of the record being broken.",
    "A major Japanese drugmaker has said it is investigating a death and dozens of hospitalisations that could be linked to its red yeast rice pills.\nAt least 76 people were admitted to hospital after taking the beni k\u00c5\u008dji fermented rice products, the firm says.\nKobayashi Pharmaceutical reported the illnesses after issuing a voluntary recall of five products last week.\nThe firm urged customers to stop using the pills, which were advertised as cholesterol-lowering supplements.\nKobayashi said it suspected that the problem may have come from previously undetected toxic substances in moulds used in production.\nBeni k\u00c5\u008dji is rice fermented with monascus purpureus, a species of reddish-purple mould. While advertised as a health supplement for high cholesterol and blood pressure, it's also widely used as a traditional colour dye for food products.\nOn Tuesday, the company issued a statement announcing the \"causal relationship\" of its Red Yeast Cholesterol Help product and the customer's death.\nIt said it had received a message from the bereaved family saying the person had died from kidney disease and had been using the Red Yeast Cholesterol Help product the past three years. The firm said there had been a regular mail order.\n\"Although we are diligently confirming the facts and causal relationships, we would like to report this from the perspective of prompt information disclosure,\" Kobayashi said. \"Our company has always prioritised the health of our customers above all else and we sincerely apologise for this situation.\"\nAffected customers had reported symptoms such as changes in the colour of urine, swelling in their limbs and fatigue.\nThe company began an investigation after a doctor alerted them to reported health problems in January. It has since established a hotline for customers.\nIts Red Yeast Cholesterol Help product debuted on shelves in February 2021. The company has so far sold more than a million packets, Japanese media reported.\nThe firm has also supplied beni k\u00c5\u008dji as a food ingredient to food and beverage makers around the world. It warned companies of the risk last week.\nNone have reported any illnesses among customer so far.

    "People should give the Prince and Princess of Wales \"time to heal\" after Catherine's cancer diagnosis, a former royal spokesman has said.\nPaddy Harverson, who previously worked for the couple, defended Kensington Palace's handling of the announcement.\n\"This is not just an institution, it's a family... you also have to remember they're human beings,\" he told the BBC.\nCatherine revealed on Friday that she had begun treatment, after weeks of speculation about her condition.\nShe said cancer was discovered after she underwent abdominal surgery.\nDetails of the cancer have not been disclosed, but Kensington Palace says it is confident the princess will make a full recovery .\nMeanwhile, the King's nephew, Peter Philips, has told Sky News Australia that Charles is in \"good spirits\" but \"frustrated\" that medical treatment was preventing him from returning to royal duties.\nIt comes six weeks after King Charles paused his public appearances following a cancer diagnosis himself .\nThe two were briefly treated at the London Clinic private hospital at the same time.\n\"I suppose I'm biased, some of them are friends of mine, but I think it's very difficult when you're in that situation,\" Mr Harverson told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.\n\"You have to give them the space so while there might be communications... you also have to remember they are human beings and you have to follow their lead to a certain degree,\" he added.\nThe couple have faced intense public speculation about Catherine's health, since her operation in January for a condition that had not been revealed.\nCatherine, 42, has not attended any official events since Christmas.\nA photograph of her and her children, released on Mothers' Day, was met with a frenzy on social media due to inconsistencies in the picture.\nIn a statement, Catherine later apologised for \"any confusion\" caused by the photo, and said that \"like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing\".\nThe Sun's editor Victoria Newton told the BBC that Catherine decided two weeks ago to time her announcement about cancer for the last day of her children's school term.\n\"Her priority was protecting her three children. She didn't want them going to school being asked even more than they already were,\" Ms Newton explained to Laura Kuenssberg.\nThe Times, citing a \"close friend\" of Catherine, reports that the princess decided to record a video message instead of publishing a statement, and that she wrote \"every word of it\" without input from advisors.\nMr Harverson said he had \"no issue\" with how the Royal Family had dealt with the announcement of Catherine's diagnosis, and criticised the \"permanent death loop\" of speculation on social media.\n\"I am sure she wanted the picture to be as best as possible and she apologised for it so everyone should have moved on,\" he said. \"I really do think we should give them time and space\".\nMr Harverson challenged the suggestion that the Royal Family was more fragile because of recent illnesses.\n\"We just have to come to terms with the new reality, there's fewer of them,\" he said.\n\"They will get over this,\" he added. \"I am highly confident that the King, who I know well, is incredibly strong, very resilient, a great spiritual person.\"\nThe Sun has called for \"social media trolls, idiotic conspiracy theorists and sniping media critics\" to \"lay off Kate\" - days after it published a video of Kate and William at a farm shop in Windsor.\nMs Newton defended her decision to publish that video.\n\"It was very important to change the narrative,\" Ms Newton told the BBC. \"A lot of the rest of the media then started saying 'Back off Kate'\".\nShe said that before publication she had been in touch with Kensington Palace and was assured \"there was no problem with us running those images\".\nMeanwhile, also appearing on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Imran Ahmed discussed the viral claims made on social media about Catherine in recent weeks, and warned of the dangers of the platforms.\nMr Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, stressed that social media is \"designed to take the most controversial information and... push it to the front\", making certain topics and viewpoints appear more popular than they really are.\n\"Social media is not the vox populi, nor is it a safe and clever place to get information from. It can be deeply distortive as a lens on the world,\" said Mr Ahmed.\nHe claimed that social media firms have the means to tackle the spread of harmful conspiracy theories on their platform, \"but they choose not to\".\nSeparately, a Kensington Palace spokesman has said the Prince and Princess of Wales were \"enormously touched by the kind messages\" they have received, and that they were \"grateful for the understanding of their request for privacy at this time.\"\nThe couple have already said they will not attend this year's Easter Sunday service.

    "Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has launched a bid to oust Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, the latest move in a long-running internal party battle.\nAs the House of Representatives was voting to approve a $1.2tn (\u00c2\u00a3950bn) spending package that would avert a partial government shutdown at midnight, the Georgia Republican filed a \"motion to vacate\".\nIf she takes the next step and formally introduces the measure, the House could vote on Mr Johnson's fate within days.\nMs Greene, a strong supporter of Donald Trump, said she was starting the removal process as \"more of a warning\".\nThe Louisiana congressman won the speaker's job last October after the previous Speaker, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy, was ousted through a similar tactic.\nThere were weeks of acrimony before he took up the gavel, as several more prominent Republicans tried and failed to secure enough support to win a majority in the chamber.\nOn Friday, more than 100 Republicans voted against the spending bill backed by Mr Johnson and other Republican leaders.\nA group of hard-line conservatives, including Ms Greene, objected to the amount of funding authorised, a lack of sweeping changes to US immigration policy and several provisions supporting healthcare clinics that perform abortions.\nMs Greene, speaking on the steps of the US Capitol after the spending vote, said that Mr Johnson had \"betrayed\" Republicans.\nShe said she did not want to throw the House into chaos, but that she would move forward with her motion to vacate if House Republicans did not find a new leader.\n\"I have respect for him as a person, but he is not doing the job,\" Ms Greene said.\nAt the moment, however, the Georgia Republican appears to have little support within her own party for the move.\nFlorida Republican Matt Gaetz, who led the push to oust Mr McCarthy, said that this latest effort could ultimately lead to a Democratic speaker, perhaps with the backing of centrist Republicans.\nSpeaking to reporters at the Capitol, Republican Congressman Mike Lawler called the move \"idiotic\" and said it harmed conservative priorities and the nation as a whole.\nOn Friday afternoon, the narrow Republican majority in Congress dwindled even further, as Wisconsin Congressman Mike Gallagher - who had already announced he was not running for re-election - said he would formally resign from his seat on 19 April.\nAt that point, Ms Greene would only need one Republican to join her in voting Mr Johnson out, assuming no absences and all the Democrats agree to cooperate.\nThat last bit may not be guaranteed, however.\nSome Democrats have expressed reluctance to help trigger another House power struggle. If Ms Greene is only able to convince a handful of Republicans to go along with ousting Mr Johnson, it would require near unanimous Democratic approval for that vote to pass.\nDemocrats provided that support last year to oust Mr McCarthy, who many had viewed as operating in bad faith. Mr Johnson, who negotiated with Democrats to craft Friday's government spending package, has not engendered such ill will.",

We had checked in online and thought it was fine,\" he added.\nSince the UK left the EU, travellers heading to all countries within the bloc - and including Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland, but not Ireland - must have a passport which was issued less than 10 years before their departure date.\nIt must also be valid for three months after their planned return date.\nPassports issued after 2018 are valid for exactly 10 years.\nHowever, if a UK passport was issued before September 2018, it could be valid for up to 10 years and nine months.\nThis is because before 2018 the passport office used to add up to nine months from an old passport on to a new one.\nAs a result, some people have passports that have not officially expired, and are valid for travel in the rest of the world, but not in parts of Europe because they were issued more than ten years ago.\nAre you affected by the 10-year rule?\nHow do I renew my UK passport and what is the 10-year rule?\n'Catches people out'\n\"The '10-year-rule' is a problem that continues to catch people out\", said Rory Boland, the Travel Editor at Which?\n\"What's really important is that you check your passport validity and expiry date when booking your holiday.\n\"Not when you go to check-in, and certainly not when you travel to the airport, because that's when people are continually finding that their passport is out of date and it's often then too expensive, and too complicated to save their holiday.\"\nBBC News asked the major airlines and holiday operators for data on the number of passengers who are refused boarding, but those that responded said they did not keep detailed records.\n'Holidays lost'\nJane Opher thinks the airlines could be doing more to warn people about the problem when they first book or when they check in.\nThe 61-year-old architect from London was due fly to Barcelona with her partner at the end of February.\nThey had both checked in online, gone through security and had lunch at the airport only to be refused boarding at the gate because her passport was issued on 10 February 2014, more than ten years ago, even though it does not officially expire until 10 August 2024.\n\"It was very stressful - I was traumatised - being told I couldn't board,\" she told the BBC.\n\"It was also humiliating to have to be escorted back through the airport like a criminal.\"\nShe was left hundreds of pounds out-of-pocket.\nSimon Calder, travel correspondent at the Independent, says based on his own research \"easily a couple of hundred people a day\" are being turned away from their flights.\n\"Across the year you could easily find that there's over 100,000 people who lose their holidays as a result of these rules,\" he said.\nHe has written to the airlines, urging them to do more to make people aware, particularly if someone is checking in and inputting their advanced passenger information, often weeks before their travel date.\nAirlines UK told us there was no guarantee that potentially invalid passport details would be picked up in advance, and said airlines do provide reminders and links.\nIt said it was the responsibility of the person travelling to ensure they have a valid travel document.\nFor those people who are due to travel this weekend and spot a problem with their passport Mr Calder told BBC Breakfast: \"I'm afraid all you can do at this stage is try and get an emergency appointment and see if you can get a passport turned around.\n\"But if you're travelling later, maybe in the May bank holidays or the summer holidays then you've got time on your side and just to stress... it's only the EU that cares about the issue date, if you're going to America, Australia, Tunisia they say your passport's valid up to and including the expiry date.\"\nIf someone is turned back at the airport Mr Calder said they were \"absolutely not\" covered and would not get their money back. \"It's always the passengers' responsibility to make sure they are compliant.\"\nThe Home Office also said it provided up-to-date information on passport requirements on its website, which it keeps under constant review.\nFee",

    "Japan's cabinet has approved the export of new fighter jets it is developing with the UK and Italy, in the latest move away from its pacifist policies.\nIt eased arms export rules to allow the jets to be sold to countries that Japan has signed defence pacts with, and where there is no ongoing conflict.\nJapan has pledged to double military spending by 2027, citing threats posed by China and North Korea.\nEach fighter jet sale will require cabinet approval, authorities said.\nIn December 2022, Japan joined a UK-Italy collaboration, dubbed the Tempest, to develop this new fighter jet that will use artificial intelligence and advanced sensors to assist pilots.\nThe jets are expected to be deployed by 2035 -  in what is Tokyo's first defence equipment development partnership with a country other than the US.\nThe latest move comes ahead of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's official visit to the US in April, where he is expected to stress Tokyo's alliance with Washington and his country's readiness to be more involved in defence partnerships.\nMr Kishida had also said that allowing the export of warplanes to third countries is \"necessary\" to maintain Tokyo's credibility as a partner in other future international defence projects.\n\"The plan to make fighter jets with capabilities essential for the security of our nation must be realised to ensure that our nation's defences won't be compromised,\" government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Tuesday.\nBut Japan's Defence Minister Minoru Kihara clarified that Japan would still remain committed to the \"basic philosophy of a pacifist nation\" by going through \"strict decision processes\" for exports.\nAfter World War Two, the US-occupied Japan adopted a constitution which says the country renounces war and the use of force to settle international disputes. The constitution does not officially recognise the military and limits it to self-defence capabilities.\nIt also imposed an arms export ban, which was eased for the first time in 2014 under then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\nIn December 2023, Japan eased the rules further to allow the sale of lethal weapons it makes under foreign licenses to be exported to the country where the licenser is based.\nThis paved the way for Tokyo to send Patriot air defence missiles to the US. Patriot missiles are among the most advanced weapons supplied by the US to Ukraine.",

But it seemed so unlikely that it would ever actually happen.\"\nNolan had previously been nominated for six Academy Awards, but had never won an Oscar for directing until this year's ceremony.\nAside from Oppenheimer, Thomas has also worked on a string of other Nolan films including Tenet, Dunkirk, Interstellar, The Dark Knight, The Prestige, Batman Begins, Insomnia and Memento.\nThe pair met while they were students at University College London and they married in 1997.\nThey have four children together and live in Los Angeles.",
    "An NHS watchdog has apologised to 29 doctors at Scotland's biggest hospital for not fully investigating their concerns about patient safety.\nA&E consultants at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital wrote to Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) to warn patient safety was being \"seriously compromised\".\nThey offered 18 months' worth of evidence of overcrowding and staff shortages to back their claims.\nBut HIS did not ask for this evidence.\nThe watchdog also did not meet any of the 29 doctors - which is almost every consultant in the hospital's emergency department - to discuss the concerns after it received the letter last year.\nInstead, it carried out an investigation where it only spoke to senior executives at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde before then closing down the probe.\nHIS has now issued a \"sincere and unreserved apology\" to the consultants and upheld two complaints about the way it handled their whistleblowing letter about patient safety.\nOne consultant who signed the letter told BBC Scotland: \"We'd exhausted all our options and thought HIS was a credible organisation.\n\"We offered to share evidence of patient harm. We were shocked that they ignored this and didn't engage with us as the consultant group raising concerns.\"\nAnother consultant added they were \"shocked at their negligence\".\nA Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) source told BBC Scotland: \"The inquiry seems to have started and ended with HIS asking hospital managers if everything was okay and being assured it was.\n\"If almost 30 named consultants raising very serious fears for patient safety does not prompt a rigorous independent investigation, what will?\".\nHIS said it had apologised for the shortcomings in its response and is committed to learn lessons.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said improving overall patient safety at QEUH is its top priority.\nThe consultants' plea\nThere have been longstanding concerns about patient safety standards in the emergency department at the QEUH.\nIt is one of the country's busiest A&Es and has regularly failed to meet Scottish government targets on treating patients within four hours.\nIn 2022, BBC Scotland revealed how A&E doctors had urged NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to declare a major incident at the hospital amidst fears the department would be overwhelmed.\nIn May last year, 29 consultants in emergency medicine at QEUH wrote to HIS to warn that patient safety was being \"seriously compromised\" by issues in the A&E such as treatment delays, \"inadequate\" staffing levels and patients being left unassessed in unsuitable waiting areas.\nThey claimed this has resulted in \"preventable patient harm and sub-standard levels of basic patient care\".\nThe doctors also said this meant \"a number of critical events have occurred including potentially avoidable deaths\".\nThe medics' signed off the letter by saying they were getting in touch with HIS as they said repeated efforts to raise the issues with health board bosses \"failed to elicit any significant response\".\nComplaint closed\nIn August last year, HIS wrote to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde chief executive Jane Grant to tell the board it was closing its investigation into the consultants' complaint as it was satisfied there was \"awareness and oversight of the issues and of the performance of the emergency department\".\nThe letter lists what the board told HIS it was doing to address the problems but also points out a \"great deal remains to be done in order to improve communication and relationships\" with staff.\nIt also reveals some of the internal reviews required to be carried out after significant adverse events in the hospital were \"significantly overdue\".\nThe letter referenced a meeting between HIS officials and Morag Gardner, the board's deputy nurse director, and Scott Davidson, deputy medical director.\nAfter getting hold of this HIS letter to the health board, the consultants complained to watchdog for failing to meet them or reviewing any of the \"extensive documentary evidence\" they offered to provide.\nIn January this year, HIS upheld a complaint that it did not provide any of the 29 doctors with the opportunity to discuss their concerns directly with its officials.\nA second complaint, that there was no opportunity to provide evidence to substantiate the consultants' claims, was also upheld.\nIn a letter from Robbie Pearson, HIS chief executive, to the consultants, he said: \"I would like to offer my sincere, unreserved apology for our shortcomings in this matter and the clear distress they caused you all.\n\"May I also offer an assurance that HIS will learn lessons and implement changes to published process and their application as a direct result of your complaint\".\nEvidence of patient safety concerns offered by the consultants has now been shared with HIS and it is being reviewed with the potential of leading to a new review of the concerns about QEUH's emergency department being launched.\nDr Lailah Peel, a member of the BMA Scottish Council and an",
    "Hong Kong has introduced a new security law that the government says is necessary for stability, but has raised fears that civil liberties will be further eroded.\nThe law, called Article 23, covers treason, sedition and state secrets, and allows for trials to be held behind closed doors.\nWhat is Article 23 and how does it change Hong Kong security laws?\nHong Kong's leader, John Lee, signed the law into force on 23 March.\nHe has said it is necessary to guard against \"potential sabotage and undercurrents that try to create troubles\".\nChina's Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has said it would protect \"core national interests\" and allow Hong Kong to focus on economic development.\nArticle 23 allows for closed-door trials and gives the police rights to detain suspects for up to 16 days without charge.\nOrganisations and companies can be banned from operating in Hong Kong, should they be found \"working for foreign forces\".\nArticle 23 expands on the Beijing-imposed national security law, which already criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Other offences it covers include:\nThose found guilty of treason, insurrection, inciting a member of the Chinese army to mutiny, or colluding with an external force to damage or weaken public infrastructure could be sentenced to life imprisonment.\nWhat are the criticisms of Article 23?\nHong Kong officials have justified Article 23 by saying that most offences outlined in the legislation are also covered under similar laws in Western nations.\nHowever, critics say the new law gives authorities yet another tool to crack down on dissidents and erode freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997 .\nArticle 23 will \"take repression to the next level\", said Amnesty International's China Director Sarah Brooks.\n\"The rapid progression of legislation under Article 23 shows the government's eagerness to further dismantle human rights protection and turn its back on its international obligations,\" she said.\nThe political motivation behind the new law appears to be \"more important than any practical need\", said Eric Lai, research fellow at the Georgetown Center for Asian Law.\n\"The current Beijing-imposed national security law has already silenced dissent and the voices of civil society. Hong Kong has also not seen any large-scale demonstrations in the past three-and-a-half years,\" he told BBC Chinese.\nThe national security law was imposed by Beijing in 2020 . Authorities credit it with restoring stability in the city after widespread pro-democracy protests in 2019.  At least 260 people have already been arrested under the NSL, which critics say reduced the city's autonomy.\nThere are also fears that Article 23 may reduce Hong Kong's attractiveness as a hub for international business.\nHow long has Hong Kong's Article 23 been planned?\nFor decades.\nAn attempt to pass the bill back in 2003 was shelved after massive protests.\nHalf a million Hongkongers came out onto the streets and more than 90,000 submissions were made during a three-month consultation.\nThen-chief executive Tung Chee-hwa's administration withdraw the legislation and the strong opposition also saw the resignation of security minister Regina Ip.\nThe government claims the decision to introduce Article 23 in 2024 follows a 99% support rate during the latest public consultation.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Chinese\nUPDATE: This article was updated to clarify details about Hong Kong's national security law.",

    "The energy secretary questioned the decision to approve a controversial power plant in the constituency of a cabinet colleague.\nClaire Coutinho's department admitted she had sought \"clarification\" on the process that led to the waste-burning incinerator being signed off.\nBut it denied a claim in leaked legal advice that she had wanted to overturn approval of the scheme.\nThe project is opposed by Environment Secretary Steve Barclay, the local MP.\nMVV Environment, a German energy company, wants to build the plant in Wisbech, in Mr Barclay's North East Cambridgeshire constituency.\nIt would be one of Europe's biggest waste-to-energy incinerators, burning non-recyclable waste in order to generate energy for local industrial use.\nAn internal legal note compiled after consultation with the government's most senior legal adviser, Sir James Eadie KC, stated that Ms Coutinho had \"sought to overturn\" a junior minister's decision to approve the incinerator.\nIt warned that her intervention, among other factors, risked any decision to block the scheme being deemed unlawful by the courts.\nMs Coutinho's department insists that she never sought to overturn the scheme, and that she only wanted to ensure \"the decision-making process had been properly followed\".\nShe then concluded that the process was correct, and upheld the approval decision.\nThe scheme was given the go-ahead last month by Ms Coutinho's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (Desnez), following a recommendation from the Planning Inspectorate.\nSources claim Mr Barclay was livid at this decision, and sufficiently angry that Downing Street was aware of his fury.\nAnnouncement taken down\nThe decision was taken by Lord Callanan, a junior energy minister, while Ms Coutinho was out of the country.\nUpon her return, she is understood to have raised questions about why the matter had been delegated to Lord Callanan and whether that had been appropriate.\nThe day after Lord Callanan's approval of the scheme was confirmed, the announcement was suddenly removed from the internet. It was later reinstated.\nTo move ahead, the scheme also requires a permit from the Environment Agency (EA), a public body sponsored by Mr Barclay's environment department.\nThe BBC revealed last week that concerns about Mr Barclay's relationship to the case had been raised by civil servants.\nThis prompted discussions with Whitehall's propriety and ethics unit, with Mr Barclay agreeing to delegate that decision to a junior minister in his department, Mark Spencer.\n'Perception of bias'\nThe leaked legal advice offers a view on what it calls \"the proposal for an urgent direction to the EA to pause permitting applications for up to a year\".\nBut it concludes that this \"would be unlawful because the consultation undertaken with the EA was plainly inadequate\", describing Mr Barclay's longstanding public opposition to the scheme as a \"powerful exacerbating feature given the perception of bias\".\nAs part of the \"factual background\" to the case, the legal advice states: \"It will not escape the notice of potential challengers or the courts that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there were issues with [the approval] in which [Ms Coutinho] sought to overturn the decision by the minister in Desnez, Lord Callanan.\n\"The strong impression is, and the allegation in litigation will undoubtedly be, of every possible step being taken to overturn the effect of a [decision] on grounds of political advantage, rather than on legitimate policy grounds.\"\nA Desnez spokesperson said: \"Clarification was sought on whether the decision-making process had been properly followed, rather than to overturn any decision.\n\"Ultimately, it was agreed that it had, and the relevant documentation was reinstated on the website.\"",

    "An increase in beatings, vandalism and episodes of racism against Central Asian migrants has been reported in Russia since the deadly attacks at Moscow's Crocus City Hall last Friday.\nFour Tajik nationals have been accused of killing 140 people in the attack, claimed by jihadist group Islamic State. Several other suspects have been arrested, all of Central Asian origin.\nForecasting a rise in tensions in the aftermath of the Moscow murders, the embassy of Tajikistan in Russia warned its citizens at the weekend not to leave their homes unless necessary.\nCentral Asian migrants make up a sizeable proportion of Russia's migrant labour population, particularly in the retail, transportation and construction sectors.\nMany already experience high levels of discrimination. They are \"often confronted with broad social xenophobia that sees them as something of an underclass,\" Prof Edward Lemon of Texas A&M University told the BBC.\nTajik-born singer Manizha Sanghin, who represented Russia at Eurovision in 2021, condemned the \"flagrant atrocity\" of the Moscow attack, but warned of the \"consequences that will descend upon Tajiks and all residents of Central Asia\". She is now a goodwill ambassador for the UN refugee agency.\nThere are about 10.5 million migrants from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia, according to the Russian Interior Ministry. Many more are potentially unregistered.\nThe high numbers are due to a visa-free regime with Russia which makes it one of the only options for Central Asian migrants looking for the economic opportunities they don't have at home, Prof Lemon explained.\nDespite the Tajik embassy's warning, news that the Crocus City Hall attackers were Tajik nationals quickly travelled across Russia.\nOver the weekend, a migrant-owned business was burnt down in the city of Blagoveshchensk in Russia's Far East, while several migrants were beaten up in Kaluga, a city south west of Moscow.\nMigrants from Kyrgyzstan were held at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport for two days and locked in a room without food or water only to be later returned home, while taxi drivers in Moscow reported being asked by clients to confirm that they were not Tajiks.\nWithin hours of the Crocus City Hall attack, messages on Telegram messaging group chats in the early hours of Saturday betrayed a growing nervousness among the migrant community in Russia.\n\"Many people already don't like non-Russians, and now we have this situation,\" one person wrote on a group entitled \"Tajiks in Moscow\".\nWorried about the risk of a backlash on the Tajik community, another said: \"Please, God, let [the attackers] be Ukrainian instead.\"\nValentina Chupik, a lawyer who works with migrants without charge, told Russian media outlet Mediazona she had received 2,500 reports of \"acts of aggression\" against migrants in the two days following the Moscow attack.\nPolice broke into migrants' dormitories and hostels across the country and detained several people. More than 30 cases of torture following the arrests were also reported, Ms Chupik said.\nFour days on, the lawyer told the BBC that numbers were continuing to rise and several Tajiks had told her they were considering leaving Russia.\n\"A group of Tajik citizens asked me to provide them with safe accommodation because they are scared to live in their hostel,\" Ms Chupik said.\nMs Chupik says discrimination in Russia typically affects migrants \"who do not have Slavic facial features\", and \"most of the humiliation and violence comes from Russian law enforcement rather than from ordinary people\".\nWhile Friday's attack in Moscow has exacerbated the situation, migrant communities have long been the targets of police crackdowns.\nEvery year, Russian authorities carry out large anti-migrant campaigns, launching dozens of raids on Central Asian businesses, mosques and places of gathering. Last year's campaign reportedly resulted in more than 15,000 migrants being deported.\nIn January, the Kyrgyz and Uzbek governments demanded that Russia investigate a social media video showing migrant workers being insulted and humiliated during a raid in Yekaterinburg.\nAnd yet many Central Asian migrants often have little choice but to continue working in Russia. Tajikistan is the poorest country in Central Asia and half its gross domestic product (GDP) comes from remittances sent by relatives abroad.\nThat is why they still head for Russia \"in spite of the many problems,\" Prof Lemon said.\nAnd Russia's complex migration laws mean that even labourers who enter legally often end up staying without the required paperwork.\nLife as an undocumented migrant means becoming more susceptible to abuse from employers, substandard living conditions and no access to healthcare.\nIt also means a greater risk of detention, which in turn leads to having to pay hefty bribes to authorities.\nSoon after the Moscow attack, several Russian MPs called for the tightening of migrant laws. One suggested migrants should be expelled from Russia \"fo",

    "Former US Senator and vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman has died at 82.\nThe cause was complications from a fall, according to a family statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\nThe centrist represented the state of Connecticut in the Senate for nearly a quarter of a century.\nMr Lieberman became the first Jewish politician to join a major party US presidential ticket in 2000 when Al Gore selected him as his running mate.\nMr Gore said he was \"profoundly saddened\" to learn of Mr Lieberman's passing.\n\"It was an honour to stand side-by-side with him on the campaign trail,\" Mr Gore said in a statement. \"I'll remain forever grateful for his tireless efforts to build a better future for America.\"\nThe long-time politician served as the US senator from Connecticut between 1989 and 2013. He was a powerful legislator and his support was sought after in Washington.\n\"Senator Lieberman's love of God, his family, and America endured throughout his life of service in the public interest,\" his family said in its statement.\nA Democrat of long standing, he broke from his party ranks on several issues - including its opposition to the Iraq War. He won his final term in office in 2006 as an independent.\nIn recent years, he was known as the founding chairman of No Labels, a centrist political group that aimed to establish a third-party presidential ticket for the general election in 2024.\n\"Senator Lieberman was a singular figure in American political life who always put his country before party,\" No Labels said in a statement on Wednesday.\nMr Lieberman made that clear in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV last week.\n\"Thomas Jefferson once said America will need a little political rebellion every now and then, which should be as important in politics as the storms are in the natural world,\" he said.\n\"And I think he meant to clear away the dead wood, and boy, does our political system need a good storm and a political rebellion right now.\"\nMr Lieberman was born in Stamford, Connecticut in 1942, and worked his way through state politics, serving as both a state senator and the state attorney general before launching himself to the US Senate in 1989.\nMr Lieberman was one of the most prominent Jewish politicians in the US during his career. His White House run with Mr Gore was a milestone for Jewish Americans and the former senator was public in the exercise of his faith.\nAs a moderate Democrat, Mr Lieberman developed a reputation in Washington for crossing party lines - as well as simply crossing members of his own party.\nIn 2000, Mr Gore selected Mr Lieberman as his running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket. They would go on to lose to Republican George W Bush and his vice-presidential pick, Dick Cheney, in one of the most contentious conclusions to a presidential election in American history.\nBut by 2008, Mr Lieberman was endorsing a Republican presidential candidate, the US Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was his close friend.\nMr McCain would ultimately lose to Barack Obama, America's first black president.\nAs a senator, Mr Lieberman also backed several progressive policies. He notably helped end the Pentagon's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which barred LGBTQ people from openly serving in the military.\n\"When I look back at my own career, the legislative achievements I am proudest to have been part of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 all were achieved only because a critical mass of Democrats and Republicans found common ground,\" Mr Lieberman said in his farewell speech from the Senate in December 2012.",
    "A parkland, thought to be the world's first nature reserve, has been added to Historic England's protected register of parks and gardens.\nWaterton Park was created by 19th Century naturalist Charles Waterton, at his family's estate near Wakefield.\nShooting and fishing were banned on site by Waterton and a boundary wall was put up to keep out predators.\nHistoric England described the park as the \"first known example of a landscape designed to protect wildlife\".\nAs well as stopping hunting and fishing, Waterton also barred neighbouring keepers and their dogs from entering during nesting season and worked to create new habitats for native birds.\nThe three-mile-long boundary wall - which has been given Grade II listed status - took five years to complete with Waterton - a teetotaller - claiming \"it was paid for by the wine I do not drink\".\nIn addition to his efforts to prevent disturbance and predators, Waterton planted new trees and undergrowth cover and also allowed part of the lake to become swampy for the benefit of herons and waterfowl.\nAccording to Historic England, as a result of his work, one winter he recorded 5,000 wildfowl sheltering on the lake and over the years he noted 123 bird species in the park.\nRecognising the benefits of wildlife and nature on the public Waterton also actively encouraged people to visit the park to connect with the surroundings.\nSarah Charlesworth, listing team leader for Northern England, said: \"Charles Waterton was a true visionary who recognised both the value of protecting wildlife and the powerful link between nature and our wellbeing.\n\"With Waterton Park, he created a prototype for the modern nature reserve, where wildlife and humans can exist in harmony for their mutual benefit.\"\nJohn Smith, chair of the Friends of Waterton's Wall, said he hoped the new status of the park and wall would help bring Waterton's \"life and works to a wider audience not only locally but nationally\".\nMark Lynam, corporate director for regeneration, environment and economic growth at Wakefield Council, said the new recognition for Waterton Park was \"hugely welcomed\".\n\"It increases the protection that can be given to the landscape and Waterton's wall around it,\" he said.\n\"It safeguards the things that make them special, and this is likely to be of interest not only to people in the district but potentially across the country and world as well.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "On a cloudy Monday afternoon, Bill Nighy is standing in the middle of a football pitch in south London.\n\"Come on you lot, let's go,\" the actor shouts at a couple of dozen men who have turned up hoping to be selected to represent their country.\nNighy is channelling his most recent character - a football coach who takes an England squad to an international tournament.\nThe tournament is the Homeless World Cup, and to promote his new film The Beautiful Game, the Oscar-nominated actor has turned up to the real-life trials for the next event in South Korea.\n\"I didn't know anything about the Homeless World Cup before, but it really is a simple and sensational idea,\" Nighy says.\nFor him, one of the best things about being part of the film was meeting the extras who had participated in real tournaments and are now no longer homeless. \"It's a very sweet bit of symmetry,\" Nighy tells the BBC.\nThe Homeless World Cup involves a four-a-side format, and the film strips football back to its basics - removing the fame, money and power that are sometimes associated with the game.\nAlthough The Beautiful Game shows the potential for sport to create change, the actor - a Crystal Palace fan - confesses he's not sure whether football actually has that power.\n\"I'm not sure really,\" he says. \"But I think it does bring everyone closer and brings people from all of the world together. It's a universal language for about half of the world, and I think to some degree it can alleviate prejudice.\"\nEngland's real coach for the Homeless World Cup is Frankie Juma, who started playing football in the UK when he joined a refugee team.\nHe says he wanted to become a coach in order to give back to the community. \"It's nice to do something that gives back to the country that gave me a safe space, and I like helping people and making those that had similar experiences to me feel comfortable.\"\nAt Juma's training sessions, it's not just about football.\n\"We probably do 30% football and 70% support because the people that come to us often need access to education or services such as housing, which is a huge issue right now,\" he explains.\nJuma is now on the hunt for eight men who will represent England at the forthcoming Homeless World Cup in September.\nOne player that has caught his eye is 35-year-old Courtney, who has had his share of ups and downs.\n\"I'm getting back into football now because it really helps me de-stress and it makes me forget about everything in life, because I just want to have fun and build up my fitness,\" he says.\nFootball has helped him avoid homelessness, he says. \"If I'm out here, I'm not doing things I shouldn't be.\"\nCourtney says it would be a dream to represent England.\n\"Some people would say I'm the black Tony Adams, and if we stay focused there is no reason why we can't go all the way.\"\nOne member of the film's cast who particularly related to Courtney's experience of homelessness is Micheal Ward.\nWard plays Vinny, a star player who is living in his car after his relationship broke down, and the Top Boy actor himself experienced homelessness growing up.\n\"Me and my family have been homeless many times and I hadn't realised it because my mum would try to cover it up, and the times she wasn't able to do that she would make a joke about it. So I never understood the seriousness behind it,\" he tells the BBC.\nWard found a new perspective on homelessness after spending time with the film's extras, who were former participants in the Homeless World Cup.\n\"I want people to take away the idea that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I'm guilty of doing that and seeing people on the street thinking, what the hell? But you realise that a lot of the situations they are in are not their fault, or they are spiralling and we don't know the source of that.\n\"I now try to be more aware and do a little bit more to help.\"\n'I've come full circle'\nRaph Aziz is a former Homeless World Cup player who represented England at the 2018 tournament in Mexico.\nThe 32-year-old came to the UK 12 years ago and experienced homelessness and prison time before finding accommodation at a Salvation Army hostel for four years.\nWhile there, he joined a football project and his passion for the sport continued to grow.\n\"There's a clear before and after for me,\" he says. \"When I came back from the tournament in 2018, I was full of confidence, had the ability to network, made loads of friends, and felt really inspired to give back to the community.\"\nThe Homeless World Cup's founder Mel Young, who also set up the Big Issue Scotland, says the power of sport to create a community should not be underestimated.\n\"The power of sport is actually really understated, and I think we need to use sport more as it is a common language that people can understand.\"\nAfter the competition, Aziz chose to train as a charity worker for the organisation that helped support him when he first arrived.\n\"I've been full circle since my homeless days and it is all thanks to the opportunitie",
    "A three-storey building in Kyiv has been badly damaged, Ukrainian officials say, as the city comes under renewed Russian attack.\nThey said two ballistic missiles were intercepted, but seven people were injured as debris fell.\nExplosions were heard across the Ukrainian capital and a column of smoke was seen rising in the east.\nThe city's mayor urged residents to immediately take cover as the attack came virtually without warning.\nMoments before the explosions the Ukrainian air force warned in a message on Telegram that a missile was flying towards the city.\nIt is unusual to have such attacks without an air raid alert.\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on his Telegram channel:  \"Explosions in the capital. Urgently to the shelter!\"\nUkraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, posted videos online purporting to show school children running to a shelter.\nThe country's air force commander said Russia fired two ballistic missiles from Crimea, which was annexed by Moscow, but both were intercepted by air defences.\nFollowing a string of explosions, missile debris came down in the Pechersky district, not far from the centre of Kyiv, and several other areas.\nThe attack is the third on Kyiv by Russia in five days.\nLatest reports say ten people including a teenage girl were injured. Two people were taken to hospital.\nA Kyiv resident, Oksana, said she was at work when she first heard the air raid sirens followed by the sound of explosions.\nShe told the AFP news agency: \"Before I could do anything, the first explosion hit, There was a cloud of dust, smashed cars, windows, everything.\"\nAnother resident, Roman, told the BBC: \"The blasts - which were very loud, happened right after the capital's air raid sirens had started sounding.\"\nThe US ambassador in Kyiv, Bridget Brink, said on social media that Russia had used hypersonic missiles to attack the Ukrainian capital.\nShe added that there was \"not a moment to lose\" as Ukraine needed American assistance now, alluding to a $60bn military aid package which has been held up in the US Congress.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack showed again that Ukraine needed better air defence systems from its allies.\nIn a social media post, Mr Zelensky said: \"It means safety for our cities and saved human lives. All of us in the world who respect and protect life need to stop this terror.\"\nOvernight there were also drone attacks on Odesa and Mikolayiv in the south of Ukraine, hitting energy infrastructure and leaving some areas without electricity.\nThe latest assault on Kyiv comes after Ukraine said it had hit two landing ships, a communications centre and other infrastructure used by Russia's Black Sea fleet off Crimea on Sunday.\nThe Ukrainian general staff said the Yamal and Azov ships had been destroyed.\nThe BBC, however, has not been able to verify the Ukrainian claim to have damaged the ships, which are designed to land troops and equipment straight to shore without the need for a pier or dock.\nOn the same day, one of Russia's cruise missiles entered the airspace of neighbouring Poland, a Nato member.\nPolish armed forces said in a statement that the object had stayed in Polish air space for 39 seconds. Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said that if the missile had been seen to go in the direction of any targets located in Poland, then \"of course, it would have been shot down and more adequate measures would have been taken\".\nOn Monday, Poland's foreign ministry said that the Russian ambassador in Warsaw failed to show up for a diplomatic summons.\nThe ambassador, Sergey Andreyev, told Russia's Ria Novosti news agency that he felt \"it made no sense to discuss this topic without any provision of proof, and I refused to visit the Polish foreign ministry\".\nThere has been an increase in aerial attacks by both sides in the past few days, while Russia makes slow progress in taking some territory in the east of the country.\nOn Friday, Russia fired dozens of missiles at Ukraine, hitting a dam and leaving a million Ukrainians without power , in the wake of fierce Ukrainian bombardments on Russian border regions. The Russian authorities said a Ukrainian drone attack had caused a fire at a large power plant in Rostov.\nMeanwhile Kharkiv - close to the Russian border - is still in partial blackout after all its power substations were destroyed by Russian attacks on Friday.",

    "Nobel prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman has died, aged 90.\nHe became synonymous with behavioural economics, even though he never took a course of economics.\nKahneman wrote the best-selling book Thinking, Fast and Slow. It debunked the notion that people are rational beings who act out of self-interest - they act based on instinct, he argued.\nHis death was announced by Princeton University where he had been working since 1993.\n\"Danny was a giant in the field, a Princeton star, a brilliant man, and a great colleague and friend,\" said prof Eldar Shafir.\n\"Many areas in the social sciences simply have not been the same since he arrived on the scene. He will be greatly missed.\"\nKahneman was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 1934, and spent much of his early years in Nazi-occupied France, where his father worked as chief of research in a chemicals factory.\nThe family moved to what was then British-ruled Palestine in 1948, just before the creation of the state of Israel.\nKahneman graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1954, and went to the US four years later to begin a doctorate in psychology at the University of California Berkeley.\nKahneman returned to Jerusalem in 1961 to begin his academic career as a psychology lecturer, where he met Amos Tversky - a cognitive psychologist with whom he would go on to win the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences in 2002.\nHis work with Tversky would go on to form the basis of the best-selling book Thinking, Fast and Slow, published in 2011.\nThe book explained the psychology of decision-making. It outlines two systems that drive the way humans think and make choices - the fast, intuitive, and emotional - and the slower, more deliberative, and more logical.\nThe book argued that most of the time, our fast, intuitive mind is in control, and takes charge of the decisions we make each day - rather than the deliberative, logical part of our minds - and this is where mistakes can creep in.",

    "Ukraine is exporting about five million tonnes of grain a month - much more than in the summer of 2023, when Russia pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal.\nRussia stopped giving safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine in July of that year, and as a result, the country's grain exports slumped.\nHow much grain is Ukraine exporting?\nUkraine exported 5.8 million tonnes of grain in February 2024, and 5.3 million tonnes in January.\nHowever the amount exported in March dropped back - with 4.5 million tonnes sent between 1 - 27 March.\nBefore Russia's invasion in 2022, the country was sending about 6.5 million tonnes abroad every month .\nAfter Russia pulled of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (or \"grain deal\"), it said it would view any vessel bound for Ukraine as a potential military target.\nFew cargo ships dared to go to Ukrainian ports, and monthly grain exports fell to just over 2 million tonnes in July, August and September 2023 .\nHowever, Ukraine has since established new export routes.\nBetween the end of the grain deal in July 2023 and the end of February 2024, it shipped about 20 million tonnes of grain to 42 countries , according to the country's vice prime minister Oleksandr Kubrakov.\nThis is despite 30 Russian attacks on Ukrainian grain ports and storage facilities since the deal ended.\nWhy do Ukrainian food exports matter?\nBefore Russia's invasion in February 2022, Ukraine was the world's seventh largest exporter of wheat, fourth largest exporter of barley, and the biggest exporter of sunflower seeds (used for sunflower oil and feed).\nWhen the war started, Ukraine's exports slumped and world prices for grain soared . This particularly affected people in the world's poorest countries.\nThe more grain that Ukraine has been able to supply to global markets, the lower prices have gone .\nFoodstuffs are a major earner for Ukraine. In 2021, the year before Russia's invasion, it made $27.8bn (\u00c2\u00a323.8bn) from exports .\nWhat are Ukraine's new routes for grain exports?\nUnder the grain deal, cargo ships travelled to and from Ukrainian ports along a 357-mile (574km) corridor across the Black Sea to the Bosphorus Strait.\nAfter that deal ended, Ukraine established a new \"temporary export corridor\" in August 2023, which hugs the western coastline.\nThis is a relatively safe route for cargo ships because the waters there are too shallow for Russian submarines to operate .\nIt also passes through the territorial waters of Romania and Bulgaria, two Nato countries.\nUnder the EU's \"solidarity lanes\" scheme , Ukraine is also sending grain by land and barge to ports on the River Danube, or to the Romanian port of Constanta, to be loaded onto cargo ships which then travel through the Black Sea.\nMore Ukrainian grain is also being exported to Europe to be sold on arrival, or to be shipped onwards from other European ports.\nHow has Ukraine responded to Russia's naval blockade?\nUkrainian armed forces have carried out repeated attacks on Russian naval ships and bases in the Black Sea, using aerial drones, sea drones and long-range missiles.\nUkraine's navy claims it has hit or disabled a third of all the ships in Russia's Black Sea fleet since the war began.\nThis has meant Russia is now putting fewer ships near the Ukrainian coast to blockade it .\nWhat problems have Ukraine's grain exports caused in neighbouring countries?\nTo help Ukraine's economy after the Russian invasion, the EU scrapped tariffs on imports from the country.\nHowever, countries in eastern Europe complained that this meant Ukrainian grain was flooding their markets, lowering wholesale prices and hitting the incomes of their farmers.\nSome dealers had decided to sell the grain in these countries rather than ship it overseas from other European ports.\nAccording to the EU's agriculture commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, 4.1 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain entered Poland between April 2022 and March 2023 , and 3.4 million tonnes of that stayed in the country.\nIn May 2022, the European Commission introduced a ban on Ukrainian grain sales in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, only allowing grain meant for transit to enter those countries.\nIt lifted the restrictions in September 2023, saying the problem had been solved.\nHowever, Poland has since imposed its own ban on Ukrainian grain imports, and Polish farmers have been blockading border crossings with Ukraine .\nIn March 2024, the European Commission proposed a cap on duty-free imports of some Ukrainian produce , including oats, eggs, poultry and sugar.\nHowever it confirmed that all other Ukrainian imports into the EU - including wheat and barley - would remain free of duties until at least June 2025.\nIt is also proposing to increase tariffs on imports of Russian and Belorusian grain to reduce surpluses in eastern European countries.",
    "Opposition leader Bassirou Diomaye Faye is leading the race in Senegal's presidential election, according to local media.\nSeveral of the 17 candidates have conceded to him, however official results have not yet been announced.\nMillions took part in a peaceful vote on Sunday, following three years of turbulence and opposition protests against the incumbent, Macky Sall.\nThe ruling coalition's choice, Amadou Ba, has denied that he has lost.\nHe said he expected to contest a run-off vote to decide a winner. This would be required if no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote.\nMr Faye, 44, a senior official in the Pastef party led by Ousmane Sonko, had been in jail until 10 days before the vote. Mr Sonko was disqualified from the race because of a defamation conviction, which he said was politically motivated.\nThe first set of tallies announced on television showed Mr Faye had won the majority of votes, triggering widespread street celebrations in the capital, Dakar.\nSupporters set off fireworks, waved Senegalese flags and blew vuvuzelas.\nThe results led to five opposition candidates declaring Mr Faye the winner. Anta Babacar Ngom, the only female candidate, wished Mr Faye success in a statement.\nMr Faye has not yet commented.\nThe results being announced are from local media tallying the results posted outside individual polling stations.\nIt is not clear how many of the 15,633 polling stations have been counted so far. Official results are expected by Tuesday.\nMr Sonko backed Mr Faye, the co-creator of his now dissolved Pastef party, who was also detained almost a year ago on charges including defamation and contempt of court.\nAn amnesty law passed this month allowed their release days before the vote.\nThey have campaigned together under the banner \"Diomaye is Sonko\". Some high-profile politicians and opposition candidates have backed Mr Faye's candidacy.\n\"The population is choosing between continuation and rupture,\" Mr Faye said after casting his vote, urging contenders to accept the winner.\nPrepare for run-off\nMr Sall, the incumbent, was not on the ballot for the first time in Senegal's history. His ruling coalition picked Mr Ba, 62, a former prime minister.\nMr Ba's campaign said that \"considering the feedback of the results from our team of experts, we are certain that, in the worst-case scenario, we will go to a run-off\".\nAbout 7.3 million people were registered to vote in the country of around 18 million.\nThe election had been due to take place last month but Mr Sall postponed it, triggering deadly opposition protests.\nMore on Senegal's election:",

    "A New York judge placed Donald Trump under a gag order ahead of his criminal hush money case that begins 15 April.\nHe is barred from making public statements about court staff, jurors, witnesses and lawyers in the district attorney's office - or their families.\nThe gag order does not apply to the district attorney.\nThe Trump campaign said the order, which is limited in some instances, violated his free speech rights.\nIn several instances, the order requires that the comments would have to be \"made with the intent to materially interfere\" with the case.\nJustice Juan Merchan granted the limited gag order after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg requested it.\nEarlier today, Mr Trump attacked Justice Merchan's daughter on his Truth Social account, and called the judge a \"certified Trump hater\".\nMr Trump faces 34 felony counts in connection with hush money payments allegedly made to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star, ahead of the 2016 election.\nHe has pleaded not guilty and called the case politically motivated.\nIn his order, Justice Merchan wrote that he had considered Mr Trump's constitutional free speech rights, but concluded that the former president's \"extrajudicial statements went far beyond defending himself against 'attacks' by 'public figures'\".\nInstead, Justice Merchan said he had found Mr Trump's \"statements were threatening, inflammatory, denigrating\" and led to fear and increased security requirements for those targeted.\nMr Bragg had asked the court to issue a gag order in February, citing the former president's \"longstanding and singular history\" of attacking his opponents.\nMr Trump's attorneys argued, however, that he is \"the presumptive Republican nominee and leading candidate in the 2024 election\". They said that it would be \"unconstitutional and unlawful\" to impose restrictions on his speech.\nJustice Merchan is not the first judge to impose such restrictions on Mr Trump.\nThe former president has frequently attacked prosecutors and court staffers involved in his myriad of legal cases. At times, it has served to galvanize his supporters.\nA judge in an earlier civil case involving his real estate companies placed Mr Trump under a gag order after he attacked a court clerk via social media. He also twice fined the former president for violating the order.\nMr Trump must pay a $454m bond that came as a result of that civil fraud trial. An appeals court temporarily slashed that payment to $175m on Monday.",
    "The boss of Thames Water has told the BBC customer bills need to rise by 40% by 2030 to pay for improvements.\n\"That is the price customers have to pay for the investment in our infrastructure that's needed,\" he said.\nThe firm is in a race to find extra cash after its investors said they would not give the struggling water giant more money unless bills rise.\nThe regulator, whose approval is needed for any price rises, has so far pushed back on substantial bill increases.\nSources close to Ofwat say it plans to \"stick to its guns\" and won't raise bills to address shareholder problems.\nFears emerged last year that the UK's largest water company Thames could collapse due to its huge debts.\nRegardless of what happens, water supplies will continue as normal.\nChris Weston said he wanted to \"reassure our customers that it is very much business as usual for Thames Water\".\nThe firm was \"quite a long way off\" from nationalisation and \"a lot that has to happen\" beforehand.\nHowever, he said it was \"eventually possible\".\n\"Even if that were to happen, the services will continue to be provided,\" he said. \"There will still be clean drinking water, and we will still deal with all the waste that has to be dealt with.\"\nThames Water drew up a turnaround plan last summer which asked for bills to rise over the next five years.\nInvestors were due to pump in almost \u00c2\u00a34bn into the business over the next two years, but have withheld the first payment - due at the end of March - saying its turnaround plan is \"uninvestible\".\nThe government has previously said it is ready to take over Thames Water in the event that it collapses. It serves 15 million households, mostly across London and parts of southern England.\nThe regulator insists that even without the additional capital, the Thames Water operating company will not need to be nationalised immediately as it is still generating enough money to keep it going day-to-day for up to 18 months.\nHowever, at some point Thames will need to raise new money to finance the huge programme of investment that is needed and if the current shareholders - which include domestic and foreign pension funds as well as wealth funds from China and Abu Dhabi - won't inject cash, then Thames will need to find new ones.\nSources close to the current owners say that unless Thames can pay a return - few people will find it an attractive investment.\nIt is not unusual for investors to try to put pressure on the regulator, which is in the process of deciding how much water companies will be able to charge customers from 2025 to 2030.\nHowever, the BBC understands that some investors, who stand to lose significant amounts if the firm is nationalised, don't think regulators will let the firm raise prices enough to make Thames Water a prospect for further investment.\n'Balancing act'\nMr Weston said that Thames Water was planning to come up with a plan that is acceptable to investors - who want higher returns - and Ofwat - which said it had to be \"fair to bill payers\".\n\"It is a balancing act,\" Mr Weston said.\nOfwat wants the company to clean up its act when it comes to the environment, and improve customer service.\nLevelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said \"the answer is not to hit consumers\" and that \"leadership of Thames Water has been a disgrace\". He said successive management teams at Thames Water had \"taken advantage\" of customers by \"taking out profits and not investing\".\nBut Labour said it was the government which had \"weakened regulation allowing water companies to get massively in debt while the sewerage system crumbled and illegal sewage dumping hit record levels\".\nThe GMB union said investors were trying to \"blackmail\" customers and Ofwat so bills can \"rocket\".\nThames Water is heavily indebted, with a large proportion of its \u00c2\u00a314.7bn debt pile having been run up when it was owned by Macquarie, an Australian infrastructure bank.\nInterest payments on its debt have also sharply increased.\nMacquarie has said that it invested billions of pounds in upgrading Thames's water and sewerage infrastructure while it owned the company.\nBut critics argue that it took billions of pounds out of the company in loans and dividends - which is a share of a business's profits that is paid to shareholders.\nAlong with many UK water firms, Thames Water has been in the spotlight for pumping sewage into rivers.\nBetween 2020 and the end of last year, it discharged at least 72 billion litres of sewage into the Thames.\nOfwat said safeguards were in place to ensure that services to customers were protected \"regardless of issues faced by shareholders of Thames Water\".\n\"The company must now pursue all options to seek further equity for the business to turn around the performance of the company for customers.  \"We also need to see companies deliver the performance that customers expect and that they are run in a way that meets customers' expectations,\" it added.",

they just change\".\n\"But they can always be met if we cleave to those fundamental values which have served this nation well - hope, enterprise, equality of opportunity, integrity, security,\" he added.\nHe said those values mean \"everything\" to him.\n\"I believe in public service and the power of politics to make a difference and to make people's lives better,\" he said.\nWith a general Irish election due by March 2025, Mr Harris also hit out at Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in - the party seen as potentially Fine Gael's biggest electoral threat.\n\"Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in can't bear to look back over what Fine Gael has achieved since pulling our economy back from the brink,\" he said. \"Always seeking to denigrate our service in government by denying reality.\"\nPossibly the biggest cheer of the speech came after Mr Harris said the party \"stands for law and order\" and referred to the funeral of convicted police officer killer Pearse McAuley last week.\nMcAuley was jailed for 14 years for the manslaughter of Det Garda Jerry McCabe in 1996, a crime he committed as a member of the Provisional IRA - during the conflict in Northern Ireland, Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in were the IRA's political wing.\nMr Harris added: \"In a week where I saw the tricolour of this republic draped over the coffin of a garda killer, I say shame - let's take our flag back.\"\nWhat did Simon Harris say about Israel and Gaza?\nLater, Mr Harris followed his predecessor , Leo Varadkar, in calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.\n\"Fine Gael stands as a party unafraid to speak truth to power about the catastrophe we are witnessing in Gaza and to voice in no uncertain terms the moral outrage of the Irish people.\" he said.\n\"I repeat my calls today for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the immediate release of all hostages, an end to violence in the Middle East and a political process to bring about a two state solution.\"\nMr Harris also thanked his family, and paid tribute to his parents, wife Caoimhe and children Saoirse and Cillian.\n\"My mother used to tell us that success is about liking what you do.\n\"My parents gave up so much and worked so hard for us and today I thank them for that.\" he said.\nBefore Mr Harris was confirmed as Fine Gael's new leader, deputy leader Simon Coveney said Mr Harris will provide \"new energy, new ideas, new drive and new togetherness\" and that he will have the party's full support \"to give him the maximum chances of success\".\nWhy was there a leadership contest?\nOn Wednesday, Leo Varadkar caused shock when he announced he would be stepping down as Fine Gael leader immediately , and would resign as taoiseach as soon as his successor was selected.\nHe said he was resigning for \"personal and political reasons\" and was \"not the best person for the job anymore\".\nHe also denied any \"conspiracy theories\" over the decision , telling reporters in Brussels there was no ulterior motive or new job on the cards.\nMr Varadkar's resignation paved the way for a party leadership contest, but as he heads the current coalition government alongside Fianna F\u00c3\u00a1il and the Green Party in Dublin, his successor is also expected to take over as taoiseach.\nWho is Simon Harris?\nAt 37, Mr Harris is set to make history as Ireland's youngest taoiseach - taking over the top role a year younger than his predecessor did in 2017.\nHe first entered the D\u00c3\u00a1il (lower house of Irish parliament) over a decade ago at the age of 24 as TD (MP) for Wicklow.\nMr Harris has had a rapid rise through the party ranks, landing his first cabinet role, as health minister, five years later in 2016.\nIn this role, he oversaw the Republi",
    "The man in charge of compensating sexual abuse victims of Japan's most famous pop manager says the scandal goes further than first thought.\nNoriyuki Higashiyama told the BBC he believes there were two more perpetrators at Johnny Kitagawa's agency Johnny & Associates.\nHe believes these individuals are still alive.\nSince a 2023 BBC investigation , nearly 1,000 men have come forward to say they were abused by Kitagawa.\nHigashiyama told the BBC that an internal investigation by the former company in August 2023 had concluded that two people at Johnny & Associates were believed to have sexually abused talent.\nHe revealed that, to date, he has not contacted the authorities.\n\"From a legal standpoint, I don't think we have the authority to do that,\" Higashiyama says. \"But if those involved file a criminal complaint, I imagine we would co-operate as much as possible.\"\nHe says that he does not know if the survivors of abuse by the two perpetrators want to pursue criminal proceedings.\n\"I don't even know who they are,\" he says.\nJohnny Kitagawa, creator of the Japanese boy band phenomenon, died in 2019. At the time, he was celebrated for his contribution to the country's pop culture.\nIn the wake of the BBC documentary, an independent inquiry concluded that the music mogul had abused hundreds of boys and young men over a six-decade career.\nJohnny & Associates was dissolved and replaced by a new talent agency called Starto Entertainment and Smile-Up, a company tasked with processing claims of abuse.\nSmile-Up appointed three former judges to a victim relief committee to manage the compensation process.\nHigashiyama, a former actor and Johnny & Associates talent, took on the job as Smile-Up's CEO. He has himself faced allegations of bullying and sexual abuse, which he denies.\nSurvivors of Kitagawa's abuse have criticised Smile-Up for having an opaque compensation process and for not acting quickly enough to engage with them. They say it seems to be an ad-hoc system with no defined timeline.\nAkimasa Nihongi is a former Johnny & Associates talent and joined the agency as a 13-year-old with aspirations of becoming a pop star.\nHe went public with his own experience of abuse when he saw the story reported in 2023.\n\"I feel like there are still issues that are hidden,\" he says.\nFor Akimasa and many more like him, there is little semblance of justice. A lawyer representing survivors of Kitagawa's abuse described Smile-Up's process as \"a black-box situation\".\nSmile-Up has itself cast doubt on some of the allegations. Days after being set up, the agency released a statement saying: \"We have received information that there are cases in which people, who are most likely not victims, are telling false stories using the testimony of real victims.\"\nSome of the survivors who shared their experiences have faced condemnation and harassment from people online.\nA woman who did not want to be identified says her husband faced death threats and harassment when he shared his story of being abused by Kitagawa.\n\"He wanted to reveal everything,\" she says. \"He didn't want future children to be harmed in the same way.\"\nAfter he spoke out, his personal details were exposed online.\nEventually the woman received a text message from her husband telling her that he'd gone to the mountains. It was there that he ended his life.\n\"When I found him, it was too late,\" she says.\nSmile-Up CEO Noriyuki Higashiyama says that he is aware of this case.\n\"People have freedom of speech,\" he says. \"I'm not encouraging slander. If it's possible, I would really like to eliminate online abuse.\"\nOur World: The Shadow of a Predator\nAfter the BBC revealed that Johnny Kitagawa, the godfather of J-pop, spent a lifetime sexually abusing young boys in his talent agency, Mobeen Azhar investigates the aftermath of a predator.\nWatch on BBC News at 03:30 on Saturday March 30 or afterwards on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)\nHigashiyama says he has spoken personally to almost 200 people who have come forward with claims of abuse.\n\"I hope it will help to mend their hearts, even just a little. I consider that to be my role. My main focus is to meet with survivors.\"\nHe admits that he has no formal training or experience in counselling or helping survivors of sexual abuse.\nSmile-Up is organising and funding counselling for those who have come forward. \"We are thinking of doing that indefinitely,\" Higashiyama says.\nSubsequent to revelations in the BBC investigation, Kitagawa's place in Japanese pop culture has shifted in the public consciousness.\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida has faced increasing pressure to reform sexual abuse legislation.\nThe age of consent in Japan shifted from 13 to 16 , after multiple rape acquittals in 2019 caused a national outcry.\nAnd public discussion following last year's investigation into Kitawaga has resulted in more men speaking publicly about the abuse they experienced.\nHowever, some survivors of abuse feel that despite their testimonies, justice continues to be elusive.\nA",
    "One year ago Danielle Gershkovich got a call from her mother. She could hardly believe the news.\nHer younger brother, Evan, a reporter with the Wall Street Journal, had just been arrested: he was the first US journalist in Russia since the Cold War to be charged with espionage. The maximum possible punishment: 20 years in prison.\n\"It's been a really difficult year,\" Danielle tells me by video call from Washington. \"The uncertainty is very hard to deal with.\"\nWriting letters helps. The jailed American journalist has been sending plenty from prison.\n\"The best way to support one another is to keep things light,\" Danielle says. \"We have a lot of sibling banter back and forth, a lot of teasing with love.\n\"I recently asked him if it's OK for me see the Dune movie, the sequel. I felt guilty about seeing it, because he can't.\"\nEvan's ordeal began one thousand miles from Moscow in the city of Yekaterinburg. On a reporting trip there, he was detained by the FSB, Russia's domestic security service. The Russian authorities say the American was \"caught red-handed\" with \"classified information\". He, his employer and the US authorities fiercely deny the spying charge.\nLocked away in a Russian jail, Evan is still managing to surprise his family.\n\"On International Women's Day he arranged for the women in his life to receive bouquets. We want him to focus on himself and there he was taking care of us. He supports the people in his life. We really miss him.\"\nSince Evan Gershkovich's arrest, here in Moscow we have had few opportunities to see him.\nTrue, he has made several court appearances in the last 12 months. And sometimes the media is allowed in to film him.\nFor no longer than a minute.\nFor us, that is just enough time to get a rough sense of how Evan is holding up.\nFor Evan, it is a chance to spot some familiar faces.\nBut when Evan appeared in court this week no journalists were let in. No explanation was given. Instead, the Moscow City Courthouse filmed and released its own footage of the American journalist as he stood in the courtroom in a glass cage.\nThat video was just six seconds long.\nAt the end of the hearing a judge ruled that Evan Gershkovich must stay in pre-trial detention.\n\"It's just complete, total and utter nonsense. Evan is not a spy. He's a journalist,\" Emma Tucker, editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal, tells me.\n\"Like a lot of reporters a year ago, people were already wary about reporting from Russia. News outlets had begun to withdraw correspondents. They were treading very carefully. So, the arrangement with Evan was that he was based in London and was going in [to Russia] for two or three weeks at a time, and then coming out again.\n\"He'd been writing a lot of interesting reports on the state of the Russian economy in light of the Ukraine war. This was the sort of piece he was doing.\"\nEvan Gershkovich is being kept in Moscow's Lefortovo jail. Built in Tsarist times, it has held some of Russia's most high-profile inmates  over the years, including political prisoners and dissidents. During the Great Terror of Joseph Stalin, torture and execution were commonplace. Former inmates have spoken of an unnerving sensation of total isolation.\n\"He is managing. He is in good health,\" says US ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, one of the few people allowed to visit Evan in Lefortovo.\n\"One of the things that has really struck me is how important correspondence has been for him. Corresponding with his family, friends and people he has never met before has really energised him. It gives him focus and something to work for in terms of the day when he gets out.\"\nThe US government has designated Evan Gershkovich \"wrongfully detained.\"\n\"The insinuation that he was somehow engaging in some kind of criminal activity is just flat-out false,\" insists Ambassador Tracy. \"The message is: release him now.\"\nReferring to Evan Gershkovich last month, Vladimir Putin said that he would \"like him to go home eventually. I say this sincerely.\"\nBut there is a \"but\".\nFrom the unsubtle hints Moscow's been dropping, it is clear that the Kremlin wants something - or rather someone - in return. That someone is thought to be FSB security service officer Vadim Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence for murder in Germany.\nThe Russian authorities barely hide the fact that they see Evan Gershkovich as a bargaining chip.\n\"I think it's pretty clear that [Evan] was picked up in order to be traded,\" believes Emma Tucker.\n\"It's often referred to as hostage diplomacy, which I absolutely hate because there's nothing diplomatic about what's going on. Evan is a hostage. He is a bargaining chip. Putin is holding him as currency. And that is just the brutal reality of it. It makes it very difficult for governments to know how to approach this. Because there's a lot at stake here, including what might happen in the future.\"\n\"Russia is stockpiling Americans in its jails in order to be able to trade them at a later date,\" says Emma Tucker.\nAnd Russia kn",
    "Saudi Arabia has announced it will build a theme park based on the famed Japanese animated series Dragon Ball, sparking mixed reactions from fans.\nIt will feature a 70m (229.6ft) dragon at its centre and at least 30 rides, the firm behind the project says.\nThe park would be the world's first such attraction based on the popular media franchise.\nThe announcement was met with some criticism from fans, citing Saudi Arabia's human rights record.\nThe park will cover more than half a million square metres, according to Qiddiya Investment Company (QIC) which is wholly owned by the Saudi Arabian government's investment fund.\nThe plans are part of \"a long-term strategic partnership\" between the QIC and Toei Animation, the Japanese producer of Dragon Ball.\nAccording to the official Dragon Ball website, the park will include a roller coaster inside the dragon modelled after Shenron, a wish-giving dragon that features in the franchise.\nQiddiya is a major entertainment and tourism project being built near Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh.\nIt is part of the energy-rich nation's plans to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels.\nWhile some Dragon Ball fans have welcomed the plans for the theme park, others on social media have questioned the decision to locate the attraction in Saudi Arabia.\nThe country has been criticised for its human rights record, treatment of women and lack of recognition of LGBTQ+ rights.\nThe announcement comes just weeks after the death of Dragon Ball's creator, Akira Toriyama.\nToriyama died on 1 March, aged 68. Only his family and very few friends attended his funeral, according to a statement on the Dragon Ball website.\nFans around the world paid tribute to Toriyama for creating characters that have become a part of their lives.\nThe Dragon Ball comic series debuted in 1984. It follows a boy named Son Goku in his quest to collect magical dragon balls that can give him super powers.\nIt is one of the most influential and best-selling Japanese comics of all time.",
    "A hospital nursery nurse who has made a \"huge difference to many families\" has celebrated 45 years of service.\nSue Sheriton, from south Bristol, works at St Michael's Hospital in the city.\nHer colleagues on ward 76 described her as \"absolutely amazing and invaluable\" and marked the milestone by buying her flowers, a card and a cake.\n\"It's been a privilege looking after mums and dads in Bristol. I've learned lots of different things,\" said Ms Sheriton.\nAfter qualifying as a nursery nurse, her early career saw her work as a cleaner and in a cinema.\nIt was only when she realised that not working in nursing was a \"waste of experience\" that she made the transition into her current role.\nHer duties involve caring for and looking after newborn babies, feeding them, and helping new parents navigate their first few days with children.\nBathed, cuddled and cared\nReflecting on her time in the job, she said: \"Every day you go to work and feel like you've helped somebody.\n\"You've learned something new from people because you get valuable experience from parents as well - especially from different cultures.\"\nDespite having two children of her own and six grandchildren, Ms Sheriton has no intention of leaving her role.\n\"If I stopped working now and I didn't meet people, I think it would drive me crazy,\" she said.\nThe hospital paid tribute to Ms Sheriton's dedication, knowledge and hard work, saying she had \"bathed, cuddled and cared for so many of the babies born in Bristol over the years\".\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "A disabled woman whose actions led to the death of a pensioner cycling on a pavement has been released from prison pending an appeal against her conviction.\nAuriol Grey, 50, shouted towards retired midwife Celia Ward, 77, causing her to fall into the road in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, in 2020.\nGrey was given a three-year jail term for unlawful manslaughter last year.\nA Court of Appeal official told the BBC that she had been released on bail.\nThree judges gave Grey, of Bradbury Place, Huntingdon, the go-ahead to appeal against her conviction at a recent Court of Appeal hearing in London.\nA bail application was granted and judges are expected to oversee a full appeal hearing in May.\nShe is understood to have returned home.\nThe Court of Appeal heard Grey was charged with unlawful act manslaughter, which required that an unlawful action should take place to cause death.\nHer lawyers argued that no such action was considered by the jury at the original trial.\n\"Auriol Grey is an autistic, disabled person with impaired vision,\" said solicitor Ben Rose.\n\"In a case such as this, the prosecution is required to prove to the jury that she intended to cause Mrs Ward harm, or fear of harm.\n\"We say this did not happen, and as a result will ask the Court of Appeal when the case is heard in May to quash Ms Grey's conviction.\"\nThe two women passed each other in opposite directions on a pavement on 20 October, 2020.\nIn CCTV footage, Grey could be heard shouting at grandmother Mrs Ward, telling her to get off the pavement, before she and her bicycle fall into the road.\nMrs Ward died at the scene.\nThe trial heard that Grey had cerebral palsy and was partially sighted, but Judge Sean Enright said: \"These actions are not explained by disability.\"\nJudges had dismissed Grey's previous application for leave to appeal her sentence in May 2023, saying it was \"not arguably manifestly excessive\".\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "The family of the man who died in a crash on the M4 motorway have said he will be \"greatly missed\".\nStephen Abbott, 56, of Carmarthenshire, crashed into a stationary lorry on the eastbound carriageway near Hendy at 23:20 GMT on Monday 18 March.\nBoth vehicles caught fire following the crash and the road was closed for about 15 hours.\nDyfed-Powys Police officers are still investigating what happened.\nIn a statement Mr Abbot's family said he was \"a larger than life character\" whose sudden death had left them \"heartbroken\".\nBrought up in Porthcawl, he lived in the Bridgend area before moving to Carmarthenshire.\nHe was well-known for working with the Bar 44 group in Cowbridge for more than 20 years, along with the Parador 44 boutique hotel in Cardiff.\nMr Abbott is said to have left his home in Gorslas in his blue-grey Kia Ceed at about 21:45 on the evening of the crash.\nHe travelled eastbound along the M4 and then through Hendy, Pontarddulais, and Pontlliw, before turning around and travelling back to Pont Abraham to re-join the motorway.\nPolice are appealing for anyone with any information about Mr Abbott in the run-up to the crash to contact them.\nSpecialist officers are currently supporting his relatives.",
    "Thailand has taken a historic step closer to marriage equality after the lower house passed a bill giving legal recognition to same-sex marriage.\nIt still needs approval from the Senate and royal endorsement to become law.\nBut it is widely expected to happen by the end of 2024, making Thailand the only South East Asian country to recognise same-sex unions.\nIt will cement Thailand's reputation as a relative haven for LGBTQ+ couples in a region where such attitudes are rare.\n\"This is the beginning of equality. It's not a universal cure to every problem but it's the first step towards equality,\" Danuphorn Punnakanta, an MP and chairman of the lower house's committee on marriage equality, told parliament while presenting a draft of the bill. \"This law wants to return these rights to this group of people, not grant them the rights.\"\nThe new law, which was passed by 400 of 415 of lawmakers present, will describe marriage as a partnership between two individuals, instead of between a man and woman. And it will give LGBTQ+ couples equal rights to get marital tax savings, to inherit property, and to give medical treatment consent for partners who are incapacitated.\nUnder the law, married same-sex couples can also adopt children. However, the lower house did not adopt the committee's suggestion to use the term \"parents\" instead of \"fathers and mothers\".\nThailand already has laws that ban discrimination over gender identity and sexual orientation and is, therefore, seen as one of Asia's most LGBTQ+ friendly nations.\nBut it has taken many years of campaigning for same-sex couples to come this close to marriage equality.\nPast attempts to legalise same-sex marriage failed despite broad public support. A government survey late last year showed that 96.6% of those polled were in favour of the bill.\n\"Yes, I'm watching the parliamentary debate and keeping my fingers crossed,\" says Phisit Sirihirunchai, a 35-year-old openly gay police officer. \"I'm glad and already excited that it is really going to happen. I am coming closer and closer to seeing my dreams come true.\"\nPhisit said he and his partner, who have been together for more than five years, have been planning to get married on the day the law comes into effect.\n\"I feel that equality has happened today. It's a historic day for the Thai parliament that stands to fight for the rights of LGBTQI+,\" said Tunyawaj Kamolwongwat, a gay MP from the opposition Move Forward party who has been campaigning for marriage equality in the past decade.\nSeveral political parties promised to recognise same-sex unions as part of their campaign before last year's election. Prime Minister Sretta Thavisin has also been vocal in his support since taking office in September last year.\nIn December, the lower house passed four proposed bills to recognise same-sex marriage - one was put forward by Mr Thavisin's administration and three came from opposition parties. These were then combined into a single bill, which the lower house passed on Wednesday.\nHowever, the Thai parliament has so far rejected proposals to allow people to change their gender identity, despite the high visibility of transgender communities here.\nThailand still stands out in South East Asia, where same-sex intimacy is criminalised in some countries. It is also an outlier in Asia.\nIn 2019, Taiwan's parliament became the first in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage. Nepal registered its first same-sex union in November last year, five months after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of it.\nThis was just one month after India's top court had ruled against it , leaving the decision to the government, which said it would set up a panel that would decide on more legal rights for same-sex couples.\nThe LGBTQ+ community has also been fighting for marriage equality in Japan, where district courts have ruled that the ban is unconstitutional . Polls show public support for it but stiff opposition from older, traditional ranks of the ruling party has stymied efforts.\nSingapore scrapped a colonial-era law that banned gay sex in 2022, but also amended its constitution to prevent the courts from challenging the definition of marriage as one between a man and a woman.\nAdditional reporting by the BBC's Thanyarat Doksone in Bangkok",
    "News programmes at Scottish broadcaster STV could be blacked out because of a 24 hour strike by journalists.\nMembers of the NUJ union at the company want a 6% pay rise.\nThe broadcaster says its pay offer - which has been accepted by other staff at the company- is fair and affordable.\nNetwork programmes and commercials will be broadcast as usual. If the dispute is not resolved, another one-day strike will take place next month.\nThursday's news bulletins and the current affairs programme Scotland Tonight are at risk and could be replaced by other material. Online news services will also likely be affected.\nIt is understood that no attempt will be made to produce news bulletins, including the main STV News at Six, using staff who are not on strike.\nThere will be pickets outside STV's studios in Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen and a demonstration outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.\nThe NUJ is seeking a 6% rise for members to help keep pace with inflation.\nThe union argues salaries for journalists at the company have fallen behind the pay for equivalent roles at the BBC and ITV, which runs the rest of the channel three network.\n'Award-winning journalism'\nNick McGowan-Lowe, the union's national organiser for Scotland, said: \"Journalists at STV have not just been reporting on the cost-of-living crisis - they've been experiencing it too.\n\"Our members across Scotland produce the award-winning journalism that is the flagship of the STV brand and are only asking for their pay to keep track with inflation.\n\"Simon Pitts, STV chief executive, was paid over \u00c2\u00a3900,000 from the company last year - and only a small fraction of that would settle this dispute.

He was my hero.\"\nSherry was granted bail as he was told he will be sentenced on 1 May.\nAdjourning the case for a pre-sentence report, Judge David Swinnerton told him: \"I have heard quite a lot about your karate career but I need to get more background information about you.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

At least 30 hostages are presumed dead.\nAbout 300 people took part in Tuesday's demonstration outside the Israeli military's headquarters in Tel Aviv - some of them locked in cages, some with placards saying \"no price is too high\".\nIsraeli police said they had arrested four protesters \"following a disturbance\".\n\"The police acted with the required sensitivity and allowed the protest of some of the hostages' families even though it was not legal,\" a statement added. \"However, some of the protesters decided to go down to Ayalon Highway and block traffic, endangering motorists and themselves.\"\nIsraeli media said two of those arrested were relatives of 79-year-old hostage Avraham Munder.\nThey included his nephew, Shahar Mor Zahiro, who later confirmed in a video outside a police station that he had been held for almost three hours.\nMr Munder was kidnapped along with his wife Ruth, his daughter Keren, and his grandson Ohad, when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\nRuth, Keren and Ohad were released during a week-long ceasefire in November under a deal that saw 105 hostages - most of them women and children - freed in return for some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.\nIsraeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said the state \"should show much more compassion and sensitivity to the families of the hostages\".\n\"They and their families were abandoned, and their fight is the most just fight there is,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter . \"The minimum is to let them scream out their cries.\"\nThere have been almost daily demonstrations by the hostages' families, but their anguish has been heightened by the news that Israeli officials have been recalled from the talks in Doha mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US.\nOn Tuesday, one senior Israeli official close to Mossad director David Barnea - who is heading the Israeli negotiating team - told Reuters news agency that they were \"at a dead end\" because of Hamas's demands.\nIsrael had agreed to double to 700 or 800 the number of Palestinian prisoners it would release in exchange for 40 hostages - including elderly people, women, children and the sick - and also to allow some displaced Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza, the official said.\nHamas said on Monday that it had rejected the latest truce proposal and that it was sticking to its original position calling for a permanent ceasefire that would lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\nThe Israeli prime minister's office said Hamas's stance demonstrated its \"utter disinterest\" in a deal and that it showed the \"damage\" done by a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire.\nBut the US said the Israeli statement was \"inaccurate in almost every respect and it is unfair to the hostages and their families\" because Hamas's response had been \"prepared before the UN Security Council vote\".\nQatar meanwhile insisted the talks were \"ongoing\" and \"have not stopped\".\nA halt to the fighting seems as far off as ever on the ground in Gaza, where more than 32,490 people have been killed since the start of the war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nAmid the rising risk of a man-made famine in the north because only a trickle of aid is getting in, this week has again seen crowds waiting for airdrops of food along the coast.\nHowever, at least 18 people are said to have died, with graphic videos showing some drowning as they tried to retrieve aid packages from the sea, with others said to have been killed in stampedes.",
    "Catherine, Princess of Wales, says she is having treatment for cancer which was discovered following major abdominal surgery. She started preventative chemotherapy in late February.\nWhen was the cancer found?\nThe princess underwent surgery in January. The palace did not disclose details at the time but said the procedure was planned and her condition was \"not cancer-related\".\nHer video message says that tests carried out after the operation found cancer had been present.\nWhat type of cancer does the princess have?\nKensington Palace has not said what type of cancer she has.\nA spokesperson said: \"We will not be sharing any further private medical information. The princess has a right to medical privacy as we all do.\"\nWhat is preventative chemotherapy?\nCatherine said her medical team advised she should undergo \"preventative chemotherapy\" and she is in the early stages of this treatment.\nChemotherapy is a catch-all term for medication to kill cancer cells - it can be given via a drip or in pill form.\nProf Andrew Beggs, a consultant colorectal surgeon, said: \"Preventive chemotherapy after surgery is given to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back in the future.\"\nHow much you need and how often depends on the type of cancer and how it is growing.\nHow did doctors find the cancer?\nAfter the surgery in January, which Kensington Palace says was successful, doctors performed tests which revealed cancer had been present.\nCommonly, tissue removed during surgery would be sent to a lab for analysis and to see what cells are there.\nIs she getting treatment privately or on the NHS?\nCatherine's original operation took place at the London Clinic, a private facility.\nThe Palace is not commenting on where she is now receiving care. In her video message Catherine thanked the \"fantastic medical team\" who have been treating her.\nWhat is cancer?\nCancer occurs when cells in a specific part of the body divide in an uncontrolled way.\nUntreated, these cells can potentially spread to other tissues in the body, including organs, which is known as secondary or metastatic cancer.\nHow many people get cancer?\nIn the UK, one in two people develop some kind of cancer during their lifetime.\nThere are more than 200 different types of cancer - the most common ones in the UK are breast, lung, prostate and bowel, according to the NHS UK website .\nEach cancer is diagnosed and treated in a particular way.\nAnyone can develop cancer, but the risk goes up the older we become because there's more time for cell damage to build up.\nMost cases of cancer are in people aged 50 and over. In the UK, a third of all cases are in people aged 75 and over .\nSurvival from cancer has doubled in the last 50 years.\nWhat should you do if you think you have cancer?\nIf you notice something that isn't normal for you, see a doctor.\nThat might include:\nThe symptoms you are experiencing may not be cancer, but it is important to get checked.\nFinding cancer early can often make it easier to treat.",
    "Rishi Sunak has attacked Sir Keir Starmer for \"arrogantly\" taking voters for granted and \"assuming he can just stroll into No 10\".\nThe PM claimed the Labour leader had no plan for how to run the country, at the Tories' local election campaign launch.\nMr Sunak said voters should look to councils like Birmingham's to see what Labour would do if they win power.\nSir Keir claims the PM is \"scared\" of calling an immediate general election because of his record in office.\nWith Labour far ahead in national opinion polls , many Conservatives are braced for a bad night on 2 May, when council elections are being held across England.\nMr Sunak, who has been dogged by speculation that rebel Tory MPs are plotting to replace him, sought to portray himself as an electoral underdog in a speech to Tory activists.\nSpeaking at a rally in Heanor, Derbyshire, he said Sir Keir was \"arrogantly taking the British people for granted\" and \"assuming that he can just stroll into Number 10 without saying what he would do\".\n\"We all know he can't tell you what he would do differently because he doesn't have a plan,\" said Mr Sunak, urging voters to \"send a message to Keir Starmer\".\nHe drew comparisons between councils run by Labour and Conservatives, claiming \"Whenever Labour run something they run it into the ground\".\nEight councils, run by both Labour and the Conservatives, have declared effective bankruptcy since 2018, with others warning they could be next as they struggle to make further cuts.\nLabour-run Birmingham City Council declared itself effectively bankrupt in September last year and has been forced to embark on an avalanche of cost-cutting measures, as well as raising council tax by 21% .\n\"In Birmingham, they've effectively bankrupted the biggest local authority in Europe,\" he said. \"They've saddled their constituents with a 21% council tax rise, that's not a typo: 21% council tax rise.\n\"What do you get for that? Hundreds of job losses, services slashed, streetlights being dimmed or switched off, making the streets less safe.\n\"They're not even going to collect the rubbish as much as they used to - and they're going to charge you, when the rats come, to take the rats away. That's what you get.\"\nHe also accused London mayor Sadiq Khan of \"being more interested in virtue signalling than delivering\" and wanting to \"tax motorists off the road\".\nOn 2 May, voters will go to the polls to choose councillors in more than 100 local authorities, as well as 11 mayors, 37 police and crime commissioners, and London Assembly members.\nThe Conservative launch comes after the Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey kicked off campaigning in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, earlier this week.\nMr Davey accused Rishi Sunak of \"squatting in Downing Street\" after \"bottling\" calling a May general election.\nLabour has not yet announced details of their local election campaign launch.",

But then \"he puts the ring on my hand and as I go to show him, the ring falls off my finger [and] plummets so fast, it was like a cinematic movie\".\n\"Jake threw himself so deep - the diver was like, 'You can't do that, your ears... literally your brain will explode,'\" she told host Jimmy Fallon.\nBut Bongiovi managed to rescue the ring, and once they got to the surface he properly proposed with a ring that belonged to Brown's mother.\nThe actress, 20, rose to fame as a child star on the smash hit Netflix series, with the forthcoming fifth season set to be the show's last.\nBongiovi, 21, one of rock star Bon Jovi's four children, recently landed his second major acting role in coming-of-age film Rockbottom.\nModine is also known for films including Full Metal Jacket and The Dark Knight Rises, and appeared in the Oscar-winning Oppenheimer.",

    "An IT worker who fatally poisoned a couple with the opioid painkiller fentanyl and rewrote their will has been jailed for a minimum of 37 years.\nStephen Baxter, 61, and his wife Carol, 64, were found dead at their home in West Mersea, Essex, in April 2023.\nLuke D'Wit, 34, used fake identities to manipulate the couple before he laced their medication with the drug, a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court heard.\nD'Wit, from West Mersea, will serve at least 37 years of a life sentence.\nDet Supt Rob Kirby, the head of major crime at Essex Police, said he had \"absolutely no doubt\" that D'Wit would have committed further murders had he not been caught.\nHe said the defendant was \"one of the most dangerous men\" he had seen during his policing career.\nThe trial heard D'Wit secretly laced the Baxters' medication with fentanyl and made sure they consumed it when he visited their house in Victory Road on 7 April 2023.\nMr and Mrs Baxter's daughter, Ellie, found her parents dead in their conservatory when she visited two days later on Easter Sunday.\nD'Wit arrived soon after and described himself as a \"friend\" to a 999 call handler, before calmly giving a false account as Miss Baxter was heard in distress in the background.\nReading her victim impact statement at Chelmsford Crown Court, Miss Baxter described D'Wit as a \"man so manipulative he hacked his way into our lives over a decade ago, schemed and thoroughly planned my parents' demise\".\nShe said her parents had \"looked after Luke\", adding: \"They just decided he was lonely, especially after Luke's dad died. They took him under their wing and would let him join in.\"\nDescribing the moment she found them dead, she said: \"I have never known an emotional pain to physically hurt so much.\n\"It was like my insides were on fire. I screamed and I screamed.\"\nThe defendant first met the Baxters between 2012 and 2013 after he was asked to build a website for their shower mat company, Cazsplash.\nThe court heard the day after they were found dead, D'Wit rewrote their will so he could seize control of the business.\nTracy Ayling KC, prosecuting, said the murders were the culmination of years of manipulation by D'Wit, mostly focused on Mrs Baxter but also - at times - her daughter.\nMrs Baxter had befriended D'Wit through the business and trusted him to help her manage her thyroid condition, Hashimoto's disease.\n'Desperate'\nThe jury was told D'Wit had 80 electronic devices and some of them had been used to create more than 20 false personas \"to manipulate\" Mrs Baxter.\nD'Wit posed as a doctor on one of the devices and offered her advice \"with no clinical basis\", while also pretending to be fellow Hashimoto's sufferers. the court heard.\nMiss Baxter, 22, told the trial: \"There was just this set of rules we had to follow.\n\"I think mum got a bit desperate and she got to a point where she would do anything to get better.\"\nHowever, Miss Baxter said her parents had become \"irritated\" that D'Wit was so frequently at their house in the months leading up to their deaths and they thought the computer science graduate was \"nerdy weird\".\nMs Ayling said D'Wit had photos on his phone of Mr and Mrs Baxter dead in their armchairs when it was seized by the police.\nThey were taken by the defendant who had installed a \"mobile security surveillance application\" on the device, she said.\nThis allowed him to monitor a camera from another device where, at some point between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, he was \"watching them die\", the prosecutor added.\nDuring the trial, D'Wit gave evidence from a wheelchair, which Ms Ayling alleged was an effort to attract sympathy from the jury.\nShe said following his arrest, a bag containing both opened and unopened fentanyl patches was found at D'Wit's home, which he shared with his mother.\n\"There can only be one purpose for having these and that's to fool someone into believing they were taking a proper dose when they were actually taking four times the amount,\" Ms Ayling added.\nMetal tacks, which police believe were the same ones found during a scan of Mrs Baxter's stomach when she was alive, were also discovered in the bag.\nToxicology reports later showed fentanyl was a factor in both deaths, with carbon monoxide poisoning quickly ruled out and no evidence to suggest either death had been caused by the couple themselves.\nDuring his defence, D'Wit claimed the fake personalities messaging Mrs Baxter were Stephen Baxter's idea.\nThe defendant said: \"The actual mechanics was me, but it was instructions from Stephen.\"\nD'Wit denied there was a \"sinister\" motive for the false identities, and said they were used by Mr Baxter to improve his wife's health and their relationship.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A British runner has made history by becoming the first woman to finish one of the world's hardest ultramarathons.\nJasmin Paris from Midlothian completed the Barkley Marathons in Tennessee with just one minute 39 seconds to spare of the 60-hour cut off.\nShe told the BBC she was \"overjoyed\" and had a \"strong feeling\" during training that she could complete it.\nShe was so exhausted she slumped to the ground after finishing the race which is inspired by a famous prison escape.\nThe course, at Frozen Head State Park, changes every year but covers 100 miles involving 60,000ft of climb and descent - about twice the height of  the Mount Everest.\nOnly 20 people have ever made it to the end of the race within the allotted 60 hours since it was extended to 100 miles in 1989.\nThe 40-year-old vet had to navigate through extreme and often pathless terrain, continuing to run through the night.\nPictures at the race finish line on Friday show her legs scratched from pushing through sharp bushes and scrub in dense forest on steep slopes.\nHaving lost her voice from heavy breathing during the race, Jasmin was unable to speak but told BBC Breakfast by text message she was \"overjoyed\" to have completed it.\nShe said: \"It still hasn't really sunk in that I've finally done it.\n\"This year I had a strong feeling in the months of training and run up to the race that I could do it.\n\"Those final moments have redefined for me what I am capable of.\"\nDavid Miller, a professional photographer at the race, told BBC Scotland he had witnessed the \"greatest ultramarathon achievement of all time\".\n\"There was a lot of anticipation at the finish line and three minutes before the 60 hour cut off we heard shouting and a roar and it was people cheering Jasmin on.\n\"She was sprinting and giving it her all as there was no room for error because otherwise she would not have made the cut off.\n\"She touched the gate and collapsed in exhaustion. It was the best thing I have ever seen, it was unbelievable.\n\"Obviously I was very focused on trying to capture Jasmin and a moment in history but at the same time I could feel a tear behind the lens because it was such an emotional moment.\"\nThe race is not only known for being physically gruelling but also for its odd traditions.\nThe course changes every year but is roughly five loops of 20 miles with only 35 participants allowed each year.\nThe Barkley course was created by Gary \"Lazarus Lake\" Cantrell and Karl Henn.\nThe idea for the race came when they read about the 1977 escape of James Earl Ray, the assassin of Martin Luther King Jr, from nearby Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary.\nWhen they discovered he had only managed to travel eight miles (13km) in 60 hours before he was caught the keen ultrarunners mocked the distance.\nMr Cantrell believed he could cover at least 100 miles in the time it took Ray to be found so he set about creating the race.\nThe Barkley is almost as tough to enter as it is to complete.\nThose who are able to acquire a little-known email address have to file an essay - \"Why I should be allowed to run in the Barkley\" - on the right minute of the right day to stand any chance of bagging a spot.\nThe race, in Tennessee, traditionally begins on the weekend nearest April Fools' Day with an entry fee of just $1.60 (\u00c2\u00a31.27), plus a licence plate for Barkley \"virgins\".\nThere is no official start time, with those who make it to Frozen Head State Park campground on the correct date notified one hour beforehand by the sound of a conch shell horn.\nThe race officially begins when the race director lights a cigarette.\nOn every lap, runners have to collect a page corresponding to their race number from the 14 books hidden around the unmarked course - which includes a tunnel at the now defunct prison.\nThey have no GPS, only a brief time to memorise the map and with limited notes on where to find them.\nThey take them to race creator and director Mr Cantrell, otherwise known as \"Laz\", at the end of each lap.\nHe waits at the yellow gate made iconic by the 2014 documentary Barkley Marathons: The Race That Eats Its Young.\nThe first and third loops are run clockwise, while the second and fourth loops are run anticlockwise. The first finisher of the fourth loop gets to decide which direction they go on the last loop.\nJasmin, who was born in Hadfield in Derbyshire, had previously completed what is called a \"Fun Run\" on her debut in 2022 by getting through three of the loops.\nDespite its title, the race is still 60-miles long. In 2006 nobody managed to finish it in under 40 hours.\nLast year Jasmin became the first female since 2001 to embark on a fourth loop.\nPreviously the best women's achievement was Sue Johnston's 66 miles (106 km) in 2001 when more than 30 competitors failed to reach the first book (two miles).\nIn January 2019 mother-of-two Jasmin expressed milk for her baby during a 268-mile race along the Pennine Way to break the course record by more than 12 hours.\nShe completed the Montane Spine Race - from De",

    "Next year, Lioness Bethany England is looking forward to walking down the aisle with her fianc\u00c3\u00a9e, Steph Williams.\nIt's not too long ago that a wedding between two women in the UK would have been impossible, but it all changed 10 years ago when same-sex marriage was legalised.\nBethany says 2014, when the new law came in, was about the time she realised she was gay.\nSince then women's football has seen an explosive rise in popularity, and the Tottenham striker is one of many gay female players.\nThe 29-year-old features in a BBC iPlayer documentary - Gay Marriage and Me - looking at how many more role models have spoken up since the law came in, and where marriage equality is at in 2024.\nBethany, who grew up in Barnsley, says she \"always wanted this big, fancy wedding\".\nBut for couples like her and Steph, it's still not possible to get married in most churches.\nWhen the law was introduced, religious organisations were automatically left out - and had to \"opt in\" to marry same-sex couples if they wanted to.\nIt also protects them from legal challenges if they don't.\nThe Church of England, along with many others, still defines marriage as between one man and one woman so its officials aren't allowed to legally marry gay couples unless that definition changes.\nThose institutions could decide to \"opt in\" to same-sex weddings under the law. The Church of England would also need that decision to go through parliament.\n\"As much as I'm not a religious person, I know there's plenty of people out there that are in the LGBTQ+ community,\" says Bethany.\n\"So I think to deny their wishes of what they want and having to wait even longer to find someone who's willing to do it takes away from their special moment and the love they have for each other.\"\nEven though it's not for her, Bethany says it's a \"shame there's still so much work to be done\" before more LGBT people can get married in ceremonies that reflect their faith.\nResearch by BBC Newsbeat found fewer than 3% of all religious buildings registered to marry people in England and Wales will officiate ceremonies for same-sex couples.\nSome priests within the Church of England, like Reverend Jide Macaulay, an openly gay priest from Manchester, would like things to change.\n\"I would love to be able to celebrate and offer same-sex marriages,\" he says.\n\"The Church has evolved from issues around slavery, racism, the subjugation of women.\n\"I am hoping that in five years to 10 years we will see a rollover in the Church of England where we can have those marriages in our church and to be able to say to people, 'God bless you'. That is all it takes.\"\nIn a statement, the Bishop of Leicester, Martyn Snow, who leads on these issues for the Church of England, said \"LGBTQ+ people are wholeheartedly welcome\" in the Church and it had recently approved new prayers of blessing for same-sex couples.\n\"A lot of people want the Church to take the next step and introduce same-sex marriage while others - in good conscience - see this as conflicting with Christian teaching,\" he said.\n\"The Church is trying to create an inclusive space where all voices are heard and respected. We're committed to engaging in these important discussions because these are matters which profoundly affect people's lives.\"\nIn Northern Ireland it is a similar situation. Of nearly 2,800 religious officiants, 65 are registered for same-sex weddings.\nThe Church of Scotland and Scottish Episcopal Church and The Quakers in Britain have opted in to the legislation.\nSo has the Methodist Church, which voted to allow same-sex marriages in 2021 .\nWatch Now on BBC iPlayer: Gay Marriage and Me - 10 years on from the UK's first gay weddings, how equal is equal marriage?\nBethany's had a mixture of positive and negative experiences since realising she was gay.\n\"We're in a world where things are changing but there's a long way to go for people being able to be accepted,\" she says.\nShe says she \"went through a period of being ashamed\" but her family were \"amazing\" when she told them.\nAnd despite the acceptance she feels on the pitch, Bethany says she and her partner still don't hold hands in the street.\n\"There's just people staring all the time,\" Bethany says. \"I'm like, are they staring at me? Her? Us together?\n\"Steph doesn't want to make people uncomfortable,\" she says. \"It's sad she has to think what others think.\"\nAnd Bethany's increased profile as part of the England squad that won the 2022 Euros and made it to the 2023 Women's World Cup final has also brought more online hate.\nShe says it's mostly \"generic\" and misogynist \"get in the kitchen\" type comments.\nBut some are homophobic too, particularly when posts include her partner, and she says many can have a religious element.\n\"Guys saying, 'Come to my side, I'll show you a good time,' or 'You don't know what you're doing with a woman' and 'It's against God's will',\" she says.\n\"But obviously I'm very happy in who I am and who I'm with and I've no shame in that any more.\"\nAdditional re",

    "India's main opposition Congress party has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government of using the tax department to starve them of finances ahead of elections starting next month.\nCongress leader Sonia Gandhi said they had made \"a systematic effort to cripple the party financially\".\nThe party said freezing its accounts, which have 2.1bn rupees ($25m; \u00c2\u00a320m), was \"unprecedented and undemocratic\".\nThe BJP is yet to respond to the allegations.\nCongress made the accusations on Thursday at a press conference attended by party chief Mallikarjun Kharge, top leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi and treasurer Ajay Maken.\nIndia's general election will take place in seven phases over April and May. Opinion polls predict a win for Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies, which is eyeing a record consecutive third term in power.\nLast month, the Congress said its bank accounts had been frozen by the income tax (IT) department.\nOn Thursday, Mr Maken said 11 party accounts were frozen and the 2.1bn rupees in them was put under lien - which means that they cannot be withdrawn or transferred.\n\"This is not the freezing of the India National Congress' bank accounts,\" Mr Gandhi said. \"This is the freezing of Indian democracy.\"\nMr Maken said the \"unprecedented action\" was because the tax authorities were owed 1.4m rupees.\n\"All political parties are exempt from income tax. Then why is only the Congress being penalised?\" he asked.\nIn a statement to the BBC, the income tax department declined to disclose details regarding the Congress party's bank account. It, however, said the decision to impose lien had been upheld by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the Delhi High Court.\nMrs Gandhi said the party was unable to access the funds it had collected from the public and its workers. \"Money from our accounts is being taken away forcibly,\" she said.\nThese actions were affecting the level-playing field necessary to hold the 2024 general elections, Mr Kharge said, adding that it amounted to destroying democracy in India.\n\"We are unable to spend money on our election campaign, on advertisements and publicity, and to pay our party workers and to print campaign materials,\" he said.\n\"There are institutions in the country that are supposed to protect the democratic framework,\" Mr Gandhi said. \"However, no court is saying anything. The Election Commission is silent, no other institution is speaking out, and the media is not addressing the issue.\"\nCongress party leaders also pointed out that their party was being crippled financially at a time when it had just been revealed that the BJP had benefited \"hugely\" from the now-illegal electoral bonds scheme.\nMr Modi's government launched electoral bonds in 2018 saying it would make political funding more transparent. But the scheme allowed people and companies to donate money to parties anonymously.\nLast month, India's Supreme Court banned the scheme, calling it \"unconstitutional\", and ordered the Election Commission to disclose donation details to the public.\nThis data showed that the ruling BJP was the biggest beneficiary of the scheme, securing almost half of the bonds worth 120bn rupees donated between 2018 and 2024.\nRead more India stories from the BBC:",

The fact that she is a newcomer to politics was seen as an asset by the coalition, which argued that this made it harder for her opponents to discredit her.\nBut when it came to registering her candidacy by the deadline set for Monday evening, however, the opposition coalition hit a wall.\nIn videos uploaded to social media, the PUD showed how they repeatedly tried and failed to log into the electoral council website to register Ms Yoris's candidacy.\nOne of the parties which forms part of the coalition, however, was granted an extension and was able to log into the system to register Mr Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez.\nA variety of other parties were also able to file candidates bringing the total number of presidential candidates to 13, but some of them are aligned to the government and are not thought to be serious challengers to President Maduro.\nThe PUD said in a statement that the candidacy of Mr Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez was \"provisional... given the clear impossibility of registering the chosen candidate so far\", suggesting the former diplomat was chosen as a placeholder.\nParties can make changes to their presidential ticket until 20 April and the opposition coalition is expected to replace him with a unity candidate.\nAnother politician who was successful in registering, Manuel Rosales, has already announced that he would be willing to give up his place on the ballot in favour of a unity candidate.",

    "Protests within 150 metres of schools should be banned, a senior government adviser has recommended.\nThe call comes after a review examined protests including at Batley Grammar School in West Yorkshire in 2021.\nThey occurred after pupils were shown a cartoon of the prophet Mohammed during a lesson, and led to the teacher's suspension.\nA wider issue of eroding social cohesion is cause for concern, adviser Dame Sara Khan said.\nDame Sara, who led the review, told BBC Breakfast that the former Batley teacher remains in hiding to this day despite being cleared of ill intent, and has never been legally recognised as a victim of harassment.\nHe was the victim of what she has termed \"freedom-restricting harassment\", she said.\n\"The idea that people should be able to create that kind of environment outside of schools\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 is just unacceptable,\" she said.\nThere were two days of protests outside the school gates, with demonstrators demanding the sacking of the teacher in question - and accusing staff of failing to take the issue seriously..\nOn the second day - the last before Easter holidays that year - the school switched to remote learning.\nThe teacher in question told the review he felt let down by West Yorkshire Police.\nIn response, the police said it was aware of the concerns in the report, that it took threatening behaviour seriously and measures were put in place to manage the incident and the repercussions which resulted from it.\nThe review, commissioned by the UK government, is recommending a 150-metre (165 yards) exclusion zone be set up outside of schools in England, within which most forms of protests would be banned.\nDame Sara \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a human rights campaigner who advises the government on social cohesion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 said a narrow range of protests would be allowed within the zone, such as teachers who are picketing as part of industrial action. However, any intimidatory demonstrations would be excluded.\nUnder current laws, protests in a fixed place such as at school gates are legal providing they do not trespass or damage private property, nor obstruct anyone unless police have given permission.\nProtesters also have a legal obligation to respond to police if officers allege a public order offence is being committed.\nDame Sara said the proposed exclusion zones would be enshrined in law and policed in a similar way to abortion clinics.\nLast year, Parliament voted through changes to the Public Order Act that set up \"safe access zones\" outside abortion clinics or hospitals providing abortion services. These are also 150-metre zones in which protests cannot be held.\nThe review has also recommended a new independent office for social cohesion be set up to advise the government on community relations.\nThere is an assumption that politicians and people in the public eye are the only ones who experience freedom-restricting harassment, Dame Sara said, but her review found that this wasn't the case.\nThe review polled more than 1,000 people around the UK and found that 76% felt they had restricted expressing their personal views in public, out of fear of harassment either to themselves or their loved ones.\nDame Sara told the BBC there there was no specific government strategy to manage social cohesion. - and said that a new ministerial office should be set up to provide guidance in this area.\n\"I worry that if we don't do that, we will see a gradual erosion of social cohesion,\" she said.",

    "The man tasked with championing an increase in university students from Scotland's most deprived areas says \"things really have to change\".\nProf John McKendrick was appointed as Scotland's commissioner on fair access to higher education a year ago.\nHe said the Scottish government was not on track to meet its targets for widening access.\nAnd he fears college funding cuts could deny some students the \"spingboard\" they need to get to university.\nThe government said \"clear progress\" had been made in recent years towards meeting its targets.\nIt wants students from the 20% most deprived areas to represent 20% of entrants to higher education by 2030.\nEducation Secretary Jenny Gilruth has recommitted to an interim target of 18% by 2026.\nHowever, a recent report said progress had \"stalled\" at about 16.5%.\nProf McKendrick, of Glasgow Caledonian University, said he was worried that cuts to college funding could further hinder progress.\nColleges are facing cuts of 4.7% in 2024/25, a real terms reduction of 8%, claims Colleges Scotland.\nThis comes after an 8.5% real-terms cut from 2021 to 2023, according to spending watchdog Audit Scotland.\n'Realise their potential'\nProf McKendrick acknowledged the effort the government had made to maintain the numbers of students from the most deprived areas entering university over the past three years.\nHe said colleges were important to the fair access agenda, allowing people to realise their potential or have a gateway to a university.\nAnd he expressed concerns that colleges had already announced cuts to the number of places available in the 2024/25 academic year.\n\"There is a risk of courses being withdrawn, and there is obviously some courses that have already been withdrawn, notice has been given of that, so there's less range of opportunity for young people in the area,\" he said.\n\"I think we all understand the importance of a college education.\n\"It provides opportunities to young people and adults, returning adults as well, that might not otherwise have the opportunity to realise their potential.\"\nAt Dumfries and Galloway college, which trains and educates 7,000 students per year, the principal has described the upcoming cuts as \"devastating\" to the local economy and students from deprived areas.\nPrincipal Joanna Campbell said: \"For those students who wish to progress on to either higher education and can't get there, or need to train in a skill that allows them to go out and seek employment, we cannot provide the same volume of opportunities.\n\"And that is absolutely devastating for not just this regional economy, but actually, every college in Scotland will be facing the same dilemma.\"\nAs rural areas struggle to hold onto the younger generation, who tend to migrate to the central belt to study and often don't return to their home town, building enough affordable homes and providing local jobs are key targets to retaining young talent.\nMs Campbell and her staff were trying to meet the need for more skilled tradesmen in the area, while dealing with budgetary restraints.\nShe said: \"We've really majored in a number of areas that are particularly significant to our regional economy to allow it to grow.\n\"We're seeing, particularly in construction and engineering, over-demand for those subject areas.\n\"And of course, if our budget remains the same, or is reduced, then it means that we are not going to be able to provide skills in those sectors, which are hugely important to our regional economy.\"\nWhen Dumfries and Galloway opened its application for the upcoming academic year, the construction course was quickly over-prescribed.\nThe college will now need to reduce the number of students it accepts to meet a \u00c2\u00a31m cut to its budget come April.\nMitchell Hammond, 19, has completed three years of his four-year bricklaying apprenticeship while attending the college for a fortnight every month.\nIf he could not attend a course locally, he would have to make a two-hour journey to Ayr.\nHe said the course was \"very important\" to his future, adding: \"It'll set me up for life.\"\nA spokesperson for the Scottish government said: \"Clear progress has been made in recent years towards the target of 20% of students entering higher education from Scotland's most deprived backgrounds by 2030.\n\"While this is the most challenging budget to be delivered under devolution, the 24/25 budget still allocated nearly \u00c2\u00a32bn to universities and colleges - supporting their delivery of high quality education, training and research.\"",

    "A former soldier turned government minister said more should be done for veterans , after hearing of an ex-comrade's struggle.\nVeterans' Affairs Minister Johnny Mercer spoke after hearing how Paul Barnsley, 53, of Colchester, considered suicide after leaving the army.\nMr Mercer said he joined the government to ease the transition for veterans returning to civilian life.\nHe described his former comrade's struggle as \"heart-breaking\".\n\"It is really hard to leave the military and go back into civilian life,\" he told BBC Essex.\nMr Mercer, Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, said: \"I became an MP because I was sick of the way this government and country treated veterans. They talked a really good game but actually, for my generation of veterans from Afghanistan, it felt pretty poor.\"\nHe said the government was now spending about \u00c2\u00a36bn a year on pensions, housing and employment schemes for veterans.\n\"We can do better in improving the perception of veterans, which is still that they are mad, bad and dangerous, which is total rubbish,\" he said.\nMr Barnsley served in the army alongside Mr Mercer in the early 2000s.\nBut he said leaving the army almost felt like he had an arm removed.\n\"It was tough - there were times I wanted to end it all,\" he said.\nBut now he has been appointed as an apprentice carpenter in Manningtree, Essex.\nMr Mercer said the government had not always got it right but said support for people who had left the forces had \"never been better\", although there was still room for improvement.\nUrging businesses to employ veterans, he added: \"These are the best people you can have in your company, it's the best business decision you can make.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "China has announced it will remove significant tariffs on Australian wine in another key sign of improving relations between the two countries.\nBeijing imposed taxes of more than 200% in 2020 amid a string of economic blows to Australian exports.\nThat year Beijing targeted Australian coal, barley, timber and lobsters as part of a wider political falling-out.\nBut China-Australia relations have improved since a new Canberra government was elected in 2022.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese welcomed the announcement from the Chinese commerce ministry on Thursday, saying his government had also managed to reduce other trade barriers.\nLast August, China removed the tariffs it had imposed on Australian barley - another key commodity that had been targeted.\n\"This outcome affirms the calm and consistent approach taken by the Albanese Labor Government and follows the success of the similar approach taken to remove duties on Australian barley,\" Prime Minister Albanese said in a statement.\nHe said his government was still lobbying China on removing remaining tariffs on commodities such as beef and lobster.\nChina had previously been the most lucrative market for Australian winemakers- accounting for nearly a third of all bottles shipped overseas.\nAustralian wine representatives said the industry lost A$2.1bn ($1.37bn, \u00c2\u00a31.08bn) in the year after China was shut off. Despite pivoting to other markets, winemakers struggled to sell the volume of bottles to other countries and have faced a significant glut in recent years.\nChina's Commerce Ministry on Thursday said it was removing the duties on bottled wine due to \"changes in the market situation of the relevant wines in China\". The penalty would be removed from Friday.\nBeijing had always denied accusations of economic coercion, instead previously justifying its duties on Australian wine as being anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures.\nThat had led to Australia filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the validity of such penalties. The case was withdrawn last year as the two nations' relations improved, and Canberra confirmed this again on Thursday.\nThe prospect of the tariff's scrapping had earlier in February been forecast in Australia by government ministers following diplomatic discussions.\nAnd earlier this month, the Chinese commerce ministry published an interim decision indicating the tariffs would most likely be removed.\nLast week, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi also went to Canberra to hold meetings with Australian leaders.\nChina remains Australia's number one trade partner and export destination for several commodities.\nIn late 2020, Beijing imposed a series of tariffs and other economic burdens on more than a dozen Australian goods and commodities - citing trade or production issues.\nHowever Canberra saw it as a retaliatory campaign of economic coercion for political steps the Australia government had taken: including being the first Western country to bar Chinese tech firm Huawei from bidding for the country's 5G tender and demanding an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19.\nDespite the hits to certain industries- estimated to be worth about A$20bn - the value of the China-Australia trade relationship has remained at a consistent level and trade has increased 12%.\nThe majority of the value in the A$317bn trading relationship comes from China's reliance on Australian raw materials such as iron ore.",
    "The Palestine Red Crescent Society says al-Amal hospital in southern Gaza is out of service after Israeli troops forced medics and patients to evacuate.\nOn Monday, 27 staff, six patients, another person and the bodies of two people recently shot and killed were moved from the facility in Khan Younis.\nThey were trapped in ambulances for 20 hours, according to the PRCS.\nIsrael's military says its intelligence indicates that \"terrorists are using civilian infrastructure\" in the area.\nIsraeli troops reportedly surrounded both al-Amal and the nearby Nasser hospital over the weekend, amid intense hostilities in the west of Khan Younis.\nMeanwhile, fighting is continuing around al-Shifa hospital, in northern Gaza, where the military says it has killed 175 \"terrorists\" and detained about 500 suspects linked to Hamas or Islamic Jihad in a raid that began eight days ago.\nThe military says hospitals have been used by Hamas as bases and has released videos and photos to support its claim. Hamas denies the accusation.\nThe PRCS, which runs al-Amal hospital, said in a statement on Sunday that Israeli troops had been firing smoke bombs around the facility to try to force staff, patients and displaced people to leave, while bulldozing surrounding streets and erecting barriers.\nIt also said a staff member named Amir Abu Aisha had been killed by Israeli gunfire, and that a displaced person had been wounded in the head. The second man later died of his wounds.\nIn the afternoon, the medical organisation announced that all displaced people and patients who could move independently had been evacuated and were heading towards the al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis.\n\"We woke up at 02:30 [on Sunday]. There was constant gunfire within the surroundings of the hospital. Our co-worker Amir was martyred while he was at the human resources [office]. He was hit in the chest by a bullet and died immediately,\" Samy al-Omry, one of the paramedics at al-Amal, told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline radio service while he walked to al-Mawasi on Monday.\n\"After that, we were surprised by [Israeli vehicles] entering the hospital, seizing it and closing the gates with mountains of sand. Drones with loudspeakers kept saying: 'Evacuate the hospital now',\" he added.\n\"Every time we tried to leave [Israeli forces] would fire on us, until they sent a message with a child who had gone out earlier, telling us to go out where they had made a pathway.\"\nOn Monday, the PRCS reported that the remaining staff and wounded had spent 20 hours trapped inside ambulances after being forcibly evacuated overnight .\n\"While attempting to leave through the military checkpoint, the teams encountered difficulty moving due to extensive excavation and infrastructure destruction,\" it said.\n\"During the attempt to clear the rubble and obstacles on the road, the [Israeli] forces opened fire towards two of the teams trying to remove the rubble, directly injuring them.\n\"Efforts were made to evacuate them, and the teams managed to rescue one of them, while they were unable to deal with the second case due to uncertainty about his fate.\"\nLater, the ambulances were forced by Israeli troops to return to al-Amal, \"where they found the hospital gate closed, making it impossible for the teams to re-enter\", it added.\nThe UN said the PRCS staff and wounded patients had reportedly arrived in the southern town of Rafah on Monday afternoon.\nOn Monday night, the PRCS expressed its \"profound regret for the closure of al-Amal hospital\", saying it came after \"the international community failed to provide the necessary protection for its teams, patients, and [displaced people]\".\n\"The hospital was besieged for over 40 days and was repeatedly bombed before the occupation forces reinstated the siege and forced everyone inside to leave,\" it added.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Tuesday morning that its troops were \"eliminating terrorists and carrying out targeted raids on terrorist infrastructure\" in the al-Amal area, where the hospital is located, and in nearby al-Qarara.\n\"During the activity, the troops located explosive devices, grenades, weapons, vests, and a large amount of ammunition,\" it added.\nOn Monday, the IDF said more than 20 fighters had been killed there in close-quarters combat and air strikes.\nWhen asked about the reports of the hospital's evacuation on Monday, the IDF said it called on Hamas to \"cease using hospitals and additional civilian infrastructure as shields for their terrorist activities which harm innocent civilians\".\n\"The IDF will continue to operate in accordance with international law and take measures to uphold the safety and well-being of civilians.\"\nIsraeli forces raided al-Amal hospital in February. The IDF said about 20 suspects, including Hamas members, were detained before they withdrew.\nThe situation was unclear at the nearby Nasser hospital, which was also raided last month.

    "US President Joe Biden hosted a record-breaking election fundraiser in New York City, alongside his predecessors Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\nHis team said the star-studded evening at Radio City Music Hall would raise over $25m (\u00c2\u00a320m) for the campaign - a record for a single political event.\nThey are looking to extend a growing cash gap between the president and his Republican challenger Donald Trump.\nPolls suggest the race for the White House rests on a knife edge.\nSome of those in attendance, such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, were sure to make those election stakes clear to the raucous crowd of 5,000 Democrats. The New York senator told them they must do whatever they could to ensure that the \"dishonest, chaotic, ineffective regime of Donald Trump\" did not return.\nComedian Mindy Kaling hosted the event and spoke just moments after singer Lizzo finished a rendition of her hit About Damn Time. Other stars such as Queen Latifah and Cynthia Erivo also took the stage.\nBut the longest standing ovation was saved for the moment when the three presidents - Mr Biden, Mr Obama and Mr Clinton - came out.\nChants of \"four more years\" echoed throughout the auditorium for Mr Biden.\n\"Three presidents... and none of them are here to go to court,\" joked comedian Stephen Colbert, alluding to Mr Trump's legal troubles.\nThe late-night comedy host then moderated a conversation between the three presidents.\nMr Biden began with an oft-repeated slogan, saying democracy was at stake in this election. He said Mr Trump had a \"perverse view of the world\", noting his opponent's vocal support of those who participated in the 6 January Capitol Riot and his buoying of authoritarian leaders abroad.\n\"But I'm really hopeful,\"  the president added. \"If we get by this election, we can set the course for the next four, five, six decades.\"\nMr Obama, for his part, touted Biden's legislative victories. He said the president had done everything from reducing the cost of medicine to creating jobs - particularly for African Americans.\nHe added that Mr Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and his supporters seemed \"increasingly unconcerned with the essence of America\", which he said was centred on the idea of \"bridging our differences and moving forward\".\nMr Clinton, meanwhile, accused Mr Trump of \"stealing a few good years\" from the back of Mr Obama's administration and somehow claiming \"overnight\" successes.\nThe four men ended their time on stage by putting on aviator sunglasses in an impression of Mr Biden, which earned a standing ovation.\nFirst Lady Jill Biden was due to host a private after-party for 500 guests. The president's son, Hunter Biden, and his family were to attend.\nThe tickets were priced between $225 and half-a-million dollars. For $100,000, guests could get a picture with Mr Biden, Mr Obama and Mr Clinton, with star photographer Annie Leibovitz taking the snaps.\nWhile the three presidents were on the same page during their time on stage, the event did not pass without incident.\nProtesters who condemn Israel for its invasion of the Gaza Strip gathered outside Radio City Music Hall to call for a ceasefire. Some were able to interrupt the event inside the theatre as well.\nMr Biden quickly took up the issue over the shouts of the protesters and to the applause of the crowd.\n\"There has to be a two-state solution, a progression,\" he said. \"But I'm confident that can be done with Israel's integrity... preserved.\"\nMr Biden's two predecessors backed him, with Mr Obama chiding the protesters by saying that they \"can't just talk and not listen - that's what the other side does\".\nThe Israel-Gaza war is one of the issues that has been dragging down Mr Biden's approval rating. Voters are also unhappy about the economy, inflation and immigration.\nFacing lagging approval ratings, the 81-year-old has worked to capitalise on momentum following his well-received State of the Union Address earlier this month.\nThursday's event comes after a Biden campaign blitz in battleground states and could prove pivotal in November's vote.\nThere are clear financial results.

    "The EU has announced investigations into some of the biggest tech firms in the world over uncompetitive practices.\nMeta, Apple, and Alphabet, which owns Google, are being looked into for potential breaches of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) introduced in 2022.\nIf they are found to have broken the rules, the firms can face huge fines of up to 10% of their annual turnover.\nEU antitrust boss Margrethe Vestager and industry head Thierry Breton announced the investigations on Monday.\nJust six companies have obligations under the DMA, but they are also the world's largest tech firms: Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and ByteDance.\nNone of the firms are actually based in Europe - five of them are in the US, while ByteDance has headquarters in Beijing.\nThree of them are now facing questions just two weeks after submitting their compliance reports, which will have been meticulously compiled.\nIt comes three weeks after the EU fined Apple \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.8bn (\u00c2\u00a31.5bn) for breaking competition laws over music streaming.\nMeanwhile, the United States accused Apple of monopolising the smartphone market in a landmark lawsuit against the tech giant introduced last week .\nAn Apple spokesperson says the company will constructively engage with the investigation and that they're confident that their plan complies with the Digital Markets Act.\nThey added that their teams established a variety of mechanisms to comply with the EU's landmark legislation, as well as privacy and security protections for EU users.\n\"Throughout, we've demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness to the European Commission and developers, listening and incorporating their feedback,\" they said.\nMeanwhile a Meta spokesperson said the firm's use of subscriptions as an alternative to advertising were \"a well-established business model across many industries\".\n\"We designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA... we will continue to engage constructively with the Commission,\" they said.\nAlphabet has been approached for comment.\nFive investigations\nThe EU said it will investigate five different possible acts of non-compliance in its announcement:\nThe first two of these investigations concern what is known as \"anti-steering\" - and the EU says it believes the firms are making it difficult for apps to tell users about ways to pay less for their services outside of using app stores' own payment methods.\nUnder the third point, the EU says that Apple is obliged to allow users to easily uninstall apps on their devices, change default settings and be given \"choice screens\" to let them use different browsers or search engines.\nThe EU says Apple's web browser \"choice screen\" does not give people enough choice, and said that some apps, such as Apple Photos, cannot be deleted at all.\nAccording to Ms Vestager, the investigation will take around 12 months to complete - though Mr Breton later clarified it could take slightly longer.\n\"We suspect that the suggested solutions put forward by the three companies do not fully comply with the DMA,\" she said.\n\"We will now investigate the companies' compliance with the DMA, to ensure open and contestable digital markets in Europe.\"\nThe five cases are consumer-focused, and highly relatable to most people who use products from these companies, which is collectively billions of people worldwide.\n\"We're talking about the protection of our citizens, we can't just sit around and wait,\" said Thierry Breton, of the EU's decision to act straight away.\nThere is however another reason potentially in mind: European Parliament elections are due to be held in June 2024.\nDr Rupprecht Podszun, director of the Institute for Competition Law at Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf, called it \"a strong signal\" from the EU.\n\"The DMA is designed for quick results,\" he said.\n\"The cases that the Commission has selected go to the heart of the business models; these are not marginal issues for the gatekeepers.\n\"The legal battles will be tense, but we must always bear in mind that the Court of Justice will have the last word.\"",
    "A drunk footballer has been jailed for four years after causing the death of a father in a crash in Inverclyde.\nCraig Forbes, 23, struck David Horn's vehicle on the A78 on 15 October 2022.\nThe Largs Thistle player was more than twice the alcohol limit when he overtook another vehicle when it was unsafe, moments before the collision.\nBoth vehicles rotated after the point of impact, with the 59-year-old victim becoming trapped inside. He later died in hospital from his injuries.\nForbes was also disqualified from driving for seven years and he must sit the extended test at the end of the ban.\nThe junior footballer pled guilty at the High Court in Glasgow to causing Mr Horn's death by dangerous driving.\nThe court heard how Mr Horn was driving home in his Toyota Yaris, having dropped his daughter off in Greenock at 23:20.\nForbes had attended a wedding and was returning to Greenock in his Volkswagen Golf.\nShortly before the collision, Forbes overtook a car when it was unsafe to do so and collided with Mr Horn's vehicle.\nA collision investigation determined that \"it occurred as a result of Forbes, while impaired by alcohol, losing directional control of his car for an unknown reason.\n\"This caused the car to enter the southbound lane and strike the front of Mr Horn's car.\n\"Mr Horn had insufficient time to take evasive action. Forbes was solely to blame for the collision which caused Mr Horn's death.\"\nMr Horn was initially found trapped in his car by medics before he was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.\nHe went into full cardiac arrest during the journey and CPR was carried out. But his condition did not improve and he died in hospital later that night .\nJudge Douglas Brown said he he had to consider the injuries Forbes himself suffered, his early guilty plea and the young person's sentencing guidelines for offenders under 25.\nThe judge said he had read the victim impact statements from Mr Horn's wife of 24 years Jaqueline and his two children and concluded that the effect of Mr Horn's death was \"devastating\".\nHe said: \"These statements in eloquent moving terms describe the impact his death had upon them.\n\"It is clear from what they say that he was a loving and hugely supportive husband and father.\n\"This has changed their lives forever and they have difficulty contemplating a future without him.\n\"Nothing the court can impose can realistically bring any significant comfort to them.\"\n'Selfish decision'\nIn a statement after the sentencing, Mr Horn's wife Jacqueline said the family's lives had \"changed forever.\"\nShe said: \"This is due to a selfish decision made by Craig Forbes.\n\"This choice resulted in not only the death of my husband, but a father, son and friend of many.\n\"Now we have to live the rest of our lives without David and Craig Forbes will now be known as a killer.\n\"Although he has been sentenced today, we have been given a life sentence because of his actions that night, of which we will never forgive him.\"\nMr Horn, from Wemyss Bay, was described as \"loving, caring and compassionate husband and father, and a ready, willing and true friend to many.\"\nForbes' football team Largs Thistle said they \"believe in positive rehabilitation\" and \"support Craig in his ongoing progress as he learns to deal with the devastation he has caused\".\nSimon Gilbride, defending, said his client had paid for an Airbnb room near the wedding venue but \"impulsively\" left the wedding to drive home, which he would \"regret for the rest of his life\".\nHe said the consequences of his actions were \"incredibly tragic\".\nHe told the court: \"One can imagine what his family have experienced and the loss that they must feel.\n\"At the wedding when drinking there was no intention at that point to go outside and drive that night.\n\"There was no consideration as to how much he was drinking at that point.\"",

    "It was an innocent trip to the petrol station for an aunt and her niece that saw them both jailed over three deaths.\nAfter a fire killed a mother and her children, Annette Hewins, 31, and Donna Clarke, 27, were wrongly blamed.\nAnnette, from Merthyr Tydfil, had her baby taken away from her when she was jailed, and turned to heroin to cope.\nSpeaking on BBC Wales' Wrongly Accused: The Annette Hewins Story podcast, her daughter Nicole Jacob, 31, said it \"ripped our family apart\".\n\"Now as an adult, I want answers,\" she said.\nAnnette Hewins was jailed in 1997 after being convicted of arson with intent to endanger life at Cardiff Crown Court.\nIt was following a fire that caused the deaths of Diane Jones and her two daughters on Merthyr Tydfil's Gurnos estate in 1995.\nHer conviction was quashed in 1999 after she had served two and a half years of a 13-year sentence.\nShe died in February 2017, less than 24 hours after being detained in a mental health unit , after struggling to cope with the miscarriage of justice.\nWhat happened on the night of the fire?\n\"A trip to the garage would alter the course of our lives,\" said Nicole, describing the night of the fire.\n\"When my mum and Donna arrived at the petrol station, Donna went into the shop to buy electricity tokens - mum filled the car with petrol.\n\"Then my mum dropped off Donna at the Gurnos and returned home to us.\n\"But back at the Gurnos the night was just getting started.\"\nDenise Sullivan then met Donna to go to a party.\nMs Sullivan, now 52, had been released on remand for shoplifting, and Donna was excited to have her best friend back.\nShe said there was a party culture in the community and that night they used drugs \"acid and mushrooms\", while Donna also took amphetamines.\n\"She was really in high spirits,\" Ms Sullivan said.\n\"Nothing untoward, just glad to be out and back together.\"\nHowever, the night took a shocking turn when they noticed the sky outside was full of smoke.\nThe party-goers rushed to the blazing house, and realised it was their friend Diane's - who had a two-year-old, Shauna, and 13-month-old daughter, Sarah-Jane.\nHow did the community react?\nTheir deaths in the blaze hit the community hard and hundreds of people lined the streets for the funeral.\nShaun Hibberd, the children's dad, was in prison and released to lay his children and partner to rest.\nOriginally, the community believed the fire was caused by an electrical accident - but the police soon launched a triple murder investigation after petrol was found on the inside carpet of Diane's house.\nPolice found a washing-up liquid bottle and coke can near the house which contained petrol - a finger print was discovered, but after fingerprinting 700 families it was found to be an innocent eight-year-old boy.\nAt the time, it was reported 3,500 people were interviewed and 400 calls were made to the incident room in relation to the case - but police still believed someone was shielding the killer.\nWhat did witnesses see?\n\"More than one witness recalled seeing three men at Shaun and Diane's house that evening,\" Nicole said.\nOne statement to police described them getting into a car at the front of the house and driving away, another person said they had seen these men at the house before.\nNicole added: \"Did they ever find that car? Did they know whose car it was, was it ruled out as being linked to the fire - what conclusion did they draw?\"\nWhat were the possible motives?\nMs Sullivan said Shaun Hibberd was \"one of the main suppliers\" of drugs on the estate and a lot of people did not like him and were jealous of how well he was doing from dealing.\nShe said there were times he was beaten up with hammers by rivals.\nBut it was not drugs that led police to Annette.\nA senior officer appealed for \"rumours\" or \"innuendos\" which may lead them to the killer - which was when somebody alleged an affair between Donna and Shaun.\nMs Sullivan said it was true but the affair had ended months before.\nDonna and Diane had arguments about the affair, she said, \"but that didn't mean Donna killed her\".\nPolice arrested Donna and Ms Sullivan as suspects, then two days later they brought Annette into the station after hearing she took her niece to the garage that night.\nThe police believed Annette and Donna had siphoned petrol from the car and used it to start the fire.\nShe was released without charge, but four months later, Annette received a phone call from Donna's solicitor saying the police were going to charge her.\nBob Woffinden, a freelance journalist who covered the case, said: \"The police will get a little bit of a snippet of information or a particular innuendo and will then hare off down the wrong road.\n\"We do know there were lots of other grade one suspects involved in this case and there were lots of other avenues I think that were much more persuasive - and the police should have been directing their enquiries along totally different avenues right from the beginning.\"\nWho was Annette Hewins?\nAnnette had grown up on ",
    "France has moved a step closer to banning discrimination in the workplace against hairstyles.\nA bill has been approved in the National Assembly and will now be debated in the Senate.\nThe law will bar employers from requiring hair to be straightened and for afros, dreadlocks and braids to be covered.\nIts author hopes the law will support those, particularly black people, who have faced workplace hostility.\nThe bill does not specifically target race-based discrimination, though that is the law's primary motivation.\nIt will also protect blondes and redheads, as well as bald victims of what it calls \"hair prejudice\".\nIt was proposed by Olivier Serva, an MP from the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, who presented an American study which pointed out that a quarter of black women said they had been ruled out for jobs because of how they wore their hair at the interview.\n\"People who don't fit in Eurocentric standards are facing discrimination, stereotypes and bias,\" Mr Serva said.\nCritics of the bill say existing French law already bans the compilation of personal data about an individual's race or ethnic background on the basis of the French Republic's \" universalist \" principles.\nBut anti-racism campaigners say the fact that the bill does not include the term \"racism\" is problematic, given many including public figures have faced negative comments online because of the way their natural hair looked.\nThey say that the main targets of hair discrimination are black people.\nDaphne Bedinade, a social anthropologist, told Le Monde newspaper: \"To make this only about hair discrimination is to mask the problems of people whose hair makes them a target of discrimination, mostly black women.\"\nA journalist from Guadeloupe, Guylaine Conquet, who worked for French television in the Caribbean island, said she had always been told by people that to look professional, she had to wear straightened hair.\nShe told Radio France International: \"In 2015 I decided to go back to natural, which was very hard for me. Because I wasn't used to my natural hair, which is weird.\"\nMs Conquet said that her audience was also not used to her natural hair, adding, \"they were looking at me, they were sending me messages - you know, it's not attractive, why am I doing that... So there was a lot of pressure\".\nIn 2022, a black Air France crew member, Aboubakar Traor\u00c3\u00a9, won a 10-year legal battle for the right to work with braided hair on flights after a decision by France's highest appeals court.\nThe court however ruled on the basis of gender, given his female counterparts were allowed to wear braids.",
    "Click! That sound you hear is the core pieces of the election snapping into place. After this week, the questions our two big parties will separately pose are clear.\nI'm not sure that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has much in common with a Hollywood star turned US presidential hopeful who, in the final week of the 1980 campaign, stared into the camera and said: \"Ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?\" But the question Labour will now pose is very similar. It worked for Ronald Reagan - what will it do for Starmer?\nSeparately, you might have thought Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's claim of a \"new economic moment\" sounded like the name of an obscure indie band. But with inflation slowing , and hopes of an interest rate cut soon , the Tories are warming up to asking: \"Are you better off than you were a few months ago?\"\nAs the BBC's Faisal Islam has explained , statements from the PM, the Governor of the Bank of England and the shadow chancellor have created chatter about \"green shoots of recovery\". But will the public really feel it? Will voters be grateful to the government if they do feel more flush? And if the economy really is getting better, could that save the Tories from calamity?\nAre voters really feeling it?\nPrices are rising more slowly, as the government is eager to remind you. Pay packets have been growing, and the National Minimum Wage is going up again next week. A member of the government has suggested the cost of living crisis has ended - and there are signs that the economy is turning (or at least, that it's stopped getting worse).\nBut given what's happened in recent years - including the war in Ukraine and Liz Truss' market meltdown - most voters aren't suddenly going to feel like they have cash to spare.\nOne former minister tells me: \"I don't think people will feel materially better off by September and October\" - when it's likely the election will take place. Independent number crunchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) say most people will be worse off than they were in 2019, despite the tax cuts of the last few months. And there has been a real jump in the numbers of families living in hardship.\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\nVoters don't say 'thank you'\nCan Sunak, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and others generate political credit for the modest improvements so far? Some of their colleagues in government aren't so sure.  One minister told me that when inflation was rising, Downing Street was saying: \"'Nothing to do with me, it's the Bank of England, not my fault!' Now it's come down, it's not down to them either, you can't take the credit.\"\nVoters are rarely grateful - they want to know what politicians are going to do for them next, not say thank you for what has already happened. One senior Conservative tells me that \"getting it right won't make them love us\". Another Tory source asks: \"Has anyone found evidence to suggest that if the economy in numbers terms is slightly ticking up, then that gains you some big electoral dividend?\"\nAnother senior Conservative says history even suggests the opposite. In 1997, they say, the economy was booming under a Conservative government - but that meant people felt more comfortable taking a risk on Tony Blair's Labour.\nRishi Sunak's allies tell a different story. They believe that demonstrating the economy is on the mend is the absolute priority. The plan is to create a sense that a vote for Labour might put a fragile recovery at risk.\nThat's why Labour is so paranoid about allowing any flicker of jeopardy about how they'd run the economy. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, pronounced this week that \"stability is change\" - in other words, having new people in charge, who aren't endlessly locked in leadership dramas, would make the UK a better place to do business.\nYou might not get Labour MPs rushing to put that slogan on a leaflet - and Labour's internal critics fear the leadership doesn't have enough verve in its veins. But the view at the top is that Labour must been seen as being safe. \"The public don't look at Labour and think give us something exciting, they look at us and think, can we trust you to do it,\" one source says.\nMaybe it's not just about the economy\nThere is something else going on though. When you talk to Tories about the economy, within 30 seconds the conversation often shifts to a general malaise, a discussion about how dire the situation is and, regularly, a sense of disappointment with Rishi Sunak's Downing Street.\nTo be fair, backbenchers, and even politicians in government, love to bellyache. With many of them the subtext is clear: if only the leadership listened to me the world would be a better place. But the level of despair right now is obvious.\nOne minister said acidly of Rishi Sunak: \"His competence masks his incompetence.\" They said the PM struggles to make decisions, asks for end",

    "A heartbroken community has come together in an outpouring of grief following the funerals of two teenagers who were fatally stabbed. Max Dixon, 16, and Mason Rist, 15, died in Knowle West, Bristol, on 27 January. Now an anti-knife campaigner says people are trying to build strength from tragedy.\n\"They're young children, they shouldn't be burying their schoolmates,\" said anti-knife campaigner, Leanne Reynolds.\nMax's funeral was held on Thursday , with his best friend Mason's on Friday, with both services attended by family, friends and the local community.\n\"There are no words,\" said Ms Reynolds.\n\"The boys were best friends. It's bad enough going to one funeral, but to have to do it all again the following day is really sad.\"\nThere were no flowers at the boys' funerals and instead all donations were given to the Bristol Bleed Kit Campaign, which is run by Ms Reynolds.\nShe is installing kits, which contain equipment including bandages and tourniquets to help stem the flow of blood in an emergency, at locations across Bristol.\nMs Reynolds said each kit had the potential to save a life in the crucial moments before an ambulance can arrive.\n\"One of my kits was used to save a young boy's leg, and potentially his life, so I know they work,\" she said.\n\"All the money will go back into purchasing bleed kits and putting them out in the community and training young people to use them.\n\"It's hopefully going to make a change. It's a preventative tool.\"\nThe deaths of Max and Mason have prompted a robust response from the Newquay Road Partnership (NRP), a group of Knowle West residents formed six months ago to address the issue of knife crime faced by the community.\nIt liaises directly with youth workers, councillors, police, schools, businesses and the organisation Stand Against Racism & Inequality (SARI).\nNRP believes it is uniquely placed to offer insights into the community, but has been highly critical of Bristol City Council, claiming concerns the members raised about the issue of knives in October last year were not listened to.\nChair of NRP, Carol Casey, said: \"Sadly, despite our warnings, the council did not take the necessary action.\n\"This underscores the urgent need for the council to recognise and appreciate the expertise of community groups like ours, as we possess the grassroots level and first-hand knowledge of the realities within our neighbourhood.\"\nThe group's top priority is the reopening of the former Eagle House Youth Centre as a youth club and community hub. A petition has already gained more than 1,000 signatures.\n\"Since issuing the petition the council have not replied to us,\" said Ms Casey.\n\"They have taken no steps whatsoever to hand this building back to the community despite saying they care.\n\"We have an organisation ready to run the club and are just waiting for the council to act rather than sitting on their hands and ignoring the community.\"\nBristol City Council has been approached for comment.\nSeven people have been charged - five with murder and two with assisting an offender - in connection with the deaths of Max and Mason. They remain in custody.\nOver just 18 days at the end of January and beginning of February, it was not only the two friends who lost their lives.\nDarrian Williams, 16, died after being stabbed in Rawnsley Park, Easton, and in March, Alex Mamwa, 30, was killed in a stabbing in St Paul's.\nAvon and Somerset Police launched an operation earlier this month to tackle serious violence and knife crime involving young people.\nThe operation includes high-visibility patrols and the targeting of habitual knife carriers.\nTemporary Assistant Chief Constable Peter Warren said: \"What we have seen in recent weeks in Bristol is nothing short of tragic.\n\"Children are being seriously injured and killed by people of the same age. It cannot be allowed to happen.\n\"We know we cannot police our way out of this, but we hope that our actions will provide some reassurance to communities that we are taking this seriously.\"\nThe force is also helping the Bristol Bleed Kit Campaign by installing the emergency equipment in and around the city.\nMs Reynolds said although she believed the issue of knife crime had worsened in Bristol in the past year, she hoped, with the support of the local community, to improve the situation.\n\"The deaths of these two boys affected the whole community in such a way that we just have to be around these families to build their strength, and build the whole community back,\" she said.\n\"It's absolutely fantastic, the love people have shown, and what people have done.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Shoppers in Wales have spent the most on Easter eggs while people in Scotland shelled out the least, figures suggest.\nKantar, a research firm which tracks thousands of till receipts, said that on average the Welsh spent \u00c2\u00a314.18 while the Scots handed over \u00c2\u00a312.68.\nOverall, consumers bought four chocolate eggs on average compared to six over Easter last year.\nThe price of chocolate has been rising as adverse weather and disease blights cocoa crops in West Africa.\nCocoa prices in New York have surged to a fresh record after the Ivory Coast and Ghana, which are responsible for 60% of the world's cocoa, produced less of the crop.\nOn Tuesday, Ocado Retail, which owns an online food joint venture with Marks & Spencer, said that it expected cocoa prices \"to peak at some point\". But Ocado Retail's chief executive, Hannah Gibson, said the firm expected prices to \"remain high for some time\".\nOverall, food inflation - which measures the pace at which prices are rising - has been slowing. But Kantar said that prices of confectionary made with chocolate or sugar are growing at a faster pace.\nThis year on average, people across the UK spent \u00c2\u00a313.52 on four Easter eggs over the three months to 17 March, Kantar said.

    "Labour has commissioned a review of the government's \u00c2\u00a34bn expansion of free childcare, Bridget Phillipson has said.\nThe shadow education secretary said Labour will not commit to the plan, which would see eligible parents in England get 30 free hours of childcare by September 2025.\nShe told BBC Newsnight the current system is not equipped to deal with extra demand and was a \"total mess\".\nThe government says its plan will alleviate cost of living pressures.\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan called the commitment the \"biggest expansion in childcare in our country's history\", telling the BBC it will help working parents and mean more women can get back into work after having children.\nLabour said it believed the system will not be able to provide the extra places, and said it was committed to the \"real opportunity\" free childcare system reformed on its terms to ensure that children can succeed at the earliest opportunity in their lives.\nIn the March 2023 Budget, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt committed the government to providing 30 hours of free childcare per week in term-time to working parents with children over the age of nine months.\nAt the moment working parents with children aged three and four are eligible for 30 hours of free childcare. If at least one parent earns more than \u00c2\u00a3100,000 that is limited to 15 hours a week.\nThe expanded scheme is due to be introduced in three phases:\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated the scheme will involve a doubling of the childcare free entitlement budget from \u00c2\u00a34bn last year to \u00c2\u00a38bn by 2027-28.\nSome childcare providers have warned they will not be able to recruit enough staff in time and that the eventual public funds they will receive, via local authorities, will not fully cover their costs.\nMs Phillipson told Newsnight: \"This is Liz Truss all over again. They've got no plan about how they make it happen. I think they risk crashing the childcare system just as they crashed the economy under Liz Truss.\n\"We've heard from providers that they are just going to really struggle to make this happen.\n\"And what we hear from parents right across the country is that when they go and try to access these entitlements, these commitments that the Conservatives have made, the places just aren't there.\"\nLabour has commissioned Sir David Bell, the former chief inspector of Ofsted, to conduct a review because the party believes the government has failed to prepare the childcare system for its changes.\nAsked by BBC Newsnight whether the review and her remarks meant that Labour is planning to go \"back to the drawing board\" on childcare, Ms Phillipson declined to give a commitment to adopting the government scheme if it is in power in 2025.\nShe said the plan as it stands is \"just a tacking on of additional commitments that I don't think is working, either for providers or for parents\".\nQuestioned about whether she welcomed the \u00c2\u00a34bn increase in the childcare free entitlement budget, Ms Phillipson said she welcomed more money for childcare, but she questioned the merits of making a commitment \"in the abstract\" without a proper plan.\nAsked about the scheme, Ms Keegan took issue with some childcare providers who have said the eventual rate per hour they will receive from government will not fully cover their costs, saying the government has increased the amount it gives to providers.\nShe said it would help women return to work, adding: \"In my career, I worked for a long time in many, many businesses and it was very obvious when women [would] be racing up the career ladder.\n\"And then when they started a family often their career would take a pause or even a backward step sometimes if they left and then tried to get back into the workplace.\"\nChristine Farquharson, associate director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the childcare expansion needs careful preparation.\nShe told Newsnight: \"With these new entitlements, the government is going to go from paying for around 50% of pre-school child care hours in England to around 80%.\n\"Now, when you're buying 80% of the market for anything you have to be really confident that you've got that price right - because if you set it too high, you end up paying a lot more than you might have had to, particularly at a time that other public services are under immense pressure.\n\"But if you set it too low you may find that providers are not actually willing to deliver these new entitlements, they're not willing to sign up to this new system.\"\nAre you struggling to access affordable childcare?

    "Donald Trump has just a few hours left to prevent the seizure of his assets in a business fraud case that threatens his fabled property empire.\nA deadline for him to put up the $464m (\u00c2\u00a3365m) penalty for inflating his net worth is due to expire on Monday.\nIf he fails to either secure a bond or delay the process in court, the authorities in New York can freeze his bank accounts or target his properties.\nA separate legal threat to the former president also takes shape later.\nHe may be given a date for his first criminal trial at a hearing in New York in the so-called hush money case involving adult film star Stormy Daniels.\nMr Trump is expected to attend in person to hear his lawyers argue the case should be dismissed due to the recent disclosure of thousands of documents about a key witness.\nIn the fraud case, he may yet receive a lifeline from a New York appeals court which is considering his application for a stay on the judgement.\nLast week his lawyers said he had been unable to cover the penalty despite approaching numerous financial companies to provide a bond.\nTo secure a bond, an individual has to demonstrate to the company providing the guarantee that they have enough liquidity, usually in the form of cash or stocks.\nIf Mr Trump secured a bond on Monday it would protect his assets while he continues his appeal.\nHowever, if he fails to do so, his bank accounts could be immediately frozen.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James would just need to send restraining notices to his banks and brokerage firms.\n\"That's easy and quick,\" Randy Zelin, an adjunct law professor from Cornell Law School, told the BBC. \"As soon as the bank gets that restraining notice they will shut those accounts down.\"\nThe next step would be a turnover notice signed by a judge sent to the banks and brokerage firms, at which point they hand over the money.\nThe time between the two notices would depend on how fast the prosecutor's office wants to work, said Mr Zelin. It could be just a few days.\nMr Trump could yet find the money through other means. On Friday he claimed on social media that he possessed almost $500m in cash.\nA New York judge ordered him to pay the penalty for falsely inflating his assets to secure better loans. His sons were also order to pay financial penalties.\nMs James gave a 30-day grace period from the ruling to give Mr Trump time to find the money. That expires on Monday.\nShe has previously said she is prepared to take Mr Trump's assets if he does not pay on time.\nShe recently filed the fraud judgement with clerks in Westchester County, an indication she might try to take property in New York City's northern suburbs.\nMr Trump owns Seven Springs, a golf course and 212-acre estate, in that area.\nAlso at risk are Mr Trump's prized New York properties, including the 58-floor Trump Tower, and even his assets in Florida, including his Mar-a-Lago club.\nAccording to a Forbes estimate, Mr Trump is worth about $2.6bn. He testified last year that he had $400m in liquid assets.\nThe $464m judgement is not his only expense. He was ordered to pay $83m in January after losing a defamation case to E Jean Carroll, a woman he was found to have sexually abused. He has already posted a bond in that case.\nHe is the first former president in US history to be criminally charged and faces dozens of charges across four separate cases.",
    "More than 100 tractors have rolled past the Houses of Parliament as farmers protested against what they say is a lack of support for UK food production.\nConvoys with horns blaring made their way through central London's streets to Westminster on Monday evening.\nOrganisers Save British Farming and Fairness for Farmers of Kent said cheap food imports and unsupportive policies were putting UK food security at risk.\nThe government said it put farming \"at the heart of British trade\".\nTractors flying Union flags made their way across London and through Westminster, carrying signs with slogans such as 'Save British farming' and 'No farming, no food, no future'.\n\"I'm a third generation farmer. I'm here for my future,\" Ben Stickland, 21, from West Sussex, told BBC News. \"There are multiple nails being put into this coffin built around us.\"\nThe protest comes as months of heated demonstrations in Europe, including blockades, saw angry farmers in Greece, Germany, Portugal, Poland and France demonstrating against European Union regulations and cheap imports.\nThousands of farmers also joined forces in Wales to fight new farm subsidy plans launched by its government.\nThere have previously been a handful of demonstrations in England, including in Kent and Cornwall, but Monday's tractor rally was the largest so far.\nAnother farmer attending the rally is Colin Rayner, who has 2,000 acres of arable land across east Berkshire and south Buckinghamshire.\nHe told the BBC that he had \"no choice\" but to protest, saying that business was so bad that \"this could be our last harvest\".\n\"We have been, as most farmers have been, living in our overdraft now for the last five years.\n\"We can't see it getting any better - yields have plateaued, prices are dismal, our costs for raw materials are horrendous and the regulations that we have everyday are mindboggling,\" he explained.\nMr Rayner said the environmental focus of the government's farm payments scheme, which replaced EU subsidies, was coming at the expense of domestic food production while cheap imports were being produced to lower standards.\n\"We have been farming for 500 years and the government now has a scheme where they will pay us more money to grow wildflowers than to grow food. It is insanity,\" he said.\n\"They want us to rewild the countryside. I just ask how are they going to feed the people living in the towns?\n\"We have got to have food from our own resources. We have got to produce healthy good food - which we can do.\"\nIn England, campaigners say government agricultural policy and its Environmental Land Management farm payments scheme, together with weak trade deals, \"non-existent\" import controls and misleading labelling, have all served to undermine farming businesses.\nThey say that threatens the country's ability to produce enough food to feed its own population, \"leaving our food security in peril\".\nFounder of campaign group Save British Farming Liz Webster said: \"Farming is fraught with risks: risks that have intensified every year with the climate emergency, Ukraine war and Brexit reality, which have only served to exacerbate problems.\n\"Polling shows that the public back British farming and food and want to maintain our high food standards and support local producers.\n\"We need a radical change of policy and an urgent exit from these appalling trade deals which will decimate British food.\"\nAt last month's NFU conference, the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told farmers \"I've got your back,\" as he outlined government plans to boost the UK's food security.\nIt was a promise echoed by farming minister Mark Spencer on Monday, who said: \"We firmly back our farmers.\n\"British farming is at the heart of British trade, and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.\"\nMr Spencer also announced new measures that would limit the amount of land that could be taken out of production and put into specific environmental schemes.\nThe change means that under the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) payment scheme farmers will only be able to put 25% of their land into projects that would take it out of direct food production.\n\"Food production is the primary purpose of farming and today we are taking action to clarify this principle,\" said Mr Spencer.\nThe government said that at least 60% of the food we consume will continue to be produced here in the UK and that level of food security will be monitored each year.\nIt says it has maintained the \u00c2\u00a32.4bn farming budget and was also looking at ways to improve fairness in the supply chain.\nIt has also launched a consultation on fairer food labelling regulations.",
    "A medieval wall painting uncovered in a Wiltshire church is of \"national and international significance\".\nPeter Martindale, the conservator who revealed the work in St Mary's Church, Alton Barnes, said the oldest layer could date as far back as Saxon times.\n\"Saxon wall painting is rare, so if the lower level of paint is Saxon, the importance is further heightened.\"\nThe discovery has given church members \"tantalising glimpses\" of the original picture.\nSpeaking to BBC Wiltshire , David Carson, a member of the Parochial Church Council (PCC) said, \"Peter has uncovered areas of what looks like a border around a painting, like a painted frame, in red and orange ochres.\n\"There are some tiny little fishes at the bottom of the wall and it leads him to believe that potentially there might be a figure of St Christopher,\" he said.\nThe painting is believed to have been covered up during the Reformation, when Henry VIII broke from Rome.\n\"He wanted to get rid of all the 'Popish adornments', as he referred to them, and everything was whitewashed.\n\"So those paintings haven't seen the light of day for over 500 years.\n\"Unfortunately in the intervening years, generations of people have used the church and have put up their family memorials, some of which are from the Georgian period.\n\"These covered up great chunks of the painting,\" added Mr Carson.\nSt Mary's is thought to be one of the oldest and smallest churches in England, of Saxon origin, and has been a place of worship for over 1,000 years.\nMr Martindale, who gave a talk to local residents on the discovery, explained why he was called in to look at the decoration.\n\"Internally, as a result of a need to redecorate, two layers of wall painting were revealed.\n\"The upper is medieval, possibly from the 15th Century, but the lower could be Saxon as the plaster upon which that paint lies could be original to the nave.\"\nMr Martindale said further areas of wall painting still remain hidden under later plain paint.\n\"It is important that this is kept in mind to prevent damage or loss in the future.\"\nThe PCC now hopes to raise money to enable work to restore the paintings and expose more of them.\n\"There is no time limit,\" said Mr Carson, \"but this is something we'd love to do.

    "Israel has cancelled a meeting in Washington after the US declined to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nThe resolution, which also called for the release of all hostages, followed several failed attempts at similar measures since the 7 October attacks.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the US of having \"abandoned\" its previous policy.\nMeanwhile intense fighting rages between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\nThe UN Security Council's first resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire came after calls for urgent action to avert a famine in Gaza.\nSince the start of the conflict, the US has used its veto power to block three Security Council resolutions calling for pauses in the fighting or a ceasefire. Another two have been vetoed by both Russia and China.\nOn Monday, the US abstained on a resolution that called for an \"immediate\" ceasefire for the rest of the month of Ramadan - two weeks - and the \"immediate and unconditional release of all hostages\".\nThe 14 other members of the council, including the UK, voted in favour, meaning the resolution passed.\nWhile Washington has taken an increasingly tougher stance on Israel it insisted its abstention did not mark a shift in policy.\nBut Mr Netanyahu said the UN resolution did not make the demand for a ceasefire conditional on the release of the hostages, as the US and Israel had both argued it should.\nIsrael believes Hamas and its allies are still holding about 130 hostages in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.\n\"Today's resolution gives Hamas hope that international pressure will force Israel to accept a ceasefire without the release of our hostages, thus harming both the war effort and the effort to release the hostages,\" Mr Netanyahu's office said in a statement.\nIt added that, \"in light of the change in the US position\", a visit by an Israeli delegation to the US this week would not go ahead.\nIsraeli and US officials had been due to meet to discuss Israel's planned offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where some 1.5 million Palestinians have sought shelter, having fled the fighting elsewhere in Gaza.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said publicly that a ground operation in Rafah risks killing more civilians and is \"not the way\" to defeat Hamas.\nOn the ground there was no indication of a let up in hostilities, as Israeli warplanes continued to bomb Rafah.\nFierce gun battles also raged around hospitals in nearby Khan Younis and Gaza City. Rocket warning sirens also sounded in Israeli border towns.\nResponding to Mr Netanyahu's decision to cancel the Israeli delegation's visit to Washington, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said it was \"disappointing\" but reiterated the US view that \"a major ground offensive in Rafah would be a major mistake\".\nMr Kirby said that scheduled meetings between Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan would go ahead as planned.\nYair Lapid, Israel's opposition leader and former prime minister, criticised Mr Netanyahu's decision, described the episode as \"unnecessary\" and said Mr Netanyahu had been \"irresponsible\".\n\"Bad for Israel. Bad for security, bad for the economy,\" he said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"Sometimes you have to say 'no' to the Americans. Israel is indeed an independent country, and we do not need anyone's permission to defend ourselves. [But] it is better to keep the quarrels in closed rooms.\"\nUN Security Council resolutions are widely considered to be legally binding on UN member states, although the US has said it does not consider Monday's vote to be binding on Israel.\nMr Gallant has said Israel will not stop the war in Gaza while hostages are still being held there. The hostages were seized when Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people, most of them civilians.\nThe Palestinian representative to the UN, Riyad Mansour, welcomed the resolution but said it was overdue.\n\"It has taken six months, over 100,000 Palestinians killed and maimed, two million displaced, and famine, for this council to finally demand an immediate ceasefire,\" he said.\nHamas has welcomed the vote, but also told mediators it was sticking to its original demands for a comprehensive ceasefire which include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a return of displaced Palestinians to the north of the Strip.\nThe Israeli Prime Minister's Office described this as \"unrealistic.\"\nTalks between Israeli and Hamas representatives continue via mediators in Qatar. Reports suggest that a deal currently being proposed would see 40 Israeli hostages released in exchange for 800 Palestinian prisoners.\nMonday's resolution came amid huge concern over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.\nLast week, Mr Blinken warned that the entire population of Gaza was experiencing \"severe levels of acute food insecurity\".\nThe UN World Food Programme has also warned that, in Gaza's two northern governorates, famine is expected to se",
    "Colombia is expelling a number of Argentine diplomats in response to insults levelled by the Argentine president against his Colombian counterpart.\nIn a CNN interview, the Argentine leader, Javier Milei, called Colombian President Gustavo Petro a \"murdering terrorist\".\nHe also said the Mexican president was \"ignorant\".\nMr Milei is infamous for his colourful language and abrasive rhetoric.\nWhile personal attacks are not uncommon in Latin American politics, Mr Milei surprised many when he attacked Pope Francis last year, calling the pontiff \"an imbecile who defends social justice\".\nWhile the Pope dismissed the remarks and the two men embraced during a meeting at the Vatican, Latin American politicians have not been as forgiving.\nThe CNN interview which has caused the latest stir will be broadcast on Sunday, but the channel has released some clips ahead of transmission.\nIn one of them, Mr Milei suggests that Colombia under left-wing President Petro could deteriorate and come to resemble Venezuela and Cuba.\n\"In Venezuela, there's carnage, it's truly unprecedented, same as on that prison island, Cuba,\" he tells CNN's Andr\u00c3\u00a9s Oppenheimer.\n\"And there are others who're going down that road, such as Colombia with Mr Petro,\" he adds.\n\"Well, you can't expect much from someone who was a murdering terrorist, right?\" he asks in an apparent reference to Mr Petro's past as a former rebel fighter.\nMr Petro was a member of the now disbanded M-19 guerrilla group in the 1980s.\nAs part of its war against the Colombian state, the group stormed the Palace of Justice in the Colombian capital, Bogot\u00c3\u00a1, in 1985, and held more than 300 people hostage.\nThe security forces lay siege to the building and more than 100 people died in the ensuing battle to retake it from the M-19. The incident is known as \"28 hours of terror\" in Colombia.\nBut while Mr Petro was a member of the M-19 guerrilla group, he did not take part in the attack on the Palace of Justice. He was in jail at the time for his involvement with the group.\nMr Petro has never made a secret out of his past inside the M-19, which demobilised more than 30 years ago.\nAs Colombia's first left-wing president, he has come in for plenty of criticism at home, but there has been widespread outrage in the Andean country over the comments made by Mr Milei.\nThe foreign ministry said Mr Milei had offended President Petro's \"dignity\" and said it would expel a number of Argentine diplomats, without specifying how many.\nIn Mexico, the two candidates vying to replace President Andr\u00c3\u00a9s Manuel L\u00c3\u00b3pez Obrador as president in the election in June also came to his defence.\nThey demanded that the Argentine leader treat Mr L\u00c3\u00b3pez Obrador with respect after Mr Milei said in the CNN interview that the fact that the \"ignorant\" Mexican president had spoken badly of him only flattered him.\nMr L\u00c3\u00b3pez Obrador has in the past labelled Mr Milei \"a fascist ultra-conservative\".",

At this point, I'd been told I had a clot on my brain so I was quite scared.\"\nDoctor Souhyb Masri, a consultant interventional neuroradiologist at the Walton Centre, said: \"Whenever someone experiences a stroke, getting it treated in the right way quickly is of paramount importance.\n\"Jess having the procedure means she can rehabilitate as best she can, and I'm confident she will continue to recover well.\"\nIn October 2021, The Walton Centre became the first facility in the north-west of England to offer thrombectomies to stroke patients 24/7 and it has since carried out almost 400 procedures.\nAccording to the NHS, people over the age of 55 are more likely to have a stroke, although one in five occur in younger people.\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "There is \"no evidence\" linking the alleged mastermind of an armed robbery to the guns used to shoot two police officers, a trial has been told.\nPC Sharon Beshenivsky was fatally shot after interrupting a raid at a travel agents in Bradford in November 2005.\nHer colleague, PC Theresa Milburn, was shot in the chest but survived.\nPiran Ditta Khan, 75, is on trial at Leeds Crown Court accused of murder and four firearms offences, having previously pleaded guilty to robbery.\nJurors have been told that seven men were involved in carrying out the robbery, with alleged ringleader Mr Khan the last to face trial after he was extradited from Pakistan last year.\nProsecutors have claimed that although Mr Khan was not one of the three armed men who went into the travel agents, and did not leave the safety of a lookout car during the raid, he was still guilty of PC Beshenivsky's murder because of his \"pivotal\" role in planning the robbery, knowing loaded weapons would be used.\nBut in his closing speech on Monday, Peter Wright KC, Mr Khan's defence barrister, told the court there was nothing to show his client was linked to the guns used in the raid on the Universal Express travel agents on 18 November 2005.\nMr Wright reminded jurors of evidence which had been heard from Francois Baron, who was working on renovating a so-called \"safe house\" in Leeds which was used by the robbers before and after the raid.\nHe said Mr Baron's evidence was that the firearms had been produced by one of the group before Mr Khan arrived at the house the day before the robbery.\n\"There is no evidence firearms were ever brandished or produced in Piran Ditta Khan's presence, or at any time after he arrived,\" Mr Wright said.\n\"The following day, there is no evidence weapons were visible to anyone prior to their production at Universal Express.\"\nWhile Mr Khan denies murder, two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon, Mr Wright said his client had admitted he \"was involved in a plot to commit robbery\".\nHe \"deserves no sympathy for his conduct\", Mr Wright added.\n'Competing issues'\nThe court had earlier heard that Mr Khan claimed he was owed \u00c2\u00a312,000 by the owner of the travel agents, Mohammad Yousaf, which debt collector Hassan Razzaq offered to help him get back after they met through a business associate.\nHowever, Mr Khan told jurors he did not know weapons were to be used and believed the men Razzaq sent would at most \"slap\" the staff in order to recover the cash.\nMr Wright said there was no evidence Mr Khan was \"the man in charge\", as prosecutors had claimed.\nHe told jurors: \"The issues in this case are not to be determined by a binary, simple choice between good and evil, or right and wrong, but by a dispassionate and measured analysis of the competing issues.\"\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

So I ended up sprinting at the end of the end of 60 hours of burning through the forest, which felt really hard,\" she said.\nHer arms and legs are covered in scratches from the brambles she had to push through on the route, very little of which is on a path.\n\"Brambles would get you and it was like having somebody cut you and that would happen loop after loop and it was like doing it back over the same scars,\" she said.\nJasmin slumped to the ground as she crossed the finish line, and said she felt \"overwhelming relief\" that it was finally over.\nBut she said completing such a challenge was \"mind-opening\" and inspires you with confidence for your whole life.\n\"I did it for me and I'm super happy that I achieved what I set out to do after the three years of trying\", Jasmin explained.\n\"But I'm glad that I kind of did it for women worldwide as well - not just runners - but any woman that wants to take on a challenge and maybe doesn't have the confidence.\n\"The idea that I might have inspired them to believe in themselves\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that's huge, especially all the young girls - you know how hard it is to keep young girls in sports.\"\nThe Barkley course was the brainchild of Gary \"Lazarus Lake\" Cantrell and Karl Henn, after they heard about a famous escape nearby Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary\nJames Earl Ray, the assassin of Martin Luther King Jr, eluded capture for more than 50 hours, but only travelled about 12 miles (19 km).\nMr Cantrell is said to have commented he could have run 100 miles in the time.\nJasmin, who was born in Hadfield in Derbyshire, said the isolation of the race was one of the biggest challenges.\n\"You're totally on your own out there and most races will have checkpoints where they have, you know, some volunteers or checkpoint staff to feed you and give you a bit of a cheer and send you on your way.

    "The family and friends of a woman murdered by her abusive partner say she was let down by a \"bankrupt\" system.\nMichaela Hall was killed by Lee Kendall at her home in Cornwall, in May 2021.\nJust weeks before her death the Probation Service wrongly assessed Kendall as posing a \"medium risk\" of harm.\nPeter Hall, Michaela's father, believes the mistake \"probably signed Michaela's death warrant\".\nIn addition, despite an emergency call warning that she was being attacked, police officers did not try to force entry to her home.\nAt an inquest which ended on Friday, the coroner criticised the Probation Service and the actions of the police.\nMichaela's family says her story is a tragic example of how a manipulative and violent man can isolate and abuse a woman.\nAnd how the system can fail.\nFeared for her life\nOn the evening of 31 May 2021, Michaela was on the phone from her home in Cornwall to her friend Clair Basnett, who lived abroad.\nMichaela told her she was with Kendall, and she feared for her life.\n\"She was whispering. She didn't know what to do,\" says Clair.\n\"I asked her if she could get out of the house. She said no, he's taken the keys.\"\nMichaela had been in a relationship with Kendall, an ex-prisoner who was an alcoholic and former drug addict, since 2019.\nHe had a history of violence, and had even spent time in prison for attacking Michaela.\nClair says she then heard Kendall attack her friend.\n\"You could hear him screaming at her,\" she says. \"And then she's obviously dropped the phone as he has hit her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I could hear her start to scream.\"\nClair rang Crimestoppers, who called Devon and Cornwall Police.\nAfter a 20-minute delay, two officers were dispatched to her house. There had been numerous call-outs before - on this occasion, they saw no sign of a disturbance and heard nothing.\nBody-worn camera footage recorded one of the officers talking to the police control room, saying how they had visions of \"her lying there with him covering her mouth\".\nBut believing they did not have the power to force entry, the officers left and returned to base.\nPeter says it is scary to think that police officers on an emergency call could leave a possible victim helpless.\nOfficers returned to the property twice over the next 18 hours, but never tried to enter.\nIt was left to her father to find a key and go into the house by himself - a full day after the first emergency call. There, he found Michaela's body.\nClair Basnett is angry at the police's inaction.\n\"I think it's disgusting,\" she says. \"They should have gone in. There's no two ways about it.\n'A very dark place'\nMichaela, a single mother of two, had started a relationship with Kendall in 2019, while working with a prisoner resettlement charity.\nPeter says his daughter told him everything was okay.\n\"She kept assuring us that this guy is perfectly safe, and he will be perfectly fine,\" he says.\nBut Kendall was an alcoholic drug user with at least 50 convictions, who was known to be violent and manipulative.\nPeter says that in the early stages, he did not think Michaela was aware that she was being manipulated or controlled.\nHowever, Clair says it was clear from the beginning that Kendall was abusive. She says that he deliberately tried to cut Michaela off from friends and family.\nClair also saw Michaela covering up bruises. \"She was spiralling into a very dark place,\" she says.\nOver the next two years Michaela called the police on more than a dozen occasions.\nShe suffered black eyes and even a fractured cheekbone but could not bring herself to press charges.\nMichaela's situation was well known to the authorities, who classed her as being \"at very high risk\" of abuse.\nBut she appeared to refuse all offers of help.\nAt one stage, Kendall was sent back to prison for breaching the terms of his parole for previous offences.\nPolice, probation and social services all discussed Michaela's case at Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conferences or Maracs.\nAfter one meeting an official wrote that she had \"never wanted support from any agencies\".\nLater, Michaela was the subject of what was called a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO), which did not require her consent.\nIt was designed to prevent Kendall contacting her, but he breached the DVPO on at least three occasions.\nHe spent a short time in prison for his attacks on Michaela, but phoned her every day, persuading her to take him back.\nClair says she spoke to Michaela on the phone for hours about pressing charges against him.\n\"I thought she was actually going to go ahead and do it, but at the last minute she pulled out.\"\nWhen Kendall was released in May 2021, he went straight back to live with Michaela in the village of Mount Hawke, near Truro.\nWithin weeks she was dead.\nKendall was jailed for life last year, with a minimum 21-year term for her murder.\nShortcomings and errors\nAt the inquest into Michaela's death, the coroner, Andrew Cox, singled out the probation service for criticism.\nWeeks before her murder, Kendall had been cla",

    "The Guardian says Monday's call by the UN Security Council for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza has left Israel in \"near total isolation\" on the world stage. It describes the development as a \"significant break\" between the Biden administration and the Israeli government and says it represents \"a long-delayed show of international unity\".\nThe Daily Telegraph says Downing Street faced a \"backlash\" from Conservative MPs on Monday night, after the UK helped to pass the UN resolution. It says the Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron, was challenged by four of his party colleagues at a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee, with those who spoke up asking why Britain had backed the motion when the US had abstained.\nThe Daily Mail says Rishi Sunak is facing \"fury\" at what it calls his \"feeble\" rebuke to China, after the UK and the US revealed the scale of Beijing's efforts to subvert Western democracy via a wave of cyber-attacks. An unnamed MP who was targeted by China is quoted saying ministers had \"turned up to a gunfight with a wooden spoon\" - after the government announced sanctions against two hackers and a small firm in Wuhan. The Times says China is set to be formally declared a threat to Britain's national security , but some Tory MPs have warned that does not go far enough.\nSeveral leader columns call on the government to get tough with China. \"It's time to stand up to Chinese meddling,\" says the Daily Express . \"Beijing's threats must be firmly challenged,\" insists the Telegraph . Writing in the same paper , the former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, warns that the UK has \"dragged its feet in facing up to this growing threat\".  He repeats the analogy he made in the Commons yesterday - likening the government's announcement of sanctions to \"watching an elephant giving birth to a mouse\" - and says ministers must now make clear that China presents a \"systemic threat\".\nThe departure of Boeing's chief executive and chairman is the main story for the Financial Times , after the aircraft manufacturer announced a management shake-up. The paper describes the changes as an attempt to \"draw a line\" under the recent safety crisis, triggered when a door panel fell off a plane mid-flight in January. It says Dave Calhoun's decision to step down as Boeing's boss has been welcomed by the company's customers - including Ryanair, which said it hoped the new management team would help to eliminate delays to the deliveries of new aircraft.\nWith the headline \"The Kate effect\", the Daily Mirror highlights a huge search in online checks for cancer symptoms, after Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed she was undergoing treatment for the disease. The paper says she has been praised for raising awareness by health bosses and charities who say it could save lives. The Sun reports that visits to the NHS cancer symptoms website averaged one every three seconds in the hours after the princess made her diagnosis public.

However, at this time, we are not treating this as a firearms-related report.\"\n'Lovely family'\nDUP assembly member for South Down Diane Forsythe described a \"lovely family\" at the centre of the incident, adding what happened was \"absolutely shocking and horrific\".\n\"This is absolutely devastating and heart-breaking for Kilkeel and the wider Mourne area,\" she told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster.\n\"It's fair to say the community is completely numb as the news broke yesterday,\" she continued.\n\"This is a well-known family who we just all have in our thoughts and prayers at this devastating time.\"\nAnne Coffey from New Beginnings charity shop in Kilkeel said she knew Mr McKee well through Mourne Presbyterian Church where she said he was a caretaker.\n\"Everybody's devastated,\" Ms Coffey said.\nShe said church members would \"rally around as a family\" for those affected.\nCh Insp Lynne Corbett acknowledged \"the Kilkeel and wider Mourne community will feel both shocked and saddened by what has happened\".\n\"Our thoughts are with the family as they struggle to come to terms with what has happened, and they have our full sympathy at this time.\"\nShe urged members of the public not to speculate on the incident.",
    "The Australian Football League (AFL) has denied it has a cocaine problem, after whistleblowers claimed abuse of the drug is widespread in the sport.\nIn a speech to parliament on Tuesday, an MP accused the Melbourne Demons club - and the AFL broadly - of covering up breaches of the league's drug policy.\nPlayers were being asked to fake injuries to avoid match day drug tests, Andrew Wilkie said.\nThe AFL's boss did not deny those claims, but said drug use was uncommon.\nThe Australian Rules football competition draws the biggest fan attendances of any sport nationally.\nMr Wilkie used parliamentary privilege to air the allegations, which he says were provided to him by three people. They are former Demons president Glen Bartlett, former club doctor Zeeshan Arain, and Shaun Smith, a former player and father to current Demons player Joel Smith.\nIn his speech, Mr Wilkie claimed \"off-the-books\" tests were conducted at a Melbourne pathology clinic and facilitated by a former AFL chief medical officer.\nPlayers that tested positive were \"advised to lie about their condition\" and the results were kept secret from governing bodies like Sports Integrity Australia (SIA) or the World Anti-Doping Agency, and even team coaches, the MP said.\nThose who test positive for illicit drugs on match days face penalties - including bans - under the anti-doping code.\n\"In other words, hundreds of thousands of Australians will watch the game not knowing that the game has been secretly manipulated by the AFL,\" Mr Wilkie said.\nThe Demons' coach said he was surprised by the claims and had no knowledge of the alleged practice. The team's captain has also previously denied the club has a drug culture.\nIn a press conference, AFL chief executive Andrew Dillon said the sport conducted its own illicit drug testing, on top of tests done by governing bodies.\n\"If there's a chance that they may have something in their system, we don't want them training and we don't them taking part in matches for their health and welfare above anything else,\" he said.\nHe did not address the allegation that footballers were told to fake injury so that others were unaware of their results, but said players had a right to doctor-patient privilege.\nThe AFL is reviewing its illicit drugs policy, he added, but the sport does not have a drug problem.\n\"What we're talking about here is a small handful of players over a year,\" he said.\nEarlier this week two AFL Women's players from the Sydney Swans club were suspended for two matches each over cocaine possession.\nAnd last month Joel Smith - who is suspended from playing - was accused by the SIA of possessing and \"trafficking or attempted trafficking\" cocaine. He has not been criminally charged.",
    "Donald Trump will face the first ever criminal trial of a former US president on 15 April over alleged hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\nJustice Juan Merchan denied the defence's request to delay the case.\nMr Trump faces four criminal cases, but this may be the only one to make it to a courtroom before November's election.\nHe has pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony charges, arguing the claims do not constitute \"a crime\".\nAfter spending much of Monday morning sitting next to his attorneys inside the courtroom, Mr Trump told reporters that the case should be considered \"election interference\".\n\"It's a disgrace, and we will obviously be appealing,\" he said. \"But this is a pure case of voter intimidation and election interference, and it shouldn't be allowed to happen.\"\nDuring his bid to retake the White House, the former president and his legal team have sought to delay as many of his trials as possible.\nThe trial was originally set to begin with jury selection on Monday, but it was delayed after thousands of documents were released last week from the 2018 federal investigation into the payments to Ms Daniels.\nJudge Merchan held a hearing on Monday centred on whether there had been any wrongdoing in the sudden release last week of more than 200,000 pages of documents related to the federal prosecutors' case.\nMr Trump's legal team claimed the Manhattan district attorney's office had engaged in misconduct by not doing enough to get the federal prosecutors to hand over the documents in a timely manner. They alleged prosecutors were attempting to \"suppress\" evidence.\nThe document release followed a request by Mr Trump's attorneys in January for records from the federal case. Justice Merchan questioned why the defence had not discussed the long wait with him earlier.\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's office had agreed to a delay of 30 days for the documents to be reviewed, but prosecutors said at the hearing that they believed only 300 new documents needed to be considered.\nMr Trump's legal team demanded more time to review the documents, and pushed for a 90-day delay.\nOn Monday, Justice Merchan grilled Mr Trump's lawyer to specify how many of the \"thousands\" of documents they would consider relevant and requiring review for this case.\nMr Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, painted a broad picture of what was in the new batch, which he said included records from the Robert Mueller investigation - the federal inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nThough Justice Merchan pressed him to narrow his focus to the case at hand, Mr Blanche maintained that the relevant records numbered in the thousands.\n\"We got the material a week ago,\"he said. \"We're still going through them.\"\nThe judge, however, appeared impatient and unpersuaded by the attorney's arguments, including the claim that prosecutors had acted unethically.\nDuring a tense exchange, Mr Blanche could not give a satisfactory argument that Mr Bragg's team had violated a statute concerning how prosecutors must share evidence.\n\"That you don't have a case right now is really disconcerting,\" Justice Merchan told Mr Blanche.\nThe judge said that the defence appeared keen on accusing prosecutors of misconduct \"and trying to make me complicit in it\", without providing a compelling legal argument.\n\"It's odd that we're even here and that we've taken this time,\" he said.\nJustice Merchan ultimately ruled that the district attorney's office was \"not at fault\" for the late production of evidence from federal prosecutors, and made \"diligent efforts\" to produce the relevant documents.\nAs he gaveled the hearing to a close, Justice Merchan told Mr Trump and the dozens of assembled lawyers and press: \"See you all on the 15th.\"",
    "Giant salamanders and some of the world's largest frogs and turtles are among the creatures with a new home at London Zoo.\nThe Secret Life of Reptiles and Amphibians exhibit opens on 29 March.\nIt will house more than 30 species, some which are highly unusual and endangered.\nThe zoo supports their conservation, captive breeding programme, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said.\nVisitors will be able to see the zoo's group of mountain chicken frogs, which were airlifted to safety from their Caribbean home in 2009 in a last-ditch bid to save the species from extinction due to a killer fungus.\nThey are kept in a bio-secure unit to protect them from disease, with sterilised soil and plants dipped in dilute bleach solution, before being placed in the enclosure and staff changing their clothes before working with them.\nAlso among the residents of the exhibit are two Chinese giant salamanders, the world's largest amphibians, which were rescued from being smuggled in a cereal box in 2016, before coming to live in the zoo.\nIt is hoped the critically endangered pair will breed as the keepers say it is likely they are a male and female.\nSome 16 of the creatures in the exhibit are \"Edge\" species meaning they have few evolutionary relatives and are often extremely unusual in their genetic make-up and the way they look, live and behave.\nThey include the crocodile lizard, which has no more that 1,000 individuals in the wild in southern China and northern Vietnam, and the big-headed turtle - which, as the name suggests, has a large head that cannot retract into its shell.\nFour adult big-headed turtles came to the zoo in 2018, having been confiscated after being smuggled in Canada, and seven youngsters were born in 2021, making London Zoo the first European zoo to breed them.\nAmphibian and reptile species are threatened by habitat loss and being caught for meat and the pet trade, while amphibians in particular are at risk from disease such as chytrid fungus which all but wiped out mountain chicken frogs.\nThe team at ZSL says having animals in their care means they are able to research and learn about their lives and behaviour in ways that can help their survival in the wild.\nFor example, they are carrying out analysis of their Ethiopian mountain adders to see if the patterns on the snakes are stable, and if so could be used as identifiers of individual snakes which would support monitoring and conservation in the wild.\nThe secret life of reptiles and amphibians building has been designed to meet the needs of each of its 33 species, with different climate-controlled zones, and staff checking temperatures, water quality and humidity on a daily basis.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Long before Donald Trump stepped into the White House, his glitzy and glamorous real estate empire helped make him a nationally recognised star.\nNow, a judge's ruling that he defrauded the state of New York, the centre of that empire, has put the fate of some of his flagship properties into doubt.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James has begun preparing to seize his assets in case he does not pay a penalty of nearly half a billion dollars.\nMr Trump is appealing the ruling.\nBut he must submit the full $464m penalty in cash or secure a bond from a private company by 25 March if he wants to continue the appeal without the state seizing his assets.\nLast year, Forbes estimated that Mr Trump's New York properties alone are worth $720m (\u00c2\u00a3589m), a sizable chunk of the former president's estimated $2.5bn fortune.\nLet's take a look at some of the properties that Mr Trump might lose.\nTrump Tower\nLocated on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the 58-floor Trump Tower is among the most recognisable properties bearing Mr Trump's name. The building is the headquarters of the embattled Trump Organization and has been home to Mr Trump and several of his family members.\nThe building - which was developed by Mr Trump and inaugurated in 1983 - has also featured prominently in popular culture, including serving as the location for Batman's Wayne Enterprises in Christopher Nolan's 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises.\nMr Trump's penthouse condominium that spans the top three floors of the building is also among the properties that he was found in the New York lawsuit to have overvalued.\nThe penthouse was valued at $327m in 2015, a price that the lawsuit called \"absurd\".\n\"Tripling the size of the apartment for purposes of the valuation was intentional and deliberate fraud,\" the lawsuit reads. \"Not an honest mistake\".\nMs James appears to be preparing for possibly taking the famous tower if Mr Trump does not pay the penalty. She has filed the judgement with New York's government, the first legal step toward seizing assets.\nSeven Springs Estate\nVaunted as \"one of the most prestigious private estates\" by the Trump Organization, the verdant 212-acre estate stretches across the towns of Bedford, Armonk and Chappaqua in New York's Westchester Country. It was built in 1919 by former Washington Post publisher Eugene Meyer and bought by the Trump Organization in 1996.\nA large Georgian-style mansion surrounded by nature preserves, the property is atypical of Mr Trump's holdings, which tend to sparkle and shine with gold-plated d\u00c3\u00a9cor.\nAs is the case with the other properties in the lawsuit, the Trumps were found to have overinflated its value.\nMs James has also filed the judgement with the Westchester County clerk's office.\n40 Wall Street\nOriginally completed in 1930, the 72-story neo-Gothic tower in the heart of New York's financial district was purchased by a Trump-controlled company in 1995. The building's website proudly boasts that the purchase was \"one of the great real estate deals of all time\".\nSince the purchase, the building's tenants have included global giants such as American Express, defunct investment bank Bear Stearns and Hilton Hotels & Resorts.\nIn the New York lawsuit, prosecutors alleged that the values given by Mr Trump and the Trump Organization \"far exceeded the values determined by professionals\" in lender-ordered appraisals.\nIn 2012, for example, the property was valued by the company at $572m in financial statements - more than twice the value reached by the outside appraisals.\nBy last year, the building had been added to a lender watchlist because of concerns over rising expenses and vacancies, according to Bloomberg.\nMar-a-Lago\nAsset seizures could potentially extend beyond New York's borders to properties controlled by New York based limited liability companies, or LLCs.\nThat includes Mr Trump's famous 17-acre Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where he currently resides.\nIn his ruling, Judge Engoron determined that Mr Trump inflated the value of Mar-a-Lago by as much as 2,300%.\nThe ruling cited an appraisal from the Palm Beach County Assessor's office, which placed the property's value at between $18m and $27.6m.\nMr Trump has blasted that value repeatedly, and on X,  formerly known as Twitter, his son Eric Trump speculated that Mar-a-Lago is worth a billion dollars, \"making it arguably the most valuable residential property in the country\".\nDonald Trump Jr has also mocked the assessment writing: \"If Mar-a-Lago is worth $18 million... I'll take 10 please!!\"",
    "A vicar from Devon ran from John O'Groats to Land's End in 16 days as part of a fundraising campaign.\nReverend Justin Montague, a former Royal Marine, is in charge of St Michael's Church in Beer and St Gregory's Church in Seaton.\nThe funds raised from his endeavour, which was completed on Sunday, will go to his churches and the Royal Marines Charity.\nHe said completing the \"iconic\" run had been a \"dream\" of his for a long time.\nMr Montague set off from Scotland with his wife Melissa on 8 March and the pair arrived at Land's End in Cornwall on 24 March.\nHe said: \"As I come down to earth and take in the last couple of weeks and reflect upon the run I wish to extend my heartfelt gratitude to so many, many people who have made this possible.\n\"Your support, encouragement, generosity and belief in me, has driven me every step, lifted me and drove me forwards.\n\"Thank you to every single person who has supported our charities with a penny or pound, to that we have been blown away and know the fantastic and varied good work they all do.\"\nThe vicar said he hit \"a rock bottom point in my life\" after being diagnosed with a long-term illness 10 years ago, but the \"Royal Marines family lifted me back up\".\nThe charity aims to ensure \"no one is left behind\" and offer \"lifelong support\" to the Royal Marines family.\n\"The route is iconic and for any ultra distance runner it's a dream,\" Mr Montague said.\n\"It's been a dream of mine for well over a decade.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

    "The US must assure Julian Assange has freedom of speech protections and will not receive the death penalty before he is extradited, judges have ruled.\nThe UK High Court said the Wikileaks founder could be allowed to launch a new appeal against being sent to the US without those commitments.\nUS authorities say Mr Assange endangered lives by publishing thousands of classified documents.\nHis lawyers have argued that the case is a form of \"state retaliation\".\nThe court has adjourned its final decision on Mr Assange's extradition by three weeks to give the US government time to comply with its order.\nSpeaking after the ruling was published, Mr Assange's wife called on US President Joe Biden to \"drop this shameful case\".\nTuesday's court order is the latest twist in a legal saga which began when Mr Assange's website Wikileaks published confidential US documents in 2010 and 2011.\nHis supporters say the leak exposed US criminality but Mr Assange was widely condemned for failing to redact the names of intelligence operatives, potentially putting their lives at risk.\nThe 52-year-old Australian national attempted to avoid extradition to the US by seeking refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London but was arrested in 2019 and has been held in UK prisons since.\nIn June 2022, then Home Secretary Priti Patel ruled Mr Assange could be extradited to the US to face trial for 18 offences, a decision which his lawyers have challenged in the courts.\nIn February, his lawyers submitted nine grounds to the High Court on which they believed Ms Patel's extradition order was unlawful.\nSix were rejected outright - however, in a written judgment on Tuesday, Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Johnson said Mr Assange had an \"arguable case\" on their remaining grounds for appeal.\nThe first two boil down to whether or not Mr Assange would have freedom of expression protections under the US constitution as a foreign national.\nThe judges also accepted there are insufficient guarantees Mr Assange will not face the death penalty in the US, which his lawyers argue should have prohibited the UK government from agreeing to send him there.\nMr Assange is not charged with any offence in the US which carries the death penalty - however, his lawyers fear he could be further charged with a treason or espionage crime in the future which does.\nIn their evidence, they pointed to comments made by former US President Donald Trump - who is set to be the Republican nominee in the election later this year - which were supportive of Mr Assange receiving the death penalty.\nThe US has repeatedly pointed out Mr Assange is not charged with a death penalty offence, and has previously given the courts an assurance they would allow him to serve his prison sentence in Australia if convicted.\nIf the US does give further assurances in the next three weeks, a final hearing could take place on 20 May.\n\"If assurances are not given then we will grant leave to appeal without a further hearing,\" said Dame Victoria in the court's ruling.\n\"If assurances are given then we will give the parties an opportunity to make further submissions before we make a final decision on the application for leave to appeal.\"\nIf Mr Assange's latest appeal is not granted, he will have exhausted all of his legal avenues in the UK. His remaining option would be to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights.\nSpeaking to the crowd gathered outside the court, his wife Stella Assange described her husband as a \"political prisoner\".\nShe added: \"The case should have just been thrown out and Julian should not have spent a single day in prison.\n\"The United States is bringing a case based on the persecution of a journalist for his political opinions.\"\nMr Assange's lawyers say he faces up to 175 years in jail if he is convicted - but the US government has previously said a sentence of between four and six years is more likely.\nThey took his case to the European Court of Human Rights in 2022, but it was dismissed without a hearing.\nAustralia's parliament has passed a motion calling on the UK and US to release Mr Assange, though this has no legal bearing on either government.",
    "Whooping cough cases in Wales have hit an 11-year high, following concerns about rising cases from the start of the year.\nThere were 122 cases reported to Public Health Wales in the week ending 18 March.\nThat is the highest weekly total since the end of 2012.\nPublic health officials have urged all pregnant women and parents of babies and young children to ensure they are vaccinated.\nWhooping cough, known as pertussis, is a bacterial infection of the lungs and breathing tubes and is highly contagious.\nIt is spread by breathing in small droplets in the air from other people's coughs and sneezes.\nIn the last six weeks, cases have been reported in all but one of Wales' local authority areas, with the highest numbers in Cardiff, Bridgend, Gwynedd, Powys, Swansea and Vale of Glamorgan.\nSo far in 2024 there have been more cases reported than in the previous five years combined.\nChristopher Williams, consultant epidemiologist in health protection for Public Health Wales, said: \"Notifications of whooping cough in Wales were falling but have risen again this week, and Public Health Wales is actively monitoring the situation.\"\n\"Whooping cough has waves of increased infection every three to four years, and following reduced circulation in 2020-2022, current notifications are at levels not seen since 2012 and 2015.\"\nThe most recent figures show 95% of babies being vaccinated and 70% of pregnant women.\nCases have also been rising in London and the south east, East Midlands and Yorkshire and Humber in recent weeks.\nWhat is whooping cough?\nIt can present similarly to a cold initially but lead to coughing bouts, according to the NHS.\nThe name comes from a \"whoop\" sound which some sufferers get, when they gasp for breath between coughs and coughing can last for several weeks.\nPeople are recommended to get rest and take plenty of fluids but may be prescribed antibiotics if in the infectious early stages.\nDr Williams said the whooping cough vaccine was included in the \"6-in-1 vaccine\" given to babies at eight, 12 and 16 weeks, as well as a pre-school booster dose at around three years and four months.\n\"Since 2013 pregnant women have been offered a pertussis (whooping cough) vaccination from weeks 16-32 of pregnancy, to protect newborn babies before they receive their 6 in 1 vaccine,\" he said.\n\"We would urge all pregnant women and parents of babies and young children to ensure they take up their offer of vaccination when given, or to ask their GP, midwife or health visitor if they believe they may not have had it.\"",

    "Donald Trump's lawyers are asking a New York court to put a $464m (\u00c2\u00a3365m) fine in a civil fraud case on hold, as the former president finds himself in a precarious financial situation that could ultimately see his most prized properties taken.\nIf Mr Trump wants to continue his appeal in the case without the state seizing the fine from him, he must submit the full amount in cash or secure a bond from a private company by 25 March.\nOn Monday, his lawyers said that despite their \"diligent efforts\" it had been \"practically impossible\" to find a company willing to act as a guarantor of the full sum and asked for a pause.\n\"We really are in a moment of serious crisis for Trump personally, as well as for his business,\" said Professor Will Thomas from the University of Michigan Ross Business School.\nJust days later, however, Mr Trump said on his social media site Truth Social that he had secured more than $500m in cash that could be used as collateral for a bond.\nWith the clock seemingly ticking, here's what could happen next in the case.\n1) Trump secures a bond\nA panel of appeals court judges will decide by 25 March whether the $464m judgement can be paused while Mr Trump appeals.\nIn filings earlier this week, Mr Trump's lawyers said they had approached 30 bond companies without success, due to the \"massive\" size of the judgement.\nTo secure a bond, an individual must demonstrate to the company providing the guarantee that they have enough liquidity - usually in the form of cash plus stocks or securities which can be sold quickly - to cover the amount.\nThe bonding company would agree to pay the financial penalty if Mr Trump loses his appeal and cannot do so himself.\nIn a Truth Social post on Friday, Mr Trump said he had secured nearly enough funds for collateral.  Companies require slightly more than the judgement itself to put up a bond.\n\"Through hard work, talent, and luck, I currently have almost five hundred million dollars in cash,\" Mr Trump wrote, adding that he had hoped to use the money for his presidential campaign.\nThe former president testified last year that he had around $400m in liquid assets. He could have sold other assets or taken a personal loan to reach half a billion.\nPreviously, New York Attorney General Letitia James said his claims about not being able secure a bond were \"unreliable\", arguing he could always get several smaller bonds.\n2) Trump pays the penalty\nMr Trump could also use the $500m in cash he says he has to pay the judgement himself.\nBut he is much more likely to use as it as collateral, which is generally more cost-effective than paying the judgement outright, Mr Thomas said.\nMr Trump is seeking to overturn the judge's finding that he owes millions in potential lost interest by the banks that loaned him money, and from the profits of his sale of his New York golf course and Washington DC hotel.\nSome have suggested another source of funds for the fine or the bond: Trump Media, the company behind the Truth social media platform.\nIt is poised to become a publicly listed company and trade in the stock market. Mr Trump's stake is expected to be worth $3 bn.\nBut that avenue is almost entirely closed to him. He will be barred for six months from selling his stock and would need a waiver to use his shares as collateral, which is a difficult hurdle to clear.\n3) The option he may want to avoid: Bankruptcy\nHe could also declare bankruptcy, which would allow him to avoid paying the judgement.\nWhile many analysts have said this is the cleanest way out of a financial mess, it is the path he will be least inclined to take.\nBankruptcy could be costly. It is also a very public process that could damage Mr Trump's reputation as a financial titan in an election year.\n\"Practically, it's the most devastating thing that Donald Trump could ever do to his self image,\" Mr Thomas said.\nMr Trump has filed for bankruptcy for his businesses multiple times in the past, but never for himself.\n4) Trump gets a pause\nAn appeals court could side with the former president and allow him to hold off paying the judgement or posting bond while he appeals.\nThis would be a best-case scenario for the former president, who is no doubt eager to avoid having to pay an estimated 16% of what Forbes reports is his $2.6bn net worth.\nHowever, an appeals court is less likely to grant Mr Trump this relief now that he has admitted to having the cash necessary to secure a bond, experts said.\nRenato Mariotti, a lawyer who represents large real-estate developers, said it was hard to predict how the court would treat a former president.\n\"But my clients wouldn't get a pause,\" he said.\n5) A compromise option\nThe court still could come back to Mr Trump with a middle-of-the-road option, experts said, requiring Mr Trump to post a bond of a smaller amount while he appeals against the ruling.\nMr Trump, however, has already asked an appeals court to allow him to post a bond covering $100m instead and was turned down.\nUltimately, if Mr Trump doe",
    "A court has extended Indian opposition leader Arvind Kejriwal's custody until Monday in a corruption case.\nThe Delhi chief minister denies alleged irregularities in a now-scrapped alcohol sales policy in the capital.\nThe ruling comes a day after the US reiterated that it encouraged a \"fair\" legal process in the case.\nMr Kejriwal was arrested last week amid criticism from opposition parties that the government was stifling them ahead of general elections in April and May.\nHe was produced in court on Thursday, which had earlier been set as his last day in custody .\nMr Kejriwal told the court that the case against him was a \"political conspiracy\" and that there was no concrete evidence to back the claims against him.\nBut SV Raju, representing the Enforcement Directorate (ED), India's financial crimes unit, said that Mr Kejriwal had been \"evasive in his replies\".\nAfter the hearing, Mr Kejriwal's lawyer Ramesh Gupta told reporters that the chief minister had \"no objection to being in custody\" but that he \"opposed the grounds on which his remand is being sought\".\nMr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of political vendetta. The BJP denies the allegation, saying it is acting against corruption.\nMr Kejriwal is the third AAP leader to be arrested over the alleged corruption case. An alliance of more than 20 opposition parties have planned a protest rally in Delhi on Sunday against his arrest.\nThe BJP has alleged that the now-scrapped alcohol policy - which ended the government's monopoly on liquor sales - gave undue advantages to private retailers. The ED has accused AAP leaders of receiving kickbacks to be used in state elections. The party denies the allegation.\nOn Wednesday, US State Department spokesperson, Mathew Miller, reiterated that the US was closely following Mr Kejriwal's arrest and actions taken against opposition parties in India.\n\"We encourage fair, transparent, timely legal processes [in both cases]. We don't think anyone should object to that,\"  Mr Miller said.\nHe had made similar remarks on Tuesday, which prompted India to summon a senior US diplomat in Delhi to register its protest.\nIndia had criticised his remarks on Tuesday and issued a fresh statement on Thursday as well.\n\"The recent remarks are unwarranted. In India, legal processes are driven by the rule of law. Anyone who has similar ethos, specially fellow democracies, should have no difficulty in appreciating this fact,\" a spokesperson from India's Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday.\nThe US is the second country to comment on Mr Kejriwal's arrest. Last week, the German foreign ministry said it hoped that Mr Kejriwal would get a \"fair and impartial trial as India is a democratic nation\".\nIndia reacted strongly to these remarks as well and summoned a German diplomat to raise its objections.\nIndian opposition leaders have accused the BJP of using investigative agencies to cripple their parties and stifle dissent before the elections.\nHours before Mr Kejriwal's arrest on 21 March, India's main opposition Congress party also held a press conference saying that its bank accounts had been frozen by the tax department ahead of the general elections.\nIn January, the ED arrested top opposition leader Hemant Soren in a corruption case, hours after he resigned from the position of the chief minister of Jharkhand state. Mr Soren and his party denied any wrongdoing and accused the BJP of stifling opposition. The BJP has rejected his claim.\nAmnesty International has also said that the crackdown on peaceful dissent and opposition in India has \"now reached a crisis point\".\nRead more India stories from the BBC:",

    "From the first shout of \"fireball\" the crew of HMS Diamond have just two minutes to react. In that time they have to work out whether the missile, travelling at more than three times the speed of sound, poses a direct threat to their ship and nearby merchant vessels.\nWe were the first media on board HMS Diamond since she joined the US-led operation to protect merchant shipping in the Red Sea. We witnessed the threat first-hand as she prepared to run the gauntlet of Houthi drones and missiles being fired from Yemen.\nThe captain of HMS Diamond says the Houthis are now using more advanced and more lethal weapons.\nCdr Pete Evans says when the ship first entered the Red Sea in December, one-way attack drones, or UAVs, were the main threat. But he says the Houthis have \"moved much more into conventional and ballistic missiles which are harder to defend against and cause much more damage\".\nWe began our voyage as the crew made the final checks to the ship's weapons systems.\nIts main Sea Viper missiles were already primed, hidden in a silo at the front of the ship - with scorch marks still visible from previous launches. Each missile costs more than \u00c2\u00a31m ($1.3m). They are the ship's main line of defence. But Diamond also has Phalanx machine guns and 30mm cannons on each side of the ship - close-in weapons.\nThe Phalanx can fire more than 3,000 rounds a minute. For the very first time the crew have also used the 30mm cannon to successfully shoot down a drone.\nDiamond's main task in the Red Sea has been to protect merchant ships travelling through this key trade route. But for this mission she'd be escorting a naval task force of UK support ships sailing towards the Indian Ocean - with two US destroyers providing additional protection.\nUp on the bridge the navigator, Lt Josh Tyrie, showed the route we'd be taking - past Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, through the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait and out into the Gulf of Aden.\nThey call this the High Threat Area - where the Houthis have been focusing their attacks on both merchant shipping and coalition warships.\n\"There's a regular drumbeat of drones and missiles, so there's a good possibility that will happen,\" Lt Tyrie said.\nBy now the entire crew had changed from their blue uniforms to fire-resistant white overalls. We'd all been issued anti-flash hoods and gloves to wear in case the ship was hit.\nThe upper decks were declared out of bounds - with dim red lighting in the ship's passageways. Photos of Iranian-designed drones, which might be used against the vessel, are displayed along the decks.\nWe waited inside the operations room - the ship's nerve centre - where the crew stare into rows of monitors and screens. With the ship's powerful radar they can track multiple objects simultaneously for hundreds of miles.\nAt 20:35 came the first blast of a whistle with a shout of \"fireball\" - the code for a detected missile launch. The ship's alarm sounded to alert the rest of the crew with the words: \"Air threat warning red - missile inbound.\"\nAs they tracked the missile's flight path they issued updates. The air threat was lowered from red to yellow and then white. The tension eased and sailors removed their anti-flash hoods and gloves.\nIt was the first of four anti-ship ballistic missiles fired by the Houthis that night. Lt Cdr Martyn Harris, Diamond's executive officer, explained they had just two minutes to react to launches, with the missile travelling at more than three times the speed of sound.\n\"Yes it can feel a bit intense if someone is potentially trying to shoot something at you,\" he said.\nDiamond has been targeted by the Houthis in the past - but in this case the missiles did not pose a direct threat.\nTwo days later there's another \"fireball\" warning at 03:20. Once again the alarm is sounded, and the crew rush to their positions. This time too the missile flies out of range and splashes into the sea.\nHMS Diamond has not yet shot down any Houthi missiles. But it has destroyed nine Houthi drones - seven of them in just one night in January. Silhouettes of the nine drones are painted on the side of the ship's bridge. Diamond is the first Royal Navy warship to have shot down a threat from the air since 1991.\nThere's another tense moment on this escort mission, when they locate a signal from the ground to a number of Houthi drones. The UAVs are flying north of the task group. It's a deadly version of hide and seek. But the drones do not appear to spot them, and one is later shot down by a US warship further north.\nLeading hand Erin Graham knows what that's like. She was the ship's electronic warfare director on duty on 9 January. She describes it as a \"big swarm attack, which escalated very quickly\".\nThere were 18 drones in all. Six of them were taken out by Diamond's Sea Viper missiles and one was shot down by its 30mm cannon, operated remotely from the operations room.\nErin, 22, said \"you've just got to remain cool, calm and collected and go through the drills\".\nDia",

It's a constant battle.\"\nHe said: \"I've had colleagues who've had knives, machetes and even a shotgun pulled out and told they don't care the road is closed they're going down there regardless.\"\nJonathan Wade, senior project manager for National Highways responsible for the M25 junction 10 scheme, said: \"We have cameras, which can pick people up if they're in some way abusing the workforce.\n\"A motorist threw a road traffic cone at one of our guys, the driver was trying to pass through an area that was closed and he didn't like it.\"\nRoad workers in Southampton were recently given body cameras and more mobile CCTV cameras after a rise in abuse from drivers.\nBrenton McClean, a Balfour Beatty supervisor from the city, told the BBC that the \"scariest experience\" of his career was when he claimed a farmer pointed a shot gun at him while he was working near Stonehenge in Wiltshire.\nHe said he had also experienced racial abuse and once had to restrain a man who attacked his colleague with a baseball bat.\nIn February, Wokingham Borough Council claimed a driver had intentionally hit a road worker in Finchampstead, Berkshire with their vehicle before fleeing the scene.\nAt the same junction, the council said motorists had threatened to stab and punch workers.\nOxfordshire County Council said some workers in the county had been \"confronted with a knife, racially abused, physically manhandled and even threatened with shooting\".\nA driver threatened to use an electric handsaw unless he was allowed through a closed road in Birmingham, while others had made threats with a crossbows and dogs.\nSteven Day, South East operations manager for Go Traffic Management, a company that installs lane and road closures, said he had spent 12 years on the roads but now has opted for a desk job.\n\"I had one quite severe incident where a member of the public was threatening to kill me, he was trying to open my van door, he wanted to get me out of the van.  Mentally I don't want to return to that site,\" Mr Day said.\n\"It grinds you down and deflates you and you normalise abuse. It's not right and we should be addressing it.\"\nOffences committed at road works are not limited to abusing workers.\nCh Insp Steve O'Keefe, head of roads policing covering Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, said: \"Lane incursions, where people ignore road signs and directions drive through road closures or partial lane closures, have literally caused roadworkers to dive for safety and is so dangerous.\n\"There is really no place to hide. You will be detected and traced to your vehicle, if you are not arrested at the scene,\" he said.\nFigures released by National Highways suggest over 7,200 reports of incursions have reported in the last three years.\nThese include cases where vehicles enter the road works or breach rolling roadblocks.\nA number of companies and local authorities are backing the Stamp It Out Campaign , which is calling for a simpler incident reporting system and more public education.\nThe campaign group says more than 2,000 reports of abuse towards staff were recorded in 2023.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

    "Ukraine says it has hit two landing ships, a communications centre and other infrastructure used by Russia's Black Sea fleet off annexed Crimea.\nAn announcement by the Ukrainian general staff said the Yamal and Azov ships had been destroyed.\nThe Russian-installed governor of the port of Sevastopol said 10 Ukrainian missiles had been shot down.\nRussia also launched a missile and drone attack on the capital, Kyiv, and the region of Lviv early on Sunday.\nIn an announcement, Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Russian-appointed mayor of Sevastopol, said damage had been caused to residential buildings and transport infrastructure as a result of the \"massive\" attack.\nHe asked residents not to publish information or any images.\nUK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps praised the attack on the Russian ships, calling it a \"historic moment for Ukraine\".\n\"In plain English, it means that Putin can no longer exercise safely in the Black Sea, even though the Russian Fleet has operated there since 1783,\" Mr Shapps said.\nHe added that the world \"cannot afford\" for Ukraine to lose this war, and that the UK's support for Kyiv in the face of Russian assaults \"will remain undimmed\".\nThe BBC has not been able to verify the Ukrainian claim to have damaged the Russian landing ships, which are used to land troops and equipment straight to shore without the need for a pier or dock.\nOn Sunday morning, Kyiv residents took shelter in metro stations as the attack began at 05:00 (03:00 GMT).\nOfficials said their defences had shot down 18 Russian missiles and 25 drones there. There was only minor damage.\nAbout 20 Russian missiles and seven drones targeted \"critical infrastructure\" in the western region of Lviv. No damage has been reported.\nOne of the cruise missiles entered the airspace of neighbouring Poland, a Nato member, the armed forces announced.\n\"The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow and stayed there for 39 seconds. During the entire flight, it was observed by military radar systems,\" the armed forces said in a statement.\n\"If there was any premise indicating that this object was going in the direction of any targets located in Poland, of course, it would have been shot down and more adequate measures would have been taken,\" Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said.\nRussia annexed Crimea in 2014 and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nThere has been an increase in aerial attacks by both sides in the past few days, even as Russia makes slow progress in taking some territory in the east of the country.\nOn Friday, Russia fired dozens of missiles at Ukraine, hitting a dam and leaving a million Ukrainians without power.\nAnd Ukraine has been hitting targets in Crimea more regularly.\nIn particular, Ukraine has repeatedly hit the Black Sea fleet  - seen as the best of Russia's navy. Satellite images last year showed many of the Crimea-based warships had left the peninsula for the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk.\nLast month, the Russian landing ship Caesar Kunikov was sunk off the coast of Crimea, according to Ukraine's armed forces.\nIts sister ship Novocherkassk was hit while in port in Feodosiya in December last year.\nIn one of the biggest strikes on the Black Sea fleet, last September Ukraine attacked naval targets and port infrastructure, using as many as 10 missiles and three unmanned boats. It caused a large fire at a Sevastopol shipyard.\nUkraine's biggest scalp in naval warfare has so far been the sinking of Russia's flagship Black Sea missile cruiser, the Moskva, in April 2022.\nUkraine has also targeted the Kerch bridge several times, as it is an important resupply route for Russian forces occupying parts of the country's south.\nKyiv has repeatedly said it plans to retake Crimea and all territories seized by Russia.\nUkraine is critically dependent on weapons supplies from the US and other Western allies to keep fighting Russia - a much bigger military force with an abundance of arms and artillery.\nAs well as being a platform from which to attack Ukraine, the Black Sea fleet is a major symbol of Russia's centuries-old military presence in the region.\nIt was based in Crimea under a leasing deal, even before Russia illegally annexed the peninsula.\nPresident Vladimir Putin has said that Russia had to take control of Crimea to stop it from falling into Western hands.",

    "Actress Rebel Wilson and Borat and Ali G creator Sacha Baron Cohen have become involved in a dispute over her plans to publish what he has described as \"demonstrably false claims\" about him.\nWilson has said her forthcoming memoir has a chapter dedicated to Baron Cohen.\nShe has not given details of what is in it, but has said she would not be \"bullied or silenced\" by his lawyers.\nHis spokesperson said her claims would be \"directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence\".\nThe pair starred in Baron Cohen's 2016 film Grimsby, which was known as The Brothers Grimsby in North America.\nThe Australian actress played Dawn, the girlfriend of Baron Cohen's character Nobby, a football fan who gets drawn into the world of his super-spy brother.\nEarlier this month, Wilson said in an Instagram video that her book would include details of when she worked with someone who she described using an expletive.\nShe has now named the subject of that chapter as Baron Cohen, and wrote: \"I will not be bullied or silenced by high priced lawyers of PR crisis managers.\"\nShe hasn't given further details. Her book is due to be published in the US on 2 April.\nIn response, Baron Cohen's spokesperson told BBC News: \"While we appreciate the importance of speaking out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage, and eyewitness accounts from those present before, during and after the production of The Brothers Grimsby.\"\nThe British star made his name with a brazen brand of comedy, including audacious pranks carried out while disguised as spoof gangster Ali G or fake Kazakh journalist Borat.\nWilson has previously described his personality and style on the Grimsby set as \"completely outrageous\", recounting how he had repeatedly tried to persuade her to film nude scenes, and saying a sex scene between them was \"just the most disgusting thing ever\".\nSpeaking in 2014, she said: \"He just keeps pushing you and pushing you and pushing the comedy in every single scene, which is why his stuff is so out loud funny.\"\nWhen her book Rebel Rising was announced last year, Wilson said the book was \"like me sitting down telling my deepest, darkest secrets to a friend\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 with some laughs along the way of course\".\nSarah Emsley of its UK publishers HarperCollins said it was \"bursting with the honesty, intelligence, humour and kick-ass spirit that I was hoping for\".\nShe added: \"As well as being an actress, comedian and director, Rebel is also an incredibly astute businesswoman and it was clear from the outset that she knows exactly what needs to be done to drive her book to the top of the bestseller lists across the globe.\"",
    "A man who carried out a \"horrific\" chainsaw attack in Lincoln, leaving his victim with serious injuries, has been jailed for five years.\nAndrew Roberts, 30, admitted wielding the electric machine and hurting the man in Winn Street, on 13 March 2023.\nLincoln Crown Court heard the 10cm wound to his back narrowly missed the victim's spine but he has been left with physical and mental scars.\nThe assault happened following an altercation with a group of men.\nProsecutor Jeremy Janes said the self-employed painter and decorator was walking home from the Birdcage pub when he became involved in the altercation.\nThere was no grudge between the victim and the men but at some point he was stabbed by an unidentified attacker. As he tried to crawl away from the front door of a property on Winn Street, he was attacked by Roberts, who was an old school colleague, Mr Janes said.\n\"At this point he (the victim) felt the chainsaw cutting into his back and he heard the the chainsaw revving,\" the prosecutor said.\nThe father-of-three was found by police walking in a nearby street without his top and covered in blood, the court heard.\nRoberts was arrested in nearby Lytton Street after officers found the chainsaw, which contained traces of the victim's blood, hidden under a bunk bed at an address in Winn Street where they noticed blood outside the property.\nPolice said the victim was treated in hospital for lacerations to different parts of his body.\nRoberts, of Lytton Street, Lincoln, pleaded guilty to a charge of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.\n'Horrific incident'\nHis defence barrister, Anna Soubry said Roberts' problems came from his previous use of illegal drugs.\n\"His memory of that evening is fuzzy because of the amount of illegal drugs he took,\" she said.\nDet Con Liam Henderson for the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Lincoln said: \"This was a horrific incident whereby the victim received horrendous injuries, for which he will bear scars for the rest of his life.\"\n\"I hope today's result brings the victim some form of closure and I am pleased that we were able to bring the offender to justice,\" he added.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) , and Instagram .

    "Russian state media is firmly blaming Ukraine and the West for the deadly attack on the Crocus City Hall, echoing similar narratives by the Kremlin while ignoring Ukraine's denial of any involvement.\nThose commentators who are more independent-minded are sceptical of such claims, however, arguing that state security has been distracted by the war in Ukraine and dropped the ball in preventing this attack at home.\nThe most startling effort at disinformation by Russian state media is perhaps NTV's broadcast of a video with seemingly AI-generated audio of Ukraine's top security official Oleksiy Danilov. The clip aired on Russia's third most-popular channel, just hours after the attack.\nIt purported to show Danilov saying, \"It is fun in Moscow today\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I would like to believe that we will arrange such fun for them more often.\"\nBut we have established that the video clip is a composite of two different interviews published in the last week, and that the voice in the video was probably generated using AI technology.\n'ISIS nowhere near there'\nRussian TV presenters and popular pro-Kremlin bloggers have questioned whether the Islamic State group (IS) was behind the Moscow attack, calling this the \"Western version\" of events.\n\"There are already attempts to have everyone chasing down the wrong lead,\" popular commentator and pro-Kremlin propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov said during his 24 March prime-time news review programme.\n\"IS has different hallmarks. Acts of terror in the name of IS are perpetrated by suicide attackers who do not try to flee afterwards,\" he added, claiming:\n\"It is an indisputable fact that the terrorists sought salvation in Ukraine, which is where they headed after committing the crime.\"\nThese comments come despite the fact that the Islamic State group (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack. The group has also published footage from the attackers' points of view, video that the BBC has been able to verify.\n\"It is unclear why this bloodless group of radical Islamists decided to carry out this attack. The explanations of American experts seem forced, as if tailoring a solution to a ready-made answer,\" state-controlled Channel One asserted.\nMargarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the state broadcaster RT (Russia Today) also made similar assertions .\n\"'There were no 'shahid belts' [explosive belts] on the ghouls... None of them were going to die. None of them were religious fanatics. ISIS was nowhere near there,\" she said on Telegram.\nBritish 'professionals' in 'inciting ethnic conflict'\nThere have also been numerous attempts to blame Ukraine and Western powers for the attack.\nSome newspapers, like state-owned Rossiyskaya Gazeta, claim the attackers' weapons, in yellow-green camouflage colours, \"are very similar to the weapons that traitors from the Russian Volunteer Corps use\" . The group is a pro-Russian formation fighting on the side of Ukraine.\nSome commentators made even more outlandish claims.\nCommunist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, for example, told the rolling news channel Rossiya 24 TV: \"Unfortunately, many of our citizens have not fully realised that the Anglo-Saxons, Nato members are simply waging a war of destruction on the Russian world.\"\n\"This wild, absolutely disgusting barbaric terrorist attack is eloquent evidence of this,\" he said, before going on to assert a conspiracy theory that the US was behind the 9/11 attack.\nState Rossiya 1 reporter Andrei Medvedev saw the hand of MI6 , which, according to him, \"patronises the Ukrainian HUR\" (Main Intelligence Directorate) and \"chose precisely migrants to carry out a monstrous terrorist attack\".\n\"The British, due to their long colonial past, are very serious professionals in the field of inciting ethnic conflicts,\" he wrote in a post on the popular platform Telegram, that garnered almost 900,000 views.\nIndependent commentators however, have highlighted numerous discrepancies in the narratives blaming Ukraine - that the arrests took place near the border with Belarus and not Ukraine, for example.\nPutin 'bears direct responsibility'\nHowever, Novaya Gazeta Europe's editor, Kirill Martynov, has said: \" Russian propaganda is currently desperately seeking ways to link the terrorist attack in Moscow to Ukraine.\"\nLike many of the paper's writers, Martynov is now based in Latvia having left Russia after a crackdown on independent media following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\"It is already clear that the tragedy became possible due to the colossal failure of Russian counter-terrorism agencies, which in recent years have been busy with anything but their direct duties,\" he says.\n\"Russians remember the semi-conspiratorial theories about terrorist attacks from 25 years ago when [President Vladimir] Putin came to power under the slogan of fighting terrorists.\n\"The Russian dictator bears direct responsibility for the fact that, having unleashed a war with Russia's neighbours in 2014 and 2022, he now has no resources left to protect the country's citizens from re",
    "He won power by promising to end corruption - but try telling that to the people who want him to just hand out jobs.\n\"A lot of people come into government believing they are there to enrich themselves,\" says Liberia's President Joseph Boakai.\n\"They don't understand what public service is about.\"\nIn the three months since he defeated President George Weah and took the reins, Mr Boakai says he has been \"very selective\" about who he brings along with him because he blames corruption '\"for all the crises we've had\".\nThe 79-year-old is a former prime minister but does not hail from a political dynasty.\n\"I never really had a childhood,\" he tells BBC Africa Daily in a wide-ranging interview . \"My ambition was just to live a normal life\".\nAs one of five sons born to a disabled, poor mother and an absent father, he went on to work as a school janitor and rubber tapper.\nIt was gruelling work - causing him pain because he didn't realise he was meant to carry rubber on his shoulders instead of his head - but it gave him the grit a politician needs, he tells the BBC.\nThose early jobs paid for two pairs of smart trousers, two shirts and a one-way ticket to the capital city of Monrovia.\nAfter gaining a place at the city's College of West Africa, he could only see his mother one week each year as he had to work within the college to pay for his tuition and upkeep.\nNow approaching his 80s, Mr Boakai acknowledges he's the age of most of the electorate's grandparents - but sees his role as rooting out deep-seated problems and handing over a well-managed Liberia to the next generation.\n\"I am here only to guide a process to bring this country to where it should be and then they can take it over.\"\nSo how successful has he been so far?\n\"Liberians have heard this all before - where a head of state comes in and makes these large, far-ranging proclamations about the fact they're going to make corruption public enemy number-one,\" says author and activist Robtel Neajai Pailey.\nHowever, she adds, President Boakai declared his own assets as soon as he came in and made his appointees do the same. Mr Boakai has also asked for an audit of the presidential office, and beefed up integrity institutions such as the General Auditing Commission and the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission.\n\"This is a way of signalling to the Liberian people that it won't be business as usual,\" says Dr Neajai Pailey, \"and now members of the judiciary and legislature are following suit\".\nThere is still a long way to go.\nLiberians have lost patience over recent years and mounted mass protests - accusing the previous government of mismanaging funds and corruption while the cost of living has spiralled for normal people.\nMore than a fifth of the population lives on less than $2.15 (\u00c2\u00a31.70) a day.\nLast year, when Mr Weah was still at the helm, Liberia was ranked 145th out of 180 countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.\nThe ex-footballer's time in office saw a number of scandals, with three government officials sanctioned by the US Treasury and subsequently resigning - they have still not been prosecuted.\nPresident Boakai too has his critics.\nA judge recently accused Mr Boakai of cronyism - claiming he favouring people from his home area of Lofa County for top jobs. The presidency tells the BBC this is not true.\n\"The president is not appointing based on tribe - he is putting competence above anything else,\" says presidential press secretary Kula Fofana. Pressed to confirm how many officials were appointed from the president's native Lofa, he declined to say, \"because we are not appointing by counties\".\n'We can feed the world'\nWith his past on Liberia's rubber plantations and a stint in the 1980s as agricultural minister, President Boakai sees huge growth opportunities in the county's soil.\n\"In Africa, we're not going to manufacture new aircraft or new automobiles but we can feed the world,\" he tells BBC Africa Daily.\n\"We have the water, we have the soil, we have the land. We don't need to import the amount of rice we're importing. We can feed ourselves if we cut down corruption and use our resources properly - we can feed ourselves and even export.\"\nHe also campaigned on a pledge to improve Liberia's sorry road network.\n\"Based on my own experience, year after year, cars are stuck in the mud, people can't move,\" he says. \"You know the impact that has on health, education, on people's movement and the prices of goods.\n\"So what I've said is that in at least the first 100 days we should be able to make all vehicles move on our roads\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That's what I said and that's what I'm working on.\"\nHe has his work cut out for him, he knows, but still finds some moments to relax.\n\"I never have time for too much fun but I love all kinds of music - jazz, African music, and I'm a lover of sport.\n\"I'm an Arsenal fan - I've been to the Emirates twice and I get all their souvenirs!\"\nAdditional reporting by Moses Kollie Garzeawu\nMore Liberia stories from the BBC:",

    "Pictures of two of the suspects accused of killing 137 people in an attack on a concert near Moscow make the front page of the Guardian . The paper says Russia's investigative committee released a video yesterday showing the men being led blindfolded into its headquarters.\nThe Daily Mail says footage was also circulating of the suspects being tortured by what it calls their \"sadistic\" captors. According to the Daily Telegraph , one appears to have been hooked up to electric wires.\nThe Sun is among those to report that Britain will officially blame China for a cyber-attack in 2021. The hackers targeted the Electoral Commission, accessing the personal details of 40 million people in the UK, it says. There are also fears for the NHS, because government sources have told the Sun that the health service uses the same software that was accessed.\nAccording to the Times , the Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, will tell MPs that as a result of the findings, the UK will look at sanctioning Chinese officials implicated in human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.\nChina also makes the front page of the Daily Telegraph because Whitehall sources believe Beijing, Russia and Iran are fuelling disinformation about Catherine, the Princess of Wales. Senior government figures fear the countries are behind the spread of \"wild conspiracy theories\" about her health. \"Part of the modus operandi of hostile states is to destabilise things\", a government source is quoted as saying.\nThe Daily Express reports that King Charles III will rally the nation with a powerful Easter message this week. The paper says he will seek to \"provide reassurance\" to people after Catherine publicly announced she was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer on Friday. The King - who also has cancer - is according to the Daily Mail \"so optimistic\" about his own treatment he has expressed a hope to attend Royal Ascot this summer.\nThe Daily Mirror leads on what it calls the \"battle for the boozer\" , with some pubs now closing at 20:00 due to costs and a lack of customers. Greg Kirk, the landlord of The Hawke in east London, says he does not open at all on Mondays and Tuesdays. The Campaign for Real Ale has described the revelations in the Mirror as a \"harsh wake up call\" for the government.

Figures from HM Revenue and Customs show the number of people in that category is 830, up from 650 before the pandemic.

    "Haiti is a state out of action.\nMore than two weeks after the country's prime minister resigned, following a surge of violence in Port-au-Prince, details of a presidential transitional council have still not been revealed.\nOne of the challenges this council will have to face is the illegal trafficking of guns, which has powered the gangs which have taken over.\nThe escalation in violence has sparked an exodus from the capital.\nAmong those leaving is 14-year-old David Charles whose father Israel is nervous with excitement as he waits for his son's bus to arrive in Cap-Haitien.\nA coach with boarded-up windows pulls up to the side of the road. He smiles in anticipation. His 14-year-old son David soon walks down the stairs with his luggage. They embrace tightly.\nDavid has managed to escape Port-au-Prince - a city now torn apart by armed gangs and political chaos. Most of the violence gripping Haiti is centred in the capital: the UN estimates 80% of it is now controlled by gangs.\nHe had been living there for two years without his parents, in order to finish his education, but Israel did not want him \"to become a victim\".\nThis month's torrent of violence spurred him to get his son out to Cap-Haitien, a city in the north of the country which is safer.\n\"The journey was very long, more than six hours. I was praying the whole way,\" says David. \"The bus driver later told us there were a lot of gunshots in one area, our bus just missed them.\"\nOther passengers on the bus look exhausted, relieved but also upset. One man in a dark T-shirt and sunglasses speaks quietly as we ask him how he is. But becomes visibly angry as he tells us he has a message for the United States.\n\"All the guns here are from the US, everybody knows it. If the US wants to stop this, they could easily do it one month!\" He pleads: \"We are asking the US to give us a chance to live, just give us a chance.\"\nFor a country that does not manufacture weapons, a UN report in January found every type of gun was flooding Port-au-Prince: high-powered rifles such as AK-47s, 9mm pistols, sniper rifles and machine guns.\nThe weapons are fuelling the staggering surge in Haiti's gang-related violence.\nThere is no exact number for how many trafficked firearms are currently in Haiti.\nThe UN report said some estimates put it at half a million legal and illegal weapons here as of 2020.\nIt reported that guns and ammunition were being smuggled in from land, air and sea from US states such as Florida, Texas and Georgia.\nThere have been seizures in the country's main ports in Port-au-Prince, Port-de-Paix and in Cap-Haitien. Illegal weapons are hidden in shipping containers among toy and clothes donations.\nIn July 2022, Haitian authorities seized a huge haul of dozens of weapons with 15,000 rounds of ammunition. They were stuffed in a shipment from Florida heading to an Episcopal church in Haiti.\nThe UN also identified the use of several clandestine airstrips built for humanitarian purposes after the devastating earthquake in 2010, which are now hardly monitored.\nEarlier this month, a UN spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, told journalists the UN Secretary-General's message to gangs in Haiti was to \"silence the guns\".\nIn the corner of his office, Cap-Haitien's chief prosecutor, Charles-Edward Durant, keeps a semi-automatic weapon.\nHe says he needs security whenever he travels. For him, things have never been so bad in Haiti. \"This is a nightmare, a horrible dream. I would like Haitians to wake up and work to have a better country.\"\nIs he worried that with guns being so prolific, the violence could make its way into Cap-Haitien?\nAt this, he smiles with more confidence: \"We are resisting, we have our ways: informants, checkpoints. Are they afraid of us? Of course. We are not playing. Anything can happen. If a gangster comes, he's not here to play, and so we aren't playing with them either.\"\nThe US says it will throw its weight at the problem of guns and gangs, too.\nLast year, the State Department indicated it had plans to help establish a new policing unit in Haiti to address weapons being trafficked into the country.\nBarbara Feinstein, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Caribbean Affairs and Haiti, said at the time it was only \"one piece of the equation\".\nHowever, with no head of state, and effectively no government, Haiti's people are trapped in yet another vicious circle of violence powered by illegal guns.\nOne of them is Juliette Dorson. The 50-year-old fled Port-au-Prince after surviving a shooting.\nThe party planner still bears the scars from the bullets which hit her when she was ambushed at an event she was catering for.\n\"I said run, run, run because they are shooting. At that moment, I was shot twice: once in my feet and the other in the arm.\"\nTen people were killed, including her 22-year-old business partner, Luc.\nShe sobs as she speaks about him. The memory of it all is too traumatic to talk about at length.\nJuliette shows us the small space she currently lives in,",

We don't have evidence to prove why it happened.\"\n'Unbearable loss'\nIn their statement, Mr Singh's family said: \"Today a mother will grow old without her son. A sister will grow up without her brother. We don't want what has happened to us to happen to another family.\n\"It is an unbearable loss for us which has changed our lives. My daughter and myself will be living our lives for the sake of it but our happiness and the will to live is not there.\"\nDet Ch Ins Mark Bellamy, who led the murder investigation, said that despite none of the men having links with Shrewsbury, Mr Singh's murder had had significant local impact.\n\"Today's verdict should send a strong message to those who think they can come into our towns and cities to commit violent crime that we will not stop in our efforts to find them and put them before the courts,\" he said.\n\"This was a complex investigation which saw us work with police forces across the country and I'd like to thank the investigation team and those involved for their hard work and commitment.\"",

although it was announced on Wednesday that they would have all their rates payments refunded.\nAn emergency general meeting of residents was held on Wednesday night.\nFrancis McAuley, who was at the meeting, said afterwards that it was an emotional discussion and that he backed further legal proceedings to attempt to get compensation.\n\"Barristers don't come cheap, but the residents have no choice at this point,\" he said.\n\"Do you walk away from your apartment or do you fight with every last bit to try to salvage what are the best apartments in Belfast?\"\nAn interim report on the structural failures claimed a column was \"constructed using concrete that was understrength by some 75%\".\nThe findings suggest a dozen other columns are also understrength, although to a lesser degree.\nThe authors said the failings posed \"a serious health and safety issue\", but stressed the need for further tests.\nThe companies involved in construction and fitting out of the apartments deny liability.\nThe report by engineering and architect firm William J Marshall and Partners in conjunction with the testing and consultancy company Sandberg LLP, was commissioned by owners of the apartments at the city centre property.\nBBC News NI has seen the interim views of the authors.\n'Substantial structural failure'\nNinety-one properties were evacuated five years ago as a result of the safety concerns , after cracks started appearing in the walls in what was described as \"a serious and substantial structural failure\" of a column.\nResidents of the building have been paying rates since, but Land & Property Services (LPS) has now announced owners will no longer be liable.\nThe total amount to be refunded is \u00c2\u00a3170,000.\nOwners had their bid for compensation struck out by the High Court earlier this month.\nThe evidence presented as part of that case has allowed LPS officials to determine the properties can be removed from the Valuation List.\nIt has also been confirmed that any arrears will be written off.\nThis amounts to \u00c2\u00a3396,000 in unpaid rates.\nLegal action for the non payment of rates in the past has now been permanently suspended .\nWhat happened at Victoria Square?\nFinance Minister Caoimhe Archibald told BBC News NI it had been a complex case.\n\"This has been a really difficult situation for the owners of the apartments who have found themselves in a situation that's not of their making, and they've faced significant turmoil over the past number of years,\" she told Evening Extra.\n\"I have been determined to find a way forward in relation to the issue of rates... and officials in LPS have also been working hard to find a resolution for the owners.\"\nThe decision today is just related to the Victoria Square apartments and has no impact on any other properties in Northern Ireland.\nIn Northern Ireland claims for compensation where a building is found to be defective must be made within six years of a building being completed.\nThere have been calls for new legislation to bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales, where owners of properties have 30 years to make a claim.\nThe recent High Court decision also means the interim findings on the structural failings will not be tested in court.\nLiability denied\nThe building of the apartments was a joint venture by building companies Farrans and Gilbert Ash, with Farrans responsible for the \"construction obligations\" and Gilbert Ash in charge of fitting out the apartments.\nThey deny liability for the failings.\nIn response to specific questions about the concrete used in the development, Farrans said: \"We won't be commenting.\"\nIn a statement, Gilbert Ash said it \"carried out only internal fit-out works\" at the development.\n\"This included internal finishes, joinery, supply and installation of bathroom suites and kitchens as well as electrical and mechanical work for the apartments,\" they said.\n\"It did not include any structural work, including the construction of structural columns or the supply of concrete for those columns.\"\nThe authors of the report say too much water and too little cement was used in the mix for some of the concrete at the site.\nThe report also found the column which splintered at Victoria Square had been further weakened by a defective repair.\nThey believe bonding plaster was used instead of concrete to fix that column, which they suggest was a \"key factor\" in its \"failure\".\nFarrans and Gilbert Ash said they did not carry out the defective repair and the report concludes it is not possible to say when the work was done nor who was responsible for it.\nColumn testing\nOnly a limited number of columns were examined and the authors recommend concrete strength testing should be extended to al",
    "The Scottish government is facing calls to explain the sacking of the head of the company building two hugely delayed and over-budget CalMac ferries.\nFerguson Marine announced on Tuesday it had terminated the contract of chief executive David Tydeman.\nThe reasons for his departure were not revealed but it is understood it was over concerns about his performance.\nThe Scottish Conservatives have called on Economy Secretary Mairi McAllan to explain the decision at Holyrood.\nGraham Simpson, the party's shadow transport minister, said Mr Tydeman was \"widely respected\" and \"appeared to be delivering\".\nMr Simpson has tabled an urgent question to the Scottish Parliament in an attempt to force the cabinet secretary to provide an explanation for the decision.\nThe cost of two ferries being built at the state-owned shipyard, the Glen Sannox and Glen Rosa, is running at nearly four times the initial \u00c2\u00a397m cost. They will also be delivered six years late.\nMr Tydeman joined the Port Glasgow shipyard in 2022, having previously run a yacht-building company.\nOn Tuesday Ms McAllan said it was \"unacceptable\" that he had intimated a further delay to delivery of the Glen Sannox was \"likely\". The vessel was supposed to be delivered in May.\nThe Glen Rosa is scheduled to be delivered \"no later than\" September 2025.\nMr Tydeman had recently attempted to highlight progress on the Glen Sannox, praising its performance in sea trials earlier this year.\n\"What Mairi McAllan has to do today is come to Parliament and tell us exactly what these performance issues are,\" Mr Simpson told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme.\n\"It is not acceptable to sack someone who is widely respected in the industry and not say what the issue is.\"\nScottish Labour have also said the \"sudden overhaul\" in senior personnel \"raises serious questions and the public deserve transparency about what has happened\".\n'Paid the price'\nMr Tydeman's contract was terminated by Ferguson Marine amid a number of changes among the company's senior management.\nBoard chairman Andrew Miller said the shipyard needed \"strong leadership to ensure its long-term future\".\nJohn McMunagle, co-convenor of the GMB union which represents workers at the yard, said they were \"shocked and surprised\" at Mr Tydeman's departure.\n\"David inherited an almost impossible job,\" Mr McMunagle told the BBC. \"Arguably out of six or seven CEOs we have had, David has been the best of them.\n\"It is hard. David was probably optimistic in putting out dates that maybe weren't achievable and I think he has paid the price of that.\"\nMr McMunagle said the workforce nevertheless welcomed the appointment of non-executive director John Petticrew as interim CEO.\n\"John's obviously a shipyard man,\" he added. \"He served his time in the local Greenock shipyard before moving to Canada. We met with him yesterday and we are going to throw our weight behind John and fully support him.\n\"With Glen Rosa going into the water on 9 April and Glen Sannox leaving for dry dock, it is going to leave us acutely short of work. We need to source some short-term work to keep this workforce busy.\"\nFerguson Marine's former owner, Jim McColl, told the BBC it was \"appalling\" that Mr Tydeman had been dismissed and that he \"had no chance at all\".\nMr McColl rescued the last civilian shipyard on the River Clyde from administration in 2014 and agreed the initial contract in 2015 to build the two ferries for CMAL - the government agency which owns and procures ships for CalMac.\nHe blamed \"fundamental shortcomings in the specification\" at the outset and constant design changes for the subsequent fiasco.\n\"David Tydeman is not the problem,\" Mr McColl said. \"The fantastic workforce are not the problem. CalMac are not the problem. It is the design of the ferries and the incompetence of CMAL in this whole process.\"\nConstruction of the two vessels, the first ships ever built by a UK shipyard capable of running on liquefied natural gas (LNG), has been plagued by design challenges since the order was placed in 2015.\nSteel fabrication outpaced detailed design work, leading to errors and reworking, with repeated delays and cost increases that continued after the Port Glasgow yard fell back into administration and was nationalised in 2019.\nIn February, Mr Miller told MSPs it would be harder to return the business to the private sector without investment in a new automated plating line - with the company seeking further finance from the Scottish government.\nThe company is due to submit a new business case to ministers by the end of March.\nIn 2022, a number of Ferguson Marine workers who took part in an informal meeting with MSPs praised Mr Tydeman's leadership and compared him favourably to the shipyard's previous management,  saying he \"talked sense\".",
    "Landmarks across London will be switching their lights off for an hour on Saturday night as part of an environmental awareness campaign.\nThe annual Earth Hour, spearheaded by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), is observed around the world.\nPrevious years have seen Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower, and the Sydney Opera House turn out the lights.\nThe WWF suggests individuals use the 60 minutes, between 20:30 and 21:30, \"to do something positive for the planet\".\nLit-up landmarks that will go dark for the hour include the Barbican Arts Centre, the Old Bailey, Tower Bridge, and the OXO Tower.\nIdeas put forward by the organisation include signing a petition, sharing energy-saving tips or supporting wildlife.\nAccording to a survey commissioned by the WWF, 70% of people think it is still possible to avoid the worst effects of climate change and 76% think businesses and governments can have a large impact on tackling the crisis.\nIt comes after the WWF published its 2024 manifesto earlier this month, calling on MPs to take urgent political action on biodiversity loss and the environment.\nThe charity also started a petition urging political leaders to stop fuelling the destruction of nature.\nThe UK government has committed to urgent international action to tackle climate change.\nThe Climate Change Act says the UK must ensure the country's net carbon account for the year 2050 is net zero - at least 100% lower than the 1990 baseline.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Russia has shut down a panel of UN experts that have for years monitored sanctions against North Korea.\nThe panel last week said it was probing reports that Russia violated rules by buying North Korean weapons like ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine.\nThe UN's Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions on Pyongyang since 2006 for its nuclear weapons programme.\nThose restrictions are still in force - but the experts group set up to monitor violations will now be disbanded.\nIn a Security Council vote on Thursday, Russia used its veto power as a permanent member to block the renewal, while 13 of the other 14 member states present voted for it. China, Pyongyang's closest ally, abstained.\nRussia's block triggered a wave of condemnation from the US, UK, South Korea and other Western allies and comes after a year of high-profile public meetings between Moscow and Pyongyang leaders.\nThis is the first time Russia has blocked the panel - which has been renewed annually by the UN Security Council for 14 years.\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on social media Russia's veto was tantamount to \"a guilty plea\" that it was using North Korean weapons in the war.\nThe US, UK and France all told the Council that Russia was silencing the watchdog because it had begun to report on Moscow's own violations of the rules- specifically purchasing weapons from North Korea for the battlegrounds in Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, South Korea's representative at the UN criticised Russia's \"blind self-centeredness\" and said it had no justification \"for disbanding the guardians\" of the sanctions regime.\n\"This is almost comparable to destroying a CCTV to avoid being caught red-handed,\" Ambassador Hwang Joon-kook said.\nRussia has consistently denied using North Korean weapons and its representative at the UN again dismissed the accusations on Thursday.\nVasily Nebenzia also argued that the panel of experts had no added value.\n\"The panel has continued to focus on trivial matters that are not commensurate with the problems facing the peninsula,\" said Mr Nebenzia, who also added that sanctions had imposed a \"heavy burden\" on the North Korean people.\nSince 2019, Russia and China have sought to persuade the Security Council to ease sanctions.\nThe Security Council first imposed sanctions in 2006 in response to a North Korean nuclear test, and has since passed 10 more resolutions strengthening them as Pyongyang's nuclear activity has continued.\nHowever Kim Jong Un's regime has largely ignored the sanctions- despite their impact on the economy. The North Korean leader has rapidly continued nuclear weapons development and has pursued a more aggressive and dangerous military strategy in recent years.\nThe UN experts say North Korea continues to flout sanctions through increased missile test launches and developing nuclear weapons. The regime launched a spy satellite this year - with technology believed to have been provided by Russia.\nIn breach of the sanctions, it also continues to import refined petroleum products and send workers overseas, and the UN panel's most recent report detailed a campaign of cyber attacks.",
    "Twin ring-tailed lemurs, which are critically endangered, have been born at a Bridlington park.\nOwners of Bridlington Animal Park said Tuesday's births were the first of its kind at the Carnaby Covert Lane site.\nCurator and director Paul Woodward said it was a \"very special\" moment.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified the animals as \"critically endangered\".\nMr Woodward said the twins' arrival had come as a surprise as they were not expecting more than one baby.\n\"We were made up and gobsmacked all in one really.\n\"We were expecting one baby, not two and not a month early. So it's a big deal for us.\n\"It's fantastic and we've got double the joy.\"\nHe said the infant pair would be named as soon as their genders had been identified.\nThe creatures were born to 12-year-old Karan, who is the oldest of eight lemurs at the park. She has  been at the site since 2020 having arrived from another zoo, Mr Woodward said.\n\"The mother is loving showing the babies off to the public. She's been brilliant,\" he added.\nAccording to the IUCN, 98% of lemur species are threatened with extinction, and 31% of species are critically endangered because their habitat has been converted for farming in their native Madagascar.\nA small animal, they will only be between 30cm and 40cm (11.8in to 15.7in) tall when fully grown.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) , and Instagram .

    "The author of a book set at Clarks shoe factory wants to show the employer was \"the real heart of the town\".\nAlison Knight said her novel about women working at the site in Street, Somerset, during World War One used \"real events\".\nPrior to writing it, she extensively researched the factory and the lives of people working there.\nMs Knight said she felt \"excited and terrified\" before the book's publication.\n\"So many people I've met have worked at Clarks, their families have worked there for generations and so much of the village was built by the Clark family to benefit the community,\" Ms Knight told BBC Radio Somerset.\n\"I live right here in the centre of the Clarks' heartland, so if I've got it wrong, people are going to let me know,\" she added.\nFormer workers at the factory still regularly share their memories at gatherings of the Clarks Social Club.\n\"The breakup for Christmas was always a big event in the factory with most of the workers enjoying a few beverages in the local pubs at lunchtime,\" recalled one employee.\n\"One year it was made clear to everyone that too much drinking would not be tolerated and no one would be allowed home early.\n\"A large number got together and on their return started to dance the conga all around the factory floor gathering up more people as they progressed up and down the aisles.\n\"When they reached the main door they danced through it and disappeared off home (or back to the pub!). The bosses were red-faced with rage but couldn't sack them as there were so many involved,\" they added.\nThe first published story in Ms Knight's series, The Clarks Factory Girls at War, starts in 1914 and introduces three main characters - Jeannie, Kate and Louisa, who work together in the factory.\nMs Knight said she did a lot of research in the Alfred Gillett Reading Room in Street to provide integrity to her writing.\n'I was amazed'\n\"The archivists were brilliant; finding documents and photographs for me to study that gave me a real flavour of what it was like working at Clarks during the First World War.\n\"There were minute meetings and even letters to and from members of the Clark family.\n\"I took some real events happening at that time and fictionalised them, although I did use a couple of names of real directors and a forewoman from the time,\" she said.\nThe Clark family were Quakers, part of a pacifist movement during the war.\nMs Knight said she had discovered the Clarks were generous to both the people left behind from war and the men who returned wounded.\n\"I was amazed with what I found. Clarks gave extra lessons to younger boys who came to work in the factory, so they could continue some of their education.\n\"They were very aware that life was changing dramatically during the war and were trying to do their best for the community.\" she said.\nMs Knight writes under the name May Ellis, which was also the name of her grandmother.\nShe said: \"The original May Ellis was born in 1900 so would have been a contemporary of the girls I write about in these books.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X .

    "After eight years in the making, London's \u00c2\u00a35bn super sewer has been completed.\nKnown officially as the Thames Tideway Tunnel, it has been designed to reduce the amount of raw sewage that flows into the river.\nThe 16 mile (25km) long pipe will divert 34 of the most polluting sewage outflows (CSO's) that have been discharging into the Thames.\nCritics say with climate change the tunnel may have a limited lifespan.\n\"This is the moment we've all been waiting for,\" Andy Mitchell the CEO of Thames Tideway told BBC News from a boat above the tunnel on the Thames.\n\"We're going to capture the vast, vast majority of the sewage that comes into the river and it will mean a cleaner river,\" he says.\nIn the final step of construction, a huge 1,200 tonne concrete lid was lifted onto a shaft in east London.\nLondon's combined sewage system handles human waste and rain runoff together, but the capital's population has outgrown the infrastructure.\nRaw sewage under normal conditions goes to wastewater treatment plants but currently, even a small amount of drizzle in London can overwhelm the network, triggering overflows into the Thames.\nThe new super sewer will mean that instead of flowing into the river, almost all sewage overflows in the centre of London will be stored in the tunnel until it can be processed.\nThe first sewage is expected to flow into the tunnel this summer and it should be fully operational in 2025. Initially expected to cost \u00c2\u00a34.2bn, the tunnel has ending up costing about \u00c2\u00a35bn. That cost will be paid for by Thames Water customers over several decades with bills increasing by about \u00c2\u00a325 a year.\nThe 7.2m (23ft) wide tunnel flows steadily downhill from Acton in west London to Abbey Mills in the east and during periods of sustained rainfall it will fill up with a mix of raw sewage and storm water.\nIt can hold 600 Olympic sized swimming pools of liquid which will then be pumped to Europe's largest sewage treatment works at Beckton in east London.\nAfter testing over the summer the super sewer will be handed over to Thames Water, a water company about \u00c2\u00a315bn in debt and dogged by constant rumours of financial problems. So why should they be trusted to run the super sewer?\n\"We have had our challenges. It's absolutely fair to say that.\" Tessa Fayers, Thames Water's operations director for Thames Valley and Home Counties, told BBC News.\n\"But I think one of the things if you go back in our heritage back to the 1800s Thames Water is phenomenal at delivering infrastructure solutions that provide fantastic sanitation services to the city of London.\"\nThough the super sewer is one of the biggest upgrades to London's sewage network since it was built by Joseph Bazalgette in the 1860s, it is unlikely to be a permanent solution.\nScientists predict that climate change will bring more intense rainfall to the UK, meaning there will be times when even the huge super sewer fills up.\n\"The super sewer is a massive, expensive pipe and I think the Victorians would be a bit embarrassed that we haven't come up with a more modern solution than that,\" says Theo Thomas from campaign group London Waterkeeper.\nMr Thomas would rather the money had been spent right across London on projects that stopped rain flowing directly into drains where it mixes with raw sewage.\n\"You could use nature to be dealing with this. You could have lots of areas that would soak up the rain rather than rush it off the streets and rush it off the roofs straight into the sewers.\"\nThe view is at least partly shared by Thames Tideway's Andy Mitchell.  Though he says it simply wasn't feasible to quickly and affordably build London a new network that separated out sewage and rainwater.\n\"Without the super sewer, this spilling of sewage into the river was just going to get more and more frequent and in bigger volumes, and that's what we've addressed,\" he says.\n\"What we've done is bought London time. Fifty, sixty, seventy years to do something more intelligent with rainwater than simply mix it with sewage.\"",

    "Ultra high-definition cameras from a UK start-up are on their way to the International Space Station (ISS).\nThe 4K system from SEN.COM will be attached to the front of the orbital outpost to capture what are expected to be some stunning views of Earth.\nThe London company already streams live video from a small satellite it launched in 2022.\nBoss Charles Black says he plans to extend the company's technology to many more locations, including the Moon.\n\"Our goal is to bring a whole new way of seeing space, Earth and the Moon,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We want to put cameras in lunar orbit, on the lunar surface and on lunar rovers, filming astronauts as humans return to the Moon.\n\"We want to tell that story.\"\nThe ISS cameras are being carried up on the latest US space agency re-supply mission.\nMore than 2.5 tonnes of food, clothing, equipment and scientific experiments were launched atop a SpaceX rocket from Florida at 16:55 local time (20:55 GMT).\nAfter arrival on Saturday, SEN's camera payload will be prepped by the station crew and then put through an airlock to be placed on the Bartolomeo deck - a piece of exterior structure connected to the European Columbus science module.\nThe big robotic CanadaArm-2 will do the manoeuvres, scheduled for May.\nOne camera will look straight ahead at the horizon, capturing sunrises and sunsets, as well as the northern and southern lights.\nA second camera will point straight down, to focus on what's happening on Planet Earth. The capacity scene size will be about 180km by 240km (110 miles by 150 miles). It will see features as small as 60m across.\nThe controlling software should be able to adjust the exposures so that when the station moves into darkness, city lights will be visible.\nA third camera will be directed at the forward docking point to record the comings and goings of space capsules - the SpaceX Dragon ship and the soon-to-debut Boeing Starliner.\nThe plan is to stream 4K video - jumping between these cameras - more or less continuously. The data will come down through the European Space Agency's relay system, which bounces signals to the ground via high-throughput satellites positioned high above the space station.\nYou can get a feel for the type of video anticipated from the samples on this page. They were captured by SEN's ETV-A1 satellite, which has been operating for the past two years at an altitude of 505km. More of these spacecraft are currently being assembled.\nAgain, it's a mix of wide and narrow-angle views.\nThe London company is monetising these products, working, for example, with film and TV companies on documentaries.\nThe firm is also hoping to engender interest from news organisations who might want to reflect events in a different way, especially if those events have global reach. Last year's Canadian wildfires would be a good example. Seeing their fire fronts and smoke plumes gives a much clearer sense of just how big an area was burnt.\nSEN is by no means the first company to move into the \"video from space\" market, but Mr Black believes he can find success by packaging the material in the right way.\n\"Video from space is important and will be big business... because real-time video has story-telling power, and can deliver insights about what's happening directly to people, in the same way Google does,\" he said.\n\"Google Earth had over a billion downloads to look at static imagery, so a real-time dataset about Earth which tells the story of what's unfolding on Earth and in space right now, which is fully searchable and uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to show insights, will be a mass data product for humanity.\n\"No-one has addressed that market before, and that's what we're doing.\"",

    "A man whose son was injured in a crush at a school gate has criticised its handling of the incident.\nGordano School in Portishead, near Bristol, says the gate was not open in time at the end of the school day on Monday so a \"surge\" led to injuries.\nGlyn said his son had two black eyes and print marks on parts of his body from other students' shoes.\nThe school says it is investigating what happened and will update the community.\nHead teacher Louise Blundell said pupils were being supported and a \"whole school online broadcast\" to address what happened was taking place.\nVideos of the incident have been shared on social media, showing several pupils on the floor being helped by others.\nGlyn said he hoped the school was going to support the pupils, and that his son Oliver, a Year 9 pupil, was \"feeling very subdued\".\nHaving grown in Liverpool at the time of the Hillsborough disaster, which led to 97 Liverpool fans losing their lives after a crush at an FA Cup semi final, Glyn told the BBC the incident at the school \"impacted me really hard\".\nHe said: \"Where are the teachers? Where are the teachers pushing the kids back or organising them?\n\"When the gates are open you have five, six, seven hundreds pupils all going for one gate.\n\"Surely there must be somebody there who says 'actually you cannot go through this'?\n\"This is all common sense, this is a small gate.\"\nHe claimed that when parents collected their kids the school \"only said there was an incident\", adding that he was \"totally dissatisfied with what has gone on\".\nGlyn added: \"To learn from your own son and daughter that this has happened, and being shown videos going around from other pupils and the school not doing anything about it is extremely wrong.\"\n'Safety of utmost importance'\nMs Blundell said: \"There was an incident at one of our exit gates yesterday [Monday], when a gate was not opened in time for the end of the day.\n\"This resulted in a surge of students trying to leave the school site, which led to some pupils being injured.\n\"Staff were immediately on the scene and several students visited the school's first aider before going home.\n\"This morning we have been reviewing the situation as well as offering support to students and running an additional whole school online broadcast to address what happened.\n\"The safety and wellbeing of students is of the upmost importance to Gordano School, and we will continue to investigate what happened and update the school community in due course.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Campaigner Richard Taylor, the father of Damilola Taylor who was killed 24 years ago, has died, it has been announced.\nHis son was 10 years old when he was stabbed in the leg and left to die in a south London stairwell in 2000.\nThe former Nigerian civil servant dedicated years to improving the lives of disadvantaged children in the wake of his son's death.\nMr Taylor died on Saturday aged 75 with prostate cancer.\nHe set up the Damilola Taylor Trust to campaign against knife crime.\nA statement issued on behalf of his family said: \"It is with a heavy heart that the family announce the death of our beloved father, grandfather and uncle, Mr Richard Adeyemi Taylor OBE, who sadly passed away in the early hours of Saturday March 23 at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich, after a prolonged battle with prostate cancer.\"\nMr Taylor said he wanted his son to be remembered as a boy of hope and for his legacy to be a better life and opportunities for underprivileged young people.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer was among those paying tribute, saying in a post on X: \"Richard championed breaking down barriers to opportunity through the Damilola Taylor Trust, in honour of his son's memory.\n\"He will be remembered for his courage, determination and message of hope. My condolences to Richard's family and friends.\"\nDamilola was left bleeding to death in a stairwell in Peckham, south-east London, after he was attacked and slashed with a broken bottle on his way home from a library.\nThe boy's death shocked the nation and became one of London's most high-profile killings.\nAfter three crown court trials, his killers - brothers Ricky and Danny Preddie - were jailed in 2006.\nRichard Taylor and his late wife Gloria were spurred on to set up a charity in their son's memory following his death.\nMr Taylor was awarded an OBE in 2012 for his crusade against violent crime and dedicated it to the memory of Damilola.\nDamilola was killed on 27 November 2000, months after he moved to the UK from Nigeria with his mother, brother Tunde and sister Gbemi in the summer of 2000.\nMr Taylor stayed working for the Nigerian civil service and the family settled in Peckham as they aimed to get medical treatment for Gbemi, who had a severe form of epilepsy.\nDamilola had ambitions for a future in the medical profession to carry out research to help his sister.\nMrs Taylor died in 2008 after suffering a heart attack and Mr Taylor continued their work in the following years.\nWhen Mr Taylor stepped back from campaigning in early-2020, he told journalists how he had done his bit for two decades.\n\"Twenty years has taken a toll on me,\" he said.\nHe campaigned about the effects of knife crime and spoke at schools about the devastation, loss, and pain he and his family had endured.\nCelebrity support\nHe had met royalty, prime ministers, home secretaries, and police leaders to bring about change with his mission, he said, to keep Damilola's name at the forefront of policy makers.\nThe family was supported by several celebrities, including footballer Rio Ferdinand, who grew up in Peckham and backed their charity work.\nStar Wars actor John Boyega was a childhood friend of Damilola and he and his sister Grace were among the last people to see the 10-year-old alive before he walked home on the day he was killed.\nDamilola's death raised many questions including what leads young people to commit such acts of violence.\nBoth the Preddie brothers had been in and out of children's homes and were 12 and 13 when they killed Damilola.\nOne social worker told the Old Bailey trial: \"These children were wild, we couldn't control them, they were constantly running away, we couldn't do anything\".\nThe brothers were sentenced to serve eight years in youth custody. Ricky Preddie and Danny Preddie were given early release in 2010 and 2011, respectively.\nDespite their ages, neither were awarded anonymity orders unlike other child killers, which angered some social justice campaigners. Richard Taylor had once said he \"could never forgive the Preddie brothers\".\nThe Damilola Taylor Trust runs a number of outreach programmes including internship schemes, educational courses and mentoring project, which was launched with the support of former footballer Ferdinand.\nIn 2017, a BBC drama called Damilola, Our Loved Boy was made, which told of the family's struggle for justice and went on to win two Baftas.\nMr Taylor supported a march against knife crime in central London in 2008 attended by thousands of young people and led by the Ben Kinsella Trust.\nThe trust was founded by former EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella, whose 16-year-old brother Ben was stabbed to death in Islington.\nShe said Mr Taylor's courage had been an inspiration.\n\"After the horrific loss of his son Damilola, he chose to channel his pain into a fight for a safer future.\n\"He turned tragedy into a relentless determination to keep other families from experiencing the same heartbreak.\"\nA spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police paid tribute",

    "The bodies of two men have been recovered, and four others are presumed dead, after a container ship hit Baltimore's iconic Francis Scott Key Bridge early on Tuesday.\nThe US Coast Guard said it will suspend its massive search and rescue effort, as divers are no longer able to navigate the waters safely because of concrete and debris found in the river.\nBut officials have pledged to find the bodies of the men for their relatives.\nThe men are believed to be members of a pothole-repair crew who were working on the bridge and are citizens of Latin American countries.\nFour of the six victims have been named so far.\nThe two bodies were recovered inside a vehicle, Colonel Roland Butler of the Maryland State Police said at a press conference on Wednesday. They were identified as Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, and Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, 26. Mr Fuentes is originally from Mexico and Mr Cabrera is from Guatemala.\nLittle information has been released about the others' identities, but here's what we know so far:\nThe six workers were citizens of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\nOne of the missing workers from El Salvador was identified as Miguel Luna by the non-profit organization Casa, which provides services to the immigrant community in Baltimore, as well as by the country's foreign minister.\n\"He is a husband, a father of three, and has called Maryland his home for over 19 years,\" Casa executive director Gustavo Torres said in a statement.\nMarvin Luna, son of Miguel Luna, told the Washington Post that he knew his father was on the bridge overnight but did not know it had collapsed until friends called him and said: \"The bridge is gone.\"\nHonduras's migrant protection service has identified a second victim as Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval.\nEl Heraldo, a Honduran newspaper, has reported that he was from Santa Barbara department in the country's west.\nMr Sandoval's brother told NBC News that the family was informed of his disappearance just hours after the bridge collapsed in the early hours of Tuesday morning.\n\"The hope we have is to be able to see the body,\" Carlos Suazo Sandoval was quoted as saying. \"We want to see him, find him, know whether he is dead, because we don't know anything.\"\nMaynor Sandoval had lived in the US for the past 18 years and was married with two children, a five-year-old daughter and an 18-year-old son, his brother told US media.\nHis brother described him as a very hard working man who had moved to the US in search for a better life for his family and who dreamt of opening a small business. He had also donated money to a children's football league in Honduras that allowed kids to play, Carlos added.\nSome of his family members paid tribute to him on social media as news emerged that he was among the missing.\n\"I can't believe this Maynor, that Friday would be the last time I saw you,\" one woman wrote in Spanish on Facebook. \"I will always remember you.\"\nGuatemala's foreign affairs ministry has also confirmed that two of the workers were Guatemalan nationals, from the regions of Pet\u00c3\u00a9n and Chiquimula, but has not yet named them. One of them is now known to be Mr Cabrera, whose body was recovered from the water on Wednesday.\nOn Wednesday, Mexican President Andres Manuel L\u00c3\u00b3pez Obrador confirmed that two of the missing are Mexican nationals - one is Mr Fuentes, whose body was also recovered.\nA third Mexican national was rescued, Mr L\u00c3\u00b3pez Obrador added.\nOfficials said two people were rescued from the water on Tuesday, one of whom was sent to hospital and was later released.\nMr L\u00c3\u00b3pez Obrador declined to give further details, noting that relatives had asked officials to keep their information private. Mexico's foreign ministry has only shared that the two missing are from the states of Michoac\u00c3\u00a1n and Veracruz.\nThe six men were employed by Brawner Builders, a local contractor that carries out maintenance work on bridges in Maryland state.\nJesus Campos, who has worked on the bridge for the company and knows members of the crew, said he was told they were on a break and some were sitting in their trucks.\n\"I know that a month ago, I was there, and I know what it feels like when the trailers pass,\" Mr Campos told the Associated Press.\n\"Imagine knowing that is falling.

    "Properties connected to rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs were raided on Monday by federal agents.\nThe Department of Homeland Security said it had pursued the \"law enforcement actions as part of an ongoing investigation\" in New York, Los Angeles and Miami.\nTwo properties were searched in Los Angeles and Miami as part of the probe.\nOfficials did not specify the reasons for the raids or whether they were tied to Mr Combs.\nSeveral recent lawsuits have accused Mr Combs of sexual misconduct.\nIn a statement, lawyers for Mr Combs said the accusations against him were \"meritless\" and described the raids as a \"gross overuse of military-level force\".\nOn Monday, Homeland Security Investigations agents were conducting their operations in the 17,000 square foot mansion where Mr Combs announced his latest album release last September.\nThe address of the house is associated with Mr Combs' Bad Boy Films production company. Located in the wealthy Los Angeles neighbourhood of Holmby Hills, the area is home to numerous celebrities and the Playboy Mansion.\nTwo law enforcement officials told the Associated Press that the raids were part of an ongoing sex-trafficking investigation.\nThe BBC has not independently confirmed this reporting.\nLast year, R&B singer Cassie, whose full name is Casandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against Mr Combs, whom she had dated between 2005 and 2018.\nIn court documents, she alleged years of abuse at the hands of the rapper, though she later settled the lawsuit with him.\nTwo other women then came forward with their own lawsuits, accusing him of sexual abuse. A man also has come forward accusing Mr Combs of sexual misconduct.\nDouglas Wigdor, lawyer for Ms Ventura and another alleged victim, said on Monday that his clients supported the law enforcement efforts.\n\"Hopefully, this is the beginning of a process that will hold Mr Combs responsible for his depraved conduct,\" Mr Wigdor said in a statement.\nOn Tuesday, attorney Aaron Dyer, who represents Mr Combs, reiterated that his client had not been arrested and said the raid was \"nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits\".\n\"There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated,\" he said.\n\"Mr. Combs was never detained but spoke to and cooperated with authorities.\n\"There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations. Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.\"\nMr Combs remains one of the most influential and significant hip-hop producers of the past several decades.\nHe is the founder of Bad Boy Records and is a three-time Grammy winner who has worked with A-list artists like Usher and Mary J Blige.",
    "Forty-five people have died in South Africa after the bus they were in plunged some 50m (165ft) off a bridge into a ravine, authorities say.\nAn eight-year-old girl, the only survivor, was taken to hospital with serious injuries.\nThe bus crashed through a barrier and caught fire when it hit the ground in the north-eastern Limpopo province.\nThe passengers were pilgrims travelling from Botswana's capital Gaborone to an Easter service in the town of Moria.\nThe vehicle lost control and went off a bridge on the Mmamatlakala mountain pass between Mokopane and Marken, around 300km (190 miles) north of Johannesburg, according to South African public broadcaster SABC.\nRescue operations went on late into Thursday evening, with some of those killed reportedly hard to reach amid the debris.\nTransport Minister Sindisiwe Chikunga, who went to the scene of the incident, extended her \"heartfelt condolences to the families affected by the tragic bus crash\".\nShe said the South African government would help repatriate the bodies and hold a full inquiry into the cause of the crash.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with you during this difficult time,\" she added. \"We continue to urge responsible driving at all times with heightened alertness as more people are on our roads this Easter weekend.\"\nSouth Africa has a poor road safety record.\nIn an Easter message released earlier in the day, President Cyril Ramaphosa urged citizens to \"do our best to make this a safe Easter\".\nIt should \"not be a time where we sit back and wait to see statistics on tragedy or injuries on our roads\", he added.",
    "The collapse of a bridge in the US city of Baltimore will result in the largest single marine insurance loss ever, a British insurance marketplace said.\nSix people were presumed dead after a ship crashed into the bridge, and divers have recovered two bodies.\nExperts say the damages could cost as much as $3bn (\u00c2\u00a32.3bn).\n\"I would say it's certainly going to be one of the largest marine losses in history,\" said John Neal, chief executive officer of Lloyd's of London.\n\"Of that there is little or no doubt,\" Mr Neal told the BBC. \"But genuinely the good news is it's insured.\"\nMr Neal said the port and the ship that crashed into the bridge are also insured.\n\"So from a financial point of view, there is a process that will allow for financial compensation to be made and for the claim to be settled,\" he said.\nThe Maryland Department of Transportation has so far asked the Biden administration for $60m in emergency funds to help clear debris and clean up after the incident.\nAddressing the bridge collapse is not the only expense, either. Until the shipping lane is reopened, experts say the incident could lead to losses of up to $15m (\u00c2\u00a311.8m) because of how vital the Baltimore port is to global commerce.\nMr Neal would not offer a number for how much insurance companies may be billed for the collision, but analysts at Barclays have said the claims could cost insurance companies as much as $3bn.\nThe analysts said damages to the bridge itself could amount to $1.2bn, while insurance companies may face fees between $350m and $700m for wrongful deaths.\nClosure of one of the US' biggest ports while the bridge is repaired could also cost millions of dollars, Barclays' analysts said.\nThe Port of Baltimore is the 14th largest in the US. In 2023, 52.3 million tonnes of foreign cargo, worth $80.8bn, passed through Baltimore, according to data from the state of Maryland.\nExperts have stressed that the closure of the part could have ripple effects on global supply chains.\nPresident Joe Biden has said the federal government should cover the cost to rebuild the bridge.\nPaul Wiedefeld, secretary of the Maryland Department of Transportation, and other officials noted that resolving the bridge collapse will not be a quick process.\nBut he promised at a press conference on Wednesday that officials were working to \"come up with a design for the replacement of that bridge as quickly as possible to get the port back up and the community back up and running\".",
    "Former Health Secretary Michael Matheson has said he will not resign as an MSP after he was found to have breached parliamentary rules.\nMr Matheson said he was respecting the parliament's standards procedures but answered \"no\" when asked if he was going to step down.\nHe spoke when leaving an SNP group meeting at Holyrood earlier.\nThe Conservatives have urged the first minister to remove the whip from the Falkirk West MSP.\nSpeaking to journalists at Holyrood for the first time since the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) issued its findings, he said he hoped Holyrood's standards process would conclude \"shortly\".\nAsked if he would resign, he answered \"no\", adding: \"As you know, there is a standards process at the moment and I'm going to respect the confidentiality of that process.\nHe did not respond to further questions from journalists.\nMr Matheson quit his Cabinet role in February following months of pressure over a near \u00c2\u00a311,000 data roaming bill racked up on his parliamentary iPad during a family holiday to Morocco.\nWhen details of the bill were first made public, he said the device had only been used for parliamentary work but he subsequently admitted that his sons had used the iPad as a data hotspot so they could watch football.\nHe has since paid back the bill in full and apologised.\n'Face the consequences'\nEarlier this month, the SPCB - the cross-party group of MSPs tasked with the running of the Scottish Parliament - concluded that Mr Matheson had broken the code of conduct for members over his handling of the bill.\nIt referred his case to Holyrood's standards, procedures and public appointments committee to consider sanctions.\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"It's telling that, despite weeks of evading scrutiny, the only question he chose to answer was the one confirming that he won't do the decent thing and resign as an MSP.\n\"Throughout this whole sorry saga, self-interest and self-preservation have been his guiding principles. Nothing changes.\n\"Michael Matheson only found himself being door-stepped by journalists because Humza Yousaf lacks the backbone to remove the party whip from his disgraced colleague.\"\nThe first minister has resisted calls from opposition MSPs to remove the whip from Mr Matheson.\nAppearing on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show earlier this month, Mr Yousaf said Mr Matheson was a \"decent person\" that had \"made a mistake\" but said he should not have to stand down from his role as an MSP.\n\"There are MSPs that have made mistakes and they've had to face the consequences of those mistakes,\" he told the programme.\n\"I've not heard Michael say anything other than he'll accept what those consequences are, and I'm sure he'll accept whatever the parliamentary committee decides and deliberates on.\"",

    "In India's high-altitude Ladakh region, thousands are protesting in sub-zero temperatures. In 2019, the government fulfilled their longstanding demand for a region separate from Indian-administered Kashmir. But since 2020, they have frequently taken to streets, accusing the government of \"betrayal\" and unkept promises. Srinagar-based freelance journalist Auqib Javeed reports on what's changed.\nLadakh, India's northern-most region, is a desert inhabited by 300,000 people from the Muslim and Buddhist communities. The Leh region is dominated by Buddhists while the Kargil region is inhabited by Shia Muslims.\nFor decades, the Buddhist community demanded a separate region for its people, while those in Kargil wanted to be integrated with the Muslim-majority region of India-administered Kashmir.\nIn 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked Article 370 of the constitution which accorded special status to the former state of Jammu and Kashmir and gave it significant autonomy. The state was then divided into two parts - Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir - and both are federally administered territories.\nA year later, Kargil and Leh districts joined hands and formed the Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), aimed at addressing people's concerns. The civil society groups have held massive rallies against the federal government.\nEarlier this week, shops closed and thousands took to the streets in Kargil to demand statehood. In Leh, protesters have planned a border march next week.\n\"We were demanding a separate territory with a legislature,\" says Chhering Dorjey Lakrook, a veteran Buddhist leader from Leh. \"But we were granted only a federally governed territory.\"\nFor people in Ladakh, who depend primarily on agriculture, the move also sparked fears it would affect the region's culture and identity as it made it easier for those from outside the region to buy land in the area.\nAccording to India's home ministry, as of 5 April 2023, no Indian company had invested in Ladakh in the past three years, nor had anyone from outside purchased any land.\nBut residents remain apprehensive about an influx like in Jammu and Kashmir where, data shows, 185 outsiders have bought land between 2020-22.\nTheir demands include statehood for Ladakh, jobs, protection of their land and resources, and a parliamentary seat each for Leh and Kargil districts.\nThey also want implementation of the Sixth Schedule, a constitutional provision that protects tribal populations and allows them to set up autonomous organisations that frame laws on land, health and agriculture. Nearly 97% of Ladakh's population is tribal.\n\"The Sixth Schedule was designed to protect the rights of indigenous and tribal groups,\" says Chhering Dorjey Lakrook, who until 2020 was president of the regional unit of India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This, he adds, will save them from exploitation by industrialists.\nThe federal home ministry set up a committee to discuss these demands, but locals say there has been no progress.\nYoung people in the region are also concerned about not getting government jobs.\nPadma Stanzin, who heads Ladakh Students' Environmental Action Forum (Leaf), says since 2019, not a single person has been recruited in a senior government role. \"We fear our jobs will be taken over by outsiders,\" she adds.\nLadakh's BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal did not respond to BBC's request for comments.\nLadakh holds significant geostrategic importance for India as it shares borders with both China and Pakistan, the two countries which strongly condemned India's decision to revoke Article 370.\nWhile Indian-administered Kashmir witnessed a protracted armed uprising against Delhi's rule starting in late 1980s, the militancy never spread to Ladakh.\nIn the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan, residents in Ladakh volunteered support by supplying food and other essentials to Indian soldiers.\nResidents now wonder if they are paying the price for being \"loyal\".\n\"The spirit of that voluntarism will not remain if the government hurts the sentiments of the people,\" says Sonam Wangchuk, an engineer, innovator and climate activist, who has worked for years to address local community needs.\nMr Wangchuk, who gained fame after Bollywood star Aamir Khan played a character based on him in the 2009 blockbuster Three Idiots, is on a 21-day-long fast \"to remind the government of its promises to safeguard Ladakh's environment and tribal indigenous culture\".\nPeople of Ladakh, he says, have offered support to Indian soldiers, including to personnel from the plains who have struggled to adapt to high altitude. \"Any kind of disturbance will impact this spirit,\" he adds.\nExperts say China and Pakistan would watch for any sign of \"weakness\" in the region.\n\"Unrest and discontent, especially if sustained, is something that Beijing and Islamabad could try to exploit,\" says Michael Kugelman, director of Washington-based think-tank South Asia Institute at the Wilson Centre",
    "A million people are without power across Ukraine after Russian missiles targeted energy infrastructure.\nThere is no electricity in the second-largest city of Kharkiv, the regional head says, and more than 53,000 households in Odesa are without power.\nUkraine's energy minister, German Galushchenko, accused Russia of trying to provoke \"a large-scale failure of the country's energy system\".\nRussia said it was revenge for recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory.\nAt least five people have been reported killed and 14 wounded.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said the latest wave of attacks showed that Western allies must give more military aid to Ukraine, including additional air defence systems.\n\"There are no delays in Russian missiles like there are in assistance to our country,\" he wrote on Telegram.\nSome 90 missiles and 60 Shahed drones were launched into Ukraine during the wave of overnight attacks, he said.\nAmong the targets was Ukraine's largest dam - the DniproHES in Zaporizhzhia, which was hit eight times according to Ukrainian officials. Video footage appeared to show the dam on fire, but authorities say there is no threat of an imminent breach.\nOfficials also say that a trolleybus which was crossing the dam at the time caught fire after a missile strike, killing the driver.\n\"At 04:30 all hell broke loose. Terrible fireworks and explosions. At one point, our house tilted,\" Valentyna, an eyewitness whose house overlooks the dam told the BBC.\nThe UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant lost connection to the main power line for almost five hours on Friday following the Russian attacks.\nThis highlighted the \"ever-present dangers to nuclear safety and security during the conflict\", it said.\nThe plant, however, continued to receive external electricity for reactor cooling from its only remaining back-up power line.\nRegional head Ivan Fedorov said seven buildings in Zaporizhzhia had been destroyed and 35 others damaged.\nStrikes were also reported in President Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rih and in Vinnytsia, both in central Ukraine. They damaged a \"critical infrastructure object\", said Ukrainian officials.\nRussia's defence ministry said the assault on Ukraine's power grid was part of a series of revenge attacks against Kyiv for its earlier incursions into Russian territory.\nLocal officials in the Russian region of Belgorod, near the border with Ukraine, said on Thursday that a woman had been killed and many other people wounded by a Ukrainian strike.\nThe fresh attacks come a day after Russian forces launched one of their biggest air strikes in weeks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. At least 17 people, including a child, were injured by falling debris.\nAttacks on the energy grid has been part of Russia's warfare against Ukraine since 2022.\nMoscow has previously carried out strikes on Ukrainian power infrastructure plunging millions of people into darkness and depriving them of heat, power and water.\nAttacks during the autumn and winter of 2022 left 17 million Ukrainians without a regular supply of electricity for extended periods.\nBut the head of the Ukrainian grid operator, Volodymyr Kudrytsky, said Thursday night's attacks were worse.\n\"Even last winter, attacks on our energy system weren't so bad as last night. Dozens of grid facilities have been hit. This is on a global scale.\"\nMr Kudrytsky added that the worst affected area was Kharkiv, where \"Russia literally tried to destroy all the main energy facilities feeding the city\".\nPresident Zelensky has often described the Russian attacks on power stations as \"energy terrorism\".\nThe White House condemned Thursday's attacks and renewed its call for urgent additional air defences for Ukraine as soon as possible.\nEarlier this month, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two top Russian commanders , accusing them of ordering attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.",

    "Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff is making his TV return after his Top Gear accident with a second series of BBC One cricket documentary, Field of Dreams.\nThe news, announced in the BBC's annual plan , says Flintoff will be seen taking his young sports team - who hail from his home city of Preston - on tour.\nThe BBC had previously stated they were working with him on \"new projects\" .\nIts Top Gear show will not return for the \"foreseeable future\" after Flintoff was hurt during filming in 2022 .\nThe BBC had previously announced in October 2022 that a second series of Field of Dreams had been commissioned but there were no further updates given following Flintoff's accident two months later.\nIt's not yet known when the new series will air.\nThe first series aired in July 2022.\nDescribed by the New Statesman's Rachel Cooke as \"the most moving thing I've seen on TV in years\" , it saw Flintoff determined to get a group of Preston teenagers to become motivated and engaged in his beloved sport, with plenty of ups and downs along the way.\nIn the original press release about the second series , the BBC said: \"Freddie is setting himself an even bigger challenge as he takes some of his team and a handful of fresh recruits on a new adventure.\" adding that there would be four episodes.\nThe presenter was injured at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\nFlintoff reached a settlement with the BBC last year , reportedly worth \u00c2\u00a39m. The payout will not be funded by the TV licence fee, as BBC Studios is a commercial arm of the broadcaster.\nThe BBC apologised to Flintoff in March 2023 over his injuries , as it announced a health and safety review of the show. It was expected to be undertaken by an independent third party.\nIt reiterated that apology in October when the compensation for Flintoff was announced.\nFlintoff was pictured for the first time since the accident in September, as he led fielding drills with England players in Cardiff ahead of the team's one-day international with New Zealand.\nMore recent photos have shown that his injuries have continued to heal.\nThe 45-year-old former England captain retired from cricket in 2009 having played 79 Tests, 141 one-day internationals and seven T20s.\nHe joined BBC One's Top Gear as a host in 2019 alongside Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris. Their most recent series attracted an average audience of 4.5 million viewers.\nThe BBC also announced that Gladiators will return to the Sheffield Arena for a second series. The first series of the show's reboot will conclude on Saturday as the final four fight it out to be crowned champion.\nIt has been one of the most successful TV reboots in recent years - the opening episode got an audience of nearly 10 million, including 28-day catch-up figures.\nThe recommissioning was revealed in the BBC's annual plan, which also said it would be an expensive year for the BBC with the Olympics in Paris and Euro 2024, held in Germany.\n\"It is clear that substantial public funding is vital to the BBC's future to allow us to deliver our public service mission,\" the plan says.\n\"In real terms, the licence fee generated 30% more income in 2010/11 than it does today - a difference of more than \u00c2\u00a31 billion a year. Various costs have been added, followed by two years of a frozen licence fee at a time of high inflation.\n\"This has also coincided with a reduction across the media sector in the availability of 'co-production' funding to help spread the investment into some of our larger titles and programmes.\n\"Other wider sector challenges have also increased financial pressure on the BBC's commercial activities.

    "Labour is planning to invest in building floating wind farms off Britain's coast to reduce the UK's reliance on foreign energy.\nSir Keir Starmer has announced Labour will set up a state-owned firm with a \u00c2\u00a38.3bn budget which it claims will help cut energy bills and create jobs.\nLabour has pledged to decarbonise the UK by 2030, while the Conservatives target 2035 for net zero energy supply.\nThe Tories said Labour's plan was \"unfunded\" and would mean higher taxes.\nAhead of a general election, Labour and the Conservatives have pledged to make the UK's energy supply more secure after the price shocks that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nAt a port in North Wales, Sir Keir announced on Monday that Great British Energy, a publicly-owned company, will fund the construction of floating offshore wind farms.\n\"In an increasingly insecure world, with tyrants using energy as an economic weapon, Britain must take back control of our national energy security.\" he will say.\nThe most recent figures show that the UK imported nearly 40% of its energy in 2022.\nSir Keir said: \"Here in Wales, the potential for offshore wind is enormous, and the UK Tory government is squandering it. With public investment through Great British Energy we can unlock billions more in private investment to turbocharge jobs and growth for Wales.\"\nBut Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho, said \"Sir Keir Starmer can't say what he will do to protect our energy security because he does not have a plan - he set out a 2030 decarbonisation promise, which Labour themselves costed at \u00c2\u00a328bn without a plan to pay for it.\"\nLabour recently dropped a pledge to spend \u00c2\u00a328bn a year on environmental projects if it wins the general election, which must be held by 28 January, 2025.\nSir Keir blamed the \"damage the Tories have done to the economy\" for the U-turn. But he promised to stick to other commitments including battery factories and wind farms with British-made turbines.\nHe also stood by Labour's 2030 timeline, telling the BBC that while it was a \"difficult target\" it is \"important\", adding that it is key to have a deadline to work towards.\nAdrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green Party, described Labour's \u00c2\u00a38.3bn investment plan as \"a drop in the ocean\".\n\"Especially since it follows the Party ditching its \u00c2\u00a328bn a year green investment plan,\" he said. \"The Green Party would invest whatever is needed to turbocharge the move to renewables, ensuring wind provides around 70% of the UK's electricity by 2030.\"\nFloating wind farms are a relatively new means of generating renewable energy with very few in operation. The first was built off the coast of Peterhead in Scotland and consists of five wind turbines, led by Norwegian firm Equinor.\nFloating farms allow turbines to be placed further out at sea, where wind speeds may be greater, unlike traditional wind farms which are fixed to the seabed usually in waters less than 60 metres deep. The floating turbines off the coast of Aberdeen are kept in place using three suction anchors attached to each turbine.\nAs well as offshore wind, Labour said they would veto any new oil and gas licences in UK waters if elected.\nThe Conservatives plan to continue granting fossil fuel permits and have a 2035 target for net zero energy supplies. The government insists that rejecting future UK based oil and gas production will cost jobs and jeopardise UK energy security.\nSir Keir said: \"So far as oil and gas licenses are concerned, we've been very clear we're not going to revoke or interfere with any existing licenses so they will be a part of the mix for decades to come.\n\"But clean power is the way to ensure we get lower bills for the long term, that we get the stability and security we need, so Putin can't put his boot on our throat, but crucially so we get the next generation of jobs.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats also back a 2030 target for net zero energy supplies. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey told the BBC: \"We are super-committed to fast-tracking action on net zero, not least because it could both reduce people's energy bills and make the UK more energy independent.\"\nPlaid Cymru described Labour's plan as \"unambitious\" and \"re-hashed\". Labour first announced its plan to create the Great British Energy company in September 2022.",

    "Campaigners have said a new NHS dental plan was \"fundamentally flawed\".\nToothless in England has criticised the Improving Oral Health in SNEE: ICB Dental Plan by Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board (SNEE ICB).\nMark Jones, the campaign's spokesman, said the strategy was \"underdeveloped and lacks real evidence\".\nSNEE ICB said the plan had been developed with \"local dental leaders\" who have advised it on how to improve access to NHS dental care.\nThe strategy would include promoting oral health amongst children in early years, supporting the recruitment and development of dental staff, and flexible contracts for dental practices.\nUnder the scheme, 20 practices across the two counties have already been commissioned to increase their opening hours and provide additional NHS sessions to priority groups, including children in care, the homeless, those with learning disabilities and refugees.\nPeter Wightman, the executive director lead for dental commissioning at SNEE ICB, said the plan was \"really ambitious\".\n\"We're trying to achieve roughly a 10% growth in dental activity over the next three years and that will get us back to fully deploying every NHS pound in the NHS dental market,\" he continued.\nDespite this, Mr Jones said the board had rejected campaigners' advice given over 18 months of engagement between the two organisations.\n\"We cannot, in all honesty, endorse the approach they're choosing to take,\" he said.\nToothless for England was founded in 2021 after the only NHS dental practices in Leiston, Suffolk, closed.\nThe group have called for reforms to NHS dental contracts and free dental treatments.\nMr Jones continued: \"SNEE's strategy is underdeveloped and lacks any real evidence suggesting that patients will be better provided for in the future.\n\"It offers no hope for those suffering in pain right now, nor does it make any great strides towards procuring mobile dental clinics to treat underserved rural and coastal communities, something we've called for from day one.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Ministers are facing calls to prevent leaseholders being threatened with losing their home over unpaid charges.\nUnder current laws, branded \"draconian\" by campaigners, a property can be repossessed if the leaseholder owes as little as \u00c2\u00a3350.\nThere is cross-party support for scrapping the practice of forfeiture in the Leasehold Reform Bill, which returns to the Lords on Wednesday.\nThe government says it recognises the issue needs to be tackled.\nLast month, Housing Secretary Michael Gove said forfeiture was \"wrong\" and ministers would work with other parties in the Lords to find the best way of addressing this.\nThe Leasehold Bill, which is making its way through Parliament, would ban the creation of new leasehold houses in England and Wales, and make it easier for leaseholders to buy their freehold.\nUnder the current system, leaseholders often have to pay ground rent to a freeholder, as well as service charges to maintain the building.\nA freeholder can apply to repossess a property if there is a breach of the lease, for example not paying the ground rent or service charge.\nThere are some protections for leaseholders. For example, if an alleged breach is not agreed by the leaseholder, the landlord has to apply to a tribunal or court to determine the breach before they can start forfeiture action.\nHowever, campaigners say the threat of losing their home can be enough to persuade many leaseholders to pay up before the legal process is formally under way, even if they believe charges are unreasonable.\nLouis Chadwick and his wife Daniela Marinova were threatened with forfeiture when they refused to pay the full service charge for their flat, which Mr Chadwick said had escalated to an \"extortionate\" level.\nThe couple bought the flat in Croydon, south London, in his wife's name in 2017.\nBy 2022 their service charge had increased to more than \u00c2\u00a34,400 a year, up from around \u00c2\u00a33,200 the previous year.\nThe figure was also more than 60% higher than had been estimated at the start of the year.\nMr Chadwick said the building, which is a house converted into five flats, did not require extensive maintenance beyond things like basic gardening and painting.\nThe couple are in the process of challenging their service charge at a tribunal, but the case has not yet been heard.\nThey claim their managing agent has been slow to provide invoices for work and in some cases has failed to give evidence it has been carried out. They also argue expensive extra works have been added on top of their estimated charges for the year, which they believe are unnecessary.\nTheir managing agent, Eagerstates, disputes this, and said it readily provides invoices and supporting evidence.\nThe company said the service charge was based on actual expenses and extra regulations meant additional work was needed to ensure the property was compliant.\n'It's been horrendous'\nAt the time they were threatened with forfeiture, Mr Chadwick's wife was pregnant.\nTheir son was born prematurely and diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy, a serious genetic condition.\nMr Chadwick said the stress of the legal dispute over their flat \"certainly didn't help the situation\".\n\"It's just been horrendous,\" he said. \"My wife was at breaking point.\"\nThe couple are currently abroad as their son is receiving treatment in Bulgaria, where he was born. However, if they decide to sell the flat, they are worried they may struggle because of the high service charges.\nThe Leasehold Knowledge Partnership charity advises leaseholders should always pay any charges first and dispute them after.\nHowever, Mr Chadwick said he was concerned that if they paid the service charge in full, they would never get the money back.\n\"I'm not giving up now,\" he said. \"I will keep fighting until all my appeals have run out.\"\nEagerstates said: \"We would only engage any debt collectors or solicitors after all other avenues have been exhausted. We have given the leaseholder every chance to clear the bill before doing so.\"\nThe company said it did not take the decision \"lightly\", but it needed to recover the amounts \"to ensure the running of the building\".\n'Obscene'\nHarry Scoffin, who founded campaign group Free Leaseholders, said the idea someone could lose a flat worth \u00c2\u00a3350,000 for a debt as small as \u00c2\u00a3350 was \"obscene\".\nHe argued there was already a mechanism to claim back unpaid service charge through the county courts.\nThe Residential Freehold Association said it supported the reform of forfeiture to prevent landlords making \"a windfall profit\".\nThe association said its members \"never want to use forfeiture to repossess a property, and hardly ever do\".\nHowever, a spokesman said the threat of forfeiture was necessary \"to prevent serious lease breaches\" and ensure funds were available to run buildings.\nKatie Kendrick, co-founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, said the number of forfeiture cases which make it to court was relatively low, but it was used daily as a threat to get leaseholders to pay \"unreasona",

    "There has been a huge outpouring of love and support for the Princess of Wales after she revealed she was being treated for cancer.\nIn a video statement , Catherine said her diagnosis had come as a \"huge shock\" and that she had been receiving chemotherapy since late February.\nCancer charities have praised her openness, while world leaders, friends and celebrities have wished her well.\nThe news has also led to calls for her and her family to be given privacy.\nIn an emotional message on Friday, Catherine explained that when she had had abdominal surgery in January, it was not known that there was any cancer, but subsequent tests \"found cancer had been present\".\nShe said it had been an \"incredibly tough couple of months\" for her family but she was feeling \"well and getting stronger every day\".\nCatherine also said she and Prince William had taken time to sensitively share the state of her health with their children.\nKensington Palace has not disclosed the type of cancer Catherine has been diagnosed with, but says it is confident she will make a full recovery.\nKing Charles III - who was recently diagnosed with cancer himself - said he was \"so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did\".\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla, who had already been informed about the princess's health, said they would \"continue to offer their love and support to the whole family through this difficult time\".\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are understood to have reached out privately to the Prince and Princess of Wales following the announcement.\nThey also released a statement saying they wished Catherine \"health and healing\", and hoped her and her family could heal \"privately and in peace\".\nOthers have also called for her to be given space and privacy to recover, including actor Jamie Lee Curtis and TV presenter Davina McCall.\nWhile X CEO Linda Yaccarino said the princess's request for privacy seemed like \"a reasonable request to respect\".\nMembers of the public have also been sharing messages of sympathy with the princess.\nKarl from Yorkshire, told BBC Radio 5 Live he wished Catherine the very best. He said he had been diagnosed with cancer two years ago and that telling his three adult children had been \"one of the toughest things\" he had ever done.\nHe said he had not yet told his six-year-old daughter because \"I don't look ill\", adding he did not \"envy Kate who doesn't have the luxury of anonymity like me\".\nRod Laight, chairman of trustees of the Primrose Hospice in Bromsgrove, said many families would find comfort from Catherine and her words.\n\"What Princess Kate has achieved will have unbelievable positive effects on the future of everyone involved in cancer care,\" he added.\nEve Watts, who lives in Windsor, said the news was a \"shock because she's so young\". She added: \"It just shows you it could happen to anyone.\"\nAnd Ms Watts' mother Valerie, who was visiting the historic town from Southport, said she hoped Catherine's video would \"end all the speculation that's been going on\".\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday that Catherine had shown \"tremendous bravery\" in the face of \"intense scrutiny\".\nHe added: \"When it comes to matters of health, like everyone else, she must be afforded the privacy to focus on her treatment and be with her loving family.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his thoughts were with the Royal Family, and that he was heartened by the princess's optimism and \"message of faith and hope\".\nIn her video statement, the princess said she was thinking of all those who have been affected by cancer, adding: \"For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone.\"\nMessages of support have also been pouring in from across the world.\nUS President Joe Biden said he was joining \"millions\" in praying for Catherine's \"full recovery\", while his wife Jill Biden described the princess as \"brave\".\nAnd French President Emmanuel Macron said the princess's \"strength and resilience inspire us all\".\nCatherine and the Prince of Wales are not expected to appear with the Royal Family on Easter Sunday. There will not be any early return to official duties for the princess either.\nKensington Palace has also said Prince William's sudden absence from a memorial service on 27 February was because of the discovery of Catherine's cancer diagnosis.\nWhile Catherine has stood back from royal duties, Charles has continued with his constitutional role as head of state, and was recently seen in a virtual address to a service celebrating Commonwealth Day .\nYou can watch a BBC News special programme about how the Princess of Wales revealed her cancer diagnosis in a video message to the nation - 'Kate's Cancer diagnosis' - on BBC iPlayer, now.",
    "Markus Jooste, the former head of the Steinhoff retail group that was at the centre of a huge corporate fraud case in South Africa, has died.\nPolice said Mr Jooste succumbed to a gunshot wound in hospital, with local media reporting he shot himself at his home in the southern town of Hermanus.\n\"The circumstances surrounding his death are being investigated,\" police spokesperson Andre Traut said.\nThe Steinhoff group had included European retailers such as the UK's Poundland.\nLocal media says Mr Jooste once had a \"near-mythical\" reputation as an exceptional businessman , credited with turning the small Johannesburg furniture-seller Steinhoff into a multinational retailer.\nNews of the 63-year-old's death came a day after he was ordered to pay a $25m (\u00c2\u00a320m) fine - said to be the biggest in South Africa's history.\nOn Friday, police said he had been notified that an arrest warrant had been issued against him shortly before he died.\nThe country's financial regulator said Mr Jooste had played a role in the publishing of misleading financial statements about Steinhoff International Holdings.\nFake transactions worth $6.5bn were made by Steinhoff executives in order to inflate profits, an audit by PwC found.\nClose to 98% of Steinhoff's share value was wiped out in 2017, when the accounting scandal first broke. Those heavy losses also affected investors in South African pension funds.\nMr Jooste resigned as chief executive, but denied any knowledge of accounting fraud. He was also later fined for insider trading in 2020.\nSteinhoff International Holdings is based in South Africa but also listed in Germany's financial capital of Frankfurt.\nAfter Mr Jooste's no-show at a trial in Germany last April, a German court issued a warrant for his arrest in June.",

    "Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Shohei Ohtani says he is \"beyond shocked\" that his translator allegedly stole his money for illegal sports betting.\nThe Japanese baseball star's long-time interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers last week after allegations of theft connected to illegal gambling.\nOhtani said he was \"very saddened\" that \"someone who I trusted has done this\".\nThe two-time Major League Baseball MVP is not accused of any wrongdoing.\nOhtani's legal representatives have accused Mr Mizuhara of \"massive theft\". The Internal Revenue Service is conducting a criminal investigation, while the US baseball league is also carrying out a probe.\nThe baseball star read a prepared statement to reporters on Monday, as he attempted to clarify the controversy surrounding his translator and close companion.\nOhtani said he had never participated in sports betting and was not aware Mr Mizuhara was funnelling millions of dollars from the baseball player's bank account to pay off the translator's debts.\nAccording to ESPN, at least $4.5m (\u00c2\u00a33.5m) was transferred from Ohtani's bank account to a bookmaker.\nSports betting is legal in 38 states in America but it remains illegal in California. The MLB has its own rules against sports betting as well.\nMonday's news conference came after Ohtani's translator initially told ESPN that he had asked the baseball star for help with his gambling debts and Ohtani had agreed.\n\"Obviously, [Ohtani] wasn't happy about it and said he would help me out to make sure I never do this again,\" Mr Mizuhara told the outlet.\nAt first, representatives for Ohtani backed up this claim to the media, but later retracted the statement when Mr Mizuhara was fired.\nThe baseball player said on Monday that \"all of this has been a complete lie\".\nOhtani added that Mr Mizuhara had not told him of reporters' questions about the scandal and that the translator lied to Ohtani's representatives, telling them the Japanese baseball star had in fact agreed to pay off his debts.\nThe star pitcher said Mr Mizuhara first told him about his gambling problem after the Dodgers' season opener in South Korea last week. Mr Mizuhara asked him to meet one-on-one, telling him about his \"massive debt\". Ohtani said.\n\"I never agreed to pay off the debt or make payments to the bookmaker,\" Ohtani said via the translator.\nOhtani said he had referred the matter to his lawyers, who would handle the situation while he focused on the upcoming season.\nMr Ohtani started his stint in the US in 2018, and Mr Mizuhara has been his constant companion since.\nBut the translator's record has come under scrutiny in light of the scandal.\nThe University of California, Riverside released a statement saying they had no record of Mr Mizuhara ever attending the university, despite what the translator included in his public biography.\nAnd the Boston Red Sox said Mr Mizuhara was never employed as an interpreter by the franchise, although news reports and a Los Angeles Angels media guide had said so.\nLos Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said earlier this week he supported Ohtani's decision to address the controversy.\n\"I'm happy he's going to speak and speak to what he knows and give his thoughts on the whole situation,\" he told a news conference on Sunday.\nOhtani played last week in front of a sell-out crowd during a two-game series between the LA Dodgers and San Diego Padres in Seoul, South Korea.\nLast December, Ohtani signed a record 10-year, $700m contract with the Dodgers, becoming the face of the sports franchise.",

Next up is a busy summer schedule set to take them around Europe.\nWhile Symmetrik's social media suggests they are living a non-stop party, the guys are quick to stress this is not the case.\nThe pair said they do not have many days off. The vast majority of their time is spent in their home studio producing music.\n\"Back in the day it would have just been DJing and mixing tracks but with social media we need to perfect our content, make your own music, and make it sound as original as possible,\" said Curtis.\n\"There's so much out there these days, you need to stand out.\"\nThey, and others from Northern Ireland, are doing a very good job of that.\nSo why has dance music seemingly struck such a chord with so many young people in Northern Ireland again?\nDavid said a big factor could be that the genre provides a shared space for people from all backgrounds.\n\"Whenever people come together, they club, they're united as one. There's something special about it [the dance music scene] here,\" he explained.\nDance music is a safe place - Holly Lester\nThe village of Hamiltonsbawn in County Armagh is not famed for its dance music scene. But it did produce a dynamic and acclaimed DJ called Holly Lester.\nShe began learning to beat match house records aged 14 and knew instantly she was hooked, describing dance music as a \"safe place\".\nHolly said it was about her and others finding their \"non-blood family\".\nPlenty of success has since followed. Holly has been a DJ internationally for a number of years, but, after a period living away, she has settled back in Northern Ireland where her focus remains on the local nightlife industry.\nIt is one, she said, that is not ideal for budding DJs and producers.\nHolly is a co-founder of Free the Night, a non-profit organisation aimed at boosting the night-time economy.\n\"There is an incredible amount of talent from Northern Ireland, for such a small place,\" she said, adding the challenges are wide-reaching..\n\"The way the licencing system operates in this country, to the lack of transport infrastructure at night, to the lack of venue spaces, to the lack of funding. Just a general lack of understanding.\"\n'Making it in Ibiza was the best move'\nThere is an understanding that, generally, many DJs from Northern Ireland tend to leave to pursue their careers.\nLike Holly, another dance music talent who decided to relocate back home is Strabane native, Lo\u00c3\u00a9ca.\nAfter 15 years living in Ibiza and England, she has recently returned to the north west.\n\"Leaving was a big part of my career. Making it in Ibiza was the best move and the best route for me to have made it,\" she said.\nLo\u00c3\u00a9ca remains signed to Defected Records - one of the biggest labels in dance music. She still DJs around the world but also has plans for make her mark locally.\n\"Opportunities are quite limited here so I personally want to get involved with creating my own night,\" she said.\nShe explained this would be \"to shine talent on people from here and then smaller talent from all around the world\".\nLo\u00c3\u00a9ca concedes that it's much tougher to start a regular dance night in Northern Ireland because of the smaller customer base, but her optimism remains undented.\nNorthern Ireland artists have the global dance music scene well covered.\nThe challenge now is turning that international success into an increasingly supportive and sustainable movement for the next generation of local DJs.",

It puts up to 100 players against each other in a fight to be the last one standing.\nShe told the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme:\"I just happened to go into his room and was rather intrigued by what I saw on the screen. That really was the beginning of it.\"\nShe practiced in solo games for three years before joining \"squads\" in streamed games.\nBut she didn't like some of the \"toxic\" language used by younger gamers - so set up her own teams of older players.\nCath said: \"We don't use the word kill - we use the word eliminate. So it's not gory and you don't see anyone lying on the ground with blood. They're quite tasteful and I like that.\n\"When I started streaming, I wanted to have squads and I didn't really have anyone that I could play with.\n\"When I went to play with random squads, I really didn't like what I was hearing - it was quite toxic.\n\"So I decided that if I streamed, I would choose the folk that I played with - never, ever realising it would take off like this.\"\nThings really took off after Grumpygran1948 was spotted online by superstar gamer SypherPK.\nThe pair hit it off - and Cath even ended up singing the traditional Scottish children's song, Ye Cannae Shove Yer Granny Aff A Bus , to him.\nCath said: \"He'd obviously watched me and thought it might be amusing if he took me in to play with him - creating opportunities for the elderly folk.\n\"So he just came into my stream and asked me if I wanted to do a duel with him.\n\"I said yes and took a friend who comes from America with me, just to balance it up. We had three games with him and it was absolutely fantastic.\nFamily life\nShe added: \"Anybody who plays Fortnite knows SypherPK and I had absolutely thousands of viewers that day and the next couple of days.\n\"I'm glad to say it has quietened down a bit now.\"\nCath insists she won't let her new-found gaming fame go to her head or get in the way of family life, with her husband happy for her to indulge in her nightly hobby.\n\"I wouldn't say I'm famous. I am known but maybe I shouldn't put myself on a pedestal,\" she said.\n\"I never let it intrude on my personal life. It's always when everybody else will be winding down their day - maybe they will be watching TV or something like that - and then I go on to Fortnite.\"",

    "A family from Devon has spoken of their battle to find an affordable home and the reality of council-funded emergency housing.\nCharlotte Cheshire, mother to 16-month-old Sydney, said they had moved six times since leaving their rental in October 2023.\nShe said a North Devon Council (NDC) review deemed her \"intentionally homeless\" but she refuted this.\nThe council said it could not comment on individual cases.\nIt said housing officers \"continue to work with those who may have been found to be intentionally homeless with advice and information in securing alternative accommodation\".\nMs Cheshire, 29, has shared her experiences of living in temporary accommodation in diary entries for the BBC.\nIn her account, she detailed how she moved six times after leaving a previous rental which she claims she had to leave while repairs were carried out in October 2023 - first into a series of placements organised by NDC before sofa-surfing at her grandmother's and her partner's family.\nShe said the stress of the situation had caused hair loss and she now wears a wig.\n\"I wouldn't wish this on anybody - this has been the worst year of my life,\" she said.\n\"People say: 'You'll find somewhere soon,' but I'm not sure they realise how the feeling of instability affects you, especially with a young child.\"\n'I felt scared' - a mum's diary entries\nThe rental\n\"I was living in Barnstaple in a flat with my partner, a plumbing and maintenance engineer and our baby Sydney.\n\"I was on maternity from my job at a toyshop when we had to move out of our rental and contacted the council for help and advice because we couldn't find somewhere else we could afford.\n\"We were due to leave on October 20 2023.\n\"The council said we could go to a B&B in Ilfracombe, with one bedroom and a shared fridge.\"\nThe B&B\n\"We moved into the B&B in Ilfracombe in October 2023, there were cameras everywhere, the stairs were so steep I needed help with Sydney's pram.\n\"Sydney had nowhere to play, we were all sitting in our beds, eating microwave meals. It was not suitable for a child.\n\"I was signed off work with stress and the house hunt continued.\n\"I ended up quitting my job, I couldn't work it to get Sydney to nursery and me to work because we were in Ilfracombe.\n\"My hair started falling out with the stress, I shaved it and started wearing a wig.\n\"On 12 November, we were placed at a holiday park.\"\nThe holiday park\n\"It was so uncertain - we didn't know if the council was going to come and kick us out.\n\"There were three flights of stairs with Sydney's pram and a no visitors rule means I felt so lonely a lot of the time.\n\"We keep looking for rentals.

    "Saul Wordsworth remembers when he first realised his father Christopher may have taken a terrible secret to his grave.\nHe knew all about his quick temper and explosive outbursts of rage, but a set of his diaries inherited by Saul hinted at something altogether darker.\n\"I think he might have killed somebody,\" is what Saul, a writer, remembers being told by the woman transcribing them.\nThe passage she highlighted referred to hiding a body until a search party had gone.\nA smoking gun? Saul was not convinced. To him, it appeared fictional.\nGrowing up in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, he knew his father as a teller of tall tales whose own back story was shrouded in mystery.\nAn acclaimed literary critic and sports writer for The Observer and The Guardian, Christopher was also a frustrated novelist whose lifelong ambition tantalised, tortured and ultimately eluded him.\nHints at a decades-old dark secret, therefore, did not seem fanciful to Saul, but were definitely intriguing.\nThere were other potentially incriminating lines. One read: \"It is that element of calculation in it that shames me and makes it murder.\"\nSaul, 51, reasoned that had his father really murdered somebody, he would not have risked writing it down. But could he have killed someone unintentionally?\nArmed with the diaries, Saul, who lives in north London, began disentangling fact from fiction for a six-part podcast series, Devil in the Wilderness , for which he also composed the soundtrack.\nTracking down elderly friends, relatives and former colleagues of his father, he built a picture of a brilliant but troubled man with a chaotic and disturbing past.\n\"I hope you come out of the podcast all right, Dad, but either way, forgive me,\" he says, in the first episode.\nBorn in Kolkata in 1914, Christopher drifted for decades before entering journalism aged 50.\nHis flair for words saw him dubbed \"Fleet Street's prince of phrase-makers\", credited by some with coining the famous saying \"legend in his own lunchtime\" .\nHe died in 1998, aged 83, in his favourite chair, a review copy of a book beside him.\nHis own long-promised novel remained unwritten.\nChristopher was 57 when Saul, the only child of his third marriage, was born.\nThe pair's relationship was often fractious. Sometimes kind and very funny, Christopher was also prone to terrifying anger.\n\"Everything was turned up to 11,\" says Saul.\nHe also became a vessel for his father's thwarted ambitions. \"Saul, I live through you,\" he would often tell him.\nLater, when his own mental health suffered, Saul realised the burden this had been.\nThe pair bonded over a shared love of sport, but Christopher remained enigmatic.\n\"He was a bit of a fabricator of lots of things, not least his own life,\" says Saul.\n\"There was something about him that was mysterious and unknowable, and he liked it that way.\"\nHis father's tall stories included the bizarre claim that Hitler was still alive.\nThis unnerved Saul but ultimately inspired his comic novel Alan Stoob: Nazi Hunter .\nIn seeing it published, Saul achieved something his father never managed.\nChristopher's diaries date from 1953 to 1963, when he was divorced, penniless and living on trout and potatoes in a remote cottage in the wilds of north Wales, suffering writers' block.\nSaul had known of the diaries for years but had never seen them, imagining them \"distantly glowing\" in a trunk in his father's study.\nWhen they finally came his way, carefully wrapped in polythene, Saul sensed they were \"precious cargo\".\nEach time he tried to read them, though, he was defeated by his father's handwriting, so he recruited a transcriber called Emma to help.\nOpening the first of five battered volumes, she inhaled its musty aroma, telling Saul: \"I can do this. If you're happy with the first one, I'll transcribe the other four for you.\"\nA week later, a full transcript of the first diary, dated 1953, arrived.\nChristopher's words reveal a man at a low ebb. \"I have arrived in my late 30s as nearly naked as is possible for a man to be, in the practical worldly sense,\" he writes.\n\"Money, shelter, reputation, friends, relatives, useful acquaintances, achievements, I have none. It would have been impossible to have devised a more complete downfall in fiction.\"\nOver the next six weeks, four more documents arrived, totalling nearly 60,000 words.\n\"I wasn't shocked by the quality of the writing, but I was blown away by the sheer weight of purple prose, and just the shimmering wondrousness of my dad's ability with the written word,\" says Saul.\n\"But all the while he's lacerating and battering himself about not being able to write, because, for him, writing only meant writing the novel.\"\nSaul learned that, aged three, his father was left with a relative in Oswestry, Shropshire, while his parents returned to India.\nLater came boarding school and an abortive spell at Oxford University.\nChristopher also burned through a large inheritance and was reduced to begging from friends and family.\nHe even tried to sell hi",
    "Rowers taking part in the 2024 Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge in London are among those that have been told not to enter the Thames after high levels of E. coli were found.\nCrews have also been warned to cover blisters, and wear footwear when getting in and out of the boat.\nPressure group River Action said tests indicated the bacteria came from sewage directly discharged into the river.\nThames Water said improving river health was a \"key focus\" for the firm.\nRowers from both Oxford and Cambridge universities will take to the iconic 4.25-mile Championship Course on the Thames on Saturday afternoon, the 169th men's and 78th women's races.\nRiver Action chief executive James Wallace said: \"It is a tragic situation when elite athletes are issued with health guidance ahead of a historic race on the capital's river.\n\"Our water quality results show what happens after decades of neglect by an unregulated water company, Thames Water.\"\nThe E. coli bacterium, which is found in faeces, can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infections, cystitis, intestinal infections and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning.\nRiver Action, British Rowing and The Rivers Trust say they are asking the government to enforce the law and prosecute polluters.\nThey have issued new guidance to rowing clubs on safety in polluted waters, which has been included in the Boat Race briefing packs to both universities.\nSample information\nThe bacteria was discovered between 28 February and 26 March, using a World Health Organization-verified E. coli analyser.\nThe 16 tests around Hammersmith Bridge, in west London, indicated an average of 2,869 E. coli colony-forming units (CFU) per 100ml of water.\nTo meet the Environment Agency's inland bathing water quality standards, the level should be below 1,000 CFU per 100ml.\nRiver Action said the highest level it recorded was 9,801 CFU per 100ml, meaning it was nearly 10 times higher than levels found in bathing waters graded as \"poor\" by Environment Agency standards.\nThis is based on publicly available data that showed the water company had discharged sewage into the Greater London area of the River Thames for 1,914 hours from the start of 2024 up to 26 March.\nOrganisers of the Boat Race have said the universities involved \"love\" rowing on the Thames but water quality was an \"ongoing concern\".\n\"The Tideway especially is a unique stretch of water that tests the technical skill and resilience of the rowers like few others can.\n\"Water quality is an ongoing concern for the Boat Race and we carry out numerous briefings with the universities and athletes to ensure they are as safe as possible when rowing on the Tideway.\n\"We regularly consult with our extensive network of rowing clubs on health and safety guidelines and we have put in place a series of precautionary measures this year to protect the health of our athletes.\"\nThey added this included \"guidance regarding the covering up of open wounds, regular handwashing, a cleansing station at the finish area and highlighting the risks of entering the water\".\nIn a statement, Thames Water said: \"We have experienced higher than average long-term rainfall across London and the Thames Valley with groundwater levels exceptionally high for the time of the year.\n\"The overflows are designed to operate automatically when the sewer network is about to be overwhelmed, which then releases diluted wastewater into rivers, rather than letting it back up into people's homes.\n\"We are working hard to make these discharges unnecessary and have published plans to upgrade over 250 of our sites.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Almost all of the front pages have more coverage of the cancer announcement by Catherine, Princess of Wales. One of her close friends has told The Sunday Times that she felt a video statement of her diagnosis would be the \"most compassionate way\" to deliver the news, believing a written statement would be \"too jarring\". According to royal sources in The Sunday Telegraph, the Prince of Wales is \"extremely proud\" of the \"courage and strength\" shown by his wife. The Sun on Sunday reports that the princess had a \"heart-to-heart\" over lunch with her father-in-law, King Charles III, a day before the video was released. Insiders have told the paper that the King left the meeting at Windsor Castle feeling \"emotional\".\nThe Sunday Express is among those to report that the Princess of Wales boarded a helicopter with her family on Saturday to go on a \"much needed break\". According to The Sunday Mirror it is believed they were heading to Amner Hall - their home in Norfolk. The Mail on Sunday says the family are known for revelling in outdoorsy activities there including walking and cycling. The paper suggests that, if well enough, Catherine may persuade her children to indulge her love of cold-water swimming.\nThe Princess of Wales's diagnosis is, according to a report in The Sunday Telegraph, part of an epidemic of people getting cancer aged under 50. The paper says there is now a \"scramble to establish the trend\". Speaking to The Observer, a cancer expert, Professor Andrew Beggs, says the rise could be down to doctors getting better at spotting the condition and younger people being more perceptive about their health than previous generations.\nAnalysis by The Sunday Times suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"no easy options\" when considering how to respond to the mass shooting at a concert near Moscow. The paper says he is likely to crack down on Central Asian militants. But according to the paper, many of them are needed to do the jobs Russians do not want to do. Any \"thuggish repression\", it says, could force many Central Asians to leave.\nThe Observer leads on \"shocking new evidence\" that suggests French maritime police have tried physically to force small boats in the Channel to turn around. In one video, a French vessel - bought using funding from the UK - circles a dinghy holding about 25 people, creating a wake that floods the boat. The Prefecture for the North of France said the aim of the intervention was to \"dissuade passengers\" from approaching the open sea. All the migrants were recovered and the smugglers arrested.\nFinally, The Mail on Sunday reports on an ironing board on sale for almost \u00c2\u00a34,000. \"Talk about the cost of living in-creases\", it quips. While shoppers may be expecting some \"super smart accessories\", The Mail says the Laurastar x Germanier Ironing System comes only with an in-built water tank. There is praise for the board looking like a \"work of art\" with its hand-stitched cover but one Harrods shopper remains unimpressed, suggesting it is more akin to a spaceship.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

    "Doctors in Scotland's busiest emergency department have told hospital bosses they have no confidence in them dealing with growing patient safety concerns.\nA total of 27 A&E consultants at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) wrote a letter of no confidence in the NHS Lothian executive board last year.\nThe doctors claimed they \"currently cannot deliver safe, effective timely care for our patients\".\nNHS Lothian said it is working with them on a plan to improve the service.\nNews of the letter comes as A&E consultants at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) and in NHS Grampian have been raising similar concerns about patient safety .\nThey are calling for a Scotland-wide review of emergency treatment provision.\nIn May last year Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) published an inspection report warning the RIE emergency department was at times operating at 300% of its capacity .\nThe safety watchdog found \"multiple systemic failures\" over two visits to the A&E.\nThe following month, 27 emergency department consultants signed a letter to Prof John Connaghan, NHS Lothian's chairman, to state their \"loss of confidence\" in the board's executives to deal with \"sustained and worsening patient safety issues\" raised over the three previous years.\nThe letter stated: \"We are trained to provide emergency and urgent care in the first hours after attendance, not for protracted periods of time beyond 12 hours and into days.\"\nThe consultants pointed out there was a 80% increase in their workload during 2022 and the increased pressure on the A&E was \"disproportionate\" compared to other departments at the hospital.\nThe doctors warn that if things continue as they are then \"significant patient morbidity and mortality will continue to occur\".\nProf Connaghan and senior executives met with the consultants after receiving their letter and NHS Lothian said they agreed improvement actions.\nThe emergency department at the RIE, which opened in 2003, was built to accommodate up to 90,000 attendances per year but is now dealing with 135,000 per year.\nThe types of concerns raised about the RIE emergency department have been raised by doctors around Scotland in recent years.\nNearly every A&E consultant at Glasgow's QEUH wrote to Healthcare Improvement Scotland to warn patient safety was being \"seriously compromised\".\nThey offered 18 months' worth of evidence of overcrowding and staff shortages to back their claims which were not initially fully investigated by the watchdog.\nElsewhere, in August last year a group of senior doctors accused NHS Grampian of ignoring their safety concerns about emergency departments in Elgin and Aberdeen.\n'Significant pressure'\nMichelle Carr, chief officer of acute services at NHS Lothian, said it takes staff concerns \"extremely seriously\" and is working through an improvement plan for the emergency department in conjunction with the consultants.\nShe added: \"NHS Lothian, like all other health boards in Scotland, remains under significant pressure. Our hospitals are experiencing high numbers of patients, as well as increase in trauma cases and acuity of illness.\n\"Overall occupancy remains high and we are working with teams throughout the hospital and in Health and Social Partnerships to ensure patients continue to receive safe, effective and timeous care, and flow back into the community as soon as they are well enough to do so.\nThe health executive also pointed out the \"RIE is the busiest and largest hospital in NHS Lothian as well as one of the major trauma centres for some of the sickest and most seriously injured patients in south-east Scotland.\"",

    "The announcement from the Princess of Wales that she has cancer has sent shockwaves around the world, not least in Norfolk. She and her young family have a home at Anmer, near Sandringham. The BBC visited the estate to hear what people made of the news.\n'She is a mum, a normal human being'\nBeth Argent, 25, said she felt Catherine's decision to tell the world of her cancer diagnosis had been taken out of her hands.\n\"I feel social media forced her to make a statement when she didn't really want to,\" said Ms Argent, of Weasenham, near Fakenham.\n\"She should have had her own time and her privacy with her family to go through her treatment and to recover.\n\"It's social media's fault for making up rumours and forcing her to come out with such a personal statement when it should be private.\n\"I feel it would have come out a lot later, after maybe her treatment and after she gets herself better.\n\"She looks amazing but you can definitely tell that she is quite poorly, and it was a shock to her.\"\nAsked if, as a member of the Royal Family, the princess should be allowed to keep health matters private, Ms Argent said she should be afforded the same respect as anyone else.\n\"She is a mum, she is a normal human being, she is someone's wife, someone's daughter.\n\"She should just do normal things, as we do.

    "As news of the Moscow concert hall attack broke on Friday, Ukrainians knew what was coming: Kyiv would be blamed.\nThe next thing they expected was more drones and more missiles.\nThe accusations began almost immediately.\nThey were just hints at first, until President Vladimir Putin openly claimed that the men who attacked Moscow had tried to flee to Ukraine, helped by contacts there.\nThen shortly before dawn on Sunday came the sound of explosions in Kyiv.\nWhen Mr Putin made his comments on Saturday in an address to the Russian nation, Islamic State group (IS) extremists had already announced they had carried out the killings.\nThe US had confirmed that it passed on intelligence of a threat earlier this month.\nNow IS have released a hideously graphic video of their massacre, filmed on bodycams and including shouts of \"God is Greatest\" from the attackers.\nIn his evening statement on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was visibly angry that his country was being blamed.\nHe described the Russian president and others in Moscow as \"scum\" for linking the attack there to Kyiv.\nHe suggested a \"miserable\" Russian leader was more concerned about pinning the attack on Kyiv than reassuring his own citizens.\nMr Zelensky then turned the tables on Moscow, saying it had sent \"hundreds of thousands of [its own] terrorists\" to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.\nHe said those troops were now brutalising Ukraine, instead of protecting Russia against the real threat of extremism.\n\"They burn our cities\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 they torture and rape.\"\nUkrainian police have opened thousands of criminal cases against Russian soldiers since February 2022, including one killing we investigated where two unarmed civilians were shot in the back .\nEarlier on Saturday, the military intelligence directorate in Kyiv called the specific Russian claim that the gunmen were caught trying to flee across the Ukrainian border \"absurd\".\nIt is an active front line teeming with Russian soldiers and security services.\nThe idea anyone would head there after staging a major attack on Moscow, Andriy Yusov argued, would be either \"suicidal\" or \"stupid\".\nAccording to Russian officials, the suspects were captured in the Bryansk region on their way west to Ukraine. If that is genuinely where their car was stopped - and we do not know that -  they could have been heading for Belarus.\nIt is a far easier route out of Russia than crossing a minefield to get to Ukraine.\nVideos now circulating on social media show the detention of the suspected attackers and part of their interrogation. One shows a Russian agent trying to force a man to eat a piece of his own ear which has been severed. He spits it out.\nIn another video his head is bandaged and face covered in blood. Any confessions that emerge after such torture could not be treated as reliable.\nThe video clips were presumably released to showcase a tough response, but that follows an attack which the same security services failed to stop or see coming.\nSo in his address, Mr Zelensky suggested Russians ask questions of their own intelligence agencies, rather than blaming Ukraine.\nThat would include asking whether information from the US was ignored.\nBut Putin's Russia has been purged of political opposition and independent media, leaving no-one to really hold the authorities to account.\nIn his address, Ukraine's president also alluded to a dark theory raised earlier by his military intelligence agency - that the Russian authorities themselves were linked to the Moscow attack.\nThe supposed motive was to bolster Mr Putin's hold on power, rally support for his war and further mobilisation.\nThe comments hark back to long-standing suspicions in Russia over the bombing of apartment blocks in 1999 that was the trigger for Vladimir Putin - who was prime minister at the time - to launch a war on the Chechen Republic.\nBut Russia and Ukraine are engaged in an information war as well as fighting on the battlefield. The IS video and claim it carried out the attack would cut across Kyiv's allegations just like it did the accusations from Moscow.\nSunday morning's missile launches targeting Ukraine feel like Russia's war as usual, rather than any escalation in response to the Crocus City Hall attack - yet.\nBefore dawn on Sunday there were also reports of Ukrainian strikes on Crimea - the peninsula Russia annexed illegally from Ukraine in 2014.\nIt takes time to prepare a large-scale missile strike, and this is the second by Russia since early on Friday.\nThe major city of Kharkiv is still largely without power after the attack that day targeted energy infrastructure all over the country.\nUkraine is certainly braced for worse after all the rhetoric from Moscow.\nBut the Crocus City Hall attack suggests Russia is facing a real and significant danger within its borders - not the fake threat it concocted from Ukraine to justify Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion.\nThat is a worry for the Russian president - a man who hates ",
    "A top government lawyer warned a plan that would have stopped an incinerator being built in Environment Secretary Steve Barclay's constituency for up to a year was unlawful.\nThe BBC has seen a legal note compiled within government after consultation with Sir James Eadie KC, the First Treasury Counsel.\nIt raised \"serious concerns of perceived bias\" over the issue.\nAnd it warned the decision could be vulnerable to a legal challenge.\nThe courts might assert that it had been taken \"on grounds of political advantage, rather than on legitimate policy grounds,\" the note added.\nMr Barclay has been a long time opponent of the proposed development in Wisbech in Cambridgeshire.\nIt would be one of Europe's biggest waste-to-energy incinerators, burning non-recyclable waste in order to generate energy for local industrial use.\nSources claim Mr Barclay was livid at the decision that the incinerator would be built and sufficiently angry that No10 were aware of his fury.\n'Correct procedures'\nThose around the environment secretary deny that he threatened to resign over it.\nHe has been recused from any decision on the matter, and a source in the department said \"the correct procedures were followed\".\nDowning Street would not say when Mr Barclay had been recused - the technical term for being excluded from a legal process.\nClaire Coutinho's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero gave the plant the go-ahead last month, following a recommendation from the Planning Inspectorate.\nBut to move ahead, the scheme also requires a permit from the Environment Agency (EA) a public body sponsored by Mr Barclay's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\nThe legal advice offers a view on what it calls \"the proposal for an urgent direction to the EA to pause permitting applications for up to a year.\"\nIt concludes that this \"would be unlawful because the consultation undertaken with the EA was plainly inadequate. The context of the secretary of state's constituency interests and recent public comments adds powerful exacerbating feature given the perception of bias.\"\nSeparately, officials escalated the matter to the Cabinet Office's ethics unit, which discussed it with Mr Barclay.\n'Political advantage'\nThe government has said the decision will be taken by a junior minister in the department, Mark Spencer.\nThe BBC understands Mr Spencer is due to inform the Environment Agency of his ruling in the coming days.\nThe internal legal note warns ministers of the potential for the decision to be challenged in court.\nIt says that \"it will not escape the notice of potential challengers or the courts\" that the idea to delay permitting applications \"occurred a very short time indeed\" after the decision by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero to grant permission for the Wisbech plant.\n\"The strong impression is, and the allegation in litigation will undoubtedly be,\" the advice states, that any decision not to award a permit to go ahead was taken \"on grounds of political advantage, rather than on legitimate policy grounds.\"\nThe Prime Minister's Official Spokesman said: \"It's not uncommon for ministers to balance their work as a constituency MP with their roles as ministers and there are established processes which support that.\"",

The ball has to hit the floor before it touches any of the walls and then you have to hit it off the wall before it bounces again.\"\nThe sport is played in more than 130 countries and some of the planet's best players have recently arrived in UK for an international tournament.\nTia says she's seen first-hand the rapid growth of the sport - not just in terms of recognition but in terms of participation too.\n\"The amount that it has grown with so many more companies getting involved, wanting to invest in padel courts, which is the biggest thing giving people the access to be able to try it and play it.\"\nTia was introduced to the sport when she was 12 and spent most of her teenage years travelling from her home outside Birmingham to London for training.\nShe'd also regularly fly to Spain after school on a Friday and be back again by Monday morning.\nPadel was invented in Mexico in the late 1960s and has been hugely popular in Spain for decades, but its boom has really come over the past couple of years.\nIt means Tia has travelled to Australia, Egypt and the US for major tournaments.\n\"Being British number one is quite a big thing, most of my friends are at university and whenever I talk about what I'm doing they say: 'Tia you're literally living the dream.'\"\nOff the court, celebrities are starting to post clips of themselves playing on TikTok and Insta reels.\nTia says Stormzy's been at her gym a few times.\n\"It shows how inclusive it is, people want to play it in their downtime,\" she says.\nAnalysts say the growth of the sport is expected to continue and accelerate.\nThe leading professional tour, Premier Padel, has just signed a \"transformational\" partnership with RedBull believed to be worth tens of millions of pounds.\nIn the UK, it can be difficult to find somewhere to play - more than 200 courts have been built to serve about 90,000 active players.\nSome believe padel can be a gateway into tennis, and experts are also predicting it will receive a green light as an Olympic sport in 2032.\n\"I might join those who got the Olympic ring tattoo,\" Tia laughs, but says she won't tell her mum if she does.\nFIP Rise Rocks Lane takes place in Chiswick, London from 27-30 March.\nYou can learn more about the growth of padel, and Tia's story, on Business Daily available on BBC Sounds.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",

    "For the last six years Penson Mlotshwa has been carrying a gun with him wherever he goes in the South African city of Johannesburg. To the shops, restaurants and even the gym.\nHis gun has become an extension of him as the country battles record levels of crime.\n\"I'm not a fortune teller - I never know when I will be attacked,\" the YouTube content creator told the BBC.\n\"Unfortunately, I've had to use my gun multiple times to protect myself,\" he sighs, explaining how a man wanting his wallet pulled a knife on him after dinner one night.\nHe drew his gun and made the mugger hand over the pocket knife, which he threw in the gutter. He did not fire the weapon.\nMr Mlotshwa says his guns - he would not disclose how many he owned - are strictly for protection, a job he feels the police and government have failed dismally at.\nJohannesburg resident Lynette Oxley agrees and says such dangers must be faced head on.\nShe has set up an initiative to train women to protect themselves through gun ownership.\n\"I'd rather buy a new gun, than a pair of shoes,\" the 57-year-old Johannesburg resident, who owns 12 firearms, told the BBC.\nHer organisation, Girls on Fire, mostly helps women who have been raped, attacked, robbed, or experienced some level of violence. The country's rate of sexual violence is among the highest in the world.\nOne woman joined up after her husband was shot in front of her - she was pregnant at the time - and her six-year-old child during a home robbery.\n\"People are realising that we are on our own,\" says Ms Oxley, a gun instructor.\n\"Gun culture in South Africa is about self-defence and necessity.\"\nSouth African law states that most people with a gun licence can carry a firearm if it is concealed.\nThere are more than 2.7 million legal gun owners in South Africa, according to a 2021 survey by Gun Free South Africa (GFSA) - roughly 8% of the adult population.\nWhen it comes to the war against crime, South Africa's police do appear to be losing. The murder rate in the country reached a 20-year high and guns are the weapon of choice.\nAdele Kirsten, the director of GFSA, told the BBC of her concerns that crime was not only increasing in South Africa, but the \"nature of gun violence\" was changing.\nMass shootings and assassinations are becoming a \"feature\" of South Africa, she says.\nLast year the country was rocked when 10 members of the same family were shot dead in an attack on their home near the city of Pietermaritzburg. The youngest victim was only 13 years old.\nMany of these crimes are carried out by illegal firearms - of which there are some 2.35 million in circulation, according to GFSA.\nOne of the sources of these illegal guns is the very institution meant to protect civilians - the police.\nThis was illustrated by the infamous case of ex-police officer Christiaan Prinsloo.\nBetween 2007 and 2015, he sold about 2,000 guns to gangs. These firearms have been linked to more than 1,000 murders and the deaths of 89 children.\nTo fill this security vacuum more people than ever are taking their safety into their own hands.\nIn South Africa for a person to get a gun licence they need to be over the age of 21, go through extensive training, do multiple tests and show proof of mental competency.\nIt can be a long and tedious process.\nDespite this, over the past decade the number of gun-licence applications has quadrupled, according to an investigation by South African news site News24 .\nThis is a big worry for Ms Kirsten, who wants fewer such weapons on the streets: \"When you reduce gun availability, you reduce gun deaths.\"\nGideon Joubert, a firearms consultant, told the BBC that the rise in gun ownership was a natural consequence of the lack of security.\n\"Owning a gun is choosing to be an active participant in your own rescue,\" he says.\nThe 38-year-old, who also is active in the sports shooting sector, says the relationship South Africans have with their firearms is \"complex and multifaceted\".\n\"I see a gun as the ultimate representation of my ability as a free citizen to take the final responsibility for my own safety,\" he says.\nGun culture is influenced by the violent history of the country, which was under white-minority rule until 1994. Black people could not legally obtain guns until 1983.\nEuropean colonisers brought guns to the country in the early 1600s. Afrikaners, white descendants of Dutch settlers, adopted a unique frontier gun-owning identity, that is still present today.\nIn the 1980s the Soviet bloc sent thousands of AK-47s to anti-apartheid groups, and it became a symbol of liberation.\nLegal gun ownership jumped by 40% between 1986 and 1996 at a time of instability and uncertainty in the country, according to a report by GFSA .\nMuch of this was driven by the white minority's fear of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) taking power, the GFSA says.\nThe ANC has now been in power for 30 years - and in elections in May could lose its outright majority in parliament for the first time since apartheid",
    "Arctic foxes are turning to cannibalism as they struggle to find food in a warmer world.\nThat's one of the never-before-captured behaviours in Sir David Attenborough's latest series - Mammals.\nIt focuses on how these animals are adapting to a world rapidly changed by the most dominant mammal - us.\nWe also see otters navigate the busy roads of Singapore and lemurs clinging to toothbrush trees in an attempt to keep cool in rising temperatures.\n'Mammals' is a challenging series to watch but also shows the incredible ingenuity of the world's most successful animals.\nIn the final episode of the six-part series Sir David says: \"If we make the right decisions we can safeguard the future not just for our fellow mammals but for all life on Earth.\"\nThe series comes 20 years on from the original Life of Mammals series. In that time the technology has moved on considerably allowing the BBC's Natural History Unit and its partners to capture sequences they never thought possible.\nThe opening episode of the series has been shot completely in the dark - revealing how an African leopard uses its specially adapted eyesight to prey on sleeping monkeys.\n\"The thermal cameras now are stunning, the detail you can see. You can see the fur, you can see the whiskers of animals, so that technology has opened up that whole new world to us,\" Scott Alexander, series producer, explained.\nTo capture some of the sequences the team have gone to extra lengths. For episode four, 'Cold',  sleeping pods were specially designed so that the camera crew could remain out on the ice in Svalbard, Norway for days at a time tracking a polar bear.\nAs a result the team were able to capture a polar bear hunting reindeer inland - a behaviour they think it has developed as melting sea-ice has made it harder to hunt seals.\nAssistant Professor John Whitman, from Old Dominion University and chief research scientist for Polar Bears International, who provided advice on the series said it: \"illustrates the flexibility that polar bears try to have to replace the loss of opportunities to hunt marine, mammal prey.\"\nBut he added studies have shown that this prey is not enough to replace the calories they need. \"So, the most important action that can be taken to protect the species of polar bears [is] climate change action.\"\nIn the two decades that have passed since the last series, what is also striking is the scale of human expansion. Since 2000 nearly 750,000 sq miles (1.9m sqkm) of habitat has been lost - about eight times the size of the UK - and one of the biggest causes is food production.\n\"Today almost half of the world's habitable land is being used for agriculture. Across Southeast Asia vast palm oil plantations are replacing once pristine forests,\" Attenborough warns us in episode two, 'The New Wild'.\nThe destruction of the forests means there are dwindling food sources for local wildlife like pig-tailed macaques. But despite this, the episode brings us a remarkable story of their survival. A family of macaques are filmed entering palm oil plantations and capturing the rats that now live here.\n\"These pig-tailed macaques were predominantly vegetarian, and they are becoming carnivorous,\" the episode's producer Lydia Baines told BBC News.\n\"Animals are having to adapt in real time, essentially it is evolution in action. Darwin would be absolutely fascinated by this,\" she added.\nBut not all of the mammals are so successful. In one episode we learn that rising temperatures in the Arctic have led to the sea freezing later in the year, and without sea ice the polar bears and arctic foxes cannot hunt. For one fox the wait is too long and the crew speculate he has died from starvation - hunger drives the other foxes to feed on him.\nIn another devastating scene baby howler monkeys are left orphaned as their parents are electrocuted after mistaking electrical wires for tree branches.\nAs well as being heartbreaking, the filming of the animals did bring scientific breakthroughs.\nDr Christine Cooper, a senior lecturer in animal physiology at Curtin University, Perth worked with the BBC Natural History Unit to help track echidnas for episode five. Whilst fitting transmitters on the animals for the series they were heard making sounds to each other underground - a phenomenon only heard once before and not captured on tape.\nThe discovery led to a new scientific paper from Dr Cooper and her team. She says the research is vital if we want to protect animal species.\n\"So if we understand how animals work and how they meet all their requirements, then we have an idea of how they might respond to a changing world. Then we can also take steps to conserve species,\" she explained.\nThe series returns to some of the mammals filmed in the original series to see how human interventions are helping them to survive.\nThe blue whale was critically endangered until a whaling ban allowed their numbers to recover. 'Mammals' explores how they now face a new threat from shipping traffic, but wor",
    "A brown bear that injured five people during a rampage in a Slovak town has been shot dead, Environment Minister Tomas Taraba says.\nHowever, opposition politicians believe hunters may have shot a different bear and are calling for answers.\nVideo footage went viral when a brown bear bounded through the streets of Liptovsky Mikulas on 17 March.\nMr Taraba said it had been tracked down and killed after a 10-day hunt that used drone and biometric technology.\nIn a post on Facebook, the environment minister thanked all those who were involved in the operation.\nBut opposition politicians have called on Mr Taraba to clarify what happened and accuse the government of using the issue ahead of the presidential election on 6 April.\n\"I'm certain it's not the same bear. It's obvious,\" said Michal Wiezik, an environmental campaigner and MEP from opposition party Progressive Slovakia, who said shooting a bear that posed no threat amounted to a breach of Slovak and EU law.\nHe told the BBC that both the ministry and State Natural Protection Authority had said previously they were searching for a male bear weighing 80-100kg: \"But we now know what they killed was a female bear weighing 67.9kg and measuring 152cm - 30% smaller than the bear in Liptovsky Mikulas.\"\nA passer-by had found documents scattered by the roadside which had apparently been lost by members of the hunt team, he said.\nThe brown bear was captured on numerous photos and videos as it ran through the streets of the northern Slovak town earlier this month.\nOne video showed the bear swiping at a man on a pavement. Five people, including a 10-year-old girl, were injured, and two were taken to hospital with gashes and scratches.\nOne woman told a local paper she had been left traumatised by the attack.\nA state of alert with heightened police patrols had been declared in districts across the region last week as a preventative measure against similar attacks.\nSome members of Slovakia's populist nationalist government said the incident proved the need to loosen EU environmental protections on wildlife that prevent animals such as bears and wolves from being hunted.\n\"This is a case where a bear has brutally attacked people. One person almost lost an eye,\" Rudolf Huliak, an MP for the right-wing Slovak National Party - which is in charge of the environment ministry - told local media immediately after the incident.\nMr Huliak called for \"a firm solution to the excessive number of bears\".\nThe ministry plans - together with Romania - to appeal to EU colleagues to reclassify bears to allow selective culling.\nBetter environmental protection in Central and Eastern Europe since the fall of communism in 1989 has meant bears have returned to their natural habitats across the Carpathian mountain range, which stretches up from Romania through western Ukraine and on to Slovakia and Poland.\nResearchers, however, say there has been no explosion in Slovakia's estimated bear population, which they say remains stable at around 1,275.",
    "If you wanted to map the path to a healthy, functioning Palestinian government, you probably wouldn't start from here.\nThe last time Palestinians had the chance to vote for their national leaders was 18 years ago, and those elections sparked a civil war in Palestinian politics.\nThat isn't a metaphor: Hamas, which won the elections, and Fatah, the biggest political faction, were shooting each other in Gaza's streets.\nThe fighting ended with Hamas taking control of Gaza, and Fatah running the occupied West Bank through the Palestinian Authority (PA).\nIt was a political cold war that lasted for a generation. That is where this journey starts.\nThe 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and the war in Gaza, ripped that picture to shreds: Israel says it is intent on eliminating Hamas as a governing and military force in Gaza. International eyes have turned towards the PA as the vehicle that might - with enough reform - carry Palestinians into a new, united post-war era.\nThere are many challenges ahead.\nThe first is credibility. The Gaza war might have exploded Palestinian politics, but one of the few things it hasn't changed is disillusionment with the PA, the body that the US is banking on to take charge of Gaza.\nIt is widely seen as corrupt and inefficient, and - by some - as a security enforcer for the Israeli government in the West Bank.\nA poll this week by the respected Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah suggested that a majority of Palestinians think the PA should be dissolved. And satisfaction with its president in the West Bank, Mahmoud Abbas, was just 8%.\nMr Abbas has replaced his Prime Minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, in an effort to signal reform - or \"renewal\" as the American government has termed it. But it has not really moved the dial.\nThe new prime minister, an economist called Mohammad Mustafa, has been tasked with heading a technocratic interim government, and bringing together all the Palestinian political factions - including Hamas - to find some sort of consensus around a new unified vision for the future.\nAnd that is the second challenge: unity.\nSabri Saidam, a senior Fatah official, told me that the resignation of the government was designed to \"open up the floor\" to other factions - like Hamas - and give them \"the space to reconsider their political stance, and their obligations in the future - and also their role, given the changes that have happened since 7 October\".\n\"We have been talking to Hamas indirectly,\" he said. \"We have restated the importance of adhering to the [\u00e2\u0080\u00a6] two-state solution,\" referring to the idea that Israelis and Palestinians could live side-by-side in separate countries.\n\"And we have received positive signs.\"\nLast month, representatives from Fatah and Hamas sat down in Moscow with other Palestinian factions to discuss a way forward.\nIt was seen as a positive sign that Hamas backed a statement from that meeting, pledging support for the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), an umbrella group for Palestinian political movements that negotiated a previous peace deal with Israel.\nBut that feelgood moment in Moscow was quickly shattered when Hamas reacted furiously to the appointment of Mr Mustafa, accusing Mahmoud Abbas of acting unilaterally and taking \"empty steps\" without national consensus.\n\"Hamas did not react the way we had anticipated,\" said Sabri Saidam, although he believes it follows a familiar pattern of behaviour by the group.\n\"We hear some positive remarks [from Hamas], but then when it comes to practical engagement, there's always a setback,\" he told me.\n\"This time, things have to be different. We don't have the luxury of time to play with words without walking the talk.\"\nFatah hit back, accusing Hamas of triggering \"a catastrophe\" for the Palestinian people by attacking Israel on 7 October; a catastrophe that was worse, it said, than the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in 1948, when the Israeli state was created.\nSabri Saidam says the party is now waiting to see whether this incident marks the end of Hamas talking to the PLO, \"or is just a reflection of the chaos Hamas is in\".\nIt's early days, but so far the \"renewal\" of the PA hasn't yet delivered either unity with rival political factions, or credibility with the Palestinian people.\nElections - and a new leader - might help with both.\n\"It's so depressing to be 33-years-old - like I am now - and I haven't voted even once in my country,\" said Arab Barghouti, son of the jailed political leader Marwan Barghouti.\n\"People my age are ministers or parliament members in many other countries, but for us it's a dream to vote,\" he told me. \"We need that renewal in the whole system - and that can only happen with elections.\"\nArab's father Marwan - currently serving five life sentences for murder in an Israeli jail - is probably the most popular figure in Palestinian politics. His supporters call him the Palestinian Mandela.\nHe is one of few figures who could potentially ",

    "The bodies of two people have been recovered from a red pickup truck, which was under water where the Baltimore bridge collapsed.\nEight workers were on the bridge when it was struck by a ship, plunging them into the waters below.\nTwo were rescued on the day, but the search continues for the other four. All are presumed dead.\nSalvage crews are working to address hazardous materials and accident investigators are on the scene.\nFour of the six victims of the bridge collapse have been named so far.\nMaryland police said the bodies of Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, and Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, 26, were recovered from inside the truck. Mr Fuentes is originally from Mexico and Mr Cabrera is from Guatemala.\nDivers are no longer able to navigate the waters safely because of concrete and debris found in the river, police said.\nThey are now using sonar scans and believe that vehicles that may contain other bodies are \"encased in superstructure and concrete\" that came down from the bridge, an official said.\nTwo other missing men were named as Miguel Luna, originally from El Salvador, and Maynor Suazo Sandoval, a Honduran citizen.\nMexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier that two of its citizens were presumed dead - one of whom is now identified as Mr Fuentes - while another was rescued from the water.\nOne person who was in hospital after being pulled out of the water was released, officials said late Wednesday.\nFirst responders spent hours on Tuesday searching the waters of the Patapsco River for the six ,em, who were working on potholes on the bridge at about 01:30 (05:30 GMT) when it was hit by the ship. The US Coast Guard called off the search around sunset, saying cold water temperatures and hours gone by meant the workers were presumed dead.\nOfficials have pledged to find their bodies for their relatives.\n\"We've got to give these families closure,\" Wes Moore, governor of Maryland, told reporters on Wednesday, adding that air, land and water resources had been devoted to the search of the victims.\n\"My promise to them is this: I will devote every single resource to make sure that you receive closure,\" he said.\nBut the operation has been challenging, Coast Guard Vice-Adm Peter Gautier said on Wednesday, due to cold temperatures and debris in the water.\nThe cargo vessel itself is stable but has more than 1.5 million gallons of fuel oil and lubrication oil on board, Mr Gautier said.\nRoughly 4,700 cargo containers were also on board, including 56 that contained hazardous materials.\n\"The Coast Guard has moved aggressively to board the vessel and we have teams on board,\" Mr Gautier said.\nHe said there was \"no threat to the public from the hazardous materials on board\".\nJennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, said some containers with hazardous materials had been \"breached\".\nA total of 764 tonnes of mostly corrosive and flammable materials were identified, she said.\nThere was some sheen on the waterway around the collapse, Ms Homendy added.\nThe US Navy plans to use barges with heavy lift cranes - some can carry as much as 1,000 tonnes - to remove parts of the bridge that fell in the water.\nThe Dali was headed toward Sri Lanka when it lost power all of a sudden and issued a distress call before crashing into the Baltimore bridge.\nA data recorder recovered from the ship shows that power failed for just over a minute, but this was enough to make the collision unavoidable.\nIn an audio recording, the pilot can be heard giving steering commands and rudder orders as the ship approaches the bridge.\nOfficials say the bridge collapse at a key port could pose a risk to global supply chains and the US economy.\nMr Moore said that 8,000 jobs could be affected by the bridge collapse and called the incident a \"global crisis\".\n\"The national economy and global economy depends on the port,\" he said, noting that $80bn (\u00c2\u00a363.4bn) of cargo moved through there last year.\nPaul Wiedefeld, secretary of the Maryland Department of Transportation, stressed that replacing the bridge would not be a fast process, but he promised at Wednesday's news conference that officials were working to \"come up with a design for the replacement of that bridge as quickly as possible to get the port back up and the community back up and running\".\nExperts say Key Bridge's collapse could lead to losses of up to $15m (\u00c2\u00a311.8m) a day until the shipping lane is reopened.\nUS Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said he was confident \"thanks to the Biden administration\" that the state would get the necessary resources to recover and begin work on a replacement bridge.\n\"Our top priority is to get the shipping lane open because of the impact it has on our country and the global supply chain,\" he said.\nInvestigators are also hoping to determine whether dirty fuel played a role in the deadly crash. Maritime experts say contaminated fuel can cause a ship to black out as it creates problems with a vessel's main power generators.",
    "The rules for flying drones in the Channel Islands are to be reviewed due to an increase in their use.\nDirector of Civil Aviation John Nicholas said the drone code would \"very shortly\" be updated to reflect changing technology.\nMr Nicholas said new rules would \"improve clarity\" on how unmanned aircraft should be operated in local airspace.\nBut he insisted current guidance remained fit for purpose.\n'Cheaper and easier'\nMr Nicholas said that his team had seen an increase in the use of drones for activities including building surveys, film productions and light shows - such as at Jersey's Battle of Flowers.\n\"Drone technology in particular, more than many other areas, has advanced quite significantly over the last couple of years,\" he said.\n\"Part of the reason we are seeing more drones is because drones are becoming cheaper and easier to operate.\n\"We're just making sure we keep step with that improved technology to issue new guidance.\n\"We're very keen to encourage the use of drones or other aviation activities but we want to make sure that it is done safely and that we have sufficient oversight of that activity.\"\nCurrent rules for the Channel Islands stipulate that drones should not be flown higher than 400ft (122m) or within two nautical miles (3.2km) of Jersey, Guernsey or Alderney airports without permission from Air Traffic Control.\nDrones fitted with cameras must not be flown within 50m (164ft) of people, vehicles or structures, or over or within 150m (492ft) of congested areas or large outdoor gatherings.\nUK and European drone regulations do not apply in the islands.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook .

    "Dozens of people are still missing following the attack on the Crocus City Hall music venue in Moscow, raising fears that the death toll could rise higher than the current 143.\nSome relatives of the missing have been attempting to track down their loved ones in hospitals around the capital.\nThe fire which destroyed much of the venue is believed to have made many victims' remains unrecognisable.\n143 people are still missing, Russian investigators said on Wednesday.\n42-year-old Oleg Shikhovtsev from Lyubertsy, near Moscow, was at the concert by the band Picnic with his wife and 19-year-old daughter. The family was sitting towards the front of the venue when the attack began. Mr Shikhovtsev protected his wife, who was wounded in the back. His daughter was also injured.\nMr Shikhovtsev's wife was able to get her daughter out of the hall. On the street, they were picked up by strangers passing by Crocus by car and taken to the hospital.\nDoctors operated on his daughter, pulling a bullet out of her body. But since the attack, Oleg's relatives have not been able to reach him, they told the BBC. Calls to his phone have gone unanswered.\nIn the process of trying to find out what happened to Oleg, his relatives found a man who helped to carry the wounded out of the concert hall while it was on fire. He said that he also carried out a man who looked similar to Oleg.\nBut calls and visits to hospitals around Moscow have not been successful in locating him. Several people sent a graphic video published by the Islamic State group, the militant organisation which claimed responsibility for the attack, suggesting Oleg may be seen in it.\nBut his relatives told the BBC they don't believe he is.\nRussian officials have not contacted Oleg Shikhovtsev's relatives with information about his fate.\n\"There is still hope,\" a friend told the BBC. \"Maybe by some miracle they missed someone. Maybe they aren't telling us because he is in serious condition.\"\nThe Russian Investigative Committee said in a statement on Wednesday that genetic examinations were being carried out on remains found in the hall in order to identify victims of the attack.\nFour citizens of Tajikistan accused of being the gunmen who perpetrated the attack - named as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov - appeared in court on Sunday.

    "When Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 turned up to the Grammys in a cowboy hat, we should have known that something was afoot.\nA week later, she officially announced her country era - dropping two surprise singles in the middle of the Super Bowl.\nOne of them, the banjo-riffic Texas Hold 'Em, became the star's biggest hit in years. In the UK, it was number one for four weeks - her longest-ever spell at the top.\nNashville reacted with a shrug. Country radio only gave the song modest airplay, even as millions of streams propelled it to the top of Billboard's country chart.\nThis was pretty much what Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 expected.\nAs a Texan, country music is her birth right but, in an Instagram post last week , she wrote that her new album, Cowboy Carter, was \"born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed\".\nThis was likely a reference to her appearance at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where she performed her song Daddy Lessons with The Chicks (then known as the Dixie Chicks).\nBoth performers were deemed unwelcome - The Chicks had faced a backlash in the US after criticising former President George W Bush during the Iraq War; while Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9's vocal support of Black Lives Matter had upset many on the American right.\nTheir performance faced a barrage of criticism - and racism - online. Natalie Maines, lead singer of The Chicks, later told the New York Times that the way Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 was treated after the show was \"disgusting.\"\nIn her Instagram post, Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 said the experience prompted her to take \"a deeper dive into the history of country\".\nBut, she warned: \"This ain't a country album. This is a Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 album.\"\nToo right, it is.\nOver 27 interlocking songs and interludes, Cowboy Carter throws a lasso around country's sonic signifiers, and spins them into something unique: Appalachian fiddles are spliced with pop melodies, and lap steel guitars underscore rap verses with speaker-crushing sub bass.\nThat the genres overlap so seamlessly is evidence of Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9's technical mastery, but also of her central thesis: That Nashville's marginalisation of outsiders, and black women in particular, weakens the music in the long run.\nTo emphasise the point, Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 enlists a host of artists who've straddled the worlds of pop and country, including Dolly Parton, Willy Nelson, Miley Cyrus and Post Malone.\nAnd in one interlude, she juxtaposes the African-American spirituals that inspired country music (the pacifist anthem Down By The Riverside) with swing fiddle tunes that inspired black pioneers of rock and roll (Chuck Berry's Maybellene, based on the traditional American song Ida Red).\n\" Genres are a funny little concept, aren't they? \" asks Linda Martell, the first black woman to perform at the Grand Ole Opry, on a track called Spaghetti.\n\" In theory, they have a simple definition that's easy to understand. But in practice, well, some may feel confined .\"\n'Hussy with the good hair'\nIf this all sounds dry and academic, don't be put off. Cowboy Carter is a blast, with hooky, memorable songs that are theatrical, mournful, playful, lovestruck, whimsical and carnal - often at the same time.\nIt opens with an acknowledgement that Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9's recent albums have become socio-political talking points, while asking fans to drown out the chatter.\n\" There's a lot of talking going on, while I sing my song ,\" she sings over a psychedelic wash of sitar. \" Can you hear me? Do you hear me .\"\nThe dramatic opener segues into a faithful cover of The Beatles' Blackbird - chosen not just for its timeless melody, but for its inspiration: A group of nine black students, known as the Little Rock Nine , who faced discrimination after enrolling in an all-white high school in Arkansas, 1957.\nIt's never stated explicitly, but the parallels between their struggle and the segregation of country music are duly noted.\nElsewhere, Protector is a gentle, touching ode to motherhood, introduced by a voice note of Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9's daughter Rumi pleading, \"Mum can I hear the lullaby please?\"\nDaughter is much darker - a visceral account of a bathroom stall fight, where Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 leaves another woman \"black and blue\" on the \"filthy floors\".\n\" If you cross me, I'm just like my father / I am colder than Titanic water, \" she warns, before the song cedes way to the 18th Century aria, Caro Mio Ben.\nIntriguingly, this song follows a cover of Dolly Parton's Jolene - a country blockbuster inspired by a real-life brush with infidelity.\nParton herself introduces the track, noting the parallels between her lyrics and \"that hussy with the good hair\" - a reference to Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9's 2016 song Sorry, in which she called out \"Becky with the good hair\" as the (alleged) mistress of her husband, Jay-Z.\n\"No matter the genre, heartache hits the same,\" Parton observes.\nOther highlights include the luscious, understated spiritual Just For Fun; and YaYa, a goodtime hoedown that somehow interpolates both the Beach Boys' Good Vibrations and Nancy Sinatra's These Boots Are Made For Walkin'.\nThe use of acoustic in",

    "Shamima Begum has lost an initial bid to challenge the removal of her British citizenship at the Supreme Court.\nThe 24-year-old had requested permission from the Court of Appeal to take her case to the UK's highest court.\nThe government stripped her citizenship on national security grounds in 2019, leaving her stateless.\nMs Begum left London nine years ago aged 15 to travel to Syria and join the Islamic State group, or IS.\nEarlier this year, three judges at the Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed her bid to regain her citizenship.\nShe now has the option to ask the Supreme Court directly for permission to have her case heard.\nDelivering the Court of Appeal's rejection in February, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr said: \"It could be argued the decision in Ms Begum's case was harsh. It could also be argued that Ms Begum is the author of her own misfortune.\n\"But it is not for this court to agree or disagree with either point of view. Our only task is to assess whether the deprivation decision was unlawful. We have concluded it was not, and the appeal is dismissed.\"\nHer lawyers have argued that the Home Office's decision to remove her citizenship was unlawful, in part because British officials failed to properly consider whether she was a potential victim of trafficking.\nMs Begum, born in the UK to parents of Bangladeshi heritage, was one of three east London girls who travelled to Syria in 2015 to support the IS group. She left with her friends Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase.\nMs Sultana is thought to have died when a house was blown up. The fate of Ms Abase is unknown.\nMs Begum lived under IS rule for more than three years. She married a Dutch member of IS, who is currently held in a Kurdish detention centre, and lived in Raqqa, once a stronghold of the group. She had three children, all of whom have died.\nShe was found in al-Roj camp in northern Syria in 2019 following the defeat of IS, and remains there to this day.\nHer lawyers say conditions in the camp have reached a \"critical point\", with \"near starvation\" and disease now seen daily.\n\"The fact of the matter is this - that Shamima, as with other British women and children, is arbitrarily detained in a prison camp in north east Syria,\" her lawyers said in a written statement on her behalf.\n\"It is not a refugee camp - those detained are unable to leave and the conditions have, with ever greater urgency, been categorised by every international body as well as by the UK courts in Shamima's case itself, as constituting torture and inhuman treatment.\"\nMs Begum has admitted knowingly joining a proscribed organisation. She said that she was \"ashamed\" to have done so and regretted it.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Our priority remains maintaining the safety and security of the UK and we will robustly defend any decision made in doing so.\"",
    "An Australian man has been freed after spending more than 30 hours in an underground drain network.\nThe 38-year-old originally told authorities he had entered the drain in Brisbane to \"retrieve his phone\".\nBut Queensland police said he had \"fled\" there, after his car crashed into one of their vehicles on Sunday.\nThe man was rescued after a passerby phoned authorities to report that someone was \"stuck\" underground. He was treated for abrasions and hypothermia.\nLocal media reported the man had been in knee-deep water before firefighters lifted a drain lid, allowing him to climb out.\nThe rescue effort took about five minutes, a Queensland Fire and Emergency Services spokesperson told the BBC.\nLocal resident James Lingwood - who made the call to authorities - told the Courier Mail newspaper that he first encountered the man on Sunday after hearing a voice \"sort of yelling\".\n\"He seemed to be okay, and he said he could get out where he got in so I just left him alone,\" he told the newspaper .\nBy Monday though, when he returned to the same spot, he decided to act after hearing \"heavy breathing\" indicating \"someone was in distress\".\nOn Tuesday, police said the man had been driving in a \"suspicious\" car that reversed and struck a police vehicle around 4:20 (18:20 GMT) on Sunday, causing damage to both cars. No police officers were injured.\nHis car then sped off before being involved in a second crash, which caused \"minor injuries\" to the other driver, they said.\nMoments later, the suspect allegedly abruptly exited the car and ran from the scene on foot.\n\"It's amazing what people will do sometimes and what happens, so yes, there's always surprises,\" acting police commissioner Steve Gollschewski told media on Tuesday, when asked about the case.\nPolice say the man - who is in a stable condition - is now assisting them with their enquiries.",
    "It's a year since an apparently \"rusty\" bridge was erected across the busy M8 motorway in Glasgow.\nDecades after the road divided the city, the eye-catching structure finally reconnects communities in the north with the centre.\nLocal pedestrians and cyclists no longer face lengthy commutes and say Sighthill Bridge has \"transformed\" their journeys to work and college.\nThey told BBC Scotland News they feel safer and have more pride in the area.\nLocal man Ramsay Sartawi, 35, said the bridge had already become a city landmark.\n\"Everyone knows where the rusty bridge is,\" he said. \"I can't remember what the actual official name is, but the Rusty Bridge is its name.\"\nIt has made life a lot easier for locals, Mr Sartawi said.\n\"When this wasn't here, you had to walk almost all the way to the west end and then back in or else down towards the Royal [Infirmary] - a good mile in the other direction,\" he added.\n\"So it's a lot more convenient if you're living in Springburn or Sighthill.\"\nUnlike the other concrete bridges over the motorway, Sighthill Bridge is made of Cor-Ten steel, a long-lasting material which requires little maintenance.\nWeighing about 1,000 tonnes and spanning 74m (80yds), the bridge features seating areas and landscaping, including thousands of new plants.\nWith a long southern approach ramp for wheelers, it was designed to encourage more active travel in the area.\nMr Sartawi said: \"There was a little bridge here before but it was very old and not well lit with a dodgy entrance - you wouldn't really use it at night.\"\n\"Before it was just grass and mud around here, but now you see people here all the time just sitting or reading or hanging out, just because it's a nice place to be when the weather's good,\" he added.\nThe bridge is part of a \u00c2\u00a3250m regeneration of Sighthill - the biggest UK project of its kind outside London, according to Glasgow City Council.\nPlans for the area also include almost 1,000 new homes and landscaping.\nSimon Taylor, who lives in nearby Speirs Wharf, said it had transformed his commute next to the motorway into a \"country walk\".\n\"Before it was a small bridge and it wasn't as nice, all of the landscaping has been restored so it's a much nicer walk into town,\" he said. \"It's connected everything up and it looks better.\n\"There used to be tower blocks as well and this must be better than the high rises.\n\"There's stuff going on all down the canal corridor.\"\nSighthill was once home to 10 tower blocks which housed thousands of residents.\nBuilt in the 1960s, the council began demolishing the high rises as part of the regeneration project over the past two decades.\nLauren Guthrie, who lives in Sighthill, said the bridge made her feel much safer when walking home from lectures.\nThe 21-year-old student said: \"I lived locally before moving into the new housing and it's changed the area a lot. It feels much safer.\n\"If I'm coming home from the town, it's all well lit and I can just go over the bridge whereas before you're talking about a big detour when it's quite dark and there's not many people about.\n\"I don't feel unsafe walking home and there's always people around.\"\nShe added: \"It has helped a lot - especially before it was an area that was deprived but I can see the difference.\n\"Hopefully they do continue to make investments as I'd like to see it go a bit further.\"\nEmily Dibble, a 20-year-old student at Glasgow Caledonian University, said she usually parked her car in Sighthill to get to her lectures.\n\"I park here for free and I just commute to university,\" she said. \"It's so much easier and better than paying for parking in the centre.\n\"I live about 15 minutes away and only recently saw it advertised when it was done up. It's made things much easier.\"\nIn December 2022, the \u00c2\u00a322m Sighthill Community Campus officially opened to combine two local primary schools and open a new nursery for the area.\nA new playpark followed, as well as new housing next to the bridge in Sighthill Circus.\nResidents started moving into the new homes in October 2023.\nMore \"mixed-tenure\" housing is planned for 2024, as well as the opening of allotment spaces for locals.\nA Glasgow City Council spokesman said: \"The Sighthill Bridge has been a great addition to not only the ongoing regeneration of Sighthill, but as an example of how an infrastructure project can deliver benefits to people's lives.\n\"The striking bridge reconnected Sighthill to the nearby city centre, providing a new active travel route to north Glasgow, and is a symbol of the transformation of this area.\"",

    "The UN Security Council has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, after the US did not veto the measure in a shift from its previous position.\nIt also demanded the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.\nIt is the first time the council has called for a ceasefire since the war began in October after several failed attempts.\nThe move by the US signals growing divergence between it and its ally Israel over Israel's offensive in Gaza.\nIn an unusually strong rebuke, a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the US had \"abandoned\" its previous position which had directly linked a ceasefire to a hostage release.\n\"Regrettably, the United States did not veto the new resolution,\" it said.\nThe statement said this harmed efforts to release hostages by giving Hamas hope it could use international pressure on Israel to achieve a ceasefire without freeing the captives.\nIt also said Mr Netanyahu had decided to cancel meetings between an Israeli delegation and US officials in Washington that were scheduled for this week.\nIsrael's defence minister said Israel would not stop the war in Gaza while hostages were still being held there.\nThe Palestinian representative to the UN, Riyad Mansour, welcomed the resolution but said it was overdue.\n\"It has taken six months, over 100,000 Palestinians killed and maimed, two million displaced, and famine, for this council to finally demand an immediate ceasefire,\" Mr Mansour said.\nHamas, the Palestinian Islamist group which governs Gaza and which triggered the war with an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, also welcomed the resolution. It said it was ready \"to engage in an immediate prisoner exchange process that leads to the release of prisoners on both sides\".\nThe group has made any hostage release conditional on the release by Israel of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.\nIn the Security Council vote on Monday, the US abstained, while the remaining 14 members voted in favour.\nThe US had previously blocked resolutions calling for a ceasefire, saying such a move would be wrong while delicate negotiations for a truce and hostage releases were continuing between Israel and Hamas.\nBut on Thursday it tabled its own draft, which for the first time called for a ceasefire, marking a hardening of its stance towards Israel.\nUS National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US' decision to let the resolution pass did not mean a \"shift in our policy\". He said the US backed a ceasefire but did not vote in favour of the resolution because the text did not condemn Hamas.\nSpeaking at a press briefing after the resolution was passed, Mr Kirby said: \"We have been very clear, we have been very consistent in our support for a ceasefire as part of a hostage deal. That's how the hostage deal is structured, and the resolution acknowledges the ongoing talks.\"\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the resolution \"must be implemented\" to secure a ceasefire and the \"immediate and unconditional release of all hostages\".\nMark Lyall-Grant, who was the UK ambassador to the UN from 2009 to 2015, told BBC Radio's 4 PM programme that the resolution meant Israel was now \"under an obligation, essentially, to stop its military campaign for the next 15 days\" - the duration of the remainder of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which the text stipulated for the ceasefire.\nHe added that the text was legally binding on Israel but not on Hamas, as the Palestinian group is not a state.\nThe US had previously been accused of using its power of veto to shield Israel at the UN.\nHowever, it has become increasingly critical of Israel over the escalating death toll in Gaza, where more than 32,000 people - mainly women and children - have been killed by Israel's bombardment, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe US has also pressed Israel to do more to get aid delivered to Gaza, where it says the entire population is suffering severe levels of acute food insecurity.\nThe UN has accused Israel of obstructing aid; Israel has blamed the UN, accusing it of failing to carry out distributions.\nThe current war broke out after Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and taking 253 into Gaza as hostages.\nOf those taken, 130 remain unaccounted for following a series of releases, rescues and the recovery of bodies.\nDespite Israel's decision to cancel a planned visit by its delegation to Washington later this week in the wake of the Security Council resolution, Mr Kirby has said that scheduled meetings between Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan will continue as planned.\n\"We look forward to making it clear to the defence minister that the United States continues to stand with Israel as they fight Hamas,\" he said at the press briefing on Monday.",

Many visitors come from Taiwan, with which Palau has diplomatic ties. Taiwanese aid boosts the economy. The government is Palau's largest employer.\nMonoliths and other relics are reminders of an ancient culture that thrived on the islands, and despite Western trappings many Palauans identify strongly with their traditions and rites.\nPalau's recent history has been dominated by outside influences from Spain, Britain, Germany, Japan and the US. Palau saw some of the region's fiercest fighting in World War Two.\nIn 2006, a new Congress building was opened at Ngerulmud, which replaced the republic's largest settlement, Koror City, as the country's capital.\nThere is concern that the low-lying islands could be badly affected by rising sea levels possibly due to climate change.\nREPUBLIC OF PALAU: FACTS\nLEADERS\nPresident: Surangel Whipps Jr\nSurangel Whipps Jr won the 2020 election, beating outgoing Vice-President Raynold Oilouch.

However, news outlets often struggle financially.\nRegional and international news services are also available.\nTIMELINE\nSome key events in Palau's history:\nc. 2500BC - Palau's first inhabitants - thought to have come from present-day eastern Indonesia - settle in the islands. The early Palauans develop complex social systems, practice fishing and farming.\n1783 - English captain Henry Wilson is shipwrecked on a reef and becomes the first Westerner to visit.\n1885 - Spain asserts its claim to the islands, which it administers as part of the Philippines.\n1899 - Spain sells Palau to Germany as part of German New Guinea in the German-Spanish Treaty. Germany begins to exploit the islands' resources using native labour. Phosphate is mined and coconut plantations are developed.\n1914 - Shortly after the outbreak of World War One, Japan seizes the islands from Germany and annexes them.\n1919 - Following World War One, the League of Nations formally places the islands under Japanese administration as part of its South Seas Mandate.\n1939-45 - World War Two\n1941-42 - Japan uses Palau as a base to support its invasion and conquest of the Philippines.\n1944 - US forces retake the islands in a bitter campaign amid controversy over the island's negligible wartime strategic value and the high casualty rate, which exceeded that of all other amphibious operations during the Pacific fighting.\n1947 - Palau becomes a United Nations Trust Territory under US administration.\n1979 - While four UN Trust Territories join to form the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands vote against the proposed constitution.\n1981 - Republic of Palau comes into being, following the territory's adoption of a constitution.\n1982 - Palau signs a Compact of Free Association with the US, gaining access to US aid in return for US military rights.\n1994 - Palau becomes independent under the Compact of Free Association with the US. Palau receives financial and other aid from Washington, and the US retains responsibility for defence and the right to operate military bases. Palau joins the UN.\n2022 - Palau agrees to host a sophisticated $100m US air force over-the-horizon radar station, which is due to be operational by 2026.",
    "Six people are missing and presumed dead after a container ship hit the landmark Francis Scott Key Bridge in the US city of Baltimore, causing it to collapse.\nThe Coast Guard said it had suspended its search and begun a recovery effort.\nThe bridge, which is more than 2.6km (1.6 miles) long, was destroyed after the vessel hit a support.\nOfficials say the ship suffered a \"power issue\" and sent out a distress call moments before the crash.\nBoats and helicopters were part of a huge search and rescue effort looking for the six missing people. Two others were pulled from the water, with one in a serious condition.\nRear Admiral Shannon Gilreath of the US Coast Guard said in the evening that the remaining missing men were presumed dead based on the temperature of the waters they had fallen into, and the length of time they have been gone.\nAuthorities said the men were part of a construction crew repairing potholes at the time the bridge snapped.\nThe focus is now turning to the investigation into what went wrong, with a team of transportation safety experts hoping to board the stricken ship and recover its data recorder.\nThe Singapore-flagged container ship, Dali, struck a support column on the 47-year-old bridge at 01:30 (05:30 GMT) on Monday, causing it to collapse.\nIt had departed from the terminal at Port Breeze at around 00:45 bound for the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo.\nA US federal government agency said the vessel \"lost propulsion\" as it was leaving the port.\nThe crew then warned Maryland transport officials of a possible collision, according to an unclassified Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency report on the incident.\nMaryland state governor Wes Moore said he could confirm that \"the crew notified authorities of a power issue\", adding that the ship had lost power before smashing into one of the columns supporting the bridge.\nA number of vehicles, including \"one the size of a tractor-trailer\", plunged into the water below, officials said.\nBaltimore fire department, the US Coastguard and other agencies from the state of Maryland have been involved in the rescue operation.\nBaltimore Fire Chief James Wallace confirmed that two people had been rescued and one of them had been \"transported to a local trauma centre... in a very serious condition\".\nMr Wallace said the tide was posing a challenge to rescue efforts. Local officials said another huge concern for rescue teams was the freezing conditions, with air temperatures of about 3C (37.4F) near the bridge.\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott described the incident as an \"unthinkable tragedy\", adding that the focus right now should be on \"the people, the lives, the souls\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there are people in the water that we have to get out and that's the only thing we should be talking about.\"\nMaryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld said engineers were at the site determining the structural impact of the collapse.\nOfficials said that there were 23 people on the ship, including an all-Indian crew and two Baltimore locals serving as port pilots, and that there were no reports of any injuries.\nPilots are people with local knowledge who board ships and help manoeuvre them into and out of a port.\nThe company said in a statement that the exact cause of the incident had yet to be determined and that it was \"fully co-operating\" with federal agencies.\nShipping giant Maersk said it had chartered the vessel and it was carrying its customers' cargo.\n\"We are horrified by what has happened in Baltimore, and our thoughts are with all of those affected,\" it said in a statement. No Maersk crew and personnel were onboard the vessel.\nUS President Joe Biden said he would travel to Baltimore as soon as possible, and that search and rescue efforts should be prioritised.\n\"I've directed my team to move heaven and earth to reopen the port and rebuild the bridge as soon as humanly possible,\" he said.\nHe said the collapse had been an accident and that federal government would \"pay for the entire cost of that bridge\" - the spending, he added, would need to be approved by members of congress.",
    "A winding up petition has been issued against a funeral company at the centre of a police inquiry over a claim of \"significant\" unpaid council debt.\nHull City Council said its petition against Legacy Independent Funeral Directors would be \"considered\" at a court hearing on 9 April 2024.\nThe firm owed the authority \u00c2\u00a351,508.46 for unpaid charges including cremation fees, which \"became apparent\" in February 2023, the council said.\nLegacy has been contacted for comment.\nTwo people are on bail after a police investigation into the company began on 6 March following a report of \"concern for care of the deceased\".\nFew details about the police investigation have been revealed but 35 bodies were removed from the firm's Hessle Road premises and taken to another mortuary. Their families have been contacted, Humberside Police had said.\nThe force said a specialist team of officers was also examining a quantity of ashes recovered from this site.\nMP for Hull West and Hessle Emma Hardy said affected families would not have to pay for another funeral, with the costs being picked up by the local authority using funds given by the government.\nSpecific matters such as payments for wakes, flowers, or if there will be a \"large civic funeral\" or individual funerals for the deceased are yet to be decided.\n\"Those questions need to be thought through with the families directly involved and with the council\", Ms Hardy added.\nIn total, Legacy allegedly racked up nearly \u00c2\u00a355,000 in debt, of which \u00c2\u00a32,000 is said to be owed to East Riding of Yorkshire Council for unpaid burial fees, the BBC understands.\nHull City Council said it had obtained a County Court Judgement last year for the unpaid \u00c2\u00a351,508.46 debt and arrangements had since been made for the money to be repaid, with the most recent payment being made by the firm to the authority on 29 February - about a week before police started its investigation.\nIn a statement, the council said: \"Due to the nature of the industry, it is not unusual for funeral directors to have money owing, as they await payments from families who have lost loved ones.\n\"But it became apparent in February of last year that the debt owing to the council by Legacy Independent Funeral Directors Ltd was becoming significant, so the council obtained a County Court Judgement of \u00c2\u00a351,508.46, in relation to unpaid fees and charges, including cremation fees.\nIt is unclear how long the debt has been accumulating but the authority said it was trying to recover the remaining \u00c2\u00a340,938.08 debt.\n\"We are exploring options to recoup that sum, and have issued a petition to wind up the company, which will be considered at court on Tuesday 9th April 2024.\"\nLegacy, which was established in 2010, was given formal notice on a number of occasions between 4 January 2022 and 12 March 2024 that it would be struck off, according to Companies House records.\nIt was issued five First Gazette notices, meaning the company was in the process of being removed from the register and would no longer legally exist.\nBut on four occasions Legacy was given a reprieve to have the \"compulsory strike-off action\" discontinued and a fifth warning was \"temporarily suspended\" on 19 March because the registrar received an \"objection\".\nMs Hardy said the potential for regulating the funeral industry was discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday and there would be a \"call for evidence\" in two months' time to begin the process.\nHumberside Police said it had received more than 1,500 calls from people who had used Legacy and were concerned about their loved ones' remains.\nOfficers cordoned off three sites after the force received a report on 6 March of concerns \"in relation to the storage and management and processes of the deceased people within those premises\".\nCordons were subsequently lifted at Legacy's premises in Hessle Road and Anlaby Road in Hull, and Beckside in Beverley.\nA 46-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of prevention of a lawful and decent burial, fraud by false representation and fraud by abuse of position. They have since been released on bail while police inquiries continue .\nThe force said its dedicated helpline numbers remain open.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) , and Instagram .

    "The story of a town lost to the sea more than 650 years ago will be told at an exhibition in Hull.\nRavenser Odd, near Spurn Point, was granted its charter, along with Hull, by King Edward I on 1 April 1299.\nThose original charters, on loan from the National Archives, will be on display for the first time outside of London.\nArchivist Martin Taylor says it is a \"real coup\" for Hull.\nCalled Hull/Ravenser Odd: Twin Cities, Sunken Pasts, the exhibition will display the documents along with items from the collection at Hull History Centre.\nRavenser became a thriving Humber port in medieval times. According to author Phil Mathison, it had two MPs, warehouses, a large fishing fleet and \"its power rivalled at least Grimsby and Hull\".\nOver the course of about 100 years, some of the town's buildings were lost to erosion before it disappeared in the 1360s.\nIn 2022, an underwater sonar search by the University of Hull uncovered sand dunes on the seabed, which suggested stone structures underneath.\nExperts said the sonar findings were similar to other sites around the world where ancient buildings have been uncovered.\nThe exhibition opens on Tuesday 26 March and runs until 30 May 2024.\nDr Kathryn Maude, from the National Archives, and Dr Emily Robinson, from the University of Sussex, will give a talk about the history and folklore of Ravenser Odd on 9 April.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "The impact on people who lost their savings in the Norton Motorcycles pension scheme collapse has been devastating, a regulator said.\nTony Raymond, general counsel at The Pensions Regulator, apologised to victims of the scheme run by Stuart Garner.\nGarner breached pensions regulations by investing more of people's money in his business than was allowed.\nThe Pension Protection Fund said those who lost money would be paid back.\nGarner ran the motorcycle firm from 2008 until it went bust in January 2020.\nHis business was given millions of pounds by the government and was endorsed by MPs, but 227 members lost money after investing in three pension schemes, of which Garner was trustee.\nNorton Motorcycles was bought out of administration in April 2020 and is now a separate business under new ownership.\n'Uncomfortable' situation\nSpeaking to the work and pensions committee in Westminster on Wednesday, Mr Raymond apologised to those who lost money.\nThe body - which is in place to make sure that workplace pension schemes are run properly - approved the scheme, despite it being linked to a company it had previously suspended for its involvement in another scheme.\n\"It's fair to say that the impact that this case has had on the individuals of this scheme has been utterly devastating,\" Mr Raymond said.\n\"If we could turn the clock back and do it differently, yes we would, is the simple answer. To that extent, I obviously apologise.\n\"Looking at the situation now, it obviously feels uncomfortable.\n\"I can't get around that. But, I can recall at the time we had a very high volume of cases that were even more egregious.\"\nMr Raymond said that, at the time of the scheme's registration, it was not practice for the body to run checks to ensure pension providers were legitimate.\nThe committee heard the regulator was sent a whistleblowing report in 2013, which it passed on to Action Fraud - the national fraud reporting service - but did not investigate the pension scheme itself.\nThe regulator said the issue \"was not prioritised\" due to the large number of cases it was dealing with.\nA formal investigation was launched in 2017 when a second report was sent by a whistleblower.\nGarner was later found to have \"acted dishonestly and in breach of his duty\" following an investigation by The Pensions Ombudsman.\nHe was given a suspended sentence over the missing pensions cash in 2022.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "Louise Bruder never forgets a face. Which is not only a handy skill at parties, but it has helped her carve out a career.\nShe has the fabulous job title of super-recogniser, and her work at UK digital ID firm Yoti involves comparing the photos on an identity document with an uploaded selfie, to determine if it is the same person.\nBut Yoti, in common with other ID firms, faces a new threat - spotting so-called deepfakes. These are fake images created using AI-powered software.\nLouise tells me that she hasn't yet been asked to assess deepfakes as part of her day job, but the firm is well aware of the threat. And so, it is actively working on technology that will help spot them.\nPutting her skills to the test with the BBC's own Deepfake Quiz, she scored seven out of eight. \"There's a deadness in people's eyes that really means they don't look real,\" says Louise.\nBen Colman is the boss of Reality Defender, a US firm that aims to provide technology to spot deepfakes, and he thinks Louise may struggle soon to tell real from fake.\n\"I'd say that in the last nine months it's become next to impossible for even the best experts to tell real versus AI generated. We need a software solution to do this,\" he says.\nMr Colman differentiates between really sophisticated deepfakes, which may be deployed by a nation state to create disinformation, and what he calls \"cheapfakes\", whereby criminals use off-the-shelf AI software.\nWorryingly, even the cheap fakes \"are still good enough to fool people, particularly within images and audio,\" he says. Video, though \"is still a little more challenging, and requires a lot more computation\".\nThe solution his firm offers can scan and flag AI representation in an image, video or audio. Clients include the Taiwanese government, Nato, media organisations and large banks.\nWhile it is video or image deepfakes that more often get the headlines, audio-only scams are also growing. For example criminals sending voice recordings using a person's voice to say things like \"Mum, I've lost my phone, please pay money to this account now\".\nCollecting voice clips from someone's account social media or YouTube is an easy job, and just a few seconds of audio is enough to clone the voice and use it to create sentences the person never said.\nSome off the shelf software even allows users to \"dial up\" stress levels in a voice, a technique that has been used to fool parents in real cases where parents believed their child had been kidnapped.\nSiwei Lyu is a professor at the University of Buffalo in the US who has studied deepfakes for many years, with the ultimate goal of developing algorithms to help automatically identify and expose them.\nThe algorithms are trained to spot tiny differences - eyes that might not be quite looking in the right direction or, in the case of an artificially created voice, a lack of evidence of breath.\nRead more stories on artificial intelligence\nProf Lyu thinks there needs to be a degree of urgency to solving the problem, warning that video conferencing may be the next target for criminals.\n\"Not far in the future you could be plugged into a Zoom call, and you think you are talking to me, but it might be a virtual version of me. Somebody might use my image and create that as a deepfake presence in the zoom call.\"\nDeepfakes also have the potential to cause widespread societal disruption. Last year, a fake image of an explosion near the Pentagon went viral on social media, as did fake pictures of Donald Trump in handcuffs.\nAnd in January, the New Hampshire Department of Justice was forced to release a statement saying that a recorded audio of Joe Biden telling residents not to vote in the state primary election was a deepfake.\nSigurdur Arnason runs a music creation platform in Iceland. Before Christmas he was asked by the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service to create a video music skit using a deepfake of a beloved dead Icelandic comedian called Hemmi Gunn for a show that aired on New Year's Eve.\n\"We thought it would be a fun project,\" he says. \"We asked permission from the comedian's family and we created our own in-house AI models.\"\nThe skit did more than amuse, though.\n\"It sent shockwaves through the whole country,\" says Mr Arnason. \"All of the radio, online news publications and TV were all talking about it. Some family members were not happy because it was so real. Politicians started talking about AI regulation.\"\nIt is important that politicians and the general public have such conversations and debates, thinks Christopher Doss, a researcher at think tank Rand Corporation.\nHe recently conducted a study into deepfakes which revealed that the more humans are exposed to deepfakes, the less likely they are to correctly identify them.\nAnd he worries that using AI tools to fight the threat of AI creations could be a flawed approach.\n\"It's just going to set up a kind of arms race between those who are trying to detect it, and those who are trying to evade detection,\" he says. \"The a",

Mr Liberati explained that he has a friend in his 70s who swims six or seven times a week.\nThe DBWS distinction would place a legal duty on the Environment Agency to monitor the river quality in this area and publish information to the public about how safe it is for wild swimming.\nThere are currently only three rivers in England that have been granted the status.\nDuring heavy rainfall, the local mostly Victorian sewage system managed by Wessex Water can overflow which causes raw sewage to be discharged into the river.\nThe Conham Bathing group have taken it upon themselves to test the River Avon for bacteria such as E. coli, and the samples are sent to Wessex Water's laboratory for testing.\nConham Bathing campaign also has an online database that tracks sewage overspill statistics into the Avon.\nIn February 2024, the group says raw sewage flowed into the river for a combined total of 8,164 minutes - more than five and a half days.\nIt also claims that in 2023, sewage was discharged into the river for 26,757 minutes, meaning that the month of February 2024 alone has accumulated over 30% of the total sewage discharge time from the previous year.\nDr Eva Perrin and Emma Nicol are founding members of the Conham Bathing group.\nDr Perrin, an expert in freshwater ecology, said that DBWS would be \"a mechanism for wider change\".\n\"We just don't have enough data to understand the impact of sewage on the ecosystem,\" she said.\n\"Rivers are such dynamic systems, with so many inputs throughout the whole catchment basin that can affect any given bathing site.\"\nIn areas that are granted DBWS, the Environment Agency tests the water once a week during peak swimming season - May to September.\nDr Perrin said: \"So, that's a maximum of 20 samples a year taken at one point in time, in one location.\"\nIn 2022, a petition organised by Conham Bathing gathered over 5,000 signatures, and Bristol City Council unanimously voted to amend the bylaw that prohibits swimming between the Floating Harbour and Hanham Lock which would then allow a DBWS application.\nThis decision was overruled by mayor for Bristol Marvin Rees.\nA spokesperson for the council said: \"Without professional safety supervision and direction there remain a number of significant risks associated with entering Bristol's waterways, including at Conham.\"\nThe council cited the risk of cold-water shock, waterways traffic and the risk of illness and infection as why many open water areas in Bristol have bylaws which prohibit swimming.\nBut as the council's pilot swimming scheme at Baltic Wharf in the Floating Harbour enters its second season, the Conham Bathing campaigners are hopeful that swimming will soon be allowed in other areas of the city.\nMs Nicol said: \"There's already so many barriers to accessing nature anyway. It can't always just be for the people in the city centre who can afford to pay for it.\n\"It's about enabling people to access nature, and of course the environment more broadly, because if the environment's healthy, then it benefits us in so many ways. \"\nDuring eDNA sampling in 2022, Bristol City Council found that the Avon was home to the critically-endangered European eel, as well as Atlantic salmon and brown trout.\nMs Nicol said: \"Commercially important species like salmon are using the river. They just shouldn't have to suffocate in our excrement.\"\nA new documentary film 'Rave On for the Avon' by Charlotte Sawyer has followed the Conham Bathing campaign. The film will screen in Brislington on Saturday, 23 March.\nMs Sawyer said: \"The hope is to change the minds of the powers that be that are stopping this from being a designated bathing spot by showing them how much people love the river, how many people rely on it for mental health and wellbeing.\n\"In this film there were ups and downs, but it is about love and it is about positivity, because otherwise with campaigning you just just get burnt out and you get so frustrated.\"\nMs Sawyer hopes the film will encourage a national discussion of the cleanliness of our rivers and inspire other wild swimmers to campaign for DBWS.\nLocal MP for Bristol East Kerry McCarthy told the BBC: \"I love wild swimming, but then I don't get to do it very much.

    "The attack on a Moscow concert hall on Friday was the worst in Russia for years. More than 130 people were killed as gunmen stormed the complex, days after President Vladimir Putin began his fifth term of office. The Islamic State group (IS) has said four of its members carried out the attack.\nThis is what is known so far.\nHow did the attack unfold?\nCrocus City Hall, on the outskirts of Moscow - 20km (12 miles) from the Kremlin - was about to host a concert by the rock group Picnic when gunmen burst into the foyer just after 20:00 (17:00 GMT) on Friday evening.\nVideo showed at least four people shooting randomly before proceeding into the concert hall itself and opening fire there.\nInside the auditorium, a woman said she and other visitors rushed towards the stage as soon as they realised shots were being fired.\n\"I saw a person in the stalls with a sidearm and there were cracks [of gunfire] going off, I was trying to crawl behind a loudspeaker,\" she told Russian TV.\nAt some point, fire can be seen inside the hall. Flames later engulfed the facade, while glass on the top two floors of the seven-storey building blew out.\n\"The terrorists used a flammable liquid to set fire to the concert hall's premises, where spectators were located, including wounded,\" Russia's Investigative Committee said.\nHelicopters were brought in to drop about 160 tonnes of water, but it took some 10 hours for the fire to be contained.\nBy the time the suspects escaped - according to some accounts, the attack lasted about 20 minutes - hundreds had been killed and injured.\nMany died from bullet wounds, some as a result of smoke inhalation.\nPicnic's band members themselves were unharmed.\nWho are the Crocus City Hall victims?\nMore than 6,000 Russians had flocked to the retail and concert complex for the event.\nThe number of those who were killed has been rising steadily.\nBy Sunday afternoon, at least 137 had been confirmed dead. The first official list of casualties suggested the oldest victim was in her 70s, with three children among the dead.\nIn addition to those killed, at least 60 remain in a serious condition and authorities have warned more could die.\nMany of those killed and wounded came from Krasnogorsk, Khimki and other nearby towns on Moscow's north-western fringe.\nWho are the attackers?\nIt appears that those who carried out the attack managed to escape the inferno and mayhem they left behind and a manhunt began.\nRussian MP Alexander Khinshtein said the attackers fled in a white Renault car. According to him, police tried to stop the vehicle in the Bryansk region, about 340km (210 miles) from Moscow, managing to arrest two people as the others fled.\nSome 14 hours after the first reports of shooting, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) announced 11 people had been arrested, including four \"directly involved\".\nFour suspects were dragged into a court in Moscow on Sunday and named as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov.\nAll were charged with an act of terrorism and probably face life in prison.\nRussia's state news agency Tass said all four were from Tajikistan.\nWho was behind the attack?\nIn a brief statement on Friday, IS said it was behind the attack. On Saturday, it released a photograph of what it said were the four attackers - all masked.\nThe group later released highly graphic footage from the attack. The video, which has been verified by the BBC as genuine, shows one of the gunmen opening fire on several people. The BBC will not be broadcasting this video.\nRussian authorities have not commented on the IS claim, which comes two weeks after the US warned of a potential attack targeting \"large gatherings\" in Moscow. Russian officials have complained the US intelligence lacked specific detail.\nAnd last week, President Vladimir Putin said: \"Recent provocative statements by a number of official Westerns structures about the possibility of terrorist attacks in Russia... resembles outright blackmail and an intention to intimidate and destabilise our society.\"\nThe US had singled out Islamic State-Khorasanor IS-K, an offshoot which seeks to establish a Muslim caliphate across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Iran.\nColin Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst based in New York, was quoted by the New York Times as saying IS-K had been \"fixated\" on Russia for the past two years.\nHe said it \"accuses the Kremlin of having Muslim blood in its hands, referencing Moscow's interventions in Afghanistan, Chechnya and Syria\".\nWhile the Russian authorities have not commented on the IS claim, Mr Putin said the assailants were caught as they were trying to flee to Ukraine.\n\"Based on preliminary information, a window for crossing the border was prepared for them by the Ukrainian side,\" Mr Putin said.\nUkraine swiftly dismissed the Russian claims as \"absolutely untenable and absurd\".\nBBC Verify has been able to match details of two of the alleged attackers who ap",
    "In 2023, EDF took over 900 chalets at Pontins Brean Sands in Somerset to house construction workers building Hinkley Point C. At the time, the energy firm promised \"year-round\" spending by staff but local traders say the move has \"decimated\" the seaside resort.\nBuilding Britain's first new nuclear power station for 30 years is a huge deal for the area. The budget, now around \u00c2\u00a346bn, dwarfs the county's economy. Over \u00c2\u00a31bn has been spent with local firms supplying the project.\nBut when EDF commandeered the old seaside holiday camp at Brean Sands, many feared it would be the first time Hinkley Point C had damaged local trade.\nSurely tired nuclear builders would not spend money in the seaside resort like families on holiday had?\nWhen I spoke to Hinkley managers in 2023, they promised their scheme would in fact \"bring more people to Brean\".\nAndrew Cockroft runs the \"stakeholder engagement\" programme at Hinkley Point C, the biggest construction programme in Europe.\nHis team spent \u00c2\u00a32m repainting and refurbishing the tired Pontins chalets, and hired a marketing agency to promote the resort nationwide.\nBecause their 900 workers would stay all year, it would mean \"business all year round for the local traders.\"\nSo as Brean reopens for the Easter weekend, I asked people if they had seen any business from the nuclear builders.\n\"No,\" said Alan House, who runs Unity Holiday Resort and chairs the tourism association, Discover Brean.\n\"Generally speaking they're all either on-shift or asleep.\n\"They don't tend to come out into the local economy, we haven't seen anything of them over the winter at all.\"\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, none have been in Charles Holland's business, even though it is right across the road.\nHis amusement arcade offers traditional slot machines and penny pushers, alongside brand new video games.\n\"They keep themselves to themselves, I think they're here to work really,\" he said.\n\"We have lost trade yes, it has been a big thing for us losing the Pontins customers.\"\nI hear the same story in every business on his parade.\nA fish and chip shop, a caf\u00c3\u00a9, a convenience store; all the classics of the English seaside resort.\nAnd yes, your correspondent can confirm that nuclear construction workers have no interest in buckets and spades at the UK's oldest Pontins resort.\nIt first opened in 1946 and was a former US Army base during World War II before its life as a holiday resort, which ended when EDF workers moved in.\nBrian Davies can put figures on the losses. For decades he has run a weekend market at Brean, with stalls selling arts and crafts, Somerset cakes, fudge and treats, everything people want on a seaside holiday.\n\"Last year we started the season with 43 stalls,\" he told me.\n\"We ended it with 21. Traders just weren't taking the money.\"\n'Pontins fed us'\nPontins Brean Sands has 900 chalets, out of a total of 2,000 self-catering chalets available to rent in Brean.\nAlthough thousands more people own their own static caravans, bring touring vans or camp in the summer, Pontins used to provide nearly half of the beds rented by the week.\n\"Pontins fed us, basically,\" Mr Davies said.\n\"There are 900 full-time workers in there, and there used to be 3,000 people that were on holiday. Of course we've lost money.\"\nPrivately, several business owners tell me it has been a hard winter. Takings were down so badly last year some considered closing altogether. But now the season has come again, and they are keen to \"get on with it\", as Mr House puts it.\nOne of the most badly hit was the theme park. Phil Booth has swapped thrill-seeking holidaymakers for tired builders, and few of them fancy a ride on his rollercoasters.\n\"It has taken a chunk of our earnings, yes,\" he tells me.\nBut small firms are adaptable, and if there are fewer people staying for the whole week, this year Brean Theme Park is targeting day-trippers.\nMr Booth explained: \"We have added some new rides, upgraded the rollercoaster, and we've changed our pricing structure. A new day pass gives you all the rides, and a meal.\"\nManagers at Hinkley Point C reject the suggestion that their takeover of Pontins is to blame for the drop in tourism.\nMr Cockroft said: \"Brean was not alone in experiencing a visitor downturn last summer - thousands of tourism businesses across the south west reported reduced numbers and income.\n\"The particularly wet peak months of July and August, combined with the cost-of-living crisis, deterred many families.\"\nDespite the loss of the Pontins beds, Brean is still the second largest camping and caravan resort in the UK, and the busiest tourism area in Somerset. As shops and cafes, holiday parks and amusement arcades polish themselves up for the new season, they are hoping for better weather this year.\nStressing the positives, Alan House put it like this: \"Everyone has had enough of the horrible winter weather, and just wants to get out an enjoy the great British seaside.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and, X .

    "A man has been jailed for nine years for killing a mature student with a car while being pursued by police.\nOshada Jayasundera, 31, of Nottingham Trent University, was hit on the A60 Huntingdon Street in Nottingham city centre in the early hours of 13 December and died at the scene.\nJoshua Gregory, 27, was sentenced on Thursday after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving.\nThe victim's brother travelled from Sri Lanka to speak at the hearing.\nAt Nottingham Crown Court, Recorder Paul Mann KC said Gregory had treated the city centre \"like a race track\", describing his dangerous driving as \"prolonged, persistent and deliberate\".\nHe added Mr Jayasundera's family would have to bear his loss \"every day for the rest of their lives\".\nThe court heard Mr Jayasundera had been returning home from a birthday party with friends when he was struck by the Ford Focus, which Gregory had taken from the garage where he worked without permission from his employer and without insurance.\nHis car was spotted by officers swerving in Sherwood Rise at about 03:10 GMT, prompting them to activate their blue lights, prosecutors said.\nDuring the pursuit, Gregory reached speeds in excess of 80mph in a 30mph zone and the force of the collision was such that Mr Jayasundera's body was propelled 46m (150ft).\nMr Mann said: \"Mercifully, his death was instantaneous.\"\nShortly after hitting Mr Jayasundera, Gregory collided with a central reservation and abandoned the car.\nHe was pursued on foot and refused to take an alcohol breath test when caught by officers, before making a second escape attempt.\nThe court was shown body-worn camera footage of an officer asking Gregory if he was drunk, to which he replied \"yeah\".\nThe victim's brother travelled from Sri Lanka with his father and read a statement at the hearing which described Mr Jayasundera as \"studious and humble\".\nHe told the court the process of repatriating his brother, which took about a month, was \"a time of great despair\", adding his mother was \"emotionally shattered to see her son arriving home in a way she had never dreamt of\".\nA statement issued by Mr Jayasundera's family via Nottinghamshire Police said: \"Our family will never recover from this loss for the rest of our lives.\n\"We will have to live with it, suffering every single second, every minute, every hour, every day, every week, and all the years to come.\"\nThe defence read a letter written by Gregory to the victim's family, which said he was \"fully aware of the pain and anguish this has caused\".\nIn addition to his prison sentence, Gregory, of Westfield Road, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, also received a 12-year driving ban.\nAn Independent Office for Police Conduct investigation into Nottinghamshire Police's pursuit of Gregory concluded the actions and decisions of all officers involved were \"reasonable\" and \"appropriate\".\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "South Africa is heading for a general election in late May, with some polls suggesting the governing African National Congress (ANC) could get less than 50% of the vote for the first time in 30 years.\nMounting criticism of the party that led the fight against apartheid under the late Nelson Mandela has chipped away at its support, raising the possibility of a coalition government.\nWhen is South Africa's election?\nOn 29 May, nearly 28 million South African registered voters have the chance to elect representatives to the national and provincial parliaments.\nIt will be the country's seventh democratic general election.\nThey have taken place every five years since 1994, when white-minority rule ended and the ANC came to power.\nWhat is at stake for the ANC and what are its policies?\nThe ANC, now led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, is under growing pressure.\nStubbornly high unemployment, which hit 32% last year, persistent economic inequalities, corruption allegations and frequent power cuts have reduced its popularity.\nHigh levels of violent crime - on average 130 rapes and 80 murders a day in the last three months of 2023 - have also dented confidence in the authorities.\nBut the ANC says it is working to fix these problems.\nAnd it is urging people not to throw away gains made since the end of apartheid. The party says poverty levels have fallen, a greater proportion of South Africans live in decent homes and access to healthcare has improved.\nThe ANC has promised to create millions more jobs over the next five years, to boost investment, support the private sector and end corruption.\nWhat are the DA and EFF opposition parties offering?\nThe main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) says the \"country is in crisis\".\nIt wants to liberalise the economy, including a move towards greater privatisation.\nIt has pledged to create two million new jobs, end power cuts and \"halve the rate of violent crime\".\nTo address unemployment and inequality, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) - the third largest party in parliament - has radical economic solutions.\nThe party argues that the ANC has not redressed the racial economic imbalances of apartheid. It plans to redistribute land to the less well off.\nThe EFF also wants to nationalise mines, banks and other key parts of the economy, arguing that the wealth of the country would then be used to benefit the majority of the population.\nWhat about Jacob Zuma and the MK party?\nDisgruntled former President Jacob Zuma - who was ousted by Mr Ramaphosa amid corruption allegations that he denies and later jailed for defying a court order - has thrown his considerable political weight behind a fresh rival to the ANC.\nThe uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) party, which has taken its name from the ANC's former armed wing, adds further unpredictability to the race. It could make a strong showing in Mr Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal.\nIn a brief manifesto it pledges to transform South Africa, including an aim to create five million jobs.\nWho could be South Africa's next president?\nSouth Africans do not vote for a president.\nInstead they elect the 400 members of the National Assembly, who go on to vote for a new head of state within 30 days of the general election.\nAs a result, there are no presidential candidates as such, but each party leader fronts their national campaign and their portrait will appear on the ballot paper.\nThe ANC's President Ramaphosa , the DA's John Steenhuisen and the EFF's Julius Malema will all feature prominently.\nThe leader of whichever party can muster a majority in the National Assembly after the election would be expected to become the next president.\nHow does the election work?\nThe proportion of seats that parties are allocated in the 400-member National Assembly is directly related to their share of the vote.\nIn 2024, independent candidates will be included for the first time.\nThis means that South Africans will cast three votes:\nHow would a coalition be formed in South Africa?\nThe constitution does not spell out how a coalition could be formed.\nBut assuming the ANC remains the largest party, smaller groupings could informally agree to support an ANC government on a vote-by-vote basis in return for some concessions.\nOr, at the other end of possibilities, the ANC could enter a formal coalition with some parties, including a written agreement outlining legislative plans and the distribution of cabinet posts.\nAny other party would face the same choices.\nBut there is also a possibility of an opposition coalition.\nIn a pre-election deal, a group of parties - led by the DA - has signed up to what has been called the Multi-Party Charter for South Africa. If together they get more than 50% of the seats, they have already agreed to form a coalition. The agreement does not include the EFF.\nMore South Africa stories from the BBC:",

    "Transport officials have asked commuters to \"bear with us\" as the return of locally-controlled buses continues across Greater Manchester.\nIt follows the launch of the Bee Network in September , which marked the first time bus deregulation had been reversed in England.\nThe second phase of the rollout began in Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford and north Manchester on Sunday.\nOfficials said they \"learnt lessons\" from disruption after autumn's launch .\nSome buses arrived late or did not turn up when the network began last September in Bolton, Wigan and parts of Bury, Salford and Manchester.\nVernon Everitt, transport commissioner for Greater Manchester, said: \"I think a lot of the teething problems in tranche one were purely around an unfamiliarity with routes - that's less of a case in this tranche.\"\nHe said there would be \"less reliance on agency drivers\" in the second phase.\n\"The process here is still quite complex so I would ask people to bear with us in the early days because it could be that not everything goes perfectly.\"\nMore yellow electric buses will replace older diesel vehicles as part of plans to cut carbon emissions and improve air quality.\nIn February , the region's mayor Andy Burnham said a reimbursement scheme would be available for passengers facing higher ticket prices as more buses come under local control.\nManaged by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), the services will be operated by Stagecoach, First and Diamond Bus under a franchise agreement.\nOfficials previously said the locally-controlled Bee Network means commuters will have a \"much greater say\", with punctuality, reliability and complaints impacting what operators get paid.\nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Internet-based radio station Severn FM has announced its closure after nearly 13 years of service.\nThe station, which has been owned and operated by Ringtone.net Ltd for 11 years, said it is unable to continue due to resource restrictions.\nAndy Clarke, who set up the 24-hour station in 2011, is now funding operations himself until the station goes off air on 30 June this year.\nHe said: \"I'm sure I'll shed a tear as it's been a big part of my life.\"\nThe station has hosted shows such as 'Up with the Rooster' and 'Severn Bore Breakfast Show', presented by Paul Alcock and Mr Clarke.\nThe latter program has featured celebrities such as Jools Holland, who was their first guest on the program, Graham Gouldman from the band 10cc and the late singer-songwriter Steve Harley.\n\"It is such a buzz,\" Mr Clarke said.\nThe founder has also sited lack of flexibility within Ofcom to look at sustainable FM delivery as part of the reason for the closure.\n\"If I had been able to apply for a small-scale DAB multiplex licence I could have made Severn FM fully self sufficient and I wouldn't be closing it now,\" he said.\nAn Ofcom spokesperson said: \"Over the last 15 years Ofcom has issued more than 300 community radio services on analogue frequencies.\n\"In 2020, we turned our attention to the roll out of small-scale DAB - and this has resulted in quickly delivering more local services to audiences across the UK.\n\"We believe this demonstrates our continued commitment to local radio, including in the regions, and we plan to review our licensing priorities again this summer.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Wiltshire Council and Salisbury Reds have been awarded \u00c2\u00a311.4m of funding for an electric buses project in the city.\nThe investment will bring 23 new electric buses to Salisbury in 2026.\nThe two organisations worked in partnership to bid for the funding, with both providing financial contributions to make up the project value.\nCabinet member for transport Tamara Reay said it was \"fantastic\" the partnership attracted this investment.\nAward by the Department for Transport's (DfT) ZEBRA (Zero Emissions Bus Regional Area), the investment not only includes the purchase of the buses, but also the electric charging infrastructure which will be installed at Salisbury Reds' depot.\nThe 23 electric buses will run on major city routes and surrounding areas, including services to and from Stonehenge and the city's park and ride sites.\n\"We have committed to improving our bus network across the county, and Salisbury, with its many bus routes in the city, is the perfect place to bring the first electric buses to Wiltshire,\" Ms Reay said.\nSalisbury Reds will now work on implementing this plan, starting with the installation of the bus charging infrastructure, and people will start to see the new electric buses in the city from 2026, she added.\nAndrew Wickham, the managing director of Salisbury Reds, said that this is very exciting news and will put Salisbury right at the forefront of sustainable transport.\nThe 23 new buses will add to the three Salisbury Reds already have, he added.\nEach new bus will be equipped with technology for contactless payments, USB charging points for all seats, and next stop audio and visual announcements. The buses will also have a fully accessible wheelchair ramp, audio loops, dementia-friendly internal colour schemes and CCTV for added security.\nMr Wickham said the Salisbury depot is already equipped to charge the three electric park-and-ride buses, and they will be upgrading the charging infrastructure to accommodate the new fleet.\n\"All of this will have a significant impact on Salisbury's overall carbon emissions. It will also improve air quality here,\" he said.\n\"The success of this bid is testament to the excellent working relationship we enjoy with Wiltshire Council - and it gives us a wonderful opportunity to make Salisbury's transport the envy of other areas of the United Kingdom and, indeed, the World,\" Mr Wickham said.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Presenter Nicky Campbell said he wept in his wife's arms after a sheriff found a private school teacher abused him and others over a 20-year period.\nJohn Brownlee beat students at Edinburgh Academy with wooden bats and pushed one boy down a flight of stairs during a campaign of physical violence.\nVictims described the teacher, now 89, as a \"psychopath\" and a \"sadist\".\nAn examination of facts hearing concluded earlier after he was deemed medically unfit to stand trial.\nMr Campbell, 62, was among a number of former pupils who gave evidence during the hearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.\nHe was a pupil at the fee-paying school between 1966 and 1978, from when he was aged five until he was 17.\nHe recalled Brownlee as an \"arbitrarily violent man\" who regularly struck students with an 18in (46cm) long paddle known as a \"clacken\".\nHe also said Brownlee once forced him to the ground and performed a \"knuckle dance\" on the back of his skull.\nThe broadcaster said he felt unable to tell his adoptive parents about the incidents , because he knew they were stretching themselves financially in order to send him to the school.\nBut Mr Campbell said the sheriff's conclusion was a \"vindication\" of the abuse he and others suffered at Brownlee's hands.\n\"It's as if somebody has told the grown-ups and now, the grown-ups have believed us,\" he said.\n\"Today, I have been a 10-year-old boy again, I have been weeping in my wife's arms.\n\"Those memories of him are still with me, they come to me in the night. They are with others too.\"\nHe added: \"Today is a wonderful release. I bear no ill will to the Brownlee family at all. He is not a well man, but all we wanted was for people to say 'that did happen, and it should not have happened and it was wrong'.\"\nBrownlee 'enjoyed' abusing pupils\nOther pupils, who were boarders at the school, told the hearing that Brownlee seemed to \"enjoy\" inflicting pain.\nOne told how he tripped him at the top of a flight of stairs, causing him to fall down 15 steps.\nAnother described how a child was punished for having a \"dry toothbrush\" by being repeatedly thrown into a cold bath, then into a hot shower in front of other pupils.\nOn one occasion, a pupil, who was 10 at the time, said he was hit so hard in the head that he \"blacked out\" and had difficulty breathing when he woke up after Brownlee \"smashed him over the head\" and punched him in the stomach.\nThe evidence covered a period between 1967 and 1987.\n'Lifetime of damage'\nBrownlee was deemed unfit to stand trial last November.\nAn examination of the facts hearing was held without a jury before Sheriff Anderson in Edinburgh.\nIt gave the Crown and defence the opportunity to present evidence.\nThe Sheriff was then asked to determine whether or not the person accused carried out the actions.\nBrownlee will not face any punishment.\nOutside the court, Graeme Sneddon from the Edinburgh Academy Survivors Group read a statement describing Brownlee as a \"violent monster\" and said he had caused \"a lifetime of damage to everyone concerned\".\nHe said: \"Today's verdict after almost three weeks of evidence and a year of police investigations sends out a strong signal that the law will one day catch up with anyone who abuses children.\n\"Justice has been done today after a wait of over 50 years for some former pupils.\n\"Finally, we have been believed.\"\nMr Campbell paid tribute to the work of Edinburgh Academy rector Barry Welsh in creating a \"completely different\" environment at the school to the one he left.\nMr Welsh reiterated his apology to pupils who suffered abuse and praised the \"remarkable bravery\" shown by those who gave evidence during the hearing.\nHe said: \"Our commitment to facing up to the wrongs of the past remains unwavering.\n\"Many former pupils have shown remarkable bravery by giving evidence over several years, and we would like to reiterate our apology to all those affected by any abuse that occurred at our school.\"\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line",

    "Boeing boss Dave Calhoun will leave at the end of this year amid a deepening crisis over the firm's safety record.\nBoeing also said that the head of its commercial airlines division will retire immediately while its chairman will not stand for re-election.\nThe firm is under pressure after an unused door blew out of a Boeing 737 Max in January shortly after take-off.\nNo-one was injured but the firm's safety and quality control standards came under renewed scrutiny.\nMr Calhoun took on the chief executive role in early 2020 after the previous boss, Dennis Muilenburg, was ousted in the aftermath of one of the biggest scandals in Boeing's history.\nWithin the space of five months, two brand new 737 Max planes had been lost in almost identical accidents that claimed the lives of 346 passengers and crew.\nA board member at the time, after being made boss Mr Calhoun promised to strengthen Boeing's \"safety culture\" and \"rebuild trust\".\nHowever, in January this year a disused emergency exit door blew off a new Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off from Portland International Airport.\nAn initial report from the US National Transportation Safety Board concluded that four bolts meant to attach the door securely to the aircraft had not been fitted.\nBoeing is facing a criminal investigation into the incident itself, as well as legal action from passengers aboard the plane.\nMany analysts said a change in Boeing's leadership was overdue.\n\"A shake-up at the top is necessary,\" said Stewart Glickman, equity analyst at CFRA Research, adding that he believed the current crisis stemmed from problems in the firm's corporate culture that only fresh insight would be able to fix.\n\"I don't think you can change the culture with internal voices because I think this has been modus operandi for this company for too long.\"\nIn a letter to staff on Monday, Mr Calhoun described the Alaska Airlines incident as a \"watershed moment\" for Boeing and said it had to respond with \"humility and complete transparency\".\n\"The eyes of the world are on us, and I know that we will come through this moment a better company,\" he said.\nAir safety campaigner Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, said Mr Calhoun had had years to try to boost safety at the company.\n\"It's been one failure after the other,\" said Mr Pierson, who is now executive director at The Foundation for Aviation Safety.\n\"The company deserves much better leadership and the people who get on these airplanes deserve much better leadership.\"\nThe blowout had tested Boeing's relationships with its airline customers and regulators in Washington, reviving concerns that the company's corporate culture had focused on speed of production ahead of safety.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said earlier this month that a six-week audit of the 737 Max production process at Boeing and its supplier Spirit Aerosystems had found \"multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements\".\nAnother report into Boeing's safety culture by an expert panel found a \"disconnect\" between senior management and regular staff, as well as signs that staff were hesitant about reporting problems for fear of retaliation.\nAfter the two plane crashes in October 2018 and 2019, it was discovered that flawed flight control software caused the incidents - details of which Boeing was accused of deliberately concealing from regulators.\nThe company agreed to pay $2.5bn (\u00c2\u00a31.8bn) to settle fraud charges and admitted deception, though in later court hearings it formally pleaded not guilty.\nIt subsequently faced widespread accusations that it had put profits ahead of passengers' lives.\nMark Pegram, whose 25-year-old son Sam died when Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed in 2019, said Mr Calhoun had appeared to have been brought in to say what investors wanted to hear and \"not fix the cause of the problems that were making planes fall out of the sky\".\nHe said he was pleased by the change but disappointed it had taken so long.\n\"It's something we've been calling for for quite some time now,\" he said.\nThe crisis at Boeing has caused wider disruption in the travel industry as the company, one of the world's two major jet-makers, slows its manufacturing lines to try to get a grip on the problems.\nAirlines, including Ryanair, have warned of higher ticket prices and more limited flight schedules as they face delayed aircraft deliveries. On Monday, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said that the company \"welcomed\" Boeing's management changes, specifically the departure of Stan Deal will is leaving his role as head of the commercial airlines division immediately.\nMr O'Leary said: \"Stan Deal has done a great sales job for Boeing for many years but he is not the person to turnaround the operation in Seattle and that's where most of the problems have been in recent years.\"\nScott Hamilton, managing director of Seattle-based aircraft and econo",
    "A new police office has opened in a Leicestershire town following concerns raised by the community.\nThe office, at The Pavilion in Coventry Road, Lutterworth, officially opened on Monday - more than a decade after a police station closed in the town.\nAt a meeting last year, residents and the town council said they were worried about the lack of police presence.\nLeicestershire Police said the base would allow officers to have a \"more visible presence\".\nThe force said the town's police station closed in 2013 as an \"austerity measure\" along with many others, but was pleased to see them \"re-emerging\".\nThe new office, which was officially opened by Lutterworth town mayor David Jones, is not yet open to the public but an online appointment booking system is being looked into, it added.\nOfficers living in the town will be based there, meaning they do not have to travel to and from nearby Market Harborough, and the office will also be used on a daily basis by response officers.\nLutterworth Town Council said the new base would help reduce response times \"without the necessity of travelling from Market Harborough especially at night\".\nThe authority added it would also allow residents to arrange appointments to \"discuss concerns or raise issues relating to crime in and around Lutterworth and the surrounding villages as a centred approach\".\nInsp Liz Perry, the neighbourhood policing commander for Harborough and Wigston, said following the meeting in July, police worked with the town council to find a suitable location.\n\"Thanks to lots of hard work and support, we now have a brand-new office in The Pavilion right in the middle of Lutterworth, allowing my officers a more visible presence in the town,\" she said.\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .

    "Services provided by a county's music service could be hit after changes to its funding, an MP told the House of Commons.\nSir Michael Ellis said the increase in government grants for music lessons and performing groups in Northamptonshire could be wiped out by rising pension contributions.\nDuring an adjournment debate, he urged the government to rethink the policy.\nThe government said it would give the issue \"due consideration\".\nNorthamptonshire Music and Performing Arts Trust (NMPAT) provides music lessons at schools across Northamptonshire and Rutland, and runs county ensembles, orchestras and choirs.\nIt broke away from Northamptonshire County Council in 2012 and became an independent charity.\nIt receives a grant from the Department for Education (DoE) to run Northamptonshire's music hub, which is worth \u00c2\u00a31,130,000.\nThe recent teachers' pay award means NMPAT has to top-up its staff's pensions by \u00c2\u00a3500,000.\nDuring the adjournment debate, Sir Michael, the Conservative MP for Northampton North, told MPs: \"The total annual cost of employer contributions for the teachers' pension scheme alone will be \u00c2\u00a31,150,000.\n\"This will be greater than their national music grant\".\nHe added that NMPAT was now having to explore the idea of withdrawing its staff from the pension scheme.\nHe predicted that \"aspects of NMPAT services will suffer severely if their national music grant is swallowed entirely by the new pension contributions, as is likely to happen if nothing is done.\"\nMPs were told that the additional pension contributions for staff in schools were being fully funded by the government, but those for peripatetic teachers were not.\nSir Michael's Northampton South counterpart, Andrew Lewer, said: \"It would be quite wrong for music partnerships not to be able to offer teachers - reaching right across state schools in, for example, Northamptonshire - the same pensions as their less peripatetic fellow professionals.\"\nThe schools minister, Damian Hinds, responded by saying: \"The department is committed to providing funding to cover the increase in employer contribution rates for existing non-local authority hubs for the current academic year and officials are working to agree the precise amount.\"\nHe went on to say that a competition was under way to determine who would run music hubs for the next academic year, and funding discussions after that would give \"due consideration\" to the cost of pension contributions.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A string of sexual assault allegations have been made against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of the most successful music moguls in the history of rap.\nFour women, including his long-time partner Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, have filed lawsuits against the musician, accusing him of sexual and physical abuse.\nProducer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones filed a similar suit in February, alleging Combs abused him over a year-long period when he was living on the star's properties and working on his music.\nIn a statement issued last December, Combs defended himself against what he described as \"sickening allegations\" made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\n\"Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged,\" he said, adding he would fight to clear his name.\nHowever, in March 2024, federal agents raided two houses owned by the star \"as part of an ongoing investigation\" into sex trafficking.\nHis lawyer called the action an \"unprecedented ambush\" and a \"gross overuse of military-level force\", and maintained his client's innocence.\nCombs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - essentially rewrote the rules of hip-hop in the 1990s, but his career has been punctuated by controversies.\nHere is a timeline of his career and the accusations made against him.\n1969-89: Early life in New York\nSean John Combs was born in Harlem and raised in Mount Vernon, New York.\nHis mother, Janice, was a teacher's assistant, while his father Melvin was a former member of the US Air Force who became an associate of the drug-trafficker Frank Lucas, who later inspired the Ridley Scott film American Gangster.\nIn 1972, Melvin was fatally shot in his car during a drug transaction after being misidentified as an informant. Combs was just two, although he didn't learn the circumstances of his father's death until much later.\nRaised by his mother, he was a flashy kid who loved rap music and played football for the school team.\nAs a teenager, he danced in music videos for artists such as Diana Ross and the Fine Young Cannibals.\nTaking a cue from his mother, who worked multiple jobs to support Sean and his sister Keisha, he also worked six separate newspaper delivery routes, before enrolling to study business administration at Howard University.\nEarly 1990s: Party plans turn into tragedy\nAt university, Combs gained a reputation for throwing lavish parties, some of which attracted more than a thousand guests.\nAfter booking musicians such as Heavy D and Terry Riley to play at these gigs, he came to the attention of Uptown Records' founder Andre Harrell, who gave him an internship in New York.\nCombs eventually dropped out of university to work there full-time, guiding the early careers of artists including Mary J Blige and Jodeci.\nHowever, tragedy struck in 1991, when Combs co-promoted a celebrity basketball game and concert at City College of New York. Nearly 5,000 people showed up to the gymnasium, which could only fit 2,730 people. In the ensuing crush, nine people died and 29 people were injured.\nAn inquiry by the New York Mayor's Office cited Combs for hiring inexperienced security guards. However, the star and his lawyers maintained he was not responsible for security at the event.\n\"City College is something I deal with every day of my life,\" the musician said in 1998. \"But the things that I deal with can in no way measure up to the pain that the families deal with. I just pray for the families and pray for the children who lost their lives every day.\"\nNo criminal charges were filed over the tragedy, but family members of the people who died sued the promoters, the college and the city, accusing them of negligence.\nThe case was settled for $3.8m (\u00c2\u00a33m), of which Mr. Combs paid $750,000.\nMid-to-late 1990s: A new beginning\nWhile at Uptown, Combs signed a young Brooklyn rapper called Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G. - and started work on his debut album.\nBut his relationship with Harrell broke down and Combs was fired. He retaliated by setting up his own label, Bad Boy Records, and taking Biggie with him.\nThe star's debut album, Ready To Die, was hailed as an all-time rap classic, selling millions of copies and generating the multi-platinum singles Juicy and Big Poppa.\nCombs quickly expanded the Bad Boy roster, releasing hit albums by Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112 and Total.\nThe label's sound was slick and polished. Its biggest singles lifted chunky samples from well-known hits. The practice was frowned upon by hip-hop purists, but it was catnip to radio programmers.\n1997: Notorious B.I.G. is murdered\nIn March 1997, Biggie Smalls was gunned down in a drive-by shooting at the age of 24.\nThe murder has never been solved, but it has consistently been linked to the East-Coast-West-Coast rivalry that consumed rap music in the 1990s and which had previously claimed the life of Tupac Shakur.\nCombs, who had been travelling in the car behind his friend, poured his grief ",

    "It was just before eight o'clock and the auditorium at Crocus City Hall was filling up, ahead of a Friday night rock concert by veteran band Picnic.\n\"Some people in brown clothing, I don't know who they were - terrorists, military, whoever - broke into the auditorium and started shooting at people with assault rifles,\" said photographer Dave Primov, who saw the attack unfold from an upstairs balcony.\nWarning: Some of the details of this story are graphic\nThe gunmen had just walked across the concourse outside the theatre, opening fire at random, killing and wounding members of the public as they walked in.\nSome 6,200 tickets had been sold for the concert, but security outside the entrance quickly melted away. One of four guards said his colleagues hid behind an advertising board: \"Those attackers passed 10m [30ft] away from us - they started shooting randomly at people on the ground floor.\"\nNo-one knew how many attackers there were. But video filmed from an upper floor shows four men walking separately with a few metres between them across the beige, marble-tiled floor.\nThe lead attacker aims point-blank at people huddled against the windows. These are the first victims of Russia's deadliest attack on civilians for years.\nMany of those killed and wounded came from Krasnogorsk, Khimki and other nearby towns on Moscow's north-western fringe.\nA second attacker then joins in, while a third calmly follows carrying a backpack. The fourth man hands him his weapon and they walk through the unguarded metal detectors towards the auditorium.\nOne woman was with her 11-year-old daughter, buying ice cream at a caf\u00c3\u00a9 near the entrance, when they heard the noise and someone shouted to get down on the floor.\n\"We rushed to the children, lay down and started setting up barricades from tables and chairs, and several wounded people came running to us,\" she told BBC Russian.\nInside the theatre, the concert had been due to start in just a few minutes and some thought the noise might be part of the act.\nSofiko Kvirikashvili heard what she initially thought was \"some kind of endless burst of firecrackers - I turned around in the hall once, then again. The third time, I realised everyone in the hall had started running away in all directions.\"\nDave Primov, the photographer, said there was a crush and a scene of panic. Some in the theatre tried to lie down between the seats, but with several gunmen opening fire in the stalls, that offered little protection.\nThose in the audience who could, headed for the stage. Others tried to find higher exits, only to find some of the doors locked. Eyewitnesses said there were elderly people as well as children there, all caught up in the attack.\nOne woman had been in one of the higher circles and ran down towards the stage, from where she saw a man in the stalls opening fire: \"We ran behind the curtain and one of the Crocus employees in uniform told us to run and we ran out into the car park without any winter clothes.\"\nMargarita Bunova had just got hold of opera glasses for the show when she heard what she thought were firecrackers, which then turned into rapid bursts that she and her husband identified as gunfire.\n\"Somebody said run downstairs and it was complete darkness... we could still hear bursts of shooting behind us by the time we got out.\"\nOne man in a VIP box told how he and others barricaded themselves in only to find smoke billowing through the theatre.\nAnother man, Vitaly, saw the attack unfolding from a balcony: \"They threw some petrol bombs, everything started burning.\"\nWhether it was a petrol bomb or another incendiary device, the flames spread rapidly.\nFirefighters could not get near the building because of the attack. The fire soon spread to the roof and could be seen across the skyline in Krasnogorsk. Part of the roof collapsed and the fire spread to the front of the building, gutting the top two floors.\nMany of those in the auditorium fled through the foyer. One graphic video shows people rushing down escalators past two bodies propped up against a sofa.\nAnother video shows people fleeing as the crackling of gunfire echoes around them. They make it to the relative safety of the back of the building, where some sit huddled and others hold on to each other as they file through corridors.\nFor a moment, a TV monitor shows the chaos on the front of the stage. There is no sign of Russian police or special forces anywhere in the building.\nThe survivors climbed a staircase and reached the Crocus City Hall's trade entrance. One man was seen retching, while others phoned loved ones and walked away.\nEva, an assistant to a dance group, was backstage when the attackers burst into the auditorium. \"We were in the dressing room, a crowd rushed past us. We heard noise and people running in the corridor; we grabbed our coats and ran with the crowd.\"\nInitially, all the members of the group, Picnic, were declared safe and well, but later unconfirmed reports suggested one of the musicians was unac",

    "Some people mark World Down's Syndrome Day by wearing odd socks but one group of parents from Northern Ireland has gone a step further by recording a music video.\nHowever, there are no pop stars or celebrities taking part.\nInstead all the performers are mums and dads of children with Down's syndrome.\nThey sang a cover of Natasha Bedingfield's Unwritten and released it this week to help raise awareness of the condition.\nCelebrating difference\nDown's syndrome results from being born with an extra chromosome, usually by chance because of a change in the sperm or egg before birth. There are estimated to be around 60,000 people with Down's syndrome in the UK.\nSara McNeill from Ahoghill, County Antrim, is mum to four-year-old Tom. She says the lyrics represent the Down's syndrome community really well.\n\"If you even think about the first verse it's like: 'I'm undefined, it's just the beginning, the pen's in my hand, ending unplanned',\" she said.\n\"This is just the start of our journey with our kids.\"\nShe believes the song, which coincided with World Down's Syndrome Day on Thursday, is also about celebrating difference \"and that's what we do with this extra chromosome\".\nBut she thinks - most importantly - the music video has \"brought all our families together to support each other through the challenges and the wins as well\".\nLack of opportunities\nThe parents are part of a new charity called Together21 NI.\nLaura Houtman, from Belfast, is mum to four-year-old Anna Rose. She said that before the group was set up they had felt there was a \"lack of social opportunities and get togethers and services for our little ones\".\nThey only came up with the idea for the charity a year ago, had their first meeting in October and already support 80 children with Down's syndrome and their families.\n\"We have to keep reminding ourselves that we are all parents, we're working, we have families, we have homes and obviously we have a child with a disability,\" she said, adding they have many more plans for the future.\n\"There's such a passion and it's such a vibrant group.\"\nFilling the gap\nLaura Mulholland from Hillsborough, County Down, is mum to four-year-old Toby.\nShe said she gets so much from the WhatsApp group created by the charity.\n\"There's constant questions being asked by other parents,\" she explained, which she has found so useful and she finds she can \"answer things for other people\" which makes her feel like she's helping out as well.\n\"Whenever Toby was born we were given information and leaflets and websites and charities\" but she said there was nothing like the group that is here now.\n\"To have had that at the early stages would have been a massive help.\"\nLaura, like all the parents in the group, wants to both raise awareness of Down's syndrome but also let other families know there is support out there for them.",
    "Allies of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Disney have reached a settlement agreement over how Walt Disney World is governed in the future.\nIt comes after a judge ruled in January that it was legal for the state to make changes to the amusement theme park's district government.\nA row between the two sides has been trundling on for almost two years.\nIt was sparked by Disney's criticism of a state law that restricted the teaching of sexuality in schools.\nIn a meeting on Wednesday, members of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District board approved the settlement agreement.\nJeff Vahle, president of Walt Disney World Resort, said in a statement that the company was pleased that a settlement had been reached.\n\"This agreement opens a new chapter of constructive engagement with the new leadership of the district and serves the interests of all parties by enabling significant continued investment and the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs and economic opportunity in the state,\" the Associated Press news agency quoted Mr Vahle as saying.\nThe two sides started feuding after Disney, under pressure from its staff, criticised the Parental Rights in Education Act - dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill by critics - which bans discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity for students in Florida.\nIn response to Disney's criticism, Mr DeSantis - who is a proponent of the law - passed legislation that stripped Disney of its self-governing authority - a power the company had for more than 50 years.\nThe move gave more power to Mr DeSantis, who now appoints members of a board that governs the park's 25,000 acres.\nBut before the board changed hands, Disney supporters on the board signed agreements with the company shifting control of some aspects at Disney World to the company - a move the district then sued Disney over. The company also countersued.\nUnder Wednesday's agreement, litigation counsel Paul Huck said at the board meeting that the company recognised that the signing over of control to Disney before the board changed hands was \"null and void\".\nThe city-sized theme park had been operated by Disney since 1971.",

    "A report criticising the handling of protests at a school \"makes for deeply disturbing reading\", an MP has said.\nA religious studies teacher at Batley Grammar School was forced into hiding in 2021 after showing a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad during a class.\nA review published on Monday found he was \"let down\" by the council, police and the trust running the school.\nKim Leadbeater, Labour MP for Batley and Spen, said the protest and the teacher's treatment was \"unacceptable\".\nThe independent review , led by government adviser Dame Sara Khan, examined threats to social cohesion and democratic resilience in the UK.\nIt highlighted the protests at the school in March 2021 as a \"harrowing example\" and called the teacher a \"victim of freedom-restricting harassment\".\nWhat sparked the protests in Batley?\nShortly after secondary schools had fully returned to classrooms after Covid-enforced home learning, the cartoon at the centre of the row was displayed in a religious studies lesson on 22 March 2021.\nParts of the Koran are taken to mean that neither Allah nor Muhammad can be captured in an image by human hand and any attempt to do so is seen as an insult.\nCrowds of protesters gathered outside the school grounds, with the situation snowballing and gaining national press attention.\nConcerns were raised about threats and intimidation towards school staff during the protest.\nSpeaking at the time, former Conservative Party chairwoman Baroness Warsi of Dewsbury said the debate had been hijacked by \"extremists on both sides\" to fuel a \"culture war\".\nDemonstrators attended again the following morning, but had dispersed by mid-afternoon.\nWhat has the Khan review found?\nDame Sara Khan's report, published on Monday, says:\nSource: The Khan Review\nHow has the area's MP reacted to the review?\nKim Leadbeater MP, who did not represent the Batley & Spen constituency when the protests took place, has said she she fully supports the recommendations of the Khan review - including a move to restrict protests outside schools .\nWhat the report said about the protests at Batley Grammar School \"makes for deeply disturbing reading\", according to Ms Leadbeater.\n\"I have made it very clear that the demonstrations outside the school and the teacher having been forced into hiding is completely unacceptable,\" she said.\n\"There can be absolutely no excuse for the intimidation and threats against him.\"\nMs Leadbeater added that she had contacted the teacher involved to offer help and support, with his wellbeing her \"absolute priority\".\nWhat have people in Batley said about the review?\nEmployment lawyer Yunus Lunat, who represented some of the parents whose children attended the lesson, said the report was right to highlight a lack of leadership.\n\"There was no information or communication about the lesson or what the contents of the lesson were and what the context of it was,\" he said.\n\"We speak in hindsight now, but it seems that the protests were wholly based on rumour and gossip.\"\nAbdul Ravat, a parent of a former pupil at the school, said: \"There was a lot of misinformation and fiction about what had really happened and probably unearthed other issues arising from that snapshot of what happened at the school.\n\"Unfortunately it highlighted some weaknesses within that school structure. The governing body must have a diversity of skills, thoughts and opinions that govern the school environment from the community it operates with.\"\nThe parent added the \"school's reputation as a teaching establishment is not in question\" and said it remained popular in the area.\nMeanwhile, recalling the protests three years ago, a 70-year-old Batley resident, who did not want to be identified, said: \"I remember coming home from working in Morley and my bus comes down past the grammar school.\n\"I remember it was a nightmare - traffic was horrendous. I think there are other ways of doing it.\n\"Why couldn't they have sorted it out behind closed doors instead of bringing it on to everyone else?\"\nHer husband, 73, said he supported the review's call to create an exclusion zone for protesting outside schools.\n\"I don't think they should happen outside schools. It doesn't set a good example for the children does it?\" he said.\nA 24-year-old Batley man, who also did not wish to be identified, said: \"It's a pain for parents when they come and get their kids and you've got a load of people outside shouting.\"\n\"Pupils and teachers shouldn't have to be dealing with that along with what's going on in school,\" he added.\nHow have those criticised in the review responded?\nWest Yorkshire Police has said: \"Threatening behaviour is taken seriously and measures were put in place to manage this incident and the repercussions which resulted from it.\n\"[We] work hard to engage with all communities within its policing area, investing in Neighbourhood Policing Teams and specialist investigators to investigate offences and reduce tensions which may arise as swiftly as possible.\"\nBatley Multi Acad",
    "Edinburgh's Filmhouse will reopen this year after securing a \u00c2\u00a31.5m grant.\nThe independent cinema was forced to close in October 2022 after its parent company Centre for the Moving Image (CMI) collapsed into administration.\nBut a campaign backed by actors, film makers and cinema goers has now been awarded UK government cash with the aim of reopening the doors in the autumn.\nThe group is hopeful it can agree a lease with building owners Caledonian Heritable in May.\nThe cinema, on Lothian Road, opened inside the B-listed former church in 1979.\nCampaigners, under the name Filmhouse Edinburgh Ltd, plan to refurbish all three theatres and the caf\u00c3\u00a9 bar and introduce a fourth, 22-seat screen courtesy of funding from the UK government's levelling-up fund alongside money from Screen Scotland and City of Edinburgh Council.\nA crowdfunding appeal is also close to reaching its \u00c2\u00a3300,000 target.\nTrustee Ginnie Atkinson said there was still funding to raise but added that the campaigners were confident they could raise the outstanding capital.\n\"This is absolutely transformational,\" she said. \"When we applied the amount was aspirational. We have to attract new audiences and make it a modern, comfortable cinema experience.\n\"The seating is 22 years old and in some of the screens, there isn't even room to cross your legs so we need to offer better.\nShe said she believed the Filmhouse would offer something unique to other cinemas in terms of its programme, and could win back audiences.\nShe said: \"The support we had in our fundraising campaign shows the huge number of communities we connect to, international students, film students, baby boomers, those who've gone on to work in the industry or ordinary punters.\"\nToo late for Film Festival\nThe cinema will face the same competition as it did before it closed in 2022 from streaming services and other cinemas.\nThe group is hopeful a 33% rise in cinema going since 2022 will also help and it is still exploring options regarding pricing, including \"pay what you can\".\nAbout 100 jobs were lost when the cinema collapsed into administration.\nAnother independent cinema, the Belmont, in Aberdeen, was also closed.\nThe aspirational opening date of 6 October will be too late for this year's Edinburgh International Film Festival, which also closed down as a result of  CMI's demise .\nLast year saw a slimmed down, temporary programme and details of the 2024 event, under a new organisation have yet to be announced.\nDavid Smith, director of Screen Scotland said \"That we will have the Filmhouse back, and better than ever is a tremendous outcome and all credit goes to the hardworking team that held on to that possibility and made it a reality across the last 18 months.\"\nNo one doubts the passionate support for Filmhouse.\nSince its sudden closure in October 2022, more than two and a half thousand donations have been been made to the campaign to reopen, ranging from \u00c2\u00a32 to \u00c2\u00a35,000.\nThe \u00c2\u00a31.5m from the UK government gives the project the momentum it needs to move forward but the challenges are far from over.\nThe circumstances which caused CMI to fold, along with the Filmhouse, the Belmont in Aberdeen, and the Edinburgh International Film Festival have never been made public.\nTheir statement at the time referenced cost of living, energy prices and a decline in cinema, going post pandemic. Although Filmhouse Edinburgh Ltd is a new charitable organisation, it will face many of the same problems.\nCinema going may be gradually increasing but Filmhouse will have to win back an audience which has wandered elsewhere in the last two years.\nTo do that, they will have to bring the surroundings up to scratch, improve accessibility and secure a unique programme of films which can't be found anywhere else in the capital.\nThe new grant was in recognition of the huge support Filmhouse has from \"the community\". It's no ordinary community, taking in locals, students, international visitors, filmmakers and festival goers but in order for Filmhouse to survive and thrive, it needs to translate the passion of that community into support.\nThe outcry around the closure showed the fragile nature of even the most celebrated institutions, as well as a reminder that if you don't use it, you risk losing it.",
    "The boss of Centrica, the energy giant which owns British Gas, has seen his pay package rise by almost \u00c2\u00a34m.\nChris O'Shea's remuneration was \u00c2\u00a38.2m in 2023, up from \u00c2\u00a34.5m in 2022, according to the firm's annual report.\nThe package consists of a salary of \u00c2\u00a3810,000, a \u00c2\u00a31.4m annual bonus and \u00c2\u00a35.9m in long-term bonus, pension and benefits.\nIn January, Mr O'Shea told the BBC his pay was \"impossible to justify\".\nMost of the increase, compared to 2022, comes from Mr O'Shea's long-term bonus, which mainly rose due to Centrica's soaring share price over the past three years.\nCarol Arrowsmith, the chair of Centrica's remuneration committee, said the company needed to attract and retain \"high performing executives who can lead this large and complex business\".\nShe added that his pay was \"based on the terms he was appointed on\", and that \"the structure of the package was approved by our shareholders, and it is consistent with similar companies\".\nIn 2023 British Gas announced profits had increased tenfold to \u00c2\u00a3750m after regulator Ofgem allowed it to take a bigger slice of profits to recoup \u00c2\u00a3500m it lost in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nCentrica said its profits fell to a still-large \u00c2\u00a32.8bn after oil and gas prices dropped back to 2022 levels.\nIn January, Mr O'Shea described his combination of salary, bonus and shares as \"a huge amount of money\" and said he was \"incredibly fortunate\".\nDuring that interview Mr O'Shea pointed out that he did not set his pay and admitted that while energy customers were struggling with their bills \"you can't justify a salary of that size\".\nFrom April, the typical annual energy bill will fall to \u00c2\u00a31,690 to the lowest for two years under a new price cap set by Ofgem.\nIt means a drop of \u00c2\u00a3238 a year, or around \u00c2\u00a320 a month, for a household using a typical amount of energy.\nEnergy prices are at their lowest level since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nHowever, even after April's drop, bills will remain well above pre-pandemic levels.\nThe regulator's price cap affects 29 million households in England, Wales and Scotland. Rules are different in Northern Ireland, where prices are also falling.\nOfgem sets the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity but not the total bill - so if you use more, you will pay more.",
    "A father has spoken of his \"horror\" after his son, who was jailed in the UK for fighting for Putin has returned to Ukraine after his release.\nBen Stimson, from Oldham, along with Aiden Minnis, from Wiltshire, are understood to be in the Donbas region, which is under Russian occupation.\nStimson was previously jailed in the UK in 2015 for joining pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine.\nStimson's father said he had cut communication with his son.\nIn a video posted to Youtube, Stimson says: \"Every man takes his choice, a lot of us, the foreign volunteers, have chosen to come over to this side, to the Russian side.\"\n'Horrified'\nThe BBC spoke to Mr Stimson's father, Martin Stimson, who said he had cut off all communication with his son and was \"horrified\" at hearing he was fighting for Russia.\nHe said: \"I have no control over him, he's a 48-year-old man.\"\nMinnis, from Chippenham, had previously been jailed for assault and was linked to the far-right National Front.\nThe two men were believed to be the first British nationals fighting for Russian president Vladimir Putin since he ordered the full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nPhilip Ingram, a former senior British military intelligence officer, told BBC North West Tonight that the decision to fight for Russia was \"signing your own death warrant\".\nHe said despite their criminal convictions, neither man would likely have been stopped from leaving the country if they held valid passports.\n'Cannon fodder'\nMr Ingram said the Russian military leadership were using their troops as \"cannon fodder\" in \"human waves\" against Ukrainian defences.\nHe suggested the fact the men had posted videos and images onto social media could provide Ukrainian intelligence services with information, which could \"impact their life expectancies\".\nA spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said: \"Reports of British nationals taking part in Putin's illegal invasion are shocking and their alleged actions are reprehensible.\n\"Those who travel from the UK to conflict zones to engage in unlawful activity should expect to be investigated upon their return.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Ten residents on one street have been given two months to leave their homes after being served no-fault eviction notices by a social housing landlord.\nNearly every tenant on Lake House Close in Weaverham, Cheshire, including two 88-year-olds, were sent letters from Cedar Care Group saying they did not meet the criteria to live there.\nThe company said the homes were for vulnerable people.\nResidents said they were devastated and had nowhere else to go.\nCedar Care Group operates as a social enterprise which provides homes for people who require additional support.\nIt said the ten Weaverham residents should never have been living in these homes, which was \"a matter of deep regret\".\nDoreen Barker-Lamb, 88, said she could not stop crying ever since she opened the letter which said she has just six weeks to leave her home of 10 years.\nHer eviction notice said she needed to be out of the bungalow by 12 May.\n\"It's the worst feeling I have ever had in my life. I can't sleep. I don't want to eat. I just feel sick. I don't think I'd have the energy to move,\" she said.\n\"I don't know what to do next.\"\nShe added: \"I do wish they'd think again and help us. I've never missed a rent or anything.

My mum at her age - you can't do that to somebody.\"\nJonathan Jones intercepted an eviction notice on behalf of his 88-year-old father who has serious health issues.\n\"If he had read that letter, the shock in the worst case scenario could have killed him,\" he said.\n\"Receiving a letter like that is a shock for anybody and someone of 88, it's just appalling.\"\nGlen Petch, 61, a gardener, has also been served an eviction notice saying he has to leave by 30 April after living there for three and a half years.\nHe said: \"It makes you feel very desperate and insecure.\n\"Not having a place to live alters everything - your health, your prospect, your outlook on years coming up.\"\nAs well as being evicted he told BBC North West Tonight he also had black mould in his home since he moved in and no hot water, apart from an electric shower, for two years.\nHe said although he had repeatedly complained, no repairs had been made.\nCedar Care Group said it would refurbish homes that were not maintained by the previous landlord\nWeaver Vale MP Mike Amesbury, who is also shadow homelessness minister, said: \"It's disgusting and immoral the way people have been treated and by a social enterprise which has the word 'care' in its name.\nThe Labour MP urged Cedar Care to \"think again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and do the right thing\" by withdrawing the Section 21 notices.\nCedar Care Group said the properties were not \"full life homes\" and were for vulnerable people identified by the council as needing extra support.\nIt said these ten tenants did not fall into those categories and should never have been living there.\n\"This is a matter of deep regret,\" it said.\nThe social housing group said if the council advised that residents did require support they could move back in.\nCheshire West and Chester Council said it had not been contacted by Cedar Care and was looking into the situation.\n'Empowering tenants'\nA government bill to ban landlords from evicting tenants without reason was first introduced last May.\nIt would mean that landlords could evict tenants in England only under certain circumstances, including when they wish to sell the property or when they or a close family member want to move in.\nBut the bill has not passed through the House of Commons yet.\nA Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokeswoman said: \"Our landmark Renters (Reform) bill is progressing through Parliament.\n\"It will deliver a fairer private rented sector for both responsible tenants and good-faith landlords.\n\"The Bill will abolish section 21 evictions - giving people more security in their homes and empowering them to challenge poor practices.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "A Tory MSP has threatened legal action against Police Scotland after the force logged a social media comment he made as a \"hate incident\".\nMurdo Fraser likened identifying as non-binary to identifying \"as a cat\", in relation to Scottish government equality policies last November.\nPolice decided no crime had been committed after a complaint was made.\nThe force also said their recording helps \"monitor tensions\" in communities and informs police responses.\nHowever Mr Fraser has accused police of acting unlawfully by recording it as a hate incident.\nHis complaint comes ahead of new hate crime legislation taking effect in Scotland from 1 April.\nThe dispute began when Mr Fraser commented on a newspaper article about the Scottish government's Non-Binary Equality Action Plan last November.\nHe posted: \"Choosing to identify as 'non-binary' is as valid as choosing to identify as a cat. I'm not sure governments should be spending time on action plans for either.\"\nA member of the public made a complaint about the post. After considering the complaint, Police Scotland decided that he had not committed a crime.\nBut the post was recorded as a \"hate incident\", though this was not attached to Mr Fraser's name.\nA separate complaint was later made with the Scottish Parliament's ethical standards commissioner, citing the police reference number. This alerted Mr Fraser to the fact that a \"hate incident\" had been recorded.\nThe commissioner judged that there did not appear to be a breach of the code of conduct for MSPs.\nLegal action\nIn a letter to Police Scotland, Mr Fraser accuses the force of breaching the Human Rights Act, the Data Protection Act and the Equality Act as well as breaching Hate Crime National Guidance (HCNG).\nThe mid-Scotland and Fife MSP describes the guidance as empowering police forces to record non-crime hate incidents and called on the force to make changes to it, as well as to delete the hate incident.\nHe has threatened legal action if this does not happen.\nMr Fraser said: \"Police Scotland has behaved not just outrageously, but unlawfully according to the legal advice obtained by the Free Speech Union.\n\"This is Police Scotland attacking free speech - but it is more sinister than that. My tweet wasn't pointing a finger at an individual - it was critical of a Scottish government policy.\"\nMr Fraser said police forces in England and Wales had decided not to record non-criminal hate incidents, but said Police Scotland has not done that.\nNew hate laws\nMr Fraser's complaint pre-dates the introduction of the Scottish government's new Hate and Public Order (Scotland) Act - which comes into force on 1 April.\nIt criminalises threatening or abusive behaviour which is intended to stir up hatred based on certain characteristics including age, disability, sexual orientation and transgender identity.\nPolice Scotland said inquiries were carried out after a report was made about an offensive tweet on 20 November - it said no criminality was established..\nA spokesperson said: \"The incident was recorded as a non-crime hate incident. Police Scotland have received a complaint relating to this matter which has been passed to the Professional Standards Department for assessment.\n\"Hate incidents are not recorded against alleged perpetrators. Recording is victim-focused and the process has been part of policing for many years. It helps us monitor tensions within communities enabling appropriate police responses and helps to build community confidence.\n\"Seemingly low level or minor events can have a significant impact on someone who may already be very vulnerable.\"\nNew hate crime laws will take effect in Scotland from the beginning of next week.\nBut it's important to stress this particular set of events has happened under the current system - it has nothing to do with the recent Hate Crime Act.\nThough with its implementation looming, those who oppose this new legislation are getting more vocal in their criticism. And debates about hate crime and free speech are getting louder in Scotland.\nCritics of the new legislation say it will clamp down on dissenting opinion, and that police will be \"swamped\" with complaints.\nBut the first minister has vigorously defended it, saying it will only affect individuals who look to stir up hatred against certain groups.\nThese laws aren't even operational yet, but we're getting a clear idea of how politically charged an issue this is.",
    "Footballer Maddy Cusack played for teams including Birmingham City and Aston Villa, but she referred to West Hallam as her \"real club\".\nShe was a member of the junior squad as a child - one of two female players at the time.\nSo it seemed fitting for the small team to stage a memorial game in honour of the Sheffield United midfielder, who died last year aged 27.\nFormer team-mates, childhood friends, and Maddy's brother Richard were among those who took part in Saturday's charity match in Ilkeston, Derbyshire.\nMany of them hadn't stepped on a pitch in years but wanted to get involved.\nMaddy's sister Olivia says it was heart-warming to see the number of Maddy's former team-mates and friends who turned up.\n\"I can't believe the amount that have come back and wanted to do it,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.\n\"A lot of them don't play football now and haven't put their boots on for a good few years.\"\nBut, for Maddy's family, the game was still tough.\n\"It is difficult because you're programmed to kind of see her on the pitch and look out for her - especially for my brother playing today,\" Olivia says.\nOlivia says it's \"tricky watching football in general\" for her now - and she says the first women's match she watched following her sister's death was particularly difficult.\n\"You often kind of forget, and you're often looking at blonde ponytails... a lot of them look like her from behind,\" she says.\nBut, despite the difficult memories football might bring, Olivia says it's worth it.\n\"Things like this, it's really important that we do it because it spreads awareness,\" she says.\n\"And it reminds everybody of Maddy, and it keeps her legacy alive.\n\"It's very emotional, but you just kind of have to put that to one side and think about why you're here and why it's so important.\"\nThe match was in aid of The Maddy Cusack foundation, set up by her family to continue her legacy \"by supporting and making a difference within the world of women's football\".\nThere has been no official explanation of how Maddy died, but her family have spoken out about the pressures faced by female players .\nIn January the Football Association (FA) announced its own investigation, which follows an external investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing at Sheffield United.\nHer family is waiting for an inquest - a court hearing to establish the circumstances surrounding her death - to resume.\nOne of the players who isn't a regular was Maddy's brother, Richard, who also found the day difficult.\n\"It's been very hard actually, today, to see so many people from our childhood and faces you associate with happy times, but ultimately we're here because she's no longer here with us,\" he says.\n\"Which is sad, isn't it? So yeah, it's kind of almost conflicted.\n\"It's a happy day today. Lots of smiles on faces - everyone's enjoying themselves. But ultimately for me, the reason why we're here is tragic, isn't it?\"\nHe says other players \"jumped at the chance\" to be involved.\n\"They've been brilliant and the support that we've had... there was no question of whether they wanted to do it or not,\" he says.\n\"Maddy was such an inspiration within Ilkeston.\"\nHarry Cooke was another player who decided to take part.\nHe played on the same West Hallam juniors team until Maddy had to leave due to FA rules at the time preventing girls and boys from playing together.\n\"It was quite uncommon for a boys team like us to have to have girls playing for us.\n\"So you'd turn up, and the other lads would see a girl on our team and it was a bit of a shock.\n\"And she always shocked them and everyone else who was watching with with how good she was.\"\nSimilar to Richard, Harry also described the day as being filled with conflicting emotions.\n\"It's amazing to see everyone come together,\" he says.\n\"Obviously, it's bittersweet because this is the reason we're all coming back together.\n\"Maddy would have loved to be here today.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here .",
    "A court has ordered the prominent Indian opposition politician and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal be remanded in custody following his arrest over corruption allegations.\nMr Kejriwal, leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), was detained on Thursday by India's financial crimes agency.\nHe has denied any wrongdoing and opposition leaders say his arrest is politically motivated.\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has denied the allegation.\nThe party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi says the authorities are acting against corruption.\nMr Kejriwal was produced in a Delhi trial court on Friday and remanded in custody until 28 March.\nAfter he was detained, his lawyer Shadan Farasat told news agency AFP: \"We are considering our next course of action.\"\nMeanwhile, dozens of AAP leaders have been detained in the capital and sporadic protests erupted elsewhere across India against Mr Kejriwal's arrest, weeks before general elections.\nAAP leaders have said that they will continue their protests and will hold one outside the prime minister's residence.\n\"Kejriwal has been arrested to stop him from campaigning in the general elections,\" said AAP leader and Delhi finance minister Atishi, who uses only one name.\n\"This is a way to steal elections,\" she added in a statement.\nMr Kejriwal's arrest by a financial crimes agency comes as a blow to the opposition just weeks before India's general elections. AAP is part of the 27-party INDIA alliance aiming to challenge the BJP.\nAlluding to Mr Modi, Rahul Gandhi of the main opposition Congress party wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"A scared dictator wants to create a dead democracy.\"\n\"The arrest of elected chief ministers has become a common thing,\" Mr Gandhi wrote.\nSharad Pawar, leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar), said that Mr Kejriwal's arrest showcases the \"depth to which BJP will stoop for power\".\nSamajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said Mr Kejriwal's arrest would \"give birth to a new people's revolution\".\n\"BJP knows that it will not come to power again, due to this fear, it wants to remove the opposition leaders from the public by any means at the time of elections, arrest is just an excuse,\" he posted on X.\nPinarayi Vijayan, the chief minister of Kerala, said Mr Kejriwal's arrest is \"outright vicious and part of a callous plot to silence all opposition voices just ahead of the general elections\".\nHis counterpart in Tamil Nadu, MK Stalin, said: \"Not a single BJP leader faces scrutiny or arrest, laying bare their abuse of power and the decay of democracy.\"\n\"The relentless persecution of opposition leaders by the BJP government smacks of a desperate witch-hunt. This tyranny ignites public fury, unmasking BJP's true colours,\" Mr Stalin said.\nIn the past year or so, several opposition leaders have been imprisoned, questioned or had cases filed against them by federal agencies.\nK Kavitha, leader of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), was arrested in the same case as Mr Kejriwal just days ago. She denies the allegations.\nIn January, Hemant Soren, former Jharkhand chief minister and leader of the opposition Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), was arrested by a federal tax agency on charges of money laundering and land-grabbing. Mr Soren denies the allegations.\nMr Gandhi himself was convicted of criminal libel last year after a complaint by a member of the BJP.\nHis two-year prison sentence saw him disqualified from parliament for a time until the verdict was suspended by a higher court in August last year.\nOn Thursday, the Congress party accused Mr Modi's government of using the tax department to starve them of finances ahead of elections.\nMr Kejriwal is the third AAP leader to be arrested over the alleged corruption case related to a now-scrapped liquor policy in Delhi.\nThe Enforcement Directorate also arrested Mr Kejriwal's deputy, Manish Sisodia, and AAP lawmaker Sanjay Singh in the same case last year.\nSince coming to power in Delhi in 2013, AAP secured significant victories in Punjab's state elections in 2022 and gained a few seats in Mr Modi's home state of Gujarat in the same year.\nRead more India stories from the BBC:",

    "A new mum was confused for another patient and mistakenly fitted with a contraceptive coil after a C-section.\nAnother patient in north Wales almost had the wrong toe removed during surgery to amputate two others.\nA third incident happened when a patient, unable to swallow oral medication, had it crushed, mixed with water and administered with a syringe.\nThese so-called \"never events\" happened at hospitals in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in February.\nWhile details of hospitals and patients involved have not been released, these incidents will be discussed at a health board meeting later.\nNHS Wales describes a never event as a \"serious, largely preventable patient safety incident\" that should not have occurred if preventative measures had been implemented.\nIn the latest available annual figures, there were 37 never events at hospitals in Wales between April 2021 and March 2022.\nBetsi Cadwaldr health board, which covers all of north Wales, accounted for 12 of the 37 never events, while 10 happened in Aneurin Bevan health board's hospitals in south-east Wales.\nThere were none in the Powys or Hywel Dda health board areas in mid and west Wales.\nIn a report into the three incidents in February, Betsi Cadwaladr health board outlined how a patient had a coil - an intrauterine device which prevents pregnancy - inserted after undergoing a Caesarean section.\nDescribed in the report as \"wrong procedure\", it had been planned for a different patient but a mistake had been made after the \"list order was changed due to the increase in category for this patient\".\nAnother incident, described in the report as \"wrong site surgery\", described a patient who was due to have their second and third toes amputated.\nHowever, an incision was made in their fourth toe by accident.\nLuckily, the error was spotted and the correct toes were amputated.In the third never event, described as \"wrong route\", the report details the case of a patient who was unable to swallow oral medication.\nTo administer it, a member of staff crushed it, mixed it with water and \"inadvertently\" gave it intravenously, according to the report.\nThe Welsh government's deputy chief medical officer, Chris Jones, said never events may highlight \"potential weaknesses\" in how an organisation manages fundamental safety processes.\nHe said it was important they were identified and investigated fully.\nThe three never events that happened will be discussed at a Betsi Cadwaladr health board meeting at Venue Cymru, Llandudno, Conwy, on Thursday.\nThe health board has been approached for comment.",
    "More than 27,000 healthcare workers in England are set to receive one-off payments of at least \u00c2\u00a31,600 in their April pay packets.\nThe money will go to staff such as community nurses, physiotherapists and cleaners who do NHS work, but are employed by non-NHS organisations.\nIt follows a campaign for these workers to get the same pay award already made to NHS staff last year in England.\nThat was a lump sum of at least \u00c2\u00a31,655 and a 5% pay rise.\nHealth Secretary Victoria Atkins said the move would ensure \"hardworking staff\" and the organisations they work for can fully benefit from the NHS pay deal.\n\"I hugely value the hard work of all our healthcare staff, and those working in non-NHS organisations offer vital support to patients.\n\"I want to ensure that eligible staff receive these payments, which is why we chose to deliver this funding and why we have taken the decision to relax the financial eligibility criteria employers must meet,\" she said.\nBut one employers' group said the process was unfair, and some would still not get the money.\nWhat's happening?\nThe pay award to NHS staff was made last May . But staff working in frontline NHS settings who are employed by other organisations did not get the one-off payment, even though they are on similar contracts to their NHS counterparts under a system agreed with unions, known as Agenda For Change. These include not-for-profit community groups known as social enterprises, founded to take on outsourced services.\nIn November 2023, the Government said it would pay out the money but employers, who had previously threatened legal action, were told to apply and demonstrate that they could not afford to make the payments from their own resources.\nIn February 2024, an employers' organisation - Social Enterprise UK - told BBC News it was concerned about delays.\nSome organisations with staff on Agenda for Change contracts have now been told the funding will be transferred in time for April pay packets.\nOne of them, CSH Surrey, which provides community nursing and therapy services to adults and children, welcomed the announcement. Steve Flanagan, its chief executive, said: \"We have all fought hard for this and I really appreciate the support from partners across the NHS with this campaign\".\nPhysiotherapist Julie Tollit told BBC News in October she felt \"completely demoralised\" when she was told she would not receive the payment.\nFollowing the latest announcement, she said: \"As a healthcare worker at a social enterprise who provides vital NHS community services, receiving this payment recognises how I am - and have always been - part of the NHS family.\"\nBut employers whose staff do NHS work but not on Agenda for Change contracts will not get the government funding. Dan Gregory, director of Social Enterprise UK, said: \"While we're relieved to see some of our members receive this long-awaited funding, the process itself is fundamentally unfair, failing to recognise their crucial role in delivering frontline care. Some social enterprises have not received funding, while many did.\"\nOther health staff who didn't get the lump sum payment include some \"bank staff\" who provide temporary cover for hospital trusts to fill rota gaps. The Royal College of Nursing has also been campaigning on behalf of members in GP practices.\nAnd some members of the Unite union have staged industrial action when employers have failed to make the payments. These include cleaners, porters and other NHS facilities staff.\nSeparate pay deals have been agreed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
    "Almost four million smart meters in Great Britain were not working at the end of 2023, according to government data.\nFaulty meters can mean customers rely on estimated bills, with some paying too much and struggling to get their money back.\nWhat is a smart meter?\nSmart meters measure how much gas and electricity you use. You get one meter for each energy supply.\nThey can record half-hourly price and consumption data and automatically send readings to your energy supplier at least once a month.\nAccording to the Energy Saving Trust, this means you will be billed accurately for the energy you've used.\nSmart meters usually come with an in-home display, which can help you track how much energy you're using.\nHow do smart meters work?\nSmart meters don't use your wifi.\nInstead, they include a communications hub which connects the smart meter to the in-home display as well as a secure national smart meter network.\nThis lets smart meters talk to different energy suppliers, says Ofgem.\nSome earlier smart meters use the 3G network instead.\nIn-home displays, which update every 30 minutes for gas and in near real-time for electricity , don't affect the readings supplied to your energy company .\nAre smart meters accurate?\nAll smart meters have to be officially approved and their accuracy is monitored , the UK government says.\nSmart Energy GB, a government-backed non-profit organisation supporting the use of smart meter technology, says they are as accurate as traditional meters .\nHow many smart meters are broken?\nAccording to government figures, there were almost 35 million smart meters in homes and businesses across Great Britain at the end of 2023.\nAlmost four million of those were not working properly , according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.\nThis means they were not operating in \"smart mode\" and sending readings to suppliers.\nHowever, Martin Lewis, from MoneySavingExpert, told the BBC Radio 4 PM programme that meters with other problems - such as those sending the wrong readings, or a fault with the in-home display - should also be included in the government statistics.\nThis would mean that about one in five smart meters don't work, he said.\nEnergy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, says suppliers must replace faulty meters.\nHow do I know if my smart meter is broken?\nUnusual bills, sometimes caused by connectivity issues, and a blank screen on the meter can be signs it is not working correctly.\nYour bill will also contain information that could help you find out.\nAccording to Which?, readings on your bill should be marked \"smart\" .\nIf they are marked with an \"e\", they're estimated readings, says Citizens Advice.\nYou can also use its smart checker tool to see if there is a problem between the meter and the central network.\nWhat can I do if my smart meter is broken or my bill is wrong?\nYou should contact your supplier - it should help you fix your meter.\nIf they fail to do so within eight weeks, Ofgem has a guide on how to complain to the Energy Ombudsman. It advises taking manual meter readings in the meantime.\nCustomers who are concerned about paying their bill should also talk to their energy provider. Suppliers are required to offer tailored repayment plans and, where appropriate, payment holidays, Ofgem said.\nYou can also request an independent test of your meter , says Smart Energy GB.\nAlthough it is free, you may have to pay your supplier for organising it if your meter is found to be working correctly.\nThe government says this was the case for the vast majority of meters tested in 2021.\nDo I have to have a smart meter?\nConventional energy meters need to be replaced every 10 to 20 years and most suppliers no longer install non-smart versions.\nHowever, it is not compulsory to have a smart meter unless your current meter is faulty or at the end of its working life, says Ofgem.\nYou can therefore choose not to accept an offer to have one fitted.\nHowever, if you refuse, you might find it hard to access all tariffs , according to Citizens Advice.\nIn general, suppliers must install a smart meter if they are replacing a meter or installing a meter for the first time , such as in a new property, says Ofgem.",

    "A murderer who killed his victim by stabbing him in the neck with a fishing knife has been jailed.\nJames Smith, 36, of Nelson Road, Llanelli, murdered Ashley Sarsero , 26, in Llanelli in September.\nAt Swansea Crown Court, Smith was handed a life sentence and told he would serve a minimum of 28 years in jail before being eligible for parole.\nSteven Morgan, also 36, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years for helping Smith flee the scene.\nThe jury in the three-week trial heard Smith and Morgan had been invited into Mr Sarsero's home in the Maestir area of Felinfoel by his mother, Claire Richards.\nShe had met both men earlier that night outside a local garage and they had accompanied her back to her property because she was \"alone and drunk\".\nWhile all three were at the address, Mr Sarsero returned from attending a gig in Swansea and a heated argument ensued which spilled out into the front garden.\nIt resulted in Smith taking a lock knife from his \"bum bag\" and stabbing Mr Sarsero in the neck \"up to the hilt\", a move he claimed had been in self-defence.\nHe then proceeded to taunt his victim, saying \"cry to your mammy\" before running away, having been prompted to do so by Morgan who was later arrested at the scene.\nSmith, who admitted to having cocaine and various other drugs in his system at the time, turned himself in to the police the following day.\nPrior to doing so he attempted to cover his tracks by washing and disposing of clothing and items that might link him to the incident.\nSpeaking to the court via video link, Mr Sarsero's mother Claire Richards said her \"life is no longer the same without her precious, stunning son in it\".\n\"I was the first to look into his eyes when he was born and the last to do so when he died,\" she added.\nMs Richards said she had been \"broken in two\" by the loss of her son and admitted to having since spent \"days and nights at his graveside\" in \"sheer agony\".\nShe also condemned Smith for showing no remorse or accepting any responsibility for what he had done.\nAppearing in court, Mr Sarsero's partner Jade Jones said her \"world had been changed forever\" by his death and that she had been left suffering nightmares and panic attacks as a result.\n\"Ashley will always be the love of my life,\" she added.\nThe court also heard that, at the time of Mr Sarsero's murder, Smith had been on bail for brandishing a knife in a Llanelli pub in June 2022.\nHe had also claimed to have been in possession of a gun and bullets and had threatened to \"slit someone's throat\".\nSentencing Smith, Judge Daniel Williams said he had to take this separate incident into consideration.\nHe also said Smith had dozens of other previous offences which ranged from theft and assault to attempted robbery with a machete.\nCalling it a \"tragedy beyond words\" that Smith and Ms Richards' paths had crossed that night, he said the person she had mistaken for a \"good Samaritan\" was actually \"a violent coward with a knife and a short temper\".\nSentencing Smith, Judge Williams said unless his release was ordered by the parole board, he would see out the rest of his days in prison.\nJudge Williams told Morgan that instead of aiding Smith's escape, he should have concentrated on helping Mr Sarsero as he lay injured.\nHe added that half of Morgan's time would be served in custody and the rest on licence in the community.",

    "Four years ago, the nation went into lockdown and rallied to support health workers during their darkest hours of the pandemic.\nLaunched that same day in March 2020, the NHS Charities Together Urgent Covid-19 Appeal went on to raise more than \u00c2\u00a3162m, with thousands of people getting behind the campaign to help those on the frontline\nSix-year-old Frank Mills, who has spina bifida, raised more than \u00c2\u00a3100,000 by walking 10m (33ft) , and there were countless bake sales, sponsored runs, sky-dives, along with celebrity-backed exhibitions , books and music releases.\nThe camaraderie was most famously displayed in the determined efforts of the late Captain Sir Tom Moore , who walked 100 laps of his garden in Bedfordshire.\nA more recent investigation by the Charity Commission into the Captain Tom Foundation and a planning row have threatened to tarnish his legacy, so it is perhaps easy to forget that his inspiring campaign contributed \u00c2\u00a339m.\nAlmost one million NHS workers and thousands of patients and community projects have benefited from the appeal, with health-related causes in the East of England receiving \u00c2\u00a310.3m. One of the beneficiaries described the money as a \"lifeline\".\nWhere was the money spent and how has it made a difference?\n'Huge privilege'\nIt can be any time of day when community first responders Chris Lye, Lisa Kenyon and Paul Cherry get the call to action.\nThey are part of a small army of volunteers who are trained to attend emergency calls in conjunction with the East of England Ambulance Service.\nThe roving service spans across Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire and has been a lifeline for countless people.\nChris said he got involved because a mobile service could be the difference between life and death in the rural community he lives in.\n\"I get quite emotional about it,\" he says. \"It feels like such a huge privilege to be in a situation where someone is having a horrendous day and you're there to support them.\n\"You need to be very versatile in how you approach certain situations. I have gone and interacted with many different people who, in normal life, I wouldn't have and that has been very eye-opening.\"\nThe East of England Ambulance Charity, which supports the trust, was granted \u00c2\u00a3508,000 to keep its responder cars on the road.\nIn 2023 alone, the six vehicles saw just under 3,500 patients, with one car used every 150 minutes on average.\n\"There are times the trust is under exceptional pressure,\" says fellow volunteer Paul.\n\"The charity funding allows this car to get out there, it facilitates new people to go out with experienced people and get trained.\"\nLisa says sometimes a bit of comfort - as well as medical help - is just the tonic needed for patients when the ambulance crew arrives.\n\"We can then stop and help the family or make a cup of tea; take them to one side, tend to them, reassure them,\" she says.\n\"We can ask the neighbour to lock up for them - all the things the crew don't tend to have the time for.\"\n'Complete lifeline'\nYou cannot put a price on life. But, for the Pit Stop project, the \u00c2\u00a351,000 it received has certainly saved a few.\nThe scheme, supported by the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital Charity and run by charity MensCraft, helps men who are having suicidal thoughts in Norfolk and Lowestoft, in Suffolk.\nThe cash injection came as part of a wider \u00c2\u00a3445,000 given to the hospital charity from the urgent Covid appeal.\nNick Buck, a MensCraft co-ordinator, says the investment is a \"complete lifeline\" for both the charity and those it serves.\n\"I come from a generation where we don't talk about our feelings - we might get a pat on the back if we've done something well but that was about it,\" he says.\n\"It has almost brought a feeling that as a man you can't talk about it, you have to prove yourself.\"\nThe group, which regularly attracts almost 30 men, provides a safe space for them to have informal one-to-ones about how they are feeling without the need for a referral.\nNick, who got involved in January 2022 and has since taken on a full-time job with MensCraft, says activities such as walks, baking and fishing are also provided to take people out of the \"pressure cooker\" of talking about life.\n\"Without that funding for the year we would have had to look for alternative sources,\" he explains.\n'Above and beyond'\nWhile health workers are buzzing around the hospitals they work in, one person is urging them to slow down for a moment.\nHannah Canning was hired by the North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust to ensure those looking after the patients were also taking care of themselves.\nHer role was funded thanks to \u00c2\u00a3154,000 awarded to the trust's charity to secure a health and wellbeing co-ordinator.\n\"The bottom line is it makes staff feel valued,\" Hannah says. \"Through Covid they gave their time and their safety.\"\nSchemes run as part of her role have seen money made available for items to brighten up the workplace as well as time set aside to encourage staff to",
    "France's prime minister says a teenage girl will be sued by the state for falsely accusing her headteacher of striking her in a heated exchange over her wearing an Islamic head-covering.\nThe headteacher insisted that the pupil remove her head-covering inside the school, in accordance with French law.\nHe resigned after death threats circulated on social media.\nThe Islamist threat to French schools is taken extremely seriously since the murder of two teachers.\nSamuel Paty was decapitated on the street in a Paris suburb in 2020 and Dominique Bernard was killed at his school in Arras five months ago.\nThe Paris school headteacher, whose name has not been made public, announced his decision in an email sent on Friday to colleagues at the Maurice Ravel Lyc\u00c3\u00a9e in the 20th district of Paris.\n\"I have finally taken the decision to quit my functions,\" he explained, \"out of concern for my own safety and that of the establishment.\"\n\"I leave after seven years, rich and intense, spent at your side, and after 45 years in public education,\" he wrote, thanking his colleagues for the support they had shown him over the past three weeks.\nIn the incident, which took place on 28 February, the head told three female pupils they should obey the law by removing their head coverings.\nTwo complied, but the third did not and there was an altercation.\nIn the days that followed, the head was the object of death threats on social media, which were signalled by the school to an interior ministry hotline.\nProsecutors said two people had been detained in connection with the death threats. Their identities have not been revealed, but the education ministry said they had no link with the school.\nPolice were sent to patrol around the school, which also received a visit from Education Minister Nicole Belloubet.\nOfficers found no evidence that the headteacher had struck the girl, and now Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has stepped in to say she is to be taken to court for making false allegations.\n\"The state... will always stand with these officials, those who are on the frontline faced with these breaches of secularism, these attempts of Islamist entryism in our education establishments,\" he said.\nPoliticians from both left and right expressed outrage that the career of a respected teacher should be ended by a hate campaign on the Internet.\n\"This government is incapable of protecting our schools,\" said Marine Le Pen of the hard-right National Rally on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\"It is defeat for the state\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and the gangrene of Islamism gains yet more ground,\" said her niece Marion Mar\u00c3\u00a9chal of the rival hard-right party Reconquest.\n\"This is where you end up when your policy is 'don't make waves'. This is where all those little surrenders lead to,\" said Bruno Retailleau of the centre-right Republicans.\n\"It's unacceptable. When a headteacher steps down because of death threats, it is a collective failure,\" said Boris Vallaud of the Socialist Party.\nIn a separate development, several Paris schools were forced to close on Wednesday after they received bomb threats from apparent Islamists.\nLast week around 30 other schools in the Paris area received similar threats, accompanied by a video of a beheading.\nWhile investigators are obliged to take the threats seriously, they cannot rule out that they are part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\nPrime Minister Attal warned earlier this month that the Kremlin had embarked on a \"massive destabilisation enterprise\" to undermine French support for Ukraine.",
    "The UK's approach to China is \"more robust\" than most of its allies, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said.\nIt comes after some MPs criticised the response to cyber-attacks against the Electoral Commission and UK politicians, which the government has blamed on Beijing-linked hackers .\nMinisters are facing growing calls to designate China as a \"threat\".\nHowever, Downing Street has played down suggestions the government is preparing to do this.\nAppearing in front of senior MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Sunak defended the government's approach.\nHe rejected a suggestion from Business and Trade Committee chairman, Labour MP Liam Byrne, that where allies acted on China, the UK was merely \"thinking about it\".\nMr Byrne highlighted how the US House of Representatives had passed a bill requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance to sell its controlling stake in the social media app or see it banned in America .\nHowever, the prime minister pointed to examples including European countries not removing Huawei equipment from their telecommunications networks and not placing similar restrictions on exports of sensitive technology to China.\nHe added: \"I am entirely confident that our approach to dealing with the risk that China poses is very much in line with our allies and in most cases goes further in protecting ourselves.\"\nHe added: \"China represents the greatest state-based threat to our economic security.\"\nThe government currently describes China as an \"epoch-defining challenge\" but some MPs, including former cabinet ministers Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Suella Braverman,  want it to go further and formally label the country a \"threat\".\nOn Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden suggested this could happen.\nHe told the Commons \"we are currently in the process of collective government agreement\" over the issue and the country's alleged involvement in the cyber-attacks \"will have a very strong bearing on the decision that we make\".\nHowever, asked on Tuesday whether ministers were planning to designate China a threat, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"There isn't a mechanism under UK law or indeed in our G7 or Five Eyes countries [an intelligence alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States] that has a designation process like that.\"\nHe added: \"The integrated review has already set out the UK's position in relation to China being a state-based threat to our economic security. And it set out a clear strategy to deal with the challenge that China presents.\"\nIn response to calls to put China in the \"enhanced\" tier under the foreign influence registration scheme, he said the scheme was \"in the process of being finalised and no countries have been specified yet.\"\nSpecifying a country in the \"enhanced tier\" gives the power to require registration of activities of foreign government-controlled entities in the UK.\nOn Monday, the government announced sanctions on two Chinese nationals, as well as the China state-affiliated cyber espionage group Advanced Persistent Threat Group 31, over cyber-attacks on the Electoral Commission and 43 individuals including MPs and peers.\nThe cyber-attack on the Electoral Commission between August 2021 and October 2022 was one of the most significant in British history.\nOn Tuesday the charge d'affairs of the Chinese embassy was summoned to the Foreign Office over the cyber-attacks.\nSome of the MPs targeted have criticised the government's response, with Sir Iain describing it as \"like an elephant giving birth to a mouse\".\nAnother Conservative MP Tim Loughton described it as like turning up \"at a gun fight with a wooden spoon\".\nThe sanctions were part of coordinated action alongside the UK's allies, with the United States charging seven alleged Chinese hackers on Monday .\nChina has rejected allegations of state involvement in the hacks.\nBeijing's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian accused the UK and US of \"politicising cyber security issues\" and \"smearing China\".",

    "Parents say some children are facing long journeys because a city's secondary schools are full.\nOne parent said his son, who expected to go to Chesterton in Cambridge, has been placed 13 miles away in St Ives.\nA new school planned for north-west Cambridge could be delayed further because of planning appeals by the Environment Agency.\nThe trust that runs Chesterton said its planning had been based on the new school opening.\nCambridge is expanding and while primary school places have mostly kept pace with housing growth, the same has not been true of secondary schools.\nWhen children received their secondary school offers on 1 March Cambridgeshire County Council documents showed that every secondary in Cambridge was full, with many taking on additional students.\nAcross the whole of Cambridgeshire, only five schools were listed as having spaces left for Year 7 pupils.\nThe situation for children living within the catchment area of Chesterton Community College is particularly difficult. Last year the school took 56 additional children above its published admission number (PAN) of 180 for its current Year 7 cohort.\nEmily's daughter Genevieve is in the final year of primary school and they live half a mile from Chesterton Community College, well within its catchment.\nHowever, despite putting the school down as their first choice for next year, and putting other nearby schools as their second and third choices, they were placed at Coleridge Community College on the other side of the city.\nThe journey by foot would take about 50 minutes and they said there was not a safe cycle route.\nEmily said her daughter was \"really upset\".\n\"She's by no means the only person in her class who's been affected by this. A lot of children have been sent all over Cambridge, and indeed all over Cambridgeshire.\"\nA significant house-building programme is taking place in north-west Cambridge, including Darwin Green and the development at Eddington , which is primarily for Cambridge University staff and their families.\nA new secondary school is proposed for Darwin Green. It is due to be built in the phase 2 development. However, planning permission for that phase is currently subject to an appeal by the Environment Agency over concerns around water security.\nThe Meridian Trust , which is the sponsor of the new school, said it expected it to open in September 2026. They already run a number of other schools in the region .\nIts chief executive Mark Woods said the trust was \"aware there are a number of challenges with school places in the local area\" and they \"continue to work closely with Cambridgeshire County Council to support them with this where we can\".\nMost schools in Cambridge will be taking on extra pupils this year. However some children feel they are missing out.\nTaxi bill of 'thousands'\nAlexis lives in Eddington and his son Sam attends the local primary school. Despite putting local schools on their choices form he has been allocated a place 13 miles away in St Ives.\nHis dad says the council has told him it will provide a taxi for transport. However he thinks this will cost the authority \"thousands of pounds\" each year.\nOne of his local councillors, Antoinette Nestor, has been trying to support some of the families. She says there are 111 children in Cambridgeshire who have not been given a place at any of their three choices of secondary school.\nShe wrote to the Department for Education (DfE) asking for information about why council money, which the local authority said was intended for 11-16 education at Chesterton Community College, appeared to have been used to fund a new sixth form centre at the school.\nThe council told the BBC this \"effectively took that 11-16 capacity away\" and \"has directly affected the number of children living in catchment who have been allocated a place at Chesterton\".\nHowever the Eastern Learning Alliance , which runs Chesterton, says this is not true.\nIn a statement it said: \"The sixth form was agreed by the DfE to serve young people in the local community at that point and in the future. This decision was predicated on place planning data collated at local authority [county council] level, which included the delivery of Darwin Green secondary school.\n\"This data showed that additional sixth form places were required (and continue to be), and Year 7 places were not.\n\"It continues to be the case that there has been no growth in student numbers in the Year 6 cohorts at our feeder primary schools: all students in our feeder primary schools have been offered a place at Chesterton.\n\"Going forward we know that the planned opening of Darwin Green secondary continues to be the overall solution to the current issues with place planning locally.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Owen Hewitt, is a trainee chartered accountant at accountancy firm haysmacintyre.\nHe's two years into his training with more exams coming up this year.\nWhat's unusual about him and his peers, is that they will be the first generation of accountants to use artificial intelligence (AI) right from the beginning of their careers.\nMr Hewitt is hoping that AI will take over some of the more tedious parts of the job.\n\"These (AI) can remove the burden of the more time-consuming tasks, like analysis of financial data,\" says Mr Hewitt.\nThat leaves the humans to focus on more subjective - and more interesting - decisions, like whether a business is viable, or whether debts are likely to be paid.\n\"Whilst AI can learn from data and make predictions, it can't yet replace the human judgement required to weigh up different variables and make an informed decision,\" he says.\nSo, AI is increasingly being used for routine and time-consuming tasks such as summarising documents, creating content, drafting documentation, advanced searching, analytics and insight and knowledge management - often work done by more junior accountancy staff.\n\"When you look at some of the tasks that auditors were doing - some of the boring, mundane tasks around churning data and manipulating it into a format where you can then actually do something valuable with it - that's where artificial intelligence can play a really big part,\" says Matthew Campbell, audit chief technology officer for KPMG UK.\nGiven that auditing is a relatively low-margin business, there's concern that the more widespread use of AI could lead to a loss of jobs.\nAccording to a KPMG survey , four in 10 senior audit professionals expect that the increased efficiency that AI can bring will lead to a reduction in the size of auditing teams.\nAlready, many manual audit and reporting tasks have been outsourced to other countries, with most major banks in the UK now having taken on large numbers of qualified accountants in India, who perform a significant proportion of month-end financial reporting tasks.\nThis, says Alex King, founder and chartered accountant at finance platform Generation Money, means that junior accountants working in audit will need to focus more on client-facing skills.\n\"Generally, the nature of a junior accountant's role is likely to change more towards systems management - overseeing AI powered software and databases - and relationship management, and away from the traditional reconciliations and ledgers work,\" he says.\nAs a result, training programmes are changing.\n\"We're still recruiting a number of people, graduates, and we're also recruiting a number of apprentices. I think what will change over time is the skillsets of some of those individuals,\" says Mr Campbell.\n\"We're already starting to see that, so we've invested in putting a number of our auditors through a master's degree in applied data science, so they can take that auditing and accounting knowledge with their data science skills knowledge, to really bring the best of those skills together.\"\nThe accountancy industry has seen some high-profile failures in recent years.\nIn March, KPMG was fined \u00c2\u00a31.5m for failings in its 2019 audit of advertising agency M&C Saatchi. And it's not alone in making errors.\nLast summer, a report from the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) found that four in 10 audits conducted by global accounting firms had significant flaws, and that the proportion was rising rapidly.\nMeanwhile, the UK's accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), carried out 19 investigations in the 2022-2023 financial year, slapping fines of \u00c2\u00a340.5 million on auditing firms and their clients for audit failings.\nAs a result, auditing firms are now under great scrutiny; and to tighten up their procedures, many are turning to AI.\n\"As generative AI plays a more prominent role in contributing to first drafts of content, the human auditor role can be elevated to focus on areas of judgment and challenge,\" says Marc Bena, digital audit leader at PwC UK.\n\"The ability to analyse data at a much larger scale also means we can perform better risk assessments and analysis.\"\nAI is particularly good at spotting anomalies in vast amounts of data, making it useful when examining what may amount to billions of transactions by a client.\nKPMG itself uses AI for high-risk transactions to look for such anomalies, such as the posting of unusual amounts, postings made by somebody unusual or postings made at a weekend.\n\"We get to a point where it's a truly data-driven audit, where we identify the risks from within a population of data and use that to help focus our audit efforts on the most complex, the high-risk, the most judgmental areas,\" says Mr Campbell.\nMore technology of business\nAs for more high-level jobs, AI may help here too. Auditing firms have been finding it hard to retain talent, with 90% of auditors telling Caseware last year that it is either somewhat or extremely difficult.\nOver",
    "Two firms could face fines after 13 illegal workers were arrested during an immigration raid.\nTwelve men and a woman were arrested in north Wales on 19 March.\nFP McCann, a concrete supplier based in County Londonderry, has been referred for a penalty of up to \u00c2\u00a3225,000 for employing five illegal contractors.\nAdana Construction, from Stockport, has been referred for a penalty of up to \u00c2\u00a3180,000 for employing four illegal workers.\n\"Illegal working causes untold harm to communities, puts vulnerable people at risk, defrauds the public purse and undercuts honest employers and jobseekers, HM Insp Ryan Moore said.\n\"This operation was a huge success and I thank our officers who executed it expertly\".\nThe Home Office said the operation at the former paper mill where the workers were arrested was launched in response to concerns raised by the public.\nShotton Mill is being converted to a containerboard factory.\nThe 13 people arrested were working as subcontracted labourers and steel-fixers.  The Home Office said they would now be removed from the UK.\nHow the system works\nBoth companies were issued with civil penalty referral notices, pending a review of evidence from the site visit and company records.\nUnder the civil penalty process, a referral notice is issued if officials determine they have found illegal workers and there is no statutory excuse for employing them.\nAt that stage the company can provide further evidence that it wants to be taken into account when determining liability and the level of any penalty.\nThe civil penalty can also be challenged in court. Fines for employing illegal workers were significantly increased in February.\nThe maximum civil penalty for a first breach increased from \u00c2\u00a315,000 a worker to \u00c2\u00a345,000 a worker.\nThis article was amended on 28 March 2024.

    "The Princess of Wales \"will be thrilled\", Queen Camilla has told well-wishers, after she received homemade posters on a trip to Shrewsbury.\nThe Queen thanked two girls at a farmers' market for making signs, telling one: \"I shall send this off to Catherine, she'll be thrilled.\"\nThe princess revealed on Friday she is in the early stages of treatment after a cancer diagnosis.\nShe said it was a \"huge shock\" but said she was \"getting stronger every day\".\nThe Queen stopped to say hello to 10-year-old Harriet Waterson and her sister Lois, aged six, who both handed over posters decorated with stars and hearts.\nHarriet apologised, saying \"I'm sorry they're a bit creased\" but the Queen crouched down to talk to them and said: \"I'll take them carefully and we'll make sure she knows they're coming\".\nThe girls' mother Lucy Waterson, 44, later said: \"We didn't think she would get to see them, to be honest, and she said she would certainly pass on her best wishes.\"\nThe visit to Shrewsbury was the Queen's first royal engagement with members of the public since Catherine revealed her diagnosis.\nDetails of the cancer have not been disclosed, but Kensington Palace said it was confident the princess will make a full recovery.\nCatherine had major abdominal surgery in January, but subsequent tests found cancer had been present, leading to doctors advising a course of preventative chemotherapy.\nThe princess said she and William had been \"doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family\".\nIn a video statement, she added: \"It has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be okay.\"\nKing Charles and the Queen were informed of the news about Catherine's health prior to Friday's announcement.\nA Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was \"so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did\".\nQueen Camilla has carried out a string of royal engagements in recent weeks, increasing her workload while the King has temporarily stepped back from public duties while he is treated for cancer.\nIn Shrewsbury, the Queen toured the farmers' market, stopping at stalls selling wine, sausage rolls and honey, while she was presented with a bottle of Shrewsbury gin.",
    "King Charles III has spoken of his \"great sadness\" at missing the traditional Maundy Thursday service.\nThe King is not attending public events while he has treatment for cancer but recorded a message that was played at the service at Worcester Cathedral.\nQueen Camilla was instead at the service, where she handed out Maundy money.\nThe unique coins are given to older people who have helped the the church and their local community.\nThe number of recipients of Maundy money matches the age of the monarch - so 75 men and 75 women received this symbolic gift this year.\nIn his message, the King reaffirmed his coronation pledge \"not to be served, but to serve\" with \"my whole heart\".\nHe praised those who \"extend the hand of friendship, especially in a time of need\".\nHe added: \"It is for me a great sadness that I cannot be with you today.\"\nAround 200 people braved cold and wet weather to catch a glimpse of the Queen when she arrived at the service, which takes place on the Thursday before Easter Sunday each year .\nAfter the ceremony, Sheila Clark, 66, handed the Queen a bouquet of flowers, a picture of the King and Queen taken at the Scottish Highland Braemar Games, and a card for Catherine, the Princess of Wales.\n\"I just wanted to come and see the Queen,\" said Ms Clark, a retired teacher from Glasgow. \"And let her know that I'm thinking of her.\"\nThe King's message, recorded in mid-March, included a Bible reading and a call that as a nation: \"We need and benefit greatly from those who extend the hand of friendship to us, especially in a time of need.\"\nAlthough not directly commenting on his own health - or the cancer diagnosis of the Princess of Wales - he spoke of the importance of those who care for others.\nThe 150 recipients of Maundy money today \"are wonderful examples of such kindness; of going way beyond the call of duty and of giving so much of their lives to the service of others in their communities,\" he said.\nThe Maundy service, in which the monarch gives out gifts, is one of the oldest royal ceremonies, dating back at least as far as the 13th Century and the reign of King John, a monarch who is buried in this medieval cathedral.\nUntil James II in the 17th Century, the monarch also used to wash the feet of the poor, in an echo of Jesus washing the feet of the apostles at the Last Supper.\nNow the ceremony involves giving purses of coins to older people who have been involved in helping the church and the local community.\nThis year's recipients received \u00c2\u00a35 coins with the image of a Tudor dragon, a 50p marking the The Royal National Lifeboat Institution's 200th anniversary and specially minted silver Maundy coins.\nNorman Tomlinson, 72, from Mansfield, received the unique coins for his work with his local hospice and Catholic church, which includes taking communion to the sick and housebound.\nHe said receiving Maundy money was a \"once in a lifetime\" experience, and that he told the Queen he hopes the King and Princess of Wales will get well soon.\nThis was another engagement in which Queen Camilla has appeared on behalf of the King, while he continues with the cancer treatment that began last month .\nHe has not attended big public events with large crowds, but he will be at the Easter church service on Sunday morning at St George's Chapel in Windsor.\nIt will be a smaller event this Easter, with the Prince and Princess of Wales and their children not attending, as Catherine continues her recovery.\nThe King had sent a video message to the annual Commonwealth service earlier this month, but it is understood that Worcester Cathedral did not have the video facilities, so an audio message was played instead.\nThe anti-monarchy group Republic issued a statement ahead of the service saying the monarchy is \"bad for Britain's democracy\" and the Queen's visit to Worcester will be a sign of \"how out of touch the monarchy is with the values of most of us\".\nProtest chants could be heard as the Queen arrived at Worcester Cathedral.",
    "A man who made false rape claims against six men has been jailed for eight years.\nLiam Smith's lies resulted in his victims being interviewed by police and subjected to \"degrading\" forensic tests, Newcastle Crown Court heard.\nHis victims said the \"compulsive liar\" had ruined their lives, caused trust issues and made several feel suicidal.\nSmith, 27 and from Leeds, had denied seven counts of perverting the course of justice but was found guilty .\n'Made to feel a criminal'\nNorthumbria Police said investigating Smith's false claims, which were made between 2018 and 2020, had cost more than \u00c2\u00a310,000.\nProsecutor Anne Richardson said all the men were either accused of rape or a serious sexual assault and there were \"serious consequences for all of them\".\nShe said the \"stigma\" of such allegations on the men, none of whom can be identified, was \"very grave\".\nOne of the men told the court the accusations had \"ruined\" his life and he feared anybody finding out he had been arrested as there was the feeling there was \"no smoke without fire\".\nHe said: \"I was made to feel like a criminal even though I had done nothing wrong.\"\nThe man said he had been left with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.\n'Agony'\nIn a statement read to the court, another victim said Smith, who was also known as James Smith or James Robertson, was a \"compulsive liar\".\nThe man said he was in \"total shock\" when he was arrested, adding he felt \"disgusted and really hurt\" by the false claim.\n\"This false allegation has turned my world upside down,\" the man said, adding he felt \"betrayed\" and \"damaged\".\nAnother man said he was \"devastated\", with a fourth saying the experience at the police station had been \"very degrading and embarrassing\" and he was still \"not over it\".\nThe victims also spoke of the financial cost and inconvenience of having their phones seized by police for several months.\nIn mitigation, Sam Faulks said Smith, of Armley Ridge Road, had autism spectrum disorder although that did not excuse or explain his actions.\nJudge Penny Moreland said all the victims had spoken of their \"agony\" of having such serious accusations hanging over them as well as \"reputational damage\" even after the allegations were shown to be false.\nShe also said his lies could have a serious impact on genuine victims of rape who may now fear they would not be believed.\nFollow BBC North East  on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram .

    "Israel says Hamas's rejection of a current proposal for a Gaza truce deal with Israel shows the \"damage\" done by the UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel would not surrender to what it called the Palestinian armed group's \"delusional demands\".\nThey include an end to the war and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces.\nThe US called the Israeli statement \"inaccurate in almost every respect\".\nA state department spokesman insisted that Hamas's response had been prepared before the Security Council vote on Monday.\nThe Israeli military meanwhile said it had confirmed that the deputy leader of Hamas's military wing, Marwan Issa, was killed in a strike on a tunnel complex beneath Nuseirat refugee camp about two weeks ago .\n\"We have checked all the intelligence,\" spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said. \"Marwan Issa was eliminated in the strike.\"\nHamas political official Izzat al-Rishq said he had \"no confidence\" in the Israeli claim and that the group's military leadership would have the \"final say\".\nRear Admiral Hagari described Issa as the group's \"number three\" and \"one of the organisers\" of Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, when about 1,200 people were killed and 253 others taken hostage.\nMore than 32,400 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 81 people in the past 24 hours, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael reacted furiously after the UN Security Council adopted for the first time a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the war in Gaza following months of deadlock over the issue.\nFourteen council members, including the UK, voted in favour of the text, which also demanded the unconditional release of all remaining hostages and an urgent expansion of humanitarian aid deliveries.\nThe US - Israel's closest ally and military supporter - criticised the resolution for failing to condemn Hamas for the 7 October attacks.\nBut in a sign of its increasing frustration at the way Israel is conducting the war, the US abstained, saying it fully supported the key objectives.\nIn protest, Israel cancelled a planned visit by an Israeli delegation to Washington to discuss its planned ground offensive in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million people have sought shelter. The US has warned that a full-scale assault could cause a humanitarian catastrophe.\nLater, Hamas put out a statement rejecting the latest truce plan put forward by mediators from the US, Qatar and Egypt at indirect talks in Doha.\nThe group said it was sticking to its original demands for \"a permanent ceasefire that would lead to a full withdrawal\" of Israeli forces from Gaza and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes.\nOn Tuesday morning, the Israeli prime minister's office said Hamas's stance \"clearly demonstrates its utter disinterest in a negotiated deal and attests to the damage done by the UN Security Council's resolution\".\n\"Israel will not address Hamas's delusional demands,\" it added. \"Israel will pursue and achieve its just war objectives: Destroying Hamas's military and governmental capacities, release of all the hostages, and ensuring Gaza will not pose a threat to the people of Israel in the future.\"\nBut US state department spokesman Matthew Miller rejected the criticism.\n\"That statement is inaccurate in almost every respect and it is unfair to the hostages and their families,\" he told reporters in Washington.\n\"The description of Hamas's response that has been aired in the public is all from news reports. It's not the actual substance of the response. I can tell you that response was prepared before the UN Security Council vote, not after it.\"\nQatar's foreign ministry spokesman, Majed al-Ansari, told a news conference in Doha that the indirect talks \"are ongoing, they have not stopped\".\n\"There is no timetable for negotiations, but we are continuing with our partners in mediation efforts,\" he said, adding that they were currently taking place \"at the level of technical teams\".\nHowever, Israeli media and Reuters news agency cited Israeli officials as saying that Israel had recalled its negotiating team from Qatar after 10 days of talks.\nHamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said during a visit to Iran - which arms and funds the group - that the resolution showed Israel was experiencing \"unprecedented political isolation\".\nDuring a week-long ceasefire in late November, 105 hostages were freed in return for some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.\nThe latest deal rejected by Hamas reportedly proposed a six-week pause in the fighting and the release of 40 of the hostages still being held by Hamas in exchange for as many as 800 Palestinian prisoners.\nThere was no indication of a let-up in the war on the ground in Gaza, with the latest Israeli air strikes reportedly killing dozens of Palestinians.\nPalestinian media and local health officials said at least 18 people, including nine",
    "A Russian-backed \"propaganda\" network has been broken up for spreading anti-Ukraine stories and paying unnamed European politicians, according to authorities in several countries.\nInvestigators claimed it used the popular Voice of Europe website as a vehicle to pay politicians.\nThe Czech Republic and Poland said the network aimed to influence European politics.\nVoice of Europe did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nCzech media, citing intelligence sources, reported that politicians from Germany, France, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Hungary were paid by Voice of Europe in order to influence upcoming elections for the European Parliament.\nThe German newspaper Der Spiegel said the money was either handed over in cash in covert meetings in Prague or through cryptocurrency exchanges.\nPro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk is alleged by the Czech Republic to be behind the network.\nMr Medvedchuk was arrested in Ukraine soon after the Russian invasion, but later transferred to Russia with about 50 prisoners of war in exchange for 215 Ukrainians.\nCzech authorities also named Artyom Marchevsky, alleging he managed the day-to-day business of the website. Both men were sanctioned by Czech authorities.\nPoland's intelligence agency said it had conducted searches in the Warsaw and Tychy regions and seized \u00e2\u0082\u00ac48,500 (\u00c2\u00a341,500) and $36,000 (\u00c2\u00a328,500).\n\"Money from Moscow has been used to pay some political actors who spread Russian propaganda,\" BIS said in a statement.\nIt added that the sums amounted to \"millions\" of Czech crowns (tens of thousands of pounds).\nThe alleged propaganda network \"aimed to carry out activities against the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,\" BIS said.\nBIS did not name the politicians allegedly involved. However, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo alleged they included members of the European Parliament.\n\"It came for example to light that Russia has approached MEPs, but also paid [them], to promote Russian propaganda here,\" Mr De Croo told Belgian MPs.\nThe Voice of Europe website was offline on Thursday. An archived version of its homepage showed several articles highlighting internal divisions within European countries and expressing scepticism about support for Ukraine.\nThese included: \"Protest in Prague: people's voice against corruption, military support for Ukraine, and government\", and \"Ukraine's army faces a mounting troop shortage amid ongoing challenges\".\nVoice of Europe had more than 180,000 followers on Twitter/X. The publication did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
    "When a massive cargo ship sent Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge crashing into the water, it created both a human and economic disaster.\nTwo bodies have been recovered and four other construction workers are missing, presumed dead.\nBut the bridge's collapse has also cut off a main artery handling billions of dollars of goods to and from a key port. The Port of Baltimore is the 14th largest in the US.\nBoat traffic is at a standstill and the wreckage of the bridge still lies across the Patapsco River. Officials warn that the closure could create massive ripple effects in the global supply chain.\nIn 2023, 52.3 million tonnes of foreign cargo, worth $80.8bn (\u00c2\u00a364bn), passed through Baltimore, according to data from the state of Maryland, which makes it much smaller than neighbouring New York but a key port for certain goods.\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg described it as the country's largest vehicle handling port, important not only for car imports and exports but also farm equipment.\nAbout a dozen ships are currently trapped in the port, Vice Admiral Peter Gautier told reporters, adding that the foreign-flagged vessels are \"dry bulk carriers, car carriers and a number of maritime administration ships\".\nUnder ordinary circumstances, an enormous variety of goods like automobiles, soybeans, pharmaceuticals, metals, textiles, animal feed, and even newsprint pass in and out of the port. It's also critical for maritime travel; 444,000 passengers cruised through Baltimore in 2023, according to state data.\nAutomobiles are the facility's signature product. Nearly 850,000 cars and light trucks flowed through the Port of Baltimore in 2023, according to Maryland state data, more than any other US port.\nA majority of those cars come from foreign manufacturers like Mazda, Subaru, and Mercedes-Benz, meaning the closure could have major implications for the companies across the globe. Car manufacturers have already started to divert their products in the wake of the bridge collapse.\nJeremie Papin, Chair of Nissan Americas, told the BBC: \"We have been re-routing our ships to other ports in the east coast, and so we think there will be minimal, if any, impact to our business in the near term.\"\nFossil fuels, particularly coal, are some of the biggest exports that go through the Port of Baltimore. Coal made up a lion's share of these shipments, with over 13.2 million tonnes exported in 2022, according the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Shipments of fuel oils, natural gas, and other fossil fuel products were also imported and exported.\nPlenty of goods used in everyday life were brought into the US through Baltimore in 2022, according to data from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\nOver 106,000 tonnes of furniture, 738,000 tonnes of newsprint, 36,000 tonnes of alcoholic beverages, and 83,000 tonnes of meat and seafood entered the port that year. Imports of plastics and rubber totalled more than 221,000 tonnes in 2022.\n\"Our top priority is to get the shipping lane open because of the impact it has on our country and the global supply chain,\" US Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said at a press conference on Wednesday. \"We are also working on a replacement bridge, so we can have those plans in place to reconstruct the bridge as quickly as possible.\"\nBut the economic toll of the bridge collapse goes beyond just the items that pass in and out.\nThe port of Baltimore generates about 15,000 jobs, according to the Maryland governor's office, and nearly 140,000 jobs in total are linked to the port's activities. About 8,000 jobs have been directly affected by the closure.\n\"The collapse of the Key Bridge is not just a Maryland crisis, the collapse of the Key Bridge is a global crisis,\" Maryland Governor Wes Moore said on Wednesday. \"The national economy and the world's economy depends on the Port of Baltimore.\"",
    "Four people have been killed and more than 40 injured in a motorway crash involving a coach near the east German city of Leipzig, police say.\nThe FlixBus coach veered to the right on the busy A9 autobahn before falling on to its side.\nIt had left Berlin with two drivers and 52 passengers and was on its way to Nuremberg en route to Zurich, the company confirmed.\nOfficials in the state of Saxony said their thoughts were with the victims.\nInitial reports spoke of five deaths but police later confirmed four with a fifth person in a critical condition.\nIn all, six people were seriously injured and 29 received light injuries.\nFlixBus, founded in Munich in 2011, runs a network of long-distance coach services in Europe, America and Asia.\nThe company said the accident happened on Wednesday at about 10:00 (09:00 GMT) on the A9, the north-south motorway from Berlin to Munich. The 107 service bus was two hours into its southbound journey at the time of the crash at a junction near Leipzig/Halle Airport, to the north-west of the city.\nPolice told German media that no other vehicle had been involved in the incident.\n\"The exact circumstances of the accident are not yet known,\" the company said in a statement, adding that the long-distance service was being run on behalf of FlixBus. \"Our thoughts are with all those affected by this accident and their families.\"\nPolice said rescue helicopters and a large number of ambulances had been immediately called to the scene.\nLocal hospitals were told to prepare for a major emergency. Both carriageways on the autobahn were closed near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz interchange.\nCoaches have crashed in the past on the A9 motorway near Leipzig, most recently in December. A woman was killed in a coach accident on the A9 in 2019, some 20km (12 miles) south of Wednesday's crash in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.",
    "A town will get a fleet of 55 new electric buses after funding of more than \u00c2\u00a330m was pledged.\nCommuters should be able to hop on the greener vehicles in Basildon, Essex, by 2025.\nPart of the cost was covered with \u00c2\u00a34.8m from the second wave of the government's Zero Emission Bus Regional Areas funding - known as Zebra 2.\nThe additional \u00c2\u00a325.8m was put up by First Bus, in a bid to help it achieve a zero-emission bus fleet by 2035.\nA First Bus spokesperson said its funding would be put towards upgrading the infrastructure at a depot to accommodate the electric vehicles.\nThe buses were expected to be put in place in late 2025 and have routes between the town and neighbouring areas such as Chelmsford, Lakeside and Southend.\nPiers Marlow, managing director of First Bus East of England, said: \"We are absolutely delighted with today's announcement that we have secured zero-emission bus funding from the Department for Transport.\n\"We have worked in close partnership with Essex County Council on this bid, and we are excited about getting these vehicles onto the road.\"\nKevin Blake, Conservative and cabinet member at Basildon District Council for the environment, carbon reduction and waste enforcement, said: \"We have ambitious plans to reach carbon net zero in the borough and I am delighted to hear of the introduction of these electric buses.\n\"I would also like to thank First Buses for their significant investment into the transport infrastructure.\"\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said Basildon has become one of a number of areas in England to receive a major funding boost to help introduce electric buses.\nThe scheme has also been introduced in other parts of the East of England.\nMore than \u00c2\u00a337m has been spent on converting 60% of the vehicles operated by First Bus in Norwich.\nIts depot has become home to the first fully-electric bus fleet outside of London, the company said.\nPassengers praised a reduction in fumes and a smoother ride.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "A couple has spent thousands of pounds opening a retro gaming arcade at a Norfolk seafront resort.\nDean Gray and Sophi Parkes opened the attraction at the Merrivale Model Village in Great Yarmouth this week.\nThey purchased a job lot of games from a business in Bristol that closed down and Mr Gray said it was a throwback to his childhood in the early 1990s.\nGaming podcaster Chris Berrow, from Essex, also said a \"retro revival\" was attracting people back to arcades.\nMr Gray said the 30 arcade machines he purchased ranged in price from \u00c2\u00a31,000 to \u00c2\u00a35,000 and featured classic games such as Pacman and Mortal Kombat.\n\"It takes me back to the early '90s when I was a little boy and I used to play them in my dad's arcade,\" said Mr Gray, 34.\nHis business partner, Ms Parkes, 45, added: \"I definitely feel old playing these again but I think the kids [of today] will enjoy it.\"\n'Retro revival'\nMr Berrow, who co-hosts the Naked Gaming podcast, said the Covid-19 lockdowns attracted more people to the world of gaming.\nHe said some players found playing solo to be \"a lonely experience\" and there was a desire to play alongside other people.\n\"If you're under the age of 35, you probably haven't been to a classic arcade where you took your coins and put them in the machine and had that experience,\" said Mr Berrow.\n\"If you love playing modern games and you like playing some of these remasters, you might actually want to go to an arcade just to find out what all the fuss is about.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Plans for a new city link road are in doubt due to a change of rules to protect endangered Barbastelle bats.\nThe 3.9 miles (6.3km) Norwich Western link - costing \u00c2\u00a3274m - would connect the Broadland Northway at the A1067 with the A47 at Easton.\nNatural England has placed \"favourable conservation status\" on the species, effective from this month.\nNorfolk County Council said the changes would make it \"almost impossible\" for the road to be granted a licence.\nConservative council leader, Kay Mason Billig, made the surprise announcement at a full council meeting on Tuesday.\nShe said: \"Unfortunately [Natural England] have now revised its guidance which means the bar that we will have to leap over will be almost impossible to achieve.\n\"I'm very disappointed, we want to deliver this road for the people of Norfolk, we know the majority of people want it, we need it for economic development, we need it to make our roads safer.\" The authority has said it would challenge the new guidance but remained determined to forge ahead with its planning application.\nBBC Wildlife presenter Chris Packham called it \"fantastic news... Not just for bats but for all biodiversity.

    "The UK Treasury sent staff to work at a Chinese bank accused of being \"dominated by the communist party\" in the last three years, the BBC can reveal.\nThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) was set up in 2015 as a Beijing-based rival to the World Bank.\nDavid Cameron's government joined the organisation during the so-called golden era of relations between the UK and China.\nLast year, Canada's government froze activity with the AIIB after a top Canadian official there alleged the organisation was an \"instrument\" of the Chinese government.\nAnd earlier on Tuesday Rishi Sunak insisted the UK's approach to China is \"more robust\" than most of its allies.\nHe told MPs: \"China represents the greatest state-based threat to our economic security.\"\nBob Pickard, who had served as the bank's global communications chief, claimed the influence of China's ruling communist party had become too great within the bank.\nData released to the BBC under Freedom of Information laws shows the AIIB is one of a small number of overseas organisations to have seconded staff from the Treasury in the last three years.\nThe other overseas organisations to have benefited from similar agreements are linked to the governments of France, Ireland, Canada, the United States and the Council of Europe.\nA spokesperson for the AIIB told the BBC that it takes staff on secondment from a number of its 109 member countries, including the UK.\nThey said \"the support of such secondees is valuable to support our work addressing climate change and other development goals\".\n'Complete shock'\nIt comes as the UK formally accused China of being behind \"malicious\" cyber attacks, escalating diplomatic tensions between the two countries.\nIt's not clear how many Treasury staff were seconded to the AIIB or in which of the last three years it happened.\nAn HM Treasury spokesperson said the UK's membership of the AIIB \"deepens economic ties with Asia and creates opportunities for British businesses\".\nThe spokesperson added: \"We pursue secondments with a wide range of partners to further the UK's interests.\"\nConservative MP Tim Loughton, who this week was named as a victim of Chinese cyber campaigns, said the news that the Treasury had sent staff to the AIIB was a \"complete shock\".\nHe told the BBC \"there are some serious questions raised about why we're doing it, what we're getting out of it and what the job of people seconded actually is\".\nHe is calling for an audit of the UK's relationship with the AIIB to figure out \"exactly what we have got out of it, what the UK taxpayer has got out of it\".\nThe UK's links with the AIIB have caused controversy in the past.\n'Sensational hype'\nFormer Liberal Democrat Treasury minister Sir Danny Alexander has been a vice president at the bank since 2016.\nLast year Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee said Sir Danny's appointment - along with the appointment of David Cameron at a separate investment fund - could have been \"engineered by the Chinese state to lend credibility to Chinese investment\".\nThe committee said the government must not allow a situation in which security concerns were \"constantly trumped by economic interest\".\nIt said that Russian money had previously become too embedded in society and warned that \"a similar situation might be arising in relation to China\".\nA spokesperson for the AIIB said the appointment of Sir Danny \"was made on the basis of his considerable experience and was agreed by unanimous consent of the Bank's board\".\nWhen Mr Pickard quit the bank last year, he told the Financial Times that he didn't want to be used as a \"useful idiot\".\nMr Pickard, formerly the bank's global communications chief, said members of the Chinese communist party operated \"like an invisible government inside the bank\".\nHe urged Western countries including Canada and the UK to sever ties with the AIIB.\nThe Chinese embassy in Canada described Mr Pickard's claims as \"purely sensational hype and outright lies\".\nThe AIIB has distanced itself from the comments made by its former employee Mr Pickard.\nA spokesperson for the bank pointed to a letter in the Economist newspaper that described Mr Pickard's allegations as \"personal and wild\".",
    "Harvard University has removed the binding of human skin from a 19th Century book kept in its library.\nDes Destin\u00c3\u00a9es de l'Ame (Destinies of the Soul) has been housed at Houghton Library since the 1930s.\nIn 2014, scientists determined that the material it was bound with was in fact human skin.\nBut the university has now announced it has removed the binding \"due to the ethically fraught nature of the book's origins and subsequent history\".\nDes Destin\u00c3\u00a9es de l'Ame is a meditation on the soul and life after death, written by Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Houssaye in the mid-1880s.\nHe is said to have given it to his friend, Dr Ludovic Bouland, a doctor, who then reportedly bound the book with skin from the body of an unclaimed female patient who had died of natural causes.\nHarvard University explained its decision to remove the binding, saying: \"After careful study, stakeholder engagement, and consideration, Harvard Library and the Harvard Museum Collections Returns Committee concluded that the human remains used in the book's binding no longer belong in the Harvard Library collections, due to the ethically fraught nature of the book's origins and subsequent history.\"\nIt added it was looking at ways to ensure \"the human remains will be given a respectful disposition that seeks to restore dignity to the woman whose skin was used\".\nThe library is also \"conducting additional biographical and provenance research into the anonymous female patient\", the university said.\nDes Destin\u00c3\u00a9es de l'Ame arrived at Harvard in 1934. Located within the book is a note written by Dr Bouland, stating no ornament had been stamped on the cover to \"preserve its elegance\".\n\"I had kept this piece of human skin taken from the back of a woman,\" he wrote. \"A book about the human soul deserved to have a human covering.\"\nA decade ago, Bill Lane, the director of the Harvard Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Resource Laboratory, told the Houghton Library Blog that it was \"very unlikely that the source could be other than human\".\n'An occasional practice'\nIn its statement, Harvard said its handling of the book had not lived up to the \"ethical standards\" of care and that in publicising it, it had on occasion used a \"sensationalistic, morbid and humorous tone\" which was not appropriate.\nIt apologised and said it had \"further objectified and compromised the dignity of the human being whose remains were used for its binding\".\nThe practice of binding books in human skin - termed anthropodermic bibliopegy - has been reported since as early as the 16th Century.\nNumerous 19th Century accounts exist of the bodies of executed criminals being donated to science, with their skins later given to bookbinders.\nSimon Chaplin, who in 2014 was head of the Wellcome Library, which holds books on medical history, told the BBC at the time: \"There are not a huge number of these books out there, it has been an occasional practice mainly done for generating a sense of vicarious excitement than for a practical motive.\n\"It generally seems to have been done in the 19th Century by doctors who had access to human bodies for dissection.\"",

    "Top Russian officials have directly accused Ukraine and the West of being involved in the deadly Moscow concert hall attack, after it was claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.\nIS has released video of the atrocity, but Vladimir Putin and two close allies have claimed the jihadists were helped by Western and Ukrainian intelligence.\nUkraine has rejected Russia's \"lies\".\nThe scenario is all the more unlikely because the US had warned Russia of an imminent attack 15 days earlier.\nRussia says 139 people were killed when four armed men burst into the Crocus City Hall concert complex on Friday evening. Another 22 remain in a serious condition, including two children, officials say.\nFour citizens of Tajikistan have appeared in court accused of carrying out the massacre. Four other suspects have been accused of aiding terrorism.\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the facts about the perpetrators and \"the failed incompetence of the Russian security services are indisputable\". Western countries have also ridiculed the Kremlin's narrative.\nThe Russian leader acknowledged during a televised meeting on Monday: \"We know the crime was committed by the hands of radical Islamists... we want to know who ordered it.\"\nHe argued that many questions remained unanswered, repeating an unfounded claim that the attackers had tried to flee south to Ukraine.\n\"Who was waiting for them there?\" he asked. \"This atrocity may be just a link in a whole series of attempts by those who have been at war with our country since 2014.\"\nThe US was trying to convince the world that Kyiv had no connection to the attack, he said, but he continued to point the finger at the West which he said was using Ukraine to fight against Russia.\nOne of Mr Putin's longest-serving allies, security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, doubled down on Mr Putin's claim on Tuesday when he was asked whether IS or Ukraine was behind the attack: \"Of course, Ukraine.\"\nThen the head of Russia's FSB security service, Alexander Bortnikov, went further.\n\"We believe the action was prepared both by the radical Islamists themselves and, obviously, facilitated by Western special services. Ukraine's special services themselves have a direct connection to this.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned the Russian accusations: \"Putin was talking to himself again... Again, he blames Ukraine. A sick and cynical creature.\"\nBelarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, appeared to cast doubt on the Russian narrative too, by suggesting the attackers had first tried to cross into his country before realising \"there was no way they could enter Belarus\".\nThe US has said IS is \"solely\" to blame for the Moscow attack and France's Emmanuel Macron said it would be \"both cynical and counterproductive\" for Russia to try to exploit the situation to seek to turn it against Ukraine.\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said it was obvious Mr Putin was looking for pretexts to attack Kyiv, but said the videos of the attack were clear, and more than one IS claim confirmed the theory that it was involved.\nThe attack took place little over two weeks after the US embassy warned that \"extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts\". Mr Putin rejected the warning as provocative only last week.\nThree days before the gunmen targeted Crocus City Hall on the north-west fringe of Moscow, the Russian leader accused the US of using its warning of an imminent attack to \"intimidate and destabilise our society\".\nMeanwhile, Russia's FSB announced on Tuesday that it had foiled an attack by pro-Ukraine Russian fighters in the southern city of Samara. It said a member of the Russian Volunteer Corps paramilitary group had blown himself up after being apprehended.\nThe Moscow attack, blamed by US intelligence on a regional branch of IS called Islamic State-Khorasan, has heightened fears of renewed jihadist plots in Western Europe, ahead of a summer of major international sporting events.\nFrench Interior Minister G\u00c3\u00a9rald Darmanin said on Monday night that France had been on maximum alert since Sunday night and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said two attacks had been foiled since the start of the year.\n\"We thwart a lot of attacks in France, one every two months,\" Mr Darmanin said on France 2 TV. Paris is due to host the Olympic Games in fourth months' time and the interior minister said the main threat was homegrown but the external IS threat was seeing a resurgence.\nMr Attal said 4,000 extra soldiers would be deployed across France in the coming days.\nGermany has said it will introduce temporary border controls for the European Championships starting in June.

A travel ban will also prevent them from entering or remaining in the UK.\n\"The UK will not tolerate malicious cyber activity,\" Mr Dowden said. \"It is an absolute priority for the UK government to protect our democratic system and values.\"\nThe Chinese ambassador is being called in to be held \"to account for China's conduct in these incidents\", Mr Dowden added.\nThe US has announced that the same two Chinese nationals are among a group of seven facing criminal charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusions and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in New York.\nAuthorities in New Zealand have also accused China of targeting its parliamentary network in 2021, with the country's defence minister Judith Collins saying the Chinese state-sponsored group known as APT40 was behind the hacking activity.\nBut New Zealand said it would not introduce sanctions, as it was not part of the government's legislative agenda.\nThe cyber attack on the UK Electoral Commission between August 2021 and October 2022 was one of the most significant in British history.\nNot only were databases containing names and addresses of people accessed, but also sensitive emails from its \"control systems\" and between election officials over six by-elections.\nHowever, Mr Dowden said the security of elections had not been compromised and \"typically does not create a risk to those affected\".\n'Watershed moment'\nThe MPs targeted are all members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China , which scrutinises, and often criticises, the activities of Beijing.\nFormer Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, former minister Tim Loughton and the SNP's Stewart McDonald all faced harassment, failed hacks and impersonations by groups seeking to influence foreign dignitaries.\nMr McDonald said the response from the UK was like turning up to a \"gun fight with a wooden spoon\".\nAll three MPs are calling for the UK to go further and send a clear message, designating China \"a threat\".\nSir Iain called for more sanctions against Chinese government actors, describing the deputy prime minister's statement as \"like an elephant giving birth to a mouse\".\nBut he also called the announcement \"a watershed moment where the UK takes a stand for human rights and an international rules-based system\".\nHe said a combative proponent of the Chinese government, known as a \"wolf warrior\", had been sending emails impersonating him and falsely suggesting he had altered his views on Beijing.\nChina should be placed in the \"enhanced tier\" of the new foreign influence registration scheme, which would increase scrutiny on Chinese government-backed operations in the UK.\nSir Iain said: \"The West has to wake up to the fact this is a challenge to the very way that we live our lives.\n\"To our belief in democracy, human rights, freedom of expression, freedom of worship. These are the things that we hold dear, but we seem reluctant to want to defend those against the others who hold none of those virtues and values and want to take ours from us.\"\nSir Iain and Mr Loughton were among among nine UK citizens sanctioned by China over exposing human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority group.\nMr Loughton warned China was \"in the business of trying to influence elections and democracies as well\".\nHe said: \"We need much more robust action to show China that this is absolutely unacceptable and there are consequences and those consequences will be followed through. But at the moment, they're not.\"\nGovernment concern\nLabour said it would support the government to counter state actors trying to \"interfere with or undermine the electoral process\".\nMr Dowden credited the Defending Democracy taskforce, a committee that tracks election threats, with pinpointing China-affiliated organisations and individuals behind cyber operations.\nSanctioning groups linked to China, a fellow member of the UN Security Council, is an escalation in the diplomatic tension between the two countries.\nThis marks a major change from just a few years ago, when British leaders aimed to usher in a \"Golden Age\" with China.\nThe prime minister then was David Cameron, who is n",
    "The government has been urged by MPs to hold a public inquiry into the murder of two-year-old James Bulger.\nThe toddler was kidnapped and tortured by two 10-year-old boys in 1993.\nA debate was triggered six years after 213,000 people signed a petition calling for answers as to why one of his killers, Jon Venables, was freed and went on to commit more offences.\nThe government has said a full inquiry is \"not necessary\".\nJames was led away from the New Strand shopping centre in Bootle by Venables and his accomplice, Robert Thompson, while his mum, Denise Fergus, paid for her shopping.\nVenables served eight years of his life sentence before being freed on licence.\nBoth killers were handed new identities protected by a court injunction ordering life-time anonymity.\nVenables has repeatedly re-offended, and the petition called for questions to be asked about Venables's time in the prison system, and why experts believed he had been rehabilitated when he was released.\nPaula Barker, Labour MP for Wavertree, told ministers at Westminster Hall on Monday: \"If there is nothing to see here, let us have all the facts laid bare.\"\nMs Barker said \"even after Hillsborough\" the \"penny does not seem to have dropped\" that victims should be afforded greater transparency.\nShe added: \"To lose a child in such circumstances should never happen, for his family to still be fighting for justice 31 years later should never have to happen, and it is unbelievably cruel.\"\nSir George Howarth, Labour MP for Knowsley, also called for a public inquiry and suggested the government's response on how the transparency of the Parole Board's decisions could be improved has been \"overly defensive and vague\".\nMr Howarth said: \"There's a feeling, which Denise and other family members have, that they haven't been taken seriously when they've raised concerns, and there are things that should be done to expose what's gone wrong.\"\nHe added: \"The government in their response to the petition initially ruled out a public inquiry, and I think that would be the best way of doing it, to be perfectly honest, as does, I think, Denise and the other family members.\n\"But if he came up with an alternative proposal, which would do the same thing, then we'd certainly, I'm sure, look at it.\"\n'Danger to children'\nVenables was released on licence in July 2001 and recalled to prison in February 2010 after indecent images of children were found on his computer.\nHe was freed in August 2013 and then recalled to prison in November 2017 for the same offence and jailed for three years and four months.\nIn December last year, the Parole Board made the decision not to release Venables from jail because he continued to pose a danger to children and could go on to offend again.\nJess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham, Yardley, said the \"standard of communication\" which should have been afforded to Mrs Fergus \"has not been delivered\", and raised concerns about the treatment of other parents in similar situations.\nShe added: \"The point of having public inquiry and truth and justice seeking reviews, isn't just for retribution, isn't just to satisfy and tick a box for a grieving family, it is to ensure that our systems are correct.\"\nJustice minister Edward Argar said: \"While I do fully appreciate the significant concerns that have been expressed and indeed the strength and sincerity of the feelings on this issue, I am not in a position today to announce a public inquiry, though I appreciate that will be disappointing.\"\nMr Argar offered to meet with Sir George and other MPs to discuss the issue further, but added: \"I don't want to raise expectations that I can't meet, and I don't intend to do that, but I will have a conversation.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Some grassy areas managed by Plymouth City Council will not be mown as part of a strategy to help support wildlife.\nThe council said 40% of the city's grassland would be \"left to grow wild\" between March and September.\nThe remaining 60% of grassland would continue to be cut on a regular basis as it is used by people, the authority said.\nIt said leaving grass to grow wild created a habitat for pollinating insects including bees and butterflies.\nThe council said the strategy made sure Plymouth \"does its bit for the biodiversity crisis\".\n'Right thing to do'\nCouncillor Tom Briars-Delve, cabinet member for the environment and climate change, said it was \"great\" to see more colour in the city after the policy was first introduced a few years ago.\n\"To ensure that it's a policy that works for residents as well as wildlife we have to make sure that we cut the 60% we say we'll cut,\" he said.\n\"This year, we've invested \u00c2\u00a3300,000 in additional resource with dedicated teams assigned to cutting play areas and cemeteries.\"\nMr Briars-Delve said the number of permanent staff maintaining grass areas had increased.\n\"We know the 60-40 approach is the right thing to do,\" he said.\n\"We're far more likely to get the buy in from residents we need to give nature a boost if we ensure we do what we say we will and keep the areas that our residents cherish regularly cut.\"\nThe council manages about 1,000 football pitches of land across the city including sports pitches, parks, play areas, wildlife meadows, roadside verges and community spaces.\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter) , Facebook and Instagram .

    "Hundreds of drug users in Scotland have been given phones, tablets and laptops as part of a scheme to help them rebuild their lives.\nThe initiative, which is part of a \u00c2\u00a33m project aimed at improving digital inclusion, also pays for a data plan.\nOrganisers said the scheme provided access to areas of life most of us take for granted - such as connection to family and friends, online banking, health and social care access and entertainment.\nLaunched in April 2021, Digital Lifelines supports organisations who work with people at greatest risk of harm from drugs.\nSo far, more than 1,700 people have taken part. A total of 908 phones, 103 laptops and 45 other devices have been distributed, along with almost 1,500 connectivity packages with unlimited data.\nMany of those in the programme have experienced homeless, while others have been released from custody or undergone treatment for drug or alcohol addiction. They may have little to no digital skills.\nGreig, 51, is originally from Bathgate, but moved to Edinburgh after his heroin addiction caused problems with his family.\nHe was homeless for four years, and was then in and out of hostels. He was one of the very first to take part in the project.\n\"It was my support worker from Streetwork that said I could get a phone,\" he said.\n\"They set me up with a phone, six-month contract, six-month Wi-Fi. When I got it, I was still involved in drugs a wee bit and I lost the phone - but they were really good, they got me a phone straight away after I lost it. I have had this one for over a year now.\"\nGreig is now in a stable living situation and is studying art at college.\n\"It's been so helpful for my artwork, getting on to the internet, getting ideas,\" he said.\n\"It really gives you a sense of responsibility to look after something and that's quite good because I am looking after myself as well, so it comes together.\"\nDigital Lifelines is funded by the Scottish government's digital health and care and its drugs policy divisions, and the drugs death taskforce.\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the scheme was well-intentioned but questioned whether it was the most appropriate use of public money.\n\"In particular, many will wonder about the commitment to giving unlimited data packages, when these aren't accessible to everyone during a cost-of-living crisis,\" said MSP Sue Webber.\nGeorgina Davis is the digital inclusion officer with the Simon Community, a charity that works with the homeless. She said that, in her experience, the vast majority of phones were not misused, and that a only handful had been lost or stolen.\n\"That's always a risk but what we have seen as an overall percentage its extremely low,\" she said.\n\"It does so much for them, whether it's contact, connectivity or just entertainment.\n\"For anyone who thinks the devices would be misused for other purposes, the overwhelming majority of devices are well loved and well used.\"\nShaun, from Edinburgh, started drinking at a young age and later moved on to drugs including heroin and then street valium. Fearing for his health, his children asked him to get help.\nThe 45-year-old went into a treatment centre and has now been clean for almost two months. He says he takes it day by day and is using his phone to video message his children and access support groups online.\n\"There are recovery groups all over Scotland so I can get in touch with people. I can phone people from meetings anytime, it's a big help,\" he said.\n\"It's not just that, being on jobseekers allowance you have to be looking for a job 24/7. I was going on the computers before I had the phone but I am dyslexic so it was hard.\n\"When you asked for help they could only spend five minutes with you. It's a bit easier now.\"\nSince leaving treatment, Shaun has also been able to reconnect with his oldest children and his grandchildren.\n\"I took my granddaughter to the pictures. Seeing her, it's like going back to when I was bringing my kids up.\n\"My daughter didn't let me see her when I was on the drugs but now it's completely different.\"\nCarrie Thomson from the Digital Health and Care Innovation Centre leads the project.\nShe said: \"We all take access to digital services for granted, and it's not until you don't have access that the consequences are truly felt.\n\"So much of life - communication, banking, travel, shopping, and access to healthcare - is now reliant on online, and those on the outside of the digital circle are shut off and the impact can be hugely damaging.\"\nA number of apps have also been created specifically for those with experience of addiction.\nThe By My Side app, developed by the Simon Community, gives access to dedicated support and information for those with a drug dependence.\nNalofly uses a GPS signal to alert people carrying Naloxone - a medication used to reverse opioid overdose - to a possible overdose.\nNaloxone is carried by emergency services but also is offered to those who use drugs.\nThe hope is that the phones could be used by people to seek help in e",

    "Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The small town that made the big hits.\nThirty miles south of Tennessee, and two hours east of Memphis, it originally formed part of the historic Cherokee hunting grounds, but became an unlikely staging post for rock and R&B royalty in the 1960s and 70s.\nActs like Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Etta James and Paul Simon all made the pilgrimage to this backwater town, where the nicest hotel was a Holiday Inn and the restaurants served local specialties like fried catfish and turnip greens.\nWhat drew them there was The Swampers - a crack team of studio musicians, whose rich, funky Southern grooves infused classics like Aretha Franklin's Respect, The Rolling Stones' Brown Sugar and The Staples Singers' I'll Take You There.\nPart of the attraction was the town's disregard for the segregation that divided the South. The local radio station, WLAY, was unusual for playing music by both white and black artists; and the colour-blind approach was duplicated in the local recording studios.\n\"It was a dangerous time, but the studio was a safe haven where blacks and whites could work together in musical harmony,\" said Rick Hall, who owned and operated the FAME Studios from the 1950s until his death in 2018.\nThat gave this small, backwater town its distinctive sound: An intoxicating amalgam of gritty R&B, gospel and country, that soundtracked more than 500 singles, including 75 gold and platinum hits.\nAccording to former curator of Alabama's Music Hall of Fame, George Lair, the Muscle Shoals sound was a product of geography.\n\"You can draw a triangle from Nashville to Memphis to Muscle Shoals, and while Nashville is the country centre, Memphis is generally known as the blues centre,\" he told NPR in 2023 . \"Muscle Shoals, being between those two places, has been able to combine those two styles into a real Southern rhythm and blues that was very appealing.\"\nAt their peak, the Muscle Shoals' players were largely anonymous but music obsessives - the sort of people who pored over the liner notes of their vinyl albums - knew all about them: Keyboardist Barry Beckett, drummer Roger Hawkins, guitarist Jimmy Johnson, bassist David Hood and pianist Spooner Oldham.\nAmong those obsessives, all the way over in Balloch, Scotland, was Sharleen Spiteri, the future singer of rock band Texas.\n\"We all knew the story of when Aretha went to Muscle Shoals and she thought she was going to record with these old blues guys; then she turned up and it was this group of geeky white blokes,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"But when they played, she was like, 'This is what I've been looking for', and she overruled everybody and put them on her record.\"\nSo when she got the opportunity to record at FAME studios with Oldham - who'd helped Aretha shape the sound of I Never Loved A Man (The Way That I Love You) - her answer was an emphatic \"yes\".\n\"It's pretty damn special,\" she says. \"I don't think anything's changed in the studio over the years. Inspiration is soaked into the wooden panels on the walls.\"\nSome musicians might have been apprehensive about living up to the studio's legacy - but not her.\n\"I don't really get intimidated by stuff like that,\" she laughs.\n\"I'm like a peacock. My tail feather starts wagging, like, 'Oh my God, we're gonna be part of history'.\"\nThe results are gorgeous. Classic Texas songs like Halo, Say What You Want and I Don't Want A Lover are purified in the swampy waters of the Tennessee River, and reborn with a spacious, soulful clarity.\nSpiteri says the tracks were laid down almost spontaneously in the summer of 2022.\n\"It was me sitting on the piano stool next to Spooner, tapping out the timing on his leg.\n\"A lot of the songs were first take, which is quite extraordinary because we didn't rehearse it.\n\"He'd start playing and find a certain rhythm that's not on the original [track] and suddenly we'd be dancing around each other, making new versions of a song that I thought I knew really well.\"\nThe new arrangements emphasise the sumptuous timbre of Spiteri's contralto, adding fresh intimacy to familiar melodies.\nThe opening track, Halo, is stripped of its pop sheen and presented as a gospel devotional, with Oldham at the organ and the backing vocalists summoning a ghostly spirituality.\n\"When we hit record, I was literally like, 'Holy cow',\" says Spiteri. \"It's so emotional, and I think you can really feel the joy in the little exchanges between us.\"\nBut before she got too carried away, reality intruded.\n\"The thing is, even when we were making a record at Muscle Shoals we had to stop every day at one o'clock because they had a guided tour,\" laughs Spiteri. \"That's how they make ends meet.\"\nIt's a harsh reality of modern music. Bands rarely record live to tape any more, with most albums pieced together on laptops.\nAs a result, storied recording studios like Muscle Shoals and FAME are either closing or finding new ways to survive.\n\"It's so tight now,\" says Spiteri.\n\"You can't go to your record company and say, 'Okay, we'r",

    "A five-year plan to make the air in Cambridge cleaner has been put together as councillors said there was \"no safe level of air pollution\".\nCambridge City Council and South Cambridgeshire District Council have set out a joint strategy to reduce pollution across the areas.\nCouncillors in Cambridge said there was still more to be done to improve air quality in the city.\nThe city council endorsed the strategy at a meeting this week.\nRosy Moore, executive councillor for climate action and environment, said the city now met the legal standards for air quality. However, she believed the new strategy would help the authorities to be \"more ambitious\".\nShe said: \"We should not be kidding ourselves that just because we are achieving the national targets that our air is good enough.\n\"It is good to note things have improved but there is still a way to go.\"\nThe strategy document highlighted traffic on Cambridge's roads as being the the main contributor of nitrogen-dioxide emissions.\nTo address it, the plan set out a number of points including supporting public transport, consolidating freight and looking at last-mile deliveries, improving cycling and walking routes, and encouraging people to use \"green infrastructure\".\nThe report said: \"Greater Cambridge is a major growth area with large-scale development and population increase coming forward in the next 10 to 20 years.\n\"This strategy seeks to strike a balance in supporting the productivity, economy and prosperity of Greater Cambridge, whilst continuing to deliver improvements in air quality and the positive health outcomes that improved air quality will deliver for both residents and visitors to the Greater Cambridge area.\"\nOfficers said air quality in the city had improved over the past 30 years and said the authority could do more to highlight how much progress had been made.\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service reported that the environment and community scrutiny committee voted unanimously on behalf of the full council to support the new strategy, which it proposed should be in place until 2029.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Vladimir Putin has acknowledged \"radical Islamists\" carried out last week's deadly Moscow concert hall attack.\nBut despite the Islamic State (IS) group claiming responsibility, the Russian president continues to insist Ukraine was involved.\nThrough Russian officials' statements, media reports, and social media posts, BBC Verify examines how the campaign to blame Kyiv unfolded.\nFirst accusations\nAccusations were made almost immediately after initial reports of the attack on the Crocus City Hall emerged on social media at 1715 GMT on Friday.\nSeveral pro-Kremlin bloggers and some officials posting to the messaging app Telegram blamed Ukraine within just over an hour.\nPro-Russia pundit Sergey Markov, for example, said at 1825 GMT the attackers looked like \"Islamist radicals\", but went on to add - without evidence - that the attack was \"likely organised from Kyiv\".\nSome 40 minutes later (1903 GMT), Moskovsky Komsomolets, a national tabloid, quoted military expert Roman Shkurlatov as saying the attack may have been organised with the support of Ukraine's Security Service and military intelligence.\nAnd at 1927 GMT, Russia's ex-President Dmitry Medvedev vowed revenge if Ukraine was involved.\nThe fake claim of responsibility\nA few hours later, at 2213 GMT, NTV - one of Russia's main TV channels - aired a video clip, claiming that it showed a senior Ukrainian official confirming his country's involvement\nIn the video, Oleksiy Danilov appears to say: \"It is fun in Moscow today, I think it's a lot of fun. I would like to believe that we will arrange such fun for them more often.\"\nBut BBC Verify has established the clip is actually an edit of two Ukrainian TV interviews broadcast in the past week.\nBoth can be found on YouTube. The first is an interview with Danilov from 19 March . The other one was published three days earlier and features Ukraine's military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov.\nThe quote by Danilov which appears in the NTV video cannot be heard in the original interview.\nAudio analysis, carried out for BBC Verify by the Advanced Forensic Technology Research Group at Liverpool John Moores University, suggests the audio was manipulated in the NTV video.\nA gap in the audio frequency data indicates that the sound has been edited. However, the researchers cannot be certain the voice was AI generated.\nBBC Verify has also found information embedded in the audio file suggesting it has been put through editing software.\n'Window' for crossing\nAn official accusation was made in Vladimir Putin's address on Saturday.\nThe Russian president said the assailants were caught as they were trying to flee to Ukraine, where \"a window for crossing the border was prepared for them\".\nHowever, Russia has not presented evidence of a \"window\" to let the attackers through.\nAlthough BBC Verify cannot independently confirm where the suspects were heading, we have verified several videos and photos of them being apprehended. And despite Putin's claim, the arrests took place a long way from the Ukrainian border.\nBy matching background details in their environment, we know two of the arrested suspects were filmed at about 90 miles (145km) from the Ukraine border.\nWhile Ukraine has denied any involvement, responsibility has been claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group via its self-styled Amaq news agency.\nVisual evidence, circulated by IS, includes a picture of four attackers with their faces blurred and a very graphic video filmed from one of the assailant's perspectives.\nMultiple details - like features of the concert hall and guns used by the attackers - match videos that emerged online at the time of the attack.\nBut despite the evidence, Russia continues to accuse Ukraine.\nMargarita Simonyan - editor in chief of the Russian TV network RT (previously known as Russia Today) - said on X the attackers were not from IS because they were not wearing suicide vests and \"had no intention to die\".\nBut while IS has repeatedly warned assailants against getting caught alive, the group's attackers have escaped before.\nFor example, in late 2022 one of the militants involved in an attack on a hotel in Kabul managed to escape and later carried out a suicide attack, according to IS media observed by BBC Monitoring.\nWhat do we know about the suspects?\nThe attackers drove in a white Renault - which matches the vehicle seen in a separate video used to flee the concert hall - before being detained.\nAccording to Russian State Duma deputy Alexander Khinshtein , one man was arrested near the vehicle, while the other three fled into nearby woods and were detained following a search.\nWeapons and Tajik passports were recovered from the Renault, Mr Khinshtein added.\nOn Sunday, footage was published of the men being escorted into a Moscow court. They were named by Russian authorities as: Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov.\nIn the picture released by IS, three of the suspects can be seen wearing a lig",
    "Four private colleges described as being \"dysfunctional\" have been ordered to close in South Africa, leaving thousands of students in limbo.\nThey had fabricated exam results, as well as other issues, said Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande.\nThe institutions have failed to submit audited financial statements since 2020, the education department said.\nThe colleges are owned by Educor, one of the largest private education providers in southern Africa.\nEducor is yet to respond to a BBC inquiry about the allegations.\nIt runs educational institutions on more than 60 campuses in South Africa and internationally.\nThe colleges, Damelin, CityVarsity, Icesa City Campus and Lyceum College located around the country, have been given until the end of the year to cease operations.\nHigher Education Minister Blade Nzimande told journalists that after a large-scale investigation into the colleges, serious issues had been brought to his attention.\nMr Nzimande labelled the colleges \"dysfunctional\" due to a number of complaints received from students and workers, \"most of which remain unresolved\".\nSome students complained about the poor quality of teaching and learning, lack of administrative support and lack of professionalism, the minister said.\nThere have been allegations of non-payment of staff salaries and corruption, he added.\nThe Educor institutions also inflated their numbers so as to hide their declining student population, according to the minister.\nThe provider said it had 50,000 students, however its 2022 annual reports indicate a total enrolment of 13,096 students across all four institutions, he said.\nMr Nzimande also said that some students' examination marks were fabricated.\n\"That's the worst sin that can be committed by an education institution, whether public or private \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you cannot just lie and give students marks based on scripts that were never marked,\" the minister said.\nAdditionally, the colleges are said to have failed to submit audited annual financial statements and to obtain tax clearance to prove their financial viability.\nThe Department of Higher Education and Training has been in the process of deregistering the private institutions since July 2023 but the final decision was made last Friday.\nMore than 13,000 students will be affected by the decision, with some left stranded without accommodation.\nEducation authorities have urged affected students to transfer to other institutions.\nParents have been visiting the colleges to demand answers and fees that they had paid for the year's tuition.\nThe South African Union of Students welcomed the deregistration of the colleges, saying the decision was in the best interests of students, local media reported.\nThe South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) said Educor had been \"mistreating employees and students for too long\".\nMore South Africa stories from the BBC:",
    "Two men have been found guilty of murdering a footballer who was stabbed to death on the dance floor of a nightclub over a petty incident two days earlier.\nCody Fisher, 23, was attacked by a masked group at the Crane club in Birmingham, with more than 2,000 people inside, on 26 December 2022.\nIt was in revenge after he had brushed past Remy Gordon, 23, in a busy bar.\nGordon and Kami Carpenter, 22, were convicted of murder on Monday.\nMr Fisher's mother Tracey described the pair as \"evil\".\nThe weapon - a six-inch long blade, serrated on both sides - was left buried in her son's chest. It had been smuggled into the club, the court heard, with prosecutors describing cursory security checks on the night.\nAs well as being a semi-professional footballer, Mr Fisher had taught PE in schools and his mother said he had loved teaching young children.\n\"He had more living to do and so much more love and kindness to give to the world,\" she said.\nA third defendant Reegan Anderson, 19, was found not guilty of murder after the 10-week trial.\nThe court heard Mr Fisher made \"unavoidable\" contact with Gordon in a trivial incident at Popworld, in Solihull on Christmas Eve, which led to him trying to track him down.\nProsecutor Michael Duck KC told jurors there was \"no doubt\" Gordon was looking for trouble and wanted Mr Fisher to apologise and \"seek his forgiveness\".\nBut he was not going to apologise because he had done nothing wrong, he said.\nLess than an hour after the encounter that night in Popworld, Gordon sent messages in a Snapchat group he was in with several friends appealing for help to identify Mr Fisher and threatened to \"shank him up\".\n\"Who knows this likkle pip squeeze [sic]?\" he posted with a photograph and arrow pointing to Mr Fisher, along with comments of \"man think he's bad\" and \"posh yout\".\nMr Duck said Gordon, of Cofton Park Drive, Birmingham, was \"set on retribution\" and that \"ultimately was to lead to the loss of Cody Fisher's young life in the Crane nightclub\".\nJurors were told of other messages in the defendants' Snapchat group in the days before the Crane event in which Gordon and Carpenter talked about whether masks could be worn and if weapons could be taken inside the club.\nMr Fisher, a former Birmingham City FC academy member who had also played for a number of non-league Midlands clubs, including Bromsgrove Sporting and Stratford Town, had gone to the Digbeth nightclub with his girlfriend, best friend Dan Vann and others to see a DJ they liked.\nSam Newey, a close friend of Mr Fisher, who had met Gordon some six months earlier, told jurors how he had tried to persuade Mr Fisher to leave Crane, after seeing Gordon and several others wearing ski masks and balaclavas several hours before the attack.\nHe said Gordon had asked him \"is your boy Cody here?\" and he replied he was not. However, Mr Newey said he became concerned \"we were going to be outnumbered and obviously potentially get hurt\".\nShortly after 23:30 GMT, up to 10 men approached Mr Fisher who was standing with his girlfriend Jess Chatwin and best friend Dan Vann.\nMr Vann told the court the \"large crowd\" with masks \"up to their noses\" asked Mr Fisher to go outside before one headbutted him, knocking \"his head backwards\" before punches were then thrown.\nHe then fell to the floor after being stabbed in the chest and leg. CPR was administered by security staff, but the blade had penetrated the main valve to his heart, a post-mortem examination later showed.\nHis killers left the event, but just 45 minutes later, CCTV showed Gordon \"mocking and smiling\" about the stabbing, the court heard.\nHe went to a pizza takeaway where he was seen on cameras smiling as he made a kicking motion \"and repeating what had taken place\".\nCarpenter, who left the club in his Audi with a friend, admitted to him he had stabbed an individual in the chest and left the weapon at the scene, the jury heard.\nHe arrived there in different clothes and bought a pizza an hour after the murder.\nThe group Snapchat also contained messages from their associates saying the club had been taped off and \"man says he's dead\" with another replying \"he is\" and \"Ah, good he's deffo dead\".\nMr Newey had also told jurors how Gordon had rung him after the stabbing and said during a nine-minute call: \"Literally instantly, the first thing he said was 'I am not going to lie, I have just banged both your boys out.'\"\nHe said Gordon, of Cofton Park Drive, Birmingham, told him he had \"just wrapped up Cody and wrapped up Dan, knocked 'em both clean out'....they are not awake'.\"\nThe case was brought as a joint enterprise prosecution where more than one person can be prosecuted for a murder if they were involved and had foreseen that Mr Fisher might be killed or seriously hurt.\nAnalysis - Midlands correspondent Phil Mackie:\nIt's hard to think of something more innocuous. Everyone will have, at some point, gently moved someone out of the way when leaving a crowded venue. In Cody Fisher's case it cost him his li",

    "A Yorkshireman's collection of 300 model trains has gone under the hammer, after never running on a track.\nAndrew Carmichael spent 50 years amassing the vast collection of locomotives but was \"only interested in building them\".\nAfter his death nine years ago, his wife Evelyn said the models had been left \"undisturbed\".\nHowever, due to her downsizing to a new property, she no longer had the space to store the collection.\nInstead, the model trains went up for auction at the David Duggleby saleroom in Scarborough on Friday, where they fetched \u00c2\u00a38,000.\n\"It's very tough because it's been nine years since he died and the collection has been left undisturbed all that time,\" Mrs Carmichael told BBC Radio York.\n\"He started his collection just after we were married and that was 60 years ago.\n\"He always had an interest in steam trains, following holidays that he used to spend with a very dear uncle of his, who was stationmaster at St Neots in Cambridgeshire.\"\nAfter the couple were married, they spent time visiting heritage railway lines around the country, which inspired Mr Carmichael to start his collection.\nHe kept them in the basement of his home, but never owned a layout or a single loop of track to run them on.\n\"We had a large loft, if he wanted, he could have built a track up there, but the only thing he was interested in was building them,\" Mrs Carmichael said.\n\"He didn't build them from scratch, he always made them from white metal kits.\"\nThe huge collection of trains, building parts, and cabinets was separated into 104 different lots for auction.\nAlthough Mrs Carmichael said the money was not important to her, the collection fetched more than \u00c2\u00a38000.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "A man has been convicted of stalking his wife who he caught having sex with a married police inspector in a Screwfix car park.\nGavin Harper, 45, confronted Stephanie Glynn, 40, after she had driven to meet Andrew McLullich of Merseyside Police.\nThe court heard Harper subjected Ms Glynn to \"obsessive, intrusive and unwanted behaviour\".\nA jury could not reach a verdict on the allegation that Harper unlawfully wounded his wife's new lover.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service said it would return to court on 2 April when it would announce whether a re-trial would be sought on the alleged unlawful wounding offence.\nHarper, from Liscard in Wirral, followed his police officer wife Ms Glynn, 40, using a tracker he had placed on her car as she drove to the car park in Birkenhead to meet her colleague Insp McLullich, 42.\nOn Monday, the jury at Liverpool Crown Court found Harper guilty by majority decision of the aggravated stalking of Ms Glynn, causing her serious alarm or distress, between December 2020 and February 2021.\nThe Crown said Harper, himself a former police officer, subjected Ms Glynn to \"obsessive, intrusive and unwanted behaviour\" including spying on her, secretly bugging her car, listening into her conservations, tracking her whereabouts and taking her phone without her permission.\nThe court heard Harper met Ms Glynn when they both worked at Merseyside Police, and they were in a six-year relationship before they married in 2018.\nHowever Ms Glynn left the family home in December 2020, after she grew close to her \"work mentor\" Mr McLullich.\nThe prosecution said Harper could not accept the marriage breakdown and became \"obsessed with catching her in the act\", which he finally did on 16 February 2021.\n'Unhinged'\nMs Glynn, now divorced, was said to be \"sickeningly anxious\" as a result of Harper's behaviour and told the jury she \"constantly looked over her shoulder\", had changed her routes to work and had undergone counselling.\nThe Crown alleged Harper \"rained\" punches on the then-inspector after he opened the rear passenger door of the vehicle.\nThe prosecution further alleged that when Mr McLullich tried to stop Harper retrieving a tracker from underneath Ms Glynn's car, Harper responded by striking him, possibly with a torch, to the top of his head.\nHarper denied causing cuts to Mr McLullich's head with, or without, a torch.\nGiving evidence, Harper said he did not have violence on his mind when he arrived at the car park and just wanted \"undeniable proof\" of the affair which Ms Glynn had persistently denied.\nHarper argued Mr McLullich was the aggressor and it was he who started throwing punches from inside of the vehicle. Harper said he had hit Mr McLullich with \"three, four\" punches in self-defence.Harper was granted conditional bail ahead of his next court appearance but was told by Judge David Potter he faced an immediate custodial sentence.\nWhy not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Bruce Springsteen is to receive one of the highest honours in songwriting: Fellowship of the Ivors Academy.\nThe star will be the first US musician to be given the prize, which recognises writing that has enriched the cultural fabric of the UK.\nOnly 26 other people have ever received the fellowship, including Sir Elton John, Sir Paul McCartney and Kate Bush.\nLast year, the prize went to Sting, who used the opportunity to warn of the dangers that AI posed to songwriters.\nSpringsteen was born to a working class family in New Jersey in 1949 and, like many of his contemporaries, was inspired to pursue music after seeing Elvis Presley on the Ed Sullivan TV show.\nAfter an apprenticeship in bar bands he launched himself as a solo artist, signing a deal with Columbia Records and releasing his first album, Greetings from Asbury Park, in 1973.\nThe album and its follow-up, The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, did not sell particularly well. Instead, his reputation was made as a live performer.\nIn 1974, music critic Jon Landau reviewed one of his shows with The E Street Band in Boston and enthused: \"I saw rock and roll['s] future and its name is Bruce Springsteen.\"\nLandau and Springsteen became friends, and worked together on a third album - Born To Run - which transformed the musician into a full-fledged rock star.\nHeavily indebted to Phil Spector's Wall Of Sound and Roy Orbison's spine-tingling vocals, it sold nine million copies and saw Springsteen achieve the rare feat of appearing on the covers of Time and Newsweek magazine in the same week.\nOne of the hardest-working entertainers in showbusiness, he built up a fearsome reputation for his sweat-drenched concerts, which regularly run for over three hours.\nSomewhat unexpectedly, he also became one of the breakout stars of early MTV, with videos for songs like Hungry Heart and Dancing In The Dark on heavy rotation alongside hits by Madonna, Michael Jackson and Prince.\nHis biggest album was 1984's Born In The USA, which sold 15 million copies in the US and 30 million worldwide and spawned hit singles like Glory Days, I'm On Fire and My Hometown.\nAfter such huge success, he stepped away from his longtime companions, The E Street Band, and subsequent albums varied in quality.\nIn the 1990s, he earned an Oscar for the theme song to the Tom Hanks' Aids drama, Philadelphia; and a 1995 greatest hits album topped the charts, selling four million copies.\nAfter reconvening the E Street Band at the turn of the millennium, Springsteen began a creative hot-streak that has yet to fade - with highlights including 2002's The Rising, a response to the 11 September terror attacks; 2012's politically-charged Wrecking Ball and 2019's Western Stars, a homage to the 1970s-era golden age of the Laurel Canyon pop.\nHe was inducted to the Rock Hall of Fame in 1999, and played the Super Bowl half-time show 10 years later.\nIn 2016, the star released his autobiography, also titled Born To Run, and staged a series of intimate, one-man Broadway shows looking back at his life and career.\nInitially planned for eight weeks, it ended up running for two years, commanding an average ticket price of $500 (\u00c2\u00a3395).\nThe Covid-19 pandemic put him in a contemplative mood, and he spent lockdown recording covers of his favourite songs, including Jimmy Ruffin's What Becomes Of The Broken Hearted and The Walker Brothers' The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Any More.\nThose sessions became his 21st album, Only The Strong Survive, in 2022 - with a second volume due for release later this year.\nSince 2023, he's also been back on the road with the E Street Band, playing stadiums and festivals around the world  - although he was forced to postpone several shows last year to receive treatment for peptic ulcer disease.\nHe recently said the condition, which causes open sores in the digestive system, had affected his ability to sing.\n\"You sing with your diaphragm. My diaphragm was hurting so badly that when I went to make the effort to sing, it was killing me, you know?\" the 74-year-old said in a recent interview on SiriusXM's E Street Radio with Jim Rotolo.\n\"So, I literally couldn't sing at all, you know, and that lasted for two or three months, along with just a myriad of other painful problems.\"\nNow recovered, he's due to play Sunderland's Stadium Of Light on 22 May, and will collect his Ivor Novello honour the following day in London.\nIn a statement, the star said he was \"proud\" to be the first international songwriter to receive the fellowship.\n\"In addition to recognising my songwriting, the award stands as a tribute to the fans and friends who have supported me and my work for the last 50 years,\" he said.\n\"This entire country has made me feel welcome every step of the way, and for this, I will always remain deeply appreciative.\"",

So I think they should just reconsider this and change it back,\" he said.\nNike says the shirt, launched earlier this week ahead of Euro 2024, includes \"a playful update to the cross of St George\" which \"appears on the collar to unite and inspire\".\nA Nike spokesperson told media outlets: \"The England 2024 Home kit disrupts history with a modern take on a classic,\" inspired by the training kit worn by England's 1966 World Cup winners.\nGoing on sale on 21 March, the \"authentic\" version is priced at \u00c2\u00a3124.99 for adults and \u00c2\u00a3119.99 for children, while a \"stadium\" version costs \u00c2\u00a384.99 and \u00c2\u00a364.99 for children.\nIt's understood the FA is standing by the Nike design and rejects any suggestion that they are trying to or want to change the St George's flag.\nThe flag traditionally features the St George's Cross bright red on a white background.\nFormer England goalkeeper Peter Shilton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he does not agree with the changes, saying \"I'm a traditionalist\".\nShilton, who played in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups and is the current record holder for most professional appearances, said the England football team represent the country, \"and red white and blue are the colours that we have on our flag\".\nHowever, England midfielder Declan Rice and Lionesses striker Alessia Russo both told England Football they rated the new kit as 10 out of 10.\nAdrian Bevington, former managing director at the FA, said he personally would not have signed off on this kit.\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast there would have been a lengthy process before the final design was agreed.\n\"My instinct would've been to say no. Reading the public room at this moment, I personally wouldn't have signed it off.\n\"The St George's Cross that flies above Wembley is good enough for me.\"\nIt's understood that the flag flying at Wembley stadium will not be changed.\nFormer UKIP leader and Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, speaking on GB News, said it was \"an absolute joke\" and that the new emblem \"bears no relationship to the St George's Cross whatsoever\".\nOn BBC Radio 5 Live's, Nicky Campbell programme, there was a passionate debate from callers across the country.\nTaxi driver Joe in Stirling said he had \"steam\" coming out of his ears: \"People died for that flag thousands of years ago\".\nLiz in Bury said she was \"incensed\" and that it was a matter of heritage.\nAlison from Harrogate said the red cross \"can look a little nationalistic,\" and felt the new kits were cool and modern.\nBill in Cwmbran said he found the whole thing \"utterly hilarious\" and didn't understand why people were getting upset about a shirt.\nMeanwhile, Katie in Clitheroe said she was surprised the debate was not focusing on the cost of the kit.\nEd Cowburn, who designs football kits for a living, told the Today programme that the St George's Cross only became a regular feature of the England kit from the early 2000s.\n\"The St George's Cross has probably only appeared on about six kits as a distinct graphic element,\" he said.\nHe added that the way the colour scheme was described - as an \"update\" - should have instead made it clear it was a \"graphic element\" relating to kit colours.\n\"You could even argue that the kit itself this time is one of the most traditional we've had for about 20 years, because it has the navy shorts and three lions badge in very traditional colours,\" he said.\nEngland's men's team are set to wear the new kits for the first time during matches with Brazil and Belgium at Wembley on 23 and 26 March.\nNike said the new design references the training kit of the 1966 World Cup winning team, which was a deep blue and featured blue, red and white stripes along the edges.\nA similar, though thinner, stripe pattern graces the cuffs of the shirts and hem of the shorts on the 2024 kit.\nThe outgoing 2022 kits did not feature the E",

    "West Midlands Mayor Andy Street and his election rival Richard Parker have both committed to funding the light rail system in Coventry.\nThe mayoral candidates faced questions about Very Light Rail (VLR) after the BBC learned the project's bid for government cash last year was rejected.\nMr Street said he had \"ring-fenced\" \u00c2\u00a372m in government money for VLR.\nBut Mr Parker said if elected he would revisit the scheme to make sure money was available more quickly.\nCoventry's VLR has been billed as a cheaper and faster-to-build alternative to traditional trams.\nThe programme to build it is being led by the Labour-run Coventry City Council, which hoped the first passenger route would be ready by 2025.\nThe VLR team asked the government for \u00c2\u00a336.8m in February 2023 and estimated the project would cost \u00c2\u00a3189m overall.\n'Reliable and cheap'\nBut senior civil servants threw out the council's bid for cash, meaning access to funding was restricted forcing delays in the work.\nIn a meeting about the project, civil servants questioned whether Coventry was the right place for a VLR system.\nThe government said it had approved \u00c2\u00a315m so far to support testing of VLR.\nMr Street said all cities needed \"public transport that's reliable and cheap\", adding he had been \"right behind\" VLR from the start.\nWhen asked if he could guarantee Coventry would get a VLR passenger service, Mr Street said he was confident that \"subject to the test, we expect to build the first track\".\n\"At the moment, it's planned solely for Coventry,\" the Conservative mayor added.\n'When is money available?'\nResponding to questions about the funding bid being rejected, a Department for Transport (DfT) spokesman said: \"It's essential that we consider and scrutinise business cases to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.\"\nMr Parker said he was \"committed to driving forward\" VLR and set out his ambition to promote the technology \"across the West Midlands, the UK and overseas\".\nLabour's mayoral candidate said he hoped to develop VLR \"far quicker than the government and the DfT is permitting\".\nHe said there had been lots of \"announcements but very little application to date\", suggesting the big questioned was \"when is that money going to be available?\"\n\"I will be revisiting what the current mayor is doing and making sure that money is available asap,\" Mr Parker said.\nSunny Virk, the Liberal Democrat candidate, said VLR was a \"speedy way\" to provide public transport, but said the relationship between the council and the government appeared \"to be where the problem lies\".\n\"A strong mayor will be able to work through those problems and get this project moving again,\" Mr Virk said.\nThe VRL system was branded a \"vanity project\" by Reform UK's candidate Elaine Williams.\nShe said rather than \"blow\" \u00c2\u00a3189m of taxpayers' cash on the scheme, \"Coventry could and should spend a fraction of this amount on increasing the number of buses, security on its buses, remove restrictions and welcome cars back into its city centre\".\nThe Green Party's candidate Siobhan Harper-Nunes said it was \"disappointing\" the government was refusing to fund VLR in full.\nShe said the West Midlands \"gets completely short-changed\" compared with London, adding: \"We need a mayor who will stand up for our fair share of transport funding.\"\nUnder a new funding process, the VLR project has to prove the system works in practice to access more government money from a pot worth \u00c2\u00a340m.\nThe next step is to test the vehicle on a demonstrator track, which the council plans to build in the city centre later this year.\nCoventry city councillor Jim O'Boyle has said he now does not expect VLR to be in public use until at least 2026.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "A mum has been told her ten-year-old daughter's spinal condition is now inoperable after having planned surgery cancelled seven times since September.\nThe curvature of Eva Tennent's spine is now so severe that her mum Jill Lockhart fears she will not survive.\nHer family said three of her operations at Edinburgh's Sick Kids Hospital were postponed due to staff shortages.\nIt comes as BBC News learned that one of Scotland's three paediatric spinal surgeons has been suspended.\nPatients and families under the care of surgeon Chris Adams, who was treating Eva, were told he would no longer be treating them last week - but were not told why by NHS officials.\nThe suspension came a day after Mr Adams met with a BBC journalist and accompanied him on a visit to Eva in hospital, which had been requested by her parents.\nShaye Armour, 13, was also under Mr Adams' care ahead of planned spinal surgery in Edinburgh later this year but the teenager was moved to a hospital in Newcastle on Tuesday for a new surgical assessment.\nBBC News is aware of another case where spinal surgery for a child planned with Mr Adams was postponed at the last minute.\nNHS Lothian said it does not comment on individual members of staff.\nDr Tracey Gillies, the board's medical director, apologised to patients and families affected by rescheduling operations and said the well documented wider pressures on the NHS was partly to blame.\nLast year, a BBC Disclosure investigation into Scotland's NHS revealed claims by Mr Adams that nursing shortages at the Edinburgh Royal Hospital for Children and Young People (RHCYP) were contributing to some children waiting up to three times longer than pre-pandemic for spinal surgery.\nMr Adams and other staff members raised concerns within NHS Lothian about the number of operations being cancelled due to staffing shortages.\nThe problem of bed and staff shortages is impacting all areas of Scotland's NHS with The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health warning that the number of children waiting for some services had more than doubled in the past 11 years .\n'They are telling me it's too late'\nEva suffers from Rett syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects brain development, and has advanced scoliosis that causes her spine to twist and curve to the side.\nThe curvature of her spine was 60.89 degrees in May, 2022, went up to 107.9 degrees last year and is now at 110 degrees, according to Jill.\nHer family say they've been told her condition means it is now inoperable.\nJill told BBC News that Eva had been booked for surgery seven times since September last year, but each time it has been cancelled.\n\"She was deemed operable in September, October and November - and they were only cancelled because of bed and nurse shortages,\" she said.\n\"They have left it so long, and now they are saying it's too late. It feels like my daughter's chances of survival have been sacrificed.\"\nJill said the most recent surgery cancellations were down to Eva's deteriorating respiratory health, which she believes is a result of the delay in operating and the curvature of the ten-year-old's spine putting increased pressure on her internal organs.\nEva was due to undergo surgery on 28 March but this operation has also been cancelled.\n\"We were told last week that the operation could go ahead,\" Jill added.\n\"Now, we're being told she's inoperable and I can't get a proper explanation from the hospital why this situation has changed so quickly.\n\"If Eva had this operation, she could live for another 15 to 30 years with her condition. Without it, she may die.\"\n'They have just left him in limbo'\nShaye Armour, from Greenock, has congenital kyphosis scoliosis, a condition which causes his spine to bend forward.\nThe 13-year-old was being treated at Edinburgh's RHCYP under the care of Mr Adams as part of a series of planned spinal operations this year.\nHis mum Nicole said she was told by NHS Lothian that Mr Adams, who had been Shaye's surgeon for nearly a decade, was no longer available to treat her son but she was not able to find out why from the senior official she spoke to.\nShe said: \"I asked was it personal reasons and he avoided the question. I asked has he been suspended, has he been sacked?\n\"They said he wasn't sacked, so I said has he been suspended then and the answer was no comment which I found pretty weird because Shaye was in the middle of getting his surgeries done.\"\n\"I'm very upset and angry that they have done this to Shaye. They started something and just stopped mid way through, they have just left him in limbo. He's left in the unknown, he has all these questions but has no answers.\n\"If they delay things more or if they make the slightest mistake Shaye will end up paralysed from the neck down.\"\nNicole said Shaye \"was devastated\" by the news as he was very close to Mr Adams, who she described as a \"great man\".\n'Significant pressures'\nDr Gillies, the medical director of NHS Lothian, said: \"We do not comment on individual members of staff.",

We rehabilitate them.\"\nMs Lawlor has launched a crowdfunding appeal in an attempt to save the sanctuary.\nShe said: \"I have used all my reserves so I am trying to get some support just to get me through this summer so that I can get up and running, see what I have got at the end of the summer and put my reserves back.\n\"To actually keep the sanctuary going it literally costs me around \u00c2\u00a370,000 a year. I do not draw a wage from the sanctuary funds.\"\nMs Lawlor said the wet winter brought mud and increased the cost of animal feed and bedding.\nThe former fashion designer is using fleece from her sheep to make rugs - and is also inviting people to attend sheep-walking sessions.\nShe said: \"Without my sheep I just would not have a purpose to be honest with you.\n\"It is my sheep that keep me going, this is more than just a business, it is more than just a sanctuary, they are my family, they are my cloud puppies.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

    "Abandoned allotments in a town will be transformed into a \u00c2\u00a32m wetland to try and reduce the risk of flooding for surrounding homes.\nHalf of the Saltings Allotments in Grimsby has been abandoned since 2001 due to rising groundwater.\nDozens of homes in the area have been affected by flooding.\nA North East Lincolnshire Council report said the water level rise was due to changes in water extraction and heavy rainfall overwhelming the sewers.\nGroundater at the Anglian Water Chelmsford Avenue waterworks is being pumped into the combined sewer network, the report said.\n\"The flooded Saltings area also drains into the same place. and the resulting pressure on the network means that sewers have less capacity to cope with heavy rainfall, so increasing the risk of flooding,\" the report adds.\n\"Over the years the Grimsby sewerage system has not been expanded sufficiently to keep pace with the development and expansion of the town.\n\"Coupled with climate change, which is making the rainfall we experience both more intense and more frequent, we are at a higher risk of flooding than ever.\"\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service said the \u00c2\u00a32m is from Lincolnshire County Council which is using central government funding.\nThe wetland, which will take over the abandoned parts of the allotments site, will be open to the public.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) , and Instagram .

    "The government has set out a series of changes to planned protections for renters in England, after some Conservative MPs raised concerns they would be too burdensome for landlords.\nThe proposals include making tenants commit to a minimum six-month period when renting a property.\nCampaign groups representing renters accused ministers of watering down the legislation to appease landlords.\nBut landlord groups said the changes were fair and balanced.\nOther changes include delaying a ban on no-fault evictions for existing tenancies until an assessment by the justice secretary on the readiness of the court system to deal with repossession claims is published.\nThe Renters (Reform) Bill, which was first introduced to Parliament last May, would abolish no fault-evictions in England, where tenants can be forced to move out with no justification.\nIt would mean that landlords could only evict tenants under certain circumstances, including when they wish to sell the property or when they or a close family member want to move in.\nLast month the BBC revealed ministers were consulting backbench Conservative MPs on watering down their proposed reforms.\nAnd the bill's progress through Parliament has been slow, after around 50 Tory MPs, some of whom are landlords, called for changes.\nThey raised concerns the legislation would see more landlords sell up, reducing the number of rental properties available.\nIn a letter to Tory MPs, Levelling Up Minister Jacob Young said he had listened to concerns from MPs and the sector, and the government would bring forward changes when the draft legislation returns to the House of Commons after the Easter break.\nHe said the bill \"must strike the balance between delivering security for tenants and fairness for landlords\".\nThe proposals would prevent tenants from ending a rental contract in the first six months. Currently the bill allows renters to end a tenancy with two months' notice at any point.\nMr Young said the change would ensure landlords could rely on a letting period that covers the cost of finding tenants and making repairs between tenancies, as well as preventing tenants using rented properties as short-term lets.\nHe added that the government was considering exemptions, such as the death of a tenant, domestic abuse or significant hazards in the property.\nHowever, housing charity Shelter said the move could \"trap renters in hellish conditions\".\nOther proposed changes include:\nPolly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, described the changes as \"cowardly\" and said the government would \"rather betray renters than stand up to a minority of MPs hell-bent on browbeating them into watering down the Renters (Reform) Bill\".\nTom Darling, campaign manager at the Renters' Reform Coalition, said delaying the ban on no-fault evictions for existing tenancies meant most renters would not be impacted until after the next general election.\n\"The government's flagship legislation to help renters is fast becoming a Landlord's Charter,\" he said.\nWithout significant changes he said the legislation \"will hardly be an improvement on the status quo, and in some case it will make things worse\".\nBen Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said ministers now needed to \"crack on\" and pass the bill.\n\"Our focus has been on ensuring that the replacement system works, and is fair, to both tenants and responsible landlords. The changes being proposed would achieve this balance,\" he said.\nHowever, one of the leading Tory MP with concerns about the bill's impact on landlords, Anthony Mangnall, said he would still press for further changes.\nHe told the BBC he was \"pleased with the progress\" but \"there are still some outstanding issues such as fixed-term contracts\".\nCurrently, the bill would abolish fixed-term contracts and replace them with rolling tenancies with no fixed end date. The government says this gives tenants greater security but critics argue it means less certainty for landlords.\nHousing Secretary Michael Gove has promised no-fault evictions will be outlawed in England by the next general election, which must take place by the end of January.\nHowever, the government has already said the ban on no-fault evictions will not be enacted until improvements are made to the court system.\nMPs have warned getting rid of no-fault evictions will increase pressure on the courts, as landlords will need to go through a legal process to regain possession of their properties when they have legitimate grounds to do so.\nLabour said it would immediately abolish no-fault evictions if it won power.\nShadow housing minister Matthew Pennycook said: \"After years of delay, private renters have every right to be furious at the watering down of the vital protections the Tories promised them.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats accused Mr Gove of caving in to Conservative MPs and leaving the party's 2019 manifesto promise to ban no-fault evictions \"in tatters\".",
    "A street artist has said he was shocked to see movie star Gerard Butler visit his mural dedicated to the Scottish actor in Bangor, County Down.\nStreet artist Johnny Hamilton, also known as Jossiepops, painted the mural of the 300 and P.S I Love You Star near Bangor's seafront in Northern Ireland.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Johnny said that he was shocked when he received a message on social media with a picture of Butler kissing his mural.\n\"I couldn't believe it,\" Johnny said.\nHamilton, who is currently in Australia, said that he had previously received a message from Butler, saying that he had seen his street portrait of him on social media and thought it was \"extraordinary\".\nThe Bangor street artist said that Butler also told him that he would love to come down and see it in person, but said he truthfully thought that would never happen.\nHamilton said that when he recently received a picture of his \"movie idol\" actually coming down to see his work in person it was a real \"pinch yourself moment\".\n\"I think it was all down to the power of social media, so many local people were tagging him in photos of the mural and I think that's why he saw it and eventually came down to see it in person,\" he said.\nOperation get Gerard Butler to Bangor\n\"A lot of people asked me why I was painting a picture of a Hollywood actor born in Scotland near Bangor Marina, which let's be honest is a bit strange when you think about it,\" Johnny joked.\n\"The reason to paint his portrait was quite simple, truth be told.\n\"We saw loads of pictures of him in various locations in Northern Ireland, as we know that he was filming here and it was all just in the hope that he would actually visit Bangor.\"\nHamilton said he was a huge fan of the actor's work and said that it was all about giving him a reason to come here.\nButler is currently in Northern Ireland working on the new How to Train Your Dragon animated film, which is due to be released in 2025.\n\"I absolutely loved him in 300 and a lot of his other action films like Olympus Has Fallen,\" Hamilton said.\nHe said that Butler and his family were recently visiting Titanic Belfast and must have decided to make the short road trip to Bangor to see the artwork.\nAustralian road trip stumped star meeting\nThe street artist confessed that the news of Butler coming to see the mural was tinged with a slight bit of sadness because he was not there in person to meet him.\n\"I'm currently in Sydney with my partner as we are travelling across Australia,\" he said.\n\"I would be lying to say I was not a bit gutted that I wasn't there to meet him, but I can't complain too much as I'm near the beautiful Blue Mountains here just outside Sydney.\"\nHamilton said that Northern Ireland, but Bangor in particular, has a fantastic street art scene with so many fantastic artists cropping up.\n\"It's great to see my work being showcased like this and I hope we can see more street art in the city,\" he said.\n\"If you build it they will come, art has the power to bring people together and has the power to bring a Hollywood A lister to our wee city.\"",

    "Amanda Lovett, star of the first series of The Traitors, used to keep her mother's ashes beside her bed. She'd had trouble saying goodbye. But a trip of a lifetime with six strangers gave her the courage to move on.\nAmanda, 56, was catapulted to public attention in the BBC's first series of The Traitors - where she donned her hooded cloak, before being betrayed by a fellow traitor and banished by the faithfuls when her deception was uncovered.\nShe is stepping away from the dark side and into the light - as one of seven well known personalities, of differing faiths and beliefs, to tackle a modern-day pilgrimage for a new BBC Two series. Walking the North Wales Pilgrim's Way, Amanda followed in the footsteps of the ancient pilgrims on a spiritual and personal journey.\nAs a mother of five and grandmother of six, Amanda decided to go on The Traitors and Pilgrimage because \"it was my time to be me\", she says, and \"not have to worry about school runs\".\nAs a practising Catholic, she initially wanted to go on the BBC Two show to question her faith, particularly as she disagreed with its more traditional stance on same-sex relationships. After her appearance on The Traitors, Amanda was warmly embraced by the LGBTQ+ community, who she describes as a family.\n\"I have gone from a traitor to a pilgrim in a year. You couldn't ask for a better student, could you?\" says Amanda.\nBut her journey took her on a different path, as she began to realise there was something she needed to let go of.\nAmanda's childhood was unconventional, particularly her relationship with her mother.\n\"She wasn't a doting, loving mother,\" says Amanda. \"My mum was a functioning alcoholic, which I know now. I didn't know growing up. She came over from Ireland. She couldn't read and write when she met my dad.\n\"My mum was a bingo lady, with the American tan tights and the Benson and Hedges cigarettes.\"\nGrowing up, Amanda wanted a more conventional \"Kellogg's cornflakes advert family\". She wanted to feel \"normality and acceptance\", she says, as her family was so different from her friends and peers at school.\nAmanda's father passed away when she was just 10 years old, and she says she had to take on more adult jobs - like dealing with letters and bills.\nBut when her mother died six years ago, Amanda couldn't bring herself to say goodbye.\n\"I'd looked after her for so many years and I just wasn't ready to let her ashes go,\" she says.\n\"My sister said to me, 'She's got to go back to Ireland, that's where she wanted to go,' and I was being selfish and I said, 'No, she's not going, I want to keep her'.\"\nAmanda would cuddle her mother's ashes when they were in a box, she says, before she placed them in an urn, which sat by the side of her bed.\n\"I'm back with my first husband,\" says Amanda, \"we'd got divorced, but we're back together.\n\"He used to say, really, do you have to keep her by the side of our bed?\"\nIn a pivotal moment on the pilgrimage, Amanda realised it was finally time to say goodbye when a priest, who leads community worship high up in the Welsh hills, spoke about a place where the barrier between Earth and heaven is thinner.\n\"We were taught about a 'thin place', which is when you breathe and you look out at the world and it's almost like the most beautiful thin line between our world and heaven,\" says Amanda.\nSitting on the beach one day, with her fellow pilgrims, she looked up at the sky and saw \"the most beautiful face in the clouds\" she says. She wasn't sure whose face it was, but she knew it meant it was time to let her mother go.\n\"I felt this warmth,\" she says, \"this huge, beautiful golden warmth coming through me.\"\nAfter filming the show, Amanda honoured her mother's wishes and took her back to Ireland and feels at peace now with their relationship.\n\"It was such a release for me, and a happy release, that I almost could feel her flying. I could feel her wings and so the [Pilgrimage] journey that I went in for, really I came out with a totally different journey.\"\nReligious or not, Amanda feels everyone could benefit from the breathing space of a pilgrimage. The time to walk and appreciate the beauty of the natural world, away from the hectic, pressurised pace of life.\n\"We all talk a lot, but I don't think people actually listen anymore, sit and actually listen to one another,\" she says.\nShe enjoyed getting to know her fellow pilgrims and formed a close bond with TV personality Christine McGuinness, whose father battled addiction during her childhood.\nLike many, Amanda was glued to the second series of The Traitors, but felt grumpy watching the first episode.\n\"I was quite protective over my cloak,\" she says. \"I was like, 'Well, who's going to wear my cloak this time, I hope they're worthy of it.\"\nAmanda thinks Harry Clark, a traitor who went on to win the second series, played a \"marvellous game\" and \"had nerves of steel\".\nWhen Harry came face-to-face with his close friend Mollie Pearce at the roundtable, he denied he was a traitor as she questi",

    "The Princess of Wales has announced that she is in the early stages of cancer treatment. Here is Catherine's statement in full:\nI wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you, personally, for all the wonderful messages of support and for your understanding whilst I have been recovering from surgery.\nIt has been an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family, but I've had a fantastic medical team who have taken great care of me, for which I am so grateful.\nIn January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.\nThis of course came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.\nAs you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be ok.\nAs I have said to them; I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal; in my mind, body and spirits.\nHaving William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance too. As is the love, support and kindness that has been shown by so many of you. It means so much to us both.\nWe hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery.\nAt this time, I am also thinking of all those whose lives have been affected by cancer. For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone.",
    "International football star Dani Alves can be conditionally released from jail after he paid bail of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1m (\u00c2\u00a3853,000).\nAlves was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison last month, after a court found him guilty of raping a woman in a Barcelona nightclub in 2022.\nOn Monday, the court in Spain gave the former Barcelona and Brazil footballer permission to leave jail pending his appeal, after he made the stated bail.\nThe 40-year-old has been held in pre-trial detention since January 2023.\n\"We hereby inform you that the deposit of Daniel Alves' bail has been registered in the accounts of the 21st section of the Barcelona Court,\" said a statement.\nHowever, a lawyer for the rape victim has called the decision to allow him to leave jail \"a scandal\".\nSpeaking last week, Ester Garcia said: \"To me, it's a scandal that they let a person who they know can get a million euros in no time walk free.\"\nMs Garcia told RAC1 radio she was \"outraged and dissatisfied\" with the ruling, adding it was \"a justice [system] for the rich\" and that she would lodge an appeal.\nThe player has served about a quarter of his sentence for rape to this point - a fact highlighted by Alves' lawyer when his conditional release was requested earlier this month.\nThe conditions for his release include handing over both his Brazilian and Spanish passports so he is unable to leave Spain. He must also appear before the court on a weekly basis.\nThe court additionally imposed a restraining order, preventing him from approaching the victim.\nThe decision was not unanimous due to a dissenting vote from one of the judges.\nDuring the trial in February, prosecutors said Alves and his friend had bought champagne for three young women before Alves lured one of them to a bathroom in the VIP area of the club.\nThey argued that it was at this point he turned violent, forcing the woman to have sex despite her repeated requests to leave.\nAlves had maintained she could have left \"if she wanted to\".\nHowever, the court found that she did not consent.\nSpanish law was changed recently to enshrine the importance of consent under the so-called \"Only Yes is Yes\" principle.\nIn a statement, the court said there was evidence other than the victim's testimony that proved that she had been raped.\nIt said Alves had \"abruptly grabbed the complainant\" and thrown her to the ground. He had then raped her while preventing her from moving as \"the complainant said no and wanted to leave\", it added.\nThe woman said the rape had caused her \"anguish and terror\", and one of her friends who was with her on the night described how the 23-year-old had cried \"uncontrollably\" after leaving the bathroom.\nAlves changed his testimony on a number of occasions.\nHe first denied knowing his accuser, only to claim later that he had met her in the toilet but that nothing had happened between them.\nHe then changed his version of events again, saying that they had had consensual sex. \"We were both enjoying ourselves,\" he alleged.\nAlves played more than 400 times for Barcelona, winning six league titles and three Champions Leagues across two spells with the club. He was also part of Brazil's 2022 World Cup squad.\nHe has won trophies playing for Sevilla, Juventus and PSG, and is among Brazil's most capped internationals, with 126 appearances.",

Who's going to marry me? How am I going to have children?'\n\"Everything I do, Dawn's always been behind me, same with my kids.\n\"We're a family of adventurers.\"\nBut for the latest adventure it was not so easy to get things in motion. Every company Salim and Shaun approached with the idea told them it was impossible.\n\"When I first started looking into the diving, I contacted a number of different companies,\" Shaun said.\n\"As soon as you mention disabilities, as soon as you mention paralysis there was a lot of barriers put up.\"\nSalim said: \"[They were] silly excuses not to be able to do it, and I think it's because of lack of awareness.\n\"But we're both the type of people that will not accept no as an answer.\"\nThe pair want to set a new world record for the first time a blind person and a paraplegic amputee have dived together.\nWhen Curly, an Egyptian diving instructor at Morecambe Area Divers heard their plan, he agreed to train the pair to complete their challenge.\n\"We want to spread the word that diving is for every body, for every ability,\" Shaun said.\n\"Because we are all equal underwater.\"\nSalim said: \"We can show people, there's nothing to actually stop you [doing something].\n\"Apart from what's in your head.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook , X and Instagram ?

    "Three of the UK's biggest budget fashion brands will change the way they present the environmental impact of their clothes, following action by the competition regulator.\nAsos, Boohoo and George at Asda have signed pledges to use only \"accurate and clear\" claims, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said.\nThe firms said they remained committed to improving sustainability.\nThe move is part of a wider move by the CMA against \"greenwashing\".\nPresenting products as more eco-friendly than they are, without providing further information, is not fair on customers and distorts competition, the regulator said.\nThe CMA also has household products, such as washing up liquid and soaps in its sights. At the end of last year it said it was investigating consumer goods giant Unilever over whether some of its environmental branding was misleading.\n\"What we're asking firms to do is put themselves in the shoes of their shoppers, and see whether that claim is understandable in its own right - is it accompanied by information that makes clear what that means?\" said George Lusty interim executive director for consumer protection and markets at the CMA.\nMany fashion brands market specific ranges as eco-friendly. Asos used to have a \"Responsible edit\" range, Boohoo sells clothes under \"Ready for the Future\", and Asda has \"George for Good\".\nIn future, the criteria for inclusion in these ranges must be \"clearly set out and detail any minimum requirements\", the CMA said.\n\"We really want firms that are investing in their products and their supply chains, who make them greener, to take the credit for that and they deserve to get a competitive edge and win sales,\"  Mr Lusty said.\nOften words like \"eco\" and \"responsible\" and \"sustainable\" were not accompanied by adequate information, he said.\nDr Magdalena Marchowska-Raza, a lecturer in digital marketing at Salford Business School said consumers were rightly sceptical about such eco-marketing claims and would need to see \"proof of progress\" to be convinced.\n\"Addressing this challenge requires more than just surface-level transparency. It calls for a fundamental shift in how companies approach their sustainability goals - not just setting them but actively demonstrating their commitment to achieving them through tangible, measurable actions,\" she said.\nThe CMA's investigation launched in July 2022 did not result in any legal action against the fashion firms. Instead the companies have made a range of voluntary commitments and will have to report back to the CMA on how they are complying with them.\nCommitments include explaining what precise percentage of fibres used are recycled or organic and avoiding using imagery like green leaf logos to suggest a product is more environmentally friendly than it actually is.\nAsos said the voluntary undertakings made by the three brands would \"set a benchmark\" for the industry.\n\"Sharing clear and accurate information on the sustainability credentials of fashion products is crucial to empowering consumers to make fully informed choices,\" Asos said.\nBoohoo said it was pleased that the CMA's investigation had not resulted in any legal action against the firm, adding that the group had \"not intentionally misled customers\".\nThe firm's chief executive John Lyttle, said: \"We remain committed to working with others to find collective solutions to the shared challenges of sustainability within the fashion industry.\"\nAn Asda spokesperson said the company was pleased to have mutually agreed the voluntary undertakings.\n\"We support any measures aimed at improving consumers' understanding of environmental claims,\" they said.\nThe CMA also published an open letter to the fashion industry urging other firms to review their own environmental claims and ensure they comply with consumer protection laws.\nGeraint Lloyd-Taylor at law firm Lewis Silkin said the voluntary agreement would be a relief to the firms involved, whilst establishing clearer guidelines for the future.\n\"There are some broad lessons here for all companies in all sectors, such as the fact the CMA has singled out the use of leafy green images as being problematic, because they are likely to exaggerate the environmental benefits of the product or ranges being promoted,\" he said.\nHowever the CMA was likely to be less accommodating in future if greenwashing rules were being breached, he added, highlighting new powers the CMA is about to get, allowing it to impose financial penalties of up to 10% of a firm's annual global turnover.",
    "A lucrative devolution deal for three boroughs in the north west of England \"must be right\" before it is agreed, a report has said.\nWarrington Borough Council's Labour group voted in 2017 for the town to team up with two other Cheshire councils to seek devolved powers.\nDiscussions with the government over a \"county deal\" have taken place, but there is yet to be an agreement.\nThe report will come before councillors at a committee meeting next month.\nA deal could be reportedly worth at least \u00c2\u00a330m a year to the county.\nAny arrangement would see the government delegate major powers to Warrington, Cheshire East, and Chester and Cheshire West councils, and could see additional funding for between 10 and 25 years, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service .\n'Fixed menu approach'\nA update on the negotiations will come before Warrington's Supporting the Local Economy policy committee on 3 April.\nA report published ahead of the meeting said: \"Any devolution deal must be right for Cheshire and Warrington.

    "Salt bricks and sweeping mud walls - as recently showcased by some African architects - may be the building blocks for innovative designs of the future.\nSuch ideas were explored by Nigerian architect Tosin Oshinowo in a major exhibition she recently curated in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nShe wanted to look at how regions such as Africa are able to function with scarce resources.\n\"I think ultimately the big elephant in the room for most of us is climate change,\" Ms Oshinowo told the BBC about the show The Beauty of Impermanence: An Architecture of Adaptability.\nDesigners from 26 countries were invited to Sharjah to come up with works to address the issue of scarcity.\nFor Ethiopian designer Miriam Hillawi Abraham, this meant building what looked like a church out of salt.\nShe called the work Museum of Artifice - and it was a nod to Ethiopia's famous rock-hewn churches in Lalibela as well as the remote northern village of Dallol.\nThis is in the Danakil Depression, more than 330ft (100m) below sea level, and arguably the hottest place on Earth.\nLargely abandoned now, Dallol still has single-storey buildings made out of blocks cut from the nearby salt lakes.\nMs Miriam's structure, made from pink Himalayan salt, will erode without regular maintenance.\n\"It does raise the question: 'What can we learn from these locations?'\" Ms Oshinowo said.\nAnother work at the Sharjah Architecture Triennial was by Hive Earth Studio, a Ghanaian architecture firm that specialises in compressing locally sourced earth to form walls.\nIt was called Eta'dan, meaning \"mud wall\" in Ghana's Fante language - and the soil was sourced in the UAE to reduce the environmental impact of transporting materials.\nHive Earth's ethos is to learn from the past to create buildings for the present, seeking sustainability and a pleasing aesthetic.\nMs Oshinowo said the design team, who had been at the forefront of exploring the technology of rammed earth in West Africa, used rocks from the UAE to achieve the layering and strength required for the walls.\n\"Through material exploration they were able to transfer the skills of rammed earth,\" she said.\n\"There was a lot of testing to see how it would work in this environment, especially where you have a lot of sand.\n\"It just shows you what the possibilities are. If we think of things differently, we really can change the way we build and the way we design our buildings.\"\nGhana-based design duo Dominique Petit-Fr\u00c3\u00a8re and Emil Grip tackled the potential of unfinished building projects - prevalent in West Africa.\nKnown as Limbo Accra, the pair transformed a derelict shopping mall into an inviting space.\nThey worked in collaboration with Ivorian fashion label Super Yaya to artfully drape strips of white calico cotton fabric across the entrance.\nThe work, Super Limbo, was also a nod to Bedouin culture and their desert tents.\n\"We were inspired to connect our experiences of navigating the remains of unfinished architecture in West Africa with a Middle Eastern setting,\" Ms Petit-Fr\u00c3\u00a8re told the BBC.\nArchitects Papa Omotayo and Eve Nnaji, based in the Nigerian city of Lagos, took inspiration from the potted plants and bird cages they spotted being tended by mechanics in an industrial area of Sharjah.\nTheir three-storey structure We Rest at the Birds Nest was made from scaffolding and organic waste, providing a sanctuary for both birds and workers.\nMetal steps led up to platforms decorated with vegetation, while rows of 2,000 biodegradable cardboard nests lined an atrium that descended from the open rooftop to the ground. Passageway windows allowed a view into the birds' haven.\n\"As architects we tend to stay focused on people, but we share this planet,\" Ms Oshinowo said.\n\"When we start to think about accommodating other species, it's also a very powerful narrative.\"\nMs Oshinowo hopes the exhibition gave those attending an opportunity to pause and reflect on sustainability and design.\nAnd the exhibits from Africa, a continent disproportionately affected by the climate crisis, showed how designers were starting to work in \"better balance with ecology\".\nImages subject to copyright.\nYou may also be interested in:",
    "Perth Museum opens its doors this weekend with the Stone of Destiny as its centrepiece, following a \u00c2\u00a327m redevelopment of the former city hall.\nThe ancient symbol of Scotland's monarchy, was seized by King Edward I of England in the late 13th Century and remained in England for 700 years.\nIt was returned to Scotland in 1996.\nWhile the star attraction has garnered the most attention, the museum aims to put Perth and Kinross \"at the centre of Scotland's story\".\nIts collection includes the 3,000 year-old Carpow Logboat , which was excavated from the River Tay in 2006.\nThe museum breathes new life into a building that was almost demolished.\nCity Hall, which had hosted gigs by The Kinks, Cream, and The Who in the 1960s, became redundant as an arts venue after Perth Concert Hall was completed in 2005.\nThe council originally voted to demolish the listed building to make way for a new city square, but later changed its mind.\nProposals for the building included converting it into a luxury hotel or a food hall.\nBut a proposal was put forward in 2016 to redevelop the building into a museum as a new home for the Stone of Destiny, also known as the Stone of Scone.\nThe Stone of Destiny formed part of the coronation chair on which kings and queens were crowned - most recently during the coronation of King Charles last year.\nIt was returned for permanent display in Scotland in 1996 and placed in Edinburgh Castle.\nAlmost three decades later, under tight security, it has moved to its new home in Perth. Its backdrop is an animated presentation on its chequered history and return to Perthshire after 700 years.\nCulture Perth and Kinross exhibitions manager JP Reid said: \"Interestingly, it's a live ceremonial object, so it's back down for coronations and other ceremonial use.\n\"So, inevitably, given its back history of numerous removals in the past, the security profile is extremely high for the building.\n\"The new building itself has effectively been built around the security provision for the stone.\"\nThe stone sits alongside more than 3,000 local objects, spanning 10,000 years.\nMr Reid said: \"This collection has some outstanding material that is unique in the world.\n\"We've got a slashed silk doublet, which is made in the 1620s and is in incredible condition - it looks brand new.\n\"We also have outstanding carved Pictish crosses, which are being interpreted in new ways for the first time.\"\nMr Reid said the building was the perfect place to tell the story of the local area.\nHe said: \"When we first started working on the site it had been empty for 15 years.\n\"But we really recognised how prominent and important this building was in the lives and story of Perth and Kinross.\n\"It's really exciting to see it come back to life.\"\nThe museum is funded by a \u00c2\u00a317m investment from Perth and Kinross Council and \u00c2\u00a310m from Tay Cities Deal funding from the UK government.\nIn December 2020, then First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the bid for the Stone of Destiny to move to Perth had been approved by Queen Elizabeth II.\nConstruction work began in early 2021 and was completed in August last year.\nEntry to the museum is free but advance booking is required to see the Stone of Destiny, although limited on-the-day tickets will be available.\nCulture Perth and Kinross's chief executive Helen Smout said the museum was probably the biggest cultural project Perth had seen in two centuries.\nShe said: \"I think there was recognition that Perth needed to have more on offer to perform as well as it could.\n\"A lot of tourists bypassed Perth and went straight for the beautiful scenery, and people who did come here didn't necessarily spend very long.\"\nI think I may have found the perfect-sized museum.\nPerth Museum is packed full of eclectic treasures that tell the story of Perth and Kinross and wider Scotland and its identity through the ages.\nIt's large enough to do that story justice and small enough that you can view the entire collection without getting museum-fatigue.\nThe immersive experience they've created around the Stone of Destiny is a real highlight and helps reflect an object of great historical significance even today (and is back in Perth after more than 700 years).\nBut who wouldn't also want to see a sword belonging to Bonnie Prince Charlie (never on public display before), a cast of the heaviest British rod-caught salmon (by a Miss Ballantine in 1922) or a bronze age logboat preserved in the peaty soil of the area for centuries?\nThere's much more.\nAnd next to a section on the Georgians - with some beautiful jewellery and clothing - is a cabinet containing the remains of a child's tiny battered leather shoe.\nIt's believed to belong to a family forced from their home by the landowner, the Duke of Atholl, in the late 18th or early 19th century as part of the Highland clearances.\nThis new museum's centrepiece is the Stone of Destiny - and no doubt will be the draw for many (the pre-bookable tickets to see it on the opening weekend sold out in ",
    "Michael Gove has been found to have breached Commons rules by failing to register hospitality at three football matches on time.\nThe levelling up secretary failed to declare the VIP tickets within the 28 days required, Parliament's standards commissioner ruled .\nThe commissioner also found he had failed to register an unpaid role at a charity.\nMr Gove apologised for the omissions, which he said were a \"mistake\".\nThe commissioner, Daniel Greenberg, allowed him to update his registered interests without a punishment, adding they were \"minor\".\nMr Greenberg opened an investigation last month after the Guardian reported Mr Gove failed to register hospitality he received at a Queens Park Rangers game he attended with Conservative donor David Meller in August 2021.\nMr Gove wrote to the commissioner to apologise for the \"error\" in not registering the two tickets for him and his son.\nAfter checking his diary, he also admitted he had failed to register tickets for him and his son at two other QPR games, in January 2020 and January 2022.\nHe said they were all in the box of club chairman Amit Bhatia, which are not normally put on sale to supporters but were valued by QPR at \u00c2\u00a3460, \u00c2\u00a3542, and \u00c2\u00a3460 plus VAT for each pair of tickets.\nHe added that on each occasion he was the guest of QPR, the west London club where he had previously been a season-ticket holder.\n'Significantly late'\nHe also admitted he had failed to disclose in his Commons register an unpaid role he holds as a governor of the Ditchley Foundation.\nThe foundation, based at Ditchley Park country house in Oxfordshire, was set up to promote the ties between the US and Europe and hosts events attended by \"decision makers and experts\".\nMr Gove has now added the tickets, and the position, to his parliamentary register of financial interests.\nIn a letter, Mr Greenberg said Mr Gove would face no sanction, adding: \"Although all four interests have been registered significantly late, I am satisfied that they can all be fairly described as minor in nature\".\nMr Gove accepted the ruling, describing it as a \"fair and reasonable response to my failure\".",

    "Some of the UK's rarest birds are preparing to breed in Epping Forest, with areas roped off from walkers.\nSkylarks, Nightjars and Dartford Warblers all nest on the ground or in low bushes, which leaves them vulnerable to being disturbed.\nThe Skylarks on Wanstead Flats are the closest returning population of ground-nesting birds to central London, a City of London committee said.\nWalkers are also asked to make sure their dogs are under control.\nWanstead Flats is a large area of open grassland in the south of the forest and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).\nSkylarks, Nightjars and Dartford Warblers\nThe Skylark is a small brown bird, larger than a sparrow but smaller than a starling.\nIt is streaky brown with a small crest - which can be raised when the bird is excited or alarmed - and a white-sided tail.\nThe wings also have a white rear edge, which is visible in flight.\nIt is known for its display flight, vertically up in the air. Recent and dramatic population declines make it a red list species .\nNightjars are nocturnal and can be seen hunting for food at dusk and dawn.\nThey have pointed wings and long tails, similar to a Kestrel.\nThey have a supernatural reputation thanks to their silent flight and their mythical ability to steal milk from goats - their Latin name Caprimulgus translates as goatsucker.\nThe Dartford Warbler's population crashed to just a few pairs in the 1960s, but has gradually recovered since then.\nIt will perch on top of a stem to sing, but is more often seen as a small flying shape bobbing between bushes.\nThe bird was originally known by its country name, the Furze Wren. It was formally \"discovered\" in Bexley - when two were shot on the common and given to a naturalist, John Latham.\nDr Latham ruffled the feathers of the locals by registering the species not after Bexley but after Dartford, where he had his medical practice.\nThere is still a Furze Wren in Bexleyheath, a Wetherspoon pub.\nChairman of the Epping Forest and Commons Committee, Ben Murphy, said of the temporary cordons: \"Some people may think these [cordoning off] measures go too far - but the reality is that these birds play a critical role in protecting the forest and maintaining a balanced ecosystem.\n\"They are pest controllers, pollinators and seed dispersers.\n'Incredibly promising'\n\"We want everyone to enjoy the abundance of nature found in 'the green lungs of London', which is why we are urging visitors to respect these birds by staying out of the clearly defined areas.\"\nIf adult birds are scared from nests, it leaves any chicks vulnerable - and accidental trampling can destroy the habitat in just one step.\nMr Murphy added: \"The protective measures we put in place last year resulted in at least four young larks fledging.\n\"There were 11 skylarks there at the end of last season and we have seen seven individuals so far, which is incredibly promising.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

    "Conservative Susan Hall has launched her mayoral election campaign with a promise to \"listen to Londoners\".\nOn Sunday in Uxbridge, the Tory hopeful accused London Mayor Sadiq Khan of having \"ignored\" voters in the capital.\nShe said she would focus on what she described as the \"unfair\" expansion of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez).\nIn response, incumbent London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned a Conservative mayor would \"cancel\" his policies.\nThe mayoral election on 2 May will use the first past the post system, rather than the former Supplementary Vote system.\nMr Khan is currently seeking an unprecedented third term in office and launched his election campaign last week with a pledge to build 40,000 new council homes by the end of the decade.\nRecent polling by Savanta suggests Ms Hall is languishing behind Mr Khan by about 26 points, despite the public being split on the mayor's record in office.\nThe poll showed 51% of voters saying they would back Mr Khan against 27% who said they would vote for Ms Hall, with younger voters and those who are Asian or black overwhelmingly backing the mayor.\nMs Hall's key pledges include scrapping the expansion of the Ulez scheme on her first day in office and reopening the London Plan in an attempt to boost housebuilding.\nThe London Plan is also in Mr Khan's development strategy.\nShe would also encourage the removal of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs), and \"remove unnecessary 20mph zones on main TfL-controlled roads\" if elected.\nSpeaking on the day of her campaign launch Ms Hall said: \"Sadiq Khan has ignored Londoners for eight years. If he wins a third term, that would be giving him permission to ignore us again.\n\"Crime has spiralled out of control after he shut police stations and failed to recruit police, rents have spiked because he has not built the affordable family homes Londoners deserve, and he has imposed his unfair Ulez expansion tax, hitting the lowest earners the hardest.\n\"I am listening to Londoners. My priorities are Londoners' priorities and as mayor I will recruit more police, build more affordable homes and scrap the Ulez expansion on day one.\"\nSpeaking in central London earlier on Monday, Mr Khan branded the May election as a \"clear two-horse race\" between himself and the Conservative candidate.\nHe claimed Ms Hall would \"cancel\" several of his flagship policies including TfL fare freezes, free school meals, action on cleaner air and progress on police reform.\nThe mayor said: \"The choice on 2 May is quite clear: Me, who's been delivering a fairer, safer, greener, more affordable London, or the Tories who would cancel that.\"\nMr Khan emphasised the possibility of \"real transformation\" for the capital if he was re-elected alongside a Labour government.\nHe added: \"There's a possibility of a Labour mayor and a Labour government working together, rather than rowing against the tide of a Tory government.\n\"We'd have the winds of a Labour government at our back, bringing about real transformation in London.\"\nMs Hall's campaign spokesman said Mr Khan's comments were a \"complete distortion of the truth\".\nMr Khan has promised not to expand the Ulez scheme further if he returns to the role after May's election.\nThe zone was widened last August to cover the whole of Greater London, a controversial move overseen by the London mayor.\nOn the same day as Ms Hall's campaign launch, Mr Khan ruled out increasing the charge if he was re-elected and said there would be no changes to vehicle restrictions.\nMeanwhile on Monday, Age UK held a hustings, campaigning for older Londoners' interests ahead of the election.\nThe only candidate who turned up was the Green Party's Zoe Garbett with the rest of the main party candidates sending stand-ins.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , X and Instagram .

Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said: \"As young people's social engagement switched to the online environment during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, so it appears that perpetration and experience of cyberbullying increased.\n\"Focusing on virtual types of peer violence is now an urgent priority to safeguard the health and wellbeing of populations of adolescents and young people, and cyberbullying must be viewed as a major issue for societies.\n\"With young people spending up to six hours online every single day, even small changes in the rates of bullying and violence can have profound implications for the health and wellbeing of thousands.\n\"This is both a health and a human rights issue, and we must step up to protect our children from violence and harm, both offline and online.\"\n'A real concern'\nSarah Hannafin, senior policy adviser for school leaders' union NAHT, said: \"These figures showing an increase in cyberbullying among children are a real concern, and while schools work hard to help keep pupils safe, online bullying can take place anywhere, at any time.\n\"Schools alone cannot tackle the issue and the government must ensure the Online Safety Act is implemented swiftly and properly enforced, while social media platforms must do much more to provide a safe online environment.\"\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"The Online Safety Act will make the UK the safest place in the world for children to be online, requiring companies to take robust action to protect children from harmful content, illegal activity, and abuse - including keeping children safe from bullying.\n\"Companies that do not comply with the new can face fines of up to 10% of their global annual revenue, potentially up to billions of pounds.\"",
    "Rishi Sunak is facing criticism after a major Conservative Party donor was given a knighthood.\nBusinessman Mohamed Mansour, a senior treasurer for the party, has been honoured for his business, charity and political service.\nLast year he gave \u00c2\u00a35m, at the time the party's biggest donation since 2001.\nLabour has accused the prime minister of showing \"blatant disrespect for the office he should feel privileged to hold\".\nSir Mohamed was given a knighthood alongside Farming Minister Mark Spencer and Shipley's Conservative MP Philip Davies, as well as damehoods for former ministers Tracey Crouch and Harriett Baldwin.\nMr Sunak recommended the honours to the King.\nTypically lists of people who have received honours are published at New Year and on the King's official birthday in June.\nHowever, the announcement, which also included honours for film director Christopher Nolan and his wife, film producer Emma Thomas , came at the start of the Parliamentary recess.\nThe Egyptian-born business tycoon, who has British citizenship, is the chairman of the Mansour Group and founded the London-based investment firm Man Capital.\nSir Mohamed was once a politician in Egypt, where he served as a transport minister from 2006 to 2009 under Hosni Mubarak, the late Egyptian president who stood down in 2011 during the Arab Spring.\nHe has been honoured for his services to business, charity and political service.\nLabour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said: \"This is either the arrogant act of an entitled man who's stopped caring what the public thinks, or the demob-happy self-indulgence of someone who doesn't expect to be prime minister much longer.\n\"Either way, it shows a blatant disrespect for the office he should feel privileged to hold.\"\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Sunak has once again shown just how out of touch he is by handing out gongs to donors bankrolling his party who have plunged the economy into a recession.\"\nReform UK leader Richard Tice accused the Tories of \"toxic\" cronyism.\n\"[The] whole thing stinks like rotting fish,\" he wrote on X.\nA Number 10 source pointed to Sir Mohamed's \"extensive public and charity service\", including his support for the Prince's Foundation, now the King's Foundation.\nSir Mark, who is the MP for Sherwood, has been a minister since 2022.\nSir Philip, who has been an MP since 2005, has served on numerous parliamentary committees.\nHis wife, Esther McVey, was appointed to the cabinet last year, in a role dubbed \"minister for common sense\".\nSir Philip said he was \"somewhat flabbergasted\" by the news of his honour, adding \"it feels very surreal\".\nDame Tracey, who represents Chatham and Aylesford, is a former sports minister - who led a review of football governance in the wake of proposals for a breakaway European Super League .\nShe is among 63 Tory MPs who have said they will stand down at the next election, after she recovered from breast cancer.\nWest Worcestershire MP Dame Harriet is a former Foreign Office minister and currently chairs the Commons Treasury Committee.\nMeanwhile Democratic Unionist Party MP Gregory Campbell has also been made a CBE.\nThe MP for East Londonderry is the DUP's spokesman for international development.",
    "A man has been arrested in connection with the death of Gogglebox star George Gilbey after the 40-year-old died in a fall at work.\nEssex Police was called to Shoeburyness near Southend-on-Sea on Wednesday after reports that a man working at height had fallen.\nGilbey, a self-employed electrician, died at the scene.\nThe force said it had arrested a man in his 40s on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.\n\"This is a joint investigation with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and our inquiries are ongoing,\" a spokesperson added.\nThe incident happened at EGL Homecare, a manufacturing business in Campfield Road, where a single bouquet of flowers could be seen beside entrance gates on Thursday morning.\nGilbey, along with his mum and step dad, featured in eight series of Channel 4's Gogglebox, between 2013 and 2018, and he also appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in 2014.\nThe reality star appeared on the then-Channel 5 contest alongside celebrities including The Hills star Stephanie Pratt and American actor Gary Busey, who won the series.\nC4 Gogglebox wrote on its official X account: \"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Linda, and George's family and friends at this very sad time.\"\nGilbey ran his own company WindG Ltd in Clacton-on-Sea, according to LinkedIn\nFormer Geordie Shore cast member Ricci Guarnaccio, who appeared in Celebrity Big Brother with Gilbey, said he spoke to his friend only last week.\n\"You are well and truly going to be missed my friend,\" he wrote on X.\n\"Always lit up the room, cared for others and the memories we made I'll cherish forever.\"\nRadio presenter Ian Wyatt spoke to Gilbey on several occasions at events and told BBC Essex: \"He was very, very approachable, very, very likeable - you'd have his mobile number which you could call at any time... he wasn't precious at all about that sort of thing.\"\nA spokesperson for the HSE said: \"We are aware of the incident and working with Essex Police in their investigation.\"\nPolice said the arrested man was from the Witham area of Essex and further updates would be announced \"proactively\".\nEGL Homecare declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Wales fans were left distraught after their team's agonising penalty defeat to Poland saw them miss out on qualification for Euro 2024.\nAfter a goalless 120 minutes, Daniel James missed the only spot-kick , with Poland converting all five.\nPoland join Netherlands, Austria and France in Group D at this year's Euros in Germany while Wales will watch from home and wonder what could have been.\n\"I feel absolutely terrible,\" said Matthew Davies, 23, from Ammanford.\n\"Me and my mates have gone to every single game,\" he told the BBC outside Cardiff City Stadium after the game.\n\"We've never had the experience of going to penalties before. It's a young squad in transition so I didn't back us really. Neither team dominated the game, I didn't think.\"\nMatthew was planning on going to \"every single game\" in Germany and said Tuesday night's defeat had ruined his summer plans.\nAfter the devastation of the penalty shootout, a very subdued sea of bucket hats streamed out of the stadium.\nThere was a distant chant of \"Wales, Wales, Wales\" from those supporters who stayed to clap the players off. Others were already hatching new plans for the summer, their planned trips to Germany in tatters.\nBilly Jackson, 31, from Newbridge, said he was \"devastated\" by the defeat: \"It was so close, wasn't it. So close but not to be.\n\"I thought they played very, very well. It was a great game to watch, and Poland played very well too.\"\nWhile admitting the defeat was \"heartbreaking\", he said he was proud of his team.\n\"The atmosphere is always brilliant here. Next time,\" he said.\nSaffron Rennison, 22, from Cardiff, said she was \"absolutely devastated\".\n\"I for sure thought a goal was coming. I thought we had it. To lose 5-4 on penalties, it was tough,\" she said.\n\"Seeing what Rob Page has done with the team these past two games, we looked like a really strong, promising side.\"\nQuestions over Page's future\nEx-Wales striker John Hartson also gave his reaction after the game, saying \"this current crop of Welsh players have so many good years ahead of them\".\nHe also raised questions about the future of Wales manager Robert Page.\n\"Do you stick with Page or do you bring a manager that's managed at the top level with more experience? Questions must be asked,\" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter .\nHe also said James had been \"brave\" to step up and take the penalty.\n\"The boy will be devastated. He needs to be looked after now, not thrown to the lions. Look after your own,\" he said.\nAnother fan leaving the ground, Will Morris, 18, also called for Page to be sacked.\n\"He didn't show any passion. It was against a poor Poland team. It was a winnable game,\" he said.",
    "Donald Trump appears to be scrambling for funds to pay a $464m (\u00c2\u00a3365m) fraud fine. Could the stock market ride to his rescue?\nTrump Media, which runs the social media platform Truth Social, is poised to become a publicly listed company, after a majority of shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp voted on Friday to acquire it.\nMr Trump is due to have a stake of at least 58% in the merged company, worth nearly $3bn at Digital World's current share prices.\nIt's an astonishing potential windfall for Mr Trump in exchange for a business whose own auditor warned last year it was at risk of failure.\nNever mind the many red flags associated with the deal, including unresolved lawsuits from former business partners. There's also an $18m settlement that Digital World agreed to pay last year to resolve fraud charges over how the merger plan came together.\nShares in Digital World dropped more than 13% on Friday after the approval, ending the day at $36.94.\nBackers of Digital World - the vast majority of whom are individual investors instead of Wall Street firms, many apparently Trump loyalists - seemed unfazed.\n\"This is just the start,\" Chad Nedohin, a deal supporter, said on his show DWAC Live on the video platform Rumble after the approval was announced.  \"There's no reason to freak out.\"\nDigital World, or DWAC (pronounced D-whack), is what is known as a SPAC, or a shell business created expressly to buy another firm and take it public.\nThe company will now be renamed Trump Media & Technology Group and could start trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker DJT as soon as next week.\nThe deal is unlikely to immediately resolve Mr Trump's most pressing financial issues, such as his New York fraud penalty.\nThe former president is barred from selling or transferring his shares for at least six months - though the new company could grant him an exemption.\nMr Trump could also try to get a loan, backed by the value of the shares. But in this case, analysts said a bank would probably lend him significantly less than the shares are worth on paper, given the potential risks of the business.\nThat hasn't stopped some of his supporters hoping their backing will help.\nMr Nedohin, who describes himself on his website as a Canadian \"worship leader\" and goes by Captain DWAC on Truth Social, declined to be interviewed.\nBut on his show this week he urged investors to approve the deal, speculating it could help the former president in his legal battles.\n\"If the merger is complete Friday at 10am and Trump all of a sudden has... shares of DJT that's worth three, four, five $10bn, who knows? He could easily leverage that to get a loan,\" he said.\nHe added: \"This is putting your money where your mouth is for free speech, to save your country, potentially losing it all.\"\nThe risk that Digital World shareholders will lose money on their investment is significant, according to analysts.\nShare prices are down from the highs they reached after plans to purchase Trump Media were announced in 2021.\nBut even after Friday's slide, they still imply Trump Media has a value of almost $5bn, which is a lot given it brought in just $3.3m in revenue in the first nine months of last year and lost nearly $50m.\nThe merger will provide an influx of more than $200m in cash to Trump Media, which it could use for growth and expansion.\nBut for now Truth Social, which launched to the general public in 2022, branding itself as an alternative to major social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, remains small.\nIt claims about 8.9 million sign-ups and in regulatory filings Trump Media warns prospective investors that it does not track metrics like user growth or engagement that could give them a sense of its operations. And it says it has little intention of doing so.\nOutside firms estimate Truth Social received about five million visits in February. By comparison, Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, and recently valued by one investor at about $14bn, received more than 100 million visits.\nAnalysts said Digital World was a prime example of a \"meme stock\", in which the share price is divorced from a company's fundamentals - and near-destined to fall, eventually.\n\"With Trump Media, I expect that it will collapse but whether it's going to occur a week from now or two years from now and how rapidly... those things are really difficult to predict,\" said University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter, who tracks public listings.\nMarco Iachini, senior vice-president of research at Vanda Securities, said individual investors piled into Digital World stock after the Trump deal was announced, and again in January, after he won the Iowa primary.\nAhead of the vote this week, he said there had been less activity, a sign that professional firms might be the ones driving the trading.\nWhatever is motivating buyers, Mr Trump, whose main contributions to Trump Media have been his name and posts on the platform, appears poised to be the top beneficiary.\n\"It's an en",
    "Russia and China have blocked a US draft resolution put to the UN which for the first time called for a ceasefire and hostage releases in Gaza.\nWhile there have been previous attempts by other countries to call for a ceasefire, the US text marked a hardening of its stance towards Israel.\nBut Russia and China used their veto. Moscow called the text \"hypocritical\".\nThe move by the US, Israel's key ally, comes at a time of growing tensions between them.\nWashington has made clear that it expects Israel to lessen the intensity of its offensive in Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry says at least 31,988 people - mainly women and children - have been killed since the war began on 7 October.\nIt has also said it would not support an Israeli attack on the city of Rafah without a plan to protect civilians there, and has urged Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.\nIsrael's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said that Israel will go ahead with a planned ground assault on Rafah, even without the support of its key ally.\nThe US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, in Tel Aviv for talks, said such an operation was not the answer.\n\"It risks killing more civilians, it risks wreaking greater havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance, it risks further isolating Israel around the world and jeopardising this long-term security and standing,\" he said.\nThe US - one of five permanent members of the Security Council with the power of veto - has previously blocked resolutions calling for a ceasefire, saying such a move would be wrong while delicate negotiations for a truce and hostage releases were continuing between Israel and Hamas.\nBut on Friday it publicly changed its position, in a carefully-worded draft.\n\"The Security Council,\" the text read, \"determines the imperative of an immediate and sustained ceasefire\", adding \"and towards that end unequivocally supports ongoing international diplomatic efforts to secure such a ceasefire in connection with the release of all remaining hostages\".\nIn doing so, the US linked its support for a ceasefire to the release of the Israeli hostages - 253 - held by Hamas.\nAlthough Russia and China vetoed the draft, 11 countries on the 15-member council voted in favour of it. Algeria voted against it and Guyana abstained.\nEarly on Saturday, a vote on a new text calling for a ceasefire was postponed until Monday, diplomats told the AFP and Reuters news agencies.\nBefore Friday's vote, Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, criticised the text as \"exceedingly politicised\", accusing it of doing nothing to avert Israel's planned assault on Rafah.\nMore than half of Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians are sheltering in the southern city, where Israel says Hamas leaders are hiding and Hamas battalions still operate.\nThe US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, called Russia and China's action \"deeply, deeply cynical\".\n\"Russia and China simply did not want to vote for a resolution that was penned by the United States, because it would rather see us fail than see this Council succeed,\" she said.\nSpeaking after talks with Mr Netanyahu, Mr Blinken said the US was trying to show the international community \"a sense of urgency\".\nA ceasefire tied to the release of hostages, he said, was \"something that everyone, including the countries that veto the resolution should have been able to get behind\".\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said his country would now work on an alternative resolution.\n\"What's important to note is that the United States has changed its position, and shown its will to defend, very clearly now, a ceasefire,\" Mr Macron said.\n\"For a long time, the Americans were reticent. That reticence is now gone.\"",

    "A UK flag maker has created its own version of the US flag in response to Nike's colourful interpretation of the St George's Cross on England's new kit.\nA row over the 2024 home kit erupted on Thursday, with politicians and sports figures weighing in on the topic.\nNike said its design was to celebrate the 1966 World Cup team, adding it was \"never our intention to offend\".\nLincolnshire-based Newton Newton Flags Ltd suggested Nike leave \"the flags to us\" and stick to ticks on plimsolls.\nManufacturer Nike has changed the cross of St George, with its horizontal bar now a combination of blues and purples rather than the red of the original flag.\nTo be be worn by England's men's, women's and para teams, Nike described it as \"a playful interpretation\" and an attempt to \"unite and inspire\".\nNewton Newton company director Tracy Turner said Nike \"should have stuck to red and white\".\nShe said the mocked-up image of the American flag was intended to be \"very tongue-in-cheek\", but conveyed a serious message.\nPeople in the US would rightly not tolerate \"anyone messing with their flag\", and the same courtesy should be extended to the cross of St George, she said.\n\"It's been like that for hundreds of years,\" she added.\nMs Turner said her late father, who founded the firm in 1975, had always said \"nothing will stir up emotion more than a flag\".\nThe new design of the cross has attracted criticism from fans , along with the prime minister and opposition leader.\nFormer England goalkeeper Peter Shilton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he does not agree with the changes, saying \"I'm a traditionalist\".\nHowever, England midfielder Declan Rice and Lionesses striker Alessia Russo have both rated the new kit as 10 out of 10.\nSt George's Day: Who was England's patron saint?\nNike said the shirt, launched ahead of Euro 2024, includes \"a playful update to the cross of St George\" which \"appears on the collar to unite and inspire\".\nA Nike spokesperson told media outlets: \"The England 2024 Home kit disrupts history with a modern take on a classic,\" inspired by the training kit worn by England's 1966 World Cup winners.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "Schoolboys credited with helping people escape from the attack on the Crocus City Hall music venue have been hailed as heroes in the Russian media.\nIslam Khalilov, 15, and Artyom Donskoy, 14, were working as cloakroom attendants when the attack began.\nTogether with other employees, they reportedly directed people fleeing away from dead ends and towards the exits.\nOn Monday, the boys were awarded medals for bravery in a ceremony by Russia's commissioner for children's rights.\n\"They modestly say they did what they had to do,\" Maria Lvova-Belova said.\nMrs Lvova-Belova is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes over claims of unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia.\nIslam, whose family are immigrants to Russia from the Central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan, had been working at Crocus City Hall for about a year. He told local reporters that when the attack began, he thought \"some company\" was doing \"noisy\" repair work in the hall.\nHe said he understood something was wrong when he saw people running.\nVideo seemingly from the incident appears to show Islam directing people fleeing in a corridor.\nThe BBC has not verified the footage and has not been able to independently corroborate the claims made in the Russian media about the event.\nOn 22 March, four gunmen stormed the Crocus City Hall in Krasnogorsk, a northern Moscow suburb, and began firing on some of the estimated 6,000 people who were attending a rock concert before setting fire to the venue.\nAt least 137 people were killed during the attack, according to authorities.\nFour citizens of Tajikistan accused of being the gunmen - named as Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov - appeared in court on Sunday. All showed signs of severe torture.\nReports of xenophobic acts by individual people and authorities in Russia aimed against Central Asians have increased since the incident.\nThere are currently more than 10 million migrant workers from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan in Russia.\nSome citizens of Kyrgyzstan have been stuck in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport for two days after being denied entry to Russia, broadcaster RFE/RL reported.\nA source in the Russian foreign ministry told state news agency RIA that official measures to \"control migrants\" could increase after the attacks.\nRussian media is crediting Islam, Artyom and other cloakroom attendants with saving the lives of over 100 people.\n\"I understood that if I didn't react, many people including me would lose their lives,\" Islam said. He added that he was the last to exit the venue, \"so that I didn't leave anyone behind\".\nGrand Mufti of Russia Ravil Gaynutdin said Islam would be presented with the Medal of Muslims of Russia during Friday prayers this week.

    "Moscow's New Arbat Avenue is lined with some of the biggest video screens in Russia.\nToday they're all displaying the same giant image: a burning candle and the Russian word \"Skorbim\" (\"We mourn.\")\nRussia is mourning the victims of the Crocus City Hall massacre. There is no final death toll. The search for bodies continues.\nAcross the country the Russian tricolour is flying at half mast, entertainment and sports events have been cancelled, TV newsreaders are wearing black.\nIt might not be in the centre of Moscow, but Crocus City Hall is one of the most prominent music venues in Russia.\nBut Friday's bloodbath turned a concert hall into hell. The attackers killed not only with bullets, but with fire. They set the building alight and created an inferno. Video released by Russia's Investigative Committee shows that the roof collapsed. Metal beams, too.\nOutside the building the police lines are still in place. From where I'm standing, I can see a single burned-out section of the entertainment complex. It's a hint of the devastation inside.\nPeople are queuing to lay flowers at a makeshift shrine to the victims of the atrocity. The mountain of tributes is growing ever larger. As well as leaving roses and carnations here, visitors are placing dolls and soft toys on the flowers. That's because among the dead were children.\nPeople have been leaving messages, too. One is addressed to the attackers:\n\"You are scum. We will never forgive you.\"\nAmong the crowd here there is a mixture of grief and anger.\n\"The country's heart is aching,\" says Tatyana, who's brought some flowers to lay here. \"My soul is crying. Russia is crying. So many young people were killed. It feels as if my own children have died.\"\n\"It was a big shock,\" says Roman. \"I live nearby, and I saw what happened from my window. It's horrific and a big tragedy.\"\n\"Whoever carried this out, they are not human. They are our enemies,\" a pensioner called Yevgeny tells me. \"I think we should cancel the moratorium on the death penalty. At least for terrorists.\"\nFour suspects have been charged with committing acts of terrorism for their alleged role in the shooting, and have been ordered to remain in custody for two months by Moscow's Basmanny district court.\nThey have been identified as Dalerdzhon Barotovich Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov on the Moscow courts' official Telegram channel.\nMr Mirzoyev, a Tajik national, is reported to have pleaded guilty to all charges.\nThe Islamic State group has claimed it was behind the mass shooting at Crocus City Hall. It has released graphic images of the attackers on the rampage. US officials have said they have no reason to doubt that claim of responsibility.\nThe reaction here has been very different.\nRussian officials have been promoting the idea that, somehow, in some way, Ukraine was behind the brutal attack.\nIn his TV address on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that the four gunmen had been arrested trying to flee to Ukraine. He alleged that \"a window had been prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the border.\"\nKyiv has dismissed such suggestions. That hasn't stopped pro-Kremlin commentators from echoing claims of a Ukrainian connection.\nOn its website the pro-government newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets has published a rabidly anti-Ukrainian opinion piece. Entitled \"Ukraine must be declared a terrorist state\", the article reached this conclusion: \"It's time to destroy the Kyiv regime\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 all that gang must die. Russia has the resources to do this.\"\nWhich raises a key question. How will the Kremlin react to this devastating attack?

    "A Japanese nappy maker has announced that it will stop producing diapers for babies in the country and, instead, focus on the market for adults.\nOji Holdings is the latest firm to make such a shift in a rapidly ageing Japan, where birth rates are at a record low.\nSales of adult nappies outpaced those for infants in the country for more than a decade.\nThe number of babies born in Japan in 2023 - 758,631 - was down by 5.1% from the previous year.\nIt was also the lowest number of births on record in Japan since the 19th Century. In the 1970s, that figure stood at more than two million.\nIn a statement , Oji Holdings said its subsidiary, Oji Nepia, currently manufactures 400 million infant nappies annually. Production has been falling since 2001, when the company hit its peak - 700 million nappies.\nBack in 2011, Japan's biggest diaper maker, Unicharm, said its sales of adult diapers had surpassed those for babies.\nMeanwhile, the adult diaper market has been growing and is estimated to be worth more than $2bn (\u00c2\u00a31.6bn). Japan now has one of the world's oldest populations, with almost 30% of them aged 65 or older. Last year, the proportion of those aged above 80 surpassed 10% for the first time .\nOji Holdings also said it would continue to make baby diapers in Malaysia and Indonesia where it expects demand to grow.\nA shrinking population, the result of both ageing and plummeting birth rates, has become a crisis for Japan, one of the world's largest economies. But the Japanese government's efforts to address these challenges have met with little success so far.\nIncreased spending on child-related programmes and subsidies targeting young couples or parents don't appear to be boosting birth rates. Expert say the reasons are complex, ranging from lower marriage rates and more women joining the workforce, to the increased costs of raising children.\n\"Japan is standing on the verge of whether we can continue to function as a society,\" Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said last year, adding that it was a case of \"now or never\".\nBut Japan is not alone. Fertility rates have also been dropping in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, the last of which has the lowest birth rate in the world.\nChina too saw its population fall for the second year in a row in 2023 and, like Japan, has introduced various incentives to boost birth rates. But an ageing population and the impact of a decades-long one child-policy, which ended in 2015, are creating demographic challenges in China too.",
    "Katie Price says there is \"nothing worse\" than women in their early 20s getting cosmetic procedures and wants to educate them about the risks.\nThe model and TV personality is known for going under the knife herself, but insisted she's \"not a hypocrite\".\n\"I didn't start doing my face until I was in my 40s. I had a boob job, but I didn't even have fillers,\" she said, warning it is \"damaging to your body\".\n\"I didn't do it all in my 20s. I think everyone looks like aliens these days.\"\nSpeaking to the podcast How To Fail With Elizabeth Day, Price, 45, said: \"I didn't have Botox till I was like 27/28. Lips I tried when they didn't know [how to do it] and I looked like a duck, but then I just relaxed on it.\n\"All the girls look the same now, and I think, what are they going to look like then when they're my age?\"\nPrice, who has five children, said the recovery process from her surgeries had \"put them off for life\".\n\"People don't realise when you have surgery and stuff, you only see before and after, you don't see in between - when you've had it, the pain and the cleaning, the stitches out and the bed rests.\n\"So I would love to educate people about it. It's damaging to your body. I've had so many anaesthetics. I know I still choose to do it, but I'm older now.\"\nShe said choosing her next plastic surgery was \"like going shopping, for me, which is so bad\".\n\"But I could go further than I have done. Sometimes I do look in the mirror and go, 'Ooh, are people looking because you look plastic, or are they looking because you look good?'\n\"There's nothing worse than when these young girls now, in their early 20s, who are all getting fillers, all getting lips, all getting the boobs [done].\"\nPrice has been sharing more of her personal life in recent years, including life behind the scenes with her disabled son, Harvey.\nShe has made a series of documentaries for the BBC about his life with autism and rare genetic disease Prader-Willi syndrome.\nIn July 2023, Price also said she had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and said she thinks that explains some of her poor choices.\nShe told the podcast: \"I've now been diagnosed, not that I believe in labels, but it makes sense that I've got severe ADHD. And it would make sense now, because I've made the wrong choices, done the wrong things, when really I'm just innocent [and] gullible.\n\"Yet, there's that side of me where I just can't help to say something or do something and we've worked out in my brain it's got to be my ADHD.\"\nPrice, who now generates some of her income from producing content on subscription website OnlyFans, has continued to attract tabloid interest for her romantic relationships and financial problems in recent years.\nShe was declared bankrupt for a second time earlier this month and said that wouldn't have happened \"if men had not been in my life\".\nPrice has been married three times, to singer Peter Andre from 2005 to 2009, a relationship she says was \"real\", but described her subsequent marriages to Alex Reid, from 2010 to 2012, and Kieran Hayler, from 2013 to 2021, as \"just rebounds\".\nShe has also been in and out of court a number of times in recent years for driving offences .",
    "The German Football Association's (DFB) decision to switch the supplier of the national team's kit away from Adidas has been blasted by politicians.\nThe contract will pass from the German company to US firm Nike from 2027.\nEconomy Minister Robert Habeck said he would have \"liked a bit more local patriotism\", while Health Minister Karl Lauterbach called the decision \"wrong\".\nThe DFB said the deal made financial sense and would support grassroots German football.\nAdidas has supplied the kit for the German national football team for more than 70 years.\nHowever, according to reports in the German press, Nike agreed to pay about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100m (\u00c2\u00a386m; $108m) per year to supply the kit, doubling Adidas's payment of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac50m.\nThe deal, announced on Thursday, was greeted with dismay by German politicians on the left and right.\n\"I can hardly imagine the German jersey without the three stripes,\" Mr Habeck said. \"For me, Adidas and black-red-gold always belonged together. A piece of German identity.\"\nMr Lauterbach said on X, formerly Twitter, it was \"a wrong decision where commerce destroys a tradition and a piece of home\".\nAnd Bavarian premier Markus Soeder said the national team always plays in the three stripes of Adidas. \"That was as clear as the fact that the ball is round and a game lasts 90 minutes,\" he said.\n\"The success story began in 1954 with the unforgettable World Cup victory, which gave our country self-confidence again. That's why it's wrong, a shame and also incomprehensible that this story should end now.\"\nHe said German football should not be \"a pawn in international corporate battles\" and that \"commerce isn't everything\".\nThe DFB said on X that it understood the emotional reaction to its decision, saying switching supplier after 70 years was a \"drastic event\" that \"doesn't leave us cold\".\nHowever, it said the grassroots of German football, with \"more than 24,000 football clubs, 2.2 million active players, the numerous volunteers and almost 55,000 referees\", is financed by the DFB.\n\"Against this background, the DFB has to make economic decisions,\" it said. \"Nike made by far the best financial offer in the transparent and non-discriminatory tender process.\"\n\"The future partnership with Nike ensures that we can continue to carry out our central tasks for football in the coming decade,\" it added.\nThe announcement of the Nike deal comes just months ahead of Euro 2024. Germany's men's team is using Adidas's headquarters in Herzogenaurach, near Nuremberg, as its base for the tournament, which Germany is hosting.\nAdidas said it would not comment on contractual details.\nThe row over the German kit comes as politicians in England criticise a Nike design for the England team kit.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said the St George's Cross should not be \"messed with\" after Nike used different colours, adding navy, light blue and purple to the traditional red.\nThe FA has defended the design , saying \"it is not the first time\" different colours have been used.",
    "York's annual Chocolate Festival, which celebrates the city's historic connection with the confectionery, returns over the Easter Weekend.\nThe event in Parliament Street in the city centre runs from Wednesday 27 until Sunday 31 March.\nChef Ashley McCarthy, who has appeared on Channel 4's Extreme Chocolate Makers, will be working on a chocolate house during the five-day festival.\nDirector Michael Hjort said there will be \"something for everyone\".\nHe said: \"It's great to see the Chocolate Festival is back in town to showcase the amazing local chocolatiers and businesses of York.\n\"There will be all sorts of sweet produce available for everyone of all ages, as well as lots of activities for small children like chocolate egg decorating and taste trails.\n\"The festival will be open until 18:00 GMT each day, so there will be something for everyone over the long weekend.\"\nOther attractions will include a chocolate market, face painting and an Easter egg hunt.\nYork Cocoa Works will also share their chocolate-making process by getting visitors to create their own chocolate Easter egg bar.\nAnd after the children have had their sugar fix, adults will be able to indulge in chocolate beer and gin tastings with York Gin, Brew York and Fairfax Distillery.\nThe festival, which has been a hit in York since 1997, was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe city is famous for its chocolate heritage as it is home to the former Rowntree's factory and headquarters, which developed Kit Kats and Smarties.\nChocolate brand Terry's was also founded in York in the 1700s.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram .

    "After months of warnings, a recent UN-backed report offered hard statistical evidence that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is turning into a man-made famine.\nIt has increased the pressure on Israel to fulfil its legal responsibilities to protect Palestinian civilians, and to allow adequate supplies of humanitarian aid to reach the people who need it.\nThe UN's most senior human rights official, Volker T\u00c3\u00bcrk, said in a BBC interview that Israel bore significant blame, and that there was a \"plausible\" case that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza.\nMr T\u00c3\u00bcrk, who is the UN high commissioner for human rights, said that if intent was proven, that would amount to a war crime.\nIsrael's economy minister, Nir Barkat, a senior politician in Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, dismissed Mr T\u00c3\u00bcrk's warnings as \"total nonsense - a totally irresponsible thing to say\".\nLike his cabinet colleagues, Mr Barkat insisted that Israel was letting in all the aid offered by the US and the rest of the world. Israel says the UN fails to distribute whatever is left once Hamas has helped itself.\nBut a long line of lorries fully loaded with aid supplies desperately needed in the Gaza Strip is backing up on the Egyptian side of the border with Rafah. They can only enter Gaza after a complex and bureaucratic series of Israeli checks.\nThe absence of adequate supplies has forced Jordan, and now other countries including the US and UK, to drop aid from the air - the least effective way to deliver humanitarian supplies.\nPalestinians on the ground fighting to secure a share have drowned as they try to swim to pallets that have landed in the sea, or have been crushed when parachutes fail.\nThe US Navy is also sending an engineering flotilla across the Atlantic to build a temporary pier to land aid by sea.\nNone of that would be necessary if Israel granted full road access to Gaza and expedited the delivery of relief supplies through the modern container port at Ashdod, only about half an hour's drive north of the Gaza Strip.\nIn an interview from Geneva, Mr T\u00c3\u00bcrk said evidence had emerged that Israel was slowing down or withholding the delivery of aid.\nMr T\u00c3\u00bcrk condemned the Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers on 7 October, including killing, rape and hostage-taking. But he also said that no side in the war should evade accountability for its actions, including for any attempt to withhold aid supplies from the people who need it in Gaza.\n\"All of my humanitarian colleagues keep telling us that there is a lot of red tape. There are obstacles. There are hindrances\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Israel is to blame in a significant way,\" he said.\n\"I can only say the facts speak for themselves\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I understand that this needs to be controlled, but it cannot take days for it to be done.\n\"When you put all kinds of requirements on the table that are unreasonable in an emergency\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that brings up the question, with all the restrictions that we currently see, whether there is a plausible claim to be made that starvation is, or may be used as, a weapon of war.\"\nConcern about humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip deepened last week with the release of a soberly written commentary alongside a series of maps, charts and statistics. It prompted more warnings from Israel's allies that it should change the way it is fighting the war against Hamas to spare civilians from death from either high explosive or hunger.\nThe study is the latest report from a respected international network, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, known as IPC. It provides governments, the UN and aid agencies with apolitical data to measure the scale of hunger. The headline on the report was stark - \"Gaza Strip: Famine is imminent as 1.1 million people, half of Gaza, experience catastrophic food insecurity.\"\nIts data explained how famine could come at any time in the next eight weeks or so if there was no ceasefire and relief aid did not pour into the Gaza Strip.\nPalestinian parents who had managed to bring sick and hungry children to one of the few hospitals still operating in Gaza after Israel's onslaught did not have to wait for the statistics. For weeks and months, as they struggled to feed them, they have watched their children decline.\nGaza is no place to be ill. One young girl at the hospital, reached by a Palestinian freelance journalist working for the BBC, lay semi-conscious on a bed.\nThe girl, Noora Mohammed, has lung and liver fibrosis, conditions that can be fatal even in peacetime. In the months of starvation since the war began, and without the right medical care, she is deteriorating fast.\n\"My daughter can't move,\" her mother said. \"She's anaemic, always sleeping, and there's nothing nutritious to eat.\"\nAt least Noora reached hospital. Most of just over one million Gazans considered to be in acute need will not have that option.\nThe evidence of Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe is overwhelming. Our pictures from the hospital showed children with swollen joi",
    "\"Hold up - do you know how to drive this thing?\"\nThese black bears wasted no time clambering on to a swan pedalo when it appeared in their enclosure at Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire.\nKeeper Tommy Babbington added the quirky paddle boat to keep the animals entertained after a large pool of water formed at the site during the recent wet weather.\n\"It was great fun for visitors to see them climb on board,\" he said.\nThe black bear is the most common bear in the forests of North America - where it is unlikely they are given giant plastic watercraft.\nThey can grow up to 1.9m (6ft 3in) long and weigh up to 300kg (47 stone).\n\"We love devising new ways to provide food, scent and habitat enrichment that stimulates their natural foraging behaviours,\" added Mr Babbington.\n\"There's been so much wet weather this year that a new mini lake has formed in the black bears' drive-through, so we had the idea of turning this into interesting enrichment for them.\n\"The sleuth of bears was immediately intrigued by their new neighbour and wasted no time in investigating the swan paddle boat.\"\nFollow East of England news on Facebook , Instagram and X .

    "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faces a by-election test in May in the marginal constituency of Blackpool South.\nScott Benton, who was sitting as an independent MP for the area, announced his resignation on Monday.\nHe had been suspended from the Conservatives after a lobbying scandal and was facing a recall vote to boot him out next month.\nThe by-election is set to take place on the same day as local elections on 2 May.\nGovernment Chief Whip Simon Hart issued the writ for the vacant seat in the House of Commons.\nToday was also the last date the government could have announced a general election on 2 May but the prime minister had already ruled this out, saying it is still likely to be in the second half of the year.\nMr Sunak will not be relishing the prospect of another by-election as he tries to shore up his party's prospects in the general election, in the face of poor opinion poll ratings .\nBlackpool South will be the fourth by-election this year, and the 13th since Mr Sunak entered No 10, with only one of those seats being won by the Tories .\nScott Benton became MP there in 2019 with a slender 3,690 majority over Labour, which had held the seat since 1997.\nHe was secretly filmed saying he could lobby ministers to undercover Times reporters posing as gambling industry investors.\nThe MP had been sitting as an independent MP since losing the Tory whip in April last year.\nHe lost an appeal against a suspension, after a Commons investigation found he had caused \"significant damage\" to Parliament's reputation.\nThis triggered a recall petition, where local voters would have had until 22 April to decide whether to sack him as their MP.\nInstead, he announced his departure on Facebook, saying being an MP \"had been the honour of a lifetime\".\nMPs are not technically allowed to resign and instead have to be appointed Steward of either the Chiltern Hundreds, or of the Manor of Northstead, as Mr Benton has been, on an alternating basis.\nThis appointment disqualifies them from being an MP and each new appointment revokes the previous, so Mr Benton has displaced Chris Pincher , who quit last year after a sex scandal, as Steward of the Manor of Northstead.\nThat allows a process, known as moving the writ, to start a countdown with a polling day between 21 and 27 working days later.\nThe writ is an order for the election be held, sent from the Speaker to the constituency returning officer, who then sets the date.\nThe Blackpool South by-election will be the 23rd in this Parliament , which started in 2019, and this is the most by-elections in one parliament since 24 were held in the 1987-1992 Parliament.",

    "Millions of Turks vote in elections on Sunday to decide who runs their biggest cities - and whether President Recep Tayyip Erdogan can wrest back control from the opposition.\nTurkey's economic and social powerhouse, Istanbul, was won by a united opposition five years ago under popular mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, shattering the president's long run of electoral success.\nNow Mr Erdogan, who was born in this megacity of 16 million people, wants it back and the vote is on a knife-edge.\nWhatever happens in Istanbul is being seen as a crucial test of whether the opposition can pose a serious threat to Mr Erdogan and his AK Party in the next presidential elections in four years' time.\n\"Istanbul is his home. Losing Istanbul to the opposition in the 2019 local elections was devastating for him,\" says Ihsan Aktas of the department of communication at Istanbul Medipol University and chair of the Genar Political Research Centre.\nIstanbul was where he grew up, selling sesame bread snacks called Simits before going into politics in the 1970s.\nHe headed an Islamist party's youth branch in the district of Beyogluthen, and rose through the ranks to become mayor, prime minister and ultimately president of Turkey.\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan secured a third term in presidential elections last year, but in this latest vote the main opposition party, the secular CHP, is hoping to hold on to big cities that it won back in dramatic fashion five years ago. Not just Istanbul, but the capital Ankara and the tourist city of Antalya.\nUntil 2019, the ruling AK Party and its Islamist predecessors had run the two biggest cities for 25 years.\nIn Istanbul the opposition even defeated his candidate twice, as the AKP alleged there had been irregularities and officials ordered a re-run.\n\"Although the opposition lost against Erdogan in last year's presidential election, there is still a strong link between winning Istanbul and winning Turkey,\" says Seda Demiralp, professor of political science at the city's Isik University.\n\"If Imamoglu manages to keep Istanbul, the opposition will still have high hopes for the upcoming 2028 presidential elections.\"\nIhsan Aktas agrees that whoever wins will have enormous influence beyond Istanbul: \"When you have the backing of Istanbul, you directly become an actor in the national politics. And globally too.\"\nThe city hosts a fifth of Turkey's population of nearly 85 million people, and it has a diverse electorate from different political, ethnic, religious and economic backgrounds.\nControl Istanbul and you control a significant portion of Turkey's economy including trade, tourism and finance.\nThe candidate chosen to run for Mr Erdogan's party in Istanbul is Murat Kurum, a 47-year-old former minister for the environment and urbanisation. But it may as well be a race between Ekrem Imamoglu and Mr Erdogan.\nA former businessman, 52-year-old Mr Imamoglu rose to prominence as mayor of the city's little-known middle-class district of Beylikduzu and he is viewed as President Erdogan's biggest challenger in decades.\n\"In 2019 we closed a chapter, and on 31 March, [the AKP] will be history,\" he told supporters at a rally in Beylikduzu.\nAnother victory would bolster his political clout and pave the way for him to run for the presidency in four years' time, political commentators say.\nThe mayor of Ankara, Mansur Yavas, has also been tipped to run in 2028 and his route to victory on Sunday is seen as more secure.\nFor now Ekrem Imamoglu is keeping his sights on his current job.\n\"I have big dreams for Istanbul, I don't dream of anything else, but just fulfilling them for now,\" he told Turkish daily Cumhuriyet.\nDuring his five years in office, Turkey has been in the grip of an economic crisis, although the mayor highlights an extension to the city's rail system, more green spaces and a major house-building programme.\nBut there is another major concern that grips the people of Istanbul.\nLast year's double earthquake in southern Turkey left more than 53,000 people dead and seismologists warn that a devastating quake may hit Istanbul at any moment.\nPlans to demolish old, dilapidated buildings and build earthquake-resistant replacements are top of the agenda for the AKP.\n\"Murat Kurum is a name identified with urban development, and has a symbolic significance,\" says Ms Demiralp, but still \"it may not be enough to secure a victory\".\nPresident Erdogan and top ministers have made winning back Istanbul a personal goal, promising a new era from 31 March.\n\"Istanbul will be returned to its real owner,\" he promised hundreds of thousands of supporters at a rally in the city.\nNow aged 70, he has previously said these will be his last elections. He is in his third term as president and cannot rule beyond 2028 under the constitution.\nBut he hasn't picked any successors yet and Ihsan Akstas says pinpointing who might replace him as head of the AKP is extremely difficult.\n\"When we ask pollsters who they would like to see replacing Erdogan, they cannot thin",
    "The mother of a teenager who was fatally stabbed is calling for more life-saving bleed kits.\nA 30-mile (48km) charity walk from Weston-super-Mare to Bristol began earlier, to raise money for kits.\nIt has been organised in memory of best friends, Max Dixon, 16, and Mason Rist, 15, who were stabbed in Knowle West, Bristol, on 27 January.\nLeanne Eckland, Max's mother, said a bleed kit \"could have saved my boy's life.\"\nHer partner, Trevor Silk, is part of the group embarking on the challenge.\nSo far, more than \u00c2\u00a31,100 has been raised for the cause.\nSpeaking ahead of the charity walk, Ms Eckland said she had never heard of bleed kits prior to her son's death.\n\"We need people to be more aware of these bleed kits and they need to be out there and people need to know how to use them.\"\nThe kits, which contain contain equipment including bandages and tourniquets to help stem the flow of blood in an emergency, are being installed around the city.\nThey were created by Leanne Reynolds, an anti-knife campaigner and the founder of the Bristol Bleed Campaign.\nShe said each kit had the potential to save a life in the crucial moments before an ambulance can arrive.\nMax's funeral was held on Thursday , and Mason's was held on Friday .\nFamily, friends and members of the local community attended both services.\n\"You don't really take much notice to [knife crime] happening, but when it happens to you then it brings it home and it makes you realise that something needs to be done.\n\"It's not fair and it's not right,\" Ms Eckland said.\n\"Parents shouldn't be burying their children.\n\"My family's life is never going to be the same again, but if something positive can come out of Max and Mason's death then I will try and do what I can to do that.\"\nSeven people have been charged - five with murder - in connection with the deaths of Max and Mason.

    "Concerns have been raised of a \"ripple effect\" on global supply chains after a container ship crashed into a bridge in the US city of Baltimore.\nThe ship, named the Dali, hit a support column of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early hours of Tuesday morning, causing it to collapse.\nThe bridge spanned the entrance to the Port of Baltimore, the busiest port in the US for car exports and the ninth-busiest for foreign cargo.\nSix people are missing presumed dead.\nOfficials have said that maritime traffic through the port - which last year amounted to more than 47 million tonnes of foreign cargo - will be suspended \"until further notice\".\nThe suspension could have a \"significant ripple effect on global supply chains\", Marco Forgione, director general at The Institute of Export and International Trade, told the BBC.\nMore than 750,000 cars and vehicles passed through Baltimore in the last year, he told Radio 4's The World Tonight.\nThese include US, UK and EU brands such as General Motors, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan, Fiat, and Audi.\nBaltimore is the busiest US port for car shipments, and also the largest US port by volume for handling farm and construction machinery.\nIt is also the second biggest port for US coal exports.\nUS Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said at a briefing there was \"no question that this will be a major and protracted impact to supply chains\".\n\"It's too soon to offer estimates on what it will take to clear the channel and reopen the port,\" he said.\nHowever, Baltimore is also one of the smallest container ports in the north-east US, handling 265,000 containers in the fourth quarter of last year, according to container shipping expert Lars Jensen.\nBy contrast, the Port of New York and New Jersey handled about 2 million containers in that same period, and Norfolk Port in Virginia handled 850,000.\nThe flow of containers to Baltimore can probably be redistributed to bigger ports, Mr Jensen said.\nInitially there were concerns that liquified natural gas (LNG) exports could be affected, but Cove Point LNG terminal on Chesapeake Bay, which typically exports about 500,000 tonnes of LNG per month to markets including the UK and the EU, said its operations had not been hit by the bridge collapse.\nPresident Biden told reporters that the US government would \"move heaven and earth to reopen the port and rebuild the bridge as soon as humanly possible\", but added that the process was going to \"take some time.\"\nAs well as maritime traffic, the Port of Baltimore is directly responsible for some 15,000 jobs and supports an estimated 140,000 more.\nFollowing the accident, Danish shipping giant Maersk, whose cargo the Dali was carrying, said it would be \"omitting Baltimore on all our services for the foreseeable future\".\nA number of rail and coal companies have also warned their customers of disruption to coal exports.\nThe US Coast Guard has suspended its search and rescue operation and begun a recovery mission for the missing people.\nThe focus is now turning to the investigation into what went wrong, with a team of transportation safety experts hoping to board the stricken ship and recover its data recorder.\nThe exact cause of the crash is still being established, but officials have said the ship suffered a \"power issue\" and issued a distress call before hitting the bridge.\nThe Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, where the Dali was flagged, said the ship's certificates covering its structural integrity and the functionality of its equipment were valid at the time of the incident.\nIt also said the ship had passed two separate foreign port state inspections in June and September 2023.\nSynergy Marine Group, which manages the Dali, said there were 22 people on the ship, including an all-Indian crew and two US harbour pilots, but no reports of any injuries.\nIt added that it was \"fully co-operating\" with federal agencies.",
    "Refining gold has a long history in the family of Satish Pratap Salunke.\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, he and his business collect scrap gold from jewellers, melt it down and sell it back to the jewellers in the form of gold bars.\nHe has two refineries, one in Kochi in the southern state of Kerala and the other in Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu. Relatives have refineries elsewhere in the south of India.\n\"Every day my refiners on an average melt two to three kilograms of gold,\" he says.\nAlmost every town in India will have at least one small refinery similar to those run by Mr Salunke. It is known as the \"unorganised\" refining sector, which distinguishes it from big refiners who make gold bars and coins from imported, unrefined gold.\nIt is estimated that, in total, Indian households hold a massive 25,000 tonnes of gold, and some of that is always available for sale, particularly when the price of gold is high or the economy is bad and people want to raise some cash.\nJewellers may process returned gold themselves but will often use small refiners who will make the gold back into bars.\nMr Salunke says local jewellers like to deal with small refiners like his, because they work quickly and are happy to accept cash.\n\"Most jewellers prefer buying gold from us, as we are based in every city with small units. A jeweller can take back his refined gold in a few hours, not like big refiners who will take days to refine the recycled gold.\"\nAccording to the World Gold Council, of the 900 tonnes of gold refined in India in 2023, 117 came from recycled sources.\nBut that recycling market is being eyed up by India's big industrial gold refiners.\nThey have expanded in recent years, spurred on by favourable import duties on their main source of gold - imported, unrefined gold known as gold dor\u00c3\u00a9.\nBetween 2013 and 2021, India's large-scale refiners increased their capacity from 300 to 1,800 tonnes of gold a year.\nBut it is difficult for them to import enough unrefined gold to keep their refineries running. In fact, less than 50% of their refining capacity is used, according to Harshad Ajmera, secretary of the Association of Gold Refiners and Mints.\nSo big refiners have been opening scrap collection centres in big cities, hoping to scoop up unwanted gold and turn it into high-quality bars.\n\"At present most of the recycling of gold is done by the unorganised sector [small refiners] - that has to change,\" says Mr Ajmera.\nMore technology of business\nHe wants India to become a global hub for gold refining, which would mean importing more unrefined gold and for the big firms to take over more of the gold recycling.\n\"Switzerland is the world's largest gold refining centre and transit hub. We want India also to be in the same position,\" says Mr Ajmera.\nCGR Metalloys is one of India's leading gold refiners, refining about 150 tonnes of gold a year.\nLike the other big players, it has the latest equipment for gold smelting and refining, which it says is better for the environment and can guarantee the purity of its gold to extremely high levels.\n\"The refined bullion is analysed to the highest levels of accuracy, on various methods of gold assaying,\" says James Jose, managing director at CGR.\nIt has opened three gold recycling centres in the state of Kerala.\n\"Indian refineries have a huge capacity... we have huge overheads. So setting up collection centres will increase the flow of scrap gold. This will help increase my output by 30% to 40%,\" says Mr Jose.\nIn recent years, the government has become more involved in the refining industry. In 2020 the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced a range of standards for gold bars including purity, weight, markings and dimensions.\nBIS-approved refiners can sell their bars to the commodity markets.\n\"The industry is gradually shifting towards greater organisation and efficiency, led by established refineries licensed by the Bureau of Indian Standards, which is setting trusted benchmarks for refined gold products, which will make India a global hub,\" says Somasundaram PR, the chief executive of the World Gold Council India.\nSome figures suggest that smaller refiners are losing ground. According to consultancy Metals Focus , in 2015 between 70 and 75% of the recycling industry was unorganised; by 2021 this had declined to between 60 and 65%.\nThe moves made by big recycling firms do not concern Mr Salunke much - he says he knows his customers.\n\"Local jewellers are not willing to pay a recycling cost which is too much beyond what we charge,\" he says.\nAnd, like other smaller refiners, Mr Salunke has also been investing in modern refining technology.\nThey are moving away from using nitric acid to purify gold, instead switching to Aqua Regia, which is less polluting.\n\"The gold recycled by us is as pure as gold recycled by an organised refinery,\" says Mr Salunke. \"Now we have a testing facility to check the purity, so it would be wrong to say we cannot refine gold into its pu",
    "Jeremy Hunt has said the Conservatives will keep the triple lock system to decide rises in the state pension if they win the election.\nThe chancellor confirmed the pledge, which means the pension rises in line with average earnings growth, inflation or 2.5% - whichever is highest.\nHe told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg he was confident the \"expensive\" promise would be paid by growing the economy.\nLabour said it was \"committed to retaining\" the triple lock.\nHowever, it is yet to confirm if the pledge will feature in its election manifesto. \"We will set out those plans for our manifesto in detail,\" Labour party chair Anneliese Dodds told the BBC programme.\nThe state pension will rise by 8.5% in April.\nMr Hunt confirmed the current triple lock system to decide how much the payments rise each year would \"absolutely\" remain if the Conservatives win the general election, which must be held by 28 January 2025, for the whole of the next parliament.\n\"When we came to office in 2010, pensioners were more likely to be in poverty than other income groups, now because of the triple lock that we introduced they are less likely to be in poverty,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I think that is a very important social change because unlike adults of working age, pensioners can't work, they have retired and so we need to respect that.\"\nMr Hunt said he realised continuing the policy would be an \"expensive commitment\", but added: \"You can only make that commitment if you're confident that you're going to deliver the economic growth that is going to pay for it.\"\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the pledge was a \"shameless election trick by the Conservatives\" and claimed Mr Hunt was \"yet again taking pensioners for granted\".\nYael Selfin, chief economist at accountancy firm KPMG, said: \"It is easier to make this promise now that inflation is going down.\"\nInflation rose by 3.4% in the year to February, which is the lowest rate since September 2021 and Ms Selfin predicted that it would fall below the Bank of England's 2% target sooner than expected this year.\nMs Selfin said: \"The extra spending on pensions will not necessarily create a lot of growth on its own. [The chancellor] would need to find other ways to stimulate growth.\"\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer declined to say if the triple lock would be in his party's manifesto when asked by The Sun newspaper last week.\n\"We will have to see what the state of the economy is as we go into the election. We will publish all of our plans as we go in and answer that question, but I believe in the triple lock.\"\nThe state pension is a payment made every four weeks by the government to people who have reached the qualifying age and have paid enough National Insurance contributions. More than 12 million people in the UK receive it.\nCurrently, the pension is worth \u00c2\u00a3203.85 a week for the full, new flat-rate (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016 ), and \u00c2\u00a3156.20 a week for the full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016 ).\nIn April, the two payments will rise to \u00c2\u00a3221.20 and \u00c2\u00a3169.50 per week respectively, taking the annual totals to \u00c2\u00a311,502 and \u00c2\u00a38,814.\nNext month's increase is set to be the second significant rise in the state pension in two years, after a 10.1% increase in April 2023.\nThe triple lock is designed to ensure pensioners, especially if they rely solely on the state pension, are able to afford rising prices, or keep pace with the increases in the working population's wages.\nIt was introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010, but there has been debate over whether it can continue in the long-term future due to its costs.\nThe state pension cost \u00c2\u00a3110.5bn in 2022-2023, just under half the total amount the government spends on benefits , and the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, estimated the level would grow to \u00c2\u00a3124bn in 2023-2024.\nPaul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies economic think tank, told the BBC he was not surprised by Mr Hunt's pledge to keep the policy in place due to pensioners being an important voting demographic to the Conservative party.\nBut he warned: \"It can't go on forever and they need to give an indication to when they want it to stop.\"\nThe rate of price rises in the UK - inflation - has been high in recent years, putting pensioners, as well as working families under financial pressure.\nInflation has fallen sharply but interest rates are still at a 16-year high after being raised by the Bank of England in recent times to try to slow the pace of consumer prices rising.\nIt has made borrowing money on things such as credit cards and mortgages much more expensive for households, but has boosted returns for savers.\nMr Hunt said the UK was \"not there yet\" when asked whether the cost-of-living crisis had ended, but added that a fall in interest rates would \"make the biggest difference for families up and down "
