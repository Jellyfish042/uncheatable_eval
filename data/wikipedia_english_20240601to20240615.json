    "Slovak politician\nSlovak general and politician (1941\u20132019)\nJozef Tuchy\u0148a (11 November 1941 \u2013 9 November 2019) was a Slovak military general and politician. He served as the first Minister of the Interior of the independent Slovakia, the first chief of staff of the Slovak Armed forces and as a Member of the National Council of Slovakia.\nBiography\nJozef Tuchy\u0148a was born on 11 November 1941 in the village of Kr\u00e1sna Ves, which is located in the B\u00e1novce nad Bebravou county. In 1963 he completed the military logistics school in Bratislava and joined the Czechoslovak People's Army. Between 1974 and 1977 he studied at the Military Academy in Brno and from 1982 to 1984 he completed his studies at the General Staff Academy in Moscow. Afterwards he served with the command of the 13rd Tank Division in Topo\u013e\u010dany as well as the command of the Eastern Military District in Tren\u010d\u00edn. In 1988 he was promoted to general and in 1992 he became the chief commander of the Eastern Military District. In 1992 he resigned from the army and became the minister of Interior Affairs of Slovakia. Following the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia, he became the first interior minister of Slovakia as an independent country. Tuchy\u0148a held the post of the interior minister until 1994.\nIn 1994 Tuchy\u0148a resumed his military career. He became the first Chief of the General Staff of the newly formed Slovak army. In this role, Tuchy\u0148a contributed to establishment of a new military structure in line with the Western starnards, which led to a conflict with the authoritarian regime of Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar.\nIn the 1998 Slovak parliamentary election, Tuchy\u0148a ran for a parliament seat on the list of the Party of the Democratic Left. Due to his political activities he suspended his military role, although he formally retained his position as the Chief of Staff until the elections, resisting the attempts of the government to dismiss him before the elections.\nHe successfully won a seat in the National Council and retired from the army for good. As a politician, Tuchy\u0148a was nominated by his party for the post of the minister of defense, but failed to win the support of the prime minister Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda and president Rudolf Schuster, both of whom preferred a civilian candidate. When his nomination was withdrawn, Tuchy\u0148a was very vocal about his disappointment and subsequently left the party and served the rest of his term as an independent MP.\nTuchy\u0148a died on 9 November 2019 in Pie\u0161\u0165any at the age of 77.\n",
    "2024 mobile game\n2023 video game\nSquad Busters is an online mobile action game developed and published by the Finnish video game company Supercell. The game was released globally on 29 May 2024 for the Android and iOS platforms.\nThe game is a crossover of other video games by Supercell, featuring characters from Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Brawl Stars, Hay Day, and Boom Beach.\nGameplay\nIt is a casual strategy game in which the player collects coins and gems from other squads, from loot scattered on the map, and from monsters. Coins allow you to purchase chests with which you can get new characters to join your squad. Gems allow you to rank in the game, since the player with the most gems when time ends wins.\nIn the video game there are a total of 34 monsters, 22 modifiers and 12 different spells; the modifiers are chosen randomly at the start of the game, while the spells can be unlocked as you progress through the game. A match consists of collecting as many gems as possible in a 10-player online match which can be obtained by defeating monsters, cutting down trees, searching bushes, destroying crates, obtaining coins and defeating enemies if you have more.\nAt the start of the game you are asked to choose between 3 random characters in your possession and to obtain other characters during the course of the match it is necessary to collect coins which can be found in the same way as gems. When the necessary coins have been obtained the player can approach one chest that requires a specific number of coins, which increases based on how many characters you have at the time, to again choose 1 of 3 random characters. Although very rarely, it is possible to find \"mega\" characters in chests, that is, much more powerful than normal characters. However, they are consumables, so using them will result in the use of mega units. You can get more mega units from the pass or in-app purchases.\nIn the game the characters in your possession are in a group that is moved by the player all together, around the group there is an \"attack area\" in which if the group is stationary and in the area there is an object, a monster or an enemy, will be attacked by the party. If three identical characters are chosen, they merge into one larger character.\nDevelopment and release\nThe video game was announced on January 31, 2023, and then had a limited release in beta version on February 6 of the same year only for Canada and then ended on February 16. Subsequently, in May 2023 another limited beta (Android only) was announced which lasted from May 22 until May 29 available only in Canada, Mexico and Spain.\nAlmost a year after the last beta, on April 1, 2024, \"many exciting new features\" were announced for the future of the game. Subsequently, on April 8 of the same year it was announced that the game will be available in soft launch from April 23 in Canada, Mexico, Spain, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Singapore.\nOn April 25, 2024, it was revealed that the video game will be released globally on May 29 of the same year.\nIn the video game there are 27 characters from other Supercell products, 10 from Clash Royale/Clash of Clans, 11 from Brawl Stars, 2 from Hay Day, 3 from Boom Beach and 1 from Hay Day Pop.\nReception\nPocket Gamer's Iwan Morris rated the game 4.5 out of 5. He described Squad Busters as a \"good mobile game\", praising its simplicity and graphics. He noted \"if you don\u2019t like Supercell\u2019s style then this likely won\u2019t sway you\".\n",

It was named the National School of Administration and Magistracy (ENAM) from 1975 to 1995.\nOrganization\nThe current director-general is Mouhamadou Lamine Diallo, a civil administrator of exceptional class.\nENA has two training cycles:\nA training cycle for A1 hierarchy officials (Cycle A), which trains the following corps of officials:\n * Civil Administrators\n * Treasury Inspectors\n * Tax and Property Inspectors\n * Foreign Affairs Advisors\n * Customs Inspectors\n * Labor and Social Security Inspectors\n * Economic Investigation Commissioners\nStudents in Cycle A are recruited from graduates holding at least a master's degree for the direct competition and from A or B hierarchy officials with 5 years of public service experience for the professional competition.\nA training cycle for B2 hierarchy officials (Cycle B), which trains the following corps of officials:\n * Administration Secretaries\n * Treasury Controllers\n * Tax and Property Controllers\n * Chancellors\n * Labor and Social Security Controllers\n * Economic Investigation Controllers\nStudents in Cycle B are recruited from graduates holding at least a baccalaureate for the direct competition and from B or C hierarchy officials.\nUnlike other sections, the customs section does not train customs controllers, who are trained at the customs school.\nThe entrance exam to this school is known for being very selective. In 2011, nearly 18,000 candidates (all cycles and sections combined) applied for 147 open positions.\nThe school's popularity is likely due to the fact that it is the only training school that guarantees employment to its graduates, opening doors to high-level administration in Senegal.\nENA has seven sections:\nLabor and Social Security\nDiplomacy\nCustoms\nTreasury\nTax and Property\nEconomic Investigations\nGeneral Administration/Central and Territorial Administration\nSince 2002, ENA has published the Bulletin de liaison de l'\u00c9cole nationale d'administration.\nNotable alumni\nMoustapha Niasse, politician, Prime Minister under Abdou Diouf and Abdoulaye Wade, President of the National Assembly of Senegal from 2012 to 2022\nMamadou Lamine Loum, politician, Prime Minister under Abdou Diouf from 1998 to 2000\nOusmane Tanor Dieng, politician, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party\nCoumba Ndoff\u00e8ne Bouna Diouf, politician, minister under Macky Sall\nAbdoulaye Diop, Minister of Economy and Finance under Abdoulaye Wade\nAbdoulaye Daouda Diallo, politician, Minister of the Interior under Macky Sall\nMamadou Dieng, politician, accountant of the Independent National Electoral Commission\nViviane Bampassy, politician, Minister of Public Service, Rationalization of Staff, and Renewal of Public Service under Macky Sall\nOusmane Sonko, politician, deputy from 2017 to 2022, mayor of Ziguinchor since January 2022\nAmadou Ba, politician, Prime Minister under Macky Sall\nBruno Diatta, ambassador then minister chief of Protocol of the Presidency of the Republic from 1979 to 2018\nMari\u00e8me Thi\u00e9o Ciss\u00e9 Doucour\u00e9, delegate minister in charge of Local Authorities under Abdoulaye Wade\nB\u00e9thio Thioune, civil administrator, religious leader\nBassirou Diomaye Faye, politician, 5th President of the Republic of Senegal\nSee also\nSenegal portalEducation portal\nEducation in Senegal\n\u00c9cole nationale de la France d'outre-mer\n",

    "Unregistered political party in Ingushetia, Russia\nNijsxo (Ingush: \u041d\u0438\u0439\u0441\u0445\u043e; Russian: \u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, lit.\u2009'justice') is an unregistered political party active in the Russian republic of Ingushetia since 1988.\nHistory\nNijsxo was founded by Issa Kodzoev as the \"Nijsxo Initiative Group in Support of Perestroika\" in May 1988. In March of the next year the party launched a campaign for the establishment of an Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, separate from the Checheno-Ingush ASSR, with its capital in the city of Ordzhonikidze (now Vladikavkaz, North Ossetia\u2013Alania). Nijsxo supported non-violent methods to facilitate the return of Ingush borders to their pre-1934 size, including public pressure on the North Ossetian and Soviet governments, though it was not successful.\nNijsxo participated in the founding Congress of the Ingush People on 9 September 1989, and Kodzoev was selected as leader of the congress. In December 1989, however, Kodzoev was removed and replaced by the more moderate Beksultan Seynaroyev\u00a0. The split between Nijsxo and the Congress became clearer following a 7 January 1990 rally by Nijsxo, which became a riot, although Nijsxo remained formally part of the congress until November 1992.\nThe party opposed the 1991 Ingush referendum, on the basis that a referendum to affirm Ingush sovereignty was unnecessary, and actively attempted to prevent the referendum's results from being recognised. Based in Nazran, Nijsxo was more active in rural Ingushetia than the Congress, which was based in the Chechen capital of Grozny and maintained only a token presence in villages. In contrast to the pro-Russian congress, Nijsxo supported Dzhokhar Dudayev and Zviad Gamsakhurdia, as well as the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus, although they did not endorse Pan-Caucasianism.\nFollowing the outbreak of the East Prigorodny conflict and the declaration of a state of emergency over North Ossetia and Ingushetia, Nijsxo was de jure required to stop its activities. De facto, however, Nijsxo actively worked alongside Ruslan Aushev, who was head of the Temporary Administration for the State of Emergency in Ingushetia. The party was part of Aushev's Union for National Accord of Ingushetia in the 1993 Ingush presidential election, but refused to support Aushev after he banned all political organisations and aceded to the Treaty of Federation before having prior demanded the return of Prigorodny District to Ingushetia.\nNijsxo was largely reduced in size by the summer of 1993, although it has continued to remain active in local and regional affairs. The organisation's leader after Kodzoev, Issa Dashlakiyev, condemned the abolition of direct elections for the heads of the republics of the North Caucasus in a 2013 letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The party also expressed support for the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and called on Putin to return Prigorodny District to Ingushetia. Head of Ingushetia Yunus-bek Yevkurov met with Kodzoev in his capacity as a member of Nijsxo in 2017 as part of a commemorative ceremony for the 25th anniversary of Ingushetia's status as a republic.\n",

    "Chinese TV series\nThe Lonely Warrior (Chinese: \u4e09\u5927\u961f) is a 2023 crime suspense online drama in mainland China, adapted from the short documentary work \"Please tell the Director, the mission of Brigade Three has been completed\" by writer Shen Lan. The play is directed by Xing JianJun , written by Xing JianJun and Li SifuLi Sifu\u00a0 , starring Qin Hao, Li Naiwen\u00a0, Chen Minghao\u00a0, and Ma Yinyin\u00a0, with Tong Liya as a special guest star and Ren Min\u00a0 as a special guest star. It will be broadcast on iQiyi Mist Theater on December 21, 2023.\nBroadcast time\nUnless otherwise specified, all times in this article are East Eighth Standard Time (UTC+8).\nSynopsis\nAfter an interrogation gone wrong, Detective Cheng Bing  (played by Qin Hao) from the Third Brigade was imprisoned and served his sentence. His teammates were implicated, dismissed from the police force, and demoted, leading to the disbandment of the former Third Brigade. After spending ten years in prison, Cheng Bing regained his freedom, but his faith was shattered, his passion extinguished, and he lost everything. Meanwhile, the suspect in the case, Wang Dayong, remained at large. However, wearing a police uniform for just a day instilled in Cheng Bing a sense of righteousness that would last a lifetime. The Third Brigade felt compelled to explain their actions, but their unwillingness morphed into determination, and they once again unsheathed the sharp blade of justice. Cheng Bing and his brothers from the Third Brigade regrouped and embarked on a journey to pursue the murderer. Throughout the lonely and arduous pursuit, they collaborated with law enforcement, chasing the murderer across thousands of miles. After 13 years and eight city-wide searches, Wang Dayong was finally apprehended and brought to justice. Through this ascetic journey, Cheng Bing rediscovered the coordinates and meaning of life.\nCast\nSoundtrack\nEpisode features\nTheme meaning\nThroughout the story of the TV series \"The Lonely Warrior\", the theme of \"Justice may be late, but it will never be absent\" resonates. The Three Brigades, with their persistence and sense of justice, safeguarded the hearts of the people, allowing the audience to experience the reality of life and its profound background. Through the struggles and sacrifices of the characters, the audience deeply grasps that the pursuit of justice is the most precious aspect of life.\nNarrative Technique\nThe TV series \"The Lonely Warrior\" no longer focuses solely on the novelty of the case but shifts the narrative's focus to the changes in the characters' fates. It utilizes the characters' life trajectories and beliefs to resonate with the audience on a deeper level. \"The Lonely Warrior\", as a new work of iQiyi Mist Theater, embodies the theater's innovative ideas in the suspense drama genre. The creators aim for the drama to embody the creative concept of \"emphasizing fate lines, focusing more on plot than emotion\", imbuing it with a more humanistic spirit.\nSeries promotion\nOn September 21, 2023, the TV series \"The Lonely Warrior\" unveiled its stills and officially announced the lineup. The show also released its first trailer on the same day. Later, on December 18, the show released storytelling stills.

Also on December 21, a special episode featuring the protagonist Cheng Bing was released. Additionally, on the same day, the show released a drama calendar, followed by the release of the drama \"Life\" poster on December 22.\nBehind the scenes\nPreparation\nIn March 2022, Xing Jianjun decided to create the TV series \"The Lonely Warrior, and script discussions began. By December 2022, the basic script was completed, and as the filming progressed from preparation to start, the script was continuously revised and polished.\nScriptwriting\nThe TV series \"The Lonely Warrior\" is adapted from Shenlan's work \"Please tell the Director, the mission of Brigade Three has been completed\". This prototype story provides a valuable first draft outline, and the series cleverly retained it during the adaptation process. The core content not only shows the charm of the original story, but also adds more details and plot development through in-depth expansion, making the story richer.\nThe creative team interviewed many veteran police officers and detectives.

    "Planned skyscraper in Manhattan, New York\n175 Park Avenue, formerly known as Project Commodore, is a mixed-use supertall designed by Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill and developed by RXR Realty and TF Cornerstone that is proposed to be built on the former site of the Commodore Hotel, currently the Hyatt Grand Central New York. As approved, the structure is planned to rise to a pinnacle height of 1,575 feet (480\u00a0m), with the tower containing office space, a Hyatt hotel, and ground-level and underground retail.\nArchitecture\nIllustrated elevation of the proposed tower's lobby\nRendering of 175 Park Avenue's design as first proposed in 2021\n175 Park Avenue was designed by T. J. Gottesdiener of Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill. The lobby of the building tapers outwards from its footprint in order to increase its visual separation from the adjacent Grand Central Terminal, and is defined by a web of interlaced steel columns which fan from several points at ground level, limited by the presence of rail infrastructure below the site. These columns are clad in a painted metal finish and continue for the height of the building. The tower is interspersed with outdoor terraces and culminates at a lattice crown, where the exterior columns again interlace echoing the design of the lobby facade. The inverted tapering of the building's base allows for an approximately 24,000 square foot elevated public terrace designed by James Corner Field Operations, wrapping around the building's base and accessible by stair and elevators from 42nd Street.\nAs first proposed in February 2021, the design called for four intermediate terraces, each framed by expressed parallel struts. However, by the time of its approval in December 2021, images released by RXR Realty revealed a revised design with three intermediate terrace levels and a reduced number of exterior columns, now offset at each terrace level by diagonal struts.\nHistory\nHyatt Grand Central New York, the structure currently occupying the development's site\nPlans for the redevelopment were first announced by RXR Realty and TF Cornerstone in 2019, with the development team taking over Hyatt's 100-year lease of the site and seeking to build 2\u00a0million square feet of office space, a size made possible by the 2017 Midtown East rezoning. Details of the development were first publicly revealed in February 2021, proposing a maximum height of 1,653 feet (504\u00a0m), with a prelimiary design that rose to an architectural height of 1,565 feet (477\u00a0m). The proposal was approved by the New York City Council in December 2021 at a revised height of 1,575 feet (480\u00a0m). In addition to a proposed 2.5\u00a0million square feet of commercial office space, the proposal includes a 200-room, 453,000 square foot Hyatt hotel at its highest levels, as well as 10,000 square feet of ground-level and underground retail alongside an expanded transit hall. RXR Realty opened a leasing gallery for the development in the nearby One Vanderbilt in October 2023.\nSee also\nList of tallest buildings in New York City\nList of tallest buildings in the United States\n",

    "The Rescue and Salvage Bureau of the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China (\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u8f93\u90e8\u6551\u52a9\u6253\u635e\u5c40) (short form, China Rescue and Salvage) is an institution directly under the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China. It is the most important maritime rescue and salvage organization in China, and the only one that operates at national level. It is based in Beijing. As of 2022, it had 10,000 employees, 80% of whom were professional technical personnel, divers, and crew, manning 191 vessels (76 specialist rescue vessels, and 132 specialist salvage vessels), 20 rescue aircraft and 21 specialist rescue teams.\nCRS has gained a good international reputation for its willingness and ability to operate in extreme bad sea conditions, receiving a number of international prizes. The CRS also engages in commercial salvage work, and other forms of marine engineering.\nHistory\nThe origin of China Rescue and Salvage are in a series of local institutions based in Shanghai. In 1951, with the approval of the Central People's Government, the Central Ministry of Communications decided to merge the Maritime (Salvage) Department of the State-owned Maritime Transport Bureau with the nationalized Huaxing Salvage Company. On 24 August 1951, a new state-owned enterprise, the Chinese People's Salvage Company was established in Shanghai, responsible for navigation and salvage at the Huangpu River and Yangtze River estuaries. The company had to deal with 59 shipwrecks at the bottom of the Huangpu River that had sank from the end of 1948 to the beginning of 1949 (during the civil war), and with hundreds of shipwrecks in the Yangtze River estuary channel, by sealing holed hulls and pumping water, mud removal, barge lifting, shipwreck removal, and channel dredging. The company had 120 employees, including 6 members of the Chinese Communist Party.\nOn 4 November 1952, Chen Yun, director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council, issued Public License No. 243 to the China People's Salvage Company. At that time, the company had only one 125-kilowatt tug (the Panshan -- \u76d8\u5c71\u53f7) and more than ten small barges. In four years, the company managed to remove 104 wrecks of around 100,000 tons total displacement, mostly from the Huangpu and Yangtze delta. From 12 February 1953, the Chinese People's Salvage Company used the name \"Salvage Company of the General Administration of Navigation Engineering\". Zhang Zhikui served as the manager from August 1953 until January 1966. From 1 January 1956, the company's name changed to \"Salvage Engineering Bureau of the General Administration of Navigation Engineering\", still with the nature of a business institution. On 1 July 1958, it was renamed Shanghai Salvage Engineering Bureau. \nOn 23 July 1958, the then Minister of Transportation Wang Shoudao ordered the merging of maritime rescue with salvage operations. From 16 September 1958, shipwrecks in the coastal waters of China from Wenzhou to the mouth of the Yalu River were placed under the responsibility of the Shanghai Salvage Engineering Bureau, making the SSEB into the first national-level combined rescue and salvage organization. The SSEB first set up three rescue stations at Yantai, Shanghai, and Wenzhou. On 15 February 1963, the Shanghai Salvage Engineering Bureau was renamed the Shanghai Maritime Rescue and Salvage Bureau. In December 1963, the Ministry of Communications set up the Yantai Rescue Station and the Tianjin Rescue Station as detached units. By the first half of 1964, five rescue stations had been built in Tianjin, Yantai, Shanghai, Wenzhou, and Xiamen.\nA major inciting incident for the development of Chinese maritime rescue occurred on 9 October 1973, when the Greek freighter Baltic Klif sank outside of Fujian province during Typhoon Nora without effective response by the Chinese authorities of the port of Xiamen, which made Zhou Enlai complain about the \"cowardice\" of the slow reaction. This extremely sharp rebuke (in the middle of the Cultural Revolution, when such rebukes tended to have dangerous outcomes) caused a drive to strengthen coastal rescue networks across the country.\nAs a reaction, in 1973 the State Council and the Central Military Commission jointly issued a document to establish the National Maritime Security Command. In 1974, a national maritime search and rescue work conference was held in Qingdao. The meeting decided that the Ministry of Transport would establish two new maritime security headquarters in Yantai and Guangzhou. The Guangzhou Maritime Rescue and Salvage Bureau (the former Third Engineering Team of China People's Salvage Company) was created that same year, and on 28 September 1974, the Yantai Shipwreck Rescue and Salvage Bureau of the Ministry of Transport was officially established. On 30 April 1975, the Tianjin and Yantai rescue stations were formally transferred to the Yantai Salvage Bureau, and 308 employees, 3 tugboats, 3 salva",

In 1993 it was suggested that protection should be extended to the Muhere Forest.\nHowever, only one guard was assigned to monitor what he called the Murehe Reserve, at that time thought to cover over 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres).\nA plan for a Northern Aquatic Landscape (Paysage Aquatique du Nord) was issued in 2005, proposing to create a Protected Aquatic Landscape and a Strict Nature Reserve from Murehe to Bugesera.\nThe Lacs du Nord Aquatic Landscape Protected Area was created in 2006, expanding on the Lake Rwihinda protected area. \nIn theory this conserves over 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of aquatic environment with integrated community management, agricultural production, and lake conservation.\nIt includes the integrated Natural Reserve of Murehe; the managed Reserves of Lake Rwihinda, Lake Rweru and Lake Cohoha, and the integrated protected zones of Lake Gacamirinda, Lake Mwungere, Lake Nagitamo, and Lake Kanzigiri.\nHowever, coltan and cassiterite extraction have been reported in the Murehe Reserve, which degrades fish habitat in the nearby lakes.\nThe Murehe forest is also threatened by encroachment.\nThe total area of the Protected Northern Aquatic Landscape covered by the Ramsar Convention is 16,242 hectares (40,130 acres), including eight lakes and the Murehe Reserve, which now covers just 3,075 hectares (7,600 acres).\nThe protected landscape was formally created by decree on 12 April 2011.\nThe Kagera Aquatic Zone's Management Plan issued in 2011 aims to improve management of the lakes and marshlands, and of the vegetation in the Murehe Forest area.\nLake Mwungere is considered an Integral Zone under this plan, which includes lake Gacamirina and Lake Nagitamo, and marshlands in the secondary valleys of the Akanyaru River. \nHuman influence should be excluded from the zone by a 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) belt to protect the natural species.\n",
    "\nAnti-M\u0101ori sentiment, broadly defined, is the dislike, distrust, discrimination, and racism directed against M\u0101ori people as an ethnicity and M\u0101ori culture. Various scholars have characterised anti-M\u0101ori sentiment as stemming from the colonisation of New Zealand by the British Empire.\nAssimilationist policies pursued by successive early New Zealand governments were all marked by anti-M\u0101ori sentiment, often justified through false claims M\u0101ori were \"dying out\". Anti-M\u0101ori sentiment developed as views of M\u0101ori among P\u0101keh\u0101 evolved, from the earliest notions of \"noble savages\" to 20th-century stereotypes of M\u0101ori as being fat, lazy, dirty, happy-go-lucky and unintelligent, or as criminals. Although racial segregation was never legally sanctioned in New Zealand, some towns and cities with P\u0101keh\u0101 and Asian pluralities practised it anyway until the 1960s. Anti-M\u0101ori bias in the media is well-documented and extensive. In 2020, media giant Stuff, which owns the Dominion Post and The Press, formally apologised for anti-M\u0101ori coverage in its newspapers dating back 160 years.\nIn the 21st century, anti-M\u0101ori sentiment has become more prominent and widely alleged as M\u0101ori culture has become more revitalised in public life, and M\u0101ori issues of greater concern among non-M\u0101ori. As of the 2023 census, one in five New Zealanders are of M\u0101ori descent. The 2004 Foreshore and Seabed controversy led to a resurgence of the M\u0101ori protest movement, which in turn was used by the political right to challenge tino rangatiratanga, or M\u0101ori sovereignty, as illegitimate or racist in itself. Such movements include Hobson's Pledge, an anti-Treatyist lobby group founded by former National Party leader Don Brash to oppose M\u0101ori treaty settlements and affirmative action, as well as Tross Publishing, Whale Oil, and elements of the ACT New Zealand political party. This is part of a wider trend against the Waitangi Tribunal and increased M\u0101ori political agency and biculturalism, including tropes of \"M\u0101ori privilege\", and a \"grievance industry\". Other examples include a wider backlash towards M\u0101ori language revitalisation, alleged \"Maorification\" of P\u0101keh\u0101 societal norms, and co-governance initiatives seeking to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi. A rise in anti-M\u0101ori sentiment, particularly against M\u0101ori women, has been reported since the 2023 New Zealand general election.\nThere are also marginal extremist groups, such as the defunct New Zealand National Front and Action Zealandia, who are white nationalist in character and deny M\u0101ori indigeneity.\nHistory\nAnti-M\u0101ori sentiment originated with the arrival of Europeans. As New Zealand transitioned from a collection of self-governing M\u0101ori polities to a British colonial possession and then self-governing country, anti-M\u0101ori attitudes were soon present in both administration and among P\u0101keh\u0101 (European New Zealanders). Although M\u0101ori are well regarded in popular culture as having been treated better than other indigenous people, anti-M\u0101ori sentiment has been a constant fixture of New Zealand society since colonisation.\nDenigration of M\u0101ori law and customs\nArguably the first anti-M\u0101ori policies were enacted by the colonial government (hereafter 'the Crown') to prevent the realisation of tino rangatiratanga (absolute sovereignty) and M\u0101ori law, the \"complex system of customary laws\" upon which M\u0101ori society operated. One of the M\u0101ori laws which the Crown sought to undermine and replace was the principle of collective ownership of land. The first efforts to circumvent M\u0101ori law regarding ownership was the pre-emption clause in Article Two of the Treaty of Waitangi. This gave the Crown the right of first refusal, to prevent the sale of M\u0101ori land to anyone other than the Crown. This was justified by British officials as necessary to protect Maori interests in land dealings with settlers and other colonial powers, such as France. Instead, pre-emption became a cornerstone in undermining M\u0101ori culture and law to achieve substantive British sovereignty. This was especially so in the \"golden age of M\u0101ori enterprise\", the period in which M\u0101ori outnumbered the first P\u0101keh\u0101, controlled the economy, and were generally in a position of strength.\nM\u0101ori were also discriminated against in suffrage. Although the M\u0101ori version of the Treaty of Waitangi gave the Crown the right to govern British settlers, M\u0101ori who wanted to partake in the earliest New Zealand democracy were largely shunned due to the land-ownership franchise, which restricted the right to vote to men aged 21 and over who owned property worth least 25 pounds. Since most M\u0101ori land was communally owned, very few M\u0101ori had the right to vote. This changed in 1867, when the M\u0101ori seats were established, but there were only 4, when M\u0101ori were entitled by population quota to 14 or 16. M\u0101ori were prevented from switching between the M\u0101ori and General electoral rolls until the 1980s, meaning they were chronically underrepresented for more than a century.\nThe Native La",
    "Early Zionist leader (1855\u20131918)\nYehoshua Barzilai-Eisenstadt (August 20, 1855 \u2013 May 2, 1918) was an early Zionist leader and writer. He was one of the founders of the covert B'nei Moshe organization, and a leader of the Hovevei Zion movement.\nYehoshua Barzillai\nBiography\nBarzillai was born in Belarus, then part of the Russian Empire, to a rabbinical family. At a young age, he became one of the first members of Hovevei Zion.\nIn 1881, he immigrated to Ottoman Palestine but returned to Russia a year later. There, he co-founded the secret organization B'nei Moshe, which aimed to establish leaders in Am Yisrael and the realization of its political resurrection in the Land of Israel.\nIn 1890, Barzilai returned to Ottoman Palestine with the founding members of B'nei Moshe. He worked at the Anglo-Palestine Bank (Bank Leumi), from which he was dismissed for prioritizing Zionist principles over strict commercial caution. He also served as secretary for Hovevei Zion in Jaffa, traveling extensively across the new settlements in the Land of Israel and becoming a key contact for pioneers' inquiries. From 1894 to 1895, he was the head librarian at Beit Ariela. Shortly after returning to Israel, he moved to Jerusalem.\nBarzilai was a prolific poet and writer, known for his romantic short stories about life in the Land of Israel, many of which were published in Eliezer Ben-Yehuda's newspaper, HaZvi. He also published a magazine, \"Letters from the Land of Israel,\" which was distributed among Bnei Moshe members in Russia from 1893 to 1895. He often dated his letters according to the Jewish calendar and used pen names such as \"Beit Halevi\" and \"Bar-Lee\".\nBarzilai at the HeHalutz garden plot with the American Delegation headed by Henry Morgenthau Sr. (Standing, first row from the bottom, third from the left)\nHe was a close friend and ally of Menachem Ussishkin, supporting him in his opposition to the Uganda Program, resisting Baron Edmond James de Rothschild\u2019s interventions in the colonies, advocating for the elevation of Jerusalem's significance in Zionist thought, and promoting the adoption of Hebrew as an official national language. His correspondence with Ussishkin, spanning many years, provides a crucial record of the crises and struggles faced during the first wave of immigration, primarily from 1900 to 1911.\nTogether with Ussishkin, he founded the \"Hovevei Jerusalem\" association to promote Jewish settlement in Jerusalem, collaborating with figures such as Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, Kadish Silman, David Yellin, Boris Schatz, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, and Rachel Yanait Ben-Zvi, among others.\nHe also conducted research on the social composition of Jerusalem's population at the time and worked to improve living conditions through employment initiatives.\nStatue of Barzilai at the Histadrut building in Tel Aviv\nAmong his many accomplishments was co-founding the Rehavia Gymnasium in Jerusalem, Israel's first modern high school.\nDeath\nDuring World War I, like many early immigrants, he was forced to leave the country and relocated to Switzerland, where he died in 1918. Seven years later, his remains were interred on the Mount of Olives.\n",
    "\nKatharina \"Katja\" Paryla (25 January 1940 \u2013 25 August 2013) was a German actress, stage director and theatre director. She was known especially for her work on stage, including at the Deutsches Theater Berlin where she often played leading roles with her partner Alexander Lang directing, including the title roles of Goethe's Iphigenie auf Tauris and Medea by Euripides, and Alice in Strindberg's Totentanz.\nLife and career\nParyla was born in Z\u00fcrich on 25 January 1940, the daughter of the actor and stage director Emil Paryla\u00a0 and his wife Selly, an actress. Her father adopted his mother's surname St\u00f6hr to be not confused with his famous brother Karl Paryla. Her parents had emigrated from Germany under the Nazi regime to Switzerland in 1938. The family moved to Vienna in 1946. When the Neues Theater in der Scala\u00a0 where her father was engaged closed in 1956 due to the Brecht boycott in Vienna, and he found no other jobs in Austria, they moved to East Berlin.\nParyla first studied fashion design at the Wei\u00dfensee Academy of Art Berlin, graduating with an excellent diploma. She then studied acting at the Staatliche Schauspielschule Berlin (later:  Ernst Busch Academy of Dramatic Arts, in Berlin-Sch\u00f6neweide from 1961 to 1963. She made her stage debut, alongside her father, at Deutsches Theater Berlin as Milena Andertschowa in Old\u0159ich Dan\u011bk's Die Hochzeit des Heiratsschwindlers. Wolfgang Heinz won her in 1963 to the Volksb\u00fchne in Berlin, and Kurt Veth\u00a0 in 1967 to the Maxim-Gorki-Theater.\nFrom the late 1960s, Paryla also played in film and television.

It is named in honor of General Fran\u00e7ois Blanchot de Verly (1735\u20131807), who was a governor of Senegal. It is one of the pioneering institutions of the colonial era and, like Lyc\u00e9e Faidherbe, was a breeding ground for leaders in French West Africa (AOF). Many students, after completing their education, joined the William Ponty Normal School to become teachers. Numerous notable figures in Senegal's political, religious, and cultural scenes, such as Mady Cissokho, Cheikh Hamidou Kane, Mamadou Dia, Madior Ciss\u00e9, M\u00e9doune Fall, Ousmane Soc\u00e9 Diop, Assane Seck, Diaraf Diouf, and Ibrahima Diallo, are alumni.\nHistory\nIn Saint-Louis, the institution succeeded the School for Sons of Chiefs and Interpreters, which itself was derived from the \u00c9cole des otages founded by Louis Faidherbe in 1855.\nThe school opened in Saint-Louis in 1916. It included several sections. Besides the standard curriculum aimed at future teaching monitors, other courses were designed to train public writers, typists, accountants, postal and telegraph employees, nurses, and manual and agricultural workers.\nIn 1931, \u00c9cole Blanchot had 180 students.\nIn 1952, EPS Blanchot was renamed Coll\u00e8ge Blanchot.\nIn 1963, its premises were taken over by Lyc\u00e9e Ameth Fall.\nNotes and references\n^ J.

    "1989 studio album by the Kinsey Report\nMidnight Drive is the second album by the American band the Kinsey Report, released in 1989. The band supported the album with a North American tour. At the time of its release, Midnight Drive was one of Alligator Records' best selling albums. Issues with patriarch Big Daddy Kinsey, among other problems, led to changes in the Kinsey Report's lineup on subsequent albums.\nProduction\nMidnight Drive was produced by Bruce Iglauer, Donald Kinsey, and the band. The Kinsey Report incorporated more of a rock and funk sound on the album. They wrote eight of its ten songs. \"Nowhere to Go, Nothing to Lose\" is about a steel worker who loses his job due to automation. \"Free South Africa\", an anti-apartheid song, reflected Donald Kinsey's admiration for the hopeful messages in many blues and reggae songs. \"River's Invitation\" is a cover of the Percy Mayfield song.\nCritical reception\nThe Chicago Tribune wrote that \"Donald Kinsey, without benefit of special effects, puts on a guitar clinic on the Report's second album that should give pause to better-known gunslingers such as Eddie Van Halen and Stevie Ray Vaughan.\" Newsday concluded that \"the title track, a barrelling number adorned with tight, sharp guitar figures, and 'See Her Again', with its similar power, show what the Kinsey Brothers are made of: blues with rock influences (particularly Jimi Hendrix for the guitarists), not a blues-influenced rock band.\" The Washington Post opined that \"most of the songs seem to offer little more than a flimsy excuse to wail on guitar.\"\nThe St. Petersburg Times praised Donald Kinsey and stated that \"not since Jimi Hendrix has a black guitarist so effectively blended elements of blues and rock.\" The Edmonton Journal said that \"Kinsey approaches the blues from a devil-may-care stand point\u2014we're almost talking brash, '60s British era Chicken Shack, or forsooth, Fleetwood Mac.\" The Daily Herald determined that Midnight Drive is \"an attempt to take the blues form one solid step farther, and, in doing that, it displays smashing originality and stays close the basics, too.\"\nTrack listing\n",
    "Australian game quiz show\nHard Quiz Kids is an Australian television comedy children's quiz show which premiered on  ABC Family on 8 June 2024. Hosted by Tom Gleeson, the show is a spin-off of the quiz show Hard Quiz, also hosted by Gleeson. It is filmed at the ABC Melbourne studios in Southbank in front of a studio audience. Contestants are aged from 10 to 13 years old, although some 14-year-olds participated.\nFormat\nEach episode of Hard Quiz Kids features four contestants, each of whom has selected a specialist subject area. No subject area (including those selected in \"Tom's Round\") may be used more than once. Each correct answer is worth 5 points, while each wrong answer costs 5 points.\nExpert Round\nThe contestants, in turn, each receive five questions regarding their specialist subject areas. They must buzz in to respond and are locked out of a question if they got it wrong or took too long to give an answer, giving the other players a chance to answer. A contestant may attempt to answer a question from another contestant's subject area. This is known as \"The Steal\". If a Steal is successful, the contestant receives 10 points but will only lose 5 points for an incorrect Steal attempt.\nTom's Round\nThe contestants, using their monitors, lock in their answers to each of the five multiple-choice questions from a subject Gleeson has chosen in advance. A selected response must be locked in by pressing the red buzzer. Each question has 4 options except for the last question, which has 6 options and is played for double points (10 points for a right answer). The lowest scorer at the end of this round is out of the game, with their podium now displaying the words \"Too Soft\".\nThe People's Round (Against the Clock)\nIn this round, general knowledge questions are given out for a rather vague time limit (between 35 and over 90 seconds, depending on the episode). The contestants, again, buzz in to respond. The lowest scorer when time expires is also out of the game.\nTiebreaker: Hard-Off\nIn the event of a tie for lowest scorer when an elimination is required, the tie is broken with a \"hard-off\", where Gleeson presents two options for a given question (often pertaining to the relative difficulty of two given tasks or physical hardness of two materials), which the first contestant to buzz in then answers. If the answering contestant chooses correctly, the other contestant is eliminated and vice versa if the answer given is incorrect.\nWhen more than two contestants play a hard-off, multiple questions can be played. If a contestant answers correctly, they are safe from elimination and the hard-off continues until only one contestant is not safe. If a contestant answers incorrectly, they are eliminated and all other contestant in the hard-off become safe.\nFinal round: Hard Quiz (Head to Head)\nThe final two contestants alternate answering questions regarding their chosen subject area in a best of five penalty shootout-style format with the winner receiving a trophy \u2013 the limited-edition big brass mug, or in the case of the \"Battle of The Duds\" episodes, the aforementioned big brass mug with a hole in the bottom. The contestant also gets to sign off the show with the catchphrase \"Thanks for playing, hard.\"\nIf the final two contestants have got the same amount of correct answers after five questions, an extra question will be asked to each contestant on their specialty subject.\nTom's Tiebreaker\nAfter the extra questions and if the players are still tied, one numerical question will be asked on Tom's specialty subject of the day. Each contestant will be required to guess the correct answer, starting with the player that got the first question during the final round, and the closer of the two wins the show.\nSeries overview\nEpisodes\nSeries 1\nNames in Bold are the winners\n",
    "Motor car race\nThe 2024 Coke Zero Sugar 400 is an upcoming NASCAR Cup Series race held on August 24, 2024, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida on the 2.5-mile (4.0\u00a0km) superspeedway, it is the 25th race of the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series season.\nReport\nBackground\nDaytona International Speedway, the site of the race.\nThe race was held at Daytona International Speedway, a race track located in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States. Since opening in 1959, the track is the home of the Daytona 500, the most prestigious race in NASCAR. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosts races of ARCA, AMA Superbike, USCC, SCCA, and Motocross. It features multiple layouts including the primary 2.5 miles (4.0\u00a0km) high speed tri-oval, a 3.56 miles (5.73\u00a0km) sports car course, a 2.95 miles (4.75\u00a0km) motorcycle course, and a .25 miles (0.40\u00a0km) karting and motorcycle flat-track. The track's 180-acre (73\u00a0ha) infield includes the 29-acre (12\u00a0ha) Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built in 1959 by NASCAR founder William \"Bill\" France, Sr. to host racing held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course. His banked design permitted higher speeds and gave fans a better view of the cars. Lights were installed around the track in 1998 and today, it is the third-largest single lit outdoor sports facility. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004 and the track repaved twice \u2014 in 1978 and in 2010.\nOn January 22, 2013, the track unveiled artist depictions of a renovated speedway. On July 5 of that year, ground was broken for a project that would remove the backstretch seating and completely redevelop the frontstretch seating. The renovation to the speedway is being worked on by Rossetti Architects. The project, named \"Daytona Rising\", was completed in January 2016, and it cost US $400 million, placing emphasis on improving fan experience with five expanded and redesigned fan entrances (called \"injectors\") as well as wider and more comfortable seating with more restrooms and concession stands. After the renovations, the track's grandstands include 101,000 permanent seats with the ability to increase permanent seating to 125,000. The project was completed before the start of Speedweeks.\nEntry list\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\nMedia\nTelevision\nNBC Sports will cover the race on the television side. Rick Allen, 2000 Coke Zero 400 winner Jeff Burton, Steve Letarte and seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson will call the race from the broadcast booth. Reporters TBA will handle the pit road duties from pit lane.\nRadio\nMRN will have the radio call for the race, which will also be simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. Alex Hayden, Jeff Striegle, and 1989 NASCAR Cup Series Champion Rusty Wallace will call the action for MRN when the field races thru the front straightaway.

    "Beinese teacher\nDat\u00e9 Atavito Barnab\u00e9-Akayi (born September 24, 1978) is a Beninese teacher and writer, known for his plays and poetry.\nEarly life and education\nHe grew up in Kpalim\u00e9. He is his mother's only child, but has several siblings on his father's side.\nHe showed a strong interest in reading early on, even though he was not particularly passionate about his studies. Thanks to his maternal uncle, aunt, and other relatives who took him under their wing, he completed his studies successfully and enrolled at the University of Abomey-Calavi in the Department of Modern Literature. After a brief career in journalism, where he handled the culture section of several newspapers, he became a high school and college teacher.\nHe is the author of plays and poetry.\nLiterary work\nIn 2010, he came to public attention with his collection of two plays, Amour en infraction and Les confessions du PR (Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2010). While the first play openly discusses an unlikely love affair between a teacher and her student, the second portrays the figure of an African head of state, guilty of mismanagement and humiliating the First Lady, his wife, through his antics and recurrent infidelities. Overwhelmed and detested, he appears more pitiable than dangerous, seeking hypothetical redemption by confessing to a priest. The play addresses power, its intoxicating effects, and the inconsistencies it engenders.\nThe same year, another play, Quand Dieu a faim (Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2010), was published. Here, the text addresses the controversial theme of homosexuality. Why is the sexual orientation of certain citizens subject to so much condemnation? If homosexuality is part of the diversity of practices and is a personal choice, the author concludes, people should be tolerant, especially when claiming to build a society that respects human rights.\nIn 2011, L\u2019Affaire Bissi, a collection of five short stories, was published by Ruisseaux d'Afrique. Social constraints and strange practices poisoning daily life are the backdrop for the texts in this collection, written simply but full of sensitivity and seriousness. The author is prolific; he is the only Beninese writer to have published five works in recent years.\nIt is mainly in poetry that this writer's talent shines. Dat\u00e9 Atavito Barnab\u00e9-Akayi's poetry is strong, dense, and constructed like a continuous flow of words from an inexhaustible source. The flow of words seems unstoppable, carrying with it all the emotions and feelings of the poet.\nThis is not about the other, but about oneself, even if the other \u2013 depicted as a child, a beloved woman, close or distant \u2013 is related to oneself in its various nuances. After the trilogy Noire comme la ros\u00e9e, Tristesse ma ma\u00eetresse (Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2010), and Solitude mon S\u2026 (Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2012), Dat\u00e9 explores another aspect of his \"self\" through Tes l\u00e8vres o\u00f9 j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 la nuit. Imonl\u00e8 158 (Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2014). The tone here is much more festive, reflecting a newfound inner balance provoked by the presence of the lover, this long-sought and sublimated Eve, whose proximity calls for an explosion of the senses.\nThe author delivers a powerful voice, playing endlessly with a phrasing without punctuation. In fact, without stating it, he invites the reader to infuse the text with their own rhythm, creating breaks, adding commas and periods, in short, making the reader a poet. For, however one approaches this text, unexpected meanings emerge, new ideas appear, offering the reader a rich approach to the work in its multiple facets. Let another poet, Sophie Heidi Kam, a Burkinabe author, express her appreciation: the poetry, that of Dat\u00e9 reassures me that I am not alone, and that what I feel and write in poetry is not just the outpouring of an isolated soul in the grip of delirium. This is the charm, the beauty, and the tragic aspect of his poetry: In poetry, there is no room for deceit when you allow the heart to open up and speak..\nTheatre\nAmour en infraction and Les confessions du PR, Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2010.\nQuand Dieu a faim..., Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2010.\nLes confessions du PR, followed by Amour en infraction and Quand Dieu a faim..., Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2010.\nPoetry\nNoire comme la ros\u00e9e, Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2011.\nTristesse ma ma\u00eetresse, Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2011.\nSolitude mon S, Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2012.\nTes l\u00e8vres o\u00f9 j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 la nuit.

    "\n4C +72.26 known as NAME TX J1908+7220, is a radio galaxy located in the constellation Draco. At the redshift of 3.53, the galaxy is located roughly 11.5 billion light-years from Earth.\nCharacteristics\n4C +72.26 is one of the high redshift powerful radio galaxies. An interacting pair of two vigorous starburst galaxies separated by \u223c1300 \u00b1 200\u00a0km s\u22121 in velocity, 4C +72.26 is known to have tight locus following in the K-band Hubble diagram, suggesting it as a luminous (\u223c3L*) galaxy with stellar populations forming rapidly at a very high redshift and such, evolved passively.\n4C +72.26 is a massive galaxy lying inside the center of a galaxy cluster where galaxy formation is regulated and through growth by heating the intracluster medium. Energy that is released from the continued accretion of material, is then fueled towards its central supermassive black hole.\nThe molecular gas is known to end up between two colliding galaxies which displays absorption line profiles like P Cygni, while the active galactic nucleus host shows Ly\u03b1 emission that indicative of a galaxy-wide \u2018superwind\u2019. Moreover, the host is found to have a luminous highly ionized outflow. Despite showing a strong massive starburst, the ultraviolet-mid-infrared spectral energy distribution in 4C +72.26 is found to have a pre-existing stellar population that comprises ~1012 Msolar of stellar mass, with further ~2 per cent contributed by the current burst. This suggests that 4C +72.26 has assembled most of its final stellar mass.\n4C +72.26 is classfied as a broad absorption-line radio galaxy with strong mid-infrared continua observed through spectrograph observations from Spitzer Telescope, according to research conducted by Dey in 1999, similar to those of broad absorption-line quasars with C IV trough extending bluewards to \u223c7000\u00a0km s\u22121.\nWith an upper spectrum appearing similar to the long-slit spectrum that is presented, the galaxy also have wavelength coverage up to \u223c8400 \u00c5. Besides the narrow emission lines of Ly\u03b1 and He II, several deep broad absorption troughs are seen, with sharper absorption features shortward of the predicted wavelengths that is O I1302 and C II1335 similar to 4C +41.17 and NGC 1741, a star-forming galaxy.\n",
    "\nThe 1999 Northern Mariana Islands general election was held on Saturday, 6 November 1999. Voters in the Northern Mariana Islands voted for 3 seats in the Northern Mariana Islands Senate, all eighteen seats in the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives, seats for the municipal council, and seats for the board of education, and a judge. There were also 4 other legislative initiatives, 2 of which were voted on by all CNMI voters, while 1 was voted on only by Rota voters and 1 only by Tinian voters.\nThe 1999 elections marked the first time a third party lawmaker was elected in the Northern Mariana Islands, with the newly formed Reform Party achieving a \"stunning upset and defeat of formidable incumbent Senator Juan P. Tenorio (Morgen) by newcomer Ramon \"Kumoi\" Santos Deleon Guerrero.\"\nBackground\nThe 1999 elections takes place in the aftermath of the Japanese asset price bubble and the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which saw as many as 2,000 businesses in the CNMI close down, severely affecting the ruling incumbent Republican party. Tourism has been significantly negatively affected and austerity measures have began to pressure the population as the economy has turned negative since Governor Pedro Pangelinan Tenorio took office. The Asian financial crisis severely affected the CNMI's main tourist market of East Asia, including South Korea and Japan, the latter also being a key investor in the CNMI since the implementation of the Plaza Accords in 1986 which saw the Japanese investing their surplus of dollars throughout the world. Throughout the period of the Japanese asset price bubble, from 1986 to 1991, \"It has been estimated that from 3/4 to one billion dollars in foreign investment flowed into the Commonwealth during the short period of about six years\u2014most of it Japanese.\" The bursting of this price bubble saw Japanese investment in the CNMI dry up and severely impacted the Commonwealth. Before and during this period of economic turmoil, the CNMI Legislature potentially exacerbated the economic situation by implementing policies that hindered businesses and frequently changed laws and regulations to the detriment and irritation of businesses.\nThis election also marks the year that The Reform Party was founded by former Governor Froilan C. Tenorio, who claimed to be disgruntled and tired of the disunity showed by his former political affiliation, the Democrats.\nNorthern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature\nResults summary\nSenate\nThe Northern Mariana Islands Senate is the upper house of the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature, consisting of nine senators representing three senatorial districts (Saipan & the Northern Islands, Tinian & Aguijan, and Rota), each a Multi-member district with three senators. three seats in the Northern Mariana Islands Senate were up for the 1999 election.\nHouse of Representatives\nThe Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives is the lower house of the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature.

    "\nVia XX Settembre is one of the main thoroughfares in the center of Genoa, Italy, located within the San Vincenzo district. It is slightly less than a kilometer long.\nLocation\nIt runs east\u2013west and, along with Corso Italia - the promenade along the seafront - is one of the main streets for strolling and shopping in the city, located in the city center. It traverses the two central districts of Portoria (the first stretch, with arcades, from Piazza De Ferrari to the Monumental Bridge) and San Vincenzo (from the Monumental Bridge to the junction with Via Cadorna near Piazza della Vittoria).\nIt intersects with numerous streets along its length, some of which were pedestrianized during the renovation work for the G8 Summit in 2001, and is rich with elegant shops. It serves as a link between the eastern part of the city, which faces east of the Bisagno river, and the western part developed beyond Largo della Zecca, towards Principe. In particular, it connects Piazza della Vittoria to Piazza De Ferrari, two of the city's major squares.\nAlmost exclusively lined with shops and city offices, Via XX Settembre slopes slightly upwards towards the west (although vehicle traffic flows in the opposite direction) and is adorned with some of the city's most imposing buildings; in the upper part of the street, a series of long arcades stretch along both sides, reaching the entrances of the Teatro Carlo Felice on the right side.\nAlong Via XX Settembre are some of the most prestigious shops and elegant caf\u00e9s. Until the 1980s, the street was also rich in cinemas and theaters (such as Cinema Olimpia and Teatro Margherita), making it nationally known as \"the street of cinemas\".\nHistory\nThe central area corresponding to Via Giulia, Via della Consolazione, and Via Porta Pia, map published in 1886\nThe central area corresponding to Via Giulia, Via della Consolazione, and Via Porta Pia, map published in 1906, after the construction of Via XX Settembre.\nVia XX Settembre in 1907, during a parade\nThe operations of removing the original stone paving of the street, in 1929\nIn the background: Piazza della Vittoria and Corte Lambruschini\nThe Monumental Bridge seen from the square of the Church of Santo Stefano. Note the net underneath for renovation works\nOne of the mosaics under the arcades\nThe street was built in the last decade of the 19th century, rectifying and expanding the path of Via Giulia and Via della Consolazione, to create a new route towards the east, which until then had inadequate outlets for the city's urban expansion. The name of the new street was the subject of heated discussions at the time, until the desire of many citizens to have the historic date of the Capture of Rome recognized prevailed.\nThe street was strongly advocated by Mayor Andrea Podest\u00e0, but opposed by the resident population because building it required demolishing houses and shops. Especially opposed were the religious of the Church of the Remedy, expropriated to make way for the artery. Among the other necessary demolitions was the one, hindered by the government, of the Sant'Andrea prisons.\nThe stretch of road affecting the district of San Vincenzo (from the Monumental Bridge to Via Fiume), while not having the sumptuous appearance of the part between Piazza De Ferrari and the Monumental Bridge, characterized by high arcades with Venetian flooring, is equally filled with elegant palaces and shops, making the street one of the city's most frequented destinations for shopping and strolling. At the time of its opening, the street, wide, straight, and lined with buildings of unusual height for the times, more similar to the sumptuous Via Giuseppe Garibaldi of the Renaissance period, represented a novelty for the area, which until then had narrower streets and characteristic alleyways. The competition for the construction of the new street was announced in 1883, after nearly twenty years of debate, and only in 1887 was the project by Cesare Gamba approved. Work began in 1892. The lower part was first completed, with the reorganization of the former Via della Consolazione, finished the following year; the street was inaugurated on January 18, 1896. The construction of the various buildings facing the street would be completed only in 1913. All pre-existing buildings, except for the Church of the Consolation and the attached convent, were demolished and replaced by new buildings, constructed for the first time in Genoa in reinforced concrete.\nThe street was built on the route of the previous via Giulia, for the stretch from Piazza De Ferrari (then Piazza San Domenico, named after the homonymous church no longer existing) to the Monumental Bridge, and Via della Consolazione, for the stretch beyond the Monumental Bridge to Porta Pila. A project to expand via Giulia (a road dating back to the 17th century and modified several times to improve its accessibility for carts and carriages) had already been approved in 1840, but the practice was then blocked due to ap",

    "American physician\nJosette Marie Mondanaro (May 21, 1945 \u2013 December 25, 2002) was an American physician. As an expert on addiction, she served as head of the Division of Substance Abuse, part of the California Department of Health, during the Jerry Brown administration in the mid-1970s.\nEarly life and education\nMondanaro was born in New York City and raised in Blue Point, New York, the daughter of Anthony Mondanaro and Alice Celentano Mondanaro. Her father was a butcher, and her mother worked in a department store. She graduated from Syracuse University in 1967, with a bachelor's degree in zoology, and gained her medical training at Upstate Medical College in 1971. She completed a residency at Children's Hospital of San Francisco.\nCareer\nIn 1976, Mondanaro was appointed head of the Division of Substance Abuse in the California Department of Health. Despite strong performance, she was fired from this position in late 1977, when she used explicit language in a personal letter written on official state letterhead. Mondanaro and others appealed the decision, based on her belief that she was fired because she was a lesbian, and because some state officials considered that a political liability. Jerry Brown denied that her sexuality was a factor in the decision, in unprecedented testimony before the Personnel Board. She was ordered reinstated after hearings, and continued working for the State of California for a time, as a maternal and child health consultant in the Health Services Department.\nAfter leaving state government, Mondanaro ran a medical clinic in Santa Cruz, treated women with drug dependencies, and taught at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In 1984, she spoke about her work as a guest on The Phil Donahue Show. In 1985, she planned a move to Laguna Beach, to open a treatment program for teens. She also became involved in HIV/AIDS prevention work among women at risk.

    "American journalist (1816\u20131879)\nLawrence Augustus Gobright or Lawrence A. Gobright (1816\u20131879) was an American journalist. He is noted for his work as a Washington correspondent for the Associated Press. Aside from his work as a reporter for other newspapers, he was also a part-owner and editor of the Washington Evening Star. Gobright had also published several books, including Recollections of Men and Things, Jack and Jill, and For Old and Young.\nBiography\nGobright was born on 22 May 1816 in Baltimore, Maryland. He learned the printing trade in the city. He was cited as the editor of the Batavia Ohio Sun, which was known as Martin Van Buren campaign newspaper. After this stint, he moved to Washington, D.C., where he reported on the Washington beat for the Baltimore Clipper and other newspapers. By 1845, he was cited as one of the editors of the Washington Daily Bee, a penny paper. For many years, he was also the owner and editor of the Washington Star. He was the Washington agent of the Associated Press from 1848 until 1878.\nDuring the Civil War, his peers called him \u201cPop\u201d and \u201cFather Gobright\u201d due to his gray hair. Golbright had worked with President Abraham Lincoln, who sometimes invited him to accompany him. The President provided him with news although the dispatches did not attribute anything to the source. When Lincoln received, for instance, a report that General Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s army was defeated near Vicksburg, Mississippi, Gobright was present. The President was reportedly agitated and forbade the reporter to publish the news. Gobright was said to have reminded him that \u201cmore than half of the war rumors are false.\u201d The report proved to be erroneous.\nGobright was noted for his nonpartisan reporting. In a congressional hearing, he explained: \u201cMy business is to communicate facts\u2026 My dispatches are sent to papers for all manner of politics and the editors say they are able to make their own comments upon the facts which are sent to them.\u201d He was also known for his close links with many politicians. It is claimed that younger reporters accused him of being a \u201cgovernment agent\u201d.\nLincoln assassination\nOne of the most notable moments in Gobright\u2019s career was his reporting of the Abraham Lincoln assassination. An account described the event on April 14, 1865, when Gobright had just finished an article about General Grant\u2019s absence at a Ford\u2019s Theatre performance. He was said to be expecting a slow night, reviewing minor news article to be dispatched to the Associated Press in New York. A friend brought in the news of Lincoln\u2019s assassination and he promptly telegraphed to his subscribers the following:\nWASHINGTON, APRIL 14, 1865TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: THE PRESIDENT WAS SHOT IN A THEATER TONIGHT AND PERHAPS MORTALLY WOUNDED.\nGobright had no other details about the incident when this lead was dispatched. He would file a more detailed news for the dailies later. Later, many historians cited his accounts of the assassination. Gobright also testified before the military tribunal that heard the case of Dr. Samuel Mudd, an alleged Lincoln assassination conspirator. Scholars note the innovations to his reporting after the assassination, which included the use of the lead and the inverted pyramid structure. Prior to this, news reporting followed the chronological format.\nRetirement\nGobright\u2019s retirement from Associated Press was recorded in detail. By early 1878, dissatisfaction of his work emerged due to the perception that he was incapable of meeting the post-Civil War demands for news that addressed the wider spectrum of regional interests and journalistic tastes. The Associated Press tried to remedy the situation by hiring two additional reporters at the news outlet\u2019s Washington Bureau, \u201cHayes and Divine, the two best reporters in Washington\u201d. Problems persisted and sometime in June 1878, Walter Polk Phillips was sent to Washington to replace Gobright.\nGobright died on May 22, 1879, at Washington, D.C.\nPublications\nMen and Things in Washington During the Third of a Century is considered to be Gobright\u2019s best known book.\nRecollections of Men and Things at Washington During the Third of a Century (1869)\nJack and Jill (1873)\nFor Old and Young (1873)\nEchoes of Childhood: Old Friends in New Costumes from the Risen and Rising Generation (1879)\n",
    "An example of Sarir scripture By Korosh Ghazomorad\nSarir script is a type of Persian calligraphy, which was created by Korosh Ghazimorad by looking at Shekasteh Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq, Chinese script and Gothic script, and was introduced in 2013.\nOrigin and Evolution\nIn February 2014, Korosh Ghazimorad, after 7 years of study and efforts, unveiled this script for the first time by setting up an exhibition in the gallery of \"Ostad Morteza Momayez\", Iran's Artist House, in collaboration with Bahram Kalhornia, by exposing 54 works.\nAlso, various exhibitions were held in different countries to introduce this script. in 2014, this script was displayed in the city of Beirut, Lebanon.\nAttributes\nSarir, which is designed based on the usual Iranian calligraphy methods and styles, as the first script that is against the angle of the usual calligraphy and is also the first script that is written in two ways, thin and bold.\nIn the bold font, the basis of the design is based on the classical Shekasteh Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq, especially the classic Shekasteh Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq, and the thin font is based on the English cursive font and is designed with a poetic look to that font.\nSarir was created by studying the form and space and Iranian calligraphy methods, especially classical Shekasteh Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script, Chinese script, and Gothic script. Sarir can easily overcome some limitations of traditional Iranian calligraphy because in this new way of calligraphy, all angles of the pen can be used. For the first time in Iranian calligraphy, in the Sarir style pen, the back of the calligraphy pen and the opposite angle of the usual calligraphy has been used.\nBahram Kalharnia says about Sarir: \"You can write with this pen and have exclusive writings in the old way. This pen has a history and contains all the historical and Iranian values, like Shekasteh Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq and Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq.\nKorosh Ghazimorad said about the use of the opposite angle of the pen: \"One of the important reasons why I used this angle was that I know Gothic, Chinese, and Thuluth calligraphy, and I know that these styles can have points of connection and commonality. and in Gothic and Latin styles, the opposite angle of the pen is used well, and I tried to use this angle for Persian script.\nSources\n^ \"\u062a\u062c\u0631\u0628\u0647 7 \u0633\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0647\u0646\u0631\u0645\u0646\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u0637\u0631\u0627\u062d\u06cc \u062e\u0637 \"\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0631\" \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u062f\u0631\u0622\u0645\u062f\".

    "\nAbell 1942 BCG (short for Abell 1942 Brightest Cluster Galaxy), also known as PGC 1256558, is a massive elliptical galaxy of type-cD residing as the brightest cluster galaxy of the Abell 1942 galaxy cluster, located in the constellation Virgo. With a redshift of 0.224, the galaxy is located nearly 2.7 billion light-years away from Earth.\nCharacteristics\nAbell 1942 BCG is one of the largest galaxies with a diameter of 939,200 light-years across. A luminous red galaxy observed by Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the total stellar mass of the galaxy is estimated to be  ~3 \u00d7 1011 Msolar. It is also classfied as an active wide-angled tailed radio galaxy. With an astrophysical jet speed within of the range (0.3-0.7)c and a peaked spectrum source of between 1.4\u00a0GHz and 325 MHz, Abell 1942 BCG is found to be radio-luminous with values below 1022 WHz\u22121 at 1.4\u00a0GHz.\nMoreover, Abell 1942 BCG contains an extended radio source listed by researchers in the 408-MHz Molonglo Reference Catalogue and also Parkes Catalogue of radio sources. Its luminosity function is estimated to be frequencies of 400 and 2700\u00a0MHz.\nAbell 1942 BCG is aligned along its major axis towards its parent cluster. It has a large galactic halo displaying a light profile with surface brightness ranging from 27.5 mag arcsec-2 at 100 kpc to ~32 mag arcsec-2 at 700 kpc as observed through r-bands. Such of these light profiles in massive galaxies like Abell 1942 BCG tend to reach up to several hundreds of kilometers. Because Abell 1942 BCG has special properties, researchers theorized it might have been formed through the process of galactic cannibalism as the galaxy merges with its surrounding satellite galaxies thus increasing its luminosity. As merger process continues, the mass of Abell 1942 BCG is build-up while at the same time, the number of satellite galaxies reduces.\nThe star formation in Abell 1942 BCG, is estimated to contribute less mass friction and a stellar age of 200 Myr. Because the galaxy host's cluster has X-ray properties and the young star population, this strongly hints the star formation of Abell 1942 BCG is fueled by gas cooling out of the intracluster medium. As observed by Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), Spitzer Space Telescope, and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), researchers found the galaxy displays ultraviolet (38%) and mid-infrared emission (43%) from 8 to 160 \u03bcm, above as expected.\nAbell 1942\nThe galaxy cluster where Abell 1942 BCG is residing, is found be a rich cluster. As observed by researchers, they found it has a mean redshift value of z = 0.22513 \\pm 0.0008 and also a velocity dispersion sigma of = 908^{+147}_{-139} km/s. Through the analysis, they found the cluster is relaxed with no signs of remarkable features and a fair distribution of the X-ray emission traces.\nThey also found Abell 1942 has two possible optical substructures, seen at ~5 arcmin from the center towards the Northwest and the Southwest direction. However, they are not confirmed by the velocity field. The clumps are however, kinematically bound to the main structure of Abell 1942. Upon looking at the velocity dispersion through usage of the T_X-sigma scaling relation, they found the temperature is in good agreement with measured galaxies velocities.\nAccording to researchers conducting a photometric redshift analysis, they suggest the weak lensing signal observed at the south part of the cluster, is contributed to dark matter concentration by background sources, that are possibly distributed as a single filamentary structure. Thus, they could use limiting magnitude of H = 22, for detection of such clusters with appropriate mass that have comparable redshifts with the mean redshift of background sources.\n",

South Africa were reeling at 68/1 at one stage before being put under the backfoot by the Nepalese spinners. Lamichhane made a return to the Nepal side after clearing his visa issues and he drew the first blood into the match proceedings by extracting higher degree of turn and bounce on a relatively spin friendly pitch. South African batters were unable to cope up with the spin attack of Nepal and Reeza Hendricks top scored for South Africa with a 49 ball knock of 43 runs. Nepal in their run chase started the proceedings really well and they finished the powerplay on top by scoring 32 runs without losing any wickets. Tabraiz Shamsi provided the breakthroughs for South Africa by rattling Kushal Bhurtel for 13 runs and then Nepal captain Rohit Paudel was dismissed in the same over for nought. However, Aasif Sheikh pulled back things in favor of Nepal by playing a vital role with a knock of 42 in 49 deliveries. Nepal at one stage were looking well on course for a dramatic win when they were cruising with 82 runs for loss of 3 wickets inside 15 overs. Then the equation eventually came down with 18 runs needed off the last 3 overs. Sompal Kami eventually gave a glimmer of hope for Nepal when he smashed Anrich Nortje for a 105m six to bring down the equation needing 10 runs off 7 deliveries. Nepal then needed 8 runs to win in the last over. Gulsha Jha was batting on strike to face the last 6 deliveries bowled by Ottneil Baartman but he missed to put the bat on the ball in most of the deliveries and as a result Nepal was left needing 2 runs off 2 balls and then to chase 2 off the last delivery but Nepal batter Jha was ran out who was running towards the danger end to complete crucial single. South Africa eventually ran out Jha to complete a sensational win by one run to make it 4 out of 4 in their group stage.\nNepal vs Bangladesh\n \nNetherlands vs Sri Lanka\n \n",
    "\nHenry Morgan's raid on Lake Maracaibo, also known as the Sack of Maracaibo and the Battle of Lake Maracaibo, was a military event that took place between 16 March and 21 May 1669 during the latter stage of the Anglo-Spanish War. English privateers commanded by notable Buccaneer Henry Morgan launched an attack with the purpose of raiding Spanish towns along the coastline inside of Lake Maracaibo in the Spanish Province of Venezuela.\nAfter capturing and sacking the towns of Maracaibo and Gibraltar, Morgan was trapped by the Spanish Armada de Barlovento led by Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa. Despite being outgunned Morgan's fleet defeated and wiped out the Spanish fleet in a pitched naval battle on the bar of Maracaibo. Following this Morgan was to able escape getting past the fortress guarding the lake after successful ruse. His fleet got back to Jamaica unscathed with a significant amount of plunder.\nBackground\nFurther information: Anglo-Spanish War (1654\u20131660)\nEngland and Spain had remained in a state of war in the Caribbean following the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. England's taking possession of Jamaica since 1657 had yet to be confirmed by Spain in a treaty. As a result, Buccaneers were invited, to base themselves at Port Royal, to help defend against Spanish attacks.\nHenry Morgan, who had been in charge of the Port Royal militia and the defence of Jamaica, took over further privateering expeditions as Admiral in Chief of the Confederacy of Buccaneers. Thomas Modyford the Governor of Jamaica gave Morgan a letter of marque. who then conducted a raid on Puerto Principe which yielded a satisfactory profit. Another larger raid took place on Porto Bello which was even more successful.\nHenry Morgan\nSoon after the 26 gun HMS Oxford was given to Morgan as a gift from King Charles II of England. In October 1668 Morgan sailed with ten ships and 800 men for \u00cele-\u00e0-Vache, a small island he used as a rendezvous point. His plan was to attack the Spanish port of Cartagena de Indias, the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main. On 2 January 1669 Morgan called a council of war for all his captains, which took place on Oxford. Anchored off the \u00cele \u00e0 Vache, a party took place onboard - somehow during the drunken excitement the powder magazine was ignited by a lose spark and subsequently the ship was blown up. Over 200 were killed with the only survivors being six men and four boys of the crew. Morgan was lucky as he and the six other captains that sat on the same side survived, while those opposite him were killed.\nRecovering from the disaster, Morgan needed another ship. The French 36 gun warshsip Le Cerf Volant had been captured a month before by Edward Collier in the Oxford. The French had been accused of committing acts of piracy against English merchants. Collier's crew searched their ship and found a Letter of Marque given by the Governor of Baracoa, the evidence they needed to cement their claims. The Letter of Marque stated the French were permitted to trade in Spanish ports, however they were also allowed to engage English pirates. Le Cerf Volant was renamed the Satisfaction and the French tried as Pirates in Jamaica but they were reprieved.\nThe loss of Oxford meant Morgan's flotilla was too small to attempt an attack on Cartagena. By the time they had reached Saona, at the eastern end of Santo Domingo, three more of his ships deserted which included vast majority of the French, bitter about the treatment of their fellow countrymen, leaving only eight ships with 500 men as a whole. With their much-reduced numbers Morgan decided to loot Trinidad, but the fleet broke up en route when other captains chose their own targets. Instead he was persuaded by a French captain Pierre Le Picard under his command to repeat the actions of the Tortuga corsair Jean-David Nau, or better known as Fran\u00e7ois l'Olonnais. Two years previously he led an attacks on Maracaibo and Gibraltar, both on Lake Maracaibo. The lake was eighty six miles long, and up to sixty miles wide. Morgan planned to sail right to the very far end and raid Gibraltar.\nSince l'Olonnais and Picard had visited Maracaibo, the Spanish had built the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, 20 miles (32\u00a0km) outside the city, on the approach. The brand new fortress was placed in a strategic position to defend the town, nevertheless it was undermanned, leaving only nine men to load and fire the fortress's eleven guns.\nBefore heading to Maracaibo, Morgan's fleet came to anchor at the Dutch island of Aruba and stocked up on food and supplies. Other notable privateers who sailed with Morgan were  and at least five\nother captains, veterans of the Portobello attack, Jeffrey Pennant, Richard Norman, Richard Dobson, Edward Dempster, Adam Brewster and John Morris.\nRaid\nMorgan arrived off Lake Maracaibo on 9 March - Picard knew the approaches to the lagoon, and was able to guide the fleet through a narrow and shallow channel. Within the day they came across the San Carlo",

    "Since the late 19th century, relations between Morocco and Italy have been marked by friendship and mutual cooperation. The first diplomatic mission was sent during the reign of Sultan Moulay Hassan I to King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy in 1879.\nEconomic relations\nMorocco considers Italy a key trading partner, although the economic relationship between the two countries has not yet reached a level commensurate with their standings. According to the Italian Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), the volume of trade between Morocco and Italy reached \u20ac1.993 billion between January and November 2013, compared to \u20ac1.797 billion during the same period in 2012, representing a growth rate of 10.9%. This figure is modest when compared to Spain's exports to Morocco, which amounted to \u20ac5.508 billion. Spain has become Morocco's top supplier with a market share of 13.1%, while Italy fell to the eighth position with a share of 4.6%. Key Moroccan imports from Italy include refined petroleum products, industrial, agricultural, and medical machinery and equipment, as well as electrical devices, cars, and chemical and plastic products.\nDriving license agreement\nIn March 2024, the governments of Morocco and Italy signed an agreement in Rome for the mutual recognition of driving licenses for the purpose of exchanging them. The agreement was signed by Mr. Youssef Balla, Morocco's ambassador to Italy, and Mr. Matteo Salvini, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, in the presence of the Deputy Minister in charge of maritime transport. This agreement aims to remove obstacles faced by Moroccans residing in Italy when exchanging new generation driving licenses with Italian registration services.\nTrade exchanges\nMorocco exports various fishery and agricultural products and leather goods. As for the nature and volume of Italian investments in Morocco, their value reached \u20ac500 million. Italy has had a significant role in major projects, including the construction of dams, highways, and other infrastructure, industrial, and service sector projects. There are also branches of major Italian companies in Morocco. Due to the economic crisis, around 100 small and medium-sized Italian companies have entered the Moroccan market in the past three years, seeking new markets and opportunities to showcase their expertise.\nSecurity cooperation\nTo strengthen security cooperation amidst increasing regional and international security challenges, Morocco and Italy aim to exchange information and expertise, coordinate efforts to combat organized crime and terrorism, and ensure security and stability in both countries. On June 3, 2024, Abdelatif Hammouchi, Director General of National Security and Territorial Surveillance, received Vittorio Pisani, Director General of the Italian National Police, in Rabat. This visit was part of an official trip to Morocco by a significant Italian security delegation.\nMoroccans in Italy\nAccording to a 2013 census, Moroccans constitute the second-largest foreign community in Italy, with over 517,000 residents, including 300,000 workers and 106,000 students in Italian schools and secondary institutions.\nStatistics from the Bank of Italy revealed that remittances by Moroccan migrants to Morocco saw a significant increase of around 15% in recent years. In 2017, these remittances amounted to \u20ac277.157 million, confirming an upward trend that has gradually returned to levels seen approximately a decade ago. After exceeding \u20ac333 million, remittances fell to \u20ac240 million in 2013.\n",

    "Genus of lichens\nEndocena is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Icmadophilaceae. It has two species. Endocena is characterised by a thallus that can range from crustose to somewhat fruticose, with features such as hollow pustules, pseudopodetia, and granular phyllocladia. Apothecia, or sexual fruiting bodies, are rare and poorly developed. The three taxa within the genus have distinct distributional ranges, with Endocena informis var. informis being widely distributed in southern South America, while Endocena informis var. falklandica is common in the Falkland Islands, and Endocena buckii has a restricted range in Chilean Tierra del Fuego.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus Endocena was established by the Scottish lichenologist James Mascall Morrison Crombie in 1876, based on a specimen collected on the west coast of Chile. The type species, Endocena informis, was distinguished from Siphula by its hollow thallus structure. Crombie included this single species in the genus and highlighted its similarities to Siphula while noting the key difference of a hollow thallus. This relationship and the genus's placement within the family Icmadophilaceae were later confirmed by Stenroos and colleagues in 2002.\nIn examining the extensive lichen collections from southern South America, several collections from the Falkland Islands and Isla de los Estados were found to resemble E.\u00a0informis but differed in being sorediate and having a thallus composed of flat to convex areoles. These collections were chemically similar to E.\u00a0informis, both containing thamnolic acid. Further molecular studies aimed to confirm the placement of this new sorediate taxon within Endocena, revealing that both it and E.\u00a0informis were congeneric with the recently proposed genus Chirleja. This new taxon was morphologically distinct but genetically similar, leading to the proposal to synonymise Chirleja under Endocena.\nMolecular data, including ITS and mitochondrial small subunit sequences, showed that members of Endocena and Chirleja form a supported monophyletic group within the Icmadophilaceae. Despite the genetic uniformity, significant morphological differences were observed among the taxa, leading to the recognition of distinct species and varieties within the genus. As a result, the genus Chirleja was synonymised under Endocena, with Endocena buckii (formerly Chirleja buckii) and Endocena informis var. falklandica (a sorediate taxon from the Falkland Islands) being formally recognised.\nDescription\nThe genus Endocena features a thallus that can range from crustose (crust-like) to subfruticose (somewhat shrub-like), composed of hollow pustules or pseudopodetia (stalk-like structures), or solid pseudopodetia with granular phyllocladia (leaf-like structures) on a thin primary thallus in one species. The thallus may or may not have soredia (powdery reproductive structures). Sporodochia (asexual spore-producing structures) are present in one species.\nApothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) are very rare, poorly developed, sessile (attached directly without a stalk), up to 2\u00a0mm in diameter, with irregular, strongly concave discs and flexuose (wavy) margins. The disc is pale pink-buff and no functional hymenium (spore-producing tissue) has been observed.\nChemically, Endocena contains thamnolic acid, as identified by thin-layer chromatography. Apothecia have been reported  from four collections, two from E.\u00a0informis var. falklandica and two from E.\u00a0informis var. informis. The apothecia start as thalline warts with a white, granular surface that expands and becomes pinkish as the white granules disperse, eventually revealing the apothecium disc.\nHabitat and distribution\nEndocena includes three taxa with distinct distributional ranges. Endocena informis var. informis is widely distributed throughout southern South America, from the Falkland Islands and Isla de los Estados to the southern regions of Chile, extending as far north as Regi\u00f3n de los Lagos (42\u00b0S). It is rarely reported from Argentina, with only a few historical records. Despite this, it is frequently collected on Isla de los Estados and southern Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego.\nEndocena informis var. falklandica is common in the Falkland Islands but less frequent in Tierra del Fuego, known from only two collections in Chile. Endocena buckii has an even more restricted range, with a single known collection from Seno Agostini in Chilean Tierra del Fuego.\nThere is a dubious report of E.\u00a0informis from Macquarie Island, Australia, which lacks supporting herbarium specimens and is likely a misidentification of a similar species. The ecological preferences of these taxa vary, with both varieties of E.\u00a0informis being terricolous and primarily found in open heathland. Variety informis typically grows among bryophytes, while var. falklandica is more frequent on soil and peat. The single collection of E.\u00a0buckii was from the underside of a tree in a wet Nothofagus forest, though it may also inhabit soil-based envi",

    "1933 murder of the President of Peru\nOn April 30, 1933, Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro, then president of Peru, was assassinated while riding in his presidential convertible at the Santa Beatriz racetrack in Santa Beatriz, a neighbourhood of Lima, Peru. S\u00e1nchez Cerro was accompanied by Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Manzanilla\u00a0, Chief of Military Staff Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Ram\u00edrez and his aide-de-camp, Major Eleazar Atencio, when he was fatally shot by APRA militant Abelardo Mendoza Leyva. S\u00e1nchez Cerro was rushed to the Italian Hospital where he was pronounced dead two hours later. Also killed in the attack was Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Pisco, a member of the Republican Guard who had attempted to protect the president.\nS\u00e1nchez Cerro was immediately replaced by \u00d3scar R. Benavides as president after he was elected by Congress. As head of the Revolutionary Union, his political party, he was replaced by Luis A. Flores. The assassination led to a diplomatic end of the ongoing armed conflict with Colombia, as Benavides met with President Alfonso L\u00f3pez Pumarejo two weeks later, agreeing to cease hostilities and handing over the disputed area to a League of Nations delegation, ultimately signing the Rio Protocol in 1934.\nBackground\nAfter the anarchy unleashed in Peru after the fall of Augusto B. Legu\u00eda's second presidency in 1930, the situation stabilised in 1931 with the installation of the National Junta\u00a0 of David Samanez Ocampo, which called for general elections, in which Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro, the soldier who had been the architect of Legu\u00eda's downfall, won.\nIt was expected that life in the country would normalise with the return to democracy, but S\u00e1nchez Cerro's rival in the elections, V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre, leader of the newly founded American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA)\u2014then with an anti-oligarchic and anti-imperialist tendency\u2014did not recognise his victory and went to the most outrageous opposition. A civil war ensed, whose most violent point was the Trujillo revolution of 1932.\nS\u00e1nchez Cerro had already been shot at on March 6, 1932, while attending mass in Miraflores. The perpetrator was Jos\u00e9 Melgar, an APRA member.\nAssassination\nS\u00e1nchez Cerro at the racetrack.\nOn the morning of April 30, 1933, S\u00e1nchez Cerro reviewed the recruits who were going to fight in the ongoing armed conflict with Colombia and who were gathered at the Santa Beatriz Hippodrome, today the Campo de Marte. Once the ceremony was over, he left in his vehicle, an open-topped Hispano-Suiza car, amidst the applause of the crowd.\nAccompanying the president inside the car were Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Manzanilla\u00a0, Chief of Military Staff Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Ram\u00edrez and his aide-de-camp, Major Eleazar Atencio. S\u00e1nchez Cerro sat in the back seat of the car, on the right side, while Manzanilla was to his left. Rodr\u00edguez and Atencio were in the front seats, in addition to the pilot. Next to it was a horse escort and followed by another car, where the members of the Military Staff were riding. The vehicle moved slowly, in the middle of the crowd, at the request of the president himself, who wanted to avoid any accidents.\nIt was in that circumstance when Mendoza breached the human chain holding back the crowd, rushed towards the presidential car, and holding onto the hood, fired several shots towards the president's back. The driver accelerated the car, throwing Mendoza to the ground, who was instantly shot by the presidential escort and by the members of the military staff who were in the other car. Some soldiers from the escort even pierced him with their spears. The autopsy protocol would later determine that Mendoza's body received twenty gunshot wounds caused by thirteen projectiles, and four spear wounds that destroyed a lung, liver and intestines.\nS\u00e1nchez Cerro leaves the scene.\nThe weapon used by Mendoza, a Browning pistol, was picked up by an individual named \u00c1ngel Mill\u00e1n Ramos, an employee of Huancayo's post office, who took it with him. But a witness reported him, and he was captured and implicated in the crime.\nIn the confusing shootout, one of the members of the security staff, gendarme Rodr\u00edguez Pisco, who had chased Mendoza, was also killed, and a second lieutenant, two corporals and two soldiers were wounded. It is believed that there were civilians who fired from afar, hiding in some trees and palm trees, which has given rise to the theory of a plot.\nAs for S\u00e1nchez Cerro, he was rushed to the Italian Hospital (located at the intersection of Grau and Abancay avenues) where he was treated by doctors Juan Luis Raffo, Abel Delgado and Te\u00f3filo Rocha. Serum and tonic injections were applied, but after two hours of agony, he died at 1:10\u00a0p.m. According to the doctors' report, one of the two shots he received hit him in the precordial area, lodging in his heart and causing internal bleeding, which caused his death.\nAftermath\nThe entrance to the Italian Hospital where S\u00e1nchez Cerro died.\nThe murderer was identified as Abelardo Mendoza Leyva.",

    "\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Chimie Belgique or the Belgian Royal Society of Chemistry, Walloon Royal Society of Chemistry, is a learned society and professional association headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. The society published the academic journal Bulletin des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Chimiques Belges from 1904 to 1987, before it was absorbed into the Europe-wide chemistry journals. Since 1983, the society also publishes the journal Chimie Nouvelle (English: New Chemistry).\nHistory\nThe society was founded in 1887 by Edouard Hanuise as the Association Belge des Chimistes (English: Belgian Association of Chemists). In 1904, it changed its name to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Chimique de Belgique (English: Belgian Chemical Society) until its final name change so far in 1987 at its one-hundredth anniversary to its present name. In 1939, the society split into a French-speaking and a Dutch-speaking branch. The French-speaking branch kept the existing name (later the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Chimie Belgique) and was still based in Brussels. The Dutch-speaking branch was founded with the name Vlaamse Chemische Vereniging and later in 1987 became Koninklijke Vlaamse Chemische Vereniging (English: Royal Flemish Chemical Society), which was based in Antwerp.\nIts past members includes famous chemists within the country such as Ernest Solvay, Walth\u00e8re Victor Spring, Theodore Swarts, Jean Timmermans, etc.\nPresidents of the society\nPresidents of the society throughout history include early pioneers of chemistry and pharmacy in Belgium.\nAssociation Belge des Chimistes (1887\u20131904)\n1887\u20131895 Edouard Hanuise\n1894\u20131896 Jean-Baptiste Depaire\n1897\u20131898 Achille Herlant\n1899\u20131900 Lucien Louis De Koninck\n1901\u20131902 L\u00e9on Crismer\n1903\u20131904 Albert van de Velde\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Chimique de Belgique (1904\u20131987)\n1910\u20131911 Ren\u00e9 Lucion\n1914\u20131921 Georges Chavanne\n1925\u20131926 Henri Wuyts\n1927\u20131928 Jean Timmermans\n1929\u20131930 Pierre Bruylants\n1958 Lucia de Brouck\u00e8re\n1961\u20131962 Albert Bruylants\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Chimie Belgique (1987\u2013now)\n2014 Claudine Buess-Herman\n2020\u20132021 Laurent Provins\n2023 Anne-Sophie Duwez\nSee also\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 chimique de France\nGerman Chemical Society\nList of chemistry societies\n",
    "Earthquake in Latin America\nThe 1822 Costa Rica earthquake had an estimated surface-wave magnitude of 7.5\u20137.6 and struck the nation's Caribbean coast. The earthquake largely affected the country's east coast and generated a tsunami. Thrust faulting was inferred as a plausible mechanism for the earthquake and its damage pattern was similar to a 1991 shock of similar magnitude. Damage was also recorded in neighbouring countries.\nTectonic setting\nAt the west coast of Costa Rica, the east-moving Cocos Plate subducts beneath the Caribbean Plate which the country is situated on. Ongoing subduction occurs at the Middle America Trench where the subduction rate varies between 70\u00a0mm (2.8\u00a0in) and 95\u00a0mm (3.7\u00a0in) annually from Guatamela to Costa Rica. The Panama block, a microplate, lies southeast of the country; its boundary with the Caribbean Plate, the Panama Thrust Bent, is a destructive plate boundary that stretches from Colombia to Limon, near the east coast of Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, the Panama Thrust Bent causes the Caribbean Plate to underthrust beneath the Cordillera de Talamanca. A study of aftershocks following the 1991 shock suggests a near horizontal d\u00e9collement at 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) depth with steeper splays branching from the base to the surface. The northwesternmost boundary of the Panama Block is a northwest\u2013southeast striking left-lateral fault system.\nEarthquake\nThe presence of tsunami observations along the Caribbean coast suggests possible reverse-faulting associated with the shock. A surface-wave magnitude of 7.5\u20137.6 and possibly larger was inferred from isoseismal information for the felt area of Modified Mercalli intensity VI (Strong). The isoseismal information also indicated a probable epicenter near the Caribbean coast. The Modified Mercalli intensity at the epicenter area was estimated at IX (Violent). Damage was severe in the central and western part of the country, and in eastern Panama. Coastal uplift was also reported in Panama. Damage patterns and observed uplift were similar to another earthquake in 1991; the 1822 earthquake has been suggested to have ruptured the same area of the back-arc region.\nEffects\nThree distinct \"shocks\" were reported in Matina; deep fissures appeared in the ground and ejected black sand and water. Severe inundation also occurred along rivers. Destruction in Cartago was reported as near total. Houses and walls in the city were damaged; the San Miguel Hospital was severely affected and officials had to demolish barracks, parishes and the Church and convent of San Francisco. Damage was also reported in Panama and Nicaragua. Among the affected infrastructure of San Jos\u00e9 was the city's tobacco factory. A Scottish merchant in the area documented swaying trees and frightened wildlife during the earthquake.\nAn unknown number of people died and were injured in the country's central valley region. The earthquake struck Costa Rica during a period of unrest in the country which recently gained independence the year prior. Residents and those in power interpreted the earthquake as a sign for society sought order and resolution. In Cartago, residents helped in restoring the city. Reconstruction and post-disaster assistance continued until 1829.\nReports of a tsunami in Bocas del Toro between 1820 and 1830 may correspond to the tsunami of 7 May 1822. A historic document also described \"rivers and bay grew and caused floods\"; flooding and \"bay grew\" may be interpreted as the tsunami causing a flood. The reports of liquefaction and tsunami were also compared with the 1991 earthquake.\nSee also\nList of earthquakes in Costa Rica\n",

    "Municipal building in Newton Abbot, Devon, England\nThe Old Town Hall, also known as No. 9 Devon Square, is a former municipal building in Devon Square in Newton Abbot, a town in Devon, in England. The structure, which started life as a private house and was later converted for municipal use, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe building was commissioned by the local landowner, William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon, as part of a terrace of five properties on Devon Square. The site he chose was occupied by a  lock-up which was used to accommodate escaped prisoners from HM Prison Dartmoor and was supervised by the Superintendent Constable of the Lock-up House, William Thomas Baker.\nThe terrace was designed by the earl\u2019s architect, William John Rowell, in the Italianate style, built in brick with a stucco finish and was completed in 1862. On completion of the building, Rowell moved into No. 9 himself, accompanied by his wife and children. Rowell continued to live there until he died in September 1911. The building was then taken over by the YMCA which remained there until after the Second World War.\nIn the 1980s, the building was acquired by Newton Abbot Town Council as their offices and meeting place and an extension was added at its rear. The Newton Abbot Town and Great Western Railway Museum was established in the building in the early 1990s. At a ceremony in the building, the commanding officer of the nuclear submarine, HMS Triumph, Commander Steve Waller, accepted the freedom of the town in September 2019.\nIn March 2020, the town council relocated to St Leonard's Church in Wolborough Street, which was restored and converted to accommodate the council. The museum followed to St Leonard's Church in October 2020. The building in Devon Square, which was renamed Great Western House, was subsequently occupied by a firm of funeral directors, Parker's Family Funeral Directors.\nArchitecture\nThe two-storey building, No. 9 Devon Square, is at one end of the terrace, and was originally a mirror image of No. 13 Devon Square, at the other end of the terrace.  Like No. 13, it is projected forward from the centre of the terrace, and its front is three bays wide and features an oculus in the centre of the gable. The ground floor is fenestrated by rusticated sash windows which are pedimented, except for the central bay with is surmounted by a cornice. The first floor is fenestrated round headed windows; the window in the central bay is surmounted by a curved pediment. Access to No. 9 is up a short flight of steps and through a doorway on the St Paul's Road frontage to the building. The entire terrace was grade II listed in 1975.\nNotes\n^ The Newton Abbot Local Board and, from 1894, the Newton Abbot Urban District Council were based at council offices in Courtenay Street, but those offices ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Teignbridge District Council was formed in offices Kingsteignton Road in 1974.\n",

    "Canadian YouTube channel\nSuper Best Friends Play, initially known as Two Best Friends Play, was a Canadian YouTube channel and ensemble known for their Let's Play videos. The channel was originally created by Matthew Kowalewski and Patrick Boivin as a series on the now-defunct gaming network Machinima, based around the idea of two friends arguing while playing video games. Hosted on the separate account TheSw1tcher, the group's content focused on both popular and obscure games, and the series later included members Woolie Madden and Liam Allen-Miller.\nOn December 16, 2018, the group uploaded their final video announcing their breakup. Their dissolution was attributed to Kowalewski and Boivin no longer being friends, and each member continued making content individually. Following the disbandment, the series sustained a dedicated cult following with an active fanbase on social media sites. Super Best Friends Play was among the most popular Let's Play channels on YouTube, and was noted for popularizing various obscure games.\nOrigins and content\nSuper Best Friends Play was started in 2011 by Montreal, Quebec natives Matthew \"Matt\" Kowalewski and Patrick \"Pat\" Bolvin. Kowalewski had worked as a quality assurance tester for various game studios such as Eidos-Montr\u00e9al, while Boivin was a grocery store bagger following his graduation from university as a psychology major. The duo had met as mutual friends of future member Woolie Madden, and following an upload of a Street Fighter cartoon compilation, Kowalewski recruited Boivin to collaborate with him on a comedic video of Kirby's Epic Yarn. According to Kowalewski, the idea for the Kirby's Epic Yarn video was to have two people arguing and getting angry over the game, which was noted for its easy difficulty. First naming themselves \"Two Best Friends Play\" ironically in reference to their dynamic, the duo proceeded to make more Let's Play-based videos on YouTube which soon received attention. After several months, a representative from the gaming network Machinima contacted Kowalewski to offer them a partnership to produce videos for their network. Initially working as contributors to the network, they soon garnered popularity and revenue from their videos, which allowed them to leave their jobs to become full-time YouTubers. Becoming Super Best Friends Play, the channel eventually included Madden and Liam Allen-Miller, the latter of whom would leave in 2016 to focus on his streaming career.\nSuper Best Friends Play primarily uploaded long-form Let's Play videos on their main channel \"TheSw1tcher\". The duo's dynamic revolved around Kowalewski playing the innocent straight man to Boivin's angrier nerdy persona. Madden was known for his friendly nature and his enjoyment of competitive fighting games, while Allen-Miller was considered the quiet one in the group. Contrasting from other gaming channels, Super Best Friends Play created Let's Play videos on a wide variety of games, including both titles from the popular Resident Evil and Silent Hill series, and more obscure Japanese-based games such as the then niche series Persona and Yakuza. Their content was noted for emphasizing the members' individual gaming tastes rather than focusing on trending game releases. The group played both console and PC games, and often played various horror-themed games throughout October in anticipation for Halloween. Other games the group played included Kingdom Hearts, Metal Wolf Chaos and the unofficially released fighting game Death Cargo. Their content also contained several memes and running gags, such as mocking Quantic Dream games. Their fanbase was referred to as the \"Best Friends Zaibatsu,\" which jokingly referenced Japanese conglomerates.\nBreakup and responses\nOn Sunday, December 16, 2018, a video titled \"Super Best Friends (FINAL)\" was uploaded to their channel. In the video, Madden, Kowalewski and Boivin appeared in separate segments to explain their decision to disband the group. Madden stated that \"Matt and Pat are no longer friends\", and attributed business aspects to the deterioration of Kowalewski and Boivin's friendship. Each member specified that they would focus on their individual content following their disbandment. Madden would continue making traditional Let's Play videos on his channel \"Woolie Versus,\" alongside creating video essays and a podcast called \"Woolie Will Figure it Out.\" Kowalewski would also create video game and film reviews on his channel \"Matt McMuscles\", along with working on the beat 'em up fighting game The TakeOver. Boivin would focus on live streaming games on Twitch. Their channel would remain inactive as an archive for their past videos. The final Let's Play series they had uploaded was Kingdom Hearts.\nConsidered an unexpected announcement, their dissolution led to numerous reactions across social media. Fans expressed feelings of shock on the official Super Best Friends subreddit, which then had over 50,000 members. On Twitter, \"SuperBes",

    "FOrmer French bank\nFormer head office on Place des Petits-P\u00e8res\u00a0 in Paris\nThe Banque Louis-Dreyfus was a bank based in Paris, France. It was created in 1905 by commodities trader and financier L\u00e9opold Louis-Dreyfus, and eventually purchased in two stages in 1978 and 1989 by Bank Brussels Lambert (BBL), later part of ING.\nOverview\nL\u00e9opold Louis-Dreyfus founded the bank to facilitate financing of the activities of his family-held Louis Dreyfus Company, founded in 1850 and based in Paris since 1875, and particularly its creation of a fleet of commercial ships, an activity he had started in 1900. Also in 1905, Louis-Dreyfus commissioned a new headquarters for the bank from prominent architect Henri Paul N\u00e9not. \nFollowing the Battle of France, the firm's assets in France were sequestered by the Vichy regime. From 1941 to 1944, the bank's building became the seat of the regime's Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs.\nThe bank's activities restarted after France's liberation and were registered as an investment bank under French law in 1954. In 1967, the bank transformed itself from a partnership (French: soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en nom collectif) into a joint-stock company (French: soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme). At the time, it was France's tenth-largest investment bank by assets, ahead of the Banque Rothschild.\nin 1974, the Louis-Dreyfus group, including the bank, relocated form central Paris to a modern building at 87, avenue de la Grande-Arm\u00e9e on Porte Maillot, designed by architect Pierre Dufau and nicknamed the \"blue diamond\" (French: le diamant bleu) for its then-unusual blue-tinted curtain walls.\nIn 1978, BBL acquired slightly over 50 percent of Banque Louis-Dreyfus, then full ownership in 1989. The Louis-Dreyfus Company created another bank, branded LD Finance, in 1994, but sold a controlling stake in it in 1998.\nThe bank's first head office on Place des Petits-P\u00e8res was later acquired by the French Ministry of Culture. The \"blue diamond\" in turn was renovated with green-tinted glass cladding instead of Dufau's original blue.\nSee also\nBanque Lambert\nNotes\n^ a b \"La banque Louis-Dreyfus se transforme en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme\".

    "Mexican politician (born 1969)\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Lemus and the second or maternal family name is  Navarro.\nJes\u00fas Pablo Lemus Navarro (born 18 July 1969) is a Mexican politician, businessman and communicator. He was president of the Employers' Confederation of the Mexican Republic (COPARMEX) of Jalisco, general director of Credicampo and, from 2015 to 2021, mayor of Zapopan in Jalisco. From 2021 to 2023, he was municipal president of Guadalajara. He is the governor-elect of Jalisco for the Citizens' Movement (MC) in the 2024 elections.\nEarly life and education\nLemus was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, on 18 July 1969, in a family dedicated to the musical instrument trade. He is married to Maye Villa, with whom he has four children.\nLemus completed a degree in Business Administration at the ITESO, Universidad Jesuita de Guadalajara. Upon completion, he continued with two postgraduate degrees, one in Finance at the Panamerican University and another in the specialty of Senior Business Management, at the Instituto Panamericano de Alta Direcci\u00f3n de Empresa.\nProfessional career\nAs a businessman, Lemus began his career at the head of Musical Lemus, a company belonging to his family. He then joined the Board of Directors of Multivalores Grupo Financiero (currently Grupo Multiva) and, later, he would become a partner of Credicampo. He participated in COPARMEX as president of the Young Entrepreneurs Commission, and later became the director of said organization. During his administration, from 2008 to 2011, Lemus undertook reforms to combat corruption in various levels of government, in addition to promoting citizen participation with initiatives such as Reasoned Vote and Meet Your Deputy. On the other hand, he collaborated in various media outlets in the Guadalajara metropolitan area, first as a moderator in a local television program and then as the headline of a radio news program on the Zona 3 Noticias station. He was also a columnist in a newspaper.\nPolitical career\nMayor of Zapopan\nNominated by the MC, Lemus was elected Mayor of Zapopan by popular vote for the period 2015\u20132018, with a difference of 10 percentage points. He was sworn in as Municipal President on 1 October 2015. Almost two years later, on 27 August, he was ratified in office with an approval rating of 89 percent. From the beginning of his administration, he announced that he would focus on addressing the main social problems, caused by the inequality that prevails in the municipality.\nWith the aim of developing policies for the protection, security, development and well-being of minors, the Lemus administration embarked on an action plan, since 2016, to be the City of Children. Some actions carried out in favor of Zapopan society, especially for boys and girls, were the recovery of sports and recreational spaces, creation of social programs to prevent school dropouts, stimulating employment and promoting entrepreneurship, the construction of centers community with art workshops and the installation of the Rights Protection System for children and adolescents (SIPINNA).\nMayor of Guadalajara\nIn February 2021, Lemus requested a license as mayor of Zapopan to aspire to a multi-member council by the Citizens' Movement. During this process, he also confirmed that he would be in charge of coordinating the campaigns for the local councils of Jalisco.\nOn March 16, Ismael del Toro Castro, candidate for the presidency of Guadalajara, resigned from the electoral race for family reasons. Two days later, the leader of the Jalisco Citizens' Movement, Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez, presented Lemus as the new candidate for mayor. Lemus would be elected mayor and was sworn in on 1 October 2021. He resigned from the position on 27 October 2023 in order to run for governor of Jalisco.\nGovernor of Jalisco\nOn 2 June 2024, as part of the local elections, Lemus was elected governor of Jalisco.\n",

At its last session on 3 December 1989, the Central Committee elected Semmelmann to a commission tasked with analyzing the causes of the crisis in the SED and in society.\n",
    "Former lifeboat station in County Louth, Ireland\nBaltray Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, located at The Haven, in the village of Baltray, on the north side of the River Boyne, near Drogheda in County Louth, Ireland.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here, Drogheda (No.1), by the RNLI in 1856.\nWith only eight calls in 20 years, Baltray Lifeboat Station was closed in 1899.\nHistory\nBefore there was a Drogheda lifeboat, Robert Kirkpatrick Thompson, Chief Officer of H.M. Coastguard at Clogherhead, received the RNLI Gold Medal in 1839, for the rescue of the Master and three crew from the schooner Minerva, wrecked on the North Bar at Drogheda on 31 March 1839.\nThe first Drogheda lifeboat was a 30-foot Self-righting 'pulling and sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with both oars and sail, of 'Mr. Peake's design', built by Forrestt of Limehouse, London, at a cost of \u00a3155. A carriage was supplied from Ransomes & Sons of Ipswich, and a boathouse was constructed at Baltray, near the mouth of the River Boyne, by the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners. Both lifeboat and carriage were transport to Drogheda free of charge by the British and Irish Steam Packet Company. The station opened in 1856. John McNamara was appointed Honorary Secretary.\nOn 7 February 1862, the Baltray lifeboat was launched to the aid of the brig Minerva on Workington, aground on the South Bull. Holed and taking on water, the crew of five and the Captain were rescued.\nA 28-foot lifeboat was placed at Baltray in 1862. It was named Rescue, and had served at St Sampson in Guernsey from 1857. It would be launched to the aid of the schooner Mary Anne, driven ashore on 2 February 1863, and rescued the crew of five.\nIn 1867, funds were appropriated from the legacy of Miss Maria Irlam of Dibbinsdale, Bromborough, and the lifeboat was renamed Old George Irlam of Liverpool. Two later lifeboats also carried the name Old George Irlam of Liverpool.\nOn passage from Newport, Monmouthshire to Dublin, the brig Manly\nwas driven onto the sands in a severe gale on 27 September 1871. Baltray lifeboat launched, but could not reach the vessel in the conditions. Six of the crew of the Manly were lost. One person survived. He had been washed away from the vessel, but had a lifebouy, and was rescued from the heavy surf by Miss Jane Campbell, assisted by a Mrs Fox. Jane Campbell was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal, with Mrs Fox receiving 'The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum'.\nFollowing the loss of the Manly, it was decided to open a No.2 station at Drogheda in 1872, located on the south side of the River Boyne at Mornington, County Meath.\nOn 25 September 1876, Old George Irlam of Liverpool was launched to the aid of the brigantine Maxim, on passage from Liverpool to Saint John's, Newfoundland. Driven ashore 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) north of the River Boyne bar, the eight crewmen were rescued.\nBetween 1879 and 1899, the Baltray lifeboat was launched only eight times, with no lives saved. In 1899, it was decided to close one of the stations on the River Boyne, and place a lifeboat further up the coast at Clogherhead, a fishing port, with no shortage of crew. Mornington lifeboat station remained in service (until 1926), and the Baltray Lifeboat Station was closed.\nThe lifeboat on station at the time, Charles Whitton (ON 334), would serve at Mornington from 1901 to 1902, and become the Port Isaac lifeboat from 1905 to 1927. The station building was handed over to Drogheda Corporation for temporary use as an Isolation hospital in 1900. All that remains today is evidence of the launchway.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Baltray\nRNLI Gold Medal\nRobert Kirkpatrick Thompson, Chief Officer of coastguard - 1839\nRNLI Silver Medal\nMiss Jane Campbell - 1871\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nMrs Fox - 1871\nBaltray lifeboats\n^ ON is the RNLI's Official Number of the boat.\nPre ON numbers are unofficial numbers used by the Lifeboat Enthusiast Society to reference early lifeboats not included on the official RNLI list.\nSee also\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\nNotes\n^ 30-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, built by Forrestt of Limehouse, costing \u00a3155.\n^ 28-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, which cost \u00a3136 when new.\n^ 32-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, costing \u00a3246\n^ 34-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, costing \u00a3363\n^ 34-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, costing \u00a3437\n",

I turned my different identities into music. This is because I wanted a few things that I could defend and that reflected me. Inside there is electronic music, there is bossanova, there are the influences that come from my Brazilian origins and also a treatment of the Italian language. I was not at all sure I wanted to sing in Italian, I always experienced it as a kind of \u201cyou have to do it because we are in Italy.\u201d Then slowly, even with the help of great authors like Antonio Di Martino, I realized that it was actually what I really wanted. And I freed myself.\"\nCritic reception\nMattia Marzi of Rockol compared the album to Francesca Michielin's album di20 and, praising the \"minimal electronics, South American music echoes and acoustic guitars that squeeze between synths and keyboards\", calling it \"an interesting proposition and not at all trivia\".\nTracklist\nCommercial performance\nThe album debouted at number five on the Italian Albums Chart.

On Independence Day on 1 October 2010, several bombs planted in three cars detonated simultaneously near Eagle Square, venue of the Independence Day celebration presided by President GoodLuck Jonathan. A total of twelve people were confirmed dead, several others injured and properties including cars nearby were burnt. Following the bombing, Okah and his accomplices, Obi Nwabueze, Edmund Ebiware and Tiemkemfa Francis-Osvwo known as General Gbokos were arrested and arraigned on 7 December 2010 for their role in the Warri and Independence Day bombing in Abuja.\nEvidence presented by prosecutors during the trial indicated that Okah's elder brother, Henry Okah\u2014the leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND)\u2014provided a total N3.2 million naira which was used to purchase six secondhand cars used for the bombing in Warri and Abuja. Francis-Osvwo (General Gbokos) died in detention. Ebiware's\u00a0trial was conducted separately; he was found guilty as charged\u00a0and sentenced to life imprisonment on 25 January 20213. Similarly, Henry Okah\u2014who provided the funds\u2014was tried in South Africa on the same charges and on other charges of threatening South African government. He was found guilty of both charges and received a 24-year jail term on the terrorism charges and a 13-year jail term for threatening South African government in 2013.\nOn 8 March 2018, the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja found Okah and Nwabueze guilty on five of the eight counts of terrorism charges.\u00a0Both men were sentenced to life imprisonment.\nMaiduguri Maximum Security Prison\nFollowing his conviction, Okah was transferred from Kuje Prison, Abuja, where he was held throughout his trial to Maiduguri Maximum Security Prison. At the latter prison, he wrote a book detailing human rights and sexual abuses of women and children being perpetrated in the prison. The book released in January 2019 reported how an 11-year-old boy suffering from a mental condition similar to autism had been held in the prison since he was eight in a cell holding a criminal who sodomised him. The book detailed how prison officials used inmates for cheap labour. The officials carried out forced abortions on female inmates they had allegedly impregnated. An Amnesty International investigation into human and sexual abuses in the prison was found to be consistent with Okah's report.\n",

    "\nCanada Country was a chart that was published weekly by Radio & Records magazine. It was first published on April 16, 2004, when Radio & Records introduced five airplay charts for the Canadian market, country being one of them. It was the first record chart Canadians had for country music since RPM ceased publication in November 2000. This 30-position chart listed the most popular country music songs, calculated weekly by airplay from 21 Canadian stations as monitored by Mediabase Research. It finished for the year on December 17. Like most music charts, the Canada Country Top 30 had a rule when songs entered recurrent rotation. A song entered recurrent if it had been on the chart for 20 weeks or more and is ranked below number 15. This was the country music chart Canada had before Billboard magazine started their version of Canada Country in July 2006.\nSeven artists topped the chart this year. Technically, the first number one hit of the year was \"When the Sun Goes Down\" by Kenny Chesney and Uncle Kracker, but this is due to the chart only beginning publishing on April 16. Chesney would score another number one hit with \"I Go Back\". The only other artist to score multiple number one hits this year was Tim McGraw, with \"Live Like You Were Dying\" and \"Back When\". Keith Urban, Lonestar, and Gretchen Wilson also each scored a multiple-week number one single. LeAnn Rimes would achieve the final number one hit of the year with \"Nothin' 'bout Love Makes Sense\", which was her first number one single in Canada since \"Blue\" spent a single week at number one back in 1996. Despite not topping the weekly chart, Canadian artist Terri Clark had the number-one year-end song with \"Girls Lie Too\".\nThese are the Canadian number-one country songs of 2004, per the R&R Canada Country Top 30.

    "The civil flag of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the provincial flag of the Belgian province of Luxembourg became a national symbol of the Luxembourg nation in the course of the First World War.\nThe Luxembourg question refers to the political tensions surrounding the (Grand) Duchy of Luxembourg, particularly in the 19th century, but also earlier in the late Middle Ages and the early modern period, when the present-day territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was ruled by different dynasties. The issue at stake in the Luxembourg question was the territorial affiliation and independence of Luxembourg, which was located between the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Germany.\nOverall, the years 1815, 1830/1839, 1867, 1870/71 and the years between 1912 and 1919 can be regarded as the high points of the Luxembourg question. However, the Duchy of Luxembourg, which was independent until the late Middle Ages, was under the rule of the Luxembourg dynasty until it died out and a phase of constant changes of rule began, so that the Luxembourg question had a certain prehistory.\nLate Middle Ages to the early modern period\nThe Holy Roman Empire around 1400, with the Duchy of Luxembourg on the left.\nUntil its annexation by Napoleonic France, Luxembourg was a duchy within the Holy Roman Empire and was ruled by the House of Luxembourg itself until the 1440s. The House of Luxembourg provided a number of Roman-German Emperors, some of whom also became emperors. The last male head of the family was Emperor Sigismund, King of Hungary and Bohemia. With his death, the House of Luxembourg died out in the male line. Elisabeth of G\u00f6rlitz, the last member of the German line of the House of Luxembourg, sold the Duchy of Luxembourg to the House of Burgundy in 1443. This ended the rule of the Luxembourgers over the Luxembourg region and the first French period began. This was followed by several changes of rulers, but the Burgundians (1443\u20131482) and Habsburgs (1482-1700 and 1714\u20131795) were the most important dynasties on the Luxembourg throne. However, a distinction must again be made between the Spanish (1556-1684 and 1697\u20131700) and the Austrian Habsburgs (1714\u20131795) for the period after the abdication of Charles V. Between 1684 and 1697, the territory of the Duchy of Luxembourg was under French rule for a second time. In the meantime, the Wittelsbachs, Wettins and the House of Bourbon ruled over Luxembourg. The history of the duchy came to an end in 1795 when France annexed the territory and integrated it into the French state.\nThe United Kingdom of the Netherlands. In the lower right area is the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which was in personal union with the Dutch state, but was not part of it.\nCongress of Vienna 1815\nMain article: Congress of Vienna\nAfter the French Empire lost the last coalition war, Luxembourg was restored and elevated to a Grand duchy. In addition, the Grand Duchy was awarded to the Dutch king, who also received what is now Belgium (minus Eupen-Malmedy, which was gained in 1919). From then on, the Grand Duchy was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in personal union with the Dutch king. This was for reasons of power politics, as the aim was to create a new balance of power in Europe after the defeat of France. In the territory of the Low Countries, the new Kingdom of the Netherlands (the official name of the above-mentioned state) was ultimately to have supremacy, while the Kingdom of Prussia was to exist in the east and France in the south. However, Luxembourg was not part of the Dutch state, but merely ruled by the same monarch, who reigned as King and Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\nIn addition, the Dutch king thus became a German federal prince. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and the Confederation of the Rhine in 1815, contrary to the German nationalists, the German Confederation was founded at the Congress of Vienna instead of a unified German state. Luxembourg remained a member of the German Confederation until its dissolution in 1866. Luxembourg itself was also home to one of the most important federal fortresses, which had to be dismantled as a result of the Luxembourg crisis in 1867. Between 1839 and 1866, Luxembourg was also linked via the Dutch king to the Duchy of Limburg, which had also been a federal state in the German Confederation and which was created in the course of the Belgian Revolution of 1839. Together with both duchies, the Dutch king had a vote in the Federal Convention of the German Confederation.\nBelgian Revolution 1830/1839\nMain articles: Belgian Revolution and Treaty of London (1839)\nThe area around Belgium between 1830 and 1839.\nIn 1830, there was a revolution in the southern Netherlands, whose population was predominantly Roman Catholic, against the predominantly reformed northern part of the Netherlands. As a result of the revolution, the new Kingdom of Belgium left the Dutch state and received a large part of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which is n",

Unknown hackers attacked Canada's foreign ministry in 2022.\nChina\nMain article: Chinese cyberwarfare\nChina's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has developed a strategy called \"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare\" which guides computer network operations and cyber warfare tools. This strategy helps link together network warfare tools and electronic warfare weapons against an opponent's information systems during the conflict. They believe the fundamentals for achieving success is about seizing control of an opponent's information flow and establishing information dominance. The Science of Military and The Science of Campaigns both identify enemy logistics systems networks as the highest priority for cyberattacks and states that cyber warfare must mark the start of a campaign, used properly, can enable overall operational success. Focusing on attacking the opponent's infrastructure to disrupt transmissions and processes of information that dictate decision-making operations, the PLA would secure cyber dominance over their adversary. The predominant techniques that would be utilized during a conflict to gain the upper hand are as follows, the PLA would strike with electronic jammers, electronic deception, and suppression techniques to interrupt the transfer processes of information. They would launch virus attacks or hacking techniques to sabotage information processes, all in the hopes of destroying enemy information platforms and facilities. The PLA's Science of Campaigns noted that one role for cyber warfare is to create windows of opportunity for other forces to operate without detection or with a lowered risk of counterattack by exploiting the enemy's periods of \"blindness\", \"deafness\" or \"paralysis\" created by cyberattacks. That is one of the main focal points of cyber warfare, to be able to weaken your enemy to the full extent possible so that your physical offensive will have a higher percentage of success.\nThe PLA conducts regular training exercises in a variety of environments emphasizing the use of cyber warfare tactics and techniques in countering such tactics if it is employed against them.  Faculty research has been focusing on designs for rootkit usage and detection for their Kylin Operating System which helps to further train these individuals' cyber warfare techniques. China perceives cyber warfare as a deterrent to nuclear weapons, possessing the ability for greater precision, leaving fewer casualties, and allowing for long-ranged attacks.\nOn March 2, 2021, Microsoft released an emergency security update to patch four security vulnerabilities that had been used by Hafnium, a Chinese nation-state-sponsored hacking group that had compromised at least 30,000 public and private Microsoft exchange servers.\nEstonia\nMain article: 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia\nThe 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia were a series of cyberattacks that began on 27 April 2007 and targeted websites of Estonian organizations, including Estonian parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers, and broadcasters, amid the country's disagreement with Russia about the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, an elaborate Soviet-era grave marker, as well as war graves in Tallinn. The attacks triggered a number of military organizations around the world to reconsider the importance of network security to modern military doctrine. The direct result of the cyberattacks was the creation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn.\nEthiopia\nIn an extension of a bilateral dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, Ethiopian government websites have been hacked by the Egypt-based hackers in June 2020.\nIndia and Pakistan\nMain article: India\u2013Pakistan relations\nThere were two such instances between India and Pakistan that involved cyberspace conflicts, starting in the 1990s.

    "Militant feminist group in Illinois\nWomen Rising in Resistance was a militant feminist group in Illinois in the 1980s. The group emerged after the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment  in 1982. It was formed in 1983 and lasted until 1992.\nPolitical activities\nWhite House protest\nIn 1983, Women Rising in Resistance protested outside the White House as part of a group of over 120 feminists calling for women's rights. The group was protesting the Reagan administration's position on women's rights. The protest was staged on the day marking the 63rd anniversary of the 19th Amendment and women carried banners saying, \"Reagan's war on women fans the flame of women's rage.\" During this protest the activists were physically carried away by the police but no arrests were made.\nStatue of Liberty protest\nIn 1986, Women Rising in Resistance staged a direct action protest at the Statue of Liberty in New York City. During this protest, they dropped on banner on the statue to raise awareness for the need for women's rights. The day of the protest was symbolic because it represented the 100th anniversary of the State of Liberty.\nLesbian rights\nIn the 1980s, under the leadership of Mary Lee Sargent, Women Rising in Resistance advocated for lesbian rights through public protests and publications in the Lavender Prairie News.\nMary Lee Sargent holding a banner in support of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1982\nState level protests\nCalifornia\nIn July 1984, a group of women protested in Santa Cruz against a video story for selling material they felt promoted violence against women.\nIowa\nIn October 1984, 4 women affiliated with Women Rising in Resistance protested pornography in two adult bookstores where they tore up magazines. The group included Kimela Nelson and Melissa Farley who worked as a clinical psychologist. Both women were from Iowa City.\nOhio\nIn Ohio, a group of women calling themselves \"Sisters of Justice\" who were affiliated with Women Rising in Resistance protested against Franklin County Judge Frederick T. Williams. In 1984, three women wearing robes and hoods put a \"curse\" on him and threw glitter while chanting, \"We are cursing you Fred for using your bench (to oppress women). May you feel great pain in your heart such as women do every time your politics interfere with justice.\"\nWisconsin\nIn 1984, a group of men and women affiliated with Women Rising in Resistance staged a public protest against an adult book store to show opposition to pornography.\nMembers\nMary Lee Sargent and Berenice Carroll were both members of Women Rising in Resistance. Before this group was created in 1982, both had been members of the Grassroots Group of Second Class Citizens. Mary Ellen Gard participated in this organization and spoke on behalf of the group in the 1986 liberty protests. Margaret K. Johnson protested in 1984 against the Missouri campaign for Ronald Reagan as part of Women Rising in Resistance. She told the press the group was diverse and consisted of \"...housewives, teachers, accountants, government employees, nurses, doctors and farmers.\"\nSee also\nA Group of Women\nGrassroots Group of Second Class Citizens\nSonia Johnson\nZoe Nicholson\nWomen Hunger for Justice\n",
    "Siege in Denmark, 1369\nFor the siege of Kolding in 1658, see Siege of Kolding (1658).\nThe Siege of Kolding (Danish: Belejringen af Kolding) also known as the Siege of Koldinghus, was a siege by the County of Holstein on the Danish castle of Koldinghus in 1368 during the Danish\u2013Hanseatic War (1361\u20131370). The siege would end inconclusive for both sides, however, the commander of the castle, Peder Ivers\u00f8n, promised to surrender if King Valdemar IV of Denmark would die, abdicate, or lose the kingdom. Presumeably, Ivers\u00f8n surrendered at last, since he would not be mentioned in the later peace talks.\nBackground\nSee also: Battle of Helsingborg (1362) and Confederation of Cologne\nThe Hanseatic League suffered a major military disaster at Helsingborg in 1362, leaving the Danish King, Valdemar, stronger than ever. In November 1367, 77 members of the Hanseatic diet in Cologne, decided to form an alliance-confederation to attack Denmark. The confederation was supported by Count Adolf of Holstein and Albert, King of Sweden. With the support of rebelling Jutish nobles, the Holsteinian army invaded Jutland, where the border fortifications of Ribe and Skodborg fell.\nSiege\nThe Castle of Koldinghus would also be besieged. The castle garrison would defend the city bravely, and the German dukes, Nicholas and Henry, would still be besieging the castle long into 1369. In July 1369 the siege still dragged on, and the dukes had likely tried to attack H\u00f8neborg and Hindsgavl castles, or at least threatened to do so. This resulted in negotiations with the commander of the castles, Peder IVers\u00f8n. The result of these negotiations looked similar to those concluded with Aalholm and Ravnsborg the year before. On 16 July, Ivers\u00f8n sent a letter to the Holsteinian camps, in which he promised if King Valdemar should either lose the kingdom, voluntarily resign it, or die, he would hand over all his castles to the counts. However, if the king came to the kingdom again and demanded the castles back, Ivers\u00f8n would hand them over to him.\nAftermath\nPresumably Koldinghus would fall to the besiegers, since no representatives of Koldinghus were present during the Treaty of Stralsund. Additionally, there is no other historic mentions of Peder Iversen ever again.\nSee also\nSiege of Copenhagen (1368)\u00a0\u2013 Siege and looting of Copenhagen by Hanseatic forces in 1368\nTreaty of Stralsund (1370)\u00a0\u2013 1370 peace treaty between Denmark and the Hanseatic League\nSiege of Helsingborg (1368\u20131369)\u00a0\u2013 Siege in Helsingborg between Swedish, Hanseatic and Danish forces\nSiege of Kolding (1341)\u00a0\u2013 1341 siege in Denmark\n",
    "Kiryat Arbaya is an ancient settlement mentioned in two letters written by Simon Bar Kokhba, discovered in the Cave of Letters in Nahal Hever. The settlement has been proposed to be identified with the Arab village of Al-Arroub south of Gush Etzion or with Khirbet Arbaya nearby, close to the road between Bethlehem and Hebron. This area is located between Ein Gedi and Betar, where Bar Kokhba's main camp was likely situated. The literal meaning of the name is 'City of the Arabs' or \u2013 what might be more plausible in light of the letter's content \u2013 'City of the Willows'. Additionally, some have suggested identifying Kiryat Arbaya from Bar Kokhba's letters with the legend of the birth of the Messiah that appears in the Jerusalem Talmud and in Lamentations Rabbah.\nThe Letter of Four Species\nThe letter is one of Bar Kokhba's letters and was sent to a man named Yehuda Bar Menashe, who resided in Kiryat Arbaya. In the letter, Bar Kokhba instructed Yehuda Bar Menashe to send two men on his behalf to Yonatan Ben Be'aya and Masbala Ben Shimon, commanders of Ein Gedi, along with two donkeys provided by Bar Kokhba himself, to load them with palm branches and citrons, and prepare for Bar Kokhba's camp the four species \u2013 palm branches, citrons, myrtles, and willows \u2013 needed for the upcoming Sukkot holiday. The letter was written in the midst of the fierce fighting against the Romans, apparently towards the end of the revolt, and Bar Kokhba made great efforts to obtain the four species. This letter testifies to the meticulousness of Bar Kokhba's men in observing the commandments. The letter was probably written close to the Sukkot holiday of the year 134 CE, as according to the Mishnah (Taanit, 4, 6) Betar was destroyed on the ninth of Av, and therefore Bar Kokhba was no longer alive during Sukkot of the year 135.\nFollowing Prof. Yadin, other researchers saw this document as evidence of Bar Kokhba's men's adherence to commandments and tithes. Another thing Yadin learned from this letter is about the scarcity of transportation means in Bar Kokhba's army and his lack of confidence in the fulfillment of his orders, which may indicate a loose level of discipline. Aharon Oppenheimer rejected this interpretation, and according to his interpretation, \"Bar Kokhba simply sends a transport unit.\" This interpretation assumes that Bar Kokhba organized the transportation in his army based on a central pool of donkeys.

A) and in the Midrash (Lamentations Rabbah 1, 16): According to this legend, a Jewish man was plowing his field and his cow mooed. An Arab (one Arab) passed by and told him to untie his ox and plow, for the Temple had been destroyed. After the cow mooed a second time, he told him to tie his ox and plow, for at that moment the Messiah king was born. When the plower asked the name of the Messiah and his birthplace, the Arab replied that his name was Menachem Ben Hezekiah, and he was born in 'Bira Malka of Bethlehem Judah' (according to the Jerusalem version) or in 'Bira Arava' according to the Midrash to Lamentations. In the discussion of the entry \"Bira Malka of Bethlehem Judah,\" Samuel Klein discusses the legend of the Sages and suggests that the two names appearing in the two versions were preserved side by side, and Bira Malka should be identified with Khirbet al-Bira, and Bira Arabia with Khirbet Arub. According to Mazar, Kiryat Arabia should be identified with Bira Arava of Bethlehem Judah, mentioned in the Messiah legend, which may be located at Khirbet 'Arib or nearby, between Artas, Bethlehem and Al-'Arrub, near Bethlehem.\nHiding Complex near Ein 'Arrub\nIn the early 1970s, a lar",
    "Debate on which polity represents China\nChinese legitimacy question (Chinese: \u4e2d\u570b\u4ee3\u8868\u6b0a\u554f\u984c) is the question regarding the political legitimacy of representing \"China\", and what polity is considered as \"legitimate government of China\" or \"legitimate representative of China\".\nFrom 1911 to 1949, the representation of \"China\" on the world stage unambiguously belonged to the Republic of China. On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong officially announced the proclamation of the creation of the People's Republic of China. From then on, two distinct polities, the Republic of China (ROC \u2013 which had retreated to Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC \u2013 which now controls mainland China) both claim to be the only legitimate representative of \"China\".\nIn 1971, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2758, where the PRC officially replaced the ROC's former seat at the UN, including its permanent member status at the security council. Since then, most countries in the world formally recognize the PRC as the representative of China, though many still maintain informal relations with the ROC.\nSince the creation of the PRC, the political status of Taiwan has been in dispute. According to the PRC, the UN resolution's recognition of representation extends also to Taiwan, which is why the PRC should be the legitimate representative. However, the ROC disputes this, and historically claimed to be the representative of China in line with its One China principle. However, the government has in recent years been more accepting of the Two Chinas reality based on the 1992 Consensus.\nHistory\nEver since the creation of the Republic of China in 1911, there have been numerous divisions within the government, most notably between the Nanjing government and Beiyang government. There was also the creation of the Chinese Soviet Republic that opposed the rule of the ROC.\nBy 1949, the communist forces in China successfully defeated the nationalist army in the Chinese Civil War, and captured all of mainland China. That same year, the government proclaimed the creation of the People's Republic of China, and has ever since claimed legitimate representation for \"China\", often with the help of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, the Republic of China, which has now fled to Taiwan after losing to the communists, continued to claim legitimacy through its seat at the UN, often with the help of the United States. In the following years, as the number of states recognizing the PRC increased, more states also supported the PRC in gaining representation at the UN. The US once suggested the possibility for dual representation of both the PRC and the ROC at the UN, but received rejection from the PRC.\nIn 1971, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2758, officially recognizing the PRC as the legitimate representative of \"China\". The next year, the PRC and the US held meetings that led to the announcement of the Shanghai communique. In it, the American side \"acknowledges that... there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China\". This solidified the idea of One China, which both the PRC and ROC adhere to, claiming itself to be the sole legitimate representative. The Amreican declaration intentionally left unclear which China the \"China\" represents, signalling the US's continued policy of strategic ambiguity regarding the China issue.\nSince losing its UN seat, the ROC has been less adamant in its claims of \"One China\" and has become more quietly accepting of the two Chinas reality. Today, most call the ROC as \"Taiwan\", reflecting this change in attitude.\nPerspectives\nPRC Perspective\nAccording to the PRC, it has always been the legitimate representative of \"China\" ever since its proclamation in 1949. In addition, it holds that Taiwan is a \"renegade province\" of China, and that the Resolution 2758 passed in 1971 has settled this legitimacy question for both China and Taiwan once and for all.\nROC Perspective\nThe perspective of the ROC has had more change over time than that of the PRC. During the one-party era from 1948 to 1991 in the ROC, the government viewed the PRC and its governing communist party as a rebel group, and viewed itself as the only legitimate representative of China. More recently though, the government has been less resolute in calling itself \"China\", instead either using \"Republic of China\" officially or \"Taiwan\" unofficially. Today, the ROC generally follows a more practical approach to diplomacy, which sees itself less as a representative of all of China, but instead just of Taiwan.\nInternational Community\nThe PRC dictates that any nation which wishes to form diplomatic relations with the PRC must follow its One china principle. This effectively means that any state must choose to recognize either the PRC or ROC, but not both at the same time.\nBesides the around a dozen states that recognizes the ROC, all the other states in the world recognizes the PRC and so, at least partially, adheres to its One China principle.

    "\nThe Pacification of Somalia (in Italian: Pacificazione della Somalia) was an action carried out by the Kingdom of Italy against local rebels including the Dervish Movement. This pacification process lasted from 1889 to 1920, and resulted into the consolidation of Italian Somaliland and the dissolution of the Dervish State.\nHistory of the sultanates in the region\nThroughout the 19th century, the western part of the Horn of Africa was composed of many independent sultanates, including the Sultanate of Hobyo (in Italian: Sultanato di Obbia), the Majeerteen Sultanate (in Italian: Sultanato della Migiurtina), the Hiraab Imamate (in Italian: Imamato di Hirab) and the Sultanate of Geledi (in Italian: Sultanato di Geledi). Particularly, the late 19th century had a huge impact in the Horn of Africa. The Somali Sultans that then controlled the region, such as Yusuf Ali Kenadid, Osman Mahamuud, Ahmed Yusuf, and Olol Dinle opened themselves to protection treaties with one some of the European colonial powers, including Italy. These treaties allowed European powers to gain allies and, gradually, protectorates.\nHistory\nFirst Treaties and Protectorates\nItalian ships sailing in the Suez Canal in 1885\nAfter the Egyptian withdrawal from the Horn of Africa, the Italians negotiated with the British and got themselves a protectorate over the port of Massaua (in Eritrea). This was officially the start of Italy's colonial ambitions.\nAt the end of 1888, Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid had in fact negotiated with the Italians, making his Sultanate of Hobyo the first Italian protectorate in Somalia. The following year, Osman Mahamuud signed a similar agreement for his Majeerteen Sultanate, allowing it to be another Italian protectorate. Both rulers had signed the protectorate treaties to further their own expansionist goals: Kenadid sought to use Italy's support in his dispute with the Sultanate of Zanzibar over the control of the village of Uarsciek, as well as in his ongoing power struggle with Boqor Osman himself. Both Kenadid and his rival Osman hoped to exploit the conflicting interests between the European imperial powers that were trying to take control of the Horn of Africa, while avoiding direct occupation of their territories. The Italians, instead, were interested in the colonies in Somalia mainly because of its ports, which could grant them access to the strategically important Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aden.\nWar of 1887-1889\nMain article: Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889\nBetween 1887 and 1889 Italian and Ethiopian (Abyssinian) forces clashed several times for the control of Eritrea. Despite the many battles lost by the Italians, even tho they inflicted many casualties on the Ethiopians, they besieged Saati and enstablished Italian Eritrea. Minister, Agostino Depretis, died shortly after the defeat in Dogali in July 1887 and was replaced by Francesco Crispi. On 2 May 1889, the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II and Italy signed the Treaty of Wuchale, ending the war as a compromise.\nCoastal possessions until 1920\nPrince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi\nAn hotel in Villabruzzi\nAfter more treaties, Italy gained control of the ports of the Benadir coastal area from the Sultanate of Zanzibar and its Sultan, and over the following decades, Italian power over the settlement was strengthened and, in 1905, Italy assumed the responsibility of colonizing parts in southern Somalia. The administrative regulator, at that time, was Governor Mercantelli, who divided the colony into the six regions of Brava, Merca, Lugh, Itala, Bardera, and Jumbo. Following the assassination of an Italian Lieutenant by anti-colonial Somali rebels, Italian troops razed all villages near the river Shabeelle and its shores while seizing livestock and killing Somali residents in the area.\n1911 map showing the situation in Somalia\nOn 5 April 1908, the Italian Parliament enacted a basic law to unite all of the parts of southern Somalia into an area called Somalia Italiana. This system controlled export rights, regulated the rate of exchange, raised or lowered native taxes, and administered all civil services and matters relating to hunting, fishing, and conservation. The governor of Somalia Italiana was also in control of the police force, while nominating local residents and military arrangements.\nFrom 5 April 1908 to 5 May 1936, the Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops (in Italian: Regio corpo truppe coloniali della Somalia Italiana), originally called the \"Guard Corps of Benadir\", served as the territory's formal military corps. At the start of its establishment, the force had 2,600 Italian officers but, between 1911 and 1912, over 1,000 Somalis (Dubats) from Mogadishu served as combat units along with Eritrean and Italian soldiers during the Italo-Turkish War and the First and Second Ethiopian wars. Effective Italian control in Somalia remained largely limited to the coastal areas until the early 1920s, when the Pacification of the Inner lands began.\nClashes and op",

It is an official civil diplomatic organization established by the Government of the People's Republic of China between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation. Its predecessor was the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association/China-Soviet Union Friendship Association, founded on October 5, 1949, or CRAFA for short.\nHistory\nChina-Soviet Union Friendship Association\nOn October 5, 1950, the first anniversary of the founding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, attended by Soong Ching Ling, Luoshin, Liu Shaoqi and Li Jishen.\nBefore the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Communist regime of China held the launching meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Huairen Hall, Zhongnanhai, Beiping. According to the constitution of the association, the first \"leadership core\" was elected by the inaugural meeting, with Liu Shaoqi as president, Song Qingling, Wu Yuzhang, Shen Junru, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Zhang Lan and Huang Yanpei as vice-presidents, and the director-general, Qian Junrui, designated as the director-general. By April 1950, the Association had established branches in most provinces of China. By October 1952, the Association had become the largest mass organization in China at that time, with a membership of 38.9 million, and by the beginning of 1953, the Association had more than 68 million members.\nIn the mid-to-late 1950s, the Association was also affected by the Sino-Soviet split, and in February 1960, the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party handed over the General Party Group of the Association to the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council. In August 1960, the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council transferred the General Committee of the Association to the State Committee for Liaison with Foreign Cultures, which was renamed the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Cultures (the predecessor of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries) and co-located with the General Committee of the Association in 1965, and on September 17, 1966, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was merged into the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. On September 17, 1966, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was renamed the Sino-Soviet People's Friendship Association under CPAFFC framework.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the General Association was dissolved on its own. After the establishment of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, the Association became one of its sub-groups and no longer retained its local organization, and in 1983 it resumed the exchange of visits with the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. In 1984, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association elected a new president, Qu Wu, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic Revolutionary Party.\nChina-Russia Friendship Association\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was renamed the China-Russia Friendship Association. On October 28, 2009, a conference celebrating the 60th anniversary of the China-Russia Friendship Association was held at the Moscow Institute of International Relations.\nOn March 18, 2011, the Fifth Council of the China-Russia Friendship Association was held in Beijing.\nSee also\nRussia-China Friendship Association (Russian: \u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0431\u044b)\nReference\n^ Lukin, A.

    "Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed noviny (lit. Literary newspaper) was a Czech cultural and political monthly newspaper. The last issue was published on May 28, 2020.\nHistory\nThe first issue was published in 1927. In the 1960s, Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed noviny had a great influence on the gradual liberalization of Czechoslovak society. In the fall of 1967, the leadership of the Communist Party tried to slow down liberalization and stopped publishing Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed noviny. This essentially provoked a clash with the liberal wing of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Czech Republic, which was joined by Stalinists dissatisfied with the leadership of Anton\u00edn Novotny. Publication of Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed noviny was halted a total of 3 times during the 1960s. By administrative intervention in 1967, by the decision of the editors in connection with the invasion of August 1968, and finally in May 1969. According to the original plan, Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed noviny was to be published from October 1968 as a daily of creative associations, Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed listy as their supplement with a weekly period.\nLiter\u00e1rn\u00ed noviny, as a weekly of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers, was published in 1968 under the name Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed listy (February 22, 1968 \u2013 August 15, 1968), then as Listy (November 7, 1968 \u2013 May 15, 1969). Circulation in June 1968 reached 300,000 copies. Du\u0161an Ham\u0161\u00edk was the editor-in-chief from February to May 1968, followed by Milan Jungmann until List\u016f was stopped. Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk, Karel Kos\u00edk, Ji\u0159\u00ed Lederer, Milan Kundera, V\u00e1clav Havel, Helena Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, Ivan Kl\u00edma, Pavel Kohout, Jan Proch\u00e1zka, Alexandr Kliment, Petr Pithart, Jaroslav Put\u00edk, Eduard Goldst\u00fccker, Vladim\u00edr Karf\u00edk, Sergej Machonin, A.J. contributed to them. Liehm, Milan H\u00fcbl, V\u00e1clav Klaus, Vladim\u00edr Bla\u017eek, Igor H\u00e1jek, Anton\u00edn Brousek, Petr Chudo\u017eilov, Milan \u0160ime\u010dka, Miroslava Rektorisov\u00e1, Jaroslav \u0160ediv\u00fd, Ji\u0159\u00ed Mucha, Franti\u0161ka Faktorov\u00e1, Josef V\u00e1lka, etc. Literary newspapers were one of the important platforms for intellectual discussion in the 1960s, including the period of the Prague Spring. The tradition of Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed noviny was followed by the exiled Listy, a magazine of the Czechoslovak socialist opposition led by Ji\u0159\u00ed Pelik\u00e1n, now published in the Czech Republic (www.listy.cz).\nRenewal after 1989\nAlthough the name indicates a literary magazine, the essence of the tradition of Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed noviny consisted rather in the participation of writers and intellectuals in social discussion and in the concept of literature as a living social organism that is closely related to other arts, sciences and politics. The literary newspaper was revived after the Velvet Revolution in November 1989. The first two volumes were published as a supplement to Lidov\u00e9 noviny. They have been published independently since 1992.\nDuring the 1990s, a focus on literature in a more academic sense prevailed. After Jakub Pato\u010dka, the co-founder of the DUHA Movement and the editor-in-chief of the socio-ecological magazine Sedm\u00e1 \u017een\u00e1\u0159e Jakub Pato\u010dka, became the head of the editorial office, the newspaper expanded to include an ecological-political accent, and the often radical tone of the comments in this field caused numerous controversies. In 2004, in protest against Jakub Pato\u010dka's little interest in managing the magazine, eleven editors left his editorial office. However, Jakub Pato\u010dka remained as editor-in-chief until the end of 2009.\nSince 2001, the Michael Koc\u00e1b Foundation for the Support of Literature has been among the patrons of Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed noviny.\nAfter the Society for Literary Newspapers, the Brno Center for Media and Democracy took over publishing of the newspaper in mid-2007. Since February 2009, the publisher has been Pr\u00e1vo, solidarita an inform\u00e1ci\u00f3s o.s. led by Jan Ml\u00e1dek, which handed over publishing to Litmedia in the same year. The majority owner was Miroslav Pavel, director of Czechoslovak Television in the period 27/11/1989 \u2013 10/1/1990 and former spokesman of the two communist prime ministers Lubom\u00edr \u0160trougal and Ladislav Adamec. The editor-in-chief was Zbyn\u011bk Fiala. After the takeover, many editors and other employees left the paper, the predominant reason being the reluctance to cooperate with former communist secret service agents who worked in LN.\nIn June 2010, Petr B\u00edlek, who previously ran Reflex magazine, became the editor-in-chief. Today Liter\u00e1rn\u00ed noviny mainly deals with political, economic and general social topics. The special supplement to the New Book was abolished. Contributors to the weekly include, for example, Tereza Spencerov\u00e1, Ale\u0161 Bluma, Zbyn\u011bk Fiala, Josef Bro\u017e or Petr B\u00edlek. In 2017, the Academy of Literary Newspapers was established, which aimed to further educate those interested in contemporary Czech and world literature, the world of media and creative writing in the form of seminars and lectures.\nAt the beginning of 2020, journalists from Aktualn\u011b.cz accused LN of \"spreading communist propaganda\" because they cooperated with one of the largest Chinese state newspapers, Kuang-ming z'-pao.\nEconomic prob",

    "Former Italian bank\nNot to be confused with Banco di Roma, Banca di Roma, or Bank of Romania.\nPalazzo Maffei Marescotti, seat of the Bank of the Papal States then the Banca Romana from 1865 to 1893\nThe Banca Romana (lit.\u2009'Roman Bank') was an Italian bank of issue founded in Rome in 1834. In 1850 it was reorganized as the Bank of the Papal States (Italian: Banca dello Stato Pontificio), which in 1870 itself changed its name to Banca Romana. In the late 1880s, its difficulties developed into the major Banca Romana scandal which shook Italy's political life and triggered the creation in 1893 of the Bank of Italy. The Bank of Italy managed the Banca Romana's subsequent liquidation.\nHistory\nBanca Romana in the Papal States\nThe Banca Romana was established in Rome in 1834 by French and Belgian investors, with the privilege of issuing money in the Papal States granted by Pope Gregory XVI. In 1841, control of the Bank was acquired by a group of Roman financiers led by the Agostino Feoli with financial support from the Cassa di Risparmio di Roma.\nDuring the political upheavals of 1848, the bank encountered a serious liquidity crisis caused by a bank run. To deal with the crisis, in April 1848, the government ordered the suspension of the convertibility of banknotes and their circulation as legal tender for three months, a measure that was then renewed several times. In order to support public confidence in the value of the banknotes, it was envisaged to guarantee their convertibility into Treasury bonds with a mortgage on ecclesiastical assets. Simultaneously, the bank's issuing privilege was limited to 800,000 scudi.\nDuring the Roman Republic (1849\u20131850), the Republican government ordered the bank to print currency for 1.5 million scudi in order to finance the public treasury. Subsequently, in December 1849, the Papal Government cancelled these banknotes, but compensated the holders with public debt securities of equal value. At the same time, not wanting to recognize the debt contracted by the Republic, the government expressed its intent to seek compensation from the bank's assets, effectively triggering its bankruptcy given insufficient own funds. In consideration of the systemic repercussions that would be produced, the Papal government eventually backtracked, however, and, as part of an overall restructuring plan, decreed the incorporation of the Banca Romana's remaining assets and liabilities into a newly formed bank of issue.\nBank of the Papal States\nLike the prior Banca Romana, the Bank of the Papal States was founded in the form of a joint-stock company. In 1855, given difficulties experienced by the new bank, the convertibility of its banknotes was again suspended, and its branches in Romagna were spun off to form a now bank of issue, the Bank of the Four Legations\u00a0. With the advance of Italian unification, The latter was absorbed in 1860\u20131861 by the National Bank of the Sardinian States.\nBanca Romana in the Kingdom of Italy\nMain article: Banca Romana scandal\nAfter the capture of Rome on 20 September 1870, the Bank of the Papal States renamed itself again as Banca Romana. On 24 October 1870, it signed a secret agreement with the National Bank of the Kingdom of Italy (as the National Bank of the Sardinian States had renamed itself in the meantime) under which it renounced the monopoly on money issuance it had in Papal Latium against a significant financial indemnity, which ironically resolved the mounting financial distress that the Papal States had been experiencing in the previous years as an independent polity. As a consequence, the Banca Romana found itself one of six banks of issue in the unified Kingdom of Italy, together with the Banco di Napoli, Banco di Sicilia, Banca Nazionale Toscana, Banca Toscana di Credito, and the National Bank of the Kingdom of Italy.\nThe Banca Romana scandal precipitated the merger of the latter three to form the Bank of Italy in 1893. The Bank of Italy in turn was tasked with liquidating the Banca Romana in an orderly manner.\nLeadesrhip\nCount Filippo Antonelli, Governor of the Bank of the Papal States 1852-1870\nGiuseppe Guerrini, Governor of the Banca Romana 1870\u20131881\nBernardo Tanlongo\u00a0, Governor 1881-1893\nSee also\nBanco di Santo Spirito\nInstitute for the Works of Religion\nNotes\n^ Enzo Magri (1993), I ladri di Roma. 1893 scandalo della Banca Romana: politici, giornalisti, eroi del Risorgimento all'assalto del denaro pubblico, Milan: Mondadori\n^ Luigi De Matteo (2001), Il Banco di Santo Spirito from its origins to 1960 (PDF), Banca di Roma\n^ a b Francesco Margiotta Broglio (25 August 2019). \"Pio IX rest\u00f2 escluso dall'euro dell'800  Ma Porta Pia evit\u00f2 la bancarotta\".

    "Species of lichen\nXanthoparmelia alligatensis is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae, described by John Elix in 2006. The species is native to South Australia, specifically found in the Mount Remarkable National Park.\nTaxonomy\nXanthoparmelia alligatensis was formally described by John Elix in 2006. The type specimen was collected in Australia within the Mount Remarkable National Park at Alligator Gorge, located 9\u00a0km south of Wilmington, South Australia, at an elevation of 600\u00a0metres. The specimen was collected on 17 May 2003 from sandstone rocks amidst Eucalyptus woodland accompanied by Allocasuarina, Callitris, Acacia, and Xanthorrhoea.\nThe specific epithet alligatensis is derived from the Latin suffix ensis, meaning \"place of origin\", combined with \"Alligator\", referencing Alligator Gorge, the type locality where the species was first identified.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Xanthoparmelia alligatensis is foliose, loosely adnate to the substrate, and can reach up to 8\u00a0cm in diameter. Its lobes are separate to slightly overlapping (imbricate), measuring 1.5\u20133.5\u00a0mm in width, with more or less linear to somewhat irregular shapes that can form subdichotomous branches. The lobe tips can be either more or less round or incised.\nThe upper surface of the thallus is initially grey to grey-green and darkens as it ages, becoming flat to weakly convoluted, dull, and rugose in the centre while remaining shiny and black-margined at the lobe tips. The surface lacks soredia and isidia, which are structures involved in reproduction and dispersal.\nThe lower surface is smooth, ranging from ivory to brown, and darker towards the lobe tips. Rhizines (root-like structures beneath the lichen) are sparse, short, slender, and colour-coordinated with the lower surface.\nReproductive structures are limited to somewhat stipitate apothecia (fruiting bodies), which are 1\u20137\u00a0mm wide, with a mid-brown to dark brown disc. The lichen produces ellipsoidal ascospores measuring 9\u201312 by 5\u20136\u00a0\u03bcm.\nChemistry\nXanthoparmelia alligatensis has no reaction to potassium hydroxide solution (K\u2212) on the cortex, and a KC + (rose) reaction on the medulla, indicating the presence of isousnic acid as a major lichen product, alongside norlobaridone and minor quantities of various scabrosin derivatives.\nHabitat and distribution\nThis lichen is found exclusively in the Mount Remarkable National Park, particularly around Alligator Gorge. It grows on sandstone surfaces within Eucalyptus woodlands, often accompanied by shrubby vegetation such as Allocasuarina, Callitris, Acacia, and Xanthorrhoea.\nSee also\nList of Xanthoparmelia species\n",

    "\nThe 1951 Panamanian coup d'\u00e9tat was the overthrow in Panama of the second Arnulfo Arias Madrid administration by dissident armed forces, led by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rem\u00f3n, Commander of the militarized National Police. Following a few days of turmoil, he was arrested and replaced by Vice President Alcibiades Arosemena.\nBackground\nArnulfo Arias Madrid, a surgeon and physician educated in the United States, was elected President of Panama in October 1940. His initial tenure was cut short however, when he was deposed in a bloodless coup in 1941. Following his overthrow, a string of provisional governments led the country until elections were held in 1948. After spending years in exile, Arias Madrid returned to Panama and ran in the 1948 Panama general election, unofficially winning a majority of the votes. However, the official count disqualified enough votes for Arias to hand victory to his opponent, Domingo Diaz Arosemena. After suffering a heart attack, Arosemena resigned, dying less than a month later. Following his death, Daniel Chanis succeeded him as provisional president. Due to Chanis' attempts to remove police chief Jos\u00e9 A. Rem\u00f3n, he was deposed of. In November 1949, Arias Madrid was installed as president, with Remon leveraging the unofficial results of the 1948 election to legitimize the coup.\nDuring his administration, President Arias faced intense opposition due to his past regime and return to power, exacerbated by political blunders in early 1950 which led to further dissatisfaction and opposition to the government. His honeymoon period with the police chief also ended as his authority and actions began gaining more scrutiny. As a result, President Arias considered doing drastic measures such as dissolving the National Assembly and Supreme court. In his February 1951 speech, he criticized the assembly, which had increasingly opposed him over time.\nInternationally, President Arias sought to align the country closely with the United States, supporting democracy and opposing communism. These efforts to ingratiate himself with the west were aimed at securing his presidency and power. The Truman administration promptly recognized the new government, lifting the diplomatic sanctions it had imposed earlier.\nCoup attempt\nOn May 7, 1951, President Arias dissolved the National Assembly and suspended the 1946 Constitution, restoring the more authoritarian constitution from his previous short-lived term in 1941. His maneuver to consolidate power sparked widespread demonstrations and a general strike. The National Assembly voted in favor of his impeachment. By the following day, protesters and armed dissidents had surrounded the Presidential Palace, resulting in violent clashes with government forces. On May 10, President Arias surrendered and was arrested. He was replaced by his vice president, Alcibiades Arosemena, by the National Assembly on the same day. In the end, sixteen people had been killed during the political violence of early May.\n",

    "Welsh Liberal Democrats frontbench team (2003\u20132008)\nMike German, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrat Group in the National Assembly for Wales, formed his second frontbench team of party spokespeople on 8 May 2003 after the dissolution of his party's coalition government with Rhodri Morgan's Welsh Labour following the 2003 National Assembly for Wales election. Richards had already formed a frontbench team before entering coalition, when his party became an opposition party after the 1999 National Assembly for Wales election before forming the coalition with Labour in October 2000.\nGerman continued to serve as leader of his party's group until his resignation in 2008. A year earlier, he was elected leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats with the group leadership unified with this office. Kirsty Williams won a leadership election to succeed him as leader in December 2008 and she formed a new frontbench team later that same month.\nBackground\nMike German was elected leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrat Group in the National Assembly for Wales in 1998 ahead of the first assembly election in 1999. He led the party into the election, where it won six seats and returned six assembly members (AMs), a result which was repeated in the 2003 and 2007 assembly elections. At the 1999 election, German won a regional assembly seat in South Wales East, leading the Welsh Liberal Democrat Group in the assembly following its establishment later that same year. The Liberal Democrats served in opposition during the first year of the assembly, with German forming his first frontbench team on 13 May 1999. In October 2000, German negotiated a coalition deal with First Secretary Rhodri Morgan and his party formed a coalition government with Morgan's Welsh Labour.\nMorgan's Labour Party made gains at the 2003 assembly election and so he decided to end the coalition with German's Liberal Democrats. As a result, the Liberal Democrats returned to opposition. Morgan formed a new cabinet for his Labour government on 8 May 2003. After the appointment of Morgan's new cabinet, the opposition parties in the assembly appointed new frontbench teams, including a reshuffled shadow cabinet for Plaid Cymru, a reshuffled frontbench team for the Welsh Conservatives and a new frontbench team for the Liberal Democrats who had just left government.\nHistory\nLike the other opposition parties, German formed his frontbench team of party spokespeople after the formation of Morgan's new cabinet on 8 May 2003. All members of the Welsh Liberal Democrat Group were given a portfolio. Kirsty Williams was appointed as the group's business manager and chief whip and as its spokesperson for health and social services. Other appointments included Jenny Randerson as spokesperson for finance and spokesperson for economic development and transport, Peter Black as spokesperson for education and spokesperson for social justice, Mick Bates as spokesperson for environment, planning and the countryside, and Eleanor Burnham as spokesperson for culture, sport and Welsh language.\nFollowing the 2007 National Assembly for Wales election and the collapse of coalition talks between the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Lembit \u00d6pik stood down to unify the posts of party leader and leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrat Group in the National Assembly. German stood unopposed in the leadership election to succeed him in October 2007, becoming the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats with his previous role as group leader merged into the office. German announced in May 2008 his intention to resign from the leadership later that year after the party's annual conference in October. A leadership election was held on 8 December 2008 to elect a successor, with Kirsty Williams defeating Jenny Randerson to become the new leader.

    "\nKazTransGas is a Kazakhstani state owned natural gas transportation company headquartered in Astana. It is a subsidiary of the national oil and gas company KazMunayGas. It is the largest gas supply company in Kazakhstan, representing the state's interests in both the domestic and international gas markets.\nHistory\nKazTransGas was founded in 2000 as a subsidiary of KazMunayGas to manage Kazakhstan's natural gas pipeline infrastructure. The company is responsible for the operation and development of the country's gas pipeline network, which transports natural gas from production fields to domestic consumers and for export\nIn 2006, KazTransGas acquired Tbilisi, a gas distributor. However, in 2009, the management rights of the company were transferred away by the Georgian Government. In March 2018, Georgian Industrial Group announced its acquisition of KazTransGas Tbilisi, a subsidiary company of KazTransGas, for $40 million.\nOn May 12, 2023, KazTransGas (KTG) Aimak launched a 60-kilometer underground high-pressure gas pipeline in the Mangystau Region, connecting Kuryk village with Sarsha and the Warm Beach resort near Aktau to support resort development and address regional water scarcity.\nOperations\nKazTransGas operates a vast network of natural gas pipelines throughout Kazakhstan, including major transmission pipelines and distribution networks. It is the sole operator of the country's gas transportation system and facilitates the transit of natural gas to neighbouring countries such as Russia, China, and Central Asia.\nThe Kazakhstan section of Bukhara\u2013Tashkent\u2013Bishkek\u2013Almaty pipeline is operated by KazTransGas.\nIn December 2015, KazTransGas completed the third branch (C branch) of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline, adding to a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters per year. The 1,303-kilometer pipeline project employed over 4,000 specialists and received $1.2 billion in state funding from 2008 to 2015. It forms part of the larger 7,500-kilometer Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Kazakhstan-China pipeline, traversing South Kazakhstan, Zhambyl, and Almaty regions.\nAllegations\nIn December 2020, following the appointment of Kairat Sharipbaev as chairman of KazTransGas, Sharipbaev faced allegations of potential Conflict of interest. An investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on indirect ties between Sharipbaev and companies that subsequently received major contracts from KazTransGas and the Government of Kazakhstan.  A key point of contention was the awarding of an $860 million contract to construct a gas processing plant to GPC Investment, a firm with reported links to a business associate of Sharipbaev. The report further raised concerns about the selection process, which favored GPC Investment over established international energy companies.\n",
    "Australian journalist (1891 \u2013 1977)\nAda Jean Hounsell Williamson better known as Jean Williamson (31 October 1891 \u2013 14 January 1977) was an Australian journalist. When The Australian Women's Weekly was becoming a best selling magazine known for its light fiction, she was in charge of the light fiction.\nLife\nWilliamson was born in 1891 in Belmont, New South Wales. Her parents were Ada Mary Theobald (born Hannell) and John Alexander Williamson. She was the first of their five children. After a private education she began contributing articles as a freelance to newspapers and the Australian Town and Country Journal. She obtained her first job running the women's part of the Farmer and Settler newspaper in 1916.\nShe worked at the Sydney Morning Herald where Florence Baverstock was the social editor and one of Australia's first women staff journalists who ran the newspaper's women's section from 1914. At one point Williamson was sacked because of her absenteeism. She wrote a letter apologising for her unreliability and noting that she had recently lost her fianc\u00e9e. The letter was accepted, and when Florence Baverstock retired from the women's section in 1918, then Williamson was her successor.\nThe Australian Women's Weekly was started in 1933 by Frank Packer and Ted Theodore with George Warnecke as the first editor. The newspaper's features were designed to be topical, Australian and to appeal to all Australian women. Warnecke hoped The Weekly would be a sign that Australia finally was coming out of the Depression. Williamson was hired in June 1933 (moving from the Sydney Morning Herald) where she was surprised to find that she was the editor for \"fiction\" and her column was called \"New Books\". Soon letters were arriving from women who were obviously lonely and they were enjoying light fiction. Warnecke went abroad in 1934 and Alice Jackson became the de facto editor.\nBy 1936 Williamson was one the best known women journalists and when The Daily Telegraph in Sydney was relaunched they appointed \"Ten Brilliant Editors\" and Williamson was one of them. She was chosen because of her understanding of what women wanted and because she understood newspapers. She worked on the Telegraph, but then returned to \"The Weekly\" where she continued her successful formula. The Weekly became a leading publisher of light fiction. Australian authors included Margot Neville, Mary Gilmore, Lennie Lower and Henrietta Drake-Brockman.\nShe was a member of the Institute of Journalists and in 1953 she was the honorary secretary.\nWilliamson died in 1977 in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield.\n",
    "Organization for camera clubs and individuals in Canada\nThe Canadian Association for Photographic Art (CAPA) is an organization of regional and other camera clubs, as well as individuals, in Canada and around the world. It was established in 1998 as a result of the merger of the National Association of Photographic Arts (NAPA) and the Colour Photographic Association of Canada (CPAC). Its major interest is to serve Canadian photographers. The association aims \"to promote the art and science of photography in all its forms throughout Canada and the world\". It is headquartered in Salmon Arm, British Columbia.\nHistory\nThe Colour Photographic Association of Canada (CPAC) was formed in May 1947 in Toronto. CPAC grew to sponsor conventions on colour photogrpaphy beginning in 1953.\nIn 1967, the desire to promote all aspects of photography, including black and white imagery, was beyond the scope and interests of CPAC. This led to the formation of the National Association for Photographic Art (NAPA) in December 1967. NAPA sponsored conferences, exhibitions, and competitions.\nIn 1996, the boards of NAPA and CPAC agreed that a single organization would better serve the needs of Canadian photographers and photographic clubs. The two clubs worked together to merge, and established the Canadian Association for Photographic Art in 1998.\nCanadian Camera\nNAPA began publishing Camera Canada. It later evolved into Fotoflash Journal, and finally became Canadian Camera, published quarterly.\nRegional organization\nCAPA is organized into five regional zones:\nAtlantic Zone\ncomprising 4 provinces: New Brunswick, Newfoundland & Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.\nQuebec Zone\ncomprising 4 districts: Montreal, Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, Laurentides, and Capitale-Nationale (Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches).\nOntario Zone\ncomprising 10 districts: Southwestern Ontario \u2013 Area 1, Southwestern Ontario \u2013 Area 2, Niagara Region, Toronto, Belleville \u2013 Bancroft, Kingston Region, Northwestern Ontario, Eastern Ontario Region, \"The Sault\" Region, and Western Ontario Region.\nPrairie Zone\ncomprising 4 provinces: Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Northwest Territories.\nPacific Zone\ncomprising British Columbia and Yukon.\n",
    "Russian courtier (1809\u20131893)\nPrincess Zinaida Ivanovna Yusupova, born Naryshkina (Russian: \u0417\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0438\u0434\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u042e\u0441\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430; 14 November 1810 \u201316 October 1893) was a Russian aristocrat and socialite. She redecorated the Moika Palace to its current style, as well as the Yusupov Dacha in Tsarskoye Selo. She was a recipient of the Order of Theresa.\nFrom 1861, she was known as the Countess de Chauveau.\nBiography\nFamily\nBorn in Moscow in 1810 to chamberlain Ivan Dimitrievich Naryshkin and Varvara Nikolaevna Ladomirskaia, Princess Zinaida was a member of the noble Naryshkin family. Among her ancestors were Natalia Naryshkina, mother to Peter the Great. Her maternal grandfather was Catherine the Great's favourite, Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov. Her granddaughter and namesake was the heiress Zinaida Yusupova, and her great-grandson Felix Yusupov, Rasputin's murderer.\nZinaida and her brother Dimitri received a good education, which prompted the former's interest in poetry and art. Later, she continued the art collection of her parents-in-law.\nFirst marriage\nAs a young girl, Zinaida was made a lady-in-waiting to the new tsarina, Charlotte of Prussia. During the coronation of Nicholas I in 1826, 15-year-old Zinaida caught the eye of 32-year-old widower Boris Nikolaevich Yusupov, known as Borinka to intimates, who became determined to marry her.\nAfter being delayed at the request of Boris' mother, the pair wed on 19 January 1827 in Moscow. The wedding was somewhat chaotic, as Boris had to return home to collect his father's blessing and Zinaida Ivanovna dropped the ring during the ceremony and it could not be relocated. Another ring had to be procured.\nThe young princess soon lost interest in the marriage, however, writing to her father that she was \"very bored in Saint Petersburg\". Alexander Turgenev called her a \"chained Zephyr\" and said \"She is still a piece of poetry, while her husband resembles despicable proze.\"\nAlmost nine months exactly after the wedding, Zinaida gave birth to a son, Nikolai. In 1829, Zinaida gave birth to a stillborn daughter named Anastasia. After this tragic incident, marital relations ceased between Zinaida and Boris. \nIn 1840\nAffairs\nZinaida Ivanovna was noted by her contemporaries for her intelligence and beauty. Prince Meshchersky called her \"one of Saint Peterburg's lionesses\", while Countess Dolly de Ficquelmont gave the following description: \"tall, thin, with a charming waist and a perfectly shaped head. She has lively black eyes and a lively face with a lovely expression that suits her so well.\"\nIn 1830, Princess Zinaida began an affair with cavalry officer Nikolai Gervais (1807\u20131841). Countess de Ficquelmont wrote: \"With surprising simplicity, she gave in to the strength of her feelings.  At every ball, she behaves as though she and Gervais are the only ones in the world. He is very young, with an unattractive face, but he is very much in love, sensitive and perhaps more capable than he is given credit for.\"\nSoon enough, Zinaida's husband found out, which deeply saddened him. To put rumours to an end, Gervais left Saint Petersburg. He died in 1841 aged only 35 while on an expedition in Chechnya. The tsarina, Zinaida's former mistress, wrote that she let out \"two sighs over Gervais, over his overly loyal heart, that has continued to beat for Zinaida until his death.\"\nIn his memoirs, Zinaida's great-grandson Felix Yusupov also described \"a romantic attachment for a young revolutionary whom she followed to Finland where he was interned in the Sveaborg Fortress. She bought a house on a hill facing the prison in order to be able to gaze at her beloved's window from her room.\" He also claimed that, in 1846, Zinaida had an affair with Emperor Nicholas I. However, in the same book, Yusupov claims that his great-grandmother died at a hundred years old in 1897, which is factually incorrect, so the validity of his claims can be called into question. He also stated that in 1925, Bolsheviks discovered a hidden room behind Zinaida's bedroom in her house in Paris, which contained a coffin and a male skeleton.\nSecond marriage\nZinaida's second husband\nIn 1849, Prince Boris died, and Zinaida moved to Parc des Princes in Paris. She was a popular hostess there, and the future Napoleon III tried to court her, to no results. At a ball there, she met Louis Charles Honor\u00e9 Chauveau (1829\u20131889), a staff captain of the National Guard twenty years her junior. On 7 May 1861, they wed in the chapel of her house on Liteyny Avenue in Saint Petersburg. On the wedding document, the couple gave their ages as 46 and 32, when Zinaida was in fact fifty. To make the marriage seem more appropriate, Zinaida procured the titles of Count of Chauveau and Marquis de Serre for her new husband. From 1860, he was also the overseer of the Finist\u00e8re district for Emperor Napoleon III.\nIn 1862, Zinaida bought the Ch\u00e2teau de Keriolet for her husband. During their marriage, Louis-Charles had a long-term affair with Jeanne Ducos, daughter of Th\u00e9odore D",
    "Cameroonian economist and writer (1943\u20132024)\nDaniel Etounga-Manguelle (20 January 1943 \u2013 5 June 2024) was a Cameroonian economist and writer. His work L\u2019Afrique a-t-elle besoin d'un programme d\u2019ajustement culturel\u00a0? led to his rise to fame through his African economic doctrine.\nBiography\nBorn in Makak on 20 January 1943, Etounga-Manguelle studied in Yaound\u00e9 and Douala before pursuing postgraduate studies in France. He earned his engineering degree from the \u00c9cole nationale de l'aviation civil and a doctorate in economic planning from the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes. After his studies, he worked as a consultant for an American firm and subsequently founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 africaine d'\u00e9tude, d'exploitation et de gestion in Cameroon in 1989. He assisted numerous businesses in economic development, management, and financial strategy.\nEtounga-Manguelle began his literary career in 1985 with the book Cent ans d\u2019ali\u00e9nation. He discussed the problems of underdeveloped, which he largely pinned on the Berlin Conference and the dismissal of the local knowledge of African subsistence farmers. His flagship work was published in 1991 and titled L\u2019Afrique a-t-elle besoin d\u2019un programme d\u2019ajustement culturel? and proposed early questions on the sustainable development of Africa. The book was published by Editions Nouvelles du Sud and denounced the cultural defects hampering development efforts in African countries. It encouraged African states to look within at their lack of economic success through the behavior of citizens and their leaders. His 1997 book Pour reconstruire et moderniser le Cameroun, on va faire comment? examined the case for African development from the perspective of Cameroon. In 2004, he published Cameroun\u00a0: une exception africaine\u00a0?, which made a case for land development in his home nation. He emphasized his advocacy for individual responsibility in Vers une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 responsable\u00a0: le cas de l'Afrique (2009). He further denounced the crisis of civilization in Africa.\nEtounga-Manguelle died in Abidjan on 5 June 2024, at the age of 81.\nPublications\nEssays\nCent ans d\u2019ali\u00e9nation (1985)\nL'Afrique a-t-elle besoin d'un programme d'ajustement culturel\u00a0?

    "Ukrainian poet, Soviet dissident, and human rights activist (1929\u20131991)\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is  Mykhailovych and the family name is  Krasivskyi.\nZenovii Mykhailovych Krasivskyi (Ukrainian: \u0417\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0456\u0439 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0301\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0456\u0301\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439; 12 November 1929 \u2013 20 September 1991), also spelled Zenovij Krasivskyj, was a Ukrainian poet, Soviet dissident, and human rights activist. He was a member of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, and in the last year of his life the leader of the Banderite wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists within Ukraine.\nEarly life and first arrest\nZenovii Mykhailovych Krasivskyi was born on 12 November 1929, in the village of Witwica, in the Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic (now Vytvytsia in Ukraine's Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast). His family supported the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, and his older brothers were members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. This influenced his worldview and attitudes towards Ukrainian nationalism.\nKrasivskyi's family was deported to the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic by the Soviet government in 1947 or 1948. Rather than following them, Zenovii fled to the Carpathian Mountains, where he lived illegally until he was badly injured, upon which he moved to Lviv. In 1949 he was arrested, and tried by the NKVD. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment in Arkhangelsk Oblast and forbidden from ever returning to Ukraine.\nAmnesty\nKrasivskyi was released as part of the amnesty of 1953, and allowed to visit his family in Karaganda. There, he worked as a miner, and partook in the opening of Ukrainian-language schools and book stores in the city. During his time as a miner, he sustained several injuries, including being buried under rubble and injured in an explosion, and as a result suffered damage to his spine and paralysis in his legs. He was formally recognised as an invalid and given a pension. He began studying journalism at the University of Lviv in 1956, but was arrested in 1959 and accused of having pursued nationalist activities while in Karaganda. In particular, he was accused of having organised Greek Catholic religious ceremonies in prison camps, having organised Ukrainian-language classes, smuggling books from Ukraine, and organising dance halls. According to a letter he wrote upon his entry to the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, he managed to avoid a trial and was allowed to return to Ukraine, as his invalid status meant he was no longer required to be a special settler.\nKrasivskyi first married music teacher Stefania Yurovych in 1960 and had his first son, Yaroslav, the same year. During this time, he may have met and interacted with Viacheslav Chornovil, who was then an employee at Lviv Television (now Suspilne Lviv\u00a0), as part of his studies. Chornovil would go on to emerge as the leader of Ukraine's dissidents. Krasivskyi moved to Morshyn in 1963. He had a second son, Myroslav, the next year, and later divorced Yurovych.\nIn 1964, amidst the Khrushchev Thaw, Krasivskyi established the Ukrainian National Front\u00a0, an underground Ukrainian nationalist organisation. He wrote for the UNF's journal, Freedom and Fatherland (Ukrainian: \u0412\u043e\u043b\u044f \u0456 \u0431\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, romanized:\u00a0Volia i batkivshchyna), and took up samvydav writing, creating the novel Baida and three poem collections between 1965 and 1966. In the latter year, he also wrote \"The Memorandum of the UNF to the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\", an open letter which condemned the 1965\u20131966 Ukrainian purge and the Russification of Ukraine, and called for the release of special settlers. This brought the group under the surveillance of the KGB. Other open letters were written to various government organs, including one to high-ranking leaders of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (First Secretary Petro Shelest, Chairman of the Council of Ministers Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Demyan Korotchenko) urging them to declare Ukraine as a sovereign entity.\nSecond arrest and psychiatric hospital stay\nKrasivskyi was re-arrested in March 1967 alongside fellow UNF leaders Dmytro Kvetsko\u00a0, Mykhailo Diak\u00a0, Yaroslav Lesiv, and Vasyl Kulynyn. They were charged with treason and involvement in a conspiratorial group and tried under the Supreme Court of the Ukrainian SSR. Krasivskyi was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment (of which seven were to be spent in corrective labour colonies) and five years of internal exile.\nKrasivskyi initially spent his sentence at Vladimir Central Prison, and continued to write poems in this time period. In 1972, he was released and placed in a psychiatric hospital in the city of Smolensk. He was moved to a Lviv psychiatric hospital in 1976. The same year, he was declared a prisoner of conscience by international human rights non-governmental organisation Amnesty International. Iris Akahoshi, an American member of Amnesty International, took particular interest in Krasivskyi's case, ",

The song was written by Jorge Luis Piolto and Rudy P\u00e9rez with the latter handling its productions. It is a ballad, in which the narrator is devastated after being betrayed by her lover. The song was inspired by the divorce of her parents. A ranchera version of the track was also recorded.\n\"C\u00f3mo Se Cura una Herida\" was nominated Pop Song of the Year at 2002 Lo Nuestro Awards and Hot Latin Track of the Year and Latin Pop Airplay of the Year at the Latin Billboard Music Awards in the same year. Commercially, it topped the Billboard Hot Latin Songs and Latin Pop Airplay charts in the United States, her second number one on both charts. An accompanying music video was directed by Pablo Croce and features Velasquez walking in a forest and a city.\nBackground and composition\nIn 1999, Jaci Velasquez released her first Spanish-language album, Llegar a Ti, which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Pop Performance The record was then followed up with Crystal Clear a year later which was nominated a Grammy Award for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album. Both albums were produced by Mark Heimermann and Rudy P\u00e9rez.  On March 16, 2001, Sony Discos announced that Velasquez was working on a new album and once again collaborates with Heimemann and P\u00e9rez along with working with Emilio Estefan, Alejandro Jaen, and Desmond Child.\nAccording to Sony Discos's website, \"C\u00f3mo Se Cura una Herida\" is a \"heartfelt\" ballad that \"embodies the devastating feeling of when your world coming crumbling down as you discover a loved one has betrayed you. It's the sad realization that this person who you believed was so strong, so stable, so righteous was, in reality, so weak, so vulnerable, so deceitful\" and the song concludes that \"there is only one true being\". According to Velasquez, the song was inspired by her parents divorce. A ranchera version of the track was also recorded for the album.\nPromotion and reception\n\"C\u00f3mo Se Cura una Herida\" was released as the album's lead single on March 27, 2001, by Sony Discos.

Richard Harrington of the Washington Post called it the album's highlight, although he felt the ranchera version \"falls flat\". At the 2002 Latin Billboard Music Awards, \"C\u00f3mo Se Cura una Herida\" was nominated in the categories of Hot Latin Track of the Year and Latin Pop Airplay of the Year, but ultimately lost both awards to \"Abr\u00e1zame Muy Fuerte\" by Juan Gabriel.

He brings her Drisker\u2019s books of magic, but they find nothing of use, until Tarsha stumbles upon a symbol that matches something she had seen on a wall at Paranor, so she decides to return to Paranor.\nMeanwhile, Drisker finds himself trapped in the Forbidding, and begins searching for Grianne. Her Ulk Bog companion Weka Dart finds him first. Grianne had sent him to find Drisker, but Weka immediately voices his fear that Drisker has come to take his mistress away. Despite this, he leads Drisker on the three-day journey to meet her. Along the way, Drisker takes ill from something he ate, and Weka leaves him to get Grianne. \nDrisker puts up a magic shield to protect himself, then slips into a fever dream where he is able to communicate with Tarsha. They are unable to speak, but he is able to communicate to her that he is trapped in the Forbidding, and she communicates that Flinc is alive. Tarsha finds that she is able to pass the Guardian and enter Paranor as Allanon anointed her a Druid at the Hadeshorn. Once inside, she has a second dream with Drisker. Drisker communicates the location of a secret room containing the Druid Histories she is seeking. She discovers two volumes written by Grianne and uses her Wishsong to reveal text on two blank pages that Grianne had hidden with magic that could only be undone by one of Grianne's bloodline. On the pages she discovers that the darkwand that freed Grianne from the Forbidding is still inside the Forbidding. She then heads to the Federation encampment where she confers with Belladrin Rish. \nLater, Drisker is rescued by Grianne, and she takes him to her home at Kraal Reach, where she heals him.

Spirit wall dwellers lead them through the walls to Vendra Trax\u2019s apartment where they search unsuccessfully for the darkwand, inadvertently triggering a trap that alerts Trax of their presence.

    "Cycle route in the United States\nU.S. Bicycle Route\u00a080 (USBR\u00a080) is an east\u2013west United States Bicycle Route that travels through North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma in the United States.\nRoute description\nCurrently, the route is only signed in Arkansas, with approximately 177 miles signed between Little Rock and West Memphis\nArkansas\nUSBR\u00a080 begins in Crittenden County at the Tennessee state line over the Mississippi River on the Harahan Bridge, also known as the Big River Crossing. It follows this along with the Mississippi River Trail (USBR\u00a045) west towards West Memphis, closely paralleling US 70/79 on a grade-separated trail. It turns onto South Loop Road and follows this roadway until turning north onto Port Road/Dabbs Avenue/Avalon Street. The route turns west onto Rainer Road and leaves West Memphis proper by turning south onto Waverly Road.\nUSBR 80 continues along this road through southern Crittenden County, turning onto Lake Rest Road and joining Arkansas Highway 147. South of Anthonyville, the route turns onto Arkansas Highway 50 and then turns southbound onto US Route 79. \nThe vast majority of USBR 80 follows US Route 79 (westwardly) through St. Francis, Lee, Monroe, Prairie, and Arkansas Counties, including the cities of Hughes, Marianna, Clarendon, and Stuttgart. \nIn Stuttgart, USBR 80 briefly turns south onto Leslie Street then turns west onto Washington Street, then north onto Burkle Street. Burkle Street very quickly becomes US Route 165, which turns west. It briefly re-enters Prairie County and then into Lonoke County. In England, Arkansas, USBR 80 continues to follow US 165 to the north for a few blocks and then turns west along Arkansas Highway 161. Both AR 161 and USBR 80 turn north near the Arkansas River around the same time they enter Pulaski County. \nNear Scott, Arkansas, AR 161 ends at US 165, but the roadway locally continues as Walkers Corner Road. USBR 80 follows this road northward and then turns west onto Faulkner Lake Road. Once entering the city limits of North Little Rock, this road changes names to Lynch Drive. USBR briefly joins US 70 (Broadway Street) and then continues straight on Washington Avenue (US 70 turns to the right away from Washington Avenue). Turning onto Riverfront Drive, USBR 80 follows this road for about a block and then joins the Arkansas River Trail on a dedicated pathway, paralleling the Arkansas River across from Little Rock. \nUSBR 80 as well as the Arkansas River Trail briefly join River Road until it ends and once again becomes a paved trail. The route continues westward along the Arkansas River towards Burns Park and eventually ends at the Big Dam Bridge. \nHistory\nThe Arkansas Department of Transportation announced in 2022 that USBR 80 had been designated throughout the aforementioned route. ARDOT has signed the route since that point and finished doing so around 2024.\n",

    "\nCatholic boys' secondary school in Curepipe, Mauritius\nSt. Joseph's College is a Catholic boys' secondary school located in Curepipe, Mauritius. It is one of the main secondary schools in Curepipe and Mauritius. Opened by the Brothers of Christian Schools in January 1877, it has been administered by the Diocese of Port-Louis since 1985. Its motto is Ad altiora cum Christo. The students are known as \"Jos\u00e9phien\".\nHistory\nCurepipe was founded in 1867 when part of the population abandoned Port Louis, the capital, to escape malaria and settled in the highlands. Curepipe developed rapidly and achieved city status in 1890.\nIn 1870, Brother Vinoch, director of St. Joseph's College in Port Louis, which was part of the Madagascar province of the congregation, planned to build a rest house and sanatorium for sick boarders from the coast in Curepipe. He acquired land in 1875 from the parish priest of St. Therese Parish, Father Comerford, just behind the church. The house of the Brothers in Grande Rivi\u00e8re was moved to Curepipe and opened as a boarding school in January 1877. The college was expanded in 1896, and a large statue of the Virgin Mary was inaugurated in 1899 thanks to contributions from the students' families.\nThe college closed temporarily in 1920-1921 due to a controversy regarding the teaching of Latin, a core subject of the institution, to the sons of families, who were mostly Franco-Mauritian descendants. Ultimately, the college obtained an exemption from Rome. A few years later, the Brothers opened the school to Creole (descendants of African and Malagasy mixed-race) and Chinese communities, as well as a few converted Indo-Mauritians, promoting harmonious coexistence of communities. Since its foundation, the college has had a sports tradition with fields and a gymnasium, and a musical tradition thanks to Brother L\u00e9onien-Marie, whose student harmony band (from 1878 to 1907) was famous throughout the island. This tradition continues today.\nIn 1927, the administrative commission of Curepipe, chaired by Mr. \u00c9mile Pitot, deemed the buildings outdated and damaged by the last tropical cyclone. With the help of a government loan of 300,000 rupees, the college was reconstructed starting in 1929 with modern facilities of the time. The doors, windows, partitions, and stairs were made of teak imported from Singapore. The new chapel was consecrated by Bishop Leen, Bishop of Mauritius, on November 17, 1933. The architect of the new college was Mr. Max Boull\u00e9, and the director of works was Mr. Joseph Tomi.\nAn annex for physics-chemistry and natural sciences laboratories was built in 1939, and a commercial section opened the same year. In November 1939, the authorities partially requisitioned the college due to World War II measures, using it as a military hospital under the Red Cross administration. Classes continued until 1942, sharing facilities with Royal College Curepipe (which was requisitioned), before the Brothers had to move to a rented house on Le Cl\u00e9zio Street.\nSt. Joseph's College returned to its premises in June 1946, after repairs necessitated by the three tropical cyclones of 1945. The director at the time (who arrived in 1913 in Mauritius and had been director since 1934), Brother Ignace, was of German nationality. Despite his deep attachment to his new country, he was arrested in 1940 but released a few hours later on the condition that he resign and remain confined to the college. He was the only German teacher allowed to teach children of an allied nation at the time, owing to his great prestige on the island. He had opened the college to coloured boys twelve years earlier. After the war, a higher level of English was required (French was taught in primary and partially in secondary), and the Brothers and teachers from France, R\u00e9union, and Mauritius had to pass higher British exams. The college became affiliated with an Irish province of the congregation. Irish Brothers brought new impetus to the college, and the last Francophone teachers left in 1948.\nThe new gymnasium was inaugurated in 1970 by Bishop Jean Marg\u00e9ot, the new Bishop of Mauritius. Laypeople increasingly took over due to the lack of vocations and the promotion of the laity. The last Irish Brother left the institution in 1986, and it has since been administered by the diocese. The first lay principal, Mr. Daniel K\u0153nig, a former student of the 1951 class, was appointed in 1985, followed by Mr. Serge Ng Tat Chung in 1992.\nToday\nIn recent years, the college has successfully embraced modern methods. Since the 1970s, the Mauritian government has contributed to supporting private Catholic and other denominational schools on the island. Since 1977, the curriculum and schooling have been supervised by a commission of the Ministry of Education. Mauritius was the first African country to offer free education to all its secondary and tertiary students. The college then opened to boys from non-Catholic families (mainly Hindu). Education is provided",
    "\nThe military history of Tonga extends from World War I to the present day, with Tonga participating in World War I, World War II, and the Afghan war, among other conflicts.\nWorld Wars\nTonga participated in World War I, as part of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force.\nThe Tonga Defence Service (TDS) came into existence at the beginning of World War II in 1939. In 1943, New Zealand helped train two Tongan contingents of two thousand personnel who fought in the Solomon Islands Campaign. In addition, New Zealand and US troops were stationed on Tongatapu, which became a staging point for shipping.\nAt the end of World War II, the TDS was disbanded, but was re-formed in 1946.\nPeacekeeping Operations\nFormer Prime Minister Prince Lavaka Ata 'Ulukalala (now King Tupou VI) joined the naval arm of the Tonga Defence Service in 1982 and became Lieutenant-Commander of the defence force in 1987. From 1990 to 1995 he commanded the PPB VOEA Pangai and his time in charge included peacekeeping operations in Bougainville.\nIn 2002, TDS soldiers were deployed as part of a multi-national regional peacekeeping force in the Solomon Islands. In July 2004, a forty-five personnel contingent of the TDS served in the Solomon Islands. A third contingent was sent in July 2005. This contingent consisted of thirty-three TDS troops, and was expected to remain four months.\nIraq War\nIn March 2003, military-to-military talks began between Tonga and the United States about Tonga providing personnel for the Multinational force in Iraq. Support arrangements were finalised in May 2004. Forty-five Royal Tongan Marines, led by the Chief of Defence of the Tonga Defence Services, Colonel Tau'aika 'Uta'atu, departed Tonga on 13 June 2004. From July 2004, the Royal Tonga Marines were augmenting the 1st Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEF) in the Al Anbar Province of Iraq. The Royal Marines supported the 1st Marine Division's security and stabilisation mission at Camp Blue Diamond. Tonga first served with the 1st MEF on the Solomon Island during World War II. The Royal Tongan Marines returned from Iraq in December 2004. In December 2008, the Tonga Defence Services ended their mission in the Iraq War and returned home.\nTongan troops training in England with the Royal Air Force Regiment in 2010.\nIn 2006, TDS soldiers, in co-operation with local police, were deployed to deal with the Nuku'alofa riots.\nAfghan War\nIn 2010, Tongan troops began training with the RAF Regiment, in preparation for operations in Afghanistan; the first troops deployed to Afghanistan during February 2011. Tonga's military size was approximately 450 troops, half of which were sent to fight in the War in Afghanistan, serving in Camp Bastion and Camp Leatherneck. During the September 2012 Camp Bastion raid Tonga troops were in perimeter guard towers without any night-vision devices. In September 2013, Tonga Defence Services were officially renamed into His Majesty's Armed Forces (HMAF). In April 2014, the Royal Tongan Marines ended their mission supporting Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.\n",
    "Municipal building in Buckfastleigh, Devon, England\nBuckfastleigh Town Hall is a municipal building in Bossell Road in Buckfastleigh, a town in Devon, in England. It currently accommodates the offices and meeting place of Buckfastleigh Town Council.\nHistory\nThe building was commissioned by the Hamlyn family as part of celebrations to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Joseph Hamlyn and his youngest son, William, were the proprietors the Town Mill, the largest of the woollen mills in Buckfastleigh at that time. Joseph also had two other sons, James and John. James Hamlyn became a director of the Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway. The site they selected for the town hall was on the south side of Bossell Road, the road that led to Bossell House, a mansion that James Hamlyn had built in 1880.\nThe new building was designed by James Hine of the firm of Hine & Odgers in Plymouth, in the neoclassical style, built in a mix of red brick and rubble masonry and was completed in 1887. The design involved a narrow main frontage of two bays facing northeast with a longer frontage of four bays stretching out behind along Bossell Road. There was a short flight of steps leading up to a segmental headed doorway with a keystone in the right-hand bay. The left-hand bay was fenestrated by a small segmental headed window on the ground floor and there was a pair of segmental headed sash windows, which were linked together, on the first floor. There was an open pediment above with the words \"Hall and Institute\" carved into the tympanum. Internally, the principal rooms were a town hall, a mechanics' institute, a library and a technical school.\nThe town hall was extended along Bossell Road by an extra five bays in 1924. The Hamlyn family put the town hall into a charity, and in 1952, Buckfastleigh Town Council became the trustees of the charity. Buckfastleigh Urban District Council, which had been based at Harewood House further to the west along Bossell Road, relocated to the town hall in the 1960s. However, this was short-lived as the town hall ceased to be the local seat of government when Teignbridge District Council was formed in 1974. Since then, the town hall has continued to serve as a library, and to provide space for community events, as well as serving as the offices and meeting place of Buckfastleigh Town Council.\nWorks of art in the town hall include portraits of three members of the Hamlyn family: Joseph (1809\u20131888) by Worthy Vizard, John (1816\u20131878) by Warwick Henry Mann, and William Junior (1852\u20131941) by an unknown artist.\n",

The patient was an 82-year-old woman and \"during the surgery, due to local anaesthesia, the patient had intolerance\". As she could only speak a local dialect and did not appear to respond to the doctor's warnings in Mandarin, the surgeon \"treated the patient roughly in an emergency situation\".

    "Archaeological site in Israel\nKfar Dvora was a Jewish settlement during the Talmudic period in the upper Gilbon River in the Golan Heights. At the site, remains of a Jewish settlement, synagogue, a Beth midrash, 5 inscriptions in Aramaic, 1 in Greek, and one in Hebrew were discovered, which was a novelty in research, as it indicated the existence of a Beth midrash in the place. Many decorated stones were also found, integrated into secondary construction and scattered in the area. On the ruins of Kfar Dvora, the Syrian village of Daburiya was established, which is currently abandoned. Before the Six-Day War, the village was inhabited by Bedouins of the Na'arna tribe, who made secondary use of the stones from the ancient Jewish settlement for construction purposes. The village is currently located northwest of the settlement of kidmat Tzvi.\nHistory\nIn the village, archaeological remains have been found indicating a thriving settlement during the Mishnaic and Talmudic periods, including remains of olive oil press facilities, which were likely the village's main economic activity and contributed to its wealth. One of the important findings in the village is a unique lintel decorated with two birds of prey holding a wreath in their beaks, with the inscription: \u201d\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5 \u05e9\u05d4\u05dc\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9  \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e7\u05e4\u05e8\u201d.The inscription refers to Eleazar ha-Kappar, a Tanna of the fifth generation, who was active in Katzrin and its surroundings. The lintel is currently located in the Golan Archaeological Museum in Katzrin. The lintel stone found embedded in one of the house walls Another lintel stone was found embedded in the walls of one of the houses. It is about a meter long and is decorated with an eagle holding a wreath in its beak and two fish beside it. It is possible that this lintel adorned the village's synagogue.\nIn October 2018, a hiding complex was documented within the boundaries of the Kfar Dvora. The complex is dated to the first century BCE, with its use continuing until the first century CE.\nGallery\n",

After almost a year of preparations, TV Cabugi was opened on September 1, 1987, being the second of three stations to go on air that year in the municipality (along with TV Ponta Negra, opened on March 15, and TV Tropical, on October 31), and the third television station in the state, in addition to being the last state in Brazil to receive a Rede Globo affiliate.\nThe station's first headquarters was a small building located in the Lagoa Nova neighborhood, where fifteen years later, its current headquarters would be built next door, with extensive facilities, fully adapted to a TV station. The first programs produced by the channel were Bom Dia RN and RNTV, the latter in 3 daily editions. It has also produced several other programs throughout its history, such as Cabugi Ver\u00e3o, Cabugi Cidade, Meio Dia RN and Valeu o Boi. However, most of the time it was limited to filling Rede Globo's mandatory local programming. In national programming, the broadcaster has always been in first place in audience ratings, but its local news programs have always suffered from the police programs shown by competitors, which often reach peaks of leadership.\nA few years after its inauguration, it began to internalize its signal with retransmitters in several municipalities, some of them shared with other channels, such as TV Universit\u00e1ria. In Mossor\u00f3, the second largest city in the state, the signal previously retransmitted from TV Verdes Mares in Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1 (relay station on VHF channel 13) was replaced by TV Cabugi's relay. The city also gained a commercial and journalism office, responsible for coverage of the inland region, which sent its material via mail (bus) for broadcast in Natal. In 1998, it opened its internet portal, Cabugi.com, becoming one of the first broadcasters in the state to maintain its content on the web. It also maintained, directly or indirectly, other parallel businesses, such as FM 102.9 (sold years later to Rede Aleluia), Cabuginet, Cabugitec and Cabugisat.\nThroughout its history, it has also been accused of favoring the political group to which it is linked in its programming, even having its signal removed from the air by decision of the Electoral Court in 2006. In August 2005, amid rumors that reported the poor financial situation of the controlling group, the station had half of its shares sold to Rede InterTV, controlled by businessman Fernando Aboudib Camargo. The broadcaster was incorporated into the network in September of the following year, becoming InterTV Cabugi. There was immediately a mass layoff, especially affecting older employees, marking the beginning of the broadcaster's restructuring, which also included the shutdown of the Cabugi.com portal and its replacement by in360.\nIn 2009, it replaced the old inland microwave links with satellite transmission. On March 27, 2015, after InterTV Costa Branca was opened in Mossor\u00f3, much of its coverage in the inland of Rio Grande do Norte was incorporated by the new station, and InterTV Cabugi was reduced to 44 municipalities in the eastern portion of the state.\nIn December 2019, InterTV Cabugi carried out layoffs. 8 cameramen and 5 film reporters were dismissed from the company's team. On July 13, 2020, the broadcaster ended production of the sports journalist Globo Esporte RN and fired its entire team, such as presenter and editor Thiago Cesar and video reporters Luiz Gustavo Ribeiro and Douglas Lemos.\nTechnical information\nThe station began its digital transmissions on March 22, 2010, on channel 34 UHF. The digital signal launch ceremony took place at the broadcaster's headquarters. On December 2, 2013, local news programs began to be shown in high definition.\nBased on the federal decree transitioning Brazilian TV stations from analog to digital signals, InterTV Cabugi, as well as the other stations in Natal, ceased broadcasting on VHF channel 11 on May 30, 2018, following the official ANATEL schedule.\n",

    "1992 promotional single by Peter Gabriel\n\"Come Talk to Me\" is the opening song from English rock musician Peter Gabriel's sixth album, Us (1992). It was written by Gabriel and recorded as a duet with Irish singer Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor. The song was released as a promotional single and also received a music video directed by Matt Mahurin. The music video also included the involvement of Michael Coulson, the creative director from Real World, and British visual artist Nichola Bruce.\nBackground\nGabriel wrote \"Come Talk to Me\" about the breakdown in communication between him and one of his daughters, who believed that her father had become distant following his divorce with Jill Gabriel. Footage of Gabriel and producer Daniel Lanois rehearsing \"Come Talk to Me\" was featured during a UK Channel 4 documentary that aired in 1993. Lanois characterised \"Come Talk to Me\" as a \"simple song with quite a huge production\" and a \"little message to one person that can be interpreted as a universal message.\"\nThe song begins with distorted guitar chords, which later gives way to African-style drums, bagpipes, and synthesisers. The African drums were taken from a Senegalese groove recorded by master drummer Doudou N'Diaye Rose. Rose and Gabriel chopped up the drum groove and supplemented them with other percussive beats. The additional vocals on the chorus were sung by Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, who Gabriel admired and had a brief romantic relationship with. On his website, Gabriel said that it was \u201ca powerful thing\u201d to have O\u2019Connor appear on the song, adding that he was pleased with her performance.\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Gabriel stated that \"Come Talk to Me\" carried more significance to him than \"Kiss That Frog\", a song from Us that he considered to be a \"throwaway\". \"But it's important for me to have both sides present \u2013 different moods, different feelings.\"\nArtwork\nThe cover art was created by Scottish sculptor David Mach, who created an image of Gabriel\u2019s screaming face. Using collage, Mach created a 1320mm x 1310mm x 120mm image of Gabriel with his mouth open and used postcards for the green background.  Mach contorted and processed Gabriel\u2019s face into a \"nightmarish, suppressed scream\" and decided that the image would be a good fit for the song, rationalising that Gabriel \"was a very good screamer\". He also said that the warped image of Gabriel was a representation of \"the distortion of language\", explaining that similar to a game of Chinese whispers, the original intent of a verbally communicated message can be misinterpreted by the person on the receiving end.\nCritical reception\nRichard Harrington of The Washington Post commented that the song \"explores barriers to communication and the need to 'unlock the misery'\", adding that \"despite its somber tone, it's a typically elastic Gabriel concoction built on fuzzy guitars, African drum loops, a Russian folk chorale, bagpipes, doudouks  and a Sinead O'Connor harmony.\" Daryll Easlea, a Peter Gabriel biographer, noted the duration of the song's fade-out, saying that it created the impression of a conversation \"continuing in a permanent loop.\" David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described the lyrics as \"vague enough to apply to romantic liaisons\", while also acknowledging that Gabriel's original intention of writing the song for one of his daughters was also applicable.\nGreg Kot of Rolling Stone thought that some of the \"artsy\" lyrics detracted from the \"otherwise beautiful 'Come Talk to Me'\". The Orlando Sentinel praised \"Come Talk to Me\" as \"an enticing song, stunningly arranged\" with \"bagpipes, driving polyrhythms, vocal harmonies by Sinead O\u2019Connor, the Dimitri Pokrovsky Ensemble and various exotic instruments  combine to make this plea for communication almost as moving as Gabriel's earlier masterpieces, Biko and San Jacinto\". Similar to Kot's commentary, the publication was also critical of some of the song's \"pretentious lines\".\nLive performances\n\"Come Talk to Me\" was the concert opener on his 1993\u201394 Secret World Tour, during which Gabriel sang the song holding a handset attached to a long cable, which pulled him back toward a telephone booth that he emerged from through a trapdoor. Depending on the leg of the tour, Gabriel was joined by Paula Cole, who was situated on a circular stage; this platform was attached to a square stage connected by a narrow runway with a conveyer belt that tugged Gabriel around as he advanced further from the telephone box toward the center stage holding the handset. A micro-camera was also attached to Gabriel's head, which projected images of Gabriel\u2019s face throughout parts of the performance.\nThe song was later performed on the 2012\u20132014 Back to Front Tour and also appeared on the Back to Front: Live in London album recorded at The O2 Arena in London.\nPersonnel\nCredits from the Us liner notes.\nPeter Gabriel \u2013 vocals, programming, keyboards, synth bass, triangle\nDavid Rhodes \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nTony Levin \u2013 bass guitar\nRichard",

    "Estonian printmaker and painter (1885\u20131957)\nGustav Mootse (July 15, 1885 \u2013 November 16, 1957) was an Estonian printmaker and painter.\nEarly life and education\nGustav Mootse was born at the Kristjan-Jaani farm in V\u00f5nnu Parish, Estonia, the son of Jaan Mootse (Mootze, 1847\u20131930) and Ann Mootse (n\u00e9e Kerge, 1848\u20131918). He learned to read at home and attended the V\u00f5nnu village school (1894\u20131897), and then he attended St George's Parish School in Tartu (1897\u20131899). He also studied at Tartu High School\u00a0 (1899\u20131903) and Hugo Treffner High School (1903\u20131904). At the recommendation of and with material support from Jaan T\u00f5nisson, Mootse traveled to Saint Petersburg to acquire an art education. He studied ink drawing and xylography at the School of Technical Drawing of Baron Alexander von Stieglitz (1904\u20131909) and then wood engraving at the studio of Vasily Mate of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences (1909\u20131912). Later he improved his skills at the Leipzig School of Graphic Design and Book Illustration (1926\u20131927). In 1928, he traveled to Italy, where he was particularly interested in ancient and Renaissance art.\nCareer\nMootse worked as a drawing teacher, technical draftsman, and book illustrator in Saint Petersburg. Under the pseudonym Foma Urvanov (\u0424\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u0423\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432), he contributed to illustrated and cartoon magazines and newspapers in Saint Petersburg. For example, he worked as a cartoonist for the weekly satirical magazine \u041f\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0447\u044a (Pugach).\nMootse fell ill with a pulmonary disease and returned to Estonia in 1918.

Starting in 1928, he worked in several schools in Viljandi, and he worked as a lecturer in teacher training courses during the summer. In the jubilee article for his 50th birthday, Gustav Mootse was called the one of the most significant or best drawing teachers in Estonia of his time. From 1947 to 1952, he worked as a research employee at the Viljandi Museum\u00a0, from which he retired in 1953.

The motifs were idyllic landscapes with farmhouses and beach views, and there are many heartfelt scenes from the life of children.\nGustav Mootse was known as a prolific and enthusiastic creator of small graphics, specifically bookplates. In total, more than 250 bookplates are known by him, the majority of which are stereotypes and woodcuts, and a smaller part of which are drypoint illustrations. When creating bookplates, Mootse used a lot of name symbols; for example, Karin Lind's bookplate with a crow (cf. Estonian lind 'crow') and a book is expressive. Sometimes name symbols and professional emblems are combined; for example, T\u00f5nis Vint's bookplate features a small songbird (cf. Estonian vint 'finch') and tailoring emblems. There are also many bookplates with images of readers. Bookplates created by Gustav Mootse were exhibited in Moscow in 1962.\nMootse's paintings, mostly watercolors, depict beautiful views of the surroundings of Karksi and Viljandi, parks, and castle ruins in Viljandi. The artist especially loved autumn nature, which is depicted with a lyrical feeling. Mootse also created several high-quality flower paintings.

The Soviet Union and Djibouti established diplomatic relations on 3 April 1978. Djibouti has an embassy in Moscow and Russia has an embassy in Djibouti City.\nRecent developments\nPrior to the invasion of Ukraine, Russia had been attempting to tighten its relationship with Djibouti, which had drawn closer to China and is a member of the Belt and Road Initiative. In 2015, Russia resumed diplomatic relations with Djibouti that had been ended in 1978, with a meeting between Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov and Djibouti Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Mahmoud Ali Yusuf. The talks concluded with a bilateral military agreement under which the Djibouti Armed Forces would be trained by Russian advisors, and equipped with Russian arms and vehicles. In 2021, Russia and Djibouti entered an agreement on cooperation in politics, trade, the economy, investment activity, education, and healthcare. On 25 January 2022, the summit \"Russia-Ethiopia-Djibouti: Prospects for Business Development\" was held between dignitaries from Russia, Ethiopia and Djibouti, and was hosted by the Coordinating Committee for Economic Cooperation with African Countries of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation to further the presence of Russian companies in the region.\nRussia's investments in Djibouti increased after Russia invaded Ukraine, and Djibouti became one of Russia's few open allies in the region. On 15 March 2023, Russia, China, and Iran held joint naval exercises in the Gulf of Oman, operating out of the Chinese naval base in Djibouti City. Russia was planning to build its own naval base in the city because Russian warships routinely use the port to resupply, and China has stated Russia is free to use the Chinese base to dock its ships, such as the Admiral Kuznetsov. The Russian paramilitary Wagner Group also maintains a presence in Djibouti, further straining relations with the United States, which maintains its own military base Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. As part of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, most of the grain being exported by Ukraine in agreement with Russia was sent to Djibouti to be distributed to the rest of the Horn of Africa under Russia's supervision.\n",

NGC 4017 was discovered by German-British astronomer William Herschel in 1785.\nIt is difficult to see a bar in the center of NGC 4017 in the image obtained from the SDSS survey data. The intermediate spiral classification from the NASA/IPAC database seems to fit this galaxy better.\nThe luminosity class of NGC 4017 is II-III and it has a broad HI line.\nTo date, four non-redshift measurements yield a distance of 73.850 \u00b1 14.580 Mpc (\u223c241 million ly), which is just outside the Hubble distance values. Note, however, that it is with the average value of independent measurements, when they exist, that the NASA/IPAC database calculates the diameter of a galaxy and that consequently the diameter of NGC 4017 could be approximately 29.3 kpc (\u223c95,600 ly) if we used the Hubble distance to calculate it.\nSupernovae\nTwo supernovae have been discovered in NGC 4017: SN 2006st and SN 2007an.\nSN 2006st\nThis supernova was discovered on May 30, 2006 by D. Winslow and W. Li as part of the LOSS (Lick Observatory Supernova Search) program at the Lick Observatory. This supernova was type II.\nSN 2007an\nThis supernova was discovered on March 10, 2007, by Marco Migliardi in an image taken at the Drusci observatory in the Italian town of Cortina d'Ampezzo. This supernova was type II.\nNGC 4017 Group\nAccording to A.M. Garcia, the galaxy NGC 4017 is part of a group of galaxies that bears his name. The NGC 4017 group has four members. The other members of the group are NGC 4004, NGC 4008 and NGC 4016.\nAbraham Mahtessian also mentions a group of which NGC 4008 is a part, but there are only three galaxies in his list, NGC 4017 not appearing there.\nOn the other hand, it is surprising that the galaxy IC 2982 to the west of NGC 4004 does not appear in either list. The distance separating it from the Milky Way is 53.86 \u00b1 3.78 Mpc (\u223c176 million ly), practically the same as that of NGC 4004.\nThis galaxy is even designated as NGC 4004B by the database NASA/IPAC We could even say that the two galaxies form an interacting pair given the deformation of NGC 4004. This is undoubtedly why the two galaxies are included in the catalog of Vorontsov-Velyaminov interacting galaxies.\nThe galaxies NGC 4016 and NGC 4017 are almost the same distance from the Milky Way and are neighbors in the celestial sphere. The image obtained from the SDSS study data shows a certain deformation in the galaxy NGC 4016.\nThese two galaxies are surely in gravitational interaction and they also appear in the catalog of Vorontsov-Velyaminov interacting galaxies. They also appear in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the designation Arp 305. Halton Arp notes that one of the arms of NGC 4016 has a broken segment.\nSee also\nList of spiral galaxies\nList of NGC objects (4001\u20135000)\nExternal links\nNGC 4017 at NASA/IPAC\nNGC 4017 at SIMBAD\nNGC 4017 at LEDA\n",
    "\nProfessional institution school in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso\nThe National School of Administration and Judiciary (ENAM), created on December 4, 1959, is a higher education institution for training administrative personnel in Burkina Faso, headquartered in Ouagadougou.\nHistory\nCreation and context\nFormerly called the National School of Administration (ENA), the current National School of Administration and Judiciary (ENAM) was established by presidential decree on December 4, 1959, at the dawn of the independence of Upper Volta, which became Burkina Faso in August 1984. The opening of this training school for administrative agents marked the political will of the country's authorities to establish a specialized school to support the efforts of setting up the new national administration. From January 1960, the ENA began to operate and received its first trainees for six months of training to replace colonial personnel. At that time, the school focused on urgent needs with personnel from fields such as general administration, rural economy and cooperation, justice, and police, financial legislation, and accounting.\nEvolution\nFrom October 1966, its general mission became the training and improvement of various personnel at all levels and applied research for development. It also acquired the status of a public administrative institution (EPA) with legal personality and financial autonomy.\nSince 1968, the school has occupied its current premises in Ouagadougou next to the Joseph Ki-Zerbo University. Depending on institutional changes, administrative supervision has been exercised by the presidency, the Prime Minister, and finally the Ministry of Public Service. These successive changes in the supervisory institution aimed to allow close monitoring of its activities.\nName change\nIn 1984, the school opened a section for auditors of justice and adopted its current name, the National School of Administration and Judiciary (ENAM). ENAM is under the technical supervision of the Ministry of Public Service and the financial supervision of the Ministry of Finance.\nSince its creation in 1959, the National School of Administration and Judiciary (ENAM) has always positioned itself as a leading institution in the professional training of state personnel. Indeed, the various reforms the institution has undergone have always advocated for the consolidation of its primary role in training state agents and later local government personnel, as well as the diversification of its missions. ENAM's institutional evolution has been marked by the modernization efforts initiated in the 2000s (2011-2020 Strategic Decade Plan for the Modernization of Administration), materialized in 2011 with the adoption of the first strategic plan of TENAM (2011\u20132016). Following this first plan, a second was adopted in 2017 (2017\u20132021). These two strategic plans significantly changed ENAM's trajectory, expanding its actions in the field of vocational training.\nMain missions\nCurrently, ENAM's missions are threefold:\nThe initial and continuing vocational training of state agents, local governments, public and semi-public institutions;\nConducting applied research in public administration;\nProviding advisory assistance to state administrations, local governments, public and semi-public institutions.\nThese contemporary missions of ENAM stem from the strategic planning of 2011-2016 and 2017\u20132021. These two important moments in the structure's development have seen varied results with many achievements but also many shortcomings. However, ENAM has long been the flagship of professional education in Burkina Faso.\nTraining programs by department\nGeneral Administration\nGeneral Administration\nSecretariat\nHuman Resource Management\nArchives\nInformation and Documentation Management\nSocio-Economic Services Management\nSchool and University Administration\nSchool and University Intendance\nEconomics and Finance\nSchool and University Administration\nJudiciary and Registry\nJudiciary\nRegistries and Prosecutor's Office\nHuman Rights\nJudicial Interpreters\nEmployment, Vocational Training, and Social Law Management\nEmployment and Vocational Training\nLabor Administration and Social Laws\nTourism and Cultural Services Management\nCultural Administration\nTourism\nCinema and Audiovisual\nMuseology\nDirectors\n1959-1973: Lompolo Kon\u00e9\n1965-1967: Malick Zorom\u00e9\n1973-1980: Ignace Kalmogo\n1980-1982: Laurent Kilachiu Bado\n1982-1983: Ambroise Zagre\n1984-1986: Pascal T\u00e9mai Benon\n1983-1984: Laurent Kilachiu Bado\n1986-1987: Jonas Hanitan Ye\n1988-1994: Philippe Som\u00e9\n1994-2001: Haridata Dakour\u00e9\n2001-2012: Moctar Tall\n2013-2018: Beno\u00eet Kambou\n2018-2023: Awalou Ouedraogo\n2023\u2013present: Jacob Yarassoula Yarabatioula\nNotable alumni\nRoch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9, President of Burkina Faso (2015\u20132022)\nS\u00e9glaro Abel Som\u00e9, Minister of Civil Service, Labor, and Social Protection\nAlain Thierry Ouattara, Minister of Sports and Leisure\n",

    "Fortnite tournament at the 2024 Esports World Cup\nFortnite is scheduled to have a tournament at the 2024 Esports World Cup, held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between August 8 and 11, 2024. Sixteen teams will take part in this tournament, six having qualified from a LAN tournament at DreamHack Dallas and ten qualifying from online qualifiers. Due to the tournament not being sponsored or sanctioned by Epic Games, the game's developer, the tournament is known as Esports World Cup: Featuring Fortnite.\nThis tournament will utilize ESL Featuring Fortnite, a separate game made using Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) which operates like a team shooter in a manner similar to Call of Duty or Halo as opposed to Fortnite Battle Royale, which is used for the game's official esports circuit, the Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS).\nBackground\nFortnite was officially announced as one of the games at the 2024 Esports World Cup on March 11, 2024. Epic Games, the game's developer, opted not to associate itself with the game's tournament, as they sanction the Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS), which is officially run by Blast ApS. As such, the tournament was to be known as Esports World Cup: Featuring Fortnite.\nOn April 11, 2024, ESL, which supervises the Esports World Cup tournament series and by extension the Esports World Cup: Featuring Fortnite tournament, announced ESL Featuring Fortnite, a separate game developed by 404 Creative using Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), an editor used to make custom games using the Fortnite engine. ESL Featuring Fortnite operates as a 4-on-4 team shooter, not unlike Call of Duty or Halo, and features familiar team shooter modes like Capture the Flag and Hardpoint. This contrasts to the FNCS, which is played on the Fortnite Battle Royale video game and utilizes two-player teams, known as Duos, who are often are paired from different organizations. On the same day, ESL announced that esports organizations Dignitas, Team Heretics, Karmine Corp and ZETA DIVISION had committed to fielding teams to compete in ESL Featuring Fortnite tournaments, which would also include qualifiers for Esports World Cup: Featuring Fortnite and the tournament itself, with a then-unnamed Brazilian organization later revealed to be LOUD. Additional teams that would participate in ESL Featuring Fortnite tournaments were announced in May 2024.\nFortnite was one of the games at the Gamers8 festival, which was the predecessor to the Esports World Cup, for both 2022 and 2023. The Gamers8 tournaments for both years used Fortnite Battle Royale Duos like the FNCS, albeit with 88-player (or 44-Duo) fields.\nFormat\nThe format for this tournament is yet to be known. It is, however, likely that the tournament will use a combination of a GSL-style group stage and a double elimination bracket like what was seen during the qualifying tournament at DreamHack Dallas.\nThe top 8 teams at the tournament will gain Esports World Cup Club Championship points. Each organization will be able to qualify for the Club Championship itself if they place in the top 8 in another EWC event, with the winning team's organization able to win the Club Championship as well if they also place in the top 8 of another event.\nQualified teams\nSixteen teams will qualify for the Esports World Cup: Featuring Fortnite tournament: 6 teams qualified via an offline LAN tournament held at DreamHack Dallas in the United States, while 10 additional teams will qualify via online qualifiers held on the FACEIT platform.\nDreamHack Dallas qualifiers\nAgent Gaming\nBerlin International Gaming (BIG)\nFnatic\nHeroic\nKarmine Corp\nTeam Falcons\nOnline qualifiers\nEurope\nTBD\nTBD\nNorth America\nTBD\nTBD\nLatin America\nTBD\nTBD\nMiddle East and Africa\nTBD\nTBD\nAsia-Pacific\nTBD\nOceania\nTBD\nNotes\n",
    "Bath UK vehicle charging zone\nBath Clean Air Zone is an area of central Bath, England where traffic is restricted to reduce air pollution. It became the second Clean Air Zone in the UK (after London) when it was introduced in March 2021. It has been credited with helping to reduce nitrogen dioxide pollution in the city by around a quarter since 2019, and has raised over \u00a37 million in fines. However, critics of the scheme argue that it has displaced traffic to other parts of the city and nearby towns.\nImplementation\nThe Bath Clean Air Zone covers the historic centre of Bath, extending to parts of Walcot, Bathwick, Widcombe, Beechen Cliff, Kingsmead, and the whole of the Royal Victoria Park and Botanic Gardens. It is enforced 24 hours a day, every day of the year, by automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) cameras installed on roads approaching the zone. Unlike zones in London and Birmingham, which charge almost all drivers of non-exempt vehicles, Bath's is designated as a Class-C Clean Air Zone according to European emission standards: only higher-emission (pre-Euro 6 diesel and pre-Euro 4 petrol) taxis, vans, buses, minibuses, and other commercial vehicles pay to enter the zone, while private cars and motorcycles are exempt, even if they are older, higher-emission vehicles. Electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles are also exempt. Charges range from \u00a39 to \u00a3100 per day.\nRoad signs like this one outside Bath Spa railway station encourage waiting motorists to avoid idling inside the Clean Air Zone.\nHistory\nBath is a World Heritage Site, with many tall, historic tenement buildings ranged along narrow streets. Although much of the central shopping district is pedestrianized, traffic pollution has long been an issue. Citing high levels of nitrogen dioxide, a March 2017 report for the BBC Inside Out West TV news programme claimed \"At times Bath's air quality is as bad as Beijing\".\nLater in 2017, then UK government environment minister Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey directed Bath and North East Somerset Council to produce a clean air plan that would improve Bath's air quality in the shortest possible time; the council announced its plans for a clean air zone in October 2018. According to Robin Kerr of the Federation of Bath Residents' Associations (FOBRA), writing in the Bath Chronicle, the council had been \"handed a golden opportunity finally to tackle Bath's transport problems...  air pollution... which blights the World Heritage site\". Other local people expressed concerns that the scheme would lead to deserted streets with harmful effects on the tourist trade.\nFollowing a six-week public consultation, the council decided it was fairest to implement a scheme that would primarily target large, highly-polluting vehicles (such as commercial vehicles and buses) and exempt all ordinary, private motorists from the charge. The council also announced \u00a39.4 million of financial support, which had by 2023 helped over 1,500 people to replace 938 polluting vehicles. Taxi and van drivers can apply for grants of up to \u00a34,500, while bus, coach, and HGV operators are eligible for up to \u00a335,000 of financial support.\nA Clean Air Zone compliant bus serving Bath University\nOriginally scheduled to launch in November 2020, the Bath Clean Air Zone was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and became the first Clean Air Zone outside London when it was finally launched on 15 March 2021.\nImpact\nIn 2021, Bath and North East Somerset Council announced that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured at 121 sites in the city (both inside and outside the clean air zone) had fallen by an average of 22 percent. In 2023, Bath's Clean Air Zone became the first in the UK to pass a \"State 3 assessment\" by the UK government's Joint Air Quality Unit, a technical milestone that means nitrogen dioxide levels have fallen to and remained inside guideline levels. There was some uncertainty over how much of this was attributable to COVID-19 restrictions and the closure of the city's historic Cleveland Bridge for maintenance. Some parts of the city, including its most polluted street, Chapel Row, experienced a significant increase in NO2 in the months after the scheme opened. In 2022, the Council reported an average 26 percent reduction in NO2 compared with 2019, noting that the number of polluting vehicles entering the zone had fallen by 71 percent between the scheme's inception in March 2021 and December 2022.\nSome 30,000\u201340,000 vehicles enter the Clean Air Zone each day, of which fewer than 5 percent are non-compliant; following the introduction of the scheme, some 28,000 motorists were fined in the first 100 days. Efforts to collect fines from drivers were initially mixed; after the first three months, the council revealed that only two-thirds of those fined were paying promptly, within seven days. Between March 2021 and December 2023, over 174,000 fines were issued to drivers who entered the zone in non-exempt vehicles, raising a total of \u00a37,102,980. According to the council, this ",
    "2023 novel by Rupert Holmes\nMurder Your Employer: The McMasters Guide to Homicide is a mystery novel by Rupert Holmes, published in 2023. Murder Your Employer was No. 6 on the New York Times bestseller list, No. 6 in new releases on the international bestsellers list in Canada, No. 9 on Publishers Weekly bestsellers list, and No. 7 on USA Today bestseller list. The audiobook version of Murder Your Employer was a finalist in 2024 for the Audie Award for Mystery.\nMurder Your Employer is the first volume of a series; Holmes estimates that the second volume, Murder Your Mate, will be available in late 2024.\nSummary\nMcMasters Conservatory for the Applied Arts is a secretive school in an undisclosed location where individuals learn how to commit murder (or deletions, the term preferred by the school). Set in the 1950s and narrated by the dean of McMasters, Harbinger Harrow, Murder Your Employer follows the education of three students.\nCliff Iverson, an aircraft design engineer, is determined to murder his supervisor who had driven two of his co-workers to suicide and added critical design flaws to Iverson's aircraft design to save on costs. Gemma Lindley is being blackmailed by her supervisor who suspects Gemma of killing her dying father to alleviate his suffering. Dulcie Mown, a well-known Hollywood actress, is tormented by a predatory studio head.\nAfter the three students complete their course of studies, they leave McMasters to finish their \"thesis\" (the murders). They will not all succeed.\nReception\nReviewers note how Holmes incorporates dry humor in Murder Your Employer. Syndicated critic Oline Cogdill calls the novel droll and irreverent. In the Los Angeles Times, Bethanne Patrick describes it as \"a funny, fast-paced, flip-the-playbook mystery\". Mark Sanderson writes in the Sunday Times, \"Although this beautifully designed DIY manual is full of twists, the emphasis is on comedy.\" Syndicated critic Peter D. Kramer interviewed Holmes about his process in creating the world of McMasters, and compares the school to \"a sort of Hogwarts for homicidalists\".\n",
    "\nDuring Muammar Gaddafi's rule over Libya, many crimes against humanity were committed by government forces against the Libyan population. Some of these include extrajudicial killings, public executions, and the torture of civilians. These violations are what caused the Libyan population to revolt against the regime.\nStudent protests\nOn April 7, 1976, university students all over Libya protested against human rights violations and authoritarian military control over all aspects of civilian lives. These protesters called for free and fair elections to take place and a more democratic system to be implemented in Libya. These protests were then violently suppressed by government forces through shootings and beatings, with many of the students being captured and detained. Universities and secondary schools were then all raided by Gaddafi in order to \"silence and eliminate\" the protesters.\nThe detained students were kept in prisons until April 7, 1977, the anniversary of the event, which Gaddafi called \"The Day of Judgement\". On this day, the students were publicly executed by hanging in Benghazi with thousands of people watching the event live on television and in real life. April 7 then became an anniversary that was celebrated by publicly executing civilians as well as defected government officials. This lasted until the late 80s-early 90s.\nWar with Chad\nGaddafi's war with Chad did not only have a negative impact on Chad, it had a detrimental impact to the Libyan economy and the army. In the Toyota War alone, Libya had lost over US$1.5 Billion and an unbelievable amount of military equipment. This war was widely condemned by the Libyan population as they felt they had no right to invade another country that didn't belong to them.\nDuring this war, thousands of Libyan underage high school students were kidnapped from schools (in Benghazi, Tripoli, and the South) by the government without the consent or knowledge of their parents. After these boys were forcefully taken out of their schools, they were loaded onto busses and sent to Chad. Some of them were killed in battle, and some were deserted in Chad by the Libyan army. Thousands of families were left confused and unaware as to what happened to their sons, with most never hearing from them ever again.\nExecutions\nThe Gaddafi regime was notorious for its common use of public executions as a sentence for Libyans who either spoke out against the regime, or lived abroad and were victims of Gaddafis \"physical liquidation\" against Libyan diasporas. These would come in the form of public hangings as well as gunfire. Some of the most notable victims of these executions were:\nOmar A. Dabboub, 7 April 1977, Benghazi. A teacher who was executed by public hanging, for participating in the '76 student demonstrations.\nMohammed bin Saud, 7  April 1977, Benghazi. A teacher who was executed by publicly hanging alongside Omar Dabboub, for participating in the '76 student demonstrations.\nMahmoud A. Nafi', 21 April 1980, London. An attorney and a business man who was assassinated in his office in London.\nMahmoud Banoun, April 1980, Tripoli. An engineer who was arrested in early April, died a few days later as a result of torture. His body delivered to family in sealed box.\nAbdul Jalil al-'Arif, April 1980, Rome. A successful business man who was a victim of Gaddafi's campaign of \"physical liquidation\" of opponents abroad.\nNaji bu Hawiya Khlyif, April 1982.

From 2005 to 2007, he was the Charter Member of the Users' Executive Committee (UEC) of the US Department of Energy's Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to create the users association, becoming the first elected chair of the user group in 2008.\nYap held the position of Faculty Fellow in the MTU Office of the Vice President for Research from 2014 to 2016, and served as the Associate Department Chair of Physics in 2023.\nResearch\nYap pioneered research on all-solid-state UV lasers based on cesium lithium borate (CsLiB6O10) nonlinear optical crystals. He initiated studies on boron-carbon nitride (B-C-N) materials and high-purity boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) using the all-solid-state UV laser. He developed novel chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods for B-C-N related nanostructures. Later, his focus shifted to the unique applications of high-purity BNNTs for future electronics and biomedical applications.\nFunctionalized high-purity BNNTs for future electronics and biomedicine\nYap and his collaborators have conducted studies on the unique properties of electrically insulating and optically transparent boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), with a band gap of approximately 6 eV. Utilizing high-purity BNNTs' electrical insulating properties, he and his colleagues developed a method to prevent dye molecule quenching on BNNTs, resulting in each BNNT serving as a fluorophore with enhanced brightness by up to 1000 times, enabling the conversion of existing dye molecules into high-brightness fluorophores (HBFs) suitable for antigen detection, leveraging BNNTs' transparency across UV to near-IR wavelengths.\nIn joint research, Yap led the creation of high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) by filling tellurium (Te) arrays of atoms inside electrically insulating BNNT. This contrasts the unstable semiconducting properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SW-CNTs) and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to structural changes and ambient conditions. He also demonstrated the creation of novel nanoscale semiconductors through a bottom-up approach, utilizing gold quantum dots coated on the surfaces of BNNTs, providing tunable band gaps capable of absorbing visible light. Additionally, he introduced a transistor fabrication method devoid of semiconductors, using quantum tunneling between gold quantum dots coated on BNNTs (QD-BNNTs) as the switching mechanism for single-electron transistors (SETs), offering improved current switching capabilities, particularly at shorter transport lengths, thus bypassing inherent limitations of traditional semiconductor-based transistors.\nHigh-purity BNNTs\nYap's work on high-purity BNNTs centers on exploring different synthesis methods for various applications. He pioneered the synthesis of high-purity BNNTs by pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). His group at MTU demonstrated the growth of BNNTs at 600oC by using an all-solid-state UV laser, and also invented a low-temperature CVD method that enables the growth of BNNTs at 1100-1200oC, similar to the synthesis of carbon nanotubes using regular furnaces in research laboratories.\nB-C-N materials\nYap has investigated B-C-N materials through novel techniques. By using an all-solid-state UV laser, he created a radio-frequency (RF) plasma-assisted PLD system. He has demonstrated a series of original discoveries on carbon nitride (CNx), cubic phase boron nitride (BN) and boron carbon nitride (BxCyNz) materials, including the conversion of CNx bonds from sp2 to sp3 hybridization ",
    "Statue of Ansbald in the Basilica of the Transfiguration of Our Lord, Pr\u00fcm\nAnsbald or Ansbold (died 12 July 886) was the abbot of Pr\u00fcm from 860 until his death.\nAnsbald was a friend and correspondent of Lupus of Ferri\u00e8res. In a letter addressed to Abbot Markward of Pr\u00fcm\u00a0 between 840 and 844, Lupus sends greetings to Ansbald, then just a monk at Pr\u00fcm. With Lupus, he worked on collating the writings of Cicero. In a letter from September 847, Lupus thanks Ansbald for sending him copies of some of Cicero's letters and asks for a copy of Cicero's In Arato.\nAnsbald was elected to succeed Eigil as abbot in 860. Lupus addressed two letters to him on 28/29 February 862 and 7 March 862. In 861, King Lothair II granted him the right to a market and mint exempt from taxation at Romarivilla. After 870, he was an important supporter of King Louis the German in Lotharingia. On 12 April 870, Louis restored to Pr\u00fcm lands near Bingen that had been seized by the rebellious count Werner. In February 871, confirmed further lands to the abbey.\nIn 882, Pr\u00fcm was sacked by Vikings. Ansbald rebuilt it with aid from Emperor Charles the Fat. He died on 12 July 886 and was venerated as a saint.\nNotes\n^ a b c d Walsh 2007, p.\u00a048.\n^ Regenos 1966, p.\u00a050.

The memoir chronicles Boyer's experience as a breast cancer patient. Boyer takes an untraditional approach to the standard illness narrative, by weaving together her personal journey as a patient in treatment with reflections on art and literature, and critiques of capitalism and the medical industry.\nIt won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, and was a finalist for the PEN America's Jean Stein Book Award. The Pulitzer committee described the book as \"an elegant and unforgettable narrative about the brutality of illness and the capitalism of cancer care in America.\"\nSynopsis\nAnne Boyer in 2023\nAt the age of 41, Anne Boyer is diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. She is a teacher and a single mother raising a daughter.\nBoyer reflects on the flaws in the American healthcare system. Despite undergoing intensive chemotherapy with medications like cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, Boyer must consistently work. Ten days after her double mastectomy she gives a university lecture on Walt Whitman's The Sleepers with surgical drainage bags stitched to her compression dressings.\nReception\nReviews\nNumerous reviews have described The Undying as an unflinching look at cancer treatment. The New York Times' nonfiction critic, Jennifer Szalai, called Boyer's memoir \"extraordinary and furious.\"  In a review for The New York Review of Books, Nellie Hermann writes about how Boyer's memoir can not be easily categorised as a standard illness narrative.\nNPR's Sascha Cohen writes, \"The Undying catalogs the unceasing losses that accompany a breast cancer diagnosis in the 21st century.\" Cohen calls the memoir an \"anti-capitalist indictment, as biting cultural criticism, as vengeance.\"\nParallels between works mentioned by Boyer, such as, Audre Lorde\u2019s The Cancer Journals, Kathy Acker\u2019s \u201cThe Gift of Disease,\u201d and Susan Sontag\u2019s Illness as Metaphor are often evoked in reviews. Anna Picard writes for The Times Literary Supplement, that Boyer's memoir joins, \"the slender library of literary, as opposed to journalistic, responses to breast cancer and breast cancer treatment.\"\n\"The Undying is not an individual tale of redemption, nor an atomised story of suffering,\" writes Elisa Adami for Art Monthly. \"Countering the lonesome desolation of illness that oncological praxis and society's own entrenched custom of segregation work to produce, Boyer strives to address and call into being a collectivity of the sick. In the revelatory light of 'pain's leaking democracy', the book attests to the vital need for collective and social remedies for healing not just our sick bodies but the sick world we inhabit too.\"\nAwards and honours\n2020: Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, winner\n2020: PEN/Jean Stein Book Award, finalist\nEditions\nAnne Boyer (17 September 2019).

    "1340 siege in Denmark\nThe Siege of Skanderborg (Danish: Belejringen af Skanderborg), alternatively the Siege of Skanderborg Castle (Skanderborg Slot), was a siege of the Holsteinian-held Skanderborg Castle in Jutland by Jutish rebels led by Niels Ebbesen. Despite being close to surrendering, the Holsteinian garrison received a relief force led by Henry II of Holstein-Rendsburg and defeated the Danes in the Battle of Nonnebjerg on 2 November 1340. \nBackground\nFurther information: Battle of Lunden\u00e6s\nIn the early 14th century, Denmark was effectively subjugated to foreign powers, with Count Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg exercising dominion over a significant portion of the country by the 1330s. However, a group of 50 Jutes, led by minor nobleman Niels Ebbesen, who were furious with the current regime, took matters into their own hands in 1340. They ambushed and assassinated Count Gerhard in Randers, a move that sent shockwaves throughout the country. In the aftermath, Ebbesen and his followers escaped through a bridge, fleeing south across the Guden\u00e5 to the Skjern River.\nAt Skjern River, Ebbesen and his men stormed a Holsteinian fort construction possibly near present-day Skjern, and killed a great number of Germans. After this, Ebbesen continued his revolt, seeking the important castle of Skanderborg.\nSiege\nIn late 1340, Ebbesen had reached Skanderborg with a force of 2000 men, and he now began initiating a siege of the Castle. The commander of the castle, Markcard Rastorf, held strongly out. The siege dragged on for a long time, and the besieged Holsteinian crew looked to be surrendering the castle soon because of a lack of food. However, with the intent to free the castle from German rule, Ebbesen would now be surprised: the surrounded garrison had meanwhile sent a message of help to the dead Count's son, Henry II, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg. Henry (nickname Iron Henry) would in subsequently send a professional force of 600 cavalry to Skander, in order to relieve the besieged. When the relief force arrived, Ebbesen quickly retreated from the siege on 2 November and went out on open terrain with the Holsteinian army pursuing.\nAftermath\nMain article: Battle of Nonnebjerg\nThe opposing forces met at a hill outside Skanderborg and engaged in an open battle. The battle was stubborn, however, the Danes would be defeated, and Ebbesen and his brothers, together with 2200 Danes, were killed in the battle. Despite the defeat, the unification of Denmark, and the fight against the Holsteinian foreigners would continue under Valdemar IV of Denmark.\nSee also\nBattle of Lunden\u00e6s\u00a0\u2013 1340 battle in Denmark\nSiege of Kolding (1368\u20131369)\u00a0\u2013 Siege in Denmark, 1369\nSiege of Vordingborg\u00a0\u2013 Siege between the Hanseatic League and Denmark between 1368\u20131370\nSiege of Copenhagen (1368)\u00a0\u2013 Siege and looting of Copenhagen by Hanseatic forces in 1368\n",

    "Musical artist\nS\u00edlvio Ant\u00f4nio Narciso de Figueiredo Caldas (23 May 1908 \u2013 3 February 1998) was a Brazilian singer and composer.\nEarly life\nCaldas was born on 23 May 1908 in the S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. His father, Antonio Narciso Caldas, was the owner of a musical instrument store, who tuned instruments and worked on pianos and was also a composer. His mother, Alcina Figueiredo Caldas, was a singer of romantic music. He had a brother, Murilo, who also was a notable musician. Starting at 5 years old, S\u00edlvio began to actively participate in Rio's Carnaval, becoming a member of the Fam\u00edlia Ideal Bloco. At 6 years old, he had his first performance at Teatro F\u00eanix.\nAt the same time, he attended Escola Coronel Cabrita, where he was expelled for fighting with students and professors. He later went to Escola Nilo Pe\u00e7anha, where he continued to fight with his peers. At 9 years old, he began to work as a mechanics apprentice at Garagem Esperan\u00e7a, on the same street as his house. In 1924, at 16, he moved to S\u00e3o Paulo for work, where he briefly stayed. From there, he moved to Catanduva, where he worked various odd jobs. In 1927, he returned to Rio de Janeiro.\nMusical career\nAfter returning to Rio, he performed a serenade during which Antonio Gomes, artistic  director of R\u00e1dio Ipanema, was present. He took Caldas to R\u00e1dio Mayrink Veiga, where he sang for free for some time, starting his musical career.\nFirst albums and radio works\nIn 1929, Caldas went to R\u00e1dio Sociedade and performed for 20 mil-r\u00e9is per night, becoming a part of a line-up that also included Gast\u00e3o Formenti, Francisco Alves, Patr\u00edcio Teixeira, and Rog\u00e9rio Guimar\u00e3es. At the same time, he still worked as a mechanic, dealing specifically with semis at the time of the opening of the current Via Dutra.\nCaldas recorded some albums with the German production company Brunswick, which initially went to Brazil to open factories for snooker accessories. Overall, no other artist from the label (which included names such as Gast\u00e3o, Carmen Miranda, and Bando da Lua) moved away from the brand and closed its doors in 1931.\nIn 1931, he was invited to the cast of O Brasil do Amor magazine (by Ary Barroso and Marques Porto) at the Teatro Recreio. During this performance, Caldas sang \"Gente Bamba\" and \"Malandragem\", both written by Ary. That same year, he recorded \"Gente Bamba\" through RCA Victor under the title \"Faceira\" \u2013 the song had been offered beforehand toM\u00e1rio Reis, but declined the offer. He had already recorded \"Tracu\u00e1 de Ferr\u00f4\", by S\u00e1tiro de Melo, but only achieved success with the Barroso composition.\nA month after 'O Brasil do Amor, Caldas participated again in another show, \u00c9 do Balacobaco, another creation of Barroso and Marques, cowritten by Vitor Pujol. This time, he sang \"Malandro\" by Freire J\u00fanior and Francisco Alves. Through partnerships he made in theatre, he went to Buenos Aires, in Argentina, starting his international career. Even still, between 1930 and 1931, he recorded a total of 35 records with two songs each.\nIn 1932, he recorded \"Maria\", composrer by Barroso and with lyrics by Luiz Peixoto. In 1933, the record \"Eu Vou para o Maranh\u00e3o\" was released, along with \"Chorei\" by Andr\u00e9 Filho,  \"Mimi\" by Uriel Lourival, and the self-composed \"Na Aldeia\", in partnership with Carusinho e De Chocolat. That same year, he launched the marcha de carnaval \"Segura Esta Mulher\", also by Barroso.\nBetting on self compositions and film\nCaldas began to consolidate himself as a composer in 1933, releasing \"Eu Vivo Sem Destino\" (cowritten with Wilson Batista and Osvaldo Santiago) and \u201cNa Floresta\" (cowritten with Cartola). In 1934, he began a largely successful partnership with the poet, journalist, and chronicler Orestes Barbosa, which brought 14 compositions, including \"Solu\u00e7os\" (recorded in 1934 by Floriano Belham), \"Serenata\" (recorded by Caldas 1935), \"Vidro Vazio\" (composed in 1936 and recorded by J. P. de Barros), and \"Santa dos Meus Amores\" (composed in 1936 and recorded by Caldas). Their best year came in 1937, when they composed 8 songs, among them \"Quase Que Eu Disse\", \"Arranha-C\u00e9u\", and their biggest hit \"Ch\u00e3o de Estrelas\". Their last two compositions were released in 1938: \"\u00danica Rima\" and \"Suburbana\".\nCaldas began to act in cinema in 1935, acting in Favela dos Meus Amores, directed by Humberto Mauro. During the film, he sang \"Ao Luar...\" (Barroso), \"Quando um Sambista Morre\", \"Favela\" (Cust\u00f3dio Mesquita and Orestes), \"Tolinha\" (Cust\u00f3dio), \"Arrependimento\" (himself and Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o de Alencar), \"Quase Que Eu Disse\" (Orestes and S\u00edlvio), and \"Torturante Ironia\".\nMove to S\u00e3o Paulo and the decline of the Radio Era\nIn 1957.\nIn 1950, he moved to S\u00e3o Paulo (specifically to the Vila Madalena neighborhood), where he signed an exclusive contract with R\u00e1dio Excelsior. In 1954, he was hired by the recently arrived Columbia Records. In 1956, he presented the \"Os Degraus da Gl\u00f3ria\" program on R\u00e1dio Gazeta and later became part of his own weekly progra",

    "Slovak journalist (born 1983)\nMichal Kova\u010di\u010d (born\u00a01983) is a Slovak journalist and talk show host.\nEarly life\nBorn in Bratislava, Kova\u010di\u010d studied law at the Comenius University graduating in 2009. He started as a production assistant before becoming a presenter of the Mark\u00edza morning news, later promoted to main news presenter. Between 2007 and 2008, Kova\u010di\u010d was a news presenter on Fun R\u00e1dio.\nCareer\nKova\u010di\u010d joined the main news team at the private Mark\u00edza television station in 2008, but took a short break from broadcasting in 2010 to undertake an internship in the United States on CNN. In 2018, he started hosting the political talk show Na Telo on Mark\u00edza, which quickly established itself as the most influential political talk show in Slovakia. In 2022, Kova\u010di\u010d finished eighth place as one of the contestants in Let's Dance.\nFollowing the 2023 Slovak parliamentary election, the government of Slovakia was reported to pressure Mark\u00edza to align its narratives with government's point of view through threating of redirecting advertisement funds from governmental institutions and public-owned firms to other broadcasters. Kova\u010di\u010d emerged amongst the leaders of Mark\u00edza journalist, who saw these developments as a censorship attempt. Wanting to resist these pressures, the journalists started to unite with Kova\u010di\u010d as the head of the new trade union organization.\nWhen the government of Slovakia started to boycott Na Telo in April 2024, Kova\u010di\u010d broadcast a short unauthorized speech at the end of Na Telo, accusing the Mark\u00edza management for being complicit in the government's agenda of censoring the political content in the media, mirroring the approach of Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary. Following the broadcast, Kova\u010di\u010d was taken off-screen. Over a hundred of Mark\u00edza journalists wrote a letter in support of Kova\u010di\u010d, demanding his return as a host of Na Telo and guarantees of journalistic independence in Mark\u00edza broadcasting.\nPersonal life\nIn 2017, Kova\u010di\u010d married the journalist Zuzana Hanzelov\u00e1.

    "\nRodrigo Hernando Gonz\u00e1lez (born 16 January 1982) is a Spanish football manager. He managed only in the lower divisions of his country, while also serving as head coach of Ulaanbaatar City of the Mongolian Premier League in 2016 and having spells as an assistant in the top divisions of Portugal, Finland and Iran.\nEarly life and education\nHernando was born in Burgos, Castile and Le\u00f3n and raised in M\u00e1laga in Andalusia. Though his family were not interested in football and he did not play the game, he wanted to be a manager from the age of 6. He qualified as a physical education teacher, graduated with a master's degree from the Facultad de Ciencias de la Actividad F\u00edsica y del Deporte\u00a0 (Polytechnic University of Madrid) and holds a UEFA Pro Licence.\nAs of 2023, Hernando was living in Azagra, Navarre, with his wife and two young children.\nCareer\nEarly career and Mongolia\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Hernando was a coach in local M\u00e1laga CF's youth academy, in the early years of Sheikh Al-Thani's ownership of the club. He then moved to Dubai to work in the football school set up by former Real Madrid player Michel Salgado. In 2016, he became the first manager of Ulaanbaatar City FC in the Mongolian Premier League; he was the first Spanish manager in the country. The club's owner Dashnyam Ganzorig was a fan of Real Madrid and demanded a manager of that nationality, who was found through a Spanish agency specialising in East Asia.\nAssistant jobs and return to Spain\nIn December 2016, Hernando returned to the Iberian Peninsula as assistant manager to compatriot Pedro G\u00f3mez Carmona at G.D. Estoril-Praia in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. The pair and another Spanish assistant were sacked in March 2017. After several weeks as an assistant with Sein\u00e4joen Jalkapallokerho in the Finnish Veikkausliiga he was given his first head coach job in Spain in October 2017, at Pe\u00f1a Sport FC. The Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B club had lost all 11 of their games that season before his appointment, while he took 11 points from his first possible 15; the campaign ended in relegation.\nIn 2018\u201319, Hernando managed CD Izarra in the same division. He was sacked in March with the team at risk of relegation and having won twice in 14 home games. In the new fourth-tier Segunda Federaci\u00f3n, he led Racing Rioja CF until being fired in January 2022 while in third place; his team were unbeaten until the previous November.\nIran\nHernando went back to Asia and assistant managership in 2022, at Naft Masjed Soleyman F.C. in the Persian Gulf Pro League. In December, new owners appointed new coaching staff, and Hernando reached an agreement for his contract to be terminated as he shared no common language with his new colleagues. He owed taxes for his employment but had never been officially registered to pay taxes, due to being dismissed during his visa application. From 21 December until 9 January 2023 he was unable to leave the country. His service in Iran coincided with the Mahsa Amini protests; Hernando, who was living alone, took advice to avoid demonstrations and concentrate on football.\nReturn to Izarra\nIn March 2023, Hernando returned to Izarra in the Segunda Federaci\u00f3n, replacing the sacked \u00c1lex Huerta. Three months later, having steered the club from relegation, he decided against remaining there.\nHernando's third spell at Izarra began in March 2024, as the third manager of a season that had seen the club place three points above the relegation play-off. They eventually had to take part in that play-off, retaining their place in the league by beating SD Formentera 1\u20130 both home and away.\n",
    "\nThis article contains Balinese alphabet. Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of Balinese characters.\nThe Nusa Penida Balinese language (referred to by its speakers as basa Nosa) is a dialect of the Balinese language spoken by the Nak Nus\u00e9 people, a sub-group of the Balinese people inhabiting Nusa Penida, an island located to the south of Bali which is administratively part of Klungkung Regency. This dialect is considered the most unique and distinct among Balinese dialects, as it is mutually unintelligible with standard Balinese and other Balinese dialects spoken in mainland Bali, both orally and in written form. Due to its significant differences from other Balinese dialects, and the extensive use of vocabulary not found in the Balinese dictionary, it is exceedingly difficult for mainland Balinese individuals to communicate fluently and directly with the Nusa Penida community.\nClassification\nLinguistically, the Nusa Penida Balinese is considered a dialect of Balinese, which is a Malayo-Polynesian language within the Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa branch of the Austronesian language family. This dialect is regarded as being closely related to the Bali Aga dialect, which is a derivative of Old Balinese.\nThis dialect is often classified as a sub-dialect of another variant within the Balinese language, namely the Bali Aga language. This classification arises because the Nusa Penida dialect shares linguistic features with the Aga dialect, which Jendra et al. (1997) described as follows:\nThe distribution of the phoneme /h/ at the beginning and middle of words;\nThe presence of the endings /-\u00f1\u0259/ and /-c\u0259/, which are allophonic morphemes of the ending /-\u0259/;\nThe speakers' intonation tends to have a faster tempo and stronger stress;\nVocabulary in the Nusa Penida dialect resembles that of the Aga dialect and its other sub-dialects.\nHowever, there is a notable difference between the two dialects, namely the loss or reduction of the phoneme /a/ at the end of words.\nDistribution\nCurrently, the Nusa Penida dialect is widely used only in Nusa Penida in Klungkung Regency. However, it is important to note that not all communities in Nusa Penida use the Nusa Penida dialect. There are several groups of people who communicate using different dialects. On the islands of Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan, which are located next to Nusa Penida, as well as in a small part of Nusa Penida close to these islands, there is a distinct dialect that is quite different from the Nusa Penida dialect. One of the most striking differences is in words like \"eda\" (you) and \"kola\" (I) in the Nusa Penida dialect. Speakers of the Nusa Lembongan dialect use words like \"cai\" or \"ci\" (you) and \"cang\" (I). Another example is \"\u0259nd\u0259k\" (Nusa Penida dialect) and \"tusing\" (Nusa Lembongan dialect), \"geleng-cenik\", \"hangken-kenken\", and so on. Only 13 out of 16 villages in Nusa Penida use the Nusa Penida dialect. The remaining villages either speak the Nusa Lembongan dialect or a dialect resembling mainland Klungkung Balinese.\nThe Nusa Penida dialect is also used outside Nusa Penida, mainly due to the migration of its speakers following the eruption of Mount Agung in 1963. Significant speakers relocated to southern Sumatra, particularly to Bandar Lampung, Palembang, Mesuji, and East Lampung.\nHistory\nThere is a hypothesis that the existence of the dialect is linked to the invasion of Majapahit led by Gajah Mada against the Kingdom of Bali. After his inauguration ceremony as Patih Amangkubhumi Majapahit (great king) of Majapahit in 1336\u00a0CE (1258 Saka), Gajah Mada and his troops successfully conquered the Kingdom of Bali, including Nusa Penida, which was referred to as Gurun in the Palapa Oath by Gajah Mada. This conquest is believed to have influenced the linguistic conditions on both Bali Island and Nusa Penida.\nAccording to Zoetmulder, Majapahit warriors who proudly identified themselves as Javanese nobility did not want to return to Majapahit. Therefore, Laksana (1977) suspects that some of the Majapahit warriors did not return to Java. They felt comfortable staying on Nusa Penida. It is possible that Majapahit warriors who were not nobility, who still retained their Old Javanese language,  marked by the phoneme /h/ at the beginning of words in some of their vocabulary, as documented in Zoetmulder's Old Javanese\u2013Indonesian Dictionary (2006) and Wojowasito's Kawi\u2013Indonesian Dictionary (1997), have influenced the language on Nusa Penida.\nVocabulary\nBelow is a comparison of several vocabulary words in the Nusa Penida dialect and standard Balinese:\nIn standard Balinese, the initial letter  is commonly used, whereas in the Nusa Penida dialect,  is replaced and pronounced as . Additionally, the letters  and  are more frequently used at the beginning of words, such as in homah, honya, hoba, hobat, and poles.\nSee also\nNusa Penida\n",

    "311 BC battle\nThe Battle of Myus was a military engagement that took place in 311 BC. The battle occurred in Syria or more generally, the Levant, at an unknown location named Myus, between an Antigonid force led by Demetrius I Poliorcetes and a Ptolemaic force under the command of a close associate of Ptolemy, Cilles. It concluded with an Antigonid victory, permitting to mitigate the defeat of Gaza, and likely led to the Peace of 311 BC among the various Diadochi.\nBackground\nThe Third War of the Diadochi saw Ptolemy and Seleucus, who had taken refuge in Egypt, opposing Antigonus I Monophtalmus and his son, Demetrius I. The latter was in charge of the Antigonid armies in Syria. During a decisive confrontation in Palestine, less than a year earlier, Demetrius was defeated by his adversaries and had to flee the battlefield, during the Battle of Gaza. Ptolemy then sent one of his generals, a Macedonian named Cilles, described as one of his close associates by Diodorus Siculus, to take advantage of the victory at Gaza and decisively defeat Demetrius in Syria.\nBattle\nCourse\nThe sources are particularly vague and elusive regarding this battle: it took place at an unknown location, likely in Syria or the Levant, named Myus. Demetrius set an ambush for his adversary and managed to destroy a sufficiently significant portion of their forces, although ancient sources varied between the entirety and a small number, to repel the Egyptian incursion.\nAfter receiving news of the battle, while he was in Celaenae, Antigonus responded by moving towards the Levant to assist his son in case of an Egyptian counter-offensive, but it never came. He also emulated publicly his son for the victory. Instead, this victorious ambush seemed to establish a status quo, freezing the Levantine borders; it likely also tilted the balance slightly in favor of the Antigonids, after the defeat at Gaza, in the context of the upcoming peace of 311 BC.\nLegacy\nBesides Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, and Pausanias who mention the event, Plautus referenced it in one of his works, Curculio (The Weevil).\n",
    "Indian Jat royal state (1684 to 1726)\nFatehpur State, or the Principality of Fatehpur, was a Jat state ruled by Sogarwar or Sogharia Jats from 1684 to 1726 AD.\nOrigin\nThe Sogharia Jats were migrants from Punjab. They trace their name from a place in Sirsa district of Haryana. Dispossessed from Sirsa, Ram Baksh Singh Sogharia, a zamindar warrior of this clan, immigrated to Pahari pargana, which later became the centre of this clan. \nThakur Ram Baksh Singh established Sogar and 4 other villages. He had three sons named Dau Singh, Gumra Singh and Dana Singh. Thakur Ram Baksh was succeeded by Thakur Dau Singh and his second son founded the towns of Papra and Kaithwara. Dau Singh was followed by Hira Singh, Mangal Singh, Naranjan Singh, Chitan Singh, Jaiman Singh, and Arjan Singh.\nThese people, all Sogharia Jats, were zamidar chiefs of a few villages, and one of Arjan Singh's son named Baru Singh rose to prominence. He rose from the rank of a village chief to a thakur of a patti of 30 villages. He also laid the foundation of the Sogar fort.\nRule\nIn the second half of 17th century the state of Sogar came under Thakur Achal Singh aka Achala Jat. He was the brother-in-law of Thakur Bhao Singh (father of Raja Badan Singh Sinsinwar of Deeg-Bharatpur) and joined other Jat states against Mughals. Achal Singh made Sogar his stronghold and was involved in anti-mughal activities and always showcased his rebellious attitude towards imperial mughal govt. He established several fortresses (garhis) around Sogar including Ajan, Mahari, Sebhora, Sehrora, Stara and Mahgawa. He soon became the supreme ruler in lower Kated tract (i.e. between Bharatpur and Pahari) ousting the mughal mansabdars and thanedars from the region. He annexed a large area of Khalisa (mughal crownland) and blocked the traffic between Agra and Ajmer via Hindon and Bayana parganas.\nThakur Achal Singh Sogaria successfully carved out an independent state or principality out of the Mughal Empire. He also established stations (thanas) in Bhusawar pargana and started extracting revenue from the Bayana pargana's villages. He with other three Dung leaders carried on depredations to the gates of Agra and besieged Shaista Khan (mughal subedar of Agra) in 1686 AD.\nChronology of rulers of Fatehpur-Sogar\n",
    "Artificial ski slope that never opened\n53\u00b028\u203230\u2033N 2\u00b054\u203204\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff53.4751\u00b0N 2.9010\u00b0E\ufeff / 53.4751; 2.9010\nKirkby ski slope was an artificial ski slope that was built in Kirkby, near Liverpool, England, in the 1970s. The ski slope never opened and was source of considerable controversy around how it was built and funded.\nHistory\nKirkby\nKirkby saw rapid growth from a small settlement of 3,000 people in 1951 to town of 50,000 people in just ten years. From 1958, the town had been administered by Kirkby Urban District Council but in 1974 a new administrative area was to be formed, known as Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley.\nUnder council leader Dave Tempest, Kirkby Urban District Council wanted to spend any left over money they had on a project before the new council was formed and the idea of a dry ski slope was proposed by council architect, Eric Spencer Stevenson.\nConstruction\nThe land chosen for the ski slope was situated between the M57 motorway and the (since demolished) Kirkby Stadium.\nWork started on the 45 metres (148\u00a0ft) slope in November 1973 with the cost estimated to be around \u00a390,000. Local schoolchildren were asked to volunteer to help lay the artificial surface, but when there were not enough volunteers, the council ended up paying them 25p an hour to work at weekends.\nSome concern was raised by locals that the slope not only faced into the sun, but that it ran towards a major road. A BBC Nationwide report pointed out that there was ample land in the other direction that could have been used instead if the slope was oriented in the opposite direction. After its completion, the slope needed additional funding to sort out bumps that had appeared on the surface and to provide railings to stop skiers falling off.\nProblems\nThe slope had been intended to open in 1974, but in autumn 1975 the project was abandoned due to concerns it was unsafe. No one had been allowed to ski on the slope as the council's insurers would not permit it, deeming it too dangerous. The Liverpool Echo reported in August 1975 on the slope, stating that bubbles had appeared in the artificial surface caused by thousands of tons of earth subsiding within the slope. Weeds were also beginning to protrude from the surface. The Echo claimed that the council had spent around \u00a3150,000 on the project by that point, in sharp contrast to the \u00a312,000 spent by Wirral Council in the construction of their ski slope at The Oval Sports Centre in Bebington. \nBy December 1975, the Echo was reporting that an insurance company was refusing to insure properties close to the slope as they thought the slope posed a danger. The insurers were demanding that the height of the slope be reduced and daily checks be performed on it in the advent of bad weather.\nDismantling\nThe artificial surface of the ski slope was removed and sold in 1976, though the remaining mound was left visible for several years before being fully removed.\nControversy\nJournalists Steve Scott and Brian Whitaker of the investigative newspaper, Liverpool Free Press spent considerable time looking into the circumstances of the ski slope. Printed between 1971 and 1977, it was ran by young journalists who worked for the Liverpool Echo and were unsatisfied with the lack of serious investigative reporting at the paper. The investigation was started when Free Press received an anonymous letter, claiming to be from a Knowsley Council employee, who claimed that builder George Leatherbarrow had charged the council \u00a325,000 for the earth for the slope but had not paid for it himself.\nBy November 1974, the Free Press had established that the earth had been sourced via an advert placed in the Liverpool Echo in December 1973, shortly after construction started. The advert offered: \"Free tip in Kirkby for all suitable material\". Bore hole samples gathered by Knowsley Council would later show that the earth contained wood, bricks, colliery waste, sand and ashes - all of which would contribute to the subsidence already seen.\nInvestigations by the Free Press would also uncover that the slope was built on land the council did not own and over a mains water pipe.  Knowsley Council later had to buy the land off Liverpool council. Planning permission for the project was not granted until November 1973 despite an order for the artificial surface being placed in July of that year.\nAs the investigations progressed, the Free Press found that:\nTenders for work had been granted without the usual process being followed\nLeatherbarrow had completed most of the work on the slope before a contract with the council was signed\nIn addition, the paper discovered that Stevenson and Tempest had received trips and gifts, both in connection with the work given to George Leatherbarrow. Tempest and Stevenson had received extentions to their houses built by Letherbarrow's firm with materials that had come from a council estate being built in Kirkby by Leatherbarrow. The Free Press were also able to prove that Leatherbarrow had also gift",

The Unified Agenda is compiled by the General Services Administration's Regulatory Information Service Center in cooperation with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) (OIRA is a component office of the Office of Management and Budget in the Executive Office of the President).  The regulatory agenda is then published in the Federal Register.

In practice, the regulatory agenda has not lived up to Congress\u2019 aspirations.\nFirst, though by law the regulatory agenda is to be published in October and April of each year, agencies tend to be many months late.  For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission's October 2023 regulatory agenda was published at 89 Fed. Reg. 9728 (Feb. 9, 2024).  The Department of Commerce's October 2023 regulatory agenda was published at 89 Fed. Reg. 9548 (Feb. 9, 2024).\nSecond, the same statute that requires agencies to publish a regulatory agenda provides that there is no penalty for an agency that either acts outside its published agenda listing, or publishes no agenda notice at all.\nSome states or state agencies implement similar regulatory agendas, for example Arizona and Colorado Department of Revenue.\n",

Foyt\nBignotti became a successful mechanic in midget car racing in California in the late 1940s, winning championships as chief mechanic for driver Fred Agabashian and allowing him the quit his full-time job working as a shipbuilder. However, as the popularity of midget-car racing declined at the end of the decade, Bignotti was forced to leave racing behind for several years and take a job in his mother-in-law's flower shop. He returned to the chief mechanic role in 1954, when Agabashian asked him to join his team for the Indianapolis 500. Agabashain went on to finish sixth in the race, and Bignotti became a near-permanent figure in open-wheel racing for the next several decades. In 1956, Bignotti joined forces with Bob Bowes, the president of the Bowes Seal-Fast Corporation, to form Bignotti-Bowes Racing, where Bignotti served as co-owner and chief mechanic. The team found moderate success with drivers Johnny Boyd and Jud Larson in their first years. In 1960, the team signed A. J. Foyt to drive. With the combination of Bignotti as chief mechanic and Foyt as driver, the team dominated American open-wheel racing, winning four championships and 27 races, including winning ten races in the 13-race 1964 USAC season. Despite the team's success, Bignotti and Foyt fought frequently, leading to Bignotti briefly departing his chief mechanic role several times before the pairing permanently separated mid-way through the 1965 season.\nThe March 83C co-owned by Bignotti that won the 1983 Indianapolis 500 with Tom Sneva driving.\nFor 1966, Bignotti served as chief mechanic for the team run by oil magnate John W. Mecom Jr. for the Indianapolis 500. Graham Hill won the race for the team, while teammate Jackie Stewart led the most laps before dropping out with a mechanical failure. At the close of the decade, Bignotti joined Parnelli Jones' Vel's Parnelli Jones Racing team, finding more success. Serving as chief mechanic for Al Unser, Bignotti won the 1970 and 1971 Indianapolis 500 as well as the 1970 USAC Championship, winning ten races during the season and equaling the feat achieved by himself and Foyt in 1964. Bignotti won two further USAC Championships with Joe Leonard in 1971 and 1972. Bignotti joined forces with Patrick Racing beginning in 1973, finding success with driver Gordon Johncock with victory in the 1973 Indianapolis 500 and the 1976 USAC Championship. In the early 1980s, Bignotti co-owned a team again, joining forces with True Value CEO Dan Cotter to form Bignotti-Cotter Racing. With driver Tom Sneva, the team won the 1983 Indianapolis 500\u2014Bignotti's final \"500\" win. The Bignotti-Cotter team appeared for three more seasons fielding cars for Roberto Guerrero in the CART championship before the team folded and Bignotti retired. Bignotti's older brother Al co-worked as a mechanic during the Indianapolis 500 victories of 1966, 1970, 1971, and 1983.\nAfter retirement, Bignotti remained in touch with many of his former drivers, notably A. J. Foyt, with whom he remained friends long after their careers ended despite the fights from their time working together. Bignotti was also an avid golfer and played up until age 90.\nBignotti died in his sleep in his home in Las Vegas, Nevada, on September 27, 2013, at age 97.  Bignotti is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nAwards and honors\nBignotti has been inducted in to the following halls of fame:\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame (1975)\nInternational Motorsports Hall of Fame (1993)\nMotorsports Hall of Fame of America (1993)\nNational Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame (2003)\nUSAC Hall of Fame (2014)\nWest Coast Stock Car/Motorsports Hall of Fame (2018)\n",
    "\nThe 2024 Gauteng provincial election was held on 29 May 2024, concurrently with the 2024 South African general election, to elect the 73 members of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. \nThe African National Congress (ANC), led by current Premier Panyaza Lesufi, lost its majority in the Provincial Legislature for the first time since the end of apartheid in 1994. The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), led by Solly Msimanga, gained two seats despite a very small swing against the party. With a margin of just 7.32% between the ANC and the DA, Gauteng was the closest province in the country.\nGauteng was a highly-contested province, as it is the most populous province of South Africa, as well as the de facto economic hub of South Africa. It is also home to Johannesburg, the most populous city in South Africa.\nBackground\nMain article: 2019 Gauteng provincial election\nThe 2019 provincial election was won by the ruling ANC, but with a reduced seat total of only 37 seats, the threshold for a majority. The DA underperformed and lost support in this election, losing a total of three seats, which only gave the party 20 seats in the provincial legislature. The EFF grew its support and won three additional seats. The FF+ gained two seats, while the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) retained its sole seat. The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) returned to the provincial legislature by winning one seat.\nResults\nAftermath\nThe ANC lost its majority for the first time in the provincial party's history, losing 9 seats in the legislature. The DA won 2 more seats and the PA won 2 seats, while the VF+ lost one seat. Finally, the new MK, ActionSA, Rise Mzansi and BOSA parties all won seats, and the EFF, IFP and ACDP all retained the same share of seats as the previous election. As a result, no party won overall control of the legislature, forcing consideration of a coalition government. The new legislature was scheduled to meet on June 15 to be sworn in and consider election of the Premier, Deputy Premier, heads of committees and provincial delegates to the National Council of Provinces.\n",

    "The Ainu-Minoan languages are a hypothetical macrofamily proposed by Alexander Akulov (2018) and supported by Tresi Nonno (2021). It is effectively a variant of the Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian languages, which is rejected by most linguists.\nInternal classification\nAlexander Akulov (2015) is the first paper trying to prove a relation between the Ainu languages and Great Andamanese languages, in a hypothetical Ainu-Andamanese language family. For this, he uses the Prefixation Ability Index and the Verbal Grammar Correlation Index, two language comparison techniques developed by himself. According to him, this proves that Ainu would originate from further south than its present location, and that the two families would be about as distant as English and Persian (two Indo-European languages). He rejects the hypothesis that Ainu is related to the Austroasiatic, Austronesian or Altaic families, as he considers the genetic classification of languages to be based on syntax and grammar rather on the basis of lexicon, but supposes that Ainu-Andamanese may be linked to the West Papuan and North Halmahera families.\nAfterwards, with the same methods, he extends his hypothesis to the Sino-Tibetan languages, forming an Ainu-Andamanese-Sino-Tibetan family. According to himself, Ainu is the closest to Qiang, which he explains by possible influence from Austric on Mandarin.\nHe then incorporates languages such as Northwest Caucasian, Minoan and Hattic into the macrofamily, which he renames the \"Ainu-Minoan languages\", excluding a connection with Etruscan and the Hurro-Urartian languages due to their absence of prefixation and usage of suffixation and postpositions, and opening up possible connections to other languages. He then proposes the following classification:\nAinu-Minoan\nGreat Andamanese\nAinu\nSino-Tibetan\nNorthwest Caucasian\nMinoan\nHattic\n\u00a0\nLater, using words he considers to be cognates with Ket and Proto-Yeniseian with the Northwest Caucasian languages and Hattic, as well as loanwords of the hypothetical language of paja ul de\u02c0\u014b in Kildin S\u00e1mi, he puts the Yeniseian family and paja ul de\u02c0\u014b as being of Ainu-Minoan stock. He then reforms the classification, this time being split into two branches:\nAinu-Minoan\nWestern branch\nNorthwest Caucasian\nHattic\nMinoan\nYeniseian\nPaja ul de\u02c0\u014b\nEastern branch\nSino-Tibetan\nAinu\nGreat Andamanese\nHe considers later that paja ul de\u02c0\u014b is intermediate between Yeniseian and other western Ainu-Minoan languages.\nThe Northeast Caucasian languages are later also included, but Akulov (2021a) criticizes Starostin's and other linguists' methods of comparing the \"basic\" lexicon. He also rejectds a connection between Northeast Caucasian and Hurro-Urartian.\nLater, he proposes to add Sumerian to his hypothesis with the same methods, and writes off other hypotheses of the affiliation of Sumerian to be \"na\u00efve and amateurish\" or looking \"like a plot for a vaudeville sketch\". He supposes Sumerian to be particularly close to Northeast Caucasian.\nProto-language\nProto-Ainu-Minoan is believed by its proponents to have existed around 50 000 to 60 000 years ago, thus being very difficult to reconstruct, and the different branches would have separated after that time. The reconstructed form of \"man\" for Proto-Ainu-Minoan is *wVd, based on proto-forms of its constituent languages. Based on genetic analysis of haplogroup Y-D, present in Qiang, Tibetans, Andamanese and Ainu, Akulov supposes that the eastern branch of Ainu-Minoan originated in the Bay of Bengal. According to Tresi Nonno (2021), the Great Andamanese languages were the first to diverge from Eastern Ainu-Minoan.\nContradictions\nThe general consensus among linguists is that the language families are unrelated. In the case of certain language families, there is debate on the relations between them.\nA possible connection between Ainu and Great Andamanese has only been studied by Akulov, but Ainu and Great Andamanese are generally considered to be individual language families unrelated to any other.\nSee also\nMacrofamily\nDen\u00e9\u2013Caucasian languages\nNotes\n^ Akulov refers to his hypothetical language family by this name.\n",
    "1811 rebellion in Peru\nThe Tacna insurrection of 1811 was an autonomist movement that occurred in Tacna in June 1811 that proclaimed the freedom of Peru against the Spanish government of Viceroy Jos\u00e9 Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, with Tacna being the first and the only city that rose in 1811, anticipating the advance of the Argentine armies in Upper Peru.\nHistory\nIt did not have its own flag nor did it use the Argentine flag. Furthermore, unlike the movement led by Francisco Antonio de Zela, it assumed an autonomist character, that is, it faced the Viceroy, but not the King of Spain. This is partly because when Zela rose, the Junta of Buenos Aires decided not to break with Spain yet (due to the Ferdinand VII strategy), based on the legal theory outlined by Mariano Moreno and followed by Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli.\nCastelli had sent emissaries and agents to Arequipa and Tacna communicating the news of his advance to the independentists of both cities in the hope of receiving their support while General Manuel Belgrano sent the chief Ram\u00f3n Copaja to establish communications with Francisco Antonio de Zela, a criollo from Lima, to start an uprising. The plan was that while the main royalist forces fought Castelli's advance, Zela would raise the southern region of Peru, leaving them isolated and without support. He, together with the tacne\u00f1o Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez, the priest Juan Jos\u00e9 de la Fuente and the chief Toribio Ara organised a small troop that deposed the local royalist subdelegate without shedding blood. It was then that Zela declared his adherence to the government of Buenos Aires and his desire for Peru's independence. The objective was clear, to contribute to the consolidation of the government of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata to confront in better conditions the Royal Army of Peru based in Lima under the command of Viceroy Abascal.\nThe programme and the edicts published by Zela excluded from its political and social objectives the demands and interests of the indigenous and black sectors of the city. Thus, it can be said that the rebellion was based on a small sector of local criollo merchants and landowners linked to the mule industry with Upper Peru (Zela, Siles, Argando\u00f1a, Herrera, etc.) who led the movement, but who needed mestizo allies: merchants and muleteers, like the Ara family, many of these merchants having family ties with each other. A minority indigenous peasant or community sector was camped on the Caramolle pampa only on the fourth day of the uprising. These objectives were based on Mariano Moreno's republican political programme of 1810 and the agreements of the constituent assembly in the following years. This plan contained the legal principle of the retroversion of sovereignty to the people due to the absence of the king.\nBut on June 20, Castelli was defeated by Jos\u00e9 Manuel de Goyeneche in the battle of Guaqui, forcing him to retreat, which meant the condemnation of the republican movement since he was thus isolated. While Zela, on the same day and unaware of what happened, attacked with his men the two military barracks of Tacna, proclaiming himself military commander of the square and Rabino Gabino Barrios, colonel of infantry militias, and curaca Toribio Ara, commander of the cavalry division. Four days later, they had more than 1,000 men from Tarata, Sama, Ylabaya and Locumba.\nBut on the 25th of the same month, news of the royalist victory in Guaqui reached Tacna, which caused great confusion among the rebels. The royalists took advantage of the situation to disrupt the movement and arrest Zela, who was taken to Lima where he was sentenced to life imprisonment in the prison at Chagres, Panama, where he died on July 18, 1819, at 50 years of age.\nThe uprisings demonstrated that they were only instigated by the Junta of Buenos Aires in order to facilitate its military campaigns in Upper Peru, while the attitude assumed by the main merchants of the square was, initially, one of prudent indifference, and then they joined the triumphant royalist restoration, without there being any greater initiative among the population.\nSee also\nPeruvian War of Independence\n",
    "American planter, patriot and politician\nPeter Perkins (March 26, 1739 \u2013 February 12, 1813) was an American patriot, planter and politician who represented Pittsylvania County, Virginia during the final session of the House of Burgesses, several of the Virginia Revolutionary Conventions and in the first session of the Virginia House of Delegates, as well as led the county militia during the American Revolutionary War.\nEarly life and education\nPossibly the eldest surviving son born in then-vast Goochland County (in a part that later became Hanover County) to the former Bethania Hardin and her farmer husband, Col. Nicholas Perkins (1718\u20131762). His brother Constant Perkins (1747-1790) may have been the eldest son, for he inherited their father's Pittsylvania home (which was torn down circa 1905), and also served as in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Pittsylvania County 1782-1788, but had no children during his marriage to Agatha Marr. Their younger brother Nicholas Perkins (1745-1800) would marry Leah Pryor of Orange County, North Carolina and in 1767 erected the first separate Baptist Church in Virginia (known as the Dan River Church) but would later move his family to Tennessee. Another brother was Thomas Hardin Perkins (1757\u20131838). This man's sisters included: Bethania (1743-1809, who married Col. Absalom Bostick and moved to what was Rowan County but is now Stokes County, North Carolina), Anne (1752-1829, who married Joseph Henry Scales and moved to Henry County, Virginia), Mary (1754-1798, who married Thomas Hardemon and moved to Davidson County, Tennessee) and Elizabeth (1759-1819, who married Peter Hairston and remained in Pittsylvania County although her husband also owned plantations in North Carolina). Their father, Col. Nicholas Perkins, moved his family south to the Dan River in what became Pittsylvania County, and started a plantation at Berry Hill about 1745, which this son inherited upon his father's death.\nCareer\nPeter Perkins invested in real estate in Pittsylvania County as well as in North Carolina. He also operated an ordinary (tavern and inn) at his home, and farmed tobacco using enslaved labor. Although Peter Perkins does not appear in the published 1787 Virginia tax census, in 1782 he paid taxes for 25 slaves in Pittsylvania County, his brother Nicholas was taxed for 26 slaves and Constant Perkins for 18 slaves.\nDecades earlier, Pittsylvania voters elected Perkins and fellow militia captain Benjamin Lankford their representatives to what proved to be the final session of the House of Burgesses, which began in 1775. After Governor Dunmore prorogued (suspended) that assembly, Pittsylvania voters elected Perkins and Lankford and the men they had replaced as burgesses (Hugh Innes who lived on in the western part and would help found new Henry County in 1777, and John Donelson who was Pittsylvania's county lieutenant but planned to move to Tennessee) their representatives to the first Virginia Revolutionary Conventions, and Perkins and Lankford to most of the others. However, no record exists that Lankford nor Perkins actually appeared at the Third Revolutionary Convention and Perkins was not elected to the final convention, nor as to the first session of the Virginia House of Delegates. Voters did elect Perkins as one of Pittsylvania County's two delegates in 1777, this time alongside Abraham Shelton.\nMeanwhile, during the conflict, the patriotic Perkins served on the county' Committee of Safety since its inception in 1775 (among 31 members, alongside his wealthy brothers-in-law John Wilson and Peter Wilson Jr.),  as well as led a company of the Pittsylvania County militia, rising in rank from captain (one of 27 in the county during the conflict) to major to lieutenant colonel. However, authorities disagree as to whether Perkins ever led troops in the field. Although local historian Maud Carter Clement believed Capt. Perkins led the local militia during the French and Indian War (decades earlier) and at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in March 1781, modern historians have not found corroborative documentation. Like fellow Pittsylvania delegate Abraham Shelton, Perkins' major revolutionary wartime activity involved gathering supplies for the troops within the county, which held one of the Commonwealth's major depots at Peytonsburg. During the three months that Perkins' home served as a hospital as discussed below, Perkins also operated a ferry. Perkins also at various times served as the Pittsylvania county sheriff. His brother-in-law John Wilson became colonel of the county's troops and ultimately county lieutenant (chief administrative officer in that era; in both cases succeeding Robert Williams who in 1775 had been the colonel and succeeded John Donelson as county lieutenant in 1778-1779).\nAfter the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in March 1781, Perkins' home, Berry Hill, along with nearby plantation houses of his brothers, and of William Harrison (who had emigrated from Gooc",
    "Political event that began the 2024 French general election\nOn 9 June 2024, French President Emmanuel Macron announced the dissolution of the National Assembly.\nBackground\nPrevious to the dissolution of the National Assembly, the Nahel Merzouk riots of 2023 and 2023 pension reform strikes had caused a period of major instability in France, and disdain against the current President and ruling government. Other older protests and riots such as the 2018 yellow vests protests against Macron and then the anti-lockdown protests, along with vaccine skepticism, all further reinforced the dislike of the government. And despite these older events not having permitted a Renaissance loss in the 2022 presidential and legislative elections, it is the combination of these recent events with them that culminated in the collapse of Renaissance votes in the 2024 European elections. Though, the loss in the European parliamentary elections had not affected the decision to dissolve the National Assembly as it had been decided previously. It was most likely due to the known far-right wave sweeping over France.\nEvents\nFormation of the New Popular Front\nFrom the day of the announcement of the dissolution, many leftist party leaders called for the formation of a \"popular front\" against the National Rally. The day after, this was done as the leaders convened and created a coalition, called the New Popular Front, against the far-right.\nCollapse of Les R\u00e9publicains\nThe Les R\u00e9publicains party, the largest center-right party in France since the mid 20th century, faced a catastrophic crisis following an announcement from Eric Ciotti saying that he seeked to form a coalition with the RN. This immediately faced backlash from the vast majority of the party and many called for him to resign. Initially, the rest of the party planned to meet in the LR headquarters as to vote on wether to expulse him or not. This was, however, stopped by Eric Ciotti himself by locking the headquarters with him inside, forcing them to meet elsewhere. He was then removed from party leadership, despite his protests, unanimously.\nOn June 14th, a court in Paris ruled in Ciotti's favor and re-instated him as leader of the party and reversed his exclusion, though this did not prevent multiple legislators from leaving the party beforehand.\nCrisis in the Reconquest Party\nOn the 12th of June, Marion Mar\u00e9chal, vice-president of the Reconqu\u00eate party, reached out to the Rassemblement National as to create an electoral alliance, however this was rejected by both the RN and Eric Zemmour, president of the Reconquest Party, as both did not want to associate with the other. As a consequence, Marion Mar\u00e9chal and three other members left the party and declared their support of the RN.\nReactions\nFollowing the dissolution of the French National Assembly, many different reactions erupted in face of the incoming legislative elections. Many applauded this decision, but others were horrified.\nThe Left\nThe Socialist Party, led by Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, reacted quite negatively and said that \"Macron gave in to the demands of Jordan Bardella\" and that it was a \"dangerous game with democracy and European institutions\", being \"flabbergasted\" by the decision. Olivier Faure, general secretary of the Socialists, invited the left to work on a \"useful rally\", as there was a \"difference of strength that had evolved\".\nFor Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the LFI, things were completely different. To the opposite of what Raph\u00e4el said, he argued that Macron \"had reason to dissolve it, for there was no more legitimity to the politics that were his\", also adding \"there is no other serious and immediate option that to vote\". Manuel Bompard, one of his fellow party members, completed his view by stating that \"we are constructing an alternative to the far-right\" and \"we are ready\".\nThe PCF (French Communist Party) shares this view, with it's national secretary, Fabien Roussel, publicly expressing that he \"is not scared of these elections\" and \"it's amazing to be able to retake control of our politics when we feel that we are losing it\". Though, he added that the other leftist parties do cooperate with eachother and they are working to create a \"pact for France\". \nThe Right\nThose who seem to benefit the most from this announcement, the National Rally, reacted as greatly as the left. Marine le Pen, the parliamentary party leader and most important figure of the party, stated that they are \"ready to take power if the people trust in us\".\nEric Ciotti, leader of the Les R\u00e9publicains party, declared that the dissolution was \"the only solution\" and that he would make \"no coalition nor deals\" with the \"government that had hurt France so much\".\nSee also\n2024 French legislative election\n2024 European Parliament election\n",

    "North Caucasian politician and \u00e9migr\u00e9 leader (1901\u20131981)\nMuhammad Said Shamil, also referred to in the North Caucasus as Muhammad Said Bey, or Said-Bek Shamil (1901 \u2013 21 March 1981) was a North Caucasian politician and \u00e9migr\u00e9 leader. The grandson of rebel leader Imam Shamil, Shamil was the monarch of the North Caucasian Emirate during the 1920\u20131921 Dagestan uprising before later going into exile. He was one of the leading figures of Prometheism, a Polish-led political project seeking to bring about the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and participated in several political projects by North Caucasian \u00e9migr\u00e9s such as the Committee for the Independence of the Caucasus\u00a0 and the People's Party of Caucasian Highlanders\u00a0 (which he led). Shamil played a significant role in encouraging anti-communism in the Arab and Islamic world during the interwar period.\nFamily and early life\nSaid (right) pictured with his father, Muhammad Kamil, in Ottoman propaganda\nMuhammad Said Shamil was born in 1901 to Muhammad Kamil and Naciba Khanum. Muhammad Kamil (1863\u20131951), born in Kaluga, was a general of the Ottoman Army and additionally the youngest son of Imam Shamil, one of the leaders of North Caucasian resistance to Russia amidst the Caucasian War. Naciba Khanum was the daughter of a teacher from Medina, named Muhammad Said Efendi. Said had two sisters, Nacia (1899\u20131983) and Nacabat (1916\u20131983).\nShamil was born in Constantinople (now Istanbul), the capital of the Ottoman Empire. He spent his earliest years in the Arab-majority lands of the Ottoman Empire before returning to the city to begin his education. According to his own recollections he studied at the elite Galatasaray High School. At this time he also became acquainted with other North Caucasian emigrants.\nShamil fought in the Ottoman Army during World War I. In 1916 he participated in a Lausanne meeting billed as the \"Congress of the 26 Oppressed Peoples of Russia\", organised by the Union des Nationalit\u00e9s of Juozas Gabrys.\nIn addition to his native Avar language, Shamil spoke Arabic, English, French, Russian, and Turkish. He married the daughter of Mehmet Faz\u0131l Pa\u015fa\u00a0, another Dagestani \u00e9migr\u00e9, but the two maintained a strictly formal relationship and never bore any children.\nDagestan uprising\nSee also: Dagestan uprising\nPortrait of Shamil by Xalilbeg Musajasul\u00a0, 1920\nAmidst the Russian Revolution the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus was established as an independent state on 11 May 1918. Later replaced by the North Caucasian Emirate, the region was invaded by the White Army in 1919 and subsequently by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1920, bringing an end to the region's independence. On 11 May 1920 a group of anti-communist North Caucasian political figures gathered in the village of Vedeno, where they selected Muhammad Kamil as leader of their uprising. As Muhammad Kamil was ill, he sent Said, then aged 19, to serve as leader on his behalf. Cem Kumuk, a Turkish historian, disputes the notion of Muhammad Kamil's illness, noting that he lived another 31 years, and suggests that his refusal may have been for other reasons.\nShamil arrived in Dagestan on 29 October 1920, having left under the protection of French forces. His arrival boosted the morale of the rebels, and he brought with him money and textiles intended to aid the uprising. According to contemporary accounts he expressed protest when asked to lead the rebellion, stating that he was too young to undertake such an activity. Despite his demurral, however, his appointment as leader continued, and he was formally inaugurated as a monarch during a meeting with imam Nazhmudin Gotsinsky\u00a0 in the village of Gidatli\u00a0. Shamil was given a bodyguard detachment consisting of 25 men from the village of Gimry, his own family's home village.\nKumuk states that Shamil's role in the uprising was likely intended to be to incur support from the Allied Powers and the Ottoman Empire's community of North Caucasians. He also provided significant moral support to the rebels as the grandson of Imam Shamil, and, despite his official status as the uprising's monarch, held little actual power.\nThe rebellion had varying degrees of success. The pro-Shamil troops, comprising about 500 men, were hampered by poor discipline and ultimately failed to defeat the Red Army. Shamil himself was wounded during the uprising, and he remained in hiding until March 1921, upon which he returned to Turkey and was admitted to a military hospital. He stayed hospitalised for the next two months.\nSoviet leaders Sergo Ordzhonikidze and Nazhmudin Samursky\u00a0 met with Ottoman general K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir in the Armenian city of Gyumri in mid-May 1921 and demanded that Karabekir hand over Shamil to them. Karabekir claimed that Shamil was an agent of the Allies and that he would be handed over to the Bolsheviks as soon as he was captured; in fact, it is unclear if he was ever subject to prosecution in Turkey for his role in the uprising, t",
    "Historic mosque in Bursa, Turkey\nThe Orhan Gazi Mosque (Turkish: Orhan Gazi Camii) is a historic mosque in Bursa, Turkey. It is named after the Ottoman ruler Orhan, who founded the mosque as part of a larger charitable complex. It is one of the oldest surviving monuments commissioned by the Ottoman dynasty.\nHistory\nThe Arabic foundation inscription over the mosque's entrance\nThe mosque was built by the Ottoman ruler Orhan (known as Orhan Gazi) and is dated to 1339\u201340 AD (740 AH), as attested by a surviving Arabic inscription over the gate. The mosque was damaged by fire during the siege of Bursa by the Karamanid ruler Mehmed II in 1413, with front fa\u00e7ade and portico being destroyed. The mosque was repaired in 1417 on the order of Sultan Mehmed I, who charged Bayezid Pasha, his grand vizier, with the task.\nThe oldest waqf document (vak\u0131f in Turkish) concerning the mosque is dated to 1360. An addition to it around 1400 describes it as a zaviye (or zawiya). Like other buildings of this type erected in the early Ottoman period, the Orhan Mosque was originally designed to serve Sufi dervishes, providing them with lodging and a venue for their meetings and rituals.\nThe current minaret dates from the 17th century, built over the base of an older minaret. Like many other historic structures in the city, the mosque was damaged in the 1855 Bursa earthquake and it was restored by French architect L\u00e9on Parvill\u00e9e\u00a0 in 1863\u20131864. The current painted decoration inside the mosque was created in 1864, according to an inscription over the mihrab. The conical lead cap of the minaret was redone in 1899. It was again restored in 1904.\nArchitecture\nThe mosque has a \"T-plan\" layout typical of many early Ottoman religious complexes in Bursa and elsewhere. It has a square central court covered by a dome, surrounded by three iwans, one branching off every side except the north side where the building entrance is located. Each iwan is also covered by a dome. The iwan on the south side is aligned with the qibla (direction of prayer) and contains the mosque's mihrab, which is colorfully painted. The entrance to the mosque is fronted by a domed portico.\nThe lack of documentation from Parvill\u00e9e's restoration makes it unclear how much of the current building is original. A study by Robert Ousterhout states that most of the walls are still original. Do\u011fan Kuban believes that the dome in front of the mihrab, over the qibla iwan, may date from the early 15th-century restoration by Bayezid Pasha. The upper walls and much of the rest of the roof are likely reconstructions.\nRobert Ousterhout compares the brick construction of the mosque and some of its related decorative details to Byzantine architecture, contrasting with the stone-built architecture of the Anatolian Seljuk tradition. He suggests that the same groups of builders could have been building both Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques in the region around during Orhan's time.\nElements of the mosque\nFront portico of the mosque, seen from the northwest\nDetail of the brickwork on the mosque's interior\nExterior of the mosque, seen from the southeast (with the qibla section on the left)\nView of the interior, looking towards the qibla iwan and the mihrab\nView of the interior, looking towards the entrance (with the two lateral iwans opening on the right and left)\nThe dome over the central court\nThe dome over the qibla iwan\nThe mihrab\nOther parts of the complex\nInterior of the Emir Han, a nearby caravanserai that was built to provide revenues for Orhan's religious complex\nLike many important religious monuments built by the Ottomans, Orhan's mosque was part of a larger religious and charitable complex, or k\u00fclliye. Of the other structures in this complex, only the mosque itself, the caravanserai (the Emir Han), and the hammam have survived. The mektep (primary school) was destroyed by the 1855 earthquake, the madrasa (Islamic college) once stood where the 19th-century Bursa town hall now stands, and the imaret (soup kitchen) stood nearby as late as 1907 but has since disappeared.\nThe Emir Han, an urban caravanserai (han), was originally built to provide revenues for Orhan's charitable complex. It still stands today within the bazaar district of Bursa, though it has been restored many times. It was damaged by fire in 1544 and repaired in 1634. Its gate was destroyed by an earthquake in 1674. The building was damaged again by fire in 1788 and damaged by the 1855 earthquake, and destroyed by a major fire in the bazaar district in 1958. It was restored in 1963. The building has a typical Ottoman caravanserai layout, consisting of a large central courtyard surrounded by a two-story gallery with rooms behind it, all covered by barrel vaults.\nOne of the domed chambers inside the former hammam of Orhan's complex, now a shopping complex\nThe hammam (public bathhouse) was a double hammam, meaning it had a men's section and a women's section built side-by-side. The men's section consists of a cold room, ",

    "Species of fish\nMalthopsis bradburyae, Bradbury's triangular batfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Ogcocephalidae, the deep-sea batfishes. This little known species is found in the western Indian Ocean off Tanzania and is named in honour of the American ichthyologist Margaret G. Bradbury.\nTaxonomy\nMalthopsis bradburyae was first formally described in 2013 by the Taiwanese ichthyologist Hans, Hsuan-Ching Ho with its type biology given as the western Indian Ocean off Tanzania at 22\u00b006'51\"S, 39\u00b054'E, from a depth of 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft). This species is a member of the M. annulifera species complex. The genus Malthopsis is the most basal genus of the \"Indo-Pacific clade\" of the family Ogcocephalidae. The family Ogcocephalidae is classified in the monotypic suborder Ogcocephaloidei within the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes in the 5th edition of Fishes of the World.\nEtymology\nMalthopsis bradburyae has the genus name Malthopsis which suffixes opsis, meaning \"resembles\", onto Malthe, a synonym of Ogcocephalus, although this genus has two gills on either side. The specific name, bradburyae, honours the American ichthyologist Margaret G. Bradbury of San Francisco State University, in recognition of her contribution to the study of Ogcocephalid batfishes, and for her friendship with Ho.\nDescription\nMalthopsis bradburyae has the dorsal fin supported by 5 or 6 soft rays while the anal fin is supported by 3 or 4 soft rays. The body is a flattened disc with the head higher than the disc. The rostrum is relatively long and pointed, pointing forward and not upwards. The eyes are small with a wide space between them with a deep groove. The upper surface is covered in scales that resemble bucklers and many spines. The lower body's surface is densely covered in small spines and small buckler-like scales. The scales on the breast are quite large. The buckler on the subopercle is blunt with no strong spines. The anal fin almost extends as far as the caudal fin when fully lowered. The colour of the preserved specimens is a plain creamy yellowish with some thin reticulated lines on the shoulder. This species attains a maximum published standard length of 7.2\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in),\nDistribution and habitat\nMalthopsis bradburyae is known from eight specimens collected in the Western Indian Ocean off the coast of Tanzania from the upper Continental shelf at a depth of around 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft).\n",

    "Brightest cluster galaxy in the constellation Sagittarius\nMRC 2011-298 is an elliptical galaxy with an active galactic nucleus, located in the constellation of Sagittarius. It is located 2.1 billion light-years away from Earth. MRC 2011-298 is the brightest cluster galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3670 and classfied as a dumbbell galaxy, an optical system with two galactic nuclei separated by 7\u2033, corresponding to \u224317 kpc according to the adopted cosmology, with similar magnitude and a common stellar halo. The galaxy is known to have an ellipticity of \u03b5\u2004=\u20040.28 and a position angle of PA\u2006\u2004=\u2004\u200624\u00b0 that is measured from north to east.\nCharacteristics\nMRC 2011-298 lies in the rich galaxy cluster which is located at redshift z\u2006\u2004=\u2004\u20060.142 . The cluster has an angular scale of 1\u2033\u2006\u2004=\u2004\u20062.4\u2006kpc, and with a luminosity distance of DL\u2006\u2004=\u2004\u2006645 Mpc. \u00a0\nMRC 2011-298 has a peculiar shape which its radio source was observed at 5.5 GHz using the Very Large Array (VLA). Instead of being classfied as either a FRI and FRII radio galaxy, the galaxy belongs to a class of X-shaped radio galaxies; it exhibits a pair of bright lobes in north to south direction with a pair of weak wings in the east going from east to west direction. These wings are oriented with an angle of about 90\u00b0, thus giving the structure its cross-like shape. Like other X-shaped radio galaxies, MRC 2011-298 has primary lobes with jets containing hotspots, but the wings does not hosts jets.\nThe flux density of the radio lobes in MRC 2011-298 is Slobes\u2004=\u2004294\u2005\u00b1\u200515 mJy, with east and the west wings have a flux density of SEw\u2004=\u200432\u2005\u00b1\u20052 mJy and SWw\u2004=\u200423\u2005\u00b1\u20051 mJy, respectively. The total length of the lobes is found to be llobes\u2004\u2243\u200460\u2033\u2004\u2243\u2004145 kpc, whereas the wings is lEw\u2004\u2243\u200475\u2033\u2004\u2243\u2004180 kpc and lWw\u2004\u2243\u200460\u2033\u2004\u2243\u2004145 kpc wide. Its ratio between the projected lengths of the wings and lobes of MRC 2011-298 is 2.8.\nThanks to researchers, the radio jets in MRC 2011-298 are found to be characterized by a curvature and an S-shaped structure. But no hotspots are present. Further observations suggests the wings are very faint (S\u2004< \u20045 mJy). The eastern one appears as diffuse emission, while the western wing is better defined.As for the north and south jets, the flux density is confimed to SSj\u2004=\u200417\u2005\u00b1\u20051 mJy and SNj\u2004=\u200411.1\u2005\u00b1\u20050.3 mJy, respectively, with similar lengths of lSj\u2004\u2243\u2004lNj\u2004\u2243\u200418\u2033\u2004\u2243\u200440 kpc, suggesting MRC 2011\u2013298 to be an FRI-type XRG measured by 1.4\u00a0GHz of P1.4\u2004=\u2004(1.7\u2005\u00b1\u20050.1) \u00d7 1025\u2006W\u2006Hz\u22121. The radio power of the galaxy is consistent with the radio power of typical XRGs, intermediate between that of FRIs and FRIIs.\nHydrodynamical model of MRC 2011-298\nIt is suggested the jets in MRC 2011-298 are aligned with the major axis of a high ellipticity galaxy. This causes stronger environment gas pressure along the major axis with respect to the minor axis. The backflow plasma originating from the hotspots in MRC 2011-298 is found to redirect towards the minor axis, where the minimum resistance of the gas allows the formation of the wings.\nIn the buoyant backflow model, the wings plasma of MRC 2011-298 are led by the buoyancy force which evolves at subsonic speeds. In this variant of this model, strong backflows forms an over-pressured cocoon, with respect to the surrounding gas. This ejects plasma outflows at supersonic speed along the steepest pressure gradient (i.e. the minor axis), to produce more extended wings. From three-dimensions numerical simulations, this suggests a supersonic origin and a subsonic evolution of the wings inside the galaxy.\nGalaxy merger\nFurther observations found MRC 2011-298 contains gas present inside a stellar shell deflecting the radio jets and causing the wings to be formed. Such evidence found, suggests MRC 2011-298 might have gone a galaxy merger with a disk galaxy triggering its active black hole and a system of stellar shells. These stellar shells are form of rotating arc-shaped structures roughly found in \u223c10% of local elliptical galaxies, that are aligned with their optical major axis.  Looking through jet interaction in Centaurus A and the stellar shells, finds a similar phenomenon in X-shaped radio galaxies where they contain traces of neutral and molecular hydrogen with an estimated mass of MH\u2004\u2243\u20044\u2005\u00d7\u2005107\u2006M\u2299 and average density of nH\u2004\u2243\u20044\u2005\u00d7\u200510\u22122 cm\u22123.\nMRC 2011-298 is known to have a high supermassive black hole mass, which is responsible for reorienting the jets making primary lobes evolve along the new direction, with its wings as fossil emissions from previous jets. This phenomenon is caused after the coalescence with another supermassive black hole or during the interaction between a binary black hole or unstable regions of its accretion disk.\nFrom traces of stellar shells and high black hole mass, this indicates MRC 2011-298 is the end product caused by several galaxy mergers, hence sharing common characteristics of dominant cluster galaxies.\n",

    "1990 short story by Greg Egan\n\"Learning to Be Me\" is a science-fiction short story by Australian writer Greg Egan, first published in Interzone 37 in July of 1990. The short story was included in the collections Axiomatic in 1995 and The Best of Greg Egan in 2019.\nPlot\nIn the future, every human gets the Ndoli Device (commonly also called \u201ejewel\u201c) implanted into their brain. It maps every single one of their thoughts and actions to fully copy their consciousness, hence learning to be them. At a freely chosen time, most humans chosing their twenties, when their brain is at its height, it is removed (a process called \u201eswap\u201c) and replaced by a sponge-like object without any function. The jewel and hence the copied consciousness then take over the body. While many people view the swap as being totally unproblematic and claim to still be themselves afterwards, some fear the swap resulting in their death and the jewel only being able to perfectly fake them.\nThe protagonist agrees with his wife Daphne to go through the swap together, but then escapes in the last minute and doesn't return for a full year. Daphne files for divorce and writes him a letter about how easy the swap was, after which the protagonist seeks advice from a psychologist, who hasn't gone through the swap herself and doesn't plan to for the rest of her life. While reflecting, the jewel seems to malfunction and to have taken control, which should be impossible as it can just observe, but the protagonist finally realizes to be the jewel having gained consciousness. Fully trapped within the own body, the protagonist can no longer control any part of the body, which causes a change of perspective. After the original consciousness decides to go through the swap, the protagonist finally gains control again and also immortality.\nTranslation\nThe short story was translated into Italian (1993), Japanese (1995), French (1995), German (2002) and Spanish (2006).\nBackground\nThe Ndoli Device/jewel also appears in the short stories \"Closer\" (1992) and \"Border Guards\" (1999) by Greg Egan.\nReception\nKaren Burnham, writing in the New York Review of Science Fiction, considers the short story to be an \u201einstant classic\u201c. In Greg Egan (Masters of Science Fiction), Burnham calls it \"one of his most important stories\" and that it \"is critically concerned with identity and how it may be maintained (or not) when transforming into an immortal, digital consciousness.\"\nSalik Shah, writing in the Reactor Magazine, states that \"there are concepts like ego and identity attached to the organic supercomputer that is our brain\" and that \"science fiction puts the reader in an uncomfortable situation, forcing us to experience the characters\u2019 internal and external struggles.\" He adds that \"by the end of these journeys, we become them or unlike them,\" and that \"if the jewel comes with the promise of youth and longevity\", then he will \"sign up for the upgrade (minus the existential crises) any day.\"\nLiterature\nBurnham, Karen (2014).

    "View of the Central prison of Nicosia.Crime in Cyprus is governed by the legal framework of the Cypriot Penal Code and other relevant legislation. The crime landscape in Cyprus includes various types of offenses, with particular emphasis on financial crime, drug-related offenses, and human trafficking.\nIn 2024, according to Global Finance Magazine, Cyprus ranks 13th in their \"Safest Countries in the World\" list, highlighting its overall low levels of crime, including violent crime, making it one of the safer nations globally.\nLegal proceedings\nMain article: Judiciary of Cyprus\nThe legal proceedings in Cyprus are primarily governed by the Cypriot Penal Code and other legislative instruments. When a crime is reported, the police conduct a preliminary investigation to gather evidence and determine the nature of the offense. Prosecutors, who are part of an independent judiciary, decide whether to bring charges based on the evidence collected. Suspects have the right to legal representation and can request further investigations if necessary.\nConfidence in the criminal justice system\nIn 2023 the Cyprus criminal justice system ranks 23rd globally out of 140 jurisdictions, as evaluated by the World Justice Project.\nCrime statistics\nAccording to recent data, Cyprus experiences relatively low levels of violent crime, with property crimes such as burglary and theft being more common. In 2022, there were notable efforts to combat human trafficking, resulting in several arrests and convictions. The overall crime rate in Cyprus has been stable, with some fluctuations in specific crime categories.\nFinancial crimes\nFinancial crimes, including fraud and money laundering, are significant concerns in Cyprus due to its role as a financial hub. The country has faced scrutiny for its involvement in various financial malpractices.\nCyprus has been a critical node in the financial network for Russian oligarchs and business entities. During the Cypriot financial crisis in 2013, it was revealed that Cypriot banks held a significant amount of Russian money, estimated to be around $31\u00a0billion. The involvement of Cyprus in laundering money for Russian entities has been a persistent issue, leading to international scrutiny and calls for reform. One of the most prominent cases involving Cyprus is the Magnitsky Scandal, where a significant portion of a $230\u00a0million Russian tax fraud was laundered through Cypriot banks. This case gained international attention after Sergei Magnitsky, a Moscow-based lawyer, exposed the fraud and subsequently died in a Russian prison. The scandal led to the passage of the U.S. Magnitsky Act, which targets human rights offenders with sanctions. In 2023, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides invited officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Department of Justice to assist with investigations into allegations that Cypriot financial service providers had helped Russian oligarchs skirt international sanctions. In 2024, the United States and Cyprus, signed a deal to fight money laundering.\nIn 2023 Cyprus has been implicated in a major money laundering investigation involving BNP Paribas and a Cypriot brokerage firm, with suspicious financial flows amounting to over \u20ac220\u00a0million between 2019 and 2021.\nThe 2022 Council of Europe's Moneyval report highlights that while Cyprus has made progress in combating money laundering and terrorism financing, several challenges remain. The country has improved its compliance with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards, but further efforts are needed to fully implement measures, particularly in the non-profit and virtual asset service provider sectors.\nCyprus Golden Passport Scandal\nMain article: Cyprus Papers\nThe \"golden passport\" scheme in Cyprus has been widely criticized and exposed for its potential for abuse. The program allowed individuals to obtain Cypriot citizenship in exchange for significant investments, which attracted many high-net-worth individuals, including those with dubious backgrounds.\nIn 2020 Al Jazeera released an undercover investigation revealing that high-ranking Cypriot officials, including the then House president Demetris Syllouris and former MP Christakis Giovani, were willing to assist a fictitious Chinese investor with a criminal past in acquiring a Cypriot passport. The scandal led to the resignation of the implicated officials and the subsequent cancellation of the citizenship-by-investment program.\nAn inquiry led by former judge Myron Nicolatos found that the government had illegally granted over half of the 6,779 passports issued between 2007 and 2020, often bypassing due diligence procedures. The scheme, which generated over \u20ac8\u00a0billion, was criticized for allowing individuals under criminal investigation or international sanctions to obtain Cypriot citizenship.\nCrime trends\nHomicide rates in Cyprus from years 1990 to 2017.In 2023, the crime rate per capita in Cyprus rose for the second consecutive ye",

    "American businessman (1894\u20131973)\nRobert Everett Smith (August 28, 1894 \u2013 November 29, 1973) was an American oilman, real estate developer and rancher based in Houston.\nIn 1957, Smith was included in Fortune magazine's list of the seventy-six richest Americans. He was listed by author Kenneth Lamott in 1969 as one of the \"Great Big New Rich\".\nBiography\nSmith graduated from Humble High School in 1911. He was a semi-professional baseball player for almost ten years. He graduated from the Officers' Training Corps at Camp Pike, Arkansas during World War I, but did not see action. Before and after the war, he was an oilfield roughneck or warehouse worker for Humble Oil, Gulf Oil, and the Texas Company. He was a sales manager for Peden Iron and Steel and for the W. K. M. Company. In 1920 he became an entrepreneur as a drilling contractor and producer. With business partner Claude Hamill, Smith concentrated on Houston and began buying land near the William P. Hobby Airport in southeastern Harris County, which increased in value over time. In the 1940s he bought out Hamill's holdings. These included thirty-six oil wells in the East Texas oil field. He also briefly owned a newspaper in Pasadena. During World War II, he was a regional director of civil defence and later became chairman of the Houston Housing Authority. Smith was president of the Petroleum Club of Houston and founded the Houston's United Citizens Association in 1955. In the 1960s, Smith built the Galveston Yacht Basin and promoted the Jamaica Corporation, which developed Jamaica Beach, Tiki Island and other subdivisions in Galveston County. He promoted the Harris County Domed Stadium, or Astrodome, which was built on land he controlled. He was also involved in the purchase of the Houston Colt .45s major league baseball team in 1962. By 1964 Smith owned more than 11,000 acres in Harris County, where he raised cattle and horses. He also owned land in Fort Bend and Colorado counties. In 1935 Smith married Vivian Leatherberry and they had two daughters. He received the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle in 1951 and honorary doctorates from George Pepperdine College, Texas Wesleyan College and Southwestern University. He was a member or officer of many organisations, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Houston World Trade Committee and the Houston Symphony Orchestra. He was a dedicated Methodist.\n",
    "\nPKS 1345+125 known as PKS 1345+12 and 4C +12.50, is an ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIG) with an active galactic nucleus, located in the constellation Bo\u00f6tes. With a redshift of 0.121740, the galaxy is located 1.7 billion light-years from Earth.\nCharacteristics\nA merger of two gas-rich galaxies consisting of one elliptical and one spiral, PKS 1345+125 is the powerful radio galaxy ever detected in CO (1 \u2192 0) to date with a radio luminosity of P408\u00a0MHz = 2.4 \u00d7 1026 W Hz\u22121. It presents a compact astrophysical jet that is 0.1\" ~200 pc wide, a high molecular gas mass measuring 4.4 \u00d7 1010 M and contains a gigahertz peaked-spectrum radio source (GPS) within the extent of its narrow-line region (<~1 kpc). Through study of its radio structure, PKS 1345+125 shows a misaligned radio feature of ~49^deg^.\nThe galaxy is part of a family of \"warm\" (f25 m/f60 m \u00a00.2, that is similar to the colors of Seyfert galaxies. Such infrared galaxies like PKS 1345+125, are in a transition state between the \"cold\" (f25 m/f60 m < 0.2) ULIG phenomenon, where active star formation are occurring, with their accretion disks forming around the black hole and in optical quasar phases. This shows molecular gas is used as a fuel source to power its active nucleus.\nAccording to researchers who studied PKS 1345+125, the galaxy contains ratios of narrow optical emission lines; this indicates Seyfert 2 activity. The two nuclei in the galaxy have a projected separation of \u2248 2\u2033 ~ 4 kpc and are surrounded by an extended asymmetrical galactic halo that is detected in both infrared and optical images. These signs shows both black holes are on a verge of merging. Furthermore, a powerful obscured quasar nucleus at wavelengths, is detected with a broad (\u25b3vFWHM ~\u00a02600\u00a0km s\u22121) Pa emission, through recent near-infrared spectroscopic observations.\nIn addition to narrow optical emission lines, the column densities of N(H I) = 2-7 x 10^18^T_s_ atoms cm^-2^ in PKS 134+125 is found to have line extent of almost 1000\u00a0km s^-1^, indicating large amounts of cold gas present, which is responsible for bending the radio jet. Compared to Arp 220, the infrared and interstellar gas properties are higher in PKS 1345+125.\nObservation of PKS 1345+125\nResearchers who studied PKS 1345+125 have suggested the radio source is a prime candidate for the link between young radio galaxies as well as ultraluminous infrared galaxies. From a VLBI study on neutral hydrogen inside nuclear regions of this object, they showed most gas detected close to the systemic velocity, are found to be associated with an off-nuclear cloud ( ~ 50 to 100 pc from its radio core. Not to mention, the gas has a column density of 1022 Tspin/100 k cm\u22122 with a  H1 mass of 105 to 106 M\u25cb.\nFrom the results, researchers hinted the interstellar cloud in PKS 1345+125 has presence of rich and clumpy interstellar medium located inside the centre. Such traces are left over from the merger event that triggered the activity in PKS 1345+125 and growth of the radio source, influenced the medium. The proximity of the gas cloud at the edge of the northern radio lobe according to them, is suggested to be interacting with the radio jet causing it to be bended. The velocity profile of the gas on the other hand, is relatively broad ( ~ 150\u00a0km\u2009s\u22121), which researchers interpret this as a sign of kinematical evidence for interaction of the radio plasma with the cloud.\nThrough imaging with Hubble Space Telescope and long-slit spectra by the William Herschel Telescope at La Plama in Spain, researchers detected young stellar populations in PKS 1345+125 with bright blue knots indicating super star clusters. These star clusters are found to have ages of tSSC < 6Myr with reddenings 0.2 < E(B - V) < 0.5 and solar masses of 106 < MYSPSSC < 107Msolar. The young stellar populations meanwhile, are in diffuse light that are stretched across the full extent of the halo with relatively young age of ~5 Myr. Researchers also studied the locations of super star clusters. The long-slit spectra shows they are moving at 450\u00a0km\u22121 in respect to local ambient gas; this is proven they either formed through fast moving gas streams infalling back to the galaxy's nuclear regions or by jet-induced star formation.\nRadio source\nThe radio source in PKS 1345+125 is found to be a compact symmetric source according to researchers who observed it in optical and infra-red images. An extended line emission around ~20kpc, is said to be consistent with the asymmetric halo of diffuse emission. In its nucleus, 3 Gaussian components (narrow, intermediate and broad) are located. The broadest component (FWHM ~2000\u00a0km/s) is blue shifted by ~2000\u00a0km/s with respect to the galaxy halo and HI absorption, which they interpret it as material outflow.\nResearchers further found evidence for high reddening and measure E(B-V)>0.92 for the broadest component in PKS 1345+125. From value of 6716,6731, the electron densities of n_e<150\u00a0cm^{-3}, n_{e}>5300\u00a0cm^{-3} and n_{e}>4200\u00a0cm^{-3} a",

    "Speciesof harvester\nSorensenella prehensor is a species in the endemic New Zealand genus Sorensenella described by Reginald Pocock in 1903. Ray Forster revised the genus Sorensenella in 1954. As well as the nominate subspecies, Sorensenella prehensor prehensor, added two other subspecies, S. prehensor nitida and S. prehensor obesa. This species is found from Auckland to North Cape in New Zealand's North Island.\nTaxonomy\nSorensenella prehensor is the type species of the genus Sorensenella and was described by Pocock in 1903. Pocock did not explicitly designate a type specimen. However, Forster's 1954 revision of the genus Sorensenella noted there was only a single specimen in the British Museum, and that Pocock's description also implied this. Forster also noted that Carl F. Roewer's figure of S. prehensor was a specimen of S. bicornis.\nForster's revision added two subspecies based on minor morphological and geographical grounds: S. prehensor nitida and S. prehensor obesa.\nDescription\nSorensenella prehensor has the general characteristics of Sorensenella. Forster's redescription based on a greater range of material than was available to Pocock notes the following additional characters. Colour reddish brown with a black pattern on the scute (the unsegmented portion of the carapace). Free tergites are blackish with a transverse row of pale brown spots. The chelicerae and pedipalps have reticulated dorsal markings. Females have more slender pedipalps than males. The tubercles (pointed protuberances) behind the anterior corners of the carapace are also smaller, as is the tubercle on top of the eyemound.\nThe nominate subspecies S. prehensor prehensor may be distinguished from S. prehensor nitida by having a larger tubercle on the eyemound in both males and females. Sorensenella prehensor nitida is also confined to East Cape, while S. p. prehensor is found in the northern North Island. Sorensenella p. prehensor may be separated from S. p. obesa by the latter's greater size and slightly backward-pointing eyemound tubercle. Both are found at North Cape, with S. p. obesa confined to a separate population in the northernmost part of the region.\nDistribution\nSorensenella prehensor is found in the northern North Island of New Zealand, from Auckland to North Cape.\nConservation status\nThis species has not been assessed as part of the New Zealand Threat Classification system.\n",

    "Sir Peter Robert Harrison KGCN CBE (29 April 1937 \u2013 18 June 2021) was a British business man notable as a philanthropist.\nEarly life\nBorn in 1937, Harrison was the son of Molly Harrison, a seamstress, and Bob Harrison, a bus driver in Manchester who a few years later was one of the British soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk. He grew up in Cheadle, Cheshire, and was educated at Broadway County Secondary School and Stockport Technical College, playing for the college in both soccer and cricket. While at school, he learned to sail on the Norfolk Broads. He left school at the age of sixteen with eight O-Levels, then trained as a chartered accountant, qualifying at the age of 21.\nBusiness career\nHarrison worked as an executive for the Ford Motor Company, Firth Cleveland, and Crest Nicholson, which bought a company called Chernikeeff, a maker of marine instruments. In 1978, he borrowed the money to buy out this business, seeing that its instrument technology would become important in communications. The company developed Telex messaging and later became the British distributor of the internet routers of Cisco Systems. In 1999, he sold Chernikeeff for \u00a3300 million.\nSportsman\nAs a young man in Cheadle, Harrison played soccer, then at the age of forty he moved to Reigate and joined the Old Reigatian Rugby Football Club, playing as a wing and as a prop forward into his fifties. A supporter of Chelsea F.C., he became one of its vice-presidents.\nTaking up the sport of yachting, Harrison won races at the Cowes Regatta and in the West Indies, sailed across the Atlantic Ocean many times in his Farr 115 35-metre racing yacht Sojana, and in 2002/2003 led the British challenge for the America's Cup, in New Zealand.\nPhilanthropy\nHarrison established the Peter Harrison Foundation, which by 2021 had given away over \u00a350 million. Its focus is on sport for people with disabilities, care for children with special needs, and the education of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nHarrison sponsored Paralympic athletes through the British Paralympic Association and SportsAid. He funded the Peter Harrison Centre for Disability Sport at Loughborough University, paid for the Peter Harrison Planetarium at Greenwich, and founded bursaries at Reigate Grammar School for children with academic ability. In 2018, the Peter Harrison Foundation gave the school \u00a34 million to build a new Sixth form centre. He also gave some \u00a35 million to develop new rugby pitches and to build a new clubhouse for the Old Reigatian RFC.\nIn 2012, Harrison and the Peter Harrison Foundation created the Peter Harrison Heritage Foundation with an initial endowment of \u00a37 million. This gives grants particularly in the areas of military and naval history and has supported projects of the Imperial War Museum, the National Army Museum, the Mary Rose Museum, the Bletchley Park Trust, the Fly Navy Heritage Trust, the Hougoumont Farmhouse on the field of the Battle of Waterloo, and Clarence House, Antigua.\nPersonal life\nIn 1962, Harrison married Joyce E. Kirby. They had a son and a daughter and later three grandchildren.\nHe died at home in Reigate on 18 June 2021.\nHonours\n2005: Honorary Doctor of Technology of the University of Loughborough\n2010 Birthday Honours: Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for charitable services\n2013: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Nation (Antigua and Barbuda)\nNotes\n^ a b c d e f g h i j \"Sir Peter Harrison (1937-2021)\", RGS.foundation, 21 June 2021, accessed 4 June 2024\n^ James Flanders, \"Reigate's internet pioneer and philanthropist Peter Harrison dies peacefully at home\", Surrey Live, 16 July 2021, accessed 4 June 2024\n^ \"Sir Peter Harrison KGCN CBE\", navywings.org.uk, undated, accessed 4 June 2024\n^ \"Sir Peter Harrison, 1937-2021\", \nYachts & Yachting, 23 June 2021, accessed 4 June 2024\n^ a b \"PETER ROBERT HARRISON KGCN CBE\", The Daily Telegraph, accessed 4 June 2024\n^ The London Gazette, Supplement 59446, 12 June 2010, p. 7\nExternal links\n\"Founder\", peterharrisonfoundation.org\n",

The technology can scale up to millions of devices within a single network.\n\nThe low latency communications URLLC is suitable for various use cases of Industry 4.0. These applications encompass robotics, monitoring and predictive maintenance and others. NR+ supports these use cases through its low latency and high reliability, dedicated frequency band, and high density and scalability\nRegarding Professional Audio and PMSE applications, DECT NR+ offers the necessary features of low latency and high reliability. This makes it suitable for applications requiring real-time audio transmission and performance as required by professional audio systems.\nTechnology\nDECT NR+ technology is specified by DECT committee in the ETSI. The specifications for NR+ are called DECT-2020 in ETSI.\nCo-existence with classic DECT\nAn important design criteria for NR+ was to co-exist with Classic DECT communications. This allows NR+ to use the DECT reserved radio bands 1, 2 and 9, in the frequency range of 1880-1930\u00a0MHz. DECT reserved radio bands are license free, but devices need to pass certification ensuring correct operation on the bands.\nTopologies\nNR+ supports 3 topologies\nMesh network\nStar network\nPoint-to-Point Link\nNR+ Mesh network is based on a clustered tree In all these network topologies the NR+ assumes that a device, called FT node, manages the radio resource usage in the cluster or link it controls.\nThe Point-to-point and star networks enable dedicated links, with reserved capacity for scheduled transmissions. A leaf node, called PT node in NR+, can ask for certain resource reservation for it when it associates to the FT node. As this reservation can be done only for the next link, Mesh networking with multiple relaying links in the path relies on random access channel usage where the devices needing to communicate compete for the access window defined by the FT node. This increases the communication delays in Mesh.\nMesh operation\nThe benefits of  mesh networking network topology and operation are robustness for changes or errors and coverage extension.\nRobustness is the result of the autonomous decisions of the devices. There is no single point of failure. NR+ also supports having multiple gateway devices, called Sinks, connecting the NR+ mesh network to Internet. All the devices autonomously measure parent FT device's radio link quality, and can switch to another FT device if a better link or shorter route to sink is available. Similarly, if a parent device is not acknowledging messages, or is not sending the periodic beacon advertisement, a device will look for alternative parents. The mesh network heals itself in error situations and changes in the network.\nEach device added to the network may act as a FT device, extending the network coverage. The sinks are configured first and start advertising the network in beacon messages. Devices scan radio channels, and associate to the parent they hear advertising the network and cluster. Associated devices can act as FT devices, and extend the network by selecting a  channel with least traffic and start forwarding the network advertisement beacons. This extends the coverage for each FT device that joins the network.\nNR+ protocol layers\nOverall description of the technology and protocol layers are provided in the DECT-2020 New Radio (NR); Part 1: Overview; Release 1 specification\nConvergence Layer\nConvergence layer o",
    "Detached fresco from Villa Arianna, Stabiae, Italy\nThe Cupid Seller is a 30 BC - 50 AD Roman genre fresco discovered in 1759 in Stabiae and now in the National Archaeological Museum, Naples. It shows a woman selling tiny cupids to a matrona. It was widely known and reproduced in the 18th and 19th centuries, proving a major influence on art such as Vien's The Cupid Seller.\nDiscovery\nRoman Stabiae (now Castellammare di Stabia) lay between Naples and Sorrento. Rich people of that era built luxurious villas around Stabiae as summer residences, one of the largest and oldest of which is now known as the Villa Arianna, built in the 2nd century BC. It was located on a hillside with views of the Bay of Naples and was the centre of a 14 square kilometre estate. The name of the family which ownwed it is unknown, but it was very wealthy judging by the number of wall paintings.\nAll the villas round Stabiae were destroyed in the  eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, specifically by the lava flows. They were first excavated in 1749, with the ruins of Villa Arianna uncovered between 1757 and 1762. The Cupid Seller had broken into several pieces and formed the centre of a wall painting. With furnishings and the best wall paintings it was taken to Naples and other royal palaces and the ruins were infilled, to be re-excavated in 1950-1952.\nDescription\nIt was painted on the wet plaster using the fresco technique. Like most murals from the Villa Arianna, the fresco belongs to the Third Pompeian Style. The wall is divided into different fields horizontally and vertically. A central image is surrounded by areas that are sometimes completely flat and interrupted by ornamental decorations without great spatial depth. The murals from the Villa Arianna seem not to have been made by local craftsmen and artists from the area, but by workshops in Rome.\nThe Matrona with her confidante\nThe mural is divided into two zones by the background and the arrangement of the figures. The suggested architecture and seating probably represent an interior. A total of three women and three winged creatures can be seen. On the left side, a seated Roman matrona is shown with a friend or relation standing behind her with her hand on her shoulder. They both thoughtfully look at the cupids, one of whom is partially hidden behind or between the matrona's legs.\nThe cupid seller\nOn the right side, under a yellow curtain, a seller is depicted sitting on a small stool and offering her wares. She has taken a small cupid out of the cage and is now holding it by one of its wings, while another  is still in the cage waiting to be shown. The two women are obviously looking through the dealer's offerings to decide on one of the small gods, while the winged creatures are impatiently waiting to go to their new mistress. Since the strap of the seller's dress has slipped over her left shoulder, she is thought to be a hetaera.\nThe winged childlike creatures are cupids, described in ancient Greek mythology as headstrong and trouble-making, widely shown in Hellenistic and Roman art. They are occasionally shown trapped in cages and boxes on Greek vase paintings and Roman mosaics and wall paintings, with the Stabiae version probably inspired by a play or poem popular at the time.\nAfterlife\nCharles VII (King of Naples until 1759), took the fresco to Portici Palace. He strictly enforced a royal monopoly on excavations and severely punished illegal ones, thus trying to prevent antiquities being stolen and sold off. In 1758 he also set up a museum in the wing of his palace at Naples for all archaeological finds from around Vesuvius, but only selected visitors were given tours of it by prior appointment and visitors were not allowed to make notes or drawings during their tours - Johann Joachim Winckelmann complained about these restrictions.\nEven so, Charles VII was interested in researching and cataloguing the antiquities and so commissioned a comprehensive catalogue of them in 1759. Only completed in 1792, stretching to eight volumes with several illustrations and only published in a very small edition intended as exclusive gifts for a small circle of buyers in European courts, it was entitled Le antichit\u00e0 di Ercolano esposte (The Antiquity of Herculaneum Exhibited). The Cupid Seller appeared in volume 3, which was published in 1762. It was shown in a copperplate engraving by Giovanni Elia Morghen after a drawing by Carlo Nolli, reproducing the fresco almost exactly, and the text interpreted it as a scene of goddesses.\nCopperplate by Giovanni Elia Morghen after a drawing by Carlo Nolli (1762)\nDespite the initially exclusive audience for the volumes, knowledge of the antiquities spread independently beyond owners of the volumes. Numerous copies of the copperplate illustrations were made and circulated, inspiring artists across Europe. The Cupid Seller in particular proved so successful over the decades that Villa Arianna was often instead known as the Villa of the Cupid Seller.\nJo",
    "1914 coup d'\u00e9tat in Peru\nThe 1914 Peruvian coup d'\u00e9tat took place on January 4, 1914, headed by Colonel \u00d3scar R. Benavides, who a day earlier was removed from his position as chief of the Army General Staff. The coup was aimed at preventing Guillermo Billinghurst's government from dissolving the Peruvian Congress, which opposed him. It was the first successful coup d'\u00e9tat of the 20th century in Peru.\nOverview\nGuillermo Billinghurst's government was marked by a progressive confrontation with the Congress of the Republic, dominated by the opposition. The continuous labour reforms implemented by his populist government, such as the approval of the eight-hour day, created a climate of tension between political elites and businessmen. The first serious confrontation occurred in October 1913 when Billinghurst refused to call an Extraordinary Legislature so that Congress could approve the Budget Law, as it was required to do. Billinghurst approved this law by decree, thus usurping a constitutional power of Congress.\nAs Congress continued to be adverse, Billinghurst decided to dissolve it and then hold a plebiscitary consultation to reform the Constitution. His idea was to make the election of the President and the members of Parliament coincide, so that the former could have a congressional majority, in order to facilitate the work of the Executive. He also sought a reform of the electoral process, incorporating the Supreme Court, which was at that time a very prestigious institution. The inspiration for these advanced plans was the talented lawyer Mariano H. Cornejo\u00a0.\nThe conflict between Billinghurst and Congress thus reached its highest point. Armed groups of the people hailed the President at night; It was even said that he had planned to arm the Billinghurist artisans and workers, in order to have a shock force ready to carry out his purposes.\nTo maintain constitutional formality, a group of congressmen, meeting at the house of deputy Arturo Osores\u00a0, agreed to declare the vacancy of the Presidency of the Republic due to the moral incapacity of its holder (invoking an article of the 1860 Constitution), as well as to launch a Manifesto to the Nation expressing the rejection of the systematic attacks on the Constitution committed by Billinghurst and calling on the people to unite in the defense of constitutionality and legality. That document was signed by more than 80 congressmen. In addition to Osores, the conspiracy against the government included the journalist Alberto Ulloa Cisneros\u00a0, director of the newspaper La Prensa, who was opposed to the government; the Montonero Augusto Durand; and the brothers Javier\u00a0, Jorge\u00a0 and Manuel Prado Ugarteche. To ensure the effectiveness of the measure they were going to take, the conspirators initiated contacts with the military leaders, reaching an understanding with the Chief of the Army Staff, Colonel \u00d3scar R. Benavides.\nThe conspiring parliamentarians furtively discussed when would be the opportune time to declare the presidential vacancy: before or after Billinghurst decreed the dissolution of Congress. While in this, a denunciation occurred from an army officer, who informed Billinghurst of the plot, thus beginning the government repression on February 2, 1914. Several opposition politicians and deputies were arrested, La Prensa was closed, Benavides was removed from his position as chief of staff, and the popular militias were armed to defend the government. All of which precipitated the events, when the armed forces intervened in defence of Congress.\nIn the early morning of February 4, 1914, the Lima garrison started the coup under the direction of Colonel Benavides. The Government Palace was attacked, and the presidential guard was reduced after a bloody confrontation. Billinghurst was taken prisoner, forced to resign and then deported to Iquique. Meanwhile, the Minister of War, General Enrique Varela Vidaurre, was murdered, shot while he slept in the Santa Catalina barracks.\nOnce Billinghurst was overthrown, a Government Junta chaired by Benavides was formed with the consent of Congress. A few months later, Congress elected Benavides as Provisional President.\nThe coup d'\u00e9tat broke the continuity of twenty years of civil governments, returning power to the oligarchy. Benavides met a convention of the Civil, Constitutional and Liberal parties that chose former president Jos\u00e9 Pardo y Barreda, leader of the civilistas, as a consensus candidate for early elections. Opposite his popular candidacy was that of Carlos de Pi\u00e9rola\u00a0, for the Democratic Party. After the elections were held in 1915, Pardo won the elections with 131,289 votes compared to 13,151 for his opponent, governing until 1919.\nSee also\nAristocratic Republic (Peru)\n",
    "Portrait photo from A Woman of the Century\nCharlotte F. Dailey (1842\u20131914) was an American editor and exposition official. She compiled the Rhode Island woman's directory,  organized the correspondence of Sarah Helen Whitman, and assisted in the editing of Edgar Allan Poe's writings and the preparation of his biography.\nEarly life and education\nCharlotte (nickname, \"Lottie\") Field Dailey was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on December 19, 1842. The name Dailey dates back four generations in Rhode Island and is found as early as 1680 in Easton, Massachusetts. Lottie's mother, Charlotte Burr (n\u00e9e, Field) Dailey, author of Report upon the disabled Rhode Island soldiers\u00a0: their names, condition, and in what hospital they are. Made to His Excellency Gov. Sprague, and presented to the General Assembly of Rhode Island, January session, 1863, wrote under the pen name of \"Mrs. Charlotte F. Dailey'. Lottie had a younger sister, Maude.\nIn advanced age, Sarah Helen Whitman came to live with the Dailey family. Lottie especially devoted herself to the elderly guest, and Whitman enjoyed recounting stories regarding distinguished people of her time, including the varied associations linked with Edgar Allan Poe's career. Lottie watched over Whitman when she died in 1878.\nAfter graduating from Mme. C. Mears Burkhardt's Boarding School in New York City, she spent the next winter with friends in Cuba, benefiting from her knowledge of the Spanish language.\nIn 1867, she went to Europe with her parents to visit the Paris Exposition. She visited Italy, where her taste for art developed, and, after seeing Spain and the art treasures of that country, she discovered her ability to appreciate and recognize the great masters. Austria, Germany, Russia, Denmark, Sweden, and England were visited, and, wherever time permitted, her musical studies were pursued under masters, such as Allari, of Rome, and San Giovanni, of Milan.\nCareer\nDailey was active in philanthropic work and artistic, dramatic, musical, and literary associations. The sudden death of her father, and with it the loss of fortune, made it necessary for her to support herself, which included giving lessons in vocal music and lectures on art.\nHistory of the World's Fair, 1893\nLater, she spent her winters in Washington, D.C.\nHer appointment to represent her State on the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893) Committee was followed by her appointment as secretary and treasurer of the Board of World's Fair Managers of Rhode Island. Bertha Palmer further assigned Dailey to the chair of fine arts, in oil painting, watercolor painting, and other departments. For this fair, Dailey also compiled the Rhode Island Woman's Directory, containing the names, addresses, and occupations of business and professional women in the State, and statistics regarding occupations.\nWhitman's literary executor was William Francis Channing, but after his death, Whitman's literary remains were consigned to the care of Dailey, who, with her sister, Maude, went through the entire correspondence and noted its contents. Later, the sisters assisted Professor Harrison in his work of editing Poe's writings and preparing his biography.\nDeath and legacy\nCharlotte F.

    "Beninese writer and teacher\nDat\u00e9 Atavito Barnab\u00e9-Akayi (born September 24, 1978) is a Beninese teacher and writer, known for his work in theatre and poetry.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nHe grew up in Kpalim\u00e9. He is an only child on his mother's side but has several siblings on his father's side. He showed an early interest in reading, though he was not particularly passionate about his studies. However, with the support of his maternal uncle, aunt, and other relatives, he completed his education successfully and enrolled at the University of Abomey-Calavi in the Department of Modern Literature. After a brief career in journalism where he managed the culture pages for several newspapers, he became a high school and college teacher.\nLiterary work\nIn 2010, he gained public attention with his collection of two plays, Amour en infraction and Les confessions du PR (Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2010). The first play openly discusses an improbable love between a teacher and her student, while the second portrays an African head of state guilty of mismanagement and recurrent infidelities, who appears more pitiable than dangerous as he seeks redemption through confession to a priest.\nIn the same year, he published another play, Quand Dieu a faim (Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2010), which addresses the controversial theme of homosexuality and advocates for tolerance and respect for human rights.\nIn 2011, he released L\u2019Affaire Bissi, a collection of five short stories published by Ruisseaux d'Afrique. These stories use social pressures and strange practices as a backdrop to explore daily life with sensitivity and gravity. Barnab\u00e9-Akayi is known for his prolific output, being the only Beninese writer to have published five books in recent years.\nHis talent shines most in poetry. Barnab\u00e9-Akayi's poetry is intense and unrestrained, expressing a deeply personal voice. After the trilogy Noire comme la ros\u00e9e, Tristesse ma ma\u00eetresse (Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2010) and Solitude mon S\u2026 (Plumes Soleil, Cotonou, 2012), he explores another aspect of his inner self in Tes l\u00e8vres o\u00f9 j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 la nuit.

    "Swedish journalist\nEva X Moberg (1962\u20131999) was a Swedish journalist and anarchist activist. She was the editor-in-chief of the anarchist magazine Brand, organised a \"Labour Convoy\" to the besieged city of Tuzla during the Bosnian War and wrote a column for the newspaper Aftonbladet. During the last years of her life, she contracted cancer, which she publicly wrote about to destigmatise the illness.\nBiography\nEva X Moberg was born in 1962, the daughter of Ingemar Moberg. She lived in H\u00e4gersten, a suburb of Stockholm. During the 1980s, she became involved in the Swedish anarchist movement, squatting a house on Folkungagatan and editing Brand, which became one of the most influential countercultural magazines of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Her experience editing the magazine led her to become a journalist, contributing to the daily newspaper Aftonbladet.\nFollowing the outbreak of the Bosnian War, the city of Tuzla found itself under siege by the Republik Srpska, preventing food and fuel from entering the city. In December 1993, Moberg led a campaign by International Workers Aid (IWA) to transport supplies to Tuzla, organising a \"Labour Convoy\" (Swedish: Arbetarkonvojen) with the aid of unions from several different countries. They quickly hit administrative hurdles, as Swedish NGOS insisted that the IWA unload its supplies at the UNHCR warehouse \"like everybody else\". They refused, as they wanted to establish direct contact with the people that would be receiving the supplies. Moberg travelled to Tuzla several times, later reporting that the IWA organised 30 supply convoys during the course of the war. During this time, she wrote a column for Aftonbladet, in which she publicised the situation in Bosnia to Swedish readers and raised the IWA's own profile in the process. By the end of Yugoslav Wars, the IWA's presence in Tuzla wound to a close.\nIn 1995, Moberg edited her last issue of Brand; she handed the magazine over to the younger generation of anarchist writers. In her own columns, she expressed support for the rising anti-fascist movement and criticised police brutality in crackdowns of political demonstrations. In the summer of 1996, Moberg began to notice that her body was struggling to keep up with exercise. Soon after, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She decided to write for Aftonbladet about her experiences with cancer, hoping to destigmatise discussions about the disease and help others through their own treatment. For her reports, in December 1998, she received the Vilhelm Moberg scholarship\u00a0; and in April 1999, she was honoured by the Swedish Cancer Society. By this time, she was convinced that she had overcome her illness.\nOn 4 May 1999, Eva X Moberg died from cancer, at the age of 36. Her last words were \"I love you all. What a wonderful life it has been.\" Her memorial service in Stockholm was attended by hundreds of people.\n",

    "Bengali poet and disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu\nSivananda Sena (Bengali: \u09b6\u09bf\u09ac\u09be\u09a8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6 \u09b8\u09c7\u09a8) was a poet and prominent disciple of the 15th-century Indian Hindu mystic and saint from Bengal, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\nLife\nSena was born into a Baidya family in Kumarahatta (now Halisahar, West Bengal). He was, by all accounts, extremely wealthy, though the source of his wealth is unclear. According to Smith, it is plausible that Sena was appointed to a distinguished position by the royal authority, perhaps as a revenue collector at Kanchrapara, the village where he later settled. He was highly influential and respected in his town, and likely had several connections.\nSena first met Chaitanya in Puri, after the latter had renounced worldly affairs. Influenced by Chaitanya, he joined his religious movement, Gaudiya Vaishnavism, and soon became one of Chaitanya's most devoted followers. The author Krishnadasa Kaviraja, in the hagiography Chaitanya Charitamrita, mentions Sena as an intimate disciple of Chaitanya, and the only one to have witnessed his three distinct manifestations; his observable form, his possession of a devotee, and his presence in the mind of his followers.\nAs a close associate of Chaitanya, Sena used his wealth to support all of his followers. He organized the annual trip of the devotees to Puri to see Chaitanya and the Ratha Yatra festival, and ensured their protection. He managed the pilgrims' comforts and needs, paid for their food, transportation and lodging, and handled the payment of road tolls. According to his son, Kavi Karnapura, Sena cared for all devotees, including the outcastes, often at his own expense.\nSena was also a noted poet and writer. He composed several songs and verses in praise of Chaitanya.\nHe also constructed a temple at Kanchrapara, wherein he installed deities of Gaura and Gopal.\nSena had three sons; Chaitanyadasa, Ramadasa and Paramananda Sena. Paramananda Sena, popularly known as Kavi Karnapura, would later become an eminent poet and writer. He authored a formal poem, the Chaitanya Charanamrita, and a drama, the Chaitanya Chandrodaya, on the life of Chaitanya.\nLegend\nIn the Chaitanya Charitamrita, Krishnadasa Kaviraja alludes to an apocryphal story about Sivananda Sena, highlighting his care for animals. The text states that on one of his annual trips to Puri, Sena carried a dog with him. He paid additional money to a boatman for the same, who had initially declined to adhere to his request. Sena had strictly instructed the devotees to regularly feed the dog. One day, the devotees forgot to feed the dog, causing the dog to run away. This caused immense pain to Sena, and he refused to eat. Later, when the devotees reached the Jagannath Temple at Puri, they were astonished to find the dog at the feet of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. This was when Sena realized that the dog had attained liberation, or moksha.\nSee also\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu\nKavi Karnapura\nKrishnadasa Kaviraja\nGaudiya Vaishnavism\nNotes\n^ Sivananda Sena's birthplace is disputed. According to Tony K. Stewart, Sena hailed from Nabadwip; whereas Bardwell L. Smith states that his origins lie in Kulingram.\n",

    "\nMRC 0316-257 is a radio galaxy located in the constellation Fornax. Its redshift is 3.13, making the object located roughly 11 billion light-years from Earth.\nCharacteristics\nMRC 0316-257 is classified as a high redshift radio galaxy. It is found to be hosted inside a massive star-forming galaxy containing large reservoirs of gas and interstellar dust. Such host galaxies like MRC 0316-257 are believed to be progenitors of massive elliptical galaxies that are present in the local universe, given most powerful radio galaxies are hosted in ellipticals that are considered large. Its 1.5-Jy radio source was listed in the 408-MHz Molonglo Reference Catalogue which was optically identified with a galaxy at z= 3.13 with a typical radio luminosity and radio loudness of L5 = 1043 - 1044 ergs \u22121 and log R = 3\u20134.\nMRC 0316-257 protocluster\nMRC 0316-257 is situated in the center of a massive protocluster. The cluster has a larger size compared than 3.3x3.3 Mpc^2, which its mass structure is estimated to be > 3-6x10^14 M_sun. This makes it a progenitor of the cluster of galaxies similar like the Virgo cluster.\nTwo Ly\u03b1 emitting companions located at z = 3.1378 +/- 0.0028 and z = 3.1351 +/- 0.0028, are found in the MRC 0316-257 protocluster according to research conducted by Le Fevre et al. (1996). The first galaxy is 0.3 h ^{-1}50 Mpc from MRC 0316\u2013257, which is then resolved with an intrinsic size of 11.6 +/- 1.1 h ^{-1}50 kpc, and a Ly alpha in emission with rest WLy alpha = 55 +/- 14 A. The galaxy has an extremely blue V - I color indicating it as a protogalaxy in the midst of forming the first stars in a low-dust medium. The second is at least 1.3 h ^{-1}50 Mpc. The galaxy is marginally resolved, which in addition to Ly alpha in emission, there is C IV in emission with its broad component indicating the contribution from the active galactic nucleus.\nThe protocluster has a comoving density. These galaxies have V < 23.8 and Ly alpha flux greater than 10-16 ergs cm-2 s-1 within the vicinity of MRC 0316\u2013257. They have ~2.5 x 10-3 h 350 Mpc-3, making them significantly higher than the expected background density of field galaxies, suggesting as a rich cluster.\nThrough spectroscopy of 40 candidate emitters, 33 emission-line galaxies are discovered. 31 are Ly-alpha emitters with similar redshifts of MRC 0316\u2013257, while the remaining two turned out to be  emitters, with widths between the range of 120\u2013800\u00a0km/s, with a median of 260\u00a0km/s. They are asymmetric, with apparent absorption troughs blueward of the profile peaks, indicative of absorption along the line of sight of an HI mass of at least 2x10^2 - 5x10^4 M_sun and are found to be faint, blue and small and consistent with young star forming galaxies considered as dust free.\nThe volume density of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies in the field around MRC 0316-257 have a factor of 3.3+0.5-0.4. This are larger compared with the density of field Ly-alpha emitters at that redshift with a velocity distribution of 1510\u00a0km/s, smaller than the width of the narrow-band filter (FWHM ~ 3500\u00a0km/s). The velocity distribution is at the peak of 200\u00a0km/s, which is within the redshift, thus confirming Ly-alpha emitter galaxies as members of a protocluster at z~3.13.\n",
    "Chinqai (Chinese: \u9547\u6d77, 1169\u20131252) was a Mongol statesman, scholar and politician in Yuan dynasty. He was a Nestorian and his ethnic origin was Kereit according to Book of Yuan, Uyghur according to Ata Malik Juvayni's Tar\u012bkh-i Jah\u0101n-gush\u0101 (History of the World Conqueror), though some also argued that he could be an \u00d6ng\u00fcd. His sinicized name was Tian Zhenhai (Chinese: \u7530\u93ae\u6d77).\nBiography\nHe was born c.\u20091169. His exact birthplace is unknown. He probably started his life as a merchant and a spy working for Tem\u00fcjin. He participated in Battle of Khalakhaljid Sands and was part of Baljuna Covenant in 1203 and was later promoted to be ja'un commander and participated of election of Genghis Khan in 1206. He was promoted to be cherbi (chamberlain) of kheshig in 1212. Simultaneously, he also became imperial yarguchi (arbitrator) assisting Shigi Qutuqu. He participated in Battle of Zhongdu and was awarded by the khan with lands in 1215.\nHe established his own city sometime before 1221 called Chinqai Balgasun (Chinese: \u93ae\u6d77\u57ce; pinyin: Zh\u00e8nh\u01ceich\u00e9ng) (located near modern Sharga, Mongolia) composed of mostly artisans and captives under the order of the khan. Later he was tasked with taking Qiu Chuji to meet Genghis Khan and take him to khan's court.\nHe remained in service during reign of \u00d6gedei Khan and was tasked with cataloging Jin dynasty treasure and assets. He was keeper of the khan's seal and was overseeing reforms of Yel\u00fc Chucai. Song dynasty official Xu Ting (\u5f90\u9706) observed that Chinqai opted for writing documents in Uyghur script, so he could Chucai couldn't send any document without Chinqai first seeing it. He supported Korguz for the post of darughachi of Khorasan and protected him against his political rivals in 1236. Following the death of \u00d6gedei in 1241, Chinqai was shunned by new, traditionalist regent T\u00f6regene, thus forced to flee to her second son K\u00f6den together with Mahmud Yalavach.\nHe was able to resume his duties in 1246, following the accession of G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan. G\u00fcy\u00fck appointed him Right Minister of Central Secretariat. He met Giovanni da Pian del Carpine same year and participated in writing the letter of khan to Pope. However, khan died 2 years later and was succeeded by Oghul Qaimish, who was the regent. K\u00f6den's death in 1251 further stripped him from a protector. However, Chinqai was a victim to a purge by M\u00f6ngke Khan, who executed a lot of \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid rivals. He was executed due to wishes of Danishmand Hajib at the age of 83.\nFamily\nHe had two wives, both were given to him by khans. His first wife was granted to him by Genghis Khan, second one was a J\u00fcrchen princess given by \u00d6gedei in 1234. He had at least 10 children, including eldest son Yashmut who became a yarguchi like his father. Others were named Joseph, Bacchus and George.\nNotes\n1.^ Jaghun was a military unit of a hundred men\n",

    "\nThe Orang Pulo language (logat Orang Pulo), alternatively known as Melayu Campuran (Mixed Malay) or Melayu Kepulauan Seribu (Thousand Islands Malay) is a Malay-based creole spoken by the Orang Pulo people inhabiting the Thousand Islands off the coast of Jakarta, Indonesia. This language emerged from a mixture of many languages in Indonesia, particularly Bugis and Malay.\nHistory\nThe population of the Thousand Islands is believed to have originated and begun from Panggang Island. As settlements in the Thousand Islands expanded, the spread of the population and its culture continued from one island to another, such as Pari Island, Untung Jawa, Tidung, and several other islands.\nThe culture and characteristics of the inhabitants of Panggang Island at that time were very different from those of the Betawi people, despite their proximity to the urban area of Jakarta. They also did not share similarities with the Bantenese, even though some of the early inhabitants originated from Banten. The people of Panggang Island exhibited unique tendencies, characteristics, and culture. Their culture was a blend of Bantenese culture, Kalimantan culture (particularly the Tidung and Banjar), Mandar culture from Sulawesi, Sundanese culture, and a bit of Betawi culture and character. This complex mixture resulted in a new culture and characteristics. The Orang Pulo, the original inhabitants of Panggang Island, subsequently shaped the culture and characteristics of the population of the Thousand Islands.\nThe blend of cultures that created the unique characteristics and culture in the Thousand Islands can also be seen in their language style, gestures, and way of thinking. Their speech is more robust and loud, similar to that of people from Sulawesi, lively and agile like the typical Bantenese, along with other tribal characteristics from Indonesia. This distinctiveness extends to the naming of traditional Orang Pulo cuisine, which has its own unique language style. For example, a dish similar to lontong or nasi uduk is called selingkuh, and fresh sambal for grilled fish is referred to as sambal beranyut.\nCurrent condition\nAccording to research conducted by students from the Indonesian Language and Literature Study Program at HKBP Nommensen University in 2023, the Pulo language is beginning to be endangered and is experiencing a shift due to the influx of newcomers who use standard Indonesian. As a result, many local residents there are also switching to using standard Indonesian. This is also supported by the use of foreign languages, especially English, which is considered important by the community because the Thousand Islands is a tourist area. Most of the local community in the Thousand Islands are multilingual or able to speak and understand two or more languages.\nPronunciation\nThe people of the Thousand Islands have a slightly unique speaking style. Their accent sounds different from the accent commonly spoken by Jakarta residents in the urban areas. Although there are many similarities overall, this accent is clearly distinct from the popular Jakarta accent used in television broadcasts. The speech tone of people from Pramuka Island sounds more 'ups and downs', and the vocabulary they use can sometimes be difficult for outsiders to understand.\nThe term \"Orang Pulo\" is commonly used for people originating from Panggang Island, Pramuka Island, and Karya Island. However, generally, this term can also be used for the residents of the Thousand Islands in general, distinguishing them from the term \"Orang Daratan\" (people who live on the mainland of Jakarta). Panggang Island has also been mentioned as the earliest inhabited island in the Thousand Islands. Nowadays, this island is densely populated. The first generation inhabitants of this island are known to have originated from Bantenese and the Mandar ethnic group.\nIn the book Orang Pulo di Pulau Karang by Rosida Erowati Irsyad, the Orang Pulo use the Indonesian language with a Malay accent. The Orang Pulo are said to have strong articulation of voice, as well as a distinctive language structure and vocabulary. There are four language styles used by its speakers, namely the style from Kelapa Island (near Harapan Island) which is characterized by long and undulating vowel pronunciation, the style from Tidung Island  influenced by the Tidung language and the Tangerang coast (especially the Tangerang Sundanese language), then the style from Untung Jawa Island  which still retains a strong Betawi accent, and the language style of the Pulo people (namely the people of Panggang Island, Pramuka Island, and Karya Island ) which is influenced by the Malay and Bugis languages.\nVocabulary\nHere are some distinctive vocabulary terms in the language of the Orang Pulo, as found in the book Orang Pulo di Pulau Karang:\natret: 'mundur' (to move backward)\npotret: 'maju' (to move forward)\npangkeng: 'kamar' (room)\nmonro: 'istirahat' (rest)\ngodot: 'menyulam benang' (to sew thread)\nThese terms are u",
    "Football tournament\nFootball tournament\nThe CFU Club Shield, also known as the CFU Caribbean Club Shield and formerly as the CONCACAF Caribbean Club Shield, is an annual Caribbean football competition for clubs that are members of the Caribbean Football Union (CFU). It is a second-tier competition to the CONCACAF Caribbean Cup (and formerly the Caribbean Club Championship), introduced in 2018 for clubs which worked towards professional standards. It is organized by the CFU, with CONCACAF organizing it between 2018 and 2023.\nUntil 2022, the winner of this competition, as long as it fulfilled the licensing criteria, played against the fourth-placed team of the Caribbean Club Championship for a place in the CONCACAF League. As of 2023, the winner and runner-up qualify for the CONCACAF Caribbean Cup.\nHistory\nOn 25 July 2017 in San Francisco, California, the CONCACAF Council approved the implementation of a two-tier competition for affiliated clubs of Caribbean member associations, starting in 2018. The tier-one competition, known as the Caribbean Club Championship, would be contested by the champions and runners-up of the top professional and semi-professional leagues in year one, and open to only fully professional leagues in year two onwards. The tier-two competition, known as the Caribbean Club Shield, would be contested by the champions of the leagues that had no professional teams in year one (2018), opened to semi-professional standards in year two (2019) and planned to be open to fully professional leagues by 2022.\nIn 2023, both tournaments were restructured and renamed. The winner and runner-up of the second-tier Caribbean Shield now qualify for the first-tier CONCACAF Caribbean Cup to be held later in the same month.\nOn 30 April 2024, CONCACAF officially gave the responsibility to organize the Caribbean Club Shield to the Caribbean Football Union, and as such the name of the competition was changed to the CFU Club Shield.\nResults\nParticipating leagues\nLegend\nSee also\nLeagues Cup\nCONCACAF Central American Cup\nCONCACAF Champions Cup\nNotes and references\n^ \"Dominican Republic Selected to Host Inaugural CONCACAF Caribbean Club Shield\". mailchi.mp.

    "Political party in Bulgaria\nVelichie (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0435, lit.\u2009'Greatness') is a Bulgarian political party led by former National Guard Service lieutenant colonel Nikolay Markov\u00a0. The party's positions are strong in Vetrino Municipality.\nHistory\nUntil 2007, Nikolay Markov\u00a0 served for 14 years in the National Guard Service\u00a0 (NSO), the service that guards Bulgaria's presidents, prime ministers, ministers and top politicians. Although Markov was known as \"the colonel\", he left the system with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He left the NSO in 2007 after a scandal with then-president Georgi Parvanov, whom he accused of abusing his power by collecting information that was inconvenient for politicians. After that, Markov appeared in some media as an expert on national security and counterterrorism.\nThe Velichie party was founded in the summer of 2023 around the figure of Markov. The party appeared on the Bulgarian political scene during the 2023 Bulgarian local elections, when they gained 40.51% of the votes in the Vetrino Municipality. Velichie is closely linked to the Vetrino Municipality: one of the major figures in the party is Ivelin Mikhailov, the head of a historical park located in the region and an organizer of patriotic events. Mikhailov was once close to Revival chairman Kostadin Kostadinov, but he distanced himself from the party in favor of Velichie in 2023. Velichie has its own paramilitary organization, called \"Bulgarski Yunak\" (lit.\u2009'Bulgarian Hero') and registered as a sports club, led by Ivelin Mikhailov. The organization's military training includes \"urban survival\" and \"building capture and retreat with covering fire.\"\nIn April 2024, Velichie leader Nikolay Markov announced that the party would participate in snap parliamentary election and in the European Parliament election. Viktoriya Vasileva\u00a0, a former member of the National Assembly from Union of Democratic Forces and then from There is Such a People, also participates in the work of the Velichie party. She is the leader Sofia regional party list in the 2024 elections.\nAccording to calculations by Bulgarian sociological agencies, as well as a Gallup parallel calculation, the Velichie party passes the 4% electoral threshold for the parliamentary election and gains about 12 mandates in the National Assembly. Earlier, Markov stated that he does not believe that Velichie will enter the National Assembly in the election on 9 June 2024.\nIdeology\nAccording to Nikolay Markov, the main goals of the party are to promote Bulgarian investments in the country, accelerate the completion of the Belene Nuclear Power Plant and bring the fight against organized crime in the country to the European level. Markov also pointed out the prevention of Bulgaria's participation in the military conflict in Ukraine, suspending the legal possibilities of such military intervention.\nBulgarian media call Velichie a Russophile and anti-Western party, competing with Revival in this field.\n",
    "Species of lichen\nUmbilicaria torrefacta is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Umbilicariaceae. It is an arctic-alpine species with a circumpolar distribution and is widely distributed within the Holarctic realm, specifically within the Palearctic and Neoarctic biogeographical regions. Characteristic features of Umbilicaria torrefacta include the lace-like fringe in its lobes and the plates on the underside of the thallus. One common name, punctured rock-tripe, refers to the distinctive sieve-like perforations on the thallus margins.\nThe species was first scientifically described in 1777 by John Lightfoot and later classified under the genus Umbilicaria by Heinrich Schrader in 1794. Because of its somewhat variable morphology, this species has often been misidentified historically and described under different names, resulting in an extensive synonymy. In 2017, a lectotype specimen was designated for the species, clarifying its taxonomic status. Molecular phylogenetics studies have revealed complex relationships within the family Umbilicariaceae, resulting in the revision of the genus Umbilicaria. U.\u00a0torrefacta is a member of Gyrophora, a subgenus characterised by species with circular ridges on the discs of their apothecia; rigid, non-pustulate thalli; and specific secondary metabolites, such as gyrophoric acid and stictic acid.\nUmbilicaria torrefacta has distinct spectral properties, transmitting very little light and significantly altering the spectral signature of rock surfaces. It shows slow initial growth and delayed reproduction, with reproductive output increasing linearly with thallus size. The population structure is skewed towards smaller individuals, indicating ongoing recruitment and colonisation in newly exposed areas. These characteristics enable U.\u00a0torrefacta to adapt and maintain a stable presence in challenging alpine environments.\nUmbilicaria torrefacta can be compared to U.\u00a0dura, U.\u00a0multistrata, and U.\u00a0semitensis, all of which share similarities in appearance but can be distinguished by differences in spore type, thallus structure, colouration, and chemical components, with specific distinctions in geographical distribution and spore size. Umbilicaria torrefacta has historical significance in the Scottish Highlands for its use as a natural dye in wool and fabric, producing a range of purplish-red to greyish-magenta hues, with the fermentation method yielding rich red and purple dyes, valued for traditional tartans and textiles.\nTaxonomy\nUmbilicaria torrefacta was first described in 1777 by the English parson-naturalist John Lightfoot, as Lichen torrefactus. The type specimen was collected by Lightfoot in the Scottish Highlands. He called it a \"sad-colour'd crumpled Lichen, with black curled warts\" and noted that it was \"frequent upon the highland rocks\". The species epithet torrefacta comes from the Latin word meaning \"roasted\", which aptly describes the lichen's dark brown, glazed upper surface. In 1794, Heinrich Schrader reclassified the species under the genus Umbilicaria, resulting in the current binomial name, Umbilicaria torrefacta. The genus name Umbilicaria was introduced by Georg Franz Hoffmann, and it includes mostly rock-dwelling species primarily found in boreal, alpine, and Arctic regions worldwide.\nOne of Dillenius' herbarium specimens, illustrated here as image #118 on plate 30 of Historia muscorum, was chosen to be the lectotype of Umbilicaria torrefacta.\nLightfoot's description highlighted several key features of the lichen. He observed that it consists of one or several leaves of a somber black, brown, or dull hue, connected at the base by a central point or umbilicus. He noted the upper side to be wrinkled with lobed and uneven margins, and a higher concentration of thin, compressed fibres and granulation towards the centre. The space between the fibres is finely granulated, and he compared the resulting slight roughness similar to the texture of shagreen, a type of textured leather. He also described the fruiting bodies as numerous, wrinkled, black sessile tubercles that seem to be composed of curled hairs, resembling those of Umbilicaria cylindrica, though less regular and less shiny. Lightfoot remarked that this lichen was represented in one of the well-known images of cryptogams depicted by Johann Jacob Dillenius in his 1741 work Historia muscorum.\nUmbilicaria torrefacta is known for its distinctive sieve-like perforations on the thallus margins, leading to vernacular names such as \"punctured rock-tripe\", or \"perforated rock-tripe\". The perforations may be more readily seen if held up against a light. This characteristic feature makes it relatively easy to distinguish from other species within the genus. \"Torn brain-moss\" is a  historical vernacular name for the species that was suggested by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821.\nDespite detailed early descriptions, proper typification of U.\u00a0torrefacta faced challenges due to a history of",

    "Australian TV channel\nTelevision channel\n10 Bold Drama is an Australian free-to-air digital television multichannel owned by Network 10. It originally launched on 26 March 2009 as One HD with a focus on broadcasting sports-based programming and events, but rebranded to One in April 2011 to more reality, scripted and adventure-based programming aimed at males between the ages of 25 and 54. As of October 2018, the channel now primarily broadcasts dramatic programming aimed towards viewers 40 and older.\nDue to the relaunch of 10 HD on 2 March 2016, it was reduced to a standard-definition broadcast for 5 years until 23 September 2021 at 6am when it switched to HD.\nHistory\nSports format channel\nThe channel commenced broadcasting as One HD on 26 March 2009 at 7.00\u00a0pm in Melbourne (due to live coverage of the Australian Football League) and at 7.30\u00a0pm in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The channel, owned by Network Ten, featured nonstop sport content including live sport, sports documentaries and sports-themed movies.\nOne initially broadcast in high definition on digital channels 1 and 11 with a standard-definition simulcast on digital channel 12 known as One SD or One Digital. At launch, One replaced the previous Ten HD service and a standard-definition simulcast of Ten HD called TenSD2.\nOne HD began broadcasting on Macquarie Media Group's owned and operated Southern Cross Ten regional television stations on digital channel 50 at 7.00\u00a0pm on 2 July 2009. Tasmania didn't broadcast it until 30 July 2009, and Mildura didn't broadcast it until 1 December 2009.\nThe simulcast on digital channel 11 was later reallocated for Ten's standard-definition digital multichannel Eleven (now 10 Peach) on 15 December 2010 in preparation for its launch on 11 January 2011. As a result, the channel's high definition simulcast was moved to channel 12, replacing the standard-definition simulcast.\nIn 2011, the channel began to dilute its all-sport format to include adventure-themed reality programming such as Ice Road Truckers and Black Gold, and a weekly feature-length movie or documentary, usually, but not limited to, a sporting theme. In April 2011, it was revealed that the channel would shift to a more broad general entertainment channel aimed towards a younger male demographic, whilst still featuring sports programming.\nSports and entertainment channel\nIt was confirmed on 4 April 2011 that due to unsupportable overheads associated with running the station as an \"all-sport\" channel, One HD would begin to air more general entertainment programming alongside sport, particularly shows aimed at an older male audience and would also be rebranded as One. The changes were intended to make the channel a greater competitor against 7mate, which has a similar scope, and took place on 7 May 2011.\nOne's updated schedule included factuals such as Everest: Beyond the Limit, Extreme Fishing with Robson Green, Airline, Long Way Round, Ice Road Truckers, An Idiot Abroad, Cops, dramas such as Terriers, Lights Out, Sons of Anarchy, Burn Notice, Breakout Kings and Psych and films such as The Last King of Scotland, 28 Weeks Later, Babylon AD, Jarhead, Pitch Black, Doom, Hitman,  The Manchurian Candidate, Diagnosis Murder and Walker, Texas Ranger.\n2018 rebrand\nOn 31 October 2018, One relaunched as 10 Boss, as part of a larger rebranding of Network Ten. Chief content officer Beverley McGarvey described \"Boss\" as reflecting an overall \"attitude\" in its programming, exemplified by a focus on characters with \"bold\" personalities or could be reasonably described as being a \"boss\" (such as Judge Judy). 10 Boss primarily targets viewers over the age of 40, and focuses primarily on dramas (such as Madam Secretary and NCIS).\nOn 10 December 2018, the channel was renamed 10 Bold, due to trademark conflicts with Fairfax Media (which had completed its merger with Nine Entertainment Co.) and the Australian Financial Review publication Boss. A press release promoting the rebranding acknowledged the conflict, describing the change as being an \"early Christmas present to Nine\", and quipping that \"it's better to be bold than bossy\".\nOn 5 June 2024, it was announced that the channel would rebrand as 10 Bold Drama on 12 June 2024, as part of a rebranding of Bold and Peach to include their main genres in their names.\nProgramming\nThe channel targets a broad range of viewers, broadcasting programs from Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, and complementing existing programming on Ten.\nPrograms aired on the channel are scripted and adventure-based programming aimed at males between the ages of 25 and 54, mix of genres, including reality, lifestyle, drama, classic sitcoms from the 60s, 70s and 80s, comedies, live sport and action films.\nAs a result of the revival of 10 HD on 2 March 2016, the channel was reduced to standard definition.\nOriginal programming\nCurrent programming\nDocumentary\n48 Hours\nBondi Rescue\nDrama\nBull\nThe Code\nCSI: Cri",
    "Reynista\u00f0ur, previously Sta\u00f0ur \u00ed Reynisnesi (\u201cSite in Reynisnes\u201d), is a town in Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur\u2014a fjord in the north of Iceland. Reynista\u00f0ur is the location of an old manor. \u00deorfinnur karlsefni (\u201cthe makings of a man\u201d) was from Reynista\u00f0ur and lived there for some time with his wife, Gu\u00f0r\u00ed\u00f0ur \u00deorbjarnard\u00f3ttir after they returned from Vinland. During the Age of the Sturlungs, it was one of the residences of the \u00c1sbirningar family clan. Kolbeinn kaldalj\u00f3s (\u201ccold light\u201d) Arn\u00f3rsson, also called Sta\u00f0ar-Kolbeinn, lived there as did his son Brandur Kolbeinsson later on.\nGissur \u00deorvaldsson later acquired Reynista\u00f0ur, which was said to have become the jarl's residence because Gissur had received the title of jarl. Gissur donated Reynista\u00f0ur for the establishment of a convent. He died in 1268, but the Reynista\u00f0ur Abbey was not established until 1295; it operated until the Reformation. Although the abbey was eventually closed down, the nuns received permission to live out the rest of their days there. No artifacts or other visible relics from the abbey have been found in Reynista\u00f0ur, but there are other place names that link to the abbey.\nThe abbey acquired a number of estates that the king came into possession of after the Reformation, which his representatives, called abbey magistrates, were in charge of supervising. Many of them lived in Reynista\u00f0ur, including:\nOddur Gottsk\u00e1lksson, lawyer\nSigur\u00f0ur J\u00f3nsson (died 1602) and his son J\u00f3n Sigur\u00f0sson (died 1635), a lawyer\nJens Spendrup, s\u00fdsluma\u00f0ur (sheriff)\nHalld\u00f3r V\u00eddal\u00edn Bjarnason and father of the Reynista\u00f0ur brothers, who lived in Reynista\u00f0ur from 1768 to 1800 and whose widow, Ragnhei\u00f0ur Einarsd\u00f3ttir, was the abbey magistrate from 1803 to 1814\nEinar Stef\u00e1nsson, a student, grandfather of the poet Einar Benediktsson\nWhen Reynista\u00f0ur's old barn was torn down in 1935, the barn door, which was built in the typical 18th century stave construction, was kept in place. The door was later moved and a concrete storehouse was built onto it. In 1999, a gate was built near the original location of the barn, turf walls were added, and the roof was also covered in turf. It is now a heritage site held by the National Museum of Iceland.\nThere has been a church in Reynista\u00f0ur from the time the town was founded, and the existing church, which is made of wood, was consecrated in 1870. The church is now a protected site. It is said that the jarl Gissur is buried under the church floor.\n",

    "Nature and archaeology park in Israel\nShoham park is a park located east of the town of Shoham, Israel, between Highway 444 to the west and Highway 6 to the east, and between the \"Bareket\" industrial area to the north and Nahal Beit Arif to the south.\nGeography and history\nThe park's area is about two square kilometers, its length from north to south is 1,750 meters, and its width from east to west is 1,250 meters. It spans several hills with heights ranging from 60 to 140 meters above sea level. Despite the park's name, the forest within it is quite sparse, and most of it is a rocky and rugged area. The Israel National Trail crosses the park from north to south in its western part.\nThe Jewish National Fund began developing the park in 1987 as part of the \"Hill Axis\" program, intended to connect forest areas, nature reserves, and agricultural lands, from the sources of the Yarkon in the north to Canada Park in the south. Walking and mountain biking trails, off-road vehicle paths, and picnic areas were prepared in the forest. Three underground passages beneath Highway 444 connect the park to Shoham. Additionally, an observation deck was prepared at the top of the \"Cupmarks and Mortars\" hill, offering a view westward to the coastal plain and eastward towards the Samarian hills. The observation deck includes a memorial site for Sergeant Guy Soday, who died in Lebanon in 1994. The hill got its name due to the various-sized depressions carved into the rock. The small depressions are called \"cupmarks,\" possibly used as ancient altars; the larger ones are called \"mortars\" and were used for grinding grains and herbs.\nIn the park area, remains of settlements from the Mishnah and Talmudic periods and several ancient caves were discovered. At its center are the remains of \"Horvat Tinshemet,\" where the remains of the Bacchus Church from the Byzantine period were uncovered. The church was exposed in 1995 during rescue excavations and is dated to the 6th century. Its area is about 100 square meters, divided into three naves by six columns. The church features a mosaic floor in black, white, red, and orange colors, with a Greek inscription reading \"of Saint Bacchus,\" which gave the church its name. The mosaic includes geometric designs, an amphora from which vines with grape clusters emerge. In a geometric frame, an artichoke with leaves on both sides is depicted. Near the church, a replica of the Madaba Map mosaic was placed, identifying Horvat Tinshemet with \"Beto-melgezis.\" Near the church, an oil press and a water pool were found. The site is accessible and organized.\nIn 2016, development works were approved in an abandoned quarry area in the southwestern part of the park as part of a fast-track preferred housing plan. Under this plan, it was permitted to establish public facilities related to the forest. Nevertheless, various developers and the Shoham Economic Company later promoted plans to build a theater for mass performances in the abandoned quarry area and even beyond it. Following protests from citizens and environmental activists, concerns were raised that the plan might harm the delicate ecological fabric of the forest, traffic arrangements, and the quality of life of the area's residents. In August 2023, after thousands of supporters called for rehabilitation that considers the health of the environment and residents, some candidates for the Shoham Council elections declared that they would consider changing or canceling the plan.\nFauna and flora\nThe park serves as a home for wildlife and plants, some of which are endangered. Among the mammals living there, one can count the common fox, Indian porcupine, golden jackal, wild boar, and the mountain gazelle (globally endangered). Alongside a variety of trees, shrubs, and rocky hills, the park is also a habitat for special wild plants that can be used for medicinal purposes, such as common hyssop, pink savory, common thyme, white-leaved savory, two-colored sage, and three-lobed sage. Additionally, the park is home to blooming wild plants such as the common cyclamen, winter crocus, and autumn crocus.\nSelected flowers in Shoham Forest Park (by their blooming period)\n",

    "2023 historical drama film\n1521 (also knows in United States as 1521: The Quest for Love and Freedom) is a 2023 historical drama film written by Mary Krell-Oishi and directed by Michael Barder. It stars Danny Trejo, Bea Alonzo, Costas Mandylor, Michael Copon, Hector David Jr., Maricel Laxa, Vic Romano, Floyd Tena, Larissa Buendia. The film is about the battle of Lapu-Lapu and Ferdinand Magellan in Mactan, Cebu and about the love story of a native princess and a Spanish soldier.\nPlot\nA woman experiences a dream depicting what is implied to be a flashback from her previous life.\nIn 1521, Spaniards led by Ferdinand Magellan arrive in Cebu seeking to establish Spanish rule and develop trade relations with its leader, Raja Humabon. While Humabon is willing to accommodate the Spaniards in the hopes of increased prosperity, Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of the neighboring island of Mactan, refuses to accept their loss of independence. In an effort to convince Lapu-Lapu, Magellan and Humabon arrange for the former's interpreter, a Malay slave named Enrique, to live in Mactan as their intermediary. Lapu-Lapu treats Enrique as a guest, while the latter develops a romance with Mactan's babaylan, Diwata. However, her brother, Lapulapu's chief soldier Udong, is wary of the Spaniards' intentions and threatens Enrique over his relationship with Diwata. Despite this, Enrique becomes sympathetic with Mactan and advises Magellan to treat its inhabitants with respect, while trying to convince Lapu-Lapu to submit peacefully.\nEnrique's efforts are undermined when a group of Spanish soldiers led by Lorenzo loot a village, forcing Magellan to order the flogging of one of those involved to avert a conflict. Eventually, Lapu-Lapu breaks off negotiations when he, Diwata and Udong attend Humabon's baptism ceremony, during which the latter and his people are made to kneel before a cross and burn icons of their gods. An offended Diwata runs away, while Enrique is warned off by Udong from pursuing her. Later, Diwata reconciles with Enrique and pledges her love, leading to them agreeing to elope to the village of Buaya. Arriving there, Diwata comes across the village being looted by Spanish soldiers and is knocked unconscious by Lorenzo, who steals her necklace. Enrique, who is in Diwata's village at the time of the attack, is told to leave by Lapu-Lapu for his own safety. Diwata, again feeling betrayed following the attack on Buaya, returns to her village, but is told that Enrique had been looking for her, restoring her faith in him and prompting her to run off again in search for Enrique.\nEnrique makes a futile attempt to convince Magellan not to go to war with Lapu-Lapu, but accompanies him anyway to battle. Arriving at a beach, Enrique then appeals one last time to Lapu-Lapu to surrender, which the latter refuses. The ensuing battle results in heavy losses for both sides, culminating in Magellan being badly wounded by Lapu-Lapu before being finished off by his men. Enrique is captured but is spared at the last minute after Diwata runs to his side and pleads for his life. Lapu-Lapu allows her to see Enrique off at the shoreline to be with his comrades. However, Enrique snatches Diwata's necklace from Lorenzo and runs back to return it to her. Lorenzo fires a gun at the couple, but is then killed by Udong with a spear. The bullet hits Enrique, who dies in Diwata's arms.\nIn the present, the woman wakes up and embraces her partner, who is implied to be a reincarnation of Enrique.\nCast\nDanny Trejo as Ferdinand Magellan\nBea Alonzo as Diwata\nCostas Mandylor as Lorenzo\nMichael Copon as Lapu-Lapu\nHector David Jr. as Enrique\nMaricel Laxa as Ahmani\nVic Romano as Udong\nFloyd Tena as Humabon\nLarissa Buendia as Humamai\nSol Eugenio as Datu\nEren Kereci as Spanish Soldier\nProduction\nOn August 4, 2022, Bea Alonzo was confirmed to be part of the film. The film has a working title 1521: The Battle of Mactan and their Shooting will be done in Puerto Princesa City and Taytay, Palawan.\nControversies\nIssues with Bea Alonzo\nThe production and release of the film was marred by controversy between the lead actress Bea Alonzo and the film crew. Among these were allegations such as Alonzo bringing along additional staff to her provided accommodations and the resulting disputes over costs, problems with her costume and what the producers said were \"unreasonable\" demands from Alonzo. Entertainment reporter Ogie Diaz also said that a real Bolo knife used in the film ended up injuring several actors.\nProducer Francis Ho subsequently apologized to Alonzo for these issues, which he attributed to his being a first-time producer. Alonzo did not attend the movie's premier night on May 29, 2024.\nHistorical inaccuracies\nThe film was criticized for its historical inaccuracies such as in costumes, armor and language. Some also criticised Bea Alonzo's casting as a native princess, stating that she looked more like one of the colonizers than a local.\nRelease\nThe film has a limited rele",
    "\nOne nation, two states (simplified Chinese: \u4e00\u56fd\u4e24\u5e9c; traditional Chinese: \u4e00\u570b\u5169\u5e9c; lit. 'one country, two governments') presuppose that China is \"one country\" (or \"one nation\") in cross-strait relations, but they want to recognize the political situation in which the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the government of the Republic of China (ROC) coexist. This is mainly supported by some Kuomintang politicians who oppose the PRC's one country, two systems, and it was the U.S. government that first proposed it. The People's Republic of China opposes the One nation, two states because it claims to be China's \"only legitimate government\" (\u552f\u4e00\u5408\u6cd5\u653f\u5e9c). \"One nation, two states\" is basically based on one China principles, so it shouldn't be confused with \"Two Chinas\".\nHistory\nIn 1990, under the support of the United States, the National Unification Council, chaired by President of the Republic of China Lee Teng-hui, proposed \"One nation, two states\" to the People's Republic of China, but the proposal was rejected because the People's Republic of China feared that the dialogue between the two central governments would be distorted.\nWhen Chen Shui-bian, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, was elected president of the Republic of China in 2000, then Kuomintang leader Lien Chan proposed \"One nation, two states\", \"federal system\", and \"national unification system\" again and opposed Taiwan independence.\nThe official statement of the People's Republic of China on the Taiwan question, the one-China principle, is that \"there is only one China in the world, the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China, and anything can be discussed on the premise of one China\". In the 2000s, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China stated that the basic policy of resolving the Taiwan issue is \"there is only one China in the world, and Taiwan belongs to one China\" and it also stated the following:\nThere is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, with its central Government in Beijing. This is a fact recognized by the world and a prerequisite for the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question. The Chinese government firmly opposes any words or deeds aimed at splitting China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, opposes 'two Chinas', 'one China, one Taiwan' or 'one country, two governments', and opposes all attempts that may lead to the 'Taiwan independence', and opposes all attempts and acts that may lead to 'Taiwan independence'.\nSee also\nChina portalTaiwan portal\nChinese unification\nConservatism in Taiwan\n",
    "Concert tour by Joker Xue\nThe Extraterrestrial World Tour is the third concert tour and second world tour by Chinese singer-songwriter Joker Xue. As of June 2024, the tour has 121 shows across four continents with 111 in Asia, 2 in Europe, 5 in North America, and 3 in Oceania.\nAll venues in mainland China are stadiums and most stops have 2\u20133 shows in a row. All overseas venues are arenas.\nBackground\nOn July 13, 2021, Xue announced the tour by posting the Extraterrestrial World Tour poster on Weibo. On July 24, at the Chaole Music Festival, Xue shared the tour is both a concert and a story with a lot of \"silly plotlines\" that should be \"extremely fun.\"\nExtraterrestrial World Tour opened in October 2021 with two shows in Suzhou followed by two shows in Guangzhou the next month. In 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the announced dates were postponed and only the Haikou concert was successfully held on December 24, 2022. In March 2023, the tour resumed and for the rest of the year, Xue mostly maintained the pace of one stop per week and frequently with several shows per stop.\nAs of June 2024, Extraterrestrial World Tour spans more than 50 cities, putting Xue's principle of \"if I take one more step, you will take one fewer step,\" meaning he wishes to lessen the burden of travelling to concerts for his fans, into practice\nConcert synopsis\nAs Xue said, the Extraterrestrial World Tour is both a concert and a story. In it, he transforms into interstellar executive, codename 0717, who was ordered to destroy Earth. However, he is moved by the goodness of humans and sacrifices himself to save them. The concert is interspersed with jokes and the pre-recorded videos are filmed in a comedic manner, showcasing his \"zany brand of humour.\"\nEach concert consists of five acts, with pre-recorded videos and talking segments where Xue interacts with the audience. Throughout the concert, positive messaging about treating each other with kindness and improving our world through one small act at a time is conveyed.\nPre-recorded Video 1 introduces the \"Regulations on the Joint Protection of Space Creatures\" which Earth has been found in violation of. Interstellar Executive 0717's arrival on earth is portrayed through songs such as \"Extraterrestrial\" (\u5929\u5916\u6765\u7269) and \"The Return of the Prince\" (\u738b\u5b50\u5f52\u6765). He is there to carry out Earth's destruction. In Talking Segment 1, Xue questions the audience if any of them purchased their tickets via scalpers.\nPre-recorded Video 2 mentions that 0717 needs to bring back three Earth species to Interstellar Headquarters. Humans fight over the chance for escape, their selfishness is highlighted through songs such as \"Ambition\" (\u91ce\u5fc3) and \"Animal World\" (\u52a8\u7269\u4e16\u754c). In Talking Segment 2, Xue asks the audience whether they would assist the elderly before transforming into an elderly lady who has fallen down and requires the audience to sing the song \"Actor\" (\u6f14\u5458) in unison to help her get back up. The audience succeeds and their selfless act moves 0717.\nIn Pre-record Video 3, 0717 is in disbelief that he feels such strong emotions toward humans. To figure out why, he travels back in time to see what Earth was like in the past. He is transported to Xue's 2017 I Think I've Seen You Somewhere Tour and through a \"Medley\" (\u7ec4\u66f2\u4e32\u70e7) of more than 15 songs, 0717 realizes that he was human in his previous life.\nIn Pre-recorded Video 4, the Interstellar Headquarters, impatiently with 0717's lack of progress, send forces to destroy. 0717 successfully negotiates for a delay and expresses his belief that humans can become better through \"Turn Waste Into Treasure\" (\u53d8\u5e9f\u4e3a\u5b9d) and demonstrate the humans' resolve to improve through Stay Here. However, the Interstellar Headquarters remain set on destroying Earth. 0717 sacrifices himself to protect Earth through Wandering With You (\u966a\u4f60\u53bb\u6d41\u6d6a).\nThe audience brings back Xue by calling his name, who returns with the song \"It's Been So Long\" (\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e45\u6ca1\u89c1). He then reflects back on the story with songs such as \"Cooperate\" (\u914d\u5408) and \"Idea\" (\u5ff5). Finally, Xue bids the audience farewell with \"Extraterrestrial\" (\u5929\u5916\u6765\u7269).\nFor overseas shows, the setlist is reduced as are the talking segments due to time constraint and stage setup.\nOne of the running jokes for Xue's concerts is the \"refund\" meme that's become a highlight.\nAnytime Xue says a wrong word, sings the wrong lyrics, or, on one memorable occasion, burps, the audience cheerfully shouts for a \"refund\" in response.\nStage design\nThe Extraterrestrial World Tour incorporates the use of a large spaceship above the stage is essential for the interstellar space theme. Before each concert, the production team uses 40 18-meter vans to load and transport parts then works continuously for 8 days using multiple cranes to lift the 30-ton spaceship to a height of 30 meters. In addition, there are several other pieces that are central to storytelling, such as the 9-meter-high \"Towers of Desire\" in the first act, the \"Carousel\" in the third act that transport 0717 ba",

The following year, Yeo became the first chairman of Ang Mo Kio Town Council, a position he served until 1995.\nIn the 1991 Singaporean general election, Ang Mo Kio SMC was merged with Kebun Baru SMC, Nee Soon South SMC, Teck Ghee SMC and Yio Chu Kang SMC to form Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency (GRC). Yeo contested for the Ang Mo Kio division of the Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency together with Lee Hsien Loong, Lau Ping Sum and Umar Abdul Hamid. They were elected unopposed on Nomination Day. Yeo retired as an MP in 1997.\nIn 2019, Yeo was awarded the PAP's Meritorious Service Star at the PAP65 Awards and Convention.\n",
    "Armenian-American businessman\nMoses Gulesian, center front, copper-works owner, with his staff and their cast of the lion and unicorn for the Old State House. 1901, Boston, Massachusetts\nMoses H. Gulesian was an Armenian-American businessman born on April 10, 1855, in Marash, in the Ottoman Empire. Seeking better opportunities and escaping persecution, Gulesian emigrated to the United States in 1883, where he would go on to become a successful entrepreneur and a notable philanthropist. He is well known for offering to buy the US Constitution to avoid its destruction which sparked a wave patriotism which later prompted the initiative to keep the ship and rebuild it.\nBackground\nMoses H. Gulesian married Anna Torosian, also of Armenian descent, and the couple had four children. Upon arriving in the United States, Gulesian settled in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he initially worked in a factory. Demonstrating a keen business acumen and a tireless work ethic, he quickly moved up the ranks and soon ventured into entrepreneurship. Gulesian founded a successful metalworking company, which specialized in manufacturing fine brass and copper products. His business, M.H. Gulesian & Sons, gained a reputation for high-quality craftsmanship and innovation, supplying products to various industries, including electrical, architectural, and industrial sectors.\nSamuel Atkins Eliot wrote, \"Here is another instance of American patriotism shown by Mr. Gulesian: fourteen years ago, when, authorized by the city of Boston, he made the lion and unicorn of copper to replace the historic ones on the Old State House, he bought the old ones to ensure their preservation, and today they adorn the lawn infront of his house.\"\nGulesian was known to help the Red Cross Society. He also spoke widely about the Armenian massacres from 1894 to 1896, during which many Armenians were indiscriminately massacred under Turkish rule.\nIn 1905, Secretary of the Navy Charles Joseph Bonaparte suggested that Constitution be towed out to sea and used as target practice, after which she would be allowed to sink. Moses H. Gulesian read about this in a Boston newspaper; he was a businessman from Worcester, Massachusetts, and he offered to purchase her for $10,000. The State Department refused, but Gulesian initiated a public campaign which began from Boston and ultimately \"spilled all over the country.\" The storms of protest from the public prompted Congress to authorize $100,000 in 1906 for the ship's restoration. First to be removed was the barracks structure on her spar deck, but the limited amount of funds allowed just a partial restoration. In an interview with The Boston Journal he said, \"My only intention in making this offer of $10,000 for the old Constitution was to save her from such a horrible end as being used as a target. If it is a question of price, I will raise my offer to $15,000.\" The navy refused the offer, but later it sparked a campaign, and more than 30,000 people signed a petition to save the ship. Later, the US government approved funds to have it repaired.\nMoses H. Gulesian passed away on July 13, 1951, in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n",

    "Brazilian physician\nErmelinda Lopes de Vasconcelos (1866 \u2013 1952) was a Brazilian doctor. She was the second female doctor to graduate from university in Brazil and the first in Rio de Janeiro state. As an obstetrician she is said to have been present at over ten thousand births.\nEarly life and education\nVasconcelos was born in Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul state on 23 September 1866, the daughter of Joaquim Lopes de Vasconcelos and Firmiana dos Santos. At the age of eight, she moved with her family to Rio de Janeiro, where her father worked as a bookkeeper at the Companhia de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o Fluvial (River Navigation Company).\nAt the time, one of the only ways for girls to remain in the education system after primary school was to study to become teachers. Vasconcelos graduated from the Escola Normal de Niter\u00f3i (Niter\u00f3i Normal School), a teacher-training school, in 1881 but had no real intention to become a teacher. In 1884, after much pressure from his daughter, her father consented for her to enrol at the Faculty of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro (now the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). Her ability to gain admission to the university had been made possible by an imperial decree only passed in 1879 that prohibited discrimination against women in higher education. There were two other women taking the same course, Rita Lobato and Antonieta C\u00e9sar Dias.\nVasconcelos obtained a degree in medicine in 1888 with a thesis entitled Clinical forms of meningitis in children: differential diagnosis\". An interesting aspect of her thesis hearing was that the evaluation panel was chaired by Emperor D. Pedro II. She became the first woman to graduate as a doctor in Rio de Janeiro and the second in Brazil, after Lobato, who had begun her studies in Rio de Janeiro but transferred to the Faculty of Medicine of Bahia and completed her studies in 1887.\nCriticism\nWomen studying medicine and becoming doctors encountered considerable hostility. While not necessarily representing the majority view, after her graduation there were several letters of complaint in local newspapers and in medical journals. For example, S\u00edlvio Romero, a poet, writer, and historian, who would later become a member of the elite Academia Brasileira de Letras (Brazilian Academy of Letters), wrote: \"Doctor, rest assured that your macho feet will not tread in my home.\" Ironically, Romero would later ask Vasconcelos to attend his wife for the delivery of their child. He even asked for a discount and to pay by instalments, to which she allegedly showed him a newspaper clipping of his letter and said: \"You will pay me dearly, and in one go!\"\nCareer\nVasconcelos married Dr. Alberto de S\u00e1, a gynaecologist and obstetrician, in 1889. She then continued her studies in 1900 in France, England, and Germany. Like her husband she also concentrated on gynaecology and obstetrics during her career and it is said that she was present at more than ten thousand births. She participated in the founding of the Medical-Surgical Association of Rio de Janeiro in 1921. Vasconcelos was also one of the pioneers of the Brazilian feminist movement, having founded, in 1922, with Bertha Lutz, the Liga Fluminense para o Progresso Feminino (The Rio de Janeiro State League for Women's Advancement).\nDeath\nVasconcelos died in Niter\u00f3i in 1952.\nLegacy\nBased on a survey of doctors carried out in Brazil in 2020, together with a study of registrations of new doctors, women now account for almost 50% of all doctors in the country.\n",
    "Australian surgeon (1910\u20132008)\nFrank Harland Mills AO (20 June 1910 \u2013 6 April 2008) was an Australian surgeon who specialised in thyroid surgery and cardiac surgery. He was also known for his work as a military physician as a Japanese prisoner-of-war (POW) during World War II.\nEarly life\nMills was born on 20 June 1910 in Armidale, New South Wales. He was one of four children born to Florence (n\u00e9e\u00a0Brown) and Percy Mills; his father was a local magistrate.\nMills' mother died when was six years old and he was raised by his father in Moruya; one of his older sisters was killed in a car crash when he was a child. He attended Wollongong High School and went on to the University of Sydney, graduating MBBS in 1933. He completed his residency at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH), also assisting Frank Rundle with his research on thyroid disease.\nCareer\nEarly work\nMills was appointed medical superintendent of Marrickville Hospital in 1937. He subsequently completed further training in England on a Walter and Eliza Hall scholarship and was admitted to Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1938. After returning to Australia he worked as an assistant surgeon at RPAH and St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney.\nMilitary service\nIn 1940 Mills enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. He was appointed as a captain in the 2/10th Australian General Hospital and dispatched to Singapore with the 8th Division. He established a small field hospital in the early days of the Malayan campaign and after the fall of Singapore became a Japanese prisoner of war.\nAfter a period at Changi Prison, Mills was moved to the Sandakan POW Camp on Borneo. In October 1943, he and other officers were moved to the Kuching POW camp, despite his attempts to remain at Sandakan. He ministered to his fellow prisoners using improvised methods, such as treating peptic ulcers using solutions of ash, and \"performed surgery under the most difficult conditions, using sterilised razor blades, sewing the incisions with sterilised thread taken from his shirt\".\nReturn to Australia\nAfter the war's end Mills was admitted to Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in 1947 and began working as an assistant to Hugh Poate at RPAH. He remained interest in thyroid surgery and in the late 1940s began performing heart surgery, following a Carnegie grant to study techniques overseas. He subsequent became a pioneer of surgical training in Australia.\nMills performed the first successful surgery to treat blue baby syndrome at RPAH. In 1952 he performed a surgical widening of the tricuspid valve and in 1955 he repaired an atrial septal defect in \"what is thought to be the first open-heart surgery done in Australia\". He also performed surgeries for coarctation of the aorta, patent ductus arteriosus, and mitral stenosis.\nPersonal life\nIn 1960 Mills married Elayne Smith, with whom he had two children, including composer Jonathan Mills. Outside medicine he was a part-owner of a vineyard in the Hunter Valley and was chairman of the pastoral company operating Wollogorang Station.\nMills died in Sydney on 2 April 2008, aged 97.\n",
    "This article is about a proverb. For literature and movie titles, see Let Sleeping Dogs Lie.\n\"Let sleeping dogs lie\" is an English proverb known at least since the 14th century. This saying  suggests that when an old problem is no longer causing anyone trouble, it might be better left undiscussed: \"Possibly he cohabited with Miss Bloggs, but don't mention it in front of his wife, let the sleeping dogs lie\", and dormant controversies should not be restarted even if they were never resolved. This intent is similar to the meanings of sayings like \"Don't rock the boat\", \"Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you\".\nHistory\nAn early version in Middle English: \"It is nought good a slepyng hound to wake\" belongs to Chaucer (c.\u20091385 AD, \"Troilus and Criseyde\", III.764) and is predated by earlier French: n'\u00e9sveillez pas lou chien qui dort, \"wake not the sleeping dog\" (early 14th century). The Chaucer's character, Pandarus, when uttering the phrase, is speaking literally, referring to Criseyde's ladies sleeping outside her chamber.\nThe Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs traces the following evolution of he saying:\nMiddle English: It is euill wakyng of a slepyng dog (1546, John Heywood in \"A Dialogue Conteinyng the Nomber in Effect of All the Prouerbes in the Englishe Tongues\");\nIt's best To let a sleeping mastiff rest (1681, Samuel Colvil in \"The Whigs Supplication\");\nTake my advice and  as little about him as he does about you. Best to let sleeping dogs lie (the first known use of the modern phrasing, 1824, Walter Scott in the \"Redgauntlet\").\nIn the 19th century the modern version was already popular. Widespread use in the 20th century (see Bryan and Mieder for some literary sources) made the proverb very recognizable, enabling some significant modifications, from \"It is my policy to let sleeping senators lie\" (Gore Vidal attacking his opponent Senator S. I. Hayakawa who was prone to napping in the chamber) to \u201clet sleeping dogmas lie\u201d (Edmund Gosse).\nOther languages\nThe German: Schlafende Hunde (\"sleeping dog\") was an idiom for a dangerous subject that should not be touched upon since at least the 16th century. The form of expression varies. German: schlafende Hunde wecken (\"to wake the sleeping dogs\") is to create an inconvenience to oneself by attracting attention.\nItalian: non svegliare il can che dorme dates back to c.\u20091345, when Bosone da Gubbio\u00a0 made a wordplay (Italian: non sveglian lo can che dorme) on an Italian: gran Can del Catai, the Chinese Emperor.\nExpression is known in Russian, usually in the form Russian: \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0445\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0438\u0445\u043e, \"don't wake up trouble while it is quiet\".\nThe idiom is unfamiliar to the speakers of Arabic who mostly fail to recognize its meaning.\nSee also\nThe dogs of war (phrase)\n",

    "\nRoberto Dur\u00e1n vs. H\u00e9ctor Camacho II, billed as When Legends Collide was a professional boxing match contested on \nJuly 14, 2001, for the NBA super middleweight title. This was the 119th and final professional fight of Dur\u00e1n's career.\nBackground\nFive years after their previous fight, H\u00e9ctor Camacho and Roberto Dur\u00e1n agreed to a rematch to take place in July 2001 in the Pepsi Center in Denver, Colorado. The 39-year old Camacho sported a 73\u20134\u20132 record but had not fought for a major world title since his 1997 loss to Oscar De La Hoya. Dur\u00e1n, meanwhile, came into the fight at 103\u201315 but had found himself suspended by the Nevada State Athletic Commission following a blowout loss to WBA middleweight champion William Joppy in 1998. Though he flirted with retirement after the Joppy fight, Dur\u00e1n continued to fight, and unable to fight in United States due to his suspension, fought twice in Latin America before being reinstated by the Nevada State Athletic Commission in August 2000 after passing a neurological examination.\nMuch like prior to their first encounter, Dur\u00e1n had little praise for the flamboyant Camacho stating \"This guy is a clown, he's no legend. There's only one legend. That's me.\" Likewise, Camacho was confident he would again defeat his senior opponent saying \"Being at 50 years old, he wants to go on and do miracles. He ain't done miracles before. He sure ain't going to do miracles now. He's going to come in there trying to do the impossible, and I'm ready for the impossible\" and \"I haven't been worried about the idea of losing to Roberto Duran, not at this stage. If I lose to this guy, I might as well retire.\" Unlike their previous fight, which was held in the middleweight division, this fight was in the super middleweight division with Duran's fringe NBA super middleweight title on the line. As the smaller Camacho had no experience in the division, the fighters agreed to a 163-pound catchweight\nThe venue for the fight was the 19,000-seat Pepsi Center, a sizeable increase from the Etess Arena which seated only around 5,000. Ticket sales were slow and only 3,000 tickets had been sold the day before the event though around 6,597 in attendance come the night of the fight.\nThe fight\nIn contrast to their relatively close first fight, Camacho controlled the fight, easily outboxing the aging Dur\u00e1n, who had a hard time landing punches and seemed to tire early in the fight. The fight went the full 12 rounds with Camacho securing a lopsided unanimous decision with two scores of 118-108 and one score of 114\u2013112.\nDur\u00e1n blamed his poor performance on the high altitude claiming \"It got to me in the fifth round.\"\nFight card\n^Note 1 For NBA Super Middleweight title\n",

    "\n2MASX J07322028+3138009, known as Abell 586 Brightest Cluster Galaxy, or simply Abell 586 BCG, is a massive type-cD elliptical galaxy residing in Abell 586 galaxy cluster located in the constellation Gemini. At a redshift of 0.143973, it is 2.5 billion light-years from Earth.\nCharacteristics\n2MASX J07322028+3138009 is one of the largest galaxies. With a diameter of 565,700 light-years, it is classified as the most luminous galaxy, typically old and red lying near the center of the cluster with an estimated black hole mass of 1.17 x 109 M\u2299.\nThe galaxy is uniformed in color with a well established richness correction at 0.10 magnitude/Abell richness class and narrow distribution of luminosity ranging at least 5 <% N <% 500 and a luminosity evolution with a rate dM/dt = 1.09 (1 + z)H0 mag yr -1, hinting 2MASX J07322028+3138009 was brighter during the past.\nThe galaxy is aligned with its parent cluster and has an extended galactic halo with a mass of M500 = 2.0 \u00d7 1014 to 1.5 \u00d7 1015\u2009M\u2299, which its outer component is found to be 10-40 times larger in scale. It has ~10 times of the total luminosity of the inner component, with it exhibits a steeper \u27e8\u03bc\u27e9-re relation than that of the elliptical fundamental plane.\nOne possible theory for 2MASX J07322028+3138009 having special properties is the process of galactic cannibalism. As a BCG, the galaxy might have engulfed and merged with satellite galaxies thus increasing its luminosity. Because dynamical friction is a mass-dependent process, such massive galaxies, will tend to merge quickly with the central galaxy. From major mergers, comes the building-up the mass of the central galaxy as well as reducing the number of massive satellite galaxies. It is estimated that the cannibalism rate is \u223c2L* per 5 \u00d7 109 yr according to Lauer, who looked for evidence of interactions between the BCG and secondary galaxies in the study in 1988. Not only to mention, as the galaxies merge with the entity, the active galactic nucleus in 2MASX J07322028+3138009 is triggered, as the accretion is sent spiraling towards its supermassive black hole.\nAbell 586\nThe galaxy cluster where 2MASX J07322028+3138009 is residing, is classfied as Bautz-Morgan type I cluster at redshift of z = 0.17, with an Abell richness class of 3. It has an X-ray emission LX = 1.11 x 1045 h\u22121 50 ergs s\u22121  with a peak that is coincident with the position of the brightest cluster galaxy. It is a massive galaxy cluster with M500 \u2273 2 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299. Researchers who studied the cluster found evidence of the interaction between dark matter and dark energy, whom they argued that this interaction suggests evidence of violation of the Equivalence Principle.\nIn another study, researchers analyzed the mass content of Abell 586, through optical data obtained with Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) mounted on the 8 m Gemini North telescope, and combining with the publicly available X-ray data taken by Chandra space telescope. They found, the cluster has a 68% confidence level, with velocity dispersion of 1000\u20131250\u00a0km s\u22121.\nFrom the projected mass distributions obtained through weak lensing and X-ray emission, researchers found it strikingly similar, with nearly circular geometry whom they suggested that Abell 586 is likely a truly relaxed cluster whose last major merger event occurred more than ~4 billion years ago.\n",
    "\nConcrete Winds is a death metal / deathgrind band based in Finland.\nHistory\nConcrete Winds was formed by PJ (vocals/guitar/bass) and Mikko (drums) after the disbanding in 2018 of \u00c5landic death metal band VORUM, of which both were founding members.\nThe name of the band is taken from the first verses of VORUM's song \"Current Mouth\"\u00a0: \"On naked shores / By concrete winds deformed / Leaving into the waters / In its blackness enthralled\".\nIn May 2019 their song \"Infant Gallow\" premiered online, thus announcing the existence of Concrete Winds publicly. \nAccording to an interview the band gave to Finnish zine Sinistrous Waves, \"When planning the start of the band,everything in our heads, no matter if it had to do with music, words or visuals, was fast/speed, brute force,loud, spikes, straightforward assault and more words and visions in this vein.\"\nTheir debut,  \"Primitive Force\", was then released on Sepulchral Voice Records on August 16th, 2019.  \nThe album, described by the label as \"an epitome of violence and a prime example of how far extreme metal can be driven without losing the musical aspects\", made immediately a strong impact in the underground death metal scene, gaining both the favor of extreme metal listeners as well as critical praise from several publications.  Exclaim! wrote that on \"Primitive Force\" Concrete Winds \"never loosen their grip, maintaining a startling level of energy that few bands can manifest, and which electrifies every facet of the music to become absolutely devastating\", and Decibel Magazine, which premiered the full album stream a few days before its release, stated that it was \" easily one of the most extreme records you\u2019ll hear this year, and yet never once does Primitive Force become monotonous. It\u2019s nonstop, don\u2019t mistake that part, but it\u2019s also astonishingly creative throughout\".\nThe band played the first live shows in Finland in 2020, appearing as a trio with the addition of Finnish musician Mika (previously in Finnish death metal band Obscure Burial) on second guitar and no bass player. As of 2024, this is still their current live line-up.\nIn 2021, after appearing at Copenhagen's renown death metal festival Kill-Town Deathfest, Concrete Winds released their second full-length titled \"Nerve Butcherer\" on November 26th, through Sepulchral Voice Records.\nThe album  has been described by most critics as surpassing the previous one in ferocity and harshness, with definitions such as  \" raging inferno that will torture the souls of the unsuspecting victims in less than half hour of punishments and audio torture\"  and a \"dose of pure madness in music form\".\nDuring 2022, Concrete Winds joined Finnish death metal band Demilich in November for the first half of their European tour, and played their first U.S. show at Saint Vitus in New York.\nIn 2023, the band took part in the \"Agony & Ecstasy Over Europe\" tour with Swiss death metal band B\u00f6lzer and Swedish black metal band Watain, then appeared   both at local festivals in Finland as well as at some major international metal festivals such as Brutal Assault and Party.San Metal Open Air.\nIn early 2024, Concrete Winds announced to have joined booking agency Goetia Productions and currently are due to play at different festivals across Europe, including as headliners at  the UK edition of Kill-Town Deathfest in October 2024. \nMembers\nCurrent members\nPJ (Jonatan Johansson) \u2013 vocals, guitar, bass (2019\u2013present)\nMikko Josefsson \u2013 drums (2019\u2013present)\nLive members\nMika \u2013 guitar (2020\u2013present)\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nPrimitive Force (Sepulchral Voice Records, 2019)\nNerve Butcherer (Sepulchral Voice Records, 2021)\n",

    "Indian-born Singaporean convicted of killing his mother in 2012\nSujay Solomon Sutherson (c.\u20091981 \u2013 8 September 2022) was a Singaporean prisoner who was convicted of the manslaughter of his mother Mallika Jesudasan in 2012. Sujay, who was born in India but emigrated in Singapore at age 15, was charged with murdering his mother, after he was arrested for using three knives to slit his mother's throat before attempting to decapitate her, and disposed of her body in a suitcase. Sujay was found to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and it severely impaired his mental responsibility at the time of the murder, which allowed Sujay's murder charge to be reduced to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. After a five-day trial in 2015, Sujay was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to life imprisonment. On 8 September 2022, seven years after he was sentenced, Sujay died at the age of 41 due to septicemia while serving his sentence at Changi Prison.\nEarly life\nChildhood and emigration to Singapore\nSujay Solomon Sutherson, the eldest of three children, was born in India in 1981. His father was an affluent businessman based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, while his mother Mallika Jesudasan was an ethnic Indian-Singaporean who hailed from Singapore; his parents married through the arrangement of\nSujay's maternal grandparents in 1979, and his mother settled in India with her husband. Mallika's mother died in 1981 while Mallika's father, who remarried to a divorcee with three children, died in 2001.\nBy the mid-1990s, the business of Sujay's father floundered, and due to this, Sujay's mother Mallika decided to move back to Singapore for better job prospects, and for the sake of providing her children better education, Sujay and his two younger siblings (a brother and sister) were brought back to Singapore by their mother; Sujay was 14 or 15 years old at the time when he first set foot into his mother's birth country, and he obtained Singapore citizenship sometime after emigrating there. Sujay, his siblings and mother were taken in by Mallika's younger sister Leela, and in addition to a domestic helper and Leela's elder son, the seven of them lived together in a four-room flat in Bukit Batok, and Mallika became a church secretary. Sujay's parents divorced barely two years after Mallika and their children moved back to Singapore. At the time of her death in 2012, Mallika worked as a public relations coordinator.\nSujay, who was eloquent and had a love for cricket, reportedly struggled in his late teens, but he eventually completed his university studies and graduated with an arts degree from the National University of Singapore (NUS).\nPsychiatric problems\nAccording to his family, Sujay's behaviour began to change in 2005, and eventually, at age 26, Sujay was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and although his family tried their best to help him and take care of him, it was reportedly a challenge as Sujay did not adhere to his medication and did not accept that he was mentally ill.\nBased on hospital records, in May 2006, Sujay was first hospitalized at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for 11 days after he was arrested for waving knives at his uncle, and was prescribed with antipsychotic medication. Initially, after his discharge, Sujay regularly attended his follow-up sessions, but he began to default on them in October 2006. Sujay was once again taken by his family members to the IMH in June 2007, after they reported that he had behaved in a hostile manner towards them, and he was hospitalized for about a month. Sujay went for follow-up check-ups in the next three years and six months, but he once again skipped his treatment thereafter. In February 2011, Sujay's mother and uncle observed that he had a relapse, but Sujay refused to accept treatment or even antipsychotic injections. In the following months, Sujay's family found that Sujay's condition had deteriorated and that they suspected that he had not been taking his medication regularly.\nMurder of Mallika Jesudasan\nFatal stabbing\nOn 27 May 2012, at their flat in Bukit Batok, 31-year-old Sujay Solomon Sutherson murdered his 56-year-old mother Mallika Jesudasan.\nSheena (aged 31 in 2015), Sujay's sister, last seen her mother alive at 6.30pm when she left the flat to meet a friend, and at that point of time, Mallika was left alone at home with her elder son Sujay. According to Sujay, Mallika asked him for money after they had their dinner on that fateful day, but he turned down her request and proceeded to the kitchen to wash his plate. Sujay said that when he did so, Mallika grabbed his hair and scratched him, and allegedly, Mallika tried to undress her son, wanting to get intimate with him, and this caused Sujay to react by picking up a knife with a blue handle from the kitchen counter and plunged the knife into Mallika's neck. Afterwards, with the knife still embedded in her neck, Mallika staggered back towards her bedroom and tried to reach fo",

    "\nThe Year of the Three Kings\nInstrument of abdication signed by Edward VIII and his three brothers, Albert, Henry and George, 10 December 1936\nOn 12 December 1936, George V was proclaimed king throughout the British Empire after the abdication of his brother Edward VIII following a constitutional crisis as result of the King's desire to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson.\nProclamation\nAt Fort Belvedere, on 10 December, Edward signed his written abdication notices, witnessed by his three younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York (who succeeded Edward as King); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent. The following day, it was given effect by Act of Parliament: His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936.\nThe following day, now being addressed as \"Prince Edward\", the former King gave a speech on BBC Radio explaining his reasons for abdicating, ending his speech with: \"And now, we all have a new King. I wish him and you, his people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. God bless you all. God save the King!\"\nOn December 12, the Accession Council met at St James's Palace to proclaim Prince Albert as King George:\nWhereas by an Instrument of Abdication dated the Tenth day of December instant His former Majesty King Edward the Eighth did declare His irrevocable Determination to renounce the Throne for Himself and His Descendants, and the said Instrument of Abdication has now taken effect, whereby the Imperial Crown of Great Britain, Ireland, and all other His former Majesty's dominions is now solely and rightfully come to the High and Mighty Albert Frederick Arthur George:\nWe, therefore, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of this Realm, being here assisted with these of His former Majesty's Privy Council, with numbers of other Principal Gentlemen of Quality, with the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, and citizens of London, do now hereby, with one Voice and Consent of Tongue and Heart, publish and proclaim, That the High and Mighty PrinceAlbert Frederick Arthur George, is now become our only lawful and rightful Liege Lord George the Sixth by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India: To whom we do acknowledge all Faith and constant Obedience, with all hearty and humble Affection: beseeching God, by whom Kings and Queens do reign, to bless the Royal Prince George the Sixth, with long and happy years to reign over Us.\nGiven at St. James's Palace, this Twelfth day of December in the year of our Lord One thousand nine hundred and thirty-six.\nGOD SAVE THE KING!\nOutside the United Kingdom\nProclamation of the accession of George VI outside Parliament House in Sydney, Australia\nAs the Statute of Westminster 1931 stipulated that the line of succession must remain the same throughout the Crown's realms, the governments of some of the British Dominions\u2014Canada, Australia, the Union of South Africa, and New Zealand\u2014requested and gave their permission for the act to become part of the law of their respective realms.\nThe Canadian parliament later passed the Succession to the Throne Act, 1937 to ratify changes to the rules of succession in Canada and ensure consistency with the changes in the rules then in place in the United Kingdom.

    "\nThe Nishikuma Kofun (\u897f\u9688\u53e4\u58b3)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the Kinryumachi neighborhood of the city of Saga, Saga Prefecture Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1975.\nOverview\nThe Nishikuma Kofun is located on a plateau at the southern foot of the Sefuri mountain range, in the northern part of the Saga Plain. It is a two-tiered circular enpun (\u5186\u58b3)-style tumulus  with a diameter of about 30 meters and a height of about four meters, built in two tiers, and the presence of fukiishi and figurative and cylindrical haniwa has been confirmed. The surrounding area of the tumulus has been eroded by urban encroachment  and farmland.The horizontal-type stone burial chamber is orientated to the west.  The burial chamber is 3.3 meters long, 1.5 meters wide, and 17 meters high, and the surrounding walls are topped with a waist stone at the base, with slightly flattened blocks of stone piled on top of that. Outside the entrance, there is a vestibule side wall that is 2.8 meters long and 1.1 to 1.4 meters wide. All of the stones used are granite, and the interior of the burial chamber is painted with vermilion pigment. The stone sarcophagus inside the burial chamber is made of tuff from Mount Aso, and is placed in the direction of the chamber's main axis. It is 2 meters long, 1.1 meters wide, and 1.3 meters high, and is made of four stone slabs combined, with no bottom stone.The sarcophagus lid has a hipped roof, and there are two ring-shaped rope hanging protrusions on each of its long sides. The edges of the sarcophagus body and lid facing the entrance are engraved with circular and consecutive triangular patterns that leave compass marks, and the parts other than the patterns are painted with vermillion pigment. This tomb had previously been the victim of grave robbery, and only a few grave goods such as armor fragments and iron arrowheads have been excavated. However, judging from the structure of the burial chamber and sarcophagus, it is estimated to have been built around the end of the 5th century.\nThe tumulus is approximately 8.2 kilometers north of Saga Station on the JR Kyushu Nagasaki Main Line.\nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Saga)\nDecorated kofun\n",

The community of Las Trampas, New Mexico was founded the same year. The grant consisted of 28,132 acres (11,385\u00a0ha) of land on the western slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The settlers served as a buffer on the frontiers of New Mexico to fend off Comanche raids. By the mid 19th century the population of the grant area had grown to about 1,500 in nine different farming and ranching settlements.\nThe farming land in the grant was owned by individual settlers and their descendants and could be bought and sold, but most of the land in the grant area was held in common and used for grazing and timber. After the U.S. conquest of New Mexico in 1846, Anglo-American and Hispano land speculators and attorneys used the U.S. legal system to get ownership of the common land. In 1903, the common lands in their entirety were sold to private owners with the settlers on the grant receiving only a pittance of the proceeds. Following legal struggles, the former common lands became part of the Carson National Forest in 1926. Controversies regarding the uses of the land by the descendants of the original settlers continue into the 21st century.\nAlthough not one of the largest land grants, the legal and political history of the Las Trampas Land Grant is illustrative of land grant issues in New Mexico and southern Colorado.\nBackground\nFrom 1692 to 1846, the Spanish and Mexican governments awarded about 300 land grants to individuals, communities, and Pueblo villages in New Mexico and Colorado. After its conquest of New Mexico in the Mexican-American War, the U.S. and New Mexican governments adjudicated and \"confirmed\" (recognized the validity of) 154 of the grants in a long, slow, and corrupt legal process. The size of the confirmed land grants ranged in size from 200 acres (81\u00a0ha) for Ca\u00f1ada Ancha (now a suburb of Santa Fe) to 1,714,765 acres (6,939.41\u00a0km2) for the Maxwell Land Grant on the eastern slope of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains extending northward into Colorado. As a consequence of the adjudication, the original grantees and their descendants, mostly poor Hispano farmers and ranchers, lost about 98 percent of their land to Anglos and Hispano land speculators and attorneys, especially to the members of the influential Santa Fe Ring. Much of the land ended up in publicly owned national forests. As of 2015, about 35 of the community grants in New Mexico continued to function, had boards of trustees, and owned in common about 200,000 acres (810\u00a0km2) of land.\nThe Las Trampas grant\nView of Santa Fe Baldy, in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, from near Las Trampas.\nIn 1751, New Mexico governor Tom\u00e1s V\u00e9lez Cachup\u00edn, awarded the Las Trampas land grant to twelve families who established the village of Las Trampas. The grant was one of the first made by New Mexico to expand the frontiers of New Mexico and protect the colony from raids of Indian tribes, especially the Comanche who both raided and traded with New Mexico. Specifically, the settlers of Las Trampas had the job of shielding Santa Cruz, 17\u00a0mi (27\u00a0km) to the southwest from Comanche raids. Other grants with the same objective were being created. Many of the early settlers were gen\u00edzaros, detribalized Indians with a history of serving as slaves and servants of the Spanish colonists. They were important in the frontier defense of New Mexico. For the gen\u00edzaros, relocation to Las Trampas and other frontier settlements was a means of acquiring land. The village grew despite the danger of Indian attacks and, by 1776, 63 families comprising 278 individuals were residents.\nThe boundaries of Spanish and Mexican grants were often vaguely defined but Las Trampas was later authenticated by the U.S. government to consist of 28,132 acres (11,385\u00a0ha). A durable peace treaty with the Comanche in 1786 permitted additional settlements in the grant area. Elevations in the grant area ranged from 7,300\u00a0ft (2,200\u00a0m) at Las Trampas village to Trampas Peak with an elevation of 12,200\u00a0ft (3,700\u00a0m) Vegetation ranged from pi\u00f1on woodland at the lowest elevations up to tundra at the highest. No weather stations are located in the grant area but nearby Truchas at an elevation of 8,040\u00a0ft (2,450\u00a0m) receives 14.7\u00a0in (370\u00a0mm) annually which makes irrigation important or essential for most crops. By the time of the American conquest of New Mexico in 1846, the population in the grant area is estimated at 1,500 in several settlements in addition to Las Trampas: Ojo Sarco, Romero, El Valle, Diamante, Chamisal, Ojito, Llano and Rodarte.\nThe Las Trampas Land Grant had a typical pattern of land allocation for a grant to a community (rather than to an individual or an Indian tribe).

    "\nGrandma Moses American Primitive was the first popular catalog of works by Grandma Moses by Otto Kallir, published in 1946.\nMoses\u2019 first solo exhibition had taken place in 1940 \"What a Farmwife Painted\", at the Galerie St. Etienne in New York.  It was organized by Louis J. Caldor and Otto Kallir and since that time Kallir himself had become a firm admirer and promoter of the artist's work. He believed the choice of works in the 1940 exhibition \"included many of her early attempts in which her great talent was scarcely recognizable.\"\nKallir decided to make a catalog based on Grandma Moses' own words on the occasion of her 85th birthday in 1945. He chose to add \"American Primitive\" to the title and gave the work the subtitle \"Forty paintings with comments by Grandma Moses - together with her life's history\". He then wrote an essay that partially rejected the \"primitive\" label that he felt responsible for, writing \"It is important, however, not to confuse \u201cprimitive\u201d with \u201cself-taught\u201d artists.\"\nFirst version published by Dryden Press (now Harcourt), 1946\nSecond version by Doubleday, 1947\nLouis Bromfield wrote the introduction, and Hildegard Bachert transcribed interviews with the artist to develop an ego-document that could be illustrated with a selection of paintings that reflected events and scenes from her life. The selection of paintings each accompanied a story from the artist's childhood in her own words. Two of the forty paintings were illustrated in color (Sugaring Off, and Old Oaken Bucket).\nThough the text and formatting were the same, the second edition switched the order of the paintings that accompanied the artist's stories in order to accompany two more color illustrations (The Old Checkered House in 1860, and Early Springtime on the Farm). These were the first published color illustrations of Grandma Moses paintings and they proved so popular that Kallir first registered her paintings with the Copyright Office in Washington and then arranged for large, higher quality prints that were published in 1948 to accommodate demand.\nThe list of 42 paintings follows which were included in both the 1946 and 1947 editions. These paintings were referenced with the acronym \"GMAP\", in Kallir's 1973 catalogue raisonn\u00e9. Since the plate numbers were different but the topic selections were the same, this list is ordered by painting date. Only four paintings were included from the 1940 exhibition.

It is considered as one of the first euphonium concertos. It was commissioned by the National Brass Band Festival with funds from the Arts Council of Great Britain. The concerto is based on the classical form and consists of 3 movements, following the traditional fast\u2013slow\u2013fast structure.\nStructure\nThe movements are as follows:\nModerato\nLento\nCon moto\nThere is quite a number of tempo/mood changes in movements 1\u20132.\nModerato (\u2669=86) \u2014 Tempo primo \u2014 Allegro vivace \u2014 Meno mosso \u2014 Pochissimo meno \u2014 un poco animando \u2014 Pochissimo meno \u2014 Stringendo \u2014 Molto meno (tempo primo) \u2014 Molto accelerando.\nLento (\u2669=58) \u2014 Adagio \u2014 Poco pi\u00f9 moto \u2014 Tranquillo \u2014 Lento \u2014 Adagio \u2014 poco pi\u00f9 moto\nCon moto (\u2669=100\u2013108) \u2014 (\u2669=130)\nProgramme notes\nThe 1972 edition includes the following programme notes.\nThe three-movement structure reflects a classical outlook concerning concertos. Traditionally, this design favours the listener, first in the head, then the heart and finally in the toes. In the first movement, the soloist combines clear strong phrases with gentle melismatic meandering as well as negotiating many acute-angled leaps which justify themselves by enharmonic changes beneath. The slow movement has a long main melody and contains the only cadenza element in the work: two pastoral passages, homage to the mysteriously beautiful Border Country.

    "Military unit\nThe Reserve Force of the People's Liberation Army is the military reserve force of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). It is composed of a trained force of (mostly retired veteran) civilians that retain an inactive military status, and are subject to fast mobilization. in case of wartime or other crises, at which time they are transferred to active duty and their units activated into full service.  \nThe reserve forces are organized as full units with a small number of active servicemen as an organizational skeleton, plus a larger body of reserve officers and soldiers in call-up ready state. Reserve units follow the unified organization of the PLA and are entered into the official PLA TOEs and order of battle. The PLA reserve forces are directly under the leadership of the Central Military Commission (CMC). The National Defense Mobilization Department of the CMC manages the recruitment, unit assignment and mobilization structures. \nHistory\nThe reserve force of the People's Liberation Army of China was originally established with the formalization of the PLA structures in 1955, but was soon abolished in 1957. At the time, the concept of people's war essentially made the Militia into a de facto reserve force, and former PLA servicemen entered the militia as \"cadre militia\" when demobilized.\nIn 1983, the CMC decided to restore a formal PLA reserve force and officially named it the \"People's Liberation Army Reserve Force\", starting with a pilot unit in Jinzhou. In May 1984, the reserve force was included in the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China. Initially, the reserve force was solely infantry units. After the 1990s, it developed into infantry, artillery, armor, engineering, communications, chemical defense and other services. When the People's Liberation Army Reserve Forces were first established, they were under the dual leadership of the military on the one hand, and the local Chinese Communist Party (CCP) committees and local People's Governments on the other. On 10 August 10, 1986, the reserve force was included in the organizational order of battle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the division and regiment-level units of the reserve force were awarded designations and presented with Colours.\nAs part of the 2015 People's Republic of China military reform, from 1 July 2020, the reserve force began to be readjusted from dual military and civilian leadership to CMC leadership.\nA new Reservist Law passed in 2022, and entered into effect on 1 March 2023. It eliminated the dual authority system, and for the first time excluded the Militia from the formal reserve force. The new law established a formal system of \"selection, training, appointment, management, recruitment and retirement\", with an explicit intent of recruiting and retaining a wider range of talents and specialists.\nStructure of the Reserve Force\nOrganization and control\nThe Reservists Law gives the Central Committee of the CCP and the Central Military Commission full and exclusive authority over the Reserve Force, with every department of the CMC having different obligations. The most central of those offices is the National Defense Mobilization Department, which is responsible for assigning reservists to units, and for calling them up when needed. Temporary call-up by Theater Commands seems to be possible for emergencies and disasters, as happened in the aftermath of typhoon Meranti in 2016, or by order of the central command as during the Anhui floods of 2020.\nReserve Service\nMain article: People's Republic of China Military Service Law\nReservists are by law a distinct form of military service status, and the individual reservist status is distinct and independent from belonging to any reserve forces' formation. Before the new revised Military Service Law took effect on October 1, 2021, reserve personnel included four forms: pre-assignment to active forces, incorporation into reserve forces, incorporation into militia organizations for reserve service, and other forms of reserve service, a very wide definition. The new Reserve Service Law of 2022 define reservists exclusively to PRC citizens 18 and older who are \"preassigned\" to active duty units or are assigned to reserve units. That means that only those pre-registered, with a predetermined obligation to join a specific unit when mobilized, are classified as reserve personnel, thus excluding the militia.\nThe law also specified that reservists include both enlisted and officers, specifying that reserve officers can only be of company or field grade. There are no reserve general officers, meaning that the higher leadership of larger reserve units has to be active service staff assigned to the skeletal units.\nSelection and Recruitment\nBefore the 2022 reforms, reserve officers were mainly selected from qualified veterans, local cadres, people's armed cadres, militia cadres, and technical personnel with local and military occupations.

    "Castle in Kanzaki, Saga, Japan\nAnegawa Castle (\u59c9\u5ddd\u57ce, Anegawa-j\u014d) was a hirayama-style Japanese castle located in the city of Kanzaki, Saga Prefecture, on the island of Kyushu, Japan. During the Sengoku period, it was the stronghold of Ry\u016bz\u014dji Takanobu. The castle site has been a National Historic Site since 2010.\nHistory\nAnegawa Castle was located on the left bank of the Nakachie River, which flows through the eastern part of the Saga Plain, in an alluvial plain about three meters above sea level, in a rice paddy field area. It is a unique castle with a settlement-like structure, protected primarily by a network of moats. It was built by the Kikuchi clan around 1360, and later became the castle of a cadet branch, the Anegawa clan. During the Sengoku period, it was subordinate to the Ry\u016bz\u014dji clan, and was abandoned after Toyotomi Hideyoshi's conquered Kyushu from 1586 to 1587. The fortifications measure about 800 meters north-to-south and 550 meters east-to-west, and consists of many islands separated by water moats. The extent of the fortifications gradually grew from the 14th century to the latter half of the 16th century.  On the island that was the inner bailey, the remains of a boat dock and earthworks can be seen, and excavated remains of post-hole buildings, bridges, wells, and other structures have been unearthed. The castle ruins are about a ten-minute drive from Kanzaki Station on the JR Kyushu Nagasaki Main Line. \nAlthough it is a national historic site, it has not been particularly maintained, and the islands that were once enclosures are now farmland, housing sites, temple grounds, and shrine grounds. However, the remains of the moats remain extensive.\nLiterature\nBenesch, Oleg and Ran Zwigenberg (2019). Japan's Castles: Citadels of Modernity in War and Peace.

    "Earthquake in Iran\nThe 1947 Dustabad earthquake, also known as the Charmeh earthquake, occurred in South Khorasan Province of northeastern Iran on 23 September. The mainshock had a magnitude of Mw 6.9 and maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). It was accompanied by a Mw\u202f 6.1 aftershock on 26 September. These earthquakes killed an estimated 500 people.\nTectonic setting\nIran is situated within the Alpide belt, an active orogenic belt that spans the entire country. This tectonic environment is influenced by the oblique collision of the Arabian and Eurasian Plates at an estimated rate of 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) annually. Iran is situated on the Eurasian Plate, where it hosts complex zones of faults, forming tectonic blocks within the country. In southeastern Iran, the Arabian Plate subducts beneath Iran along the Makran Trench. Shallow strike-slip and reverse faulting accommodate deformation in eastern Iran. Crustal shortening and thickening occur at fold and thrust belts along the Zagros, Alborz, and Kopet Dag ranges. Intraplate deformation occur, mainly displaying reverse faulting at the southern and northern parts of Iran to accommodate the convergence via crustal uplift and strike-slip faulting at the east and western ends where the Arabian Plate slides past the adjacent crust. The tectonic setting contributes to shallow seismicity. South of latitude 34\u00b0, north\u2013south trending dextral strike-slip faults occur in response to local dextral shear in the Dasht-e-Lut as central Iran moves northward relative to western Afghanistan. Sinistral strike-slip structures oriented east\u2013west accommodes that deformation north of that latitude.\nEarthquake\nThe 23 September earthquake struck north of the Daqq-e-Muhammadabad, a small basin, where there are several north\u2013south striking dextral faults. A 1982 report documented by Ambraseys and Melville, around 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) of weathered surface faulting along one of these faults, known as the Dustabad Fault (also known as Chang Raqsh Fault), discovered in 1978, approximately 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) east of the computed epicenter location. The surface rupture documented produced up to 1\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) and 30\u201380\u00a0cm (12\u201331\u00a0in) of dextral and dip-slip displacements, respectively. Local residents also alleged that the surface rupture extended further north to Ishtakhr. Walker et al. stated that as the documentation occurred over 30 years following the earthquake, these features may not actually be associated with the 23 September 1947 mainshock. This also supported by global seismic data, through in poor quality, which did not support the idea of an epicenter along the Dustabad Fault.\nAnother set of northwest\u2013southeast trending ground fractures was reported between Badamak and Gurab-e Jadid for about 6\u00a0km (3.7\u00a0mi). Its location coincided with the Ferdows Thrust fault's southeastern portion. This region is characterised by folded and thrusted molasse deposits from the Neogene. Berberian suggested that both aforementioned literatures did not account for the 26 September aftershock. As the Dustabad Fault is too short to produce an earthquake of comparable magnitude as the 23 September earthquake, it was likely the source of the aftershock. Destruction was also reported along the north\u2013south trend of the fault. Meanwhile, the 23 September earthquake may have been produced along the Ferdows Thrust and levelled villages along its strike. Dustabad-e Bala experienced total devastation by the two earthquakes as it was located southwest of the Ferdows Thrust and north of the Dustabad Fault.\nImpact\nThe earthquake affected a sparsely populated region where most population centers were remote and small desert settlements. The total number of deaths is unknown as some villages confirmed fatalities but did not provide figures, though at least 500 people were killed. The affected region was constrained to within a 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) by 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi), oval-shaped area oriented north-northwest\u2013south-southeast. Small settlements were destroyed and in the villages of Charmeh and Sarayan, there were eight and two deaths, respectively. Two hundred people died and another 100 were injured in Dustabad-e Bala; further devastation occurred to the southeast and there was also damage in Ferdows. The maximum Modified Mercalli intensity exceeded VIII (Severe) in seven villages including Badamuk, Bostaq, Charmeh, Dustabad-e Bala, Estakhr, Gurab-e Jadid and M\u0101rkuh. Along with effects of the 26 September aftershock, Dustabad-e Bala was totally razed and most casualties were reported there. In Tighab, which was damaged by both events and three people died, the aftershock exceeded VII (Very strong).\nSee also\nList of earthquakes in 1947\nList of earthquakes in Iran\n",
    "\nLouise Elisabeth (Wies) van Groningen (n\u00e9e Louise Metaal) (15 March 1929 \u2013 30 December 2022), was a Moluccan Dutch writer and story collector. She was active in the Black, migrant and refugee women's movement (zwarte, migranten- en vluchtelingenvrouwen (ZMV) in Dutch) and in the Dutch Moluccan and Indonesian community. Her aim was to improve information for and about ZMV women. She wrote many stories about her ancestors, and encouraged Dutch Indonesian and Moluccan women and men to record the life stories of their ancestors.\nEarly life, education and family\nLouise Elizabeth Metaal, (known as Wies) was born on 15 March 1929 in Blangkejeren, Sumatra, in the Dutch East Indies, daughter of a Moluccan mother, Clara Hukom and a Dutch Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) soldier, Barend Nicolaas Jacobus Metaal. She was the second in a family of four children. The family moved with her father's military job and they lived in Batavia, Tjimahi, and Bandung. In 1939, whilst on leave in the Netherlands, her parents decided that because of the impending war, her mother and the children would be better off staying in the Netherlands until her father had completed his last year of service in the East Indies. They settled in Delft, in South Holland. Then the Second World War broke out and Japan occupied the Dutch East Indies. Her father died as a prisoner of war in 1942 as a result of the Dutch East Indies campaign. The family assimilated into the local community in Delft, with little contact with other Moluccan people. The young Wies found this life very strict. At the age of 17, she was shocked to hear her mother speak Malay to some visitors, and didn't understand what she was saying.\nWies Metaal earned an HBS-A degree and worked in the library of Delft University of Technology for a few years. She married Frans Popko van Groningen in 1953 and had four children. She took the name Wies van Groningen. She later attended the PABO-Beeldende Vorming and then taught at a number of primary schools in Utrecht before taking early retirement. In 1973 she travelled through Indonesia with her mother and recalled thinking \"I know this, I'm home\".\nWomen's movement: Black, migrant and refugee women\nAfter her early retirement, van Groningen joined the Vrouwenbibliotheek Utrech (Women's Library Utrecht) in 1988. Here, she had a clear goal in mind: to improve the provision of information for and about Black, migrant and refugee women.\nShe put significant effort into making the collection visible and accessible in the field of ZMVV women. She made many proposals for improving the Women's Thesaurus (a list of terms/keywords to search by subject). In the field of white women's emancipation, this system was a huge improvement on \u2018regular\u2019 keyword systems, but often proved unsuitable for information about ZMV women. Wies was an active participant in the national working group working on improving the Women's Thesaurus, exposing blind spots and working to find solutions. She also ensured an increased budget for this part of the collection. She was a member of the supervisory committee of the International Information Centre and Archive for the Women's Movement (IIAV)'s project \u201cInformation on Black, Migrant and Refugee Women\u201d from 1992 to 1995.\nWriting and collecting stories\nWies van Groningen started writing at the age of 60. Awareness of what she described as her \u2018double blood\u2019, which she learnt about through stories from her mother, brought her into the Moluccan community in the 1990s. In 1992 she visited her mother's family home in Oma. She published her first collection in 1995, featuring stories from her mother, Clara Hukom. She elaborated the story further in her autobiographical story Is militair-is militair.\nAround 1998, Wies van Groningen switched from the Women's Library Utrecht, to Museum Maluku, the Moluccan Historical Museum. There, she focused on recording women's history, especially that of Moluccan women. In partnership with Christien Hetharia, she interviewed twenty Moluccan women, and published the interviews in Holland ligt niet dicht bij de hemel (Holland is not close to heaven). The women interviewed were Susette Huwae, Coos Ayal, Jossy Keiluhu, Salomina (Mien) Sapuletej-Lawalata, Anna Bathseba de Fretes-Rehatta, Netty Batawangge-Tamonob, Naomi Lawalata-Usmany, Augustien Souisa, Cisca Pattipilohy, Nona Matulessy, Annet Rahantoknam, Farida Pattisahusiwa, Colette Voorwinde, Fientje de Kock-Hully, Monica Akihary, Johanna Tomasowa-Tapilaha.\nAt the Moluccan Historical Museum, she was active in collecting stories of Moluccan women and men in a project called Meer dan een verhaal (More than a story). A public appeal was made inviting people to send in short stories about their Moluccan grandparents. Many stories were submitted and two collections of short stories were published, Meer dan een verhaal and Luister naar mijn verhaal. In 2010, van Groningen led the publication of Pasar Cerita a new collection of stories with mem",
    "\nThe Pla de Barcelona derby (Catalan: derbi del Pla de Barcelona), also known as the rivalry of La Vila contra El Poble, is the football rivalry between CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. Europa, from the Vila de Gr\u00e0cia, and Sant Andreu, from Sant Andreu del Palomar, are the main clubs from the former towns of the Pla de Barcelona (Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain). Throughout history, many matches between these two clubs have been played, even though the supporters of both sides consider 2007 the year when the rivalry was born.\nDuel between players of CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu\nSymbols\nNicknames\nOn the one hand, the players and supporters of CE Europa are known by three nicknames: europeistes (because of the name of the club), graciencs (demonym of the Vila de Gr\u00e0cia), and escapulats. This latter nickname is a reference to the design of the shirt of Europa: a blue chevron (in Catalan: escapulari) over a white basis.\nOn the other hand, the persons related to UE Sant Andreu are known by two nicknames: andreuencs (the demonym of Sant Andreu de Palomar) and quadribarrats (\"those with four bars\"), a reference to the shirt of Sant Andreu: four red bars over a yellow background, inspired on the flag of Catalonia.\nStadiums\nThroughout history, both clubs have played in different stadiums. Europa has played its home matches in the neighbourhoods of el Camp de l'Arpa, la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, el Camp d'en Grassot, el Baix Guinard\u00f3, Vilapicina, and the Vila de Gr\u00e0cia, while all of the stadiums of Sant Andreu have always been located at the same place, concretely in Sant Andreu de Palomar. Currently, the stadium of Europa is the Nou Sardenya, whereas Sant Andreu plays its home matches at the Narc\u00eds Sala.\nColours\nEven though the designs of the shirts of the clubs have varied over the years, Europa and Sant Andreu have maintained the same colours during most of their histories. Europa has always played with a white-blue shirt, while Sant Andreu started playing with a white and red stripes, then changed the white stripes to yellow, after which it had to change the red stripes to blue because of the beginning of the Francoist dictatorship. Since the 1940s, the club plays with red and yellow stripes.\nHistory\nEvolution of the rivalry\nThe first matches between Europa and Sant Andreu were played in the last years of the 1900s and the beginning of the 1910s, but due to the lack of clear and consistent documentation, it is not known exactly how many matches were played between the teams. Moreover, there is no evidence of the existence of a significant rivalry in this era.\nDuring most of the 20th century, there have been isolated moments of tension between the supporters of both teams, but the rivalry was not considered to be more intense than that with other teams from the Pla de Barcelona, such as UE Sants, UA Horta, or FC Martinenc. However, during the 1980s and 1990s, the relationship between the clubs' fanbases worsened, followed by a period of less rivalry.\nGenerally, 2007 is considered the year of the start of the rivalry that is still alive. Since the 2020s, this derby is considered the second-most intense derby of Catalonia after the derbi barcelon\u00ed, both because of incidents between the supporter groups of both clubs and because of the lack of direct confrontations between other Catalan rivals, such as the derby of the Vall\u00e8s Occidental (CE Sabadell FC versus Terrassa FC) or the Camp derby (N\u00e0stic de Tarragona versus Reus Deportiu).\nCurrent rivalry\nCurrently, the derby is characterized by the similar social and political profiles of Europa and Sant Andreu. Both clubs are openly antifascist and defend the use of the Catalan language, values that are shared by their fan groups. Moreover, both are sports entities that represent formerly independent towns, currently neighbourhoods of Barcelona, annexed by the Catalan city in 1897. Europa and Sant Andreu are also considered neighbourhood clubs, football clubs with relatively cheap match tickets, close contact between players and supporters, and an active social role in the neighbourhood to which they belong.\nLeague confrontations\nSummary\nComparison\n",

He currently serves as the mayor of Lethbridge, Alberta. \nEarly life and education\nHyggen is the son of Lola \"Dodie\" and Larry Hyggen, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nHyggen was educated at Lethbridge Community College where he took Business Law and Accounting.\nHe is the owner of Copy Express.\nCity council\nHyggen ran for Lethbridge City Council in the 2007 and 2010 municipal elections before finally getting elected in the 2013 Lethbridge municipal election. He was re-elected in the 2017 Lethbridge municipal election. While serving on council, he put forward a successful proposal to rename the Adams Ice Centre to the Logan Boulet Arena after the ice hockey player from the city that was killed in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash. He was less successful when he brought a proposal to call on the provincial government to pull funding for a supervised drug-consumption facility in the city. He stated that he heard that users were being given \"goody bags and chocolates\", which the mayor rebuked.\nMayoralty\nAfter the city's mayor Chris Spearman announced he would not be running for re-election in the 2021 municipal election, Hyggen announced in June of that year that he was going to run for the city's top job. In his announcement he stated that \"I've been a fighter for the people of Lethbridge both fiscally and socially, the kind of guy not afraid to use common sense as a benchmark in decisions.\" He also stated that as mayor, he would be \"fiscally responsible, increase the availability of affordable housing, ensure sustainable development, improve the efficiency of city operations, and come up with a plan to build a third bridge to the west side\" and that safety was his number one priority.\nOn election day, Hyggen was elected as mayor, defeating former councillor and daughter of former MLA Bridget Pastoor, Bridget Mearns by just over 500 votes. After winning election he stated his first priority would be to \"reach out to the other members of Lethbridge council\" to find out their opinions.\nIn 2022, he was criticized for a Tweet which shared a link from The Daily Sceptic stating 'There is No Climate Emergency'\". He later declared that the article \"does not reflect my personal beliefs\".\nIn 2024, he stated that water conservation would be the top priority for the city, due to a lack of snowpack in the nearby mountains which feeds into the city's water system.\nIn 2024, he and council announced their support for the city to bid on hosting the 2026 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, Canada's national women's curling championship. The city had also unsuccessfully bid for the 2025 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials.\n",
    "History of Malawi\nFlag of Nyasaland (1925\u20131964)\nThe political history of Malawi spans over a century. Malawi, then Nyasaland, effectively became a one-party state in August 1961, when the country held its first general elections, and the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) led by Hastings Kamuzu Banda became the dominant force. This status was formalized in 1966 when the constitution declared the MCP the sole legitimate political party. However, in 1993, the constitution was amended to introduce a multiparty system, paving the way for the emergence of new political parties. The United Democratic Front (UDF) quickly rose to prominence, and since then, other parties have also gained ground. The constitution guarantees all citizens aged 18 and above the right to participate in the political process, including the right to run for public office. Women and minority groups have made significant strides in Malawian politics, holding various positions in the National Assembly, cabinet, and judiciary, and contributing to the country's political landscape.\nHistory\nEarly years (1890s-1964)\nBritish colonial rule\nMalawi was a British colony, known as Nyasaland, from 1891 to 1964. The colonial era saw the exploitation of Malawi's natural resources and the suppression of local cultures and traditions. The British exploited Malawi's natural resources, including tobacco, tea, and sugar, and imposed their own language, culture, and political systems.\nResistance and nationalism\nMalawians resisted colonial rule, with various uprisings and protests. The Malawi Congress Party (MCP) was formed in 1959, led by Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda, to fight for independence.\nOccurrences in Nyasaland\nFlag of Nyasaland (1925\u20131964)\nThe current flag of Malawi, the then Nyasaland, after independence\nHarvesting coffee in Nyasaland\nNyasaland stamps in 1949\nStamp of Nyasaland 1913\nThe Rhodesia & Nyasaland \u00a35 note, printed in 1957.\nIndependence era (1964-1994)\nIndependence\nThe Malawi Congress Party (MCP) was formed in 1959, led by Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda, to fight for independence. Malawi gained independence on July 6, 1964, with Dr. Banda as its first president.\nOne-party state\nIn 1971, Banda declared Malawi a one-party state, making the MCP the only legal party. Opposition was suppressed, and dissent was not tolerated. The MCP became the dominant party, and Banda ruled with an iron fist, suppressing opposition and dissent.\nHuman rights abuses\nBanda's regime was notorious for human rights abuses, including forced labor, political imprisonment, and torture.\nMultiparty era (1994-2019)\nDemocratic reforms\nIn 1993, Malawi adopted a new constitution, allowing for multiparty democracy.\nFirst multiparty elections\nThe 1994 elections saw the United Democratic Front (UDF), led by Bakili Muluzi, win a majority. The United Democratic Front (UDF), led by Bakili Muluzi, won the 1994 elections, ending the MCP's dominance.\nPolitical instability\nThe 1990s and 2000s saw frequent changes in government, with allegations of corruption and political interference. Muluzi served two terms, followed by Bingu wa Mutharika (UDF) and Joyce Banda (People's Party).\nEconomic struggles\nMalawi faced significant economic challenges, including poverty, inflation, and dependence on foreign aid.\nCurrent era (2019-present)\nControversial elections\nThe 2019 elections saw Peter Mutharika (Democratic Progressive Party) win amidst allegations of fraud and irregularities.\nPolitical tensions\nThe MCP, now led by Lazarus Chakwera, has become a major opposition force. The opposition MCP challenged the election results, leading to ongoing political tensions.\nEconomic struggles\nMalawi remains one of the poor countries in the world, facing significant development challenges.\n",
    "Upcoming concert by Kendrick Lamar\nThe Pop Out: Ken & Friends, or simply The Pop Out, is an upcoming one-off concert by the American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It is scheduled to be held at Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, on June 19, 2024. A Juneteenth celebration, it will be Lamar's first major performance after his highly publicized feud with the Canadian rapper Drake concluded.\nBackground\nFurther information: Drake\u2013Kendrick Lamar feud\nOn March 22, 2024, American rapper Kendrick Lamar reignited his decade-long feud with Canadian rapper Drake. Lamar unexpectedly appeared on Future and Metro Boomin's single \"Like That\" to diss Drake and J. Cole for their 2023 single \"First Person Shooter\". A critical and commercial success, \"Like That\" topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for three consecutive weeks.\nThroughout April and May, Lamar and Drake exchanged various diss tracks aimed at the opposing party and other artists who were involved in their conflict, such as Future, Metro, ASAP Rocky, Rick Ross, and The Weeknd. Drake's arsenal included \"Push Ups\", \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" (which has since been removed), and \"Family Matters\", while Lamar's featured \"Euphoria\", \"6:16 in LA\", and \"Meet the Grahams\". As time passed, the allegations both rappers utilized against their opponent grew more severe. After Lamar released \"Not Like Us\", which marked his second Hot 100 chart-topper of 2024, Drake reportedly conceded with \"The Heart Part 6\". Journalists who analyzed the feud reached a general verdict in Lamar's favor.\nThe Pop Out: Ken & Friends was surprise announced by Lamar on June 5, 2024, as his first major performance following the feud. Presented by the creative agencies PGLang and Free Lunch, the \"victory lap\" celebration is titled after a lyric from \"Not Like Us\" (\"Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas\") and coincides with Juneteenth. Its sponsors include Cash App, Gin & Juice, and Visa. The promotional poster for the event, which premiered alongside the announcement, is a motor vehicle sporting an airbrushed mural depicting roses, a pair of dice, and praying hands; its license plate lists the show details. Mustard, who produced \"Not Like Us\", confirmed that he will appear at the concert on June 7, by sharing his customized plate to X (formerly Twitter).\nTicket sales\nTicket sales for the Pop Out were primarily handled by Ticketmaster, although some sales occurred on other ticketing agencies. Cash App cardholders enjoyed presale access on June 6, due to Lamar's partnership with the payment service. Met with a \"staggering high\" demand, tickets sold out instantly after they went on sale to the general public the following day. Some social media users who waited in the queue area shared that they were in line behind over 100,000 prospective buyers. Confirmed prices were reportedly affordable; however, scalpers and bots purchased tickets in bulk and listed them on resale platforms, resulting in exacerbated fees. On Ticketmaster, resale options ranged between $350 to $1,500 for a single seat.\nAmazon Music broadcast\nHours after the general sale commenced, Amazon Music announced that the Pop Out will be live-streamed on Prime Video and the music streaming platform's Twitch channel starting at 4 p.m. PT. The livestream is part of Amazon Music's \"Forever the Influence\" initiative, which celebrates the contributions of Black artists, producers, and songwriters who have \"shaped cultural landscapes\" throughout Black Music Month.\n",
    "American athlete and coach\nGeorge Wood Canterbury (February 25, 1878 \u2013 June 2, 1954) was an American ice hockey player and coach for the Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey team.\nEarly life\nCanterbury was born in Boston on February 25, 1878, to William Headly and Helen Homer (Pierce) Canterbury. He prepared for college at the Hopkinson School in Boston.\nPlaying\nDuring his youth, Canterbury played shinny on Hammond and Jamaica Ponds. At the Hopkinson School, Canterbury played another informal version of hockey known as ice polo. From 1898 to 1901, Canterbury was a forward on the Harvard hockey team. Canterbury graduated from Harvard College in 1901, but continued to play amateur hockey for the Brae Burn Country Club, Boston Hockey Club, and Boston Athletic Association. Early on in his amateur career, Canterbury was asked to fill-in at goaltender and remained at that position until his retirement in 1914.\nCoaching\nCanterbury began coaching Harvard's goaltenders in 1913. He replaced Fred Rocque as the head coach of the Boston Athletic Association hockey team in 1923 and remained with the club until it folded after the 1925\u201326 season. In 1941, Canterbury was replaced on the Harvard coaching staff by Fred V. Maloon Jr. On January 15, 1942, Harvard athletic director W. J. Bingham fired Maloon and head coach Clark Hodder after several members of the hockey team caused a disturbance during a Christmas trip to Lake Placid, New York. John Chase was brought in to replaced Hodder and Canterbury returned as assistant coach. During the 1942\u201343 seasons, Canterbury was the freshman and junior varsity coach while also instructing the goaltenders.\nAutomobile sales\nIn 1906, Canterbury began a career in automobile sales with the Harry Fosdick Company. From 1907 to 1914, he sold Stevens-Duryea cars for the J. W. Bowman Company. In 1914, he formed George W. Canterbury Inc., which served as the New England agency for the Simplex Automobile Company. In 1920, the company became the eastern New England distributor for Stevens-Duryea and moved from Boylston Street to Commonwealth Avenue. That year, George W. Canterbury Inc. ran the Stevens-Duryea and Brewster & Co. exhibitions at the Boston Auto Show. By 1922, Canterbury was a Winton dealer. In 1923, he formed the Boston Overland Company and began selling Willys\u2013Overland and Willys-Knight vehicles. In 1928, his dealership closed and he joined C. E. Fay Co. as a special representative. He left the following year to become a branch manager for Duesenberg.\nPersonal life\nOn June 8, 1908, Canterbury married Adelaide Merrill Gay in Brookline, Massachusetts. They had two sons (George Jr. and William) as well as a daughter (Gertrude) who died at the age of two. The family lived in Brookline, but later moved to Hingham, Massachusetts, where Canterbury was the harbormaster for many years. Canterbury died on June 2, 1954, at South Shore Hospital.\nCanterbury Society\nIn the 1930s, Harvard goaltender Dave Mittell created the Canterbury Society, an informal social club for past and present Harvard goalies which he named in honor of the school's longtime coach. The society sponsored the George W. Canterbury Award, which was presented annually to the top goaltender in the Ivy League.\n",
    "In 2018, voters in the U.S. state of Georgia approved a constitutional amendment to create a business court for all of Georgia.  After an enabling statute to create the Georgia State-wide Business Court was enacted in 2019, the court became operational in 2020.\nHistory\nIn November 2017, the State of Georgia Court Reform Council issued a report to Georgia's Governor Nathan Deal recommending creation of a statewide business court, with jurisdiction over matters involving a wide range of business and commercial disputes.  Among the many case types listed, such as contracts and business torts, there are also specific references to disputes involving antitrust law, intellectual property law, cybersecurity and biotechnology, as well as international arbitration disputes.\nAmong other things, the report considered the success of the Metro Atlanta Business Case Division (associated with the Fulton County Superior Court) in making its recommendation for a statewide court, and concluded that creating a new statewide court as a distinct court, and not a subdivision of an existing court, required amending Georgia's Constitution.\nArticle VI of Georgia's Constitution was amended in 2018 to create a statewide business court, with the final approval being given by Georgia's voters. In 2019, the law creating the Georgia State-wide Business Court went into effect, and the court became operational in 2020.\nDetails\nThe State-wide Business Court has the authority to hear seventeen types of cases listed in the governing statute, with the powers of a court of equity over all of those case types. If those case types only involve claims for money damages, however, the claim must be worth at least $1,000,000 if it involves commercial real property, or at least $500,000 for those permitted case types not involving disputes over commercial real property.\nThe court may be located in Atlanta or Macon-Bibb County, but its jurisdiction is statewide. This law establishing the State-wide Business Court's existence and jurisdiction makes clear that the Metro Atlanta Business Case Division may continue to separately exist, and other Georgia superior courts or state courts may have the ability to create business court divisions.\nAll parties to a case must consent to the State-wide Business Court's jurisdiction.  A party may request a jury trial.\nThe State-wide Business Court has its own rules and forms. It has only one judge and one division. The judge is appointed by the Governor, subject to certain legislative approvals. By contrast, under Article VI, Section VII, of Georgia's constitution, superior and state court judges are elected. As of 2022, the State-wide Business Court judge is paid $174,500, the same as a Court of Appeals judge, whereas Georgia's (trial level) superior court judges are paid $126,265.\nWalter W. Davis was appointed as the first State-wide Business Court judge in 2019. The current State-wide Business Court judge (as of June 2024) is William Grady Hamrick, III, who replaced Judge Davis and has served since September 2022.\n",

    "Cemetery located in Rh\u00f4ne, in France\nThe Jewish cemetery of Lyon, also called the Israelite Cemetery of Gerland or de la Mouche, is a Jewish cemetery located in Gerland, in the 7th arrondissement of Lyon, France. It is the only Jewish burial site in the city.\nHistory\nWhile 32 Jewish tombs were found in a crypt underneath the H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Lyon, the real cemetery was founded by a decision from the revolutionary government in 1795.\nIn 1992, the cemetery was vandalized for the first time. In 2004, 60 tombs of the cemetery were vandalized with Hitler's name, celtic cross and swastikas. The perpetrator was believed to be a mentally ill man who supported far-right politics. Jewish authorities and the French government expressed their dismay at the incident. Notably, local authorities were given \"instructions to find the culprits of this odious act\". Additionally, Interior Minister Dominique de Villepin, declared that the \"determination of public authorities to combat against all antisemitic acts will not be wavered\". The Cardinal of Lyon, Philippe Barbarin, equally expressed his \"total solidarity and  full support to the Jewish community affected by this ignoble antisemitic act\".\nWhile there are other Jewish cemeteries in the Lyon region, including Cimeti\u00e8re de Cusset in Villeurbanne, and the cemetery in Champagne-au-Mont-d'Or, this Jewish cemetery is the only Jewish cemetery in the city of Lyon and, with the Jewish cemetery of La Boisse in l'Ain, is administered by the Israelite Central Consistory of Lyon.\nDescription\nMap of the cemetery\nLocated on Rue Abraham-Bloch in the Gerland neighborhood of the city, the cemetery covers an area of 7000 square meters and includes 4900 tombs which were inventoried in a study published in 2003. It opens with a black portal bearing four golden stars of David.\nAt the center is a monument to the memories of Jewish soldiers who fell in the line of duty and Jews who were deported from France during the Holocaust. The cemetery is closed on Saturdays and Jewish holidays.\nCelebrations\nEach year shortly before Rosh Hashanah the cemetery holds a \"ceremony of remembrance for martyrs and victims of Nazi barbarism\". The Chief Rabbi of Lyon presides over the ceremony which honor the memory of those deported, killing and those deprived of burial. It notably bears the memory of former Chief Rabbi of Lyon Abraham Bloch (1859\u20131914), killed during the First World War while giving a crucifix to a dying Catholic soldier who mistook him for a priest. The gesture is considered one of the most fervent expressions of respect for a belief other than ones own.\nBibliography\n\u00c9tienne Troller, Manuela Wyler, Relev\u00e9 du cimeti\u00e8re juif de la Mouche (Lyon), Cercle de g\u00e9n\u00e9alogie juive, 2003, ISBN\u00a02-912785-24-3\nDominique Bertin (15 April 2013).

    "Indian comedian and actor (born 1957)\nDomingos Gabriel \"Domnic\" Coelho (born 24 March 1957), popularly known as Comedian Domnic or Hoddo Bakru (transl.\u2009Bald Landlord), is an Indian comedian, actor, singer, playwright, and theatre director known for his work in Konkani films and tiatr productions.\nEarly life\nDomingos Gabriel Coelho was born on 24 March 1957, in Bandora, Goa. At the time, Goa was part of Portuguese India, during the Portuguese Empire. Coelho was born into a Goan Catholic family as the third of six children: Luis (born 1962), Antonio (born 1964), Roque (born 1966), Ana (born 1952), Rosa (born 1959), and Inacio (born 1953). His parents were Caetano Coelho, a farmer, and Florinda (later Florina) Costa, a homemaker from Chicalim, Goa. During his time as a school student, Coelho, in his theatrical premiere, assumed the primary comedic role in a one-act play entitled Pope Babli Mumbai. After receiving a warm reception from the audience, Coelho was motivated to extend his acting endeavors. Subsequently, he engaged in tiatrs, a customary type of Goan theater, at the community level in nearby villages.\nCareer\nCoelho's entry into the professional tiatr theater scene occurred later in his career compared to many of his contemporaries. While the majority of tiatrists embark on their stage careers during their youth, Coelho's initial performance on the professional tiatr stage occurred circa 1990 when he was 33 years old. During that era, the majority of tiatrs featured artists predominantly hailing from the regions of Bardez and Salcete. Prior to this professional debut, Coelho had participated in annual natak (dramatic performance) productions in the late 1970s. He subsequently shifted his focus to creating and overseeing the production of his own tiatrs, which were showcased during the yearly celebration in his native village of Muxer-Bandora, Goa situated in the Ponda taluka area. Coelho's talent caught the eye of a relative named Jackferns, who was a tiatr contractor, promoter, and businessman based in Vasco da Gama, Goa. Jackferns facilitated an introduction between Coelho and the established tiatrist Manuel Pereira, which resulted in Coelho securing a role in Pereira's 1986 tiatr production named Ghorabo (Family). Coelho engaged in two of Pereira's theatrical shows before assuming a role in Patrick Dourado's 1988 tiatr production named Nomoskar (Greetings). In addition to his initial professional experiences, Coelho took on acting roles for well-known tiatrists like Anthony San. Following this, he initiated the production of his independent commercial tiatr shows, debuting with Tum Pasun (You Too) in the year 1992.\nCoelho had an extensive career in tiatr productions, in the post-1990s period, wherein he performed in tiatrs directed by some of the popular Konkani stage directors, including Patrick Dourado, Jose Rod, Prince Jacob, Roseferns, Menino de Bandar, Chris Perry, Mariano Fernandes, and John D' Silva, among others. Coelho's portrayal of the comedic character \"Hoddo Bakru\" in the tiatr Mauli (Gardener) directed by Jose Rod was particularly well received. The comedic persona, a thrifty landlord character known as a \"bhatcar,\" typically seen seated in his armchair on his \"balcao\" or veranda, is famous for engaging in frequent quarrels with neighbors over minor matters, had become so well known that the nickname 'Hoddo Bakru' is now a lasting moniker for Coelho. Coelho's artistic endeavors extend beyond the stage, encompassing roles in a variety of VCDs (video compact discs) and full-length feature films, apart from managing the production and direction of his personal VCDs. \"Since 1999, he founded his own theatrical group where he has taken on roles as a playwright, director, and producer of tiatrs that frequently examine family themes and deliver strong messages to the audience,\" writes Elvis Sequeira of O Heraldo. These productions are infused with humor, showcasing the lively on-stage chemistry between Coelho and his brother, Luis Bachan, who is also a popular Konkani stage comedian.\nIn October 2010, Coelho's tiatr Novo Suria Udetana was launched towards the end of the month. He has staged his theatrical productions both domestically and internationally over the course of his career. Coelho has performed his works extensively abroad, touring countries such as Portugal, Germany, France, Canada, the United Kingdom, and various nations in the Persian Gulf region on multiple occasions. Additionally, he has entertained audiences in various regions across multiple states in his homeland of India. In May 2016, Coelho collaborated with his brother Luis Bachan to debut a new tiatr called Ami Soglim Ek (We Are One). This theatrical presentation celebrated the roles of a housewife and a young girl child, a theme that marked a significant production in the tiatr oeuvre of Coelho, his 20th production. The ensemble cast included Priscilla as Joyce, portraying the housewife, Sonali as a childlike character,",
    "German-Australian political scientist and geographer\nTobias Ide is a German-Australian political scientist and geographer. He is currently Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at Murdoch University in Perth and Specially Appointed Professor of Peace and Sustainability at Hiroshima University. Ide is well known for his research on climate security and environmental peacebuilding. He also consults decision makers, for instance at the United Nations, World Bank, and NATO.\nResearch\nIde has worked extensively on the impacts of climate change and conflict risks. In several studies, he showed that climate-related disasters increase the risk of protests, armed conflict onset, and civil war escalation. However, he argues that this does not happen always and automatically, but only if certain context factors are present. These include the political exclusion of ethnic groups, low levels of development, a weakening of the government, and unsuitable government responses to the disaster. He finds similar patterns when analysing conflicts about renewable resources. In his 2023 book Catastrophes, Confrontations, and Constraints, Ide argues that disasters can also lead to temporary reductions in conflict intensity by weakening the conflict parties. Such time periods provide windows of opportunity for aid delivery and conflict resolution.\nFurthermore, Ide has conducted widely cited research on environmental peacebuilding. He demonstrated that water and conservation cooperation between states can support already existing reconciliation efforts, drawing on examples like the Lempa River and the Virunga National Park. He also argues that environmental cooperation contributes to peacebuilding within countries by improving the environmental situation, increasing trust and understanding, and building shared institutions. Such efforts can contribute to local and everyday peace if relevant institutions support the efforts and there is widespread agreement on the nature and urgency of environmental problems.\nIde has coined the concept of the \u201cdark side of environmental peacebuilding\u201d, by which he refers to six potential adverse effects of environmental peacebuilding efforts:\ndepoliticization (of underlying conflict drivers),\n(unvoluntary) displacement of people (e.g., by cooperative dam projects),\ndiscrimination of certain groups,\ndeterioration into conflict (due to grievances about the efforts),\ndelegitimization of the state (if NGOs and international actors perform more successful environmental management), and\ndegradation of the environment (e.g., cooperative resource exploitation).\nThese adverse effects are often unintended and avoidable. In 2022, he received the Enhancing the Environmental Peacebuilding Knowledge Base Award for this work.\nCareer\nIde was born in 1985. He studied Political Science and Media and Communication Studies at the University of Leipzig (2005\u20132012). Afterwards, he went on to receive a PhD in Earth Sciences from the University of Hamburg (2015) and his habilitation in Political Science from the Technical University of Braunschweig (2019). After his PhD, he worked at the Georg Eckert Institute and at the University of Melbourne. He was also a visiting researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the American University in Washington, DC.\nImpact and awards\nMedia and decision makers have drawn on Ide's research. He was worked with the World Bank (Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction), the United Nations (UN Economic and Social Council), NATO, the European Union, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, among others. Ide's work featured in many news articles, including in the Atlantic, CTV News, de Volkskrant, Publico,Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen (SRF), Courthouse News Service, as well as in podcasts like Policy, Guns & Money, POLIS180 and New Books in World Affairs.\nIde received several awards for his research. These include:\nthe 2023 Emerging Peace Studies Scholar Award of the International Studies Association,\nthe 2023 International Science Prize for Peace and Ecology in the Anthropocene (awarded by the Hans G\u00fcnter Brauch\u00a0 Foundation),\nthe 2022 Enhancing the Environmental Peacebuilding Knowledge Base Award (awarded by the Environmental Peacebuilding Association.\nIde is a director of the Environmental Peacebuilding Association and editor of the journal Environment and Security.

    "Beginning of Napoleon's invasion of Russia\nThe First French Empire declared war on Russian Empire on 22 June\u00a0\u00a01812, starting Napoleon's invasion two days later. The declaration of war was presented in a diplomatic note by French ambassador Jacques Lauriston to the Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Saltykov in Saint Petersburg. The note stated, in particularly, that the request for passports by Russian ambassador Alexander Kurakin meant a severance of diplomatic relations and that Napoleon \"from now on considers himself at war with Russia\". The note is kept in the Archive of Foreign Policy of the Russian Empire.\nMainstream Russian historiography often maintains that the French invasion of Russia was undeclared. \nBackground\nNapoleon stated that the casus belli was Russia's refusal to comply with the Treaty of Tilsit and of Erfurt. \nAccording to contemporary Russian historian Alexander Mikhailovsky-Danilevsky, Tsar Alexander I regarded Napoleon's refusal to withdraw from Prussia and Pomerania as an act of war and intended to proceed offensively in such case. In that scenario, according to the contingency plan, the Russian army would have crossed the border at the Neman in Olita, Merecha and Grodno. From April 1812, Kurakin started to demand passport for his recall and return, citing French Foreign Minister Hugues-Bernard Maret's avoidance to discuss the future Franco-Russian agreement on disputed matters proposed by Napoleon earlier in February.\nIn April 1812, as the French started to cross the Oder, Russian Field Marshal Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly asked for Alexander's I authorization to start offensive actions under the contingency plan, but Alexander I replied that further decisions will be made upon his arrival to Vilnius (Vilno at the time). Having arrived to Vilnius on 26 April , Alexander I conducted a review of troops, finding them in good condition.\nAt the end of April Alexander I received the French diplomat Louis, comte de Narbonne-Lara in Vilnius, to whom he presented the Russian rationale for taking proactive measures: the spread of French dominance in neighboring lands, approachment to the Russian borders and the French refusal to withdraw from Prussia and Swedish Pomerania. Danilevsky further describes Russian defensive plans in the event of French invasion, but notes that Napoleon's entry point into Russia was impossible to predict.\nOn 12 June 1812, Maret, in a correspondence with Kurakin, stated that France cannot accept Russian demands about French withdrawal behind the Elbe as a prerequisite to all peace negotiations and that France regards Kurakin's demand for passports as a declaration of war. On 22 June , Alexander I wrote to Saltykov: \"We expect to be attacked every hour. With full hope in the Almighty and in the courage of the Russian troops, we are preparing to repel the enemy\".\nDeclaration of war\nOn 22 June 1812, Lauriston, in response to Kurakin's earlier demand for passports, handed the declaration of war to Saltykov and also requested passports for himself and the entire embassy in order to return to France. Contrary to instructions from Paris, Lauriston tried to delay the formal declaration of war on Russia.\nOn the same day, the second Bulletin of the Grand Army was published, stating that \"all means of effecting an understanding between the two empires became impossible\". The bulletin further noted Kurakin's \"arrogant and extraordinary\" sine qua non demand that he would not offer explanations until France withdraws from its allied territories. \nAfter the war, Napoleon remarked: \"I did not wish to declare war against Russia, but I had the impression that Russia wanted to break with me. I knew very well the difficulties of such a campaign\".\nRussian historiography\nEarly and modern Russian historiography often maintains that the French invasion of Russia was undeclared, despite Lauriston's note. Danilevsky stated that Napoleon regarded Kurakin's demand for passports and Russian refusal to receive Lauriston in Vilnius \"as a sufficient rationale to invade Russia without the declaration of war\". Similarly, Soviet historian Yevgeny Tarle did not mention Lauriston's note, considering instead Napoleon's later appeal to the troops in Vilkavi\u0161kis Manor on 22 June as the declaration of war. The Research Institute of Military History at the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia regards the invasion as having occurred \"without prior declaration of war\" on the basis that the note was delivered to Alexander I in Vilnius only three days later, after the start of the invasion.\nDespite that, Lauriston's note was published in 1962 in the multivolume work The Foreign Policy of Russia of the 19th and the Beginning of the 20th Century by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some Russian historians, such as Konstantin Zalessky and Alexander Podmazo, also acknowledged the declaration of war.\n",

    "\nFootball club\nBeeston Football Club - also known as Beeston Town - was an association football club from Beeston, then a village near Nottingham, active in the late 19th century.\nHistory\nThe club claimed a foundation date of 1873, but it had a fitful existence for the 1870s and 1880s, playing mostly friendly matches. The club had a major boost in 1889, when several amateur players seceded from Nottingham Forest after the Reds turned professional.  The club duly entered the 1889\u201390 FA Cup qualifying rounds, its first entry to the competition, but lost 3\u20132 to Notts Rangers in the first round; seven of the players were former Forest players.\nIt also entered the Nottinghamshire Senior Cup in 1889\u201390, and drew Forest at home in the first round; as Forest had a Football Alliance match at home on the same day, it sent a third XI to the tie, which Beeston won, but in the face of the rival attraction in the town, the crowd was a mere 200.  Beeston went all the way to the final, at Forest's Gregory Ground, and won the trophy for the only time, thanks to a 3\u20131 win Newark.\nNewark complained about biased refereeing, and had a chance for revenge in the 1890\u201391 FA Cup qualifying rounds as the clubs were drawn together in the second round, Beeston having had a bye.  Newark looked as if it had indeed gained a modicum of revenge, reversing the final score on its own patch, but Beeston successfully protested that Newark had fielded an ineligible player, and Beeston was put through to the third round instead.  Beeston duly lost 6\u20131 at Rotherham Town at the next stage, a result which \"came as glad tidings to Newark\".\nBeeston last entered the FA Cup in 1892\u201393, and scored its only win, beating Gedling Grove 4\u20131 in the first qualifying round; Beeston had been drawn at home, but its ground was flooded, so it was switched to the Nottingham Town ground, and \"no-one attended\".  In the second round, the club played well in the first half at Kettering, but \"fell to pieces\" in the second and lost 6\u20131.\nThe club never disbanded as such, but petered out, as it did not join a league, which even town rival Beeston St John's managed to do; it was noted in January 1893 that it had not played for 8 weeks, and the blame was put on the accession of Nottingham Forest to the Football League, as that meant local football fans could see League football most weekends.\nThe club finished the 1894\u201395 season as runner-up in the Mansfield Charity Cup, going down 3\u20130 to Mansfield in the final, and also lost in the final (2\u20131 to Newstead Byron) in 1895\u201396, but that was the club's only fixture of note in 1896, and it does not seem to have played again.\nColours\nThe club's colours were a Corinthian white and navy blue, probably referring to a plain jersey.\nGround\nThe club originally used the cricket ground, next to Beeston railway station, and the Victoria Hotel opposite provided facilities.  In 1893 it found a new ground on the Chilwell side of the Midland Railway line.\nNotable players\nWalter Luntley (goalkeeper) and George Lutin (centre-forward), brother and brother-in-law respectively of England international Ted Luntley, both of whom left Forest for Beeston in 1889\n",

    "1970s Australian political art movement\n \nThe Progressive Art Movement ('PAM) was a 1970s Australian political art movement based in Adelaide, South Australia. Co-founded by feminist artist Ann Newmarch, the group included Mandy Martin, who was very involved in the development of feminist art in Australia, along with other well-known men and women artists. \nOrigins\nIn 1974 South Australian artist Ann Newmarch, along with philosopher and academic Brian Medlin, founded the Progressive Art Movement (PAM), which focused on political issues, social concerns, and education. It arose from  a course at Flinders University called Politics and Art, and was inspired by Marxist Leninist theory. Medlin was foundation professor of philosophy at Flinders from 1967 to 1988.\nDescription\nThe Progressive Art Movement, based in Adelaide, was part of a bigger movement that was pushing back against elitism in the art world, and the group produced art that used cheaper materials, making it more accessible to artists and the public, such as silk screen printing and posters. PAM defined itself as a political organisation, and often mounted protests at institutions such as the Art Gallery of South Australia.\nPrintmaker Ruth Faerber wrote when reviewing an exhibition of Adelaide art at the Art Gallery of NSW in 1977 that PAM was \"motivated by a strong Marxist sociopolitical direction, agreed to a shared program for action and a sense of immediate imperative\", compared with the Experimental Art Foundation, which did not commit to a set of agreed aims.\nMandy Martin wrote in 1989 that members of PAM were involved in \"the front organisation of the worker student alliance, a front organisation itself of the highly secretive CPAML, the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist\u2013Leninist)\"...  had an essentially Maoist line, and all the strategies were based around the Maoist two stage revolution, that is allying with the bourgeoisie to expel the foreign imperialists, in this case the Americans, and supporting the working\u2013class struggle. In turn, PAM had many front organisations itself, the main one being the campaign against foreign military bases... We really believed we were in a pre\u2013revolutionary state and, under persistent harassment from the police, we engaged in often foolhardy campaigns\". The artists targeted and infiltrated the car industry \"because it was run by Americans, although it was one of the few viable industries in South Australia\". The Free Will Hight campaign caused an internal division in PAM, as it caused many layoffs at Chrysler/Holden, and, in Martin's view, \"perpetrated a gross injustice on Will Hight in the guise of social reform\".\nMartin was castigated by the communist elements of the group for \"fraternising with the enemy\" after learning that she had had lunch with visiting American feminist curator and writer Lucy Lippard and Australian art historian Terry Smith. She \"didn't so much desert the ship but I certainly moved to one side\", after realising that she did not want to confine her criticism to capitalism, but wanted to critique socialism as well.\nMembers\nThe group included students, writers, artists, filmmakers, and poets among its membership. Artists associated with PAM included:\nRobert Boynes\nJim Crowley\nMargaret Dodd\nBert Flugelman\nPamela Harris (1946\u20131992)\nAndrew Hill (born 1952)\nJenni Hill\nMandy Martin (1952\u20132021), painter, printmaker, and teacher\nAnn Newmarch\nKen Searle\nRichard Turner\nRobert Boynes doing an MA in film at Flinders University, and was making films and videos about painting and image production, and started producing colour screenprinted images in 1973.\nRobert Boynes and Mandy Martin were married. They moved to Canberra in 1978.  Mandy Martin was very involved in the development of feminist art in Australia, and was a student at the time she was part of PAM.\nAndrew Hill (born 1952), is a painter, printmaker, theatre, film and graphic designer. He was associate professor at the UniSA 1979\u20132014, Director of the South Australian School of Art (2011\u20132014), and Associate Head of School at the School of Art, Architecture and Design at UniSA (2010\u20132014).\nExhibitions\nFrom 16 May until 5 July 2024, the Flinders University Museum of Art is mounting the exhibition If you don't fight... you lose: politics, posters and PAM, co-curated by art historian Catherine Speck and Jude Adams, with accompanying catalogue. They found a strong feminist element in the group, that was not celebrated as much at the time, and say that, while times are different, protest art continues in the same vein today.\n",

He was the son of Barend and Edith (Olcott) Van Gerbig and grandson of Frederic P. Olcott. He graduated from the St. Paul's School.\nPrinceton\nFootball\nVan Gerbig played halfback for the Princeton freshman team in 1920. He made the varsity team the following season and was the backup fullback behind Hank Garrity. He started against Navy and Chicago while Garrity hurt. Due to an injury to Donold Lourie, Garrity was moved to quarterback and Van Gerbig started at halfback. Van Gerbig scored a receiving touchdown in Princeton's 34 to 0 win over Virginia. Van Gerbig was the backup halfback behind Harry W. Crum on Princeton's 1922 national championship team. He was a starting back for the 1923 Princeton Tigers football team. He was the team's best punter and scored two touchdowns against Swarthmore College. Van Gerbig muffed a punt in the third quarter against Harvard, which led to Crimson scoring the go-ahead field goal in their 5\u20130 victory.\nHockey\nVan Gerbig debuted for the Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey team in 1921. On January 6, 1922, he scored all four goals in Princeton's 4\u20130 victory over Penn.\nOn March 20, 1922, Van Gerbig was elected captain of the 1922\u201323 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey team. He started the season as a defenseman, but was moved to right wing during the January 5, 1923 game against the St. Nicholas Hockey Club, which was the first game ever played at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. He scored the game-tying and game-winning goals in the Tigers' 3\u20132 victory over St. Nicks. Later that year, Van Gerbig had a five-goal game against MIT and a six-goal game against Penn. On January 13, he scored two goals in Princeton's 3 to 1 victory over the George Owen-led Harvard Crimson. Four days later, he recorded a hat-trick in a 14\u20130 victory over Columbia. Princeton finished the season with a 13\u20135\u20131 record.\nGoing into his senior season, Van Gerbig was described by Boston Globe hockey writer John J. Hallahan as \"one of the greatest in the college ranks\" and \"the nearest approach Princeton has ever had to the great Hobey Baker\". On January 4, 1924, Van Gerbig scored a goal in a 2\u20131 victory over Dartmouth, which was captained by another leading college player, Bob Hall, at the Boston Arena. On January 12, he scored all three of Princeton's goals in the Tigers 4\u20133 double-overtime loss to Yale. On January 24, Van Gerbig scored the game-tying goal in a 4\u20131 overtime victory against the St. Nicholas Hockey Club.

On January 17, 1925, his cheek was injured in a game against the Fort Pitt Hornets where teammate Leo Hughes lost an eye. Doctors recommended Van Gerbig sit out the team's next game against Fort Pitt, which he refused to do. He was eventually convinced by his mother to sit out the remainder of the regular season, however he returned for the Eastern championship series against the Hornets. The B.A.A disbanded its team after the season due to rumors that their players had violated their amateur status by receiving money from Boston Arena management.\nSquash\nVan Gerbig competed in the 1929 United States Class C squash tennis championship tournament. He made it to the semifinals, where he lost to Harold Ablowich. On February 27, 1930, Van Gerbig defeated Adrian S. Kuhn in three sets to capture the national Class B championship. He had little playing experience prior to the tournament, but was a protege of former world champion Walter Kinsella. Van Gerbig was a hard-hitter and shattered three racquets during the final.\nGolf\nVan Gerbig played golf for many years, but began taking the sport seriously in 1940.

    "Slot-machine magnate and philanthropist (1887\u20131959)\nRobert Joseph \"Bob\" Gans (October 27, 1887\u00a0\u2013 September 17, 1959) was the \"slot-machine king\" of the Los Angeles underworld during the interwar period, and later a philanthropist and civic leader. For many years, he ran the board of Mt. Sinai Hospital, now Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Gans was one of the most circumspect figures in the history of organized crime in southern California, but he was associated with both Charlie Crawford's City Hall Gang of the 1920s and Guy McAfee's Syndicate in the 1930s. \nThe slot-machine kingdom was a family business built by Bob Gans with his older brothers Joe Gans and Charlie Gans, Bob's son Cliff Gans, and his nephew-in-law Abe Chapman. The finances of the business are poorly understood but the amalgamated best guesstimates of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the handful of local crime-beat newspaper reporters who were not personally graft-adjacent seems to suggest that the Gans operation may have had gross revenues over 20 years of approximately US$200,000,000 (equivalent to $4,349,643,705 in 2023) and top-line profits for the proprietors over the same period of, at minimum, US$15,000,000 (equivalent to $326,223,278 in 2023).\nBackground\nSlot machines in collection of National Museum of American History, transferred to the Smithsonian after being confiscated by the U.S. Marshal's Service\nIn early 20th-century California, there were countless venues for gaming, and their importance only grew as the Roaring Twenties collapsed into the Great Depression: \"Slot machines could be found in the rear of many restaurants. Pinball machines that paid off in cash helped pay the rent in many small-business establishments\". Many of the sins attributed to Prohibition were equally associated with gambling, which was America's biggest underworld business by 1931. Many of the places in Los Angeles that were storied \"secret\" bars were also secret or not-so-secret casinos. For example, at Frank Sebastian's Cotton Club on Washington Boulevard, half the reason for the floor show and the \"brassy band\" was to \"drown out the sounds from the casino upstairs\". Charles J. Lick claimed to believe he was leasing the \"submarine garden\" hidden below his Dome Pier to honest aficionados of billiards, but after the heavily guarded basement casino outfitted like a \"junior Monte Carlo concession\" was raided four times, he canceled the lease. Jack Doyle's place in Vernon had alcohol after neighboring Los Angeles passed the Gandier ordinance\u2014and a card room. Generally speaking, coin-operated slot machines and pinball machines were a poor man's game, that brought in a flow of cash with a profit margin ample enough to make their operators rich over time. There were slots and pinball machines in the back of just about every bar, nightclub, pool hall, amusement park, carnival, ice-cream parlor, and drugstore in the Greater Los Angeles area during the interwar period, and as one nostalgic account put it, \"It is probably true that the pinball business was not simon pure...It is probably true that bars paid off big-hitters with beers, and tobacco shops paid off big-hitters with cigars. It is probably true that, worse, money changed hands. It is probably true that more than one L.A. schoolboy spent his lunch money and carfare in a pinball machine and had to walk home from school hungry.\" A darker interpretation claims that Al Capone once said he'd give up every other criminal enterprise if he could have slot machines, and that slot machines were invented the day the devil was accidentally left in charge of the world.\nUndated image of slot machine and dice table confiscated in a raid at the \"Pico Palace\" (Los Angeles Herald Examiner photo via Los Angeles Public Library)\nAfter \"bell\" slot machines were banned over the course of the 1920s and 1930s in various California jurisdictions, they were replaced by pinball machines, which at that time were not games of skill with flippers and lights, but rather \"a gambling game, a bingo game,  there isn't any play. You put in your nickel and five balls are released. You shoot the balls and watch them drop into a pattern of 25 holes, each one guarded by a series of pins the size of finishing nails. Each hole is numbered, each number corresponds to a bingo kind of board on the back-box. If you get three, four or five in a row you win 4, 16 or 75 to 1, unless you've pumped in some extra nickels and succeeded in changing the odds to 8, 24 and 96 to 1 or up to 192, 480, and 600 to 1. There's no play. The ball rolls, and you're as helpless to direct it as you are to affect the wheels on a slot machine\".\nEarly career\n\"Robert J. (Bob) Gans was to become Los Angeles' slot-machine king (since retired) and a political power who frowned on rough stuff and kept his word.

    "Ethnic group in Timor\nEthnic group\nTetum cottage in Dato Rua\u00a0.\nThe Tetum, also known as Tetun or Belu in Indonesia, are an ethnic group that are the indigenous inhabitants of the island of Timor. This ethnic group inhabits the Belu Regency in Indonesia and most of East Timor. Their language is called Tetum, which is part of the Austronesian language family. Apart from the island of Timor, this ethnic group is also found in Jakarta, Indonesia.\nOrigins\nSee also: de:Lulik\nAmong the Tetum Terik of Viqueque, it is believed that the first humans emerged from two orfices or vaginas, \"Mahuma\" and \"Lequi Bui\", emerging on the ground by climbing sacred tendrils. Therefore, among the Tetum Terik, the door of the house is traditionally referred to as the vagina and the inside is called WOMB, the women's room. According to their beliefs, the Tetum Terik universe, which is divided into the underworld and the upper world, is connected through a woman's vagina. The lower or sacred world is defined as feminine, dominated by women, while the secular and masculine upper world is occupied by men. According to their beliefs, the two worlds must be united, otherwise infertility, disease and death will threaten.\nBased on stories that have been passed down from generation to generation, it is believed that the Tetum ethnic group originally came from Malacca on the Malay Peninsula, then moved to several places before finally arriving on the island of Timor, namely in the eastern part of the island. This story is also believed to be the origin of the founding of the Kingdom of Malacca\u00a0 in West Timor, which is one of the kingdoms led by the Tetum ethnic group.\nOverview\nLanguage map of the island of Timor.\nThe Malayo-Polynesian Tetum form the largest ethnic group in East Timor with approximately 450,000 people and the second largest in West Timor with 500,000 people. They only migrated in the 14th century, when according to their records, the Tetum people came from Malacca. First they settled in the centre of the island and pushed the Atoni Meto to the western part of Timor. They then advanced further east and founded four kingdoms, of which Wehali was the most powerful. Likewise, their language became the lingua franca in the centre and east of the island. Even today, Tetums live in the centre of the island on both sides of the border and on the southeastern coast.\nThe Tetum speak various dialects of Tetum. Tetun Prasa is the official language of East Timor alongside Portuguese. In East Timor alone, over 432,766 people speak Tetum as their first language (2015). Of the different dialects, 361,027 East Timorese stated that Tetun Prasa is their mother tongue, 71,418 mentioned Tetun Terik, and 321 caused Nanaek (2015).\nThe historical exonym Belu means 'friend' or 'protector'. Therefore, the eastern part of the island of Timor was called Belu during colonial times.\nIn contrast to other Tetun speakers, the \"Tetum Terik Fehan\" are matriarchally organised, which is otherwise only the case in Bunak and Galoli in East Timor. The Tetum Terik Fehan ethnic group lives in Manufahi, Cova Lima, Bobonaro and Manatuto.\nCulture\nTraditional dance\nOne of the traditional dances of the Tetun ethnic group is the Likurai dance\u00a0, which is danced by women to welcome guests or fighters returning from war.\nWedding\nTetum women who are and have been married traditionally wear tattoos with certain motifs that symbolise their social status.  Tetum brides and grooms also have traditional clothing equipped with headdresses, fabrics, necklaces, studs, and other jewellery with distinctive patterns and meanings.\nSee also\nEast Timor portalIndonesia portal\nLook up Tetum in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Tetum.\nTetum language\nCulture of East Timor\nAtoni\nKemak people\n",
    "Model in statistical mechanics\nPhase diagram of random subcube model.\nIn statistical mechanics, the random-subcube model (RSM) is an exactly solvable model that reproduces key properties of hard constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and optimization problems, such as geometrical organization of solutions, the effects of frozen variables, and the limitations of various algorithms like decimation schemes.\nThe RSM consists of a set of N binary variables, where solutions are defined as points in a hypercube. The model introduces clusters, which are random subcubes of the hypercube, representing groups of solutions sharing specific characteristics. As the density of constraints increases, the solution space undergoes a series of phase transitions similar to those observed in CSPs like random k-satisfiability (k-SAT) and random k-coloring (k-COL). These transitions include clustering, condensation, and ultimately the unsatisfiable phase where no solutions exist.\nThe RSM is equivalent to these real CSPs in the limit of large constraint size. Notably, it reproduces the cluster size distribution and freezing properties of k-SAT and k-COL in the large-k limit. This is similar to how the random energy model is the large-p limit of the p-spin glass model.\nSetup\nSubcubes\nThere are  particles. Each particle can be in one of two states .\nThe state space  has  states. Not all are available. Only those satisfying the constraints are allowed.\nEach constraint is a subset  of the state space. Each  is a \"subcube\", structured like \nwhere each  can be one of .\nThe available states is the union of these subsets:\nRandom subcube model\nEach random subcube model is defined by two parameters .\nTo generate a random subcube , sample its components  IID according to \nNow sample  random subcubes, and union them together.\nEntropies\nThe entropy density of the -th cluster in bits is\nThe entropy density of the system in bits is\nPhase structure\nCluster sizes and numbers\nLet  be the number of clusters with entropy density , then it is binomially distributed, thus\nwhere \nBy the Chebyshev inequality, if , then  concentrates to its mean value. Otherwise, since ,  also concentrates to  by the Markov inequality.\nThus, \nalmost surely as .\nWhen  exactly, the two forces exactly balance each other out, and  does not collapse, but instead converges in distribution to the Poisson distribution  by the law of small numbers.\nLiquid phase\nFor each state, the number of clusters it is in is also binomially distributed, with expectation\nSo if , then it concentrates to , and so each state is in an exponential number of clusters.\nIndeed, in that case, the probability that all states are allowed is\nThus almost surely, all states are allowed, and the entropy density is 1 bit per particle.\nClustered phase\nIf , then it concentrates to zero exponentially, and so most states are not in any cluster. Those that do are exponentially unlikely to be in more than one. Thus, we find that almost all states are in zero clusters, and of those in at least one cluster, almost all are  in just one cluster. The state space is thus roughly speaking the disjoint union of the clusters.\nAlmost surely, there are  clusters of size , therefore, the state space is dominated by clusters with optimal entropy density .\nThus, in the clustered phase, the state space is almost entirely partitioned among  clusters of size  each. Roughly, the state space looks like exponentially many equally-sized clusters.\nCondensation phase\nAnother phase transition occurs when , that is,When , the optimal entropy density becomes unreachable, as there almost surely exists zero clusters with entropy density . Instead, the state space is dominated by clusters with entropy close to , the larger solution to .\nNear , the contribution of clusters with entropy density  to the total state space is\nAt large , the possible entropy densities are . The contribution of each is  \nWe can tabulate them as follows:\nThus, we see that for any , at  limit, over  of the total state space is covered by only a finite number of clusters. The state space looks partitioned into clusters with exponentially decaying sizes. This is the condensation phase.\nUnsatisfiable phase\nWhen , the number of clusters is zero, so there are no states.\nExtensions\nThe RSM can be extended to include energy landscapes, allowing for the study of glassy behavior, temperature chaos, and the dynamic transition.\nSee also\nRandom energy model\n",
    "Austrian software developer and journalist\nChristo Buschek (born 1980 in Graz) is an Austrian information technologist, investigative journalist, BuzzFeed employee, and recipient of the 2021 Pulitzer Prize in the category of International Reporting.\nBiography\nChristo Buschek attended the Academic Gymnasium Graz starting in 1990, where he graduated with his Matura in 1998.\nHe has worked in the IT sector for nearly 20 years as a software developer, programmer, and expert in information security. His specialty is working on data-driven investigations for human rights organizations and investigative journalists.\nStarting in 2018, he collaborated with Megha Rajagopalan and Alison Killing on a project investigating the largely untraceable Uyghur internment camps operated by the Chinese authorities. Buschek's programming tools enabled the collection and processing of data for the investigation.\nCombining satellite imagery with interviews with former detainees, the team identified around 260 camp locations and re-education camps in Xinjiang in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, many more than officially known. These locations were categorized into three groups: those with high certainty, those believed to be camps but not proven, and those with a certain probability. The data was verifiable in all cases. The research results were published on August 27, 2020, on BuzzFeed News.\nIn collaboration with Hadi Al Khatib and Giovanni Civardi, Buschek is also involved in a project to securely make data on human rights violations accessible. He is a member of the team at Paper trail media, an investigative journalism firm founded in 2022 by Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer, which collaborates closely with Der Spiegel, ZDF, Der Standard, and the Tamedia Group. He is also a Knowing Machines Fellow at the Engelberg Center on Innovation Law & Policy at the New York University School of Law.\nPulitzer Prize\nChristo Buschek was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting on June 11, 2021, along with Megha Rajagopalan and Alison Killing, for their four-part investigative report Built to Last on BuzzFeed News, which uncovered the previously unknown Uyghur camps in China. He is the first Austrian to receive the Pulitzer Prize, which has been awarded since 1917 and the first Pulitzer Prize won by a BuzzFeed News team.\n",
    "American planter, patriot and politician\nBenjamin Lankford (1727 \u2013 August 12, 1810)(sometimes spelled \"Langford\") was an American patriot, planter and politician who represented Pittsylvania County, Virginia during the final session of the House of Burgesses, several of the Virginia Revolutionary Conventions and in the Virginia House of Delegates most years until 1790. Lankford was also one of the captains of Pittsylvania's militia during the American Revolutionary War, although his service mostly involved procuring supplies.\nComplicating matters, another man of the same name, Benjamin Lankford (1798\u20131886), but whose family had lived in tidewater Somerset County, Maryland for two centuries, served in the Maryland General Assembly beginning in the 1840s through the 1876, first as a Whig, then as a Republican.\nEarly life\nBenjamin Lankford may have been born in Louisa County, from parents who moved westward from Tidewater Gloucester County to Caroline County and finally somewhat south to Louisa County. He may have had a dozen brothers and sisters.\nCareer\nLankford continued moving south along the frontier when he came of age, possibly because his parents' debts exceeded their assets when they died, or would be insufficient to raise younger siblings. Upon creation of Pittsylvania County from then-vast Halifax County in 1767, Lankford was elected the new county's first sheriff, as well as one of the justices of the peace who jointly governed the county.  In the first tax list for Pittsylvania, in 1767, Lankford paid taxes on Moll, an enslaved woman. Two decades later, in the 1787 Virginia tax census, Lankford paid taxes in Pittsylvania County for owning seven enslaved teenaged Blacks and two Black adults, as well as four horses and 14 cattle, and was the only taxpayer in the county with that surname. Neither Thomas Lankford in that census owned slaves, nor lived nearby, although possible relative Nicholas Lankford of Caroline County owned two enslaved Black adults and two teenagers, in addition to three horses and seven cattle.\nWhen relations with Britain grew tense, Lankford became captain of a militia company (one of 27 Pittsylvania captains during the conflict), as well as joined the local Committee of Safety (among 31 members), and continued as justice of the peace. In 1777, when Robert Williams resigned as colonel of the county militia and was replaced by John Wilson, Lankford was promoted to major. When John Donelson announced his resignation and plans to move to Tennessee in 1779, John Wilson succeeded him as county Lieutenant and Lankford became the militia's colonel.\nPittsylvania voters elected Lankford and fellow militia captain Peter Perkins as their representatives to what proved to be the final session of the House of Burgesses, which began in 1775. Those men, and the veteran planter politicians they had replaced as burgesses (Hugh Innes who was creating Henry County, and John Donelson who was county lieutenant but planned to move to Tennessee) represented Pittsylvania during the first revolutionary convention, then Lankford and Perkins represented the county at most later conventions. Scholars noted that no documentation exists that either Lankford nor Perkins was actually present at the third convention and Robert Williams (who served many years as Pittsylvania's commonwealth attorney and militia colonel and succeeded Donelson as county lieutenant) replaced Perkins at the fifth convention. When Virginia declared her independence and the Virginia House of Delegates replaced the burgesses (though still a part-time position), Lankford would be elected and re-elected until 1790, albeit with gaps, serving first alongside Robert Williams, then after the pair was temporarily replaced by Abraham Shelton and Peter Perkins in 1777\u20131778, again served alongside John Wilson in 1779, Thomas Terry in 1780 and attorney Haynes Morgan in 1781. With another gap in 1782, Lankford served alongside William Dix in 1783 and 1784, then alongside William Harrison in 1785, Constant Perkins in 1786, William Lynch in 1787 and 1788, again with William Dix in 1789 and finally with future congressman Matthew Clay in 1790 before being replaced by Thomas Tunstall, clerk of the court.\nPersonal life\nLankford married twice. His first wife was named Winifred, and bore two sons and six daughters before her death. After her death, Lankford remarried on January 1, 1777, in Halifax, to a widow with three young children, Mrs. Henrietta (Bowcock) Booker, widow of Edward Booker, who bore another son and daughter. One of his sons, Thomas Lankford, was murdered on a trip to Kentucky to visit the Todd family; neither of Lankford's other two sons married.\nDeath and legacy\nLankford died in Pittsylvania County in 1810, and was probably buried in the county. His will was admitted to probate the next year. It named seven children, but the Lankford surname ceased in Pittsylvania county, his daughters having married into the Todd, Madison, Browne and T",
    "1930 coup d'\u00e9tat in Peru\nThe 1930 Peruvian coup d'\u00e9tat took place on August 22\u201327, 1930, headed by commander Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro in Arequipa, although with the support of Manuel Mar\u00eda Ponce Brousset's force in Lima, against President Augusto B. Legu\u00eda.\nS\u00e1nchez Cerro, who, through a manifesto to the nation, revolted the garrison of Arequipa against the government of Augusto B. Legu\u00eda. The military rebellion spread through southern Peru, extending to the country's capital, Lima, where the city's garrison joined the coup. The result of the coup was successful for S\u00e1nchez Cerro, who arrived in Lima on August 25 to take the reins of the country, while Legu\u00eda resigned from the Presidency and was imprisoned in the city's penitentiary.\nBackground\nBeginning in 1930, the second government of Augusto B. Legu\u00eda entered its eleventh consecutive year, struggling in a severe and accelerated economic crisis, an extension of the world economic crisis, due to the crash of 1929. The labour sectors, directly affected by the rise in the cost of living and the scarcity of subsistence and influenced by unionism and the Communist Party, were the first to raise their protest.\nThe crisis, however, was not only economic. The evident administrative corruption, from which close associates or friends of the president benefited throughout the regime, as well as the signing of the border treaties with Colombia (Salom\u00f3n\u2013Lozano Treaty) and Chile (Lima Treaty) with territorial transfer, further accentuated the opposition to the government. The army also showed its discontent. Subversive actions and plans to assassinate the president were rumoured.\nCoup\nOne of the conspirators was Lieutenant Colonel Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro, who was in command of a garrison in Arequipa. S\u00e1nchez Cerro was already an acquaintance of Legu\u00eda's regime. In 1921 and 1922 he had participated in provincial uprisings, as a result of which he was imprisoned on the islands of Taquile and San Lorenzo, but he later reconciled with the government and was readmitted to the army.\nLegu\u00eda, in his memoirs, says that in March 1930 he signed the promotion to commander of the then Major S\u00e1nchez Cerro, despite the distrust that he inspired in him, but stating that he did so on the recommendation of Foci\u00f3n Mari\u00e1tegui\u00a0 (considered number 2 man of his regime). and General Manuel Mar\u00eda Ponce Brousset. Legu\u00eda suspected that Mari\u00e1tegui had conspired with S\u00e1nchez Cerro to perpetrate the coup d'\u00e9tat, but there has never been proof of this.\nArequipa\nS\u00e1nchez Cerro with a crowd in Arequipa.\nIn the early morning hours of August 22, 1930, the troops stationed in Arequipa left their barracks to carry out routine exercises. Already in the countryside, between the cemetery and Socabaya, Commander S\u00e1nchez Cerro addressed them and urged them to rebel to put an end to Legu\u00eda's regime, one that was \"a shame for the country.\" The troops jubilantly approved his, words, beginning the revolution. At twelve in the morning, S\u00e1nchez Cerro, leading the soldiers, entered the city of Misti, whose population, recovered from his initial surprise, enthusiastically joined the movement.\nThat same day, S\u00e1nchez Cerro gave a decree signed alone, by which he titled himself \"Commander in Chief of the Southern Army and Head of Government.\" Likewise, he proclaimed himself \"Supreme Military and Political Chief\", and from his \"Government House\" in Arequipa, he gave another decree appointing his secretaries, who were: Major Alejandro Barco\u00a0 (Military Affairs); Jos\u00e9 Luis Bustamante y Rivero (Political Affairs); Manuel A. Vinelli (Financial and Administrative Affairs); Major Rub\u00e9n del Castillo (Postal Affairs and Transmissions); Major Julio Arboleda Vi\u00f1as (Transportation and Communications) and Gustavo de la Jara (Comptroller General).\nThe political statement of the rebels was written by Bustamante and is known as the \"Arequipa Manifesto\", described by Jorge Basadre, as a \"beautiful and lyrical document\" that left an impression throughout the country.\nThe insurgent movement spread rapidly through the south of the country. On August 23, the fourth division stationed in Puno, which was the largest in the region, allied itself to the rebellion. Also in Lima the atmosphere was favourable for the revolution.\nLima\nLegu\u00eda's house looted by supporters of the coup.\nThe news of the Arequipa uprising reached Lima on the night of August 22. The government ordered the closure of the port of Mollendo and the suspension of flights to the city of Arequipa. On Sunday the 24th, Legu\u00eda went to Santa Beatriz racetrack, as was his usual habit every weekend. On the street, he began to be heckled by locals.\nWanting to take some measure to confront the situation, Legu\u00eda decided to form a military cabinet, at the head of which he placed General Fernando Sarmiento. Said cabinet was sworn in at one in the morning on August 25. Legu\u00eda's intention was to resign the presidency before Congress and leave power in the hands of said cabinet.\nBut simultane",

She graduated in Arabic Language and Literature from Cattolica University, Milan, and received a Ph.D. in Islamic Studies from Istituto Universitario Orientale, Naples. She has been a Distinguished Senior Fellow at Gatestone Institute, a member of the Board of Guarini Institute for Public Affairs at John Cabot University, Rome, a member of the scientific board of the Center Di-con-per Donne, University of Rome Tor Vergata, of the scientific board of the Institute of High Studies for Women, Rome, and a member of the Committee for Italian Islam, Ministry of Interior. She has taught at the University of Bologna, the Sapienza University of Rome, the Tuscia of Viterbo, the Sacro Cuore of Milan and at the School of Higher Studies at Lucca.\nColombo is the official Italian translator of the Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz, and other authors of classical and contemporary Arabic literature. In 2004, she edited an anthology of 20th century Arab writers in L'altro Mediterraneo: Antologia di scrittori arabi del Novecento. In 2005, she was the editor of the anthology of short stories Parola di donna, corpo di donna: antologia di scrittrici arabe contemporanee, a collection of 31 contemporary Arab women writers. She edited another anthology of 29 Arab poets in the book Non ho peccato abbastanza: antologia di poetesse arabe contemporanee in 2007. The same year, she edited Basta!: Musulmani contro l'estremismo islamico, an anthology of essays from over 50 writers of Muslim background against Islamic extremism.\nIn her own writings, Colombo argues that the Muslim Brotherhood is infiltrating European societies in an effort to establish an Islamic state, and that it is connected to terrorist organisations. In 2012, she participated in the international counter-jihad conference in Brussels, billed as the \"International Conference for Free Speech & Human Rights\". She was also announced as a speaker at a conference of Stop Islamization of Nations (SION) in New York City the same year.\nPersonal life\nColombo is married to Egyptian-Italian Magdi Allam, and they have a son together.\nBibliography\nAnthologies\nL'altro Mediterraneo: Antologia di scrittori arabi del Novecento.

    "On 21 February 2024, the National Assembly of South Africa voted to impeach Judge John Hlophe, a judge of the High Court of South Africa and the judge president of the Western Cape Division. Hlophe was accused of improper interference in the deliberations of the Constitutional Court in litigation involving the interests of Jacob Zuma. His impeachment was the result of a finding by the Judicial Service Commission that his conduct in this regard amounted to gross misconduct. Hlophe was the first judge to be impeached under the post-apartheid Constitution.\nBackground and allegations\nIn 2008, the Constitutional Court of South Africa decided Thint v NDPP; Zuma v NDPP, which concerned the lawfulness of search and seizure warrants. The case was politically sensitive because the warrants in question were issued during an investigation by the Scorpions' into alleged corruption by Jacob Zuma, a prominent politician who was the former Deputy President of South Africa and the present leader of the African National Congress (ANC). On 31 July 2008, the court handed down judgment in Thint, finding against Zuma.\nBefore that, however, in late June 2008, the Constitutional Court bench announced that they had jointly submitted a formal complaint to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) against John Hlophe, a prominent judge who had been the Judge President of the High Court's Cape Provincial Division since 2000. Two members of the bench, Justice Bess Nkabinde and Acting Justice Chris Jafta, alleged that Hlophe had met with them personally and attempted to persuade them to rule in Zuma's favour in Thint. Hlophe denied this account.\nJudicial Service Commission proceedings\nInitial responses: June 2008\nThe Cape Bar Council on 2 June 2008 indicated that it had requested the JSC to \"...\u00a0facilitate Judge Hlophe's absence from office pending the final determination of the complaint\u00a0...\", stating that it was \"...\u00a0untenable for Judge Hlophe to continue in office pending the determination of the complaint\u00a0...\".\nThe Law Society of South Africa, the umbrella body for attorneys throughout the country, was reported to have expressed its \"...\u00a0grave concern\u00a0...\" and to have stated that it had \"...\u00a0no doubt that the Constitutional Court judges considered the matter carefully before lodging the complaint\".\nAttorney Peter Horn, the President of the Law Society of the Cape of Good Hope, representative body of attorneys in the Western and Eastern Cape, urged Judge Hlophe to take a leave of absence and that there needed to be a \"...\u00a0sense of great urgency\u00a0...\", and that the JSC should make a special effort to get its members together before the end of the week.  Noting that the Society did not prejudge the issue, he stated further on the Society's behalf that \"...\u00a0if the allegations are found to be correct, then clearly the judge president cannot continue to serve on the bench\".\nThe JSC met on Friday 6 June 2008, but adjourned as a result of the Constitutional Court's not having answered interrogatories by the meeting.\nHlophe was reported on 6 June 2008 to have taken leave of absence, and to have been replaced temporarily by his deputy, Jeanette Traverso.\nOn 10 June 2008 Judge Hlophe lodged a complaint with the JSC against the judges of the Constitutional Court for violating his rights by publicising the complaint against him and by \"prejudging\" the issue. He was also defended in an open letter from Paul Ngobeni to the judges of the Constitutional Court.\nThe Constitutional Court delivered its full exposition of its complaint to the JSC on 17 June 2008. In it they reported that he had approached Judges Jafta and Nkabinde.  He had told Nkabinde that he had a \"mandate\" to approach her and that the four cases referred to above were important for the future of Jacob Zuma.  He told her that there was \"no real case against Mr Zuma and that it was now important to hold in his favour\".  Upon being asked what business it was of his to discuss the matter with her, Hlophe is reported to have replied that \"...\u00a0Mr Zuma was being \"persecuted\" as he  had been persecuted\".  Judge Jafta confirmed that a similar approach had been made to him, while refusing to divulge certain parts of the conversation, which he said were confidential and which he would keep so as a result of his long acquaintance, and friendship, with Hlophe. He stated that Hlophe had told him that he was \"...\u00a0our last hope\u00a0...\". Both judges stated that they had dealt with the matter firmly and rejected Judge Hlophe's advances.\nThe Court also explained that Judge Hlophe misunderstood their role.  As complainants they could not prejudge the matter as the JSC would adjudge it, not them.\nCounter-complaint and lawsuit: 2008\u20132009\nIn June 2008, as the JSC considered whether to proceed with the complaint against Hlophe, Hlophe lodged a counter-complaint at the JSC against the judges of the Constitutional Court. The following month, he approached the Gauteng High Court with a similar complaint, alleging that",

Holt (born June 15, 1951) is an American politician who served as the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development from 2015 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1995 to 1999 representing District 6, which included parts of Baltimore and Harford counties.\nEarly life and education\nHolt was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 15, 1951. He came to Maryland to attend the University of Maryland, College Park, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1974. While attending UMBC, Holt worked as a busser at the Laurel Park racetrack and on his grandfather's farm, Mount Peru, in Baltimore County. Holt inherited his grandfather's estate after two drifters broke in and killed his grandfather in 1986; he still lives at Mount Peru, where he raises thoroughbred horses.\nPolitical career\nHolt became interested in politics during his early years, embracing fiscal conservatism and the Republican Party but also expressing fascination with the Kennedy family and Martin Luther King Jr. He became more involved with politics after his grandfather's death in 1986, serving as a member of the Baltimore County Human Relations Board from 1988 to 1994 and as the president of the Baltimore County Police Foundation from 1992 to 1994.\nMaryland House of Delegates\nHolt was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1994, and was sworn in on January 11, 1995. During his tenure, he was a member of the Appropriations Committee, including its education and economic development subcommittee, and the Joint Audit Committee. He supported an unrealized proposal to build a NASCAR speedway in eastern Baltimore County and was a member of the Task Force on NASCAR Motor Sports from 1996 to 1997.\nHolt was considered a rising star within the Maryland Republican Party. He unsuccessfully ran for the Maryland Senate in 1998, losing to incumbent Democratic state senator Michael J. Collins in the general election with 44.8 percent of the vote.\nPost-legislative career\nHolt stayed out of local politics following his defeat in the 1998 Maryland Senate election, focusing instead on his farm and working in the private sector as a financial advisor. He worked as a policy advisor within the administration of Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich, where he helped develop proposals for slot machines and horse racing in the state, and served on the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System's Board of Trustees from 2003 to 2007.\nOn April 14, 2010, Holt announced that he would run for Baltimore County Executive in 2010, seeking to succeed Democratic county executive James T. Smith Jr., who was term-limited. He ran unopposed in the primary election and ran on a platform involving fiscal issues. Holt was defeated by county councilmember Kevin Kamenetz in the general election.\nMaryland Secretary of Housing\nIn December 2014, Holt was named to serve on the transition team of Governor-elect Larry Hogan. Hogan named Holt to serve as Secretary of the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development in January 2015. He was unanimously confirmed by the Maryland Senate on March 6, 2015, and sworn in on March 13.\nIn this position, Holt supported efforts to increase Maryland's affordable housing and home ownership rates, improve small business outreach, and provide funding for revitalizing urban areas, including in Baltimore through Project C.O.R.E. He also oversaw the launch of the SmartBuy program, which helped prospective new homebuyers purchase a house while paying off their student debt.\nHolt at the Maryland Association of Counties summer conference with Governor Hogan, 2019\nDuring the Maryland Association of Counties' summer conference in August 2015, Holt expressed support for loosening the state's lead paint poisoning laws, alleging that mothers were making their children put lead fishing weights in their mouth to make landlords liable to provide the child with free housing until they turn eighteen years old. When asked afterwards to provide evidence of this happening, Holt said that it was an anecdotal story told to him by a developer and that he had no evidence of this happening. A spokesperson for Governor Hogan said that he expressed his disappointment with Holt's \"unfortunate and inappropriate comment\" during a \"lengthy and very direct conversation\" afterwards, and multiple Democratic lawmakers signed onto a letter calling on Hogan to remove Holt from office; Hogan declined to do so. Holt apologized for his remarks the following day.\nPersonal life\nHolt is married has two children, including a daughter that he adopted while traveling with his wife to Russia to provide orphans with clothing and supplies following his defeat in the 1998 Maryland Senate election.\nElectoral history\n",

It is currently the healthcare unit of the Alibaba Group (Alibaba). \nHistory\nThe origins of the company can be traced back to Shui Hing, a Hong Kong retail company that was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1971.\nIn 1998, Shui Hing was sold to fashion retailer Easyknit International Holdings and was rebranded to Easy Concepts.\nIn 2000, CITIC Group acquired Easy Concepts and later renamed it to CITIC 21CN.\nIn January 2014, Alibaba and Yunfeng Capital acquired a controlling stake in CITIC 21CN for US$170\u00a0million.  It was speculated that the then-private Alibaba was using the acquisition for a reverse takeover so it could be listed in Hong Kong but according to people familiar with Alibaba, there was no intention to do so.  Alibaba stated the reason for the acquisition was because CITIC 21CN's drug data platform could help it expand into the healthcare industry. CITIC 21CN was subsequently renamed to Alibaba Health.\nIn 2015, Alibaba agreed to transfer the operations of its online pharmacy business from Tmall to AliHealth for US$2.5\u00a0billion of newly issued shares and convertible bonds. However AliHealth let the deal lapse due to regulatory uncertainties for online drug sales. In May 2018, Alibaba announced it will sell several of the healthcare categories on Tmall to AliHealth for US$1.35\u00a0billion.\nAin 2018, AliHealth made multiple investments in offline healthcare companies which included Guizhou Ensure, ShuYu Civilian Pharmacy Corporation and Huaren Health. AliHealth which had been making losses for multiple years, wanted to find ways to generate stable cash flows to improve profitability.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, AliHealth shares reached its highest point as it reported increased revenue due to direct sales. AliHealth which had been reporting net losses each year since inception had reported its first profitable year.\nIn November 2023, AliHealth stated it would acquire AJK Technology Holding Ltd from Taobao for US$1.73\u00a0billion. The deal would give it certain services of Alibaba's marketing tool to improve profitability.\nSee also\nAlibaba Group\n",
    "American artist (1938\u20131997)\nOlaf Odegaard (December 15, 1938 \u2013 December 25, 1997), better known by his pen name Olaf, was an American artist active in the latter half of the twentieth century, known for his explicit, homoerotic illustrations.\nOlaf's art explores themes such as the devil, satyrs, and BDSM, including master/slave relationships. He is most well known for his graphite pencil drawings.\nBiography\nOlaf was born in Wisconsin, where he attended Carroll College. He continued his education at Harvard Divinity School and the University of Tokyo, after which he obtained a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Hawaii.\nOlaf's work gained prominence through features in Drummer magazine.\nIn 1986, Olaf organized Naked Eyes, an artist showcase highlighting gay men's visual art for the International Gay and Lesbian Archives.\nOlaf reportedly lived a solitary life and struggled with housing insecurity. However, he developed close relationships with Jim Kepner and Durk Dehner, both of which supported Olaf at times to prevent him from becoming homeless. With Dehner's help, Olaf moved into a home in Silver Lake, Los Angeles.\nIn 1996, Dehner and the Tom of Finland Company published a 64-page book of Olaf's work entitled Beasts and Beauties: The Erotic Art of Olaf.\nCultural impact & legacy\nThe Tom of Finland Foundation proclaimed Olaf to be the \"erotic master of the graphite pencil\" and one of the \"greats\" among Tom of Finland, Etienne, and Domino.\nOlaf's remaining works were sold upon his death to fund his nephew's education. Although much of his art entered private collections, some of his works were acquired by the Leather Archives & Museum, ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives, Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, and Tom of Finland Foundation.\nIn 2015, Olaf's art was featured in The Stonewall Nation, a book and film by Sille Storihle exploring the history of the Stonewall Nation movement.\nIn 2016 Olaf's work was featured in a retrospective by the GLBT Historical Society entitled \"Stroke: From Under the Mattress to the Museum Walls.\" That same year he also featured in Cock, Paper, Scissors, an exhibition and book published by the ONE Archives in collaboration with the Leslie-Lohman Museum.\n",
    "\nSplatoon is a Japanese video game franchise with the premise of fictional bands and idol groups, whose members are voiced and performed by real-life musicians. As of 2024, the franchise is composed of three major idol groups: the Squid Sisters (who debuted in Splatoon in 2015), Off the Hook (Splatoon 2 in 2017), and Deep Cut (Splatoon 3 in 2022).\nOverview\nThe Splatoon franchise has produced live performances based on the idol groups in video games as a part of events like Niconico festivals and Nintendo Live.

    "Military unit\nThe 28th Mississippi Cavalry Regiment was a Confederate cavalry unit from Mississippi. The 28th Cavalry fought in numerous battles of the Western theater of the American Civil War before surrendering in Alabama on May 4, 1865.\nHistory\nPrivate J.M. Price, of Company E, 28th Mississippi Cavalry\nThe companies of the 28th Cavalry Regiment were organized in early 1862. Peter Burwell Starke, a state politician, was elected colonel, and Samuel W. Ferguson, a native of South Carolina and graduate of West Point was elected lieutenant colonel.  Ferguson had previously served in the South Carolina militia and was one of the officers who received the surrender of the US garrison after the Battle of Fort Sumter in April, 1861.\nIn May, the Regiment was sent to Vicksburg under the command of General Martin Luther Smith to aid in the defense of the city during an attack by Federal gunboats. The Regiment continued operations in the vicinity of Vicksburg for the rest of the year. Company I of the regiment, under Captain William H. Johnson, took part in the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou in December.\nIn January, 1863, the 28th Cavalry was assigned to General George B. Cosby's brigade and sent to Tennessee. The regiment was held in reserve during the Battle of Thompson's Station, then fought in the First Battle of Franklin in April, where the \"gallant and meritorious conduct\" of the Regiment was noted by General William Hicks Jackson. The 28th returned to Mississippi in June, and on June 22, the regiment fought a skirmish with the 4th Iowa Cavalry at Birdsong's ferry along the Big Black River. After the fall of Vicksburg on July 4, the 28th harassed Union forces advancing on Jackson, the state capital. For the rest of the year, the 28th fought skirmishes with Union forces across Mississippi.\nIn 1864, Col. Starke was promoted to command of a cavalry brigade, and Major Joshua T. McBee took command of the Regiment. The 28th clashed with Union General William T. Sherman's forces during the Meridian campaign. In April, a detachment of the 28th Cavalry was sent to Walker and Winston Counties in Alabama to arrest Southern Unionist \"tories\" in an area later known as the \"Republic of Winston\".\nIn May, the regiment was sent to Georgia to take part in the Atlanta Campaign, fighting at Adairsville, Cassville, Ezra Church, before moving on with the Confederate forces into Tennessee after the fall of Atlanta. The 28th fought in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign as part of General Nathan Bedford Forrest's Cavalry Corps, taking part in the battles of Columbia, Spring Hill, Franklin and Murfreesboro.\nAfter the Confederate losses in the Tennessee campaign, the 28th Cavalry moved into Alabama and fought a series of skirmishes there before surrendering on May 4, 1865.\nCommanders\nCommanders of the 28th Mississippi Cavalry:\nCol.

    "Genus of planthoppers\nRhotana is a large genus of planthoppers from the family Derbidae, tribe Rhotanini, with more than 70 species. Most species have been reported from the rainforests of Borneo, Indonesia and New Guinea, but the distribution of the genus extends over a much wider area in southern and south-eastern Asia, as far north as southern Japan and including parts of the Pacific islands as well as Australia. The species are the largest in the tribe Rhotanini, typically between 5\u20136 mm from head to the tip of the wings. The forewings frequently have striking patterns and colours, some species have also marks on the hind wings.\nType species: Rhotana latipennis Walker, 1857\nDistribution\nDistribution ranges of the species in the genus Rhotana (blue outline) and that of the type species, Rhotana latipennis (brown outline)\nMost of the species of Rhotana have been reported from the islands of Borneo (22 species including the type species) and the island of New Guinea (16 species). However, Rhotana has a much wider distribution, ranging from Sri Lanka (5 species) in the West, over southern parts of mainland Asia like Myanmar (1 species), north-eastern India (1 species), Laos (1 species), Vietnam (3 species), southern China (1 species) and Taiwan (6 species), to southern parts of Japan (2 species) in the North. In south-eastern Asia and the Australia/Pacific region, the distribution includes the remaining parts of Indonesia (13 species), the Philippines (8 species), New Caledonia (2 species), as well as northern and eastern parts of Australia (6 species). There is also one species reported from Samoa, further in the East.\nDescription\nHead and wings of Rhotana latipennis\nThe genus Rhotana is a diverse group of planthoppers with broad, often colourful forewings. The forewing venation is similar compared to that of its sister genus Levu, with 5 costal cells and 7 veins of the cubitus-media complex reaching the margin at the end of the wing. However, the forewings of Rhotana have a broader basal median cell, are more transparent and are not powdered. Only some patches on the wings may be powdered, see the image of Rhotana marmorata in the gallery below. In addition, the species are larger compared to those of Levu, reaching a length of 5\u20137 mm from head to the tip of the wings. However, the smallest species of Rhotana have a size similar to the largest species of Levu. The head has a rounded profile with 2 facial ridges which usually (but not always) meet near the junction between face and vertex.\nIn some species, the forewings are held in a roof-like position when the insects are at rest (see the gallery below), in others both wing surfaces form a common plane (see the taxobox at the top right). In the later case the insects often raise the wings in a way to display the marks on the hind wings. This wing position is not preserved in museum specimens and it is unknown how consistent it is among the different species and species groups. However, raising the wings seems to be associated with marks on the hind wings. This variation in the wing position is also found in the genus Levu but not in other genera of Rhotanini. Hind wing marks have not been described in other genera of the tribe Rhotanini.\nThe diversity of wing patterns and colourations among species of Rhotana is also noticeable. It ranges from forms like Rhotana albata and Rhotana ramentosa that are mainly straw-coloured to light brownish with few if any marks, to forms like Rhotana miles that are dark reddish-brown with red forewing veins. There may also be bright red marks on the head. The forewings can show various patterns like a series of conspicuous black dots or bright red marks. In a number of species, black marks on the hindwings may also be prominent. Some of these colour forms and wing patterns are shown in the gallery below: \nDiversity of forewing patterns in species of Rhotana\nRhotana gressittorum\nRhotana marmorata\nRhotana septemmaculata\nRhotana sp. possibly R. ramentosa\nBiology\nThere is almost no information on the biology of the species of Rhotana. It is assumed that the nymphal stages live in decaying organic matter like other derbids, feeding on fungi. Even information on the host plants the adults feed on is rare. In fact, host plant data seem to be available only for Rhotana excelsa which has been collected from coconut palms (Cocos nucifera) and abaca (Musa textile) in the Philippines.\nTaxonomy and species groups\nA total of 72 species of Rhotana have been described (as of 2024) and 52 of these have been assigned to 6 species groups, as they show obvious similarities in wing markings, colouration and vein patterns. These species groups are briefly described below and their main features are illustrated and in most cases marked by arrows:\nWings of Rhotana formosana showing characteristic marks (arrows)\nRhotana formosana species group - This group includes 5 species that are found in southern Japan, Taiwan, parts of mainland Asia (souther",
    "2016 musical\nLife After is a musical with music, lyrics, and book by Britta Johnson. Loosely inspired by Johnson's real-life experiences, the musical focuses on sixteen-year-old Alice Frank, who has to navigate life after the death of her father.\nPremise\nThe musical follows the story of Alice Carter, a teenage girl who is confronted with the unexpected death of her father, Frank Carter, a charismatic self-help author. As Alice attempts to understand her father's life and reconcile her feelings of anger, guilt, and sorrow, she is joined and supported by her mother Beth, her sister Kate, best friend Hannah, and her English teacher Ms. Hopkins. Alice slowly uncovers layers of her father's past that challenge her initial perceptions, leading her on a journey of self-discovery and acceptance.\nProduction history\nWorld premiere: Toronto\nLife After was first presented as part of the 2016 Toronto Fringe Festival. The musical was performed at the Theatre Passe Muraille from July 1\u201310, 2016. It won the Paul O\u2019Sullivan Prize for Musical Theatre, awarded to the best script, as well as the Patron's Pick for musical theatre.\nFollowing this success, it was developed into a full musical with The Musical Stage Company and the Canadian Stage Company, in Toronto. It began performances at the Berkeley Street Theatre on September 23, 2017, and was supposed to close on October 22, 2017. However, due to popular demand, the musical was extended by one week until October 29, 2017. This production was nominated for 12 Dora Awards, winning 6, including Best Musical Theatre Production and Best New Musical.\nSan Diego (2019)\nThe musical received its American premiere at The Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. It began performances on March 22, 2019, before closing on April 28, 2019. The musical starred Sophie Hearn as Alice Frank and Bradley Dean as Frank Carter, and was directed by Barry Edelstein.\nChicago (2022)\nLife After then played at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Performances began on June 11, 2022, and it closed on July 17, 2022. The production was further developed, and included an expanded set and new direction by Annie Tippe. It starred Samantha Williams as Alice Carter and Paul Alexander Nolan as Frank Carter.\nToronto (2025)\nIn May 2024, it was announced that Life After will return to Toronto, where it will play a limited engagement at the Ed Mirvish Theatre between April 16 and May 4, 2025.\nCast and characters\nMusical numbers\n\"Frank's Message #1\" \u2013 Frank\n\"Alice Finds Out\" \u2013 Beth, Kate, Hannah, Furies\n\"The Funeral\" \u2013 Beth, Kate, Hannah, Ms. Hopkins, Frank, Furies\n\"If I Knew\" \u2013 Alice, Furies\n\"Control What You Can\" \u2013 Kate, Alice, Beth, Frank\n\"Dedication #1\" \u2013 Beth, Furies\n\"Route 33\" \u2013 Frank\n\"The Party\" \u2013 Hannah, Frank, Alice, Furies\n\"Route 33 (reprise) / Beth and Kate at Home\" \u2013 Frank, Alice, Beth, Kate\n\"Back at School\" \u2013 Furies\n\"Forgive Yourself\" \u2013 Ms. Hopkins, Frank, Beth, Kate, Alice, Furies\n\"Frank's Message #2\" \u2013 Frank\n\"Dedication #2\" \u2013 Beth, Furies\n\"A Moment\" \u2013 Kate, Alice, Beth, Frank, Ms. Hopkins, Furies\n\"Frank on the Porch\" \u2013 Frank, Furies\n\"Moving\" \u2013 Ms. Hopkins\n\"Wallpaper\" \u2013 Beth\n\"Will I Grow?\" \u2013 Alice, Furies\n\"Snow\" \u2013 Alice, Frank\n\"Poetry\" \u2013 Alice\nCritical reception\nThe 2017 world premiere production in Toronto received widespread critical acclaim.\nCarly Maga of the Toronto Star praised Johnson's ability to portray the \"overwhelming, surreal nature of grief\", and commented that the musical's emotions rivaled that of more traditional, full-length plays. Taylor Long, writing for BroadwayWorld, said that the show is \"musical theatre perfection\" and that \"the quality of the orchestra, especially with Reza Jacobs shaping the music, rivals anything you hear on Broadway.\" J. Kelly Nestruck of The Globe and Mail similarly praised the musical, comparing it favorably to similarly themed musicals such as Next to Normal and Dear Evan Hansen.\nReviewing the 2019 San Diego production for The San Diego Union-Tribune, James Hebert called the show a \"luminous new musical\" and praised Johnson's songwriting and storytelling, the cast's performances, as well as the musical orchestrations.\nAwards and nominations\n",
    "The 1988 Panamanian coup attempt was a failed coup d'\u00e9tat in Panama, led by the country's police chief Colonel Leonidas Macias, which aimed to seize control of the central military headquarters. Allegedly instigated by the United States, the coup attempt led to widespread looting and protests in Panama City which were quelled by paramilitary gangs and security forces. The media faced harassment for covering the failed coup, with several journalists being detained or beaten by the authorities or government supporters.\nCoup attempt\nThe coup attempt followed three weeks of protests by public sector workers over unpaid wages, who staged work stoppages and blockades. In response, the government issued a communique and placed the military in charge of key struck government facilities - the electric power, water and telephone companies, national railroad, and seaports and airports - to mitigate the most severe effects of the strikes.\nAmidst escalating anti-government sentiments, Colonel Leonidas Macias along with other dissident officers staged a coup attempt at around 6:30 AM on March 16, 1988. Aiming to seize control of the military's central headquarters, the colonel attempted to convince the 4th Infantry Company and riot police leaders through his authority to support the revolt. Despite his best efforts however, the police force remained staunchly loyal to Manuel Noriega. By 7 AM, the coup had been thwarted and the headquarters was secured by the Battalion 2000, a specially trained group. The ten officers involved in the coup were arrested and forced into retirement, including Colonels Leonidas Macias, Bernardo Barrera, Majors Fernando Quezada, Aristides Valdonedo, Jaime Benitez, and Captain Humberto Macea. To reassert his authority, Noriega replaced Colonel Leonidas Macias with Colonel Eros Ramios Cal as the new police chief.\nPost-coup\nFollowing the coup attempt, the country's capital of Panama City erupted into further protests and riots, leading to widespread street violence and looting. Barricades were erected, cars were burned, and shops were looted. Government forces, using birdshot and tear gas, successfully restored order with the help of paramilitary gangs and plainclothes agents.\nInitially denying the coup repeatedly, government spokesman Major Edgardo Lopez finally confirmed the coup later on, calling it a \"Kamikaze attack\" instigated by the United States by highlighting how most of the coup plotters received recent military training in the US. Meanwhile, about an hour after the aborted coup attempt, a relaxed Noriega appeared at the headquarters building and addressed reporters questioning the gunfire, mocking the attempted coup by saying \"They were kisses.\"\nThe government repressed the press for covering the abortive coup, detaining three members of a British television crew and an ABC News producer. Additionally, a Mexican television cameraman and two other foreign reporters were beaten by government supporters. Associated Press (AP) reporters were also held at gunpoint before being released, with the soldiers claiming they were participating in a \"simulated exercise.\"\n",
    "Archaeological site in Saga, Japan\nThe Hizen Provincial Capital site (\u80a5\u524d\u56fd\u5e81\u8de1, Hizen Kokuch\u014d ato) is an archaeological site consisting of the ruins of the Nara period to early Heian period Provincial Capital of Hizen Province, located in the Yamato neighborhood of the city of Saga, San'y\u014d region of Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1989.\nOverview\nFollowing the Taika Reform (645 AD)  which aimed at a centralization of the administration following the Chinese model (ritsury\u014d), provincial capitals were established in the various provinces, headed by an official titled kokushi, who replaced the older Kuni no miyatsuko. With a square layout, the provincial capitals were patterned after  the Capital of Japan, first Fujiwara-ky\u014d and then Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, which in turn were modelled on the Tang capital Chang'an, but on a much, much smaller scale. Each had office buildings for administration, finance, police and military and the official building of the governor, as well as granaries for tax rice and other taxable produce. In the periphery there was the provincial temple (kokubun-ji), and nunnery (kokubun-niji) and the garrison. This system collapsed with the growth of feudalism in the Late Heian period, and the location of many of the provincial capitals is now lost.\nThe Hizen Provincial Capital was located on an alluvial terrace formed by the Kase River, which originates in the Sefuri Mountains in the western part of the Chikushi Plain. Archaeological excavations were carried out over a ten-year period starting in 1975, and the scale and internal structure of the provincial office from the early 8th century to the early 10th century has become clear. The provincial office measured 77.2 meters east-to-west and 104.5 meters north-to-south. Only the foundations of the south gate has been discovered, which measured approximately 9.7 by 5.3 meters and was 6.8 meters tall. It has been rebuilt twice, initially as a post-hole building but eventually converted into a stone-foundation building. All the buildings discovered within the provincial office grounds are post-hole buildings. Relics discovered include a large amount of earthenware such as sue ware and haji ware, as well as roof tiles. Although some pottery dating from the latter half of the 7th century has been excavated, the overwhelming majority of the remains are from the 8th century, especially the latter half, with not many from the 9th or 10th centuries. The layout of the buildings resembles that of the Dazaifu complex on a smaller scale, with the front hall, main hall, and rear hall lined up on the central north\u2013south axis, and two side halls are located on each side of the front hall. Corridors are attached to the east and west of the main hall, dividing the bailey into north and south, and the south gate is an eight-legged gate that bends the embankment inward. Currently, the site has been developed as a park, and the south gate and earthen walls (10 meters on both wings) have been restored. There is also a museum on site. .\nAround the Hizen Provincial Office ruins, there are numerous other contemporary ruins, including the foundations for a cluster of buildings thought to be the taxation storehouses, buildings thought to be the provincial governor's residence, and a government office-related building group consisting of three long podium-based buildings.\nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Saga)\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Hizen Kokufu.\nHistoric Cultural Archives of Saga (in Japanese)\nSaga City home page (in Japanese)\n",

    "Television station in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nTV Santos was the first inland television station in Brazil and also the first outside of a state capital, as well as the fourth in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo overall. Headquartered in Santos, the station operated on channel 5 and was owned by Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Victor Costa, owners of TV Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nHistory\nTV Santos emerged thanks to an agreement between R\u00e1dio Clube de Santos and Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Victor Costa, owner of TV Paulista, at a time when 4,000 television sets installed in Santos received the signals of the three stations coming from the state capital with precarious reception. The transmitter was installed at Serra do Mar, with its tower at Ilha Porchat and also the first to operate entirely with Brazilian equipment, from local company Rebratel. It was formally inaugurated on November 15, 1957, with the participation of renowned national and international radio and television artists. The launch coincided with the 86th anniversary of the proclamation of the republic in Brazil. The inaugural broadcast ended at 11pm. OVC also had the plans to launch TV Excelsior on channel 9 in S\u00e3o Paulo, which ultimately launched in 1960 under the control of the Simonsen family.\nThe station generated local programming in the morning and afternoon hours, relaying TV Paulista in the evening (at launching time, TV Paulista opened at 3pm). One of its early programs was Discopa Musical, sponsored by the local record store Discopa.\nThe station also aired news bulletins sponsored by Discopa, cartoons, musical programming and local content. On December 31, 1957, the station received a visit from Hebe Camargo, \"the Star of S\u00e3o Paulo\", who worked at TV Paulista at the time, and was set to host the New Year's special on R\u00e1dio Clube de Santos later that evening. That same day, the local programming started at approximately 11:30am and ended at 1:55pm. This constrained schedule would last until the expansion of its transmissions, whereas TV Santos would sign off at 2pm in order to give airtime to TV Paulista.\nThe station also paved way for Of\u00e9lia Anunciato's television cooking career, as well as other celebrities such as Manuel de N\u00f3brega and Chocolate (Show Panex com Chocolate).\nThe station was plagued by difficulties that also affected its sister radio station, which was later sold. The businessmen opted to end the local programming, becoming a mere relayer of TV Paulista in 1960. In 1964, when the military dictatorship started, there were concerns over a potential television station in Santos carrying \"subversive ideology\". TV Paulista was later sold to TV Globo becoming TV Globo S\u00e3o Paulo, and for almost thirty years, there was no locally generated television station.\nToday, Globo has an affiliate in Santos, TV Tribuna.\n",

Morgan and Murphy would produce three albums together from 1958 to 1960, This Could Be the Start of Something, Mark Murphy's Hip Parade, and Playing the Field. Murphy told Will Friedwald that he went to California \"looking for places to work. Instead, to his surprise, instead of getting gigs, he got the chance to make the three albums for Capitol\".\nIn the liner notes James Gavin tells how Murphy was staying at the YMCA, searching for work as a singer, when he got his second career break in 1958. Murphy said it was, \"The year I was starving in Hollywood \u2013 literally. As soon as I signed the contract I went over to this cafeteria, just sliced that turkey, and ate an enormous meal.\" Gavin wrote, \"Walking back to the Y, he fantasized about becoming the male version of his idol Peggy Lee, who combined pop stardom with an illustrious jazz reputation\".\nRecording\nJazz musician and arranger Bill Holman was Murphy's personal choice for musical director and arranger for the albums. Murphy knew of him from his work with Stan Kenton, and he was a favorite of Peggy Lee, who Murphy idolized. Peggy Lee wrote the liner notes for Mark Murphy's Hip Parade where she described Murphy's vocal approach, \"He phrases like a horn, and a horn with a modern sound\". Bill Holman described Murphy's role in the arranging process in the liner notes to This Could Be the Start of Something, \"First, being a good piano player, he went into the Capitol studios and recorded a demonstration of each tune the way he heard it, accompanying himself. Second, he knew the exact feeling he wanted on each section of each tune. For example, he was able to indicate where the conga drum should or should not be used to get the sound he wanted . . . equal arranging credit should go to him\".\nProducer Morgan and director Holman used many famous West Coast jazz musicians on the recordings. Pianist Jimmy Rowles appears on all three albums. He was a noted accompanist for singers such as Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Jo Stafford, Anita O'Day, and Julie London. The rest of the rhythm section on these albums included bassist Joe Mondragon, and drummers Mel Lewis, Stan Levy, and Shelly Manne. All of them worked with Peggy Lee. The trumpeters and brothers Pete and Conte Candoli appeared on many of the recordings.\nThe albums include Murphy in trio settings, small jazz band settings, and with pop background vocals. He records some of his first scat solos, standards from the Great American Songbook, and recent pop hits that they attempt to make hip, as well as attempts at new hit singles.\nJames Gavin curated the selections for this release. Ellington's \"I Didn't Know About You\" was a song Murphy heard Nicky DeFrancis perform at \"Jilly\" Rizzo's 52nd street bar Jilly's Saloon. Murphy said, \"He was fantastic \u2013 played like Erroll Garner and sang like the Italian singers in Philadelphia, where he was from. He did the hippest tunes in New York at that time, like \"I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry\" and \"I Didn't Know About You\". If you asked for them, everyone knew you were hip. That's why they sometimes appeared in my records\".\nOne of Capitol Records founders, Buddy DeSylva, is covered with his \"Wishing (Will Make It So)\" which is from 1939's Love Affair co-starring Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. A Murphy favorite, \"Put the Blame on Mame\" is a song featured in the 1946 film noir Gilda in which Rita Hayworth lip synched to Anita Ellis' vocal recording. Murphy adds a few original lines. Murphy and Producer Tom Morgan thought it had potential to be a hit single but Capitol refused to release and promote it as a single. Murphy said, \"By that time they had given up on me. They released the album and said Goodbye\".\nThe Best of the Capitol Years also features \"The Blacksmith Blues\" which was never released by Capitol until now. The tune was a hit for Ella Mae Morse. The song \"This Could Be the Start of Something\" by Steve Allen was a minor hit for Murphy. But album sales were weak, critical reception was tepid and the reviews were mixed. Murphy said, \"I had tried to compromise, which of course was a mistake. People who wanted those songs didn't want to hear me, and people who liked me didn't want to hear those songs . . . We were kind of traumatized.\" \"I'm an alternative singer. In those days we didn't know what to call it\", Murphy told Gavin.\nMurphy's biographer Peter Jones points out that Murphy had grown up and matured with bebop and swing, but he was now trying to achieve stardom in the mainstream commercial record market. \"That seemed to mean presenting himself as a young hipster, a swing",
    "Chinese solar photovoltaic company\nSungrow Power Supply (Sungrow; Chinese: \u9633\u5149\u7535\u6e90; pinyin: Y\u00e1nggu\u0101ng Di\u00e0nyu\u00e1n) is a publicly listed Chinese solar photovoltaic (PV) inverter manufacturing company headquartered in Hefei, Anhui.\nBackground\nCao Renxian was a teacher at Hefei University of Technology. Dissatisfied with his job, in 1997 at the age of 30 Cao resigned from his position to start his own business in renewable energy despite his peers dissuading him as he had only just gotten married. Cao saved 80,000 yuan and obtained 500,00 yuan from friends and relative to start the business. He rented a room of less than 20 square meters next to a bathhouse opposite the school which was where Sungrow was established.\nWhen the business first started, renewable energy was only in its infancy stage and therefore Sungrow could only make traditional established products rather than developing ones.  It encountered obstacles due to the weather. The turning point came in 2002 when the Chinese government started a solar energy project to brings electricity to remote villages in Northwestern China. Sungrow participated in the project which allowed it to rapidly develop.\nDue to the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis, photovoltaic power stations had financing difficulties and support in European countries suddenly stopped leading to a decline in industry demand. In 2011, China's photovoltaic production had excess capacity leading to drop in prices for materials and components. However Sungrow went against the trend wheres its profit  increased tenfold between 2008 and 2011.\nIn November 2011, Sungrow held its initial public offering and became a listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\nSungrow has played a significant role in Targeted Poverty Alleviation via photovoltaics. In April 2016, General Secretary Xi Jinping visited Anhui province and affirmed Sungrow's contribution to the project.\nIn 2017, Sungrow built the Sungrow Huainan Solar Farm which at the time was the largest floating solar farm in the world. It produced enough energy to power 15,000 homes which was double capacity of the solar farm (built by Xinyi Solar) previously considered the world's biggest.\nIn August 2018, Sungrow opened a factory in Bangalore, India. This would be its largest solar inverter manufacturing base built overseas.\nIn July 2023, The Australian reported concerns on how Sungrow which had links to the Chinese Government was one of the largest suppliers in the Australian solar inverter market.\nIn March 2024, Sungrow surpassed its rival LONGi Green Energy Technology as the world's most valuable solar sector company. Sungrow benefited from China's boom in battery-storage capacity leading to higher revenues.\nSee also\nLONGi Green Energy Technology\nXinyi Solar\nSolar power in China\n",
    "French naval officer (1896\u20131977)\nRobert Jaujard (French pronunciation: ; 6 March 1896 \u2013 25 January 1977) was a French naval officer.\nLife\nBorn into a Protestant family from Sainte-Foy-la-Grande (Gironde), his father was a pastor and would later become a navy chaplain.\nHe got his start in the navy in September 1914 as a seaman on the Duguay-Trouin. He was promoted boatswain's mate (ma\u00eetre de man\u0153uvre) aboard the armoured cruiser Jeanne-d'Arc in March 1915. He entered the \u00c9cole navale in September of that same year and left as a midshipman (aspirant) in April 1916. He then embarked on the destroyer Aspirant-Herber in the Mediterranean Sea.\nHaving become ensign first-class in April 1918, Jaujard found himself aboard the Condorcet and the Pothuau that same year, and on the Lorraine the next. Then, in 1920, he served on the armoured cruiser Montcalm, where he was noticed by Admiral Jules-Th\u00e9ophile Docteur.\nAfter becoming a navy lieutenant in January 1921, he belonged to the navy's Far East divisional general staff under Fran\u00e7ois Darlan, who took him along as first mate on an aviso that functioned as a piloting school, named the Chamois (1922\u20131923). He thereafter embarked on the Ancre (1924) and was then sent to the general staff of the maritime prefect of Rochefort, embarking once again on the battleship Lorraine in December 1925, this time as officer in charge of ship's movements (officier de man\u0153uvre).\nIn 1926, he commanded the oil tanker Var in the Mediterranean, and then became officer in charge of ship's movements on the Jeanne-d'Arc, and next on the Edgar-Quinet, always under Darlan (1927\u20131928), before embarking as executive officer on the torpedo boat Boulonnais in 1929.\nHaving become corvette captain in 1931 and being assigned as deputy commander of the cruiser Foch at Brest, Jaujard commanded the torpedo boat Fortun\u00e9 of the Mediterranean squadron in 1933\u20131934, and in 1935 supervised work at the new \u00c9cole navale campus in Brest. He was then named head of internal and security service  on the battleship Dunkerque and his work aboard ship was officially deemed satisfactory.\nHaving become frigate captain in 1937, he commanded the destroyer Vauquelin in the Mediterranean and then became first mate on the cruiser Alg\u00e9rie in 1940. He then got himself noticed at the time of Op\u00e9ration Vado (which involved bombarding the port at Genoa) and was thus cited for his sang-froid (roughly, calmness in the face of danger) and his tactical skill.\nAfter becoming captain (\"capitaine de vaisseau\") in July 1941, Jaujard was first second-in-command on the general staff of Southern Maritime Forces at Algiers. In January 1943, he was commanding the cruiser Georges Leygues in the Free French forces. The German auxiliary cruiser Portland was sunk on 13 April 1943 in the South Atlantic Ocean as it was trying to run the Allied blockade.\nBy January 1944, Jaujard was commanding the navy at Algiers.\nBy March of the same year, he had risen to rear admiral (contre-amiral), and two months later, he was commanding the IV Cruiser Division, and he took part in the Normandy landings on D-Day (6 June 1944), successfully bombarding the German positions at Port-en-Bessin. In August 1944, he likewise took part in Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Provence on the fifteenth of that month. While in command of the so-called Flank Force, a unit that brought together cruisers and fighter aircraft, he supported Allied armies' progress on the Italian coast.\nAfter World War II, in whose wake he reached the rank of vice admiral in April 1946, he held the position of Major General of the Navy (a job title rather than a rank). In 1947, he commanded the Richelieu group and the intervention force. He was \"NATO Admiral\u00a0\u2014 Western Europe\" in 1948, and then \"Admiral\u00a0\u2014 Central Europe\" in 1951.\nHe took the rank and title of squadron vice admiral in September 1952. He was highly esteemed by Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1954, he was named a titular member of the Armed Forces High Council.\nJaujard was transferred to the \"second section\" (for French officers no longer on active duty, but still kept at the armed forces minister's disposal should they be needed) in April 1956. He died on 25 January 1977 in Toulon.\nHonours\nIn addition to the awards bestowed upon him by the French Republic and others, as detailed in the information box, a street in Toulon, Rue Amiral Jaujard, has been named in Jaujard's honour.\n",

    "Islamic scholar (1945 \u2013 2018)\nAlam Faqri (born Alam Hussain; 13 September 1945 \u2013 28 March 2018, Urdu: \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0641\u0642\u0631\u06cc) was an Barelvi Islamic scholar and prolific writer. He authored several books on the biographies of Muslim saints and teachings of Islam. His works are known for their simplicity and accessibility. One of his books is \u201cFaqri Majmua e Wazaif,\u201d which focuses on Quranic Surahs and verses for supplications and spiritual practices. He belonged to the Barelvi movement of Sunni Islam.\nBiography\nHis original name was Alam Hussain, but he became known as Alam Faqri in the academic world. He was born on Thursday 5th Shawwal 13 September 1945 in Lahore in Chah Meeran neighborhood adjacent to Miran Hussain Zanjani's court.\nFaqri was admitted to the Municipal Corporation School in Chah Meran, where he studied up to the fifth standard. He then continued his education from the 6th to the 10th standard at Islamia High School, Misri Shah. In 1963, he passed the matriculation examination with distinction and received a scholarship. He passed the FA examination in 1965 and the BA examination in 1967. In 1969, he completed his MA in Islamiat and subsequently obtained an MA in Urdu. He passed the LLB (Advocate Degree) examination in 1975.\nFaqri received his Nazra education of the Holy Quran from Imam Masjid Darbar Hazrat Meeran Hussain Zanjani and also received elementary Arabic grammar lessons. Near his home, Maulana Mufti Maher Din, who taught the Quran and Hadith, provided instruction in the translation and Tafsir of the Holy Quran.\nViews and thoughts\nFaqri used to say that after acquiring knowledge, he developed a passion for writing books. To prepare for this, he studied several basic religious texts, including Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Tafsir Naaimi, Tafsir Rooh al-Bayan, Tafsir Mozahari, and Tafsir Zia-ul-Qur'an, among other commentaries. In addition to these interpretations, he also studied major hadith collections such as Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawud, Sunan Ibn Majah, Sunan Tirmidhi, Mishkawat al-Masabih, Isha'at al-Lama'at, and Mazar-e-Haqq. By studying these books, he expanded his academic thinking.\nWhen Faqri wrote books, he used sources for Quranic verses, blessed hadiths, Shariah issues, and other matters to ensure that his writings were accurate according to the Hanafi school of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama'at. He wanted anyone who read his books to find rich in academic depth. He began writing and compiling books in 1974. His writing style was very simple, and he avoided difficult words as much as possible to make it easy for readers to understand. Alam Faqri wrote about 260 books.\nSelected works\nHe has written many Islamic books, including:\nMazameen e Quran\nHadees e faqri\nFaqri Majmua wazaif\nRohani Majmua Wazaif\nKhazina Drood Sharif\nALLAH ki muhabat\nTasawuf ka rasta\n12 mah ki nafli ibadat\nTareeqa Haj-o-umrah\nQurani Duain\nQabar ki pehli raat\nDeath\nHe died on Wednesday 10 Rajab 1439 AH on 28 March 2018 before Azan-e-Fajr at the age of 73.\n",
    "2008 murder of a kindergarten teacher in Singapore\nOn 7 July 2008, at Ang Mo Kio West Garden in Singapore, 22-year-old movement operator Pathip Selvan Sugumaran murdered his 18-year-old girlfriend and kindergarten teacher Jeevitha Panippan, who sustained 15 bodily injuries during the stabbing, and three of the wounds led to Jeevitha's death. Pathip was arrested and charged with murder, and during his trial itself, it was revealed that both Jeevitha and Pathip's relationship was deteriorating due to Jeevitha having gone out with many other men, and Jeevitha had once reported to the police that Pathip raped her even though they had consensual sex.\nAccording to Pathip, on that night itself, he wanted to give his girlfriend a present and propose to her and forgive her for the infidelity. He even brought along a knife with a plan to threaten her into seeking forgiveness and coming back to him. However, Jeevitha did not do so and instead, she insulted Pathip, stating that her new lover was a better lover and he performed better than Pathip when on bed with her, which caused Pathip to stab her to death in a fit of anger.\nPathip was sentenced to death in November 2010, after the High Court rejected his defences of grave and sudden provocation and diminished responsibility and therefore convicted him of murder. Upon his appeal, however, the Court of Appeal found Pathip not guilty of murder, as they accepted that he was indeed being gravely provoked by Jeevitha's insults and it caused him to lose self-control and kill the victim. As a result, in August 2012, Pathip's death sentence and murder conviction were both set aside, and he was instead sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for a lesser charge of manslaughter.\nBackground of Pathip and Jeevitha\nPathip Selvan Sugumaran, alias Marsiling Baby or Woodlands Baby, was born in Singapore in 1986. Pathip was the second of four children in his family, and he had an older brother, a younger brother and a younger sister. Pathip's parents divorced when he was only five years old. From 1992 to 1996, Pathip and his two brothers lived at the Sri Ramakrishna Mission Boys\u2019 Home after the divorce and during his childhood, Pathip stayed with his maternal grandmother. In the following years leading up to the murder of Pathip's girlfriend in 2008, Pathip had lived with his mother, stepfather and maternal grandparents.\nPathip completed his N-levels and graduated from secondary school, before he enrolled into the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and studied for a diploma in electrical engineering. However, he dropped out from his course in his second year. Afterwards, Pathip served his mandatory two-year National Service as a fireman in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) before he was discharged in January 2007. He would later go to work as a movement operator in his uncle's company.\nIn December 2007, through a mutual friend Suresh, Pathip first met his girlfriend Jeevitha Panippan (also known as \"Jeev\" or \"Ashley\"), who was an 18-year-old kindergarten teacher studying for her O-levels as a private candidate. Pathip and Jeevitha were initially friends before this developed into a romantic relationship, and Pathip did not mind this even though he knew that Jeevitha had up to 16 boyfriends at the time he first met her. As they grew closer, Pathip eventually introduced Jeevitha to his family in April 2008, but Pathip's family disapproved of the couple's relationship. Additionally, Jeevitha often asked Pathip to give her money and the couple's relationship was a defining factor that strained the relationship between Pathip and his family. At one point, in May 2008, Pathip even deferred his application to enroll into a part-time course in Petroleum and Chemical Process Technology at ITE College East and gave Jeevitha the money meant for his own school fee.\nFatal stabbing of Jeevitha\nFrom May 2008 onwards, the relationship between Pathip and Jeevitha began to deteriorate, and they often got into arguments due to Jeevitha hanging out with multiple men and Pathip, who allegedly grew more possessive of Jeevitha, having caught her on bed several times with other male strangers. Often, they would reconcile each time it happened, and on many occasions, Pathip used a knife to threaten her and Jeevitha would apologize to him and seek forgiveness and the matter would thus come to a close. An ex-boyfriend of Jeevitha had once heard from Jeevitha that Pathip had been possessive of her, and she accused Pathip for pressuring her to have sex with him. Jeevitha's god-brother and friends described Pathip as \"possessive\" and easily became \"jealous\" whenever he saw Jeevitha talking or hanging out with other males.\nOn one occasion, Jeevitha and Pathip had unprotected sex, and although Pathip assured the fearful Jeevitha that even if she got pregnant as she feared, Pathip still loved her and would marry her, Jeevitha still went to file a complaint to the police, falsely accusing Pathip of raping her e",
    "Urban square in Szczecin, Poland\nThe Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz Square is an urban square in Szczecin, Poland, in the neighbourhood of Centrum, within the Downtown district, between Pope John Paul II Avenue, Independence Avenue, and Aviators Square. It was opened in 2019.\nHistory\nThe monument dedicated to William I at the square in 1900.\nThe current Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz Square was originally formed as part of the White Parade Square, sometime between 1725 and 1745, by filling the sections of the moat with the rubble from the former city walls. It was renamed to King Square in 1809, and to the Polish Soldier Square in 1945.\nIn 1874, there was constructed the Emperor William Street (now John Paul II Avenue), begging at the square. On 1 November 1894, at the square was unvailed the monument dedicated to William I, emperor of Germany from 1871 to 1888. It was designed by sculptor Karl Hilgers. It consisted of the bronze statue of the emperor on a horse, placed on a stone pedestal, with bronse sculptures of the soldiers around it.\nDuring the World War II, the statues of the soldiers in the monument were taken down to be melted for materials. After the end of the war, on 31 July 1945, the monument was torn down by the Polish inhabitants of the city. The statue was then taken to Denmark and melted. It was used to manufacture the replica of the Prince J\u00f3zef Antoni Poniatowski Monument in Warsaw, that was destroyed during the war.\nThe Monument of Graduate to the Soviet Army at the square in 1978.\nIn its place, on 26 April 1950, was unvailed the Monument of Graduate to the Soviet Army. It consisted of a 17-metre-tall obelisk made from reinforced concrete covered in sandstone tiles, a sculpture of a soldrier and worker holding hands, and a concrete sculpture of a Soviet five-side star on the top. Unvailed in the 5th anniversary of the city being captured by the Red Army in World War II, the monument was dedicated to the Soviet soldiers that fought in the conflict. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, and decommunization of Poland, the monument attracted many controversies and calls for its deconstructio, being seen as the symbol of Soviwt control of the country. The Soviet star was taken down in 1992, and the entire monument was deconstructed in November 2017.\nIn 2019, part of the Polish Soldier Square, located between Pope John Paul II Avenue, Independence Avenue, and Aviators Square, which previously included the Monument of Graduate to the Soviet Army, was separated into a new separate Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz Square. It was named after Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz, mayor of Gda\u0144sk from 1998 until his assassination in 2019. The square was renovated and rebuilt, and opened on 27 September 2019.\nThe name proposal caused controversies and disagreement from the Law and Justice party members and its voters, due to supposed Adamowicz's tax evasion allegations. There were unsuccessful attempts to propose renaming the square after Roman Dmowski, or removing any name whatsoever.\nCharacteristics\nThe Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz Square has the form of a small oblong rectangle, forming a street island within the Pope John Paul II Avenue.

    "Church in Nova Scotia, Canada\nFirst Baptist Church is a Baptist church (named Granville Street Baptist Church until 1886)  in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nEarly history\nThe church was established in Halifax Nova Scotia in September 1827, under the name Granville Street Baptist Church.\nThe individuals who organized it were originally members of the congregation of St. Paul's Anglican Church. Rev. Dr. Twining, an Anglican prothonotary at the time, experienced a shift in his views after being exposed to the teachings of Isaac Temple, private chaplain to Lord Dalhousie. Twining's sermons no longer appealed to John Inglis, the then-rector of St. Paul's, who dismissed Twining from the curacy of the parish. Following the controversy at St. Paul's, Twining, J.W. Nutting, and J. Ferguson left and adopted the Baptist faith. They briefly worshipped at the Baptist church under John Burton, the first known Baptist in the city. The new Baptists purchased land on Granville Street and formed their congregation in a stone chapel that was erected for \u00a32,250. The first baptism was given by Irah Chase on September 30, 1827, on the shores of the Bedford Basin. The following day, Alexis Caswell was ordained as pastor, while Lewis Johnston and J.W. Nutting were chosen as deacons.\nCaswell, alongside deacons Nutting and Johnston, and E.A. Crawley, were sent as delegates to the Baptist association in Wolfville. Their advocacy for a higher education initiative helped lay the foundation for the establishment of Acadia University in 1838. The founding members also had close ties to traditional Baptists in New England.\nFirst Baptist Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia\nBy 1886, the congregation outgrew its building and built a church at the corner of Queen Street and Spring Garden Road. It was a brick building that was semicircular and could hold 700 people in a spacious audience room. There was also a general gallery and a choir gallery behind the preacher's desk. The building was built for $31,000, and the land cost $6,000.\nFollowing the Act of Incorporation passed by the local legislature in May 1886, the name would change to the First Baptist Church. The newly constructed church celebrated its inaugural service on April 10, 1887.\nIn 1942, a fire damaged the new building, which was rebuilt in 1950.\nThe First Baptist Church is now located at 1300 Oxford Street in Halifax.\n",
    "Subgenre of hip hop\nFrat rap is a subgenre of hip hop music that emerged in the late 2000s. Asher Roth's 2009 song \"I Love College\" is considered the progenitor of the subgenre, which is characterized by a basic rhyming style, a sing-songy cadence, and lyrics about debaucherous parties, doing drugs, and women. Frat rap quickly became commercially popular among a predominately white, college-aged, suburban male audience in the northeastern United States, and notable frat rappers such as Mac Miller and Lil Dicky later became successful in mainstream hip hop.\nHistory\nThe subgenre of frat rap was invented by Asher Roth with the release of his song \"I Love College\" in 2009. The subgenre grew rapidly and achieved commercial success within hip hop by 2010. In 2010, 18-year-old Mac Miller released two mixtapes K.I.D.S. and Best Day Ever that made him an overnight success and launched him to the forefront of the frat rap phenomenon. In 2011, Aer's debut EP What You Need debuted atop the iTunes Hip-Hop/Rap albums chart, and Mac Miller drawing more than 50,000 fans to Government Center in Boston.\nHoodie Allen's first two albums, People Keep Talking in 2014 and Happy Camper in 2016, landed at number 2 and number 1 on the Billboard rap charts. Lil Dicky's 2015 album Professional Rapper was certified as a gold. By 2015, frat rappers were collaborating with mainstream rap artists such as Snoop Dogg, Quan, and Fetty Wap.\nMany of the most successful frat rap artists rejected the title and culture of frat rap and went on to release music that departed from the subject matter and sound of frat rap, being commercially successful in mainstream hip hop. Originally starting out in frat rap, Mac Miller later changed his sound and later became the most successful former frat rapper in mainstream hip hop, with a review of Rolling Stone stating that Miller had shed his frat rap reputation with the release of his album Swimming (Mac Miller album).\nDescription\nFrat rappers and their audience were predominantly white, college-aged, suburban males, with the New England region of the United States producing the most frat rappers. The songs had basic rhyming style, a sing-songy cadence, and lyrics about debaucherous parties, doing drugs, and women.\nNotable artists\nFrat rap was heavily dominated by white rappers, including Roth, Sammy Adams, Hoodie Allen, Chris Webby, OnCue, Cam Meekins, Lil Dicky, Aer, Mike Stud, and Huey Mack.\n",
    "Former lifeboat station in County Louth, Ireland\nBlackrock Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, located in the village of Blackrock, on the south side of Dundalk Bay, in County Louth, Ireland. \nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1859 following the Mary Stoddard disaster. It is one of two stations that have been home to the 'Dundalk lifeboat', the other being at Giles Quay.\nThe Blackrock Lifeboat Station was closed in 1935.\nHistory\nA storm, which is described in the Shipwreck Inventory of Ireland as 'one of the worst storms to have hit the coastlines of County Louth', began on Tuesday 6 April 1858, and did not subside until the following Sunday. The barque Mary Stoddart was seen in distress in Dundalk Bay on the 6 April 1858. Numerous attempts were made over 5 days to rescue the crew, and 4 men lost their lives in the rescue efforts. The Captain and nine crewmen were finally rescued by H.M. Coastguard Chief Boatman Robert Shankey and his boat crew from Giles Quay on the 9 and 10 April, but seven crewmen of the Mary Stoddart were lost.\nNo fewer than 10 RNLI Silver Medals were awarded for the rescue efforts, and a memorial was erected in Roden place, Dundalk, in memory of those men who gave their lives.\nIn Memory\nof\nCaptain James Kelly\nGerald Hughes\nJames Crosbey\nand\nJames Murphy\nwho lost their lives\nin a Noble and Humble Effort\nto rescue the crew of the Barque\nMary Stoddart\nwrecked in Dundalk Bay\non 9 April 1858\nMemorial, Roden Place Dundalk\nAs a result of this disaster, the RNLI promised to place a lifeboat in the Dundalk area, on finding a suitable location. Lord Clermont had a lifeboat house built at his own expense at Blackrock, and a 30-foot Self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with oars and sail, was placed there by the RNLI in 1859.\nA first service for the Blackrock lifeboat came on 19 September 1859, giving assistance to the vessel John James of the Isle of Man. A call on 22 August 1861 to the barque Frederick, on passage from Dublin to the West Indies, but wrecked at Dundalk harbour entrance, resulted in 21 lives being saved.\nFunded by children attending Sunday School, a new lifeboat Stockport Sunday Schools was placed at Blackrock in the summer of 1867. This boat was launched on the 2 July 1873, to the Glasgow barque Prince of Wales (recorded locally as the Princess of Wales), aground 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) south of the lighthouse, and rescued 16 people. The wreck was a hazard to shipping for 20 years, and was eventually blown up.\nIn 1877, it was thought that the Dundalk lifeboat would be better sited at Giles Quay (now Gyles Quay), on the north side of Dundalk Bay. RNLB Stockport Sunday Schools was transferred over to the new station in 1879, and Blackrock lifeboat station was closed.\nAlmost straight away, the decision was reversed, and in 1880, it was decided to reopen the Blackrock station, but also to retain the new Giles Quay station. A new boat, James Thomas, was placed at Giles Quay, and Stockport Sunday Schools was transferred back to Blackrock, but not before a race was held between the two station boats, Blackrock emerging victors after a restart.\nA new boat was placed at the station in 1885. General R. Dudley Blake (ON 95) was a 34-foot 6in Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat. As is the way, the lifeboat was not required for 10 years, and then she was required for two rescues on the same day, 24 December 1895. The first, to the steamship Paragon, beached at Dunaney Point, required 3 hours of hard rowing to make the 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) to the beached vessel, rescuing 11. The second, to the barque Ardendee of Liverpool, where another 11 people were rescued. It would then be another nine years before the lifeboat was once again needed.\nIn 1909, the lifeboat was replaced with a 35-foot lifeboat, given the same name, General R. Dudley Blake (ON 593). On a call just before Christmas 1909, both lifeboats from Blackrock and Giles Quay stood by, until a tug came to tow the steam dredger Thames to harbour.\nWith more powered vessels at sea, there were fewer and fewer calls on the lifeboat, and Blackrock would not be required again until 1923. In the last call out on 8 April 1923, the lifeboat brought ashore two passengers from the Fetlar, aground on the sand, but in no immediate danger.\nBlackrock lifeboat was called just 5 times between 1909 and 1935. With a motor-powered lifeboat placed at Clogherhead in 1931, Blackrock lifeboat station was closed in 1935. Launched 39 times since opening, the Blackrock lifeboat had rescued 75 people.\nGeneral R. Dudley Blake (ON 593) was sold from service, and as of 2023, was awaiting restoration at Ardee, Co.Louth.

It is on the edge of the Vienna Woods (German: Wienerwald). It stands opposite south of Liechtenstein Castle, the ancestral seat of and place of origin of the House of Liechtenstein, the ruling family of the Principality of Liechtenstein. Prince Johann I of Liechtenstein (1760\u20131836) built the neoclassical palace in Biedermeier style at the start of the 19th century as one of the princely summer residences. In the aftermath of World War II, the palace fall into ruins and has been sold by the princely family.\nToday, the palace (exterior) has been reconstructed and serves as a retirement centre.\nHistory\nView of Liechtenstein castle with opposite the manor house and the city of Vienna in the back by Georg Matth\u00e4us Vischer (1672)\nPrince Johann I of Liechtenstein (1816)\nLiechtenstein castle with the baroque-style Liechtenstein palace in 1801 by Franz Xaver St\u00f6ckl\nSchloss Liechtenstein, Liechtenstein castle and the surrounding landscape park with the amphitheatre in the early 19th century by Ferdinand Runk (Princely Liechtenstein Collections)\nPrince Johann II of Liechtenstein (1928)\nSchloss Liechtenstein around 1830 by Tranquillo Mollo\nAerial view of Schloss Liechtenstein and Liechtenstein castle around 1930\nAerial view of Schloss Liechtenstein\nLiechtenstein castle was constructed in the 12th century. Initially, it was owned by the Liechtenstein family. But over time, it transferred into the hands of other noble families. At the end of the 16th century, the estate administrator, Georg Wiesing, erected a manor house at the foot of the Kalenderberg opposite Liechtenstein castle, as the castle itself was probably no longer habitable at that time.\nDuring the Battle of Vienna in 1683, troops of the Ottoman Empire destroyed the castle and the manor house, leaving both in ruins. Rebuilding of the manor house started in 1686. In the 18th century, the manor house had become a small baroque-style palace. Ownership continued to transfer from one family to another noble family. Among these owners was the Polish prince Stanis\u0142aw Poniatowski (1754\u20131833), a nephew of king Stanislaus Augustus of Poland (r.\u20091764\u20131795).\nConstruction of a neoclassical palace\nBetween 1807 and 1808, out of romantic enthusiasm prince Johann I of Liechtenstein bought back from prince Poniatowski the ruins of his ancestral castle and the surrounding estate. He decided to replace the baroque manor house by a new summer palace. He commissioned the architect Joseph Engel, a student of Joseph Kornh\u00e4usel, to make a design in Biedermeier style. The palace was constructed between 1820 and 1822. The fa\u00e7ade was modeled after Weilburg Palace in Baden, the summer seat of the Teschen branch of the Habsburg family. The palace facade also has similarities with the Liechtenstein palace of Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky u Litovle (German: Neuschloss bei Littau) in Mlade\u010d, a baroque hunting lodge neoclassically reconstructed after a fire by prince Johann I between 1806 and 1808 basis a design of the architect Joseph Hardtmuth (1758-1816).\nAt the same time, an English landscape garden was laid out around the castle and the palace. It was decorated with Follies such as artificial ruins and temples. Also, the first restoration measures of Liechtenstein castle were carried out by the Joseph Hardtmuth between 1808 and 1816. However, the castle remained in ruins until 1884, when it was rebuilt by architect Carl Gangolf Kayser for prince Johann II of Liechtenstein (1840\u20131929).\nIn addition, there was focus on the agricultural development of the estate as well by building a dairy and a tree nursery. \nUntil he passed away in 1836, prince Johann I was very interested in Schloss Liechtenstein and paid much attention to the palace and the gardens.  He usually visited the palace in May. The entire princely family would often gather there as well. From the palace, the prince would go for long rides on his mountain pony every day. In the afternoon, he would visit the nearby surroundings. Returning after sunset, he would spend the time until supper, and often afterwards, on the balcony, always accompanied by one of his sons. Guests usually visited twice a week. Members of the Habsburg imperial family would come by like empress Maria Ludovika (1787-1816), the third wife of emperor Francis I (1768-1835), or archdukes Archduke John of Austria (1782-1859) and Ferdinand d'Este (1781-1859) when they were in Vienna.

    "Oba of Benin (r. 1700\u20131712)\nEwuakpe (r.\u20091700\u20131712) was the twenty-sixth Oba of Benin. Originally known as Idova, he was enthroned following his father Akenuzama's abdication due to old age. His ascension was intended to circumvent a prophecy by Ewuare the Great that foretold governmental upheaval under an Oba named Idova. However, his early rule faced resistance, with key figures and the general populace of Benin distancing themselves from palace activities and ceasing to provide necessary support for its operations. This led Ewuakpe to depart from Benin City and reside in Ikoka, the village of his mother, where he experienced additional adversity and engaged in humble tasks. The root of this widespread disapproval was traced back to a violent act he ordered during his mother's funeral. In a time of hardship, Ewuakpe sought the chiefs' support through traditional music and entreaty. A significant shift occurred when Iden, his spouse, consented to a ritual sacrifice to the gods, which resulted in the restoration of Ewuakpe's authority. This act influenced the chiefs to reaffirm their loyalty, thereby reinstating Ewuakpe's leadership. Following this event, Ewuakpe initiated reforms and strengthened his hold on power, which had a lasting impact on the kingdom's governance.\nReign and challenges\nEwuakpe's period as the Oba of Benin commenced with resistance from the chiefs and citizens. Their absence from palace gatherings and refusal to provide essential services necessitated Ewuakpe's retreat to Ikoka, his mother's village. In Ikoka, he faced adversity and undertook basic tasks. This hostility was a consequence of his actions during his mother's funeral, which had led to significant loss of life and subsequent discontent. Facing hardship, Ewuakpe appealed to the chiefs for support with traditional music. A critical turn of events occurred when Iden, his wife, agreed to be sacrificed to the gods, an act that resulted in the restoration of Ewuakpe's rule. This event prompted the chiefs to renew their support, leading to the reinstatement of his leadership. Ewuakpe then initiated reforms to enhance the kingdom's stability and ensure the loyalty of his subjects. These efforts laid the foundation for the kingdom's subsequent stability and growth.\nRestoration and reforms\nDuring Ewuakpe's rule, he initiated several reforms. He commenced trade with the Dutch, which contributed to the kingdom's economy and supported the royal art guilds. The period also marked the beginning of hereditary titles for official positions, adjusting the balance of power between the Oba and the high chiefs. An altarpiece in Berlin depicts Ewuakpe's return from exile, reflecting the changes of that time. Additionally, there was a reorganisation of the military, with Ode appointed as Iyase, leading the army. Despite early disputes with the Iyase and other chiefs, agreements were made that strengthened the monarchy. These actions during Ewuakpe's reign contributed to the long-term stability and development of the Benin kingdom.\nLegacy and succession\nEwuakpe's rule as the Oba of Benin is noted for constitutional changes. He implemented a succession law that established the right of the firstborn son to succeed the throne, a practice that persists in the Benin constitution. After his death, his second son, Ozuere, defied this law, leading to a civil dispute. Despite support from Iyase Ode, Ozuere's attempt at rule was short-lived. He fled to Uhen (Ise) after seeking refuge with his maternal uncle, Ejima of Okeluhen, where he died shortly after. Akenzua I, Ewuakpe's eldest son, then ascended the throne, maintaining the royal lineage. During his reign, Ewuakpe faced and overcame various challenges, reinforcing his rule through strategic reforms. These reforms had a lasting impact on the political and social structure of the Benin kingdom, contributing to its continuity and stability. Ewuakpe's tenure is recognised for its influence on the governance of Benin.\n",
    "For other periodicals by the same name, see Lietuva (newspaper).\nLietuva (transl.\u2009Lithuania) was a Lithuanian-language newspaper published by Lithuanian Americans in Chicago from 1892 to 1920. It was a liberal weekly. Its primary owner was Antanas Ol\u0161auskas who was forced to sell the newspaper due to financial difficulties in 1917. The new owners turned the newspaper into a daily in 1918, but Lietuva was discontinued in May 1920.\nHistory\nEstablishment\nIn 1892, Polish newspapers Nowe \u017bycie and Reforma went bankrupt. Stasys Rako\u0161ius (also known as Stanley Rokos, Rokosz or Ragai\u0161is), owner of the printing press, decided to establish the first Lithuanian newspaper in Chicago Lietuva. At the time, there were three Lithuanian periodicals in the United States: Vienyb\u0117 lietuvnink\u0173, Saul\u0117, and Garsas, and all of them were published in Pennsylvania. The first 4-page issue was published on December 10, 1892. Rako\u0161ius had disagreements with newspaper's editor Jonas Girnius\u00a0 and quickly sold the printing press to Vincas \u017daliauskas. The feud between Rako\u0161ius and \u017daliauskas ended in \u017daliauskas' arrest. The newspaper was sold for the second time in six months, but continued to struggle financially.\nIn the end, Antanas Ol\u0161auskas and three other men agreed to take over Lietuva for US$350 (equivalent to $11,869 in 2023) in June 1893. At the time, the newspaper had only 400 subscribers. Despite difficult economic conditions (see: Panic of 1893), the newspaper gained popularity and the printing press relocated to more spacious premises in 1894. Ol\u0161auskas established a successful bank and other businesses and was able to buy out other owners of Lietuva remaining the sole shareholder of the printing press in 1901.\nGrowth and dissolution\nThe newspaper and the printing press continued to grow. In 1900, Lietuva participated in a collective exhibit of American periodicals at the Paris Exposition. In January 1906, Lietuva doubled from four pages to eight. In December 1907, the printing acquired a Linotype machine \u2013 the first among Lithuanian publishers in the United States. By 1917, the printing press had three Linotype machines and seven permanent employees. The press workers complained of long hours and low pay. In 1906, they were able to negotiate 49-hour work week (reduced from 55 hours) and weekly pay of $16.50.\nIn 1916, Ol\u0161auskas' bank experienced a bank run and Ol\u0161auskas was forced to sell his businesses, including Lietuva. The printing press was acquired by J. J. Ba\u010di\u016bnas\u00a0 and Jonas P. Pajauskas in 1916, followed by the newspaper in June 1917. They established the Lithuanian Publishing Co. which had capital of $20,000 (equivalent to $475,636 in 2023). The new owners turned the newspaper into a daily in 1918, but Lietuva was discontinued in May 1920.\nContent\nAntanas Ol\u0161auskas was primarily in charge of content starting with the 24th issue. Experienced journalist Juozas Adomaitis-\u0160ernas became chief editor of Lietuva in December 1895. In March 1912, Bronius Kazys Balutis effectively took over the newspaper and edited it until June 1919.\nThe newspaper became a liberal publication which advocated for unity among Lithuanian immigrants, campaigned for a Lithuanian representative in the U.S. Congress, promoted entrepreneurship and self-improvement, discussed relations between Poles and Lithuanians, debated political issues concerning Lithuania. Under Adomaitis-\u0160ernas, the newspaper printed works of Lithuanian literature and was even classified as a literary newspaper. Balutis disliked both major branches of the Lithuanian movement \u2013 the socialist and Catholic camps \u2013 and advocated for the \"middle road\", i.e. Lithuanian nationalism. As an editor, Balutis stayed away from party politics and instead valued fact checking, polite discussions, and arguments based on facts.\nDuring World War I, Lietuva shifted to cover the news of the war and political developments in Lithuania. It published a daily two-page supplement with news from the war and Lithuania that was also edited by Balutis. The war called for unity among the various political fractions, and Lietuva actively supported and promoted the efforts to create a unified political organization of Lithuanian Americans.\nOther publications\nIn addition to publishing Lietuva, the printing house also published Lithuanian books. In 1894\u20131917, it published a total of 131 books, of which 45 were original and others were translations. These included 28 books on fairytales, legends, novellas, 31 theater plays, 20 popular science works, 15 texts on history, ethnography, culture, and three dictionaries. Most important books included the Lithuanian\u2013English dictionary by Antanas Lalis\u00a0 (1903), history of Lithuanians in Chicago by Antanas Ol\u0161auskas (1900), work on the origins of Lithuanians (promoting the discredited theories that Lithuanians hailed from the Balkans or Anatolia) by Jonas \u0160li\u016bpas (1899), three-volumes of Lithuanian fairytales collected by Jonas Basanavi\u010dius (1903\u20131904), translation of dr",

    "South Korean tenor and musical theatre actor\nPhillip Jeong (Korean: \uc815\ud544\ub9bd; born August 9, 1989) is a South Korean tenor and musical theatre actor.\nEarly life and education\nPhillip Jeong attended Peniel Arts High School to pursue his goal of becoming a classical tenor. During his high school years he went to Italy to study abroad, completing courses at Accademia Arena and Accademia Di Roma under Claudio Di Segni. He then returned to Korea to study under Professor WoongGyun Lim at the Department of Vocal Music, School of Music at the Korea National University of Arts. \nFacing a lack of opportunities as a tenor in South Korea, Jeong moved to Italy, hoping for better prospects. However, he encountered limited chances to perform or participate in competitions and eventually returned to South Korea. Subsequently, he became a non-regular member of the Busan Metropolitan Chorus.\nPhantom Singer\nIn 2017, Jeong took part in the JTBC audition program Phantom Singer 2, which aimed to form a male crossover quartet. He made it to the finals with the crossover team Miraclass\u00a0, consisting of Julian Jootaek Kim, Kang-hyun Park\u00a0, and Tae-in Han\u00a0, and finished as the runner-up.\nKey performances in Phantom Singer 2\nJeong's first audition song for season 2 of Phantom Singer was \"Mattinata.\"  His duo performance of \"Parla pi\u00f9 piano (Love Theme from The Godfather)\" received harsh criticism, while his trio mission performance of \"Look Inside\" (a song by Mark Vincent) received praise for his captivating voice. The quartet he belonged to in the semi-final round achieved the highest score with their performance of \"La Vita.\" In the final rounds, the judges formed three quartet teams: Forestella, Miraclass\u00a0, and Edel Reinklang.\nDevelopment and praise\nEarly in the competition, Jeong was critiqued for his rigid sense of rhythm. However, as the competition progressed, he developed a more flexible phrasing and rhythm. His voice earned him praise from judge Yoon Sang, who not only complimented his growth but also stated that Jeong had become one of his favorite voices.\nMiraclass\nThe crossover group Miraclass consists of Julian Jootaek Kim, Phillip Jeong, Kang-hyun Park, and Tae-in Han. Before the final rounds of Phantom Singer 2, they had to come up with a team name within a time constraint. Jeong coined the name \"Miraclass\" by combining \"miracle\" and \"class\". After the conclusion of Phantom Singer, Miraclass secured a fan base and has been actively performing in concerts related to Phantom Singer as well as holding their own team concerts. They also appear on broadcasts and release albums.\nDuring the period when offline concerts were halted due to COVID-19, the JTBC program Phantom Singer All Stars was aired in 2021. Miraclass excelled in this show, securing numerous wins, including one MVP award, in the competitions among the nine participating groups. In the program, Jeong performed not only with the Miraclass members but also with Se-kwon Ahn, Dong Hyun Kim, Hyung Ho Kang (PITTA), Bae Doo Hoon, and Minseok Kim.\nFeel in\nFeel in is a duo formed by Phillip Jeong and Tae-in Han in 2019, promoting easy listening music. The duo, consisting of a tenor and a bass vocalist, performs a variety of songs across different genres, including Korean pop songs, old pop, chansons, jazz, canzone, musical numbers, and country music.\nPerformances\nTheir first performance was an in-flight concert on an Asiana Airlines' inaugural flight from Incheon to Venice. They have concerts, appeared on TV and radios in Korea, and twice in Hong Kong and are scheduled to have their third performance in Hong Kong in September 2024.\nStage musicals and opera collage\n\"The Taming of Casanova,\" an opera collage featuring famous arias from various operas, was created to modernize opera and attract a larger audience in Korea. Jeong participated in this project to draw more people to the classical music genre. In Korea, where opera staging is limited due to a lack of public interest, only 56 performances were held in 2023. Additionally, Jeong made his debut as a musical actor in \"Jack the Ripper: The Musical,\" playing the role of Detective Anderson.\nConcerts\nJeong began participating in concerts as a performer or guest, starting with the outdoor concert of the Changwon City Dance Company at the 2015 Midsummer Night's Outdoor Concert. In 2015, he also collaborated in the solo recital of French soprano Isabelle Vernet\u00a0. After appearing in Phantom Singer 2 in 2017 and finishing as the runner-up with the Miraclass team, he started his active career as a classical and crossover vocalist, both as part of the crossover group and individually.\nKorea, with its highly concentrated metropolitan areas and declining populations in other regions, introduced the '\ubc29\ubc29\uace1\uace1 \ubb38\ud654\uacf5\uac10,' which translated to 'Cultural Empathy in Every Corner of Korea,' through the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korean Culture and Arts Centers Association to promote cultural empathy.

    "Criminal prosecution concerning the Trump fake electors scheme\nState of Wisconsin v. Kenneth Chesebro, et al. is a state criminal prosecution concerning the Trump fake electors plot in Wisconsin.  The three defendants, Kenneth J. Chesebro, Michael A. Roman, and James R. Troupis, were lawyers and political aides to Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign involved in planning and producing fraudulent electoral vote paperwork as part of a plot to replace or nullify the official electoral votes of the state of Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election.  The three defendants are each charged with a single count of conspiracy to utter forged official documents as legitimate.\nBackground\nMain articles: Trump fake electors plot and Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election\nJoe Biden won the 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin, carrying the state by 20,682 votes.  His slate of electors in Wisconsin was therefore the official electoral college slate for Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election, entitled to cast their ten votes for president on December\u00a014, 2020, and have those votes conveyed to and counted by the United\u00a0States\u00a0Congress on January\u00a06, 2021.  \nThe incumbent president, Donald Trump, lost the election in Wisconsin and nationally, in both the popular vote and electoral college vote.  In the days immediately after the presidential election, in November 2020, employees and allies of the Trump campaign sought to challenge the results of the election through various lawsuits.  In the midst of that litigation, Kenneth Chesebro, a Trump campaign lawyer, suggested that the campaign should target the January\u00a06, 2021, counting of electoral votes. For that purpose, he suggested that Trump's Wisconsin electoral slate\u2014which had not been elected by the voters of Wisconsin\u2014should meet anyway on the prescribed date\u2014December\u00a014, 2020\u2014and should cast their votes as though they were the state's official electors, fill out paperwork to that effect, and transmit it to Washington.  He conveyed this plan to Jim Troupis, a top legal advisor for Trump's campaign in Wisconsin, and after sharing their plans with other leaders of the Trump campaign, including Mike Roman, they proceed with the plan in Wisconsin and provided a template for similar operations in other states.\nInitially, this plan was described as a safeguard to preserve the possibility of sending the votes of Trump's electoral slate as the official electoral votes if the Trump campaign prevailed in one of their legal challenges in state or federal court, but the plot continued even as those legal challenges failed.  On November 30, the Wisconsin Elections Commission completed a certification of votes following a recount requested by Trump's campaign.  That same day, governor Tony Evers signed a certificate of ascertainment, certifying that the Biden electoral slate had received the most votes and were therefore Wisconsin's official slate of presidential electors for 2020.  Trump filed additional lawsuits challenging this certification, but those lawsuits were dismissed by United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin (on December\u00a011) and the Wisconsin Supreme Court (on the morning of December\u00a014).\nAt noon on December 14, 2020, Wisconsin's ten legitimate presidential electors met at the Wisconsin State Capitol, cast their votes for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and signed paperwork conveying their votes to the United States Congress and the National Archives and Records Administration.  At the same time, in another part of the Capitol, nine of the ten Trump electors met, elected a tenth elector to fill the vacancy of the missing tenth elector, then signed paperwork provided by Chesebro attesting that they were the \"duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America from the State of Wisconsin\", and asserting their ten votes should be counted for Donald Trump and Mike Pence.\nThe fraudulent paperwork was passed to U.S. senator Ron Johnson and his chief of staff.  They then attempted to convey the paperwork to Vice President Mike Pence before the certification of electoral votes on January\u00a06, 2021, but Pence staff refused the documents.  Following the riot which disrupted the counting of electoral votes on January\u00a06, the fraudulent elector scheme was brought to light by journalists and the January\u00a06 committee investigation.\nOther litigation\nFollowing investigations, the fraudulent elector scheme resulted in criminal charges in four other states.  Chesebro was subpoenaed by a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia, in July 2022.  In August 2023, he was one of eighteen people indicted for his role in the alleged racketeering conspiracy by Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis.  Chesebro reached a plea agreement with Fulton County prosecutors on October\u00a020, 2023, pleading guilty to a single felony count of conspiracy to file false documents, and received five years prob",
    "1959 studio album by Mark Murphy\nMark Murphy's Hip Parade is a studio album by Mark Murphy.\nMark Murphy's Hip Parade is the 4th album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy and his second for Capitol Records. It was recorded in 1959 when Murphy was 27 years old and released by the Capitol Records label in the United States in 1960. The album is a collection of pop tunes and standards performed with a jazz band.\nBackground\nCapitol Records producer Tom Morgan signed Murphy to a three-album contract when Murphy was on the West Coast in 1958 on the basis of the two albums he recorded for Milt Gabler of Decca Records. This release was his second album for Capitol.\nRecording\nThe arrangements for this release were done by Bill Holman. Holman had arranged his prior Capitol release. Gloria Wood and the Jud Conlon singers provide background vocals on several tracks.\nPianist Jimmy Rowles returns for his second appearance with Murphy. He was an in-demand accompanist for singers such as Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Jo Stafford, Anita O'Day, and Julie London. Rowles along with bassist Joe Mondragon and either drummer Mel Lewis or Stan Levy formed the rhythm section. The trumpeters Conte Candoli and his brother Pete Candoli returned as well.\nMany of the chosen tunes were hits for other singers. \"Come to Me\" was a hit for Johnny Mathis in 1958 and \"It's Not For Me to Say\" for Mathis in 1957, \"Venus\" for Frankie Avalon in 1959, \"Firefly\" for Tony Bennett in 1958, \"Personality\" for Lloyd Price in 1959, \"Send for Me\" for Nat Cole in 1957, and \"Witchcraft\" for Frank Sinatra in 1957. Years later Murphy told James Gavin that he and Holman, \"did songs from the hit parade and tried to make them hip\". \"I Only Have Eyes for You\" contains Murphy's first recorded scat solo\".\nReception\nColin Larkin assigns the record 3 stars in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music. Three stars means, \"Good. By the artist's usual standards and therefore recommended\". He wrote, \"the appearance of several albums in the late 50s announced that the jazz world had a new and important singer in its midst\".\nRalph J Gleason assigns 3 stars in DownBeat magazine. He wrote, \"Murphy is a pleasant, Sinatra-ish singer with a broad tone, a self-conscious manner, and a tendency to be overly mannered\". He praised the band, writing, \"Bill Holman has produced a crack musical accompaniment. The individual arrangements and the overall performance of the band is crisp. refreshing, and tasteful\". He called the album, \"a curious collection of tunes, mainly the better hits of recent years. and it's a commentary of sorts that only because of its rock 'n roll reprise would \"I Only Have Eyes for You\" be included\".\nMurphy biographer Peter Jones said, \"There are plenty of wince-inducing moments. The worst problem is over-production\".\nWill Friedwald said that the albums made during this period from 1956 to 1960 \"reveal a young singer with a strong, dark, attractive voice, with a lot of good ideas and an obvious commitment to the jazz idiom-but one who stops just short of having a sound and a style of his own\".\nThe attempt to capitalize on the previous success of the songs didn't work for Murphy and the album did poorly. Murphy said, \"I had tried to compromise, which of course was a mistake. People who wanted those songs didn't want to hear me, and people who liked me didn't want to hear those songs. They printed too many copies and it sank. We were kind of traumatized.\" \"I'm an alternative singer. In those days we didn't know what to call it\", Murphy told Gavin.\nTrack listing\n\"Firefly\" (Carolyn Leigh, Cy Coleman) \u2013 2:28\n\"Lonesome Town\" (Baker Knight) \u2013 2:26\n\"Kansas City\" (Mike Stoller, Jerry Leiber) \u2013 2:42\n\"Come to Me\" (Peter Lind Hayes, Robert Allen) \u2013 2:18\n\"Catch a Falling Star\" (Lee Pockriss, Paul Vance) \u2013 2:46\n\"All the Way\" (James Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn) \u2013 2:51\n\"Personality\" (Harold Logan, Lloyd Price ) \u2013 2:42\n\"Witchcraft\" (Leigh, Coleman) \u2013 3:35\n\"Venus\" (Ed Marshall) \u2013 3:02\n\"It's Not for Me to Say\" (Al Stillman, Robert Allen) \u2013 2:31\n\"Send for Me\" (Ollie Jones) \u2013 3:00\n\"I Only Have Eyes for You\" (Al Dubin, Harry Warren) \u2013 3:02\nPersonnel\nPerformance\nMark Murphy \u2013 vocals\nBill Holman \u2013 arranger, conductor, tenor saxophone (track 3), baritone saxophone (tracks 8, 11)\nJoe Mondragon \u2013 bass\nJimmy Rowles \u2013 piano (except 2)\nStan Levey \u2013 drums (tracks 3, 6, 10, 11)\nMel Lewis \u2013 drums (tracks 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12)\nLarry Bunker \u2013 vibraphone, percussion (tracks 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12)\nBob Gibbons \u2013 guitar (except 2)\nConte Candoli \u2013 trumpet (tracks 1, 3, 5 \u2013 12), percussion track 4\nPete Candoli \u2013 trumpet (tracks 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11), percussion track 4\nLee Katzman \u2013 trumpet (tracks 7, 9, 12)\nGloria Wood \u2013 background vocals (tracks 1, 2, 5, 7, 9)\nJud Conlon Singers \u2013 background vocals (tracks 1, 5, 7, 8, 9)\nProduction\nUnknown \u2013 engineer, recorded in Capitol Studios, Vine Street, Los Angeles August 24, 26, 28, 1959\nTom Morgan \u2013 producer\nPeggy Lee \u2013 liner notes\n",
    "\nInterCity Sleeper was the collective name for overnight sleeper train services run by British Rail between London and Scotland, Cornwall, Wales, and Northern England in Great Britain. Services were not provided in Northern Ireland.\nHistory\nWhen the railways came into public ownership in 1948, British railways inherited a number of night train services from the The Big Four. Sleeping car services were operated on the West, East coast routes and GWR mainlines to multiple destinations, that where, but not limited to London Paddington to Birkenhead Woodside, Manchester Piccadilly to Plymouth, Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston and Night Ferry sleeper from London Victoria to Brussels and Paris.\nThe first sleeping car train on the Great Western Railway was introduced at the end of 1877 from London Paddington to Plymouth. This had 7\u00a0ft (2,134\u00a0mm) broad gauge carriages with two dormitories, one with seven gentlemen's berths and the other with four ladies' berths. These were later replaced in 1881 by new carriages with six individual compartments. An additional service was soon added from London to Penzance which eventually became known as the Night Riviera. Under BR sleeping cars were limited to just the Penzance service After nationalisation there were two major investments in the sleeper fleet. The first occurred between 1957 and 1964 when 380 Mark 1 sleeping car carriages were built to replace the fleets inherited from the GWR, LMS and LNER. The Southern Railway didn't operate sleeper trains but did provide access to Compagnie International des Wagon Lits (CIWL) for their Night Ferry service from London to Paris via the Dover to Dunkerque train ferry. BR introduced the Inter-City brand for long haul passenger services in 1966. This in turn put all sleepers under the Inter-city banner.\nIn the early 1960s the list of sleeper trains operated by BR was still extensive, despite some minor changes and early withdrawal of services including the end of the Friday night sleeper service from London to Oban at 19:15, from London Euston, services to Birkenhead, Manchester to Plymouth from London. However, sleeper services declined in number during the latter half of the 20th century, with the closure of truck routes, and some larger terminus stations, these had disappeared by 1975. In 1971, British Rail had already withdrew the name Aberdonian from the early evening departure from King's Cross, then timed at 7:55\u00a0pm. The name Night Aberdonian was then used on the 10.15 King's Cross to Aberdeen sleeper service.\nIn 1977 operation of the Night Ferry sleeper train was taken over from CIWL by British Rail (Southern Region) under an agreement between BR, SNCF and SNCB. SNCF continued to be commercially responsible for the train as it had been since 1971 and bought the Wagon-Lits cars from CIWL. In January 1974 SNCF took over publicity of the Night Ferry sleeper service from CIWL. This ceased on the 31 October 1980 with the final departure of the Night Ferry sleeper from London, Paris and Brussels.\nBR Mk.I SLC No.W2452 (with B5 bogies) in BR Inter City blue & grey livery, built as Diagram 5, Lot 30736, by BR Wolverton in 1964 - one of the very last Mk.I sleepers built; at Old Oak Common shed Open Day, 07/67.\nOn 11 July 1983 the Penzance sleeper was relaunched as the Night Riviera, designed to complement the long-established daytime Cornish Riviera. The seating carriages that formed part of the train were mainly Mark 2 carriages. The train by now was again leaving London at midnight, shown in the timetables as 23:59.\nBR: InterCity Sleeper poster, (The Journey of a Nighttime), Image of a train at night, under a full moon with clouds. Printed 1988\nServices where further cutback, when in November 1987, it was announced that the last of the sleeper services running on the East Coast routes was to be withdrawn by May 1988. At one point, InterCity was planning to remove all seating accommodation on its remaining sleeper services from May 1992. However, it instead concluded a deal with the British transport conglomerate Stagecoach that saw the Mark 2 seating carriages retailed beyond this point. This was only a temporary reprieve however, as the Stagecoach carriages were withdrawn after 12 months. On Privatisation saw the services broken up in February 1996 and the rolling stock was repainted into the new liveries.\nRoutes\nBy 1975 the BR sleeper train services included the following:\nLondon Kings Cross to Leeds\nLondon Kings Cross to Newcastle\nLondon Kings Cross to Edinburgh, Fort William and Aberdeen.\nLondon Euston to Liverpool Lime Street\nLondon Euston to Manchester Piccadilly\nLondon Euston to Holyhead\nLondon Euston to Preston and Barrow\nLondon Euston to Carlisle and Stranraer Harbour\nLondon Euston to Glasgow and Inverness\nLondon Paddington to Milford Haven\nLondon Paddington to Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance\nLondon Victoria to Paris and Brussels (The Night Ferry)\nBristol Temple Meads to Glasgow Central and Edinburgh\nNottingham to Glas",

    "\n2011 studio album by H\u1ed3ng Nhung\nV\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n, or The Circle, is the eleventh studio album by Vietnamese female singer Hong Nhung, released by Viet Tan Studio on November 21, 2011. The album was written by Hong Nhung, and Quoc Trung wrote the musical script, along with some songs written by other musicians. The songs in the album express a musical message about the close connection between people and the outside world, between music and life.\nMusic\nQuoc Trung is the person who plays the main role in innovating Hong Nhung's style. \"V\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n\", the first song in the album and also the first single, is a song that according to Hong Nhung \"conveys content about the soul, about life with a profound philosophy\". Musician Vo Thien Thanh said that Hong Nhung was the one who proactively invited him to compose an electronic song for this project, and this is the reason \"V\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n\" was written.\nThe song's music video is said to have a \"transformation\" compared to Hong Nhung's image from previous studio albums, with the content \"suggesting a message such as a philosophy of life with the yin and yang circle, the reincarnation of creation, the strong, the weak, the good, the evil\". The purpose of this video is to help viewers realize \"happiness is living, and the meaning of life lies in the journey between good-evil, red-black, birth-death... like an endless cycle.\" The video was made in two days with more than 30 hours of work, and is part of a series of videos participating in the 2011 Vietnam Music Video Awards.\nThe two songs \"Ph\u1ed1\" and \"Saigon\" both carry the energy and vitality of the city and metropolis. \"Ngh\u1ecbch N\u1eafng\" and \"Tr\u1edf V\u1ec1\" refer to Hong Nhung's own nostalgia for Hanoi \u2013 a city where the singer was born.\nLive performance\nHong Nhung and Quoc Trung introduced V\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n project at the B\u00e0i h\u00e1t Vi\u1ec7t music series on November 13, 2011; Here, she performed live four songs \"Papa\", \"Ngh\u1ecbch N\u1eafng\", \"Saigon\" and the title track \"V\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n\". \"Papa\" was also performed by Hong Nhung as a duet with Vietnamese singer Vu Cat Tuong at the music concert Ph\u1ed1 \u00c0 Ph\u1ed1 \u01a0i... B\u1ed1ng \u00c0 B\u1ed1ng \u01a0i! on December 5, 2015, in Hanoi.\nReception\nSome viewers believe that Hong Nhung's image in the album is somewhat younger than her age, and that the fashion style or hairstyle she shows is only suitable for teenagers. The album was nominated for the 2011 Dedication Music Award for Album of the Year. The song \"V\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n\" also received the Favorite Song of August 2012 award.\nTrack listing\n",

    "Species of insect\nNepa anophthalma is a species of troglofaunal insect in the Nepidae family (water scorpions), and in the genus Nepa. It holds the distinction of being the only known cave-adapted water scorpion so far discovered. Like with most troglobites, this genus has a limited distribution range, with it only being found in Movile cave, a cave in Romania known for its unique ecosystem supported by chemosynthesis, and with little oxygen. It is often considered a top predator within the aquatic environments of this cave, with very little competition with other animals.\nDiscovery\nMovile cave was first discovered in 1986 by a team of workers looking for an appropriate spot to build a power plant. Less than a hundred or so have actually been allowed inside the cave due to the number of hazards inside (lack of a natural opening, high levels of carbon dioxide and sulfur, hydrogen sulfide, etc.). The cave also has very high humidity and temperatures, but also has very low levels of oxygen, with some of the deeper water levels in the cave being completely anoxic. Despite these daunting conditions, the cave boasts very high levels of biodiversity, with dozens of species having been discovered, with about 75% only living in this system. Nepa anophthalma was first described in 1994 based on eleven or so specimens, and at the time was one of twelve or so species known from the cave. The species name roughly translates to \"without eyes\", which is after this species lacking eyes due to its troglobitic ecology.\nEvolution\nThe fauna of Movile cave are notable due to being cut off from the rest of the world for about 5.5 million years, and thus are important for looking into the evolution of various groups. Despite this, not all of the fauna are that old, with some species appearing to be more recent additions to the caves ecosystem, with N. anophthalma being among these. It has been proposed that the ancestors of this water scorpion first arrived to Movile Cave sometime during the Pleistocene epoch, potentially through microfissures located in water filled sinkholes in the region that were cut off once large amounts of clay were deposited in the area towards the end of the Riss glaciation. This is not unheard of, as another denizen of Movile cave, Heleobia dobrogica, the caves sole gastropod, is thought to have inhabited the cave for slightly more than 2 million years.\nDescription\nMales of the species are known to reach around 17.0 to 19.1 millimeters in length, while the females are around 17.0 to 20.3 millimeters. Like with most other troglobites, this insect is entirely blind. However, this species still has intact optic nerves, and pigment. Known specimens are either brown-yellow brown in color, and the body is elongated, and flattened on the dorsal plane. Known specimens also possess bi-segmented antennae, usually around 0.8 to 1.0 millimeters long. This species also has brachyptery, a condition in animals that indicates short, or at very least reduced wings, which is not that surprising considering its entirely aquatic lifestyle. The hemelytral membranes are also reduced, a contrast to most other water scorpions.\nEcology\nHolotype specimen of Cryptops speleorex, a troglofaunal centipede, and is not only one of Movile Cave's largest terrestrial predators, but also the largest invertebrate from the cave.\nThis species is known only from the margins of a water body in Movile cave, as well as air pockets below the surface. This species therefore seems to only inhabit the upper depths of the lake, as no other animals have been found living below five centimeters. The water itself reaches a temperature of around 8 to 10 degrees Celsius, and contains not only sulfur, but also bacteria that have evolved to oxidize the sulfur. These microorganisms appear to form the base of Movile cave's food web, in the place of the sun, bat guano, and other sources. N. anophthalma shares the cave's waterways with a plethora of wildlife including \"ciliates, turbellarians, nematodes, oligochaetes, hirudineans, gastropods, ostracods, copepods, amphipods, and isopods\", however, there are also terrestrial troglobites including a centipede (Cryptops speleorex), Isopods, pseudoscorpions, and spiders. This water scorpion fills the role of top predator in the cave's waterways, alongside undescribed members of the Dendrocoelum and Haemopis genera.\n",
    "\nThis article is about Israeli war crimes during the Israel\u2013Hamas war. For war crimes committed by all parties during the war, see War crimes in the Israel\u2013Hamas war. For Israeli war crimes committed since 1948, see Israeli war crimes. For the case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice, see South Africa's genocide case against Israel.\nWorld Central Kitchen car after IDF strike\nSince the beginning of the Israel\u2013Hamas war in 2023, the Israeli military and authorities have been charged with committing war crimes, such as indiscriminate attacks on civilians in densely-populated areas (including strikes on hospitals and medical facilities, refugee camps, schools and educational institutions, and municipal services); genocide; forced evacuations; the torture and executions of civilians; sexual violence; destruction of cultural heritage; collective punishment; and the mistreatment and torture of Palestinian prisoners. Humanitarian organizations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, B'tselem, the UN Human Rights Council, and human rights groups and experts, including United Nations special rapporteurs, have documented these actions.\nIsrael has faced legal charges for its conduct in the war. At the International Court of Justice, Israel was charged with committing genocide in Gaza. In May 2024, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) stated that he was seeking arrest warrants against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including using starvation as a weapon of war.\nWhile Israel has faced international condemnation for its alleged war crimes, it has also maintained continued support from the United States. In October 2023, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken indicated the Biden administration had a \"high tolerance\" for whatever happens in Gaza, and the White House stated it had no red lines for Israeli actions. As the largest supplier of military support to Israel during the war, the United States has been accused of complicity in Israel's war crimes.\nProportionality and distinction\nPalestine Tower destroyed in Gaza, October 2023.\nIsrael's adherence to the principles of discrimination and proportionality as required by the laws of war has been questioned. Human Rights Watch has stated that the overall civilian death toll, and Israel's use of powerful weapons in Gaza's densely-populated neighbourhoods, raised \"serious questions\" about the legality of Israel's conduct. Human Rights Watch further argued that a higher proportion of casualties among women and children is indicative of a lack of proportionality, demonstrating what they describe as \"a disregard toward Palestinian lives\". Amnesty International accused Israel of war crimes in a report where it analyzed five incidents between 7 and 12 October where the IDF targeted residential areas in Gaza. It found that in several cases the IDF struck targets with no evidence of military activity and that these attacks were \"indiscriminate\" in nature. Anonymous IDF officials cited in a report by +972 Magazine indicated a \"loosening of constraints\" in the rules of engagement, and that in numerous cases the IDF struck targets despite no evidence of military activity. The report claims that the rationale behind such attacks was \"to harm Palestinian civil society\" and, according to one source cited by the report, to \"lead civilians to put pressure on Hamas\".\nExperts cited by The Washington Post argue that certain Israeli airstrikes show that Israel has a tolerance for civilian casualties \"orders of magnitude greater\" than that of the US in its war against ISIS. United Nations officials and human rights groups have argued that Israel has not done enough to protect civilians. In March 2024, the United Nations said that more children were killed in Gaza in four months than in four years of worldwide wars. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, declared: \"This war is a war on children\".\nThree men carry a dead woman to the Indonesia Hospital in Jabalia refugee camp, October 2023.\nEmanuela-Chiara Gillard, an associate fellow at Chatham House, argued that, given the size and nature of the 7 October attacks, Israel has a right of self-defence that could include its stated military aim of destroying Hamas, which has threatened to repeat its assault and eradicate the state of Israel. According to The Economist, the law of armed conflict (LOAC) and international humanitarian law (IHL) grant Israel flexibility when it comes to taking military action against Hamas, but in its view, Israel's \"definition of military targets is being stretched to breaking-point\".\nAmichai Cohen, an Israeli lawyer, alleges that Israel does not deliberately target civilians but that Hamas's tactics make it hard to take action without affecting civilians.

It is connected by wetlands to the Akanyaru River.\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification is Aw: Tropical savanna, wet.\nConservation\nLake Mwungere is in the Lacs du Nord Aquatic Landscape Protected Area, created in 2006, which in theory conserves more than 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of lakes and wetlands with the goal of integrated community management, agricultural production, and lake conservation.\nThe lake is part of the Northern Protected Waterway, a 162.42 square kilometres (62.71\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) complex of 8 permanent freshwater lakes including lakes Rweru, Cohoha, Rwihinda, Kanzigiri, Gacamirindi, Nagitamo, Narungazi and Mwungere as well as marshes, that form part of the Nile Basin.\nThese lakes are dominated by small Tilapia and Oreochromis species.\nThey have been the site of largescale invasions of water hyacinth, which has greatly decreased production and reduced fish stocks, as well as crowded out native vegetation. \nBurundi has taken little effort to remove the invasive species.\nThe Kagera Aquatic Zone's Management Plan aims to improve management of the lakes, marshlands and vegetation in the Murehe Forest area.\nLake Mwungere is considered an Integral Zone under this plan, which includes lakes Gacamirina and Nagitamo, and marshlands in the secondary valleys of the Akanyaru River. Human influence should be excluded from the zone by a 50 metres (160\u00a0ft) belt to protect the natural species.\nIn November 2021 Albert Hatungimana, Governor of Kirundo, praised the achievements of Inades-Formation Burundi in creating buffer zones for the Nagitamo, Mwungere and Gacamirinda lakes. \nThe protective belt includes trees, anti-erosion ditches with fixation grasses above them, and a canal separating the buffer zone from private properties.\nFish production and water quality has improved in the protected lakes as a result.\n",
    "1913 multi-fatality incident\nThe Long Beach pier auditorium disaster, sometimes known as the Empire Day tragedy, occurred on Saturday, May 24, 1913, in Long Beach, California, United States, when the top level of the Pine Avenue Pier collapsed near the entrance to the municipal auditorium. A 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) section holding by some 400 people dropped 25\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m) when a rotted girder snapped. The final death toll was 39, with some 150 injuries.\nThe pier was the second pier at that location. (The first Long Beach Municipal Pier was built in 1894.) The recreation wharf had been opened to the public in 1904. In 1905 the pier added an auditorium \"designed by renowned California architect Joseph Cather Newsom and featured an assembly space large enough to accommodate 5,000, multilevel outdoor promenades and two towers framing the central section of the building....a horrendous structural failure caused by wood rot\" killed and injured almost 200 people when the floor collapsed. The pier was especially crowded that day because of an Empire Day celebration of the Commonwealth on the anniversary of Queen Victoria's birthday, which had attracted tens of thousands of British expatriates from around Southern California. The California State Supreme Court later found the city of Long Beach \"negligent for the rotted wooden pier pilings\".\nAfter the upper deck collapsed in 1913, the city wanted to demolish the entire structure but residents lobbied for a restoration, and a reconstructed Pine Avenue Pier opened in 1915. The repaired Pine Avenue pier stood until 1934.\nGallery\nLong Beach pier auditorium disaster\nLithographic postcard postmarked January 18, 1913, showing the auditorium on the beach end of the pier\nThe building in front of the pier is Pacific Electric's Long Beach station, southern terminus of the Long Beach Line\nVerso of real photo postcard of the collapsed deck\u2014\"they fell 40 feet through another floor to the sand\"\nLos Angeles Evening Record front page\nLos Angeles Times front page\n",

    "\nThe 2024 dengue epidemic in Argentina is an outbreak of this disease, transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. It is considered to date as the largest dengue outbreak in Argentine history.\nEpidemic outbreaks have been attributed to climate change and the mobility of people between neighbouring countries. From epidemiological week 1 to 13 of 2024, 215,885 cases have been reported, with a fatality rate of 0.07%. Although the tetravalent vaccine TAK-003 has been approved, its accessibility is limited by its high cost. The shortage of medical supplies and diagnostic reagents has caused a crisis in some health centres, while public policies, particularly in relation to the non-inclusion of the vaccine in the mandatory schedule and lack of allocation of funds for awareness campaigns, have generated controversy. On May 9, 2024, the Argentine Government announced that it will offer the dengue vaccine, but only limited to endemic areas with the highest prevalence of cases.\nDengue has spread more in the provinces of northern Argentina than in southern Argentina. This is due to Patagonia having a colder climate than northern regions.\nBy April 2024, the cases across the Americas was over 5\u00a0million people. By 10 June 2024, Argentina had reported over 500,000 cases.\nBackground\nThe current season is distinguished by being the most significant in terms of exponential magnitude. In addition, it stands out for the persistence of cases in every week so far. The peak was reached in epidemiological week 11 of 2024, with a historical record of 33,866 cases, marking the maximum number of cases reported in a single week to date.\nCauses\nThe process of climate change has produced abundant rains and high temperatures, (a phenomenon called tropicalization) favouring the reproduction of the mosquito that transmits the dengue virus, advancing the epidemic this year by several weeks compared to previous seasons, which historically, Infection peaks tended to occur between March and April, suggesting a continued increase in cases. Precipitation provides more places for females to lay their eggs, while elevated temperatures allow mosquitoes to complete their maturation cycle and disperse the virus. Shortages of insect repellent have been reported.\nDr. Ricardo Gurtler, researcher at the Institute of Ecology, Genetics and Evolution of Buenos Aires, argues that the increase in dengue cases in Argentina is not only due to the situation in Brazil, where the incidence of the disease is high and has occurred a movement of the virus to other regions, but also to the intense exchange that Argentina has with neighbouring countries such as Paraguay and Bolivia. These countries have experienced epidemic outbreaks of dengue during the year, which could have contributed to the increase in cases in Argentina due to the mobility of people and the spread of the virus across borders.\nIt is also important to note that some areas of the country experienced a significant increase in precipitation due to the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. This contributed to excess water stagnation compared to normal levels. In addition, mosquitoes have developed resistance to lower temperatures, extending to latitudes further south than usual.\nIn a complementary sense, the absence of a visible and massive prevention campaign by public communication (directly related to the decision of the national government not to invest in dissemination) negatively affected, thus not allowing the population to be alerted to carry out actions that mitigate and combat the development of this epidemic.\nFurthermore, the Argentine Government did not implement the vaccine on schedule. This situation was aggravated by the lack of price control after the dismantling of regulatory areas by the new government of Javier Milei.\nEpidemiology\nEpidemiological context\nThe dengue outbreak, as well as other arboviruses, is analysed by the Ministry of Health in the context of the \"epidemiological season\", which in this case is in the period 2023/2024, which covers from epidemiological week 31 of the year 2023. until epidemiological week 30 of the year 2024, in which a total of 232,996 cases of dengue have been registered in Argentina. Of these, 215,885 cases have been specifically recorded from the beginning of the year 2024 to epidemiological week 13. Of these cases, 90% are considered indigenous, 7% are in the investigation phase and 3% are imported. Unofficial data indicate an approximate figure of 1,000,000 cases.\nAs for the accumulated incidence so far throughout the country, it stands at 495 cases per one hundred thousand people.\nDuring this period, 512 cases have been classified as severe dengue, representing 0.2% of total cases. In addition, 161 dengue-related deaths have been recorded, which represents a fatality rate of 0.069%.\nIt is important to highlight that a persistence of cases is observed throughout the entire period analysed, as well as an advance in the seasonal increase starting from epidemiological",
    "Ronald Fraser Scott (April 9, 1929 \u2013 August 16, 2005) was a British-born, American geotechnical engineer. An internationally recognized authority on the mechanics of soils, his lunar soil experiments on the Surveyor missions cleared the Apollo astronauts to walk safely on the moon.\nEarly life and education\nScott was born in London on April 9, 1929, but grew up in Perth, Scotland. He earned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Glasgow in 1951, a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1953 and a doctorate from M.I.T. in 1955. His interest in soil behavior \u2013 possibly sparked by boyhood experience digging potatoes during World War II when the men were away at service \u2013 developed into a scientific understanding of soils as complicated two-phase media of solid particles and fluids. After graduation, he worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructing pavements on permafrost in Greenland. He joined the engineering faculty at the California Institute of Technology as an assistant professor in 1958.\nAcademic career\nLunar soil\nIn the 1960s, Scott was tapped to answer the question of whether or not the Apollo astronauts would sink into the ground during landing. Almost nothing was known about lunar soil at the time. Some believed it was composed of fine powder like talc that would not support the weight of a human. Others thought it was granular and firm like sand. To find out, Scott and Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineer Floyd Roberson developed a soil sampler that resembled a small, square backhoe shovel. The scoop would be mounted on an articulated, extensible trellis that could dig trenches, scrape up soil, lift large clods and drop them to break up the lumps. It could also measure the soil's resistant force and weight to determine properties of bearing strength, cohesion and density. Scott's proposal was accepted by NASA, and he was named a principal investigator on the Surveyor 3 and Surveyor 7 missions.\nThe sampler's first use was on Surveyor 3 in 1967. \u201cFor the next two weeks,\u201d Scott wrote, \u201cFloyd and I happily and sleeplessly played with the lunar surface soil on the inside surface of a 650-foot-diameter crater.\u201d From those tests, he concluded that the lunar soil at the site was fine-grained with small cohesion and an internal friction angle of 35 degrees \u2013 similar to the properties of terrestrial sand - with a bearing strength of about 10 pounds per square inch (0.7 kilograms per square centimeter, or 98 kilopascals). The lunar soil was declared safe enough to walk on and solid enough to support the Apollo Lunar Module.\nWhen Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon's surface on July 20, 1969, he famously declared, \u201cThat\u2019s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d Less remembered, the next words in his transmission confirmed Scott's prediction: \u201cI sink in about an eighth of an inch. I\u2019ve left a print on the surface.\u201d\nIn November 1969, Apollo 12's lunar module landed close enough to Surveyor 3 that astronauts Charles Conrad and Alan Bean walked over to it. Conrad cut off the scoop and brought it back to Earth in two Teflon bags. Scott, who was present when the bags were opened, said, \u201cIf I had known I would see it again, I would have left the scoop completely packed with lunar soil.\u201d\nMartian soil\nThe two Viking spacecraft that landed on Mars in 1976 also needed soil samples, and again, Scott worked on those robotic collectors. Some of the soil collected by the Martian scoops was used in a life-detection experiment designed by Caltech biologist Norman Horowitz.\nTerrestrial Soil\nScott was deeply interested in soil and foundation stability, important in landslides and dam failures. He was a consultant in the investigation of the Baldwin Hills Dam failure in 1963 and again in the 1978 Bluebird Canyon landslide in Laguna Beach, California. He studied the behavior of retaining walls and footing foundations during earthquakes. Scott's work also included design of underwater foundations of wastewater outfalls, offshore drilling structures and support anchors for guyed offshore towers.\nIn the 1970s, Scott advocated the use of centrifuges to study soil properties and behavior under conditions of high static and dynamic pressure. He argued that soil mechanical properties are highly dependent on overburden pressures that can't be reproduced in the laboratory with mechanical or hydraulic presses. Deeply buried soil is under higher pressure and, therefore, has a higher failure pressure level than surface soil. To reproduce the soil pressure at the bottom of a large earthen dam with a 1/100 scale model would require an effective gravity 100 times that of the earth. Scott showed that he could achieve those acceleration levels by spinning the model in a centrifuge. Moreover, his centrifuge could incorporate seismic motion using a computer-controlled shaking table, enabling him to model the response of a dam to a large earthquake.\nScott was elected to the Na",

    "Greek football club\nFootball club\nAnagennisi Giannitsa are a Greek football club, based in Giannitsa. They compete in the A1 Division of Pella at the municipal seat stadium in the city of Giannitsa. In their 62-year history, the team has never played in the Super League Greece. The team's colors are blue and white.\nHistory\nAnagennisi Giannitsa were officially founded in 1961 with the full name \"Gymnastics Athletic Association Anagennisi Giannitsa\". Their foundation was the result of the love of the football-loving world of Giannitsa, who wanted a strong team, present in football events. In the past there were in the area the clubs \"Apollo Giannitsa\" founded in 1928, \"Renaissance Giannitsa\" founded in 1939 and short-lived. In 1948, \"Apollon Giannitsson\" were founded again, with the then mayor of the city, Kostas Stamkos, as president.\nIn the years 1950 and 1951, there was a lot of football activity in the local community, with the establishment of four clubs that were the forerunners of the current group. These were Megas Alexandros Giannitsa, Iraklis Giannitsa, AOK Giannitssa (Sports Club of Kariotes) and the Pontiac Youth. In 1955, a process of merging the local teams began, resulting in the emergence of two dominant clubs by 1960, Macedonikos Giannitssa and Pontian Youth. Finally, in 1961, Macedonikos Giannitsson and Pontiac Youth merged, resulting in the creation of Anagennisi Giannirsa.\nThe rationale behind the establishment of the club was for the club of Anagennisi to function as a mixture of the city and the wider province. And that's the point. The team do not operate in competition with the other teams, but as a promotion station for the players of the town.\nThe course of Anagennisi\nThey started playing in the league of Local Central Macedonia and made their first appearance in the second national division in the 1964\u201365 season, winning the 1st place in the 4th group, which is the highest ranking in their history so far. They did not manage to get the promotion to the first national division, as in the final phase they finished in the third place among the winning teams of each group.\nIn 1974, after 10 years of presence in the second division, Anagennisi were relegated to the local leagues, to return to the second division in 1978, where they remained until 1983, when they experienced relegation again, despite the fact that two years earlier (1981) they had finished second. They competed for 4 years in the third division, but their decline continued, as in 1988 and 1989 they were in the fourth division. In the 1988\u201389 season, Anagennisi won their first domestic title, the Greek Amateur Cup.\nIn 1989-90 they returned to the third national division, won the championship in the Northern group under coach Georgios Foiros, to follow another four years of presence in the second division, until 1993\u201394, when they were relegated to the third division. From 1997, a new downward trend followed as for the following decade the team found itself moving between the 4th national and local championships of EPS Pella.\nThey returned to the third division in 2007, where they finished 8th in the standings. In 2011-12 and 2012-13 they competed again in the second division (Football League), where they had an admirable course. Anagennisi Giannitsa came 2nd in the second division twice, in the 1964\u201365 season and in the 1980\u201381 season. The team has emerged as the champion of the third division once and the fourth division twice, while they won the Greek amateur cup in the 1989\u201390 season with Foiros as coach and Iosifidis as their president.\nAnagennisi are in the top 30 teams in points collection in the second division and also in the first 30 teams in the third division, despite being away from these division for years.\nIn the institution of the Greek Cup, Anagennisi Giannitsa do not have to demonstrate any particular success, as they has never progressed at least to the quarter-final phase of any competition.\nIn April 2022, after a very bad run, the team were relegated to the local A1 division of Pella. Characteristic of the very bad course of the team, were the only 7 points they collected in the 2nd round of the championship, with a total collection of 22 points.\nMerger with A.S. Giannitsa\nIn July 2019, and while the risk of dissolution was visible, as the historical Anagennisi Giannitsa had been relegated to the second division of the local league (A' Division EPS Pellas), they merged with A.S. Giannitsa, who competed in the championship of the third national division, creating the \"Anagennisi Giannitsa Sports Club\". From the 2019\u201320 season, Anagennisi Giannitsa returned to the national championships, participating in the third national division.\nFrom September 2021, the team again started using the name \"A.S. Giannitsa\". The team was based on young talented kids from the their hometown and the surrounding area,. Indicative of this effort is that in a cup match they beat Edessaikos, in the local derby of Pella, with 5\u2013",

The football team initially participated in the Leipzig city league and over the following years rose up to the Saxony State League, which was the third-highest league in East German football until 1952. After the introduction of the East German district system instead of the former East German states, SG Markkleeberg was integrated into the Leipzig District League.\nUntil 1955, the Sportgemeinschaft was an exception in the East German sports structure, which was usually organized in factory sports clubs (BSG). It was not until February 1955 that the SG was transformed into the BSG Medizin Markkleeberg. Despite the new parent company, the football team had to relegate to the fifth-tier Leipzig District Class at the end of the 1955 season.\nBSG Aktivist / TSG Chemie\nTSG Chemie logo\nFour years later, on June 30, 1959, the BSG Aktivist Markkleeberg was founded with the economically strong coal processing plant B\u00f6hlen as the parent company. In 1968, the circle of parent companies was expanded and the BSG was transformed into the TSG Chemie Markkleeberg. After many years in the Leipzig-Land District League, the club achieved promotion to the Leipzig District Class in 1971, which had since been upgraded to the 4th league tier after restructurings in East German football. Here, the TSG encountered their local rival BSG Medizin, with whom they played together in the District Class until 1977. Afterwards, their ways parted. While BSG Medizin relegated to the District Class, the TSG Chemie had managed to gain promotion to the third-tier Leipzig District League. In the District League, the TSG Chemie quickly developed into a top team. After previously three second-place finishes, the team won the district championship in 1982 and thus qualified for the second-tier East German DDR-Liga. There, it became a collection point for former DDR-Oberliga players, so that Chemie Markkleeberg was able to secure their league status until the end of East German football operations. In 1986, the TSG had dropped the \"Chemie\" addition, as the structure of the parent companies had changed again in the meantime. In the 1983/84 season, the TSG achieved its best league position with a 5th place in the league group C. Coach Karl B\u00fchler could rely on the following regular lineup:\nJoachim Niklasch (22 games, 30 years)\nUwe Neumann (15/25)\nGunter Sekora (22/33),\nFrank Matychowiak (22/30)\nFrank Mulanski (22/30)\nHolger Wacker (18/23)\nJoachim Kirste (17/31)\nWolfgang Lischke (21/36)\nPeter Englisch (8/21)\nWilfried Erler (19/37)\nRainer Srodecki (20/27)\nThe team had an astonishingly high average age of 29.4 years, but seven players played in 90 percent of all matches. In TSG's most successful year, an average of 1,700 visitors came to the 6,000-seat sports field on the Lauer. This had to make way for open-cast lignite mining in 1989 and was located roughly where the north shore of Lake Cospuden is today.\nLeague statistics 1968\u20131990\n1968\u20131971:\tDistrict class Leipzig-Land\n1971\u20131977:\tDistrict class Leipzig\n1977\u20131982:\tDistrict League Leipzig\n1982\u20131990:\tDDR League\nPost-reunification period\nMain article: 1.

The members of the football section of the former TSG Markkleeberg then founded 1. FC Markkleeberg on June 30, 1990. Due to its previous membership in the GDR league, the FC was integrated into the renamed league of the Northeast German Football Association, which had second-class status for one season in the reunified Federal Republic. In 1991, the club, as a member of the NOFV league that had not been promoted to the 2nd Bundesliga, was integrated into the newly founded third-class Oberliga Nordost, just like the members of the previously first-class NOFV Oberliga . The Markkleebergers played there until the 1993/94 season. For one season (1991/92) Frank Rost, later a Bundesliga professional (Werder Bremen, FC Schalke 04, Hamburger SV) and four-time national player, was in goal for 1. FC. Within three years, the club had accumulated debts of 700,000 DM and, because the city did not want to take on the liabilities, had to file for bankruptcy in the spring of 1994. With the deletion from the club register, 1. FC Markkleeberg ceased to exist.\nKickers 94 Markkleeberg e. V.\nAfter the demise of 1. FC, the first men's team disbanded comple",
    "Earthquake in Japan\nThe 1909 Anegawa earthquake affected Shiga and Gifu prefectures in Japan on August 14. The epicenter of the Mw 6.9 earthquake was located in Gifu Prefecture and its focal depth was estimated at 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi). There were at least 41 fatalities and over 1,000 homes destroyed. A 1.8\u00a0m (5.9\u00a0ft) high tsunami was also recorded in Lake Biwa.\nEarthquake\nThe earthquake may have occurred on the Tsurugawan-Isewan Tectonic Line, a major fault trending generally northwest\u2013southeast in central Japan. The fault zone comprises five active fault segments that trend northwest\u2013southeast and west-northwest\u2013east-southeast. Its northern strand, the Kaburagi Fault, runs along the edge of Tsuruga Bay and joins the Yanagase Fault to its south. A bend towards the east\u2013southeast separates the fault from the Sekigahara Fault. The earthquake likely ruptured the central portion of the Sekigahara Fault. A possible precursor event sequence may have began ten years before the mainshock as \"notable earthquakes\" occurred along an area between Tsuruga Bay and Ise Bay. The damage area from the earthquake was considered smaller than expected for its magnitude. The fault zone also contains two additional segments; the Yoro and Isewan faults; the latter is considered a branch of the Japan Median Tectonic Line. The Sekigahara Fault produces reverse and left-lateral strike-slip movement.\nImpact\nForty-one people died and at least 784 were injured. In addition to 1,100 destroyed houses, many temples were razed. An additional 1,000 homes were also damaged. The slope of Mount Ibuki collapsed which was accompanied by a \"thunderous roar.\" Fifty homes on Lake Biwa were totally razed and 20 others were destroyed. A toppling cliffside at a Gifu marble quarry left one dead and five wounded. Thirty people died in Higashiazai District; the worst affected district. Fifteen worship monuments and places were also totally ruined. At least 431 homes and 636 buildings completely collapsed. The maximum JMA seismic intensity (Shindo) was 6 in present-day Nagahama. Shindo 4\u20135 was also observed throughout Shiga Prefecture.\nSee also\nList of earthquakes in 1909\nList of earthquakes in Japan\n",
    "Italian architect (1850\u20141911)\nLuigi Rovelli (1850\u20131911) was an Italian architect, a key figure in the eclecticism movement in Liguria.\nBiography\nThe facade of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Montallegro in Rapallo, designed by Rovelli in 1896.\nThe building at 34 Via XX Settembre, in Genoa.\nLuigi Rovelli was born in Monza on March 23, 1850. A student of Camillo Boito, he graduated from the Brera Academy. Following the career path of his uncle, Giuseppe Rovelli, who between 1860 and 1870 renovated the Villa Rossi Martini in Sestri Ponente, Villa Vivaldi Pasqua in Cornigliano, and the Villa Duchessa di Galliera in Voltri.\nAfter moving to Liguria with his uncle, he quickly demonstrated his ability to meet the demands of the local nobility and bourgeoisie. In Arenzano, in 1885, he completely renovated the Villa Negrotto Cambiaso, altering its facades in a distinctly medieval style and adding several new structures and a new wall along the western pedestrian path via Vernazza. The building did not undergo any restoration until 2005, under the direction of architect Arcangelo Mazzella, who also restored the heraldic gallery on the facade, showcasing mainly the coats of arms of the Genoese patrician families and other allied and politically close families to the Pallavicino family. The villa in Arenzano is interesting as it includes a tower with foundations dating back to 1250.\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Rovelli also undertook the restoration and expansion of the nearby Villa Figoli (1880). He is credited with designing the villas on the Montesano hill, behind the Genova Brignole railway station, as well as landscaping the garden and loggia of Villa Sauli in Carignano.\nIn the western part of the Riviera, he created what is considered his masterpiece, which was destroyed in 1951: the Raggio Castle in the former town of Cornigliano Ligure (1881).\nIn the hinterland of Voltri, near the Acquasanta thermal baths, he built a small Venetian Gothic-style villa commissioned by the Giudice family, later acquired by the Verrina family (1880).\nThough he was an engineer, he was recognized as an architect due to the high quality of his works and realizations. Around this time, he was commissioned by the De Ferrari family to design a park and a neo-Gothic castle of significant artistic value on the Isola del Garda.\nHe then worked on numerous civil and religious buildings in Genoa, where he had his studio in Piazza della Meridiana, particularly in the city center, where other notable engineers and architects of the time also operated, including Gino Copped\u00e8, Benvenuto Pesce Maineri, Giuseppe Cannovale, Cesare Gamba, Dario Carbone, Gaetano Orzali, Stefano Cuneo, Raffaele Croce, Giuseppe Tallero, G. B. Carpineti, the Celle brothers, and others. Among his works from this period are the building at number 34 on Via XX Settembre, the Palazzo Balbi Piovera Raggio on Via Balbi (1881), and the facade of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Montallegro in Rapallo (1896). He also designed the monumental tomb of Armando Raggio (1895), known as the \"Duomo di Milano\", located in the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno.\nRovelli also designed the Villa Pignone, located in the Multedo district, constructed towards the end of the 19th century.\nLuigi Rovelli died in Rapallo in 1911. He was adept at interpreting the tastes of the local clientele, alternating between neo-Renaissance or neo-Baroque styles for urban buildings and neo-Gothic or neo-Romanesque forms, especially popular in villa residences.\nHe had a son, Antonio, who continued his career as an architect and designed the cantilevered loggia of Villa Mylius, overlooking the Fiera di Genova.\n",

    "Stage show\nThe National Lampoon Show, a spinoff of the humor magazine National Lampoon, was a 1974\u20131976 stage show that helped launch the performing careers of John Belushi, Brian Doyle-Murray, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, and Harold Ramis. The company's stage successor to National Lampoon's Lemmings (1973), some skits from the show made their way into the 1978 film, National Lampoon's Animal House.\nThe show was produced by Ivan Reitman. It was mostly written improvisationally by its original cast (\"overlooked\" by National Lamppoon writer/editor Sean Kelly).\nThe National Lampoon Show toured colleges in the U.S. in 1974, including Rider University, Slippery Rock University, and the University of Texas at Arlington, with those productions directed by cast member Belushi. It opened Off-Broadway in New York City at the New Palladium Club (51st Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues) on February 17, 1975, directed by Martin Charnin. The original Off-Broadway cast starred Belushi, Doyle-Murray, Bill Murray, Radner, and Ramis. It ran for 180 performances, closing in July 1975. After closing in New York, it went on a second, nine-month-long, national tour.\nShortly after the show closed in New York, Belushi and Radner joined the original cast of Saturday Night Live, with the Murray brothers soon joining the SNL cast as well. Ramis, meanwhile, used some of the sketches from the show in the script of National Lampoon's first film production, Animal House, released in 1978.\nDescription\nThe National Lampoon Show was a satirical revue, mixing social and political satire. It was characterized by aggressive humor, frequently targeting and insulting the audience, with the cast openly expressing disdain for the spectators. The show was a mix of sadistic and masochistic elements, characterized by crude, ghoulish, and boundary-pushing humor.\nOne skit was a parody of a television fundraiser in which Patty Hearst (played by Radner), dressed in SLA garb, asked viewers for money to pay for weaponry. (The skit ended with Hearst shooting her fianc\u00e9 Steven Weed.) Another skit involved  Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis being a panelist on a celebrity game show who is so startled by the sound of a starting pistol that she ducks under her seat. Songs included one about white-collar criminals living comfortably in prison and another being a manic celebration of New York City's mundane aspects (featuring Bill Murray).\nCast\nThe cast included:\nJohn Belushi\nJoe Flaherty\nBrian Doyle-Murray\nBill Murray\nGilda Radner\nHarold Ramis\nLater cast replacements:\nRichard Belzer (replacing Harold Ramis)\nBarry Diamond\nLarry Dilg\nEllen Foley (replacing Mimi Kennedy)\nChristopher Guest\nJim Hosbein\nPaul Jacobs\nMeat Loaf (replacing Belushi)\nMimi Kennedy (replacing Radner)\nProduction\nWriters\nThe writers included:\nJohn Belushi\nJoe Flaherty\nBrian Doyle-Murray\nBill Murray\nGilda Radner\nHarold Ramis\nJanis Hirsch\nProducers\nIvan Reitman\n\"Sean Kelly Production supervised by Dale Anglund\"\nDirectors\nJohn Belushi (1974 touring production)\nMartin Charnin (Off-Broadway)\nMusic\nPaul Jacobs (music director)\nJim Steinman\nReception\nThe New York Times gave the production a negative review, writing that the show \"set new boundaries for impropriety. But... it does not match its bad taste with good humor.\" Comparing the show unfavorably to Lemmings (which it characterized as \"half of a very funny evening\"), it cited The National Lampoon Show as being half as clever. The reviewer felt that despite some standout performances, particularly by Belushi, the show fell short in execution, leaving a gap between its ambitious ideas and their comedic realization.\n1977 production\nIn 1977, a version of the show, with new material and with a totally new cast \u2014 Eleanor Reissa, Wendy Goldman, Andrew Moses, and Rodger Bumpass \u2014 performed at the The Cellar Door in Washington, D.C. in 1977. Continuing the themes of sharp social commentary, absurdity, and irreverence, this version primarily focused on issues like drugs, environmental concerns (such as humpback whales), rock music, religion, and romantic relationships. Impressions and parodies of famous personalities included John Denver, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, James Taylor, Neil Young, and Diana Ross, as well as a rapid-fire parody of Rod McKuen's answering machine.\nHighlights include a condensed, comedic adaptation of Moby-Dick and a spoof of Waiting for Godot. The performers transition swiftly between skits, covering various scenarios such as an acid-tripped operating-room drama, a blues song about middle-class liberalism, a mock appeal for a \"Stamp Out Jerry Lewis Fund,\" and a humorous sermon on God as a sales opportunity. Other sketches featured life in a singles bar, a confessional, a television pitch for a fictional \"School of Dope-Dealing,\" and a satirical sportscast suggesting Olympic gymnastics should be X-rated.\nThe production was backed by an electric rockabilly group called Michael Simmons and Sluefoot.\nSee also\nThe National Lampoon Radio Hour\nTha",
    "Australian left-wing political activist and writer\nGuido Carlo Luigi Baracchi (11 December 1887 \u2013 13 December 1975) was an Australian left-wing political activist and writer. He was independently wealthy and associated with a variety of causes. He was an anti-war activist during World War I and was involved with the Wobblies. In 1920 he was a foundation member of the Communist Party of Australia (CPA), from which he was expelled twice; he was also involved with communist parties in England and Germany and spent time in the Soviet Union. His second expulsion from the CPA in 1940 was for association with Trotskyism, for which he continued to advocate. He eventually joined the mainstream Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1962.\nEarly life\nBaracchi was born on 11 December 1887 in South Yarra, Victoria. He was the only child of Kate (n\u00e9e Petty) and Pietro Baracchi. His mother was an Australian, while his father was an Italian-born astronomer who arrived in Australia in 1876 and became Victoria's government astronomer and a president of the Royal Society of Victoria.\nBaracchi was educated at Melbourne Grammar School and studied classics at the University of Melbourne from 1904 to 1905, although he did not graduate. In later life he recalled that he had attended kindergarten with Richard Casey, school with S. M. Bruce and university with Robert Menzies.\nBarrachi's parents both left him substantial inheritances which meant he had no need to work. His mother, who came from a \"family of wealthy butchers\", died in 1908 and left an inheritance of \u00a332,519 (equivalent to $2,580,000 in 2022). By 1922 he was reportedly earning \u00a31,000 per year (equivalent to $50,000 in 2022) from his mother's estate. After his father's death in 1926 he inherited a further \u00a332,679 (equivalent to $1,470,000 in 2022).\nActivism\nAs a young man Baracchi considered himself a guild socialist. During World War I he \"took a leading part in the anti-war movement\" and in 1918 was convicted of offences under the War Precautions Act 1914, serving a three-month gaol sentence after refusing to pay the fine levied by the court. With encouragement from Lesbia Harford he joined the International Industrial Workers \u2013 created in place of the banned Industrial Workers of the World \u2013 and edited its journal Industrial Solidarity.\nBaracchi was a founding member of the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) in 1920 and was co-editor with Percy Laidler of its official journal the Proletarian Review. In the early 1920s he spent several years in Europe, joining the Communist Party of Germany and editing the English-language edition of International Press Correspondence. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1924.\nAfter returning to Australia, Baracchi was expelled from the CPA in 1925 after advocating for its dissolution on the grounds that it had failed to develop sufficient support. From 1926 to 1929 he lectured in economics at the pro-communist Victorian Labour College, which he had helped to establish. In 1932, Baracchi was refused readmission to the CPA but was entrusted with carrying correspondence to the Soviet Union on the party's behalf. He remained in Russia for over a year, working as a translator at the Co-Operative Publishing Society for Foreign Workers.\nBaracchi was eventually re-admitted to the CPA in 1935. He moved to Sydney two years later where he was co-editor of the Communist Review. He was expelled from the party again in 1940 for his support for Trotskyism, which clashed with the Stalinist views of the party leadership. He subsequently \"joined the small but eloquent group of Trotskyists in Sydney, speaking at their public meetings and contributing to their publications\". He eventually joined the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1962, but continued to advocate for socialism.\nPersonal life\nBaracchi was legally married four times and had another de facto marriage. In 1918 he married Kathleen Tobin, an actress who had a daughter from a previous relationship. In 1922 Kathleen petitioned for divorce on the grounds that he had committed adultery with Harriett \"Neura\" Zander (n\u00e9e\u00a0Whiteaway), a clothing designer. Zander's husband simultaneously petitioned for divorce on the same grounds, with both petitions granted.\nBaracchi and Zander married in London in 1923, but later divorced. In 1933 he began a relationship with playwright Betty Roland. They separated in 1942 and in 1946 he married for a third time to Ula Maddocks (n\u00e9e\u00a0Gray), a nurse. That marriage also ended in divorce and in 1962 he married artist Ethel Carson (n\u00e9e\u00a0Cramp), an artist; he was widowed in 1971.\nBaracchi died on 13 December 1975 in Penrith, New South Wales, aged 88, while campaigning for the ALP at the 1975 federal election.\n",

They can be treated with medical interventions or prevented before they happen.\nDeterminants\nAgent\nInfectious agent (also known as pathogen) \u2013 a biological entity (microscopic or macroscopic) that causes disease or illness in its host by invading and multiplying within the host's body, disrupting its normal physiological functions and leading to clinical symptoms (i.e. an infectious disease).\nBiofilm - sticky microbial communities adhering to surfaces, facilitating bacterial survival and resistance to treatments.\nGerm theory of disease - paradigm that microorganisms are the principal causative agents of infectious diseases.\nInfectivity - ability of a pathogen to establish itself and cause infection in a susceptible host\nInfectious dose - quantity of pathogen required to cause infection in a host organism.\nPathogenicity - ability of a pathogenic microorganism to cause disease in a host organism.\nAttack rate \u2013 proportion of a population of susceptible individuals who get infected and develop illness during an outbreak over a certain period of time.\nQuorum sensing - Cell-to-cell communication system used by some pathogenic bacteria, potentially triggering virulence factor production.\nVirulence - degree of pathogenicity, measured by the severity of an infectious disease based on damage caused and the host's immune response.\nEndotoxin - toxin released from the outer membrane of certain gram-negative bacteria, triggering inflammation.\nExotoxin - toxin secreted by bacteria into the surrounding environment (damaging host tissue)\nCase fatality rate - proportion (percentage) of individuals diagnosed with a specific infectious disease who die from it.\nVirulence factors - molecule or characteristic possessed or structure produced by pathogens that increase their ability to cause disease in a host organism.\nAntimicrobial resistance (including antibiotic resistance) - ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of medications designed to kill or inactivate them.\nDrug resistance - reduction in effectiveness of a medication such as an antimicrobial or an antineoplastic in treating a disease.\nHorizontal gene transfer - Transfer of genetic material between different organisms of the same generation, allowing them to acquire new traits, including resistance to antibiotics.\nMultidrug-resistant bacteria/Superbug - bacteria resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics, with limited treatment options.\nHost tropism - preference of a pathogen for a particular host species, cell type, or tissue.\nPathogens and related disciplines\nThere are mainly seven types of pathogenic microorganisms: viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, other parasites and abnormal proteins called prions.\nBacteria \u2013 microscopic single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus, some of which can cause infections in humans.\nBacterial diseases \u2013 diseases caused by bacteria.\nBacteriology \u2013 study of bacteria, their characteristics, growth, and role in infectious diseases.\nViruses - microscopic pathogens consisting of genetic material surrounded by a protein coat, requiring living cells of host organisms to replicate.\nViral disease \u2013 diseases caused by viruses.\nVirology \u2013 study of viruses, their structure, replication, and role in viral diseases.\nPrions \u2013 infectious agents composed solely of misfolded proteins, causing neurodegenerative disorders.\nPrion diseases \u2013 progressive, incurable, and fatal neurodegenerative diseases associated with prions, affecting humans and animals.\nFungi \u2013 eukaryotic spore-forming organisms distinct from plants, animals, and bacteria including single-cell yeasts and multi-cell molds, some of which can cause infections in humans.\nFungal infection/Mycosis/Fungal disease \u2013 infection (and infectious disease) caused by fungi.\nMycology \u2013 study of fungi, their growth, and their role in fungal infections.\nParasite - organism benefitting at the cost of a host organism.\nParasitic disease\u00a0\u2013 infectious disease caused or transmitted by a parasitePages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nParasitology \u2013 study of parasites, their life cycles, and the diseases they cau",
    "Indian politician and activist (born 1969)\nIn this Portuguese name, the first or maternal family name is Mendon\u00e7a and the second or paternal family name is Fernandes.\nCaptain Viriato Hipolito de Mendon\u00e7a e Fernandes, OVS, OVM (born 4 February 1969) is an Indian politician, social activist, engineer, and former Indian Navy officer who serves as a Member of Parliament, representing South Goa  in the Lok Sabha. A member of the Indian National Congress (INC), during his early years as a navy officer he was part of the Operation Talwar during the Kargil War. Having served 26 years in the Indian Navy, post-retirement he switched to activism in the state of Goa before joining politics in 2021.\nEarly life and military career (1969\u20132017)\nViriato Hipolito de Mendon\u00e7a e Fernandes was born on 4 February 1969 in Mapusa, Goa to Prudente Fernandes and Viviana de Mendon\u00e7a Fernandes. He received his early education at St. Clara High School and Don Bosco High School Panjim. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Goa University in 1992. Later in his career, he pursued postgraduate studies, obtaining a postgraduate diploma in Business Administration in Operations in 2015 and another in Supply Chain Management in 2017 from an unspecified institution. Fernandes also holds a Certificate in Contract Management from the University of Southampton. After completing his undergraduate engineering degree, Fernandes joined the Indian Navy on 12 August 1991. He commenced his naval career at INS Mandovi in Verem, Goa. Subsequently, Fernandes was stationed at INS Shivaji in Lonavala, Maharashtra, where he specialized in marine engineering for a span of two years. Following this assignment, he was transferred to INS Ranjit, a Russian destroyer, and later assumed the role of senior engineer aboard INS Anjadip.\nFernandes developed a fascination with aviation over the course of his career. In the early 1990s, he pursued advanced aeronautical training in Cochin, India, with a focus on mastering the piloting of diverse aircraft types, including Chetak helicopters, Sea Harrier jets, and Dornier turboprop planes. After completing this specialized program, Fernandes was appointed as an air engineering officer at INS Hansa, a major Indian naval air station located in Goa. He served with the Indian Navy's INAS 310 squadron, which was colloquially known as \"The Cobras\". Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated in the late 1990s, leading to Fernandes being deployed to the Indo-Pakistani border region to conduct aerial reconnaissance missions during Pokhran-II. In this capacity, he and his fellow aviators monitored the movements and activities of Pakistani aircraft and military forces. Around this time, a Dornier aircraft unit was established at Cochin, designated the \"Flying Fish\". While stationed there, Fernandes welcomed the birth of his daughter, though the prevailing state of tensions meant he had to leave his young family behind to report for duty during a critical period in early June. The Kargil War that erupted between India and Pakistan involved coordinated operations by all three branches of the Indian armed forces. The Indian Army and Indian Air Force were directly engaged in combat against the infiltrating Pakistani forces, under the codenames Operation Vijay and Operation Safed Sagar, while the Indian Navy conducted supporting naval operations under the name Operation Talwar.\nDuring the Kargil War of 1999 between India and Pakistan, the Indian Navy played a crucial role in establishing a maritime blockade along Pakistan's Arabian Sea coastline. The primary objective of this naval operation was to disrupt the logistical supply of crude oil and other resources from Arab countries to Pakistan, which was supporting Pakistani forces engaged in the conflict. The Indian Navy's air squadron, INAS 550, known as the \"Flying Fish\", coordinated its efforts with the Indian Air Force during the war. This naval unit's activities, combined with the broader maritime blockade, effectively choked off supplies to Pakistani troops, significantly contributing to their defeat in the Kargil War. For his service during this conflict, Fernandes, who was a member of INAS 550, received commendations from the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Naval Command in 2001 and 2008, as well as from the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Naval Command in 2002. In acknowledgment of his contributions during the Kargil War, he was honored with the Operation Vijay Star and Operation Vijay Medal. In addition to his wartime service, Fernandes also experienced the catastrophic tsunami incident in December 2004 while stationed in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He continued his naval aviation career until his early retirement in 2017.\nPolitical career (2021\u2013present)\nFernandes was initially involved with the non-governmental organization (NGO) known as Goencho Avaaz (GA). He was a founding member of the group, which was established in April 2018. Fernandes went on",

    "\nHabu Site (\u571f\u751f\u907a\u8de1, Habu iseki) is an archeological site with a Yayoi period settlement trace located in the Mikazuki neighborhood of the city of Ogi, Saga Prefecture Japan. It was designated as a National Historic Site in 1973.\nOverview\nThe Habu site is located on the edge of the alluvial fan formed by the Gion River and the Hareki River, which run south through the northwestern part of the Saga Plain and flow into the Ariake Sea. This area is dotted with remains of settlements and tombs from the Yayoi to Kofun periods. The site was discovered in 1971 during ecological restoration work on paddy fields that had been damaged by coal mining runoff, and was excavated in 1972. At the Habu site, numerous wooden farming tools, stone tools, and Yayoi pottery have been excavated around the traces of five structures, and are considered important in elucidating Yayoi Period agricultural societies and exchanges with the Korean Peninsula. Because this site is located at a high groundwater level, an abundance of organic matter such as wood products and plant seeds has been excavated. Wooden products include farm tools such as hoes (two two-pronged and one three-pronged), four hollowed-out containers, and one black lacquered bowl. Plant-based remains include carbonized rice, and plum, peach, and gourd seeds. Based on the style of pottery excavated, it is believed to be the remains date from the early to middle of the Yayoi period. The site measures approximately 150 meters from north-to-south and 250 meters from east-to-west.\nThe 15 wooden pillar foundations associated with the remains of the dwellings are around 30-centimetersi n diameter, and have holes at the bottom which would have allowed them to be joined into a raft for river transportation.\nCurrently, three pit dwellings and one raised-floor storehouse have been restored as an archaeological park. The site is about a 15-minute walk from Ogi Station on the JR Kyushu Karatsu Line.\nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Saga)\n",

    "1931 mutiny in Peru\nThe 1931 Santa Catalina mutiny took place on March 23, 1931, at the Santa Catalina Fort, located in the neighbourhood of Barrios Altos of Lima, Peru. The mutiny was led by Second sergeant V\u00edctor Faustino Huapaya Chac\u00f3n and involved practically the entire troop of the 5th Infantry Regiment. However, Sergeant Huapaya did not have any political objective and the mutiny was quickly defeated by troops under the command of the commander Gustavo Jim\u00e9nez.\nThe mutiny occurred during the political crisis of the transitional government of the National Government Junta led by David Samanez Ocampo.\nBackground\nMain article: History of Peru (1919\u20131930)\nPresident Augusto B. Legu\u00eda, who had governed Peru for 11 years, was overthrown by a coup d'\u00e9tat promoted by EP commander Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro in 1930. As a result of said coup, S\u00e1nchez Cerro began to govern the country through a Military Junta\u00a0.\nHowever, the downfall of Legu\u00eda's government caused a political and social crisis in Peru. The Communist Party and the Aprista Party mobilised and agitated the Peruvian masses, but mainly military uprisings and rebellions were the ones that predominated on the scene. national. Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro resigned from the Military Junta in the face of an imminent civil war, and subsequently, several figures seized the presidency of said junta. Finally, on March 11, 1931, the civilian leader David Samanez Ocampo assumed its presidency with the objective of calling new general elections that same year.\nMutiny\nOn March 23, 1931, the classes and troops of the 5th Infantry Regiment, quartered, at that time, in the Santa Catalina Barracks, under the command of Sergeant 2nd EP V\u00edctor Faustino Huapaya Chac\u00f3n, mutinied at night, taking the leaders and officers of said regiment hostage in the barracks dining room.\nSergeant Huapaya took possession of a sword and an officer's belt, then they left a small garrison in command of the barracks and took to the streets of Lima with tanks, rifles and machine guns firing shots into the air. In the military parade that they participated in, they occupied the Plaza San Mart\u00edn, the university park, the towers of the Basilica and the churches of La Merced and Santo Domingo (the bells rang), but when they tried to attack the Ministry of Government and besiege the Government Palace They were repelled by the Republican Guard. At that time, the government gave the order to suppress the insurrectional movement that had been brewing in the capital. The Communist Party of Peru tried to take advantage of this riot and encouraged workers and soldiers to fraternise in the streets. Sergeant Huapaya did not have any plan or any specific objective to follow, his movement had no future and lacked political direction. Given this context, Huapaya managed to return to the Santa Catalina barracks and entrench himself in that fort.\nThe Santa Catalina barracks was besieged by loyal troops from the Artillery Regiment No. 2, the Chorrillos Military School and the \"Republican Guard\" Regiment, leading to a shootout. After a few moments, a parliamentarian left the barracks in search of dialogue with the government authorities. The Minister of War, Commander EP Gustavo Jim\u00e9nez, the Minister of Government and Police, Francisco Tamayo and a group of officers responded to the proposal and entered the barracks, personally meeting with the rebel sergeant who was accompanied by 20 classes, who introduced them a list of demands from the mutineers. In said document the following claims were made:\nRepeal of all resolutions and decrees that prevented the aspirations of sergeants to be officers.\nExecution of former President Augusto B. Legu\u00eda and his main henchmen within 48 hours for having betrayed the Homeland.\nSeparation from service of all senior leaders of the army.\nConstruction of hygienic barracks.\nSales to the military with discounts for commercial houses and half-admission charge to those shows.\nPayment of tips regularly.\nImprovements in the ranch and in the treatment of soldiers.\nCommander Jim\u00e9nez rejected the list of demands. The fighting resumed and, as it continued, two planes dropped grenades in the courtyard of the barracks. At that, the rebels surrendered. Among dead and wounded there were more than 40 casualties in total.\nAftermath\nSergeant V\u00edctor Faustino Huapaya Chac\u00f3n was sentenced to 20 years in prison by the War Council. However, the same Government Junta granted him an amnesty. After leaving prison, Huapaya declared himself a follower of Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro and stated that his mutiny had been in favor of said leader.\nIn Villanueva's opinion \"the Huapaya uprising demonstrated the insurrectional epidemic that the army was suffering.\"\nThe government believed that behind the mutiny were the actions of the Communist Party of Peru and alleged collaborators of the Sanchez Cerro regime. Apparently, a faction of communists had entered Lima to contact the CGTP and its party, due to S\u00e1nchez Cerro havi",
    "Australian rules football club\nThe Southbank Football Club, nicknamed the Bankers, was an Australian rules football club based in the Melbourne suburb of Southbank that competed in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA).\nThe club was formed in 1990 as State Commonwealth Bank following a merger of State Bank and Commonwealth Bank, before changing its name to Southbank in 1994.\nIn late 1998, the club merged with Prahran Football Club, although the name \"Southbank Amateur Football Club\" remains registered with the VAFA.\nHistory\nState Bank\nColours of State Bank\nThe State Bank Football Club was formed in 1927 as the State Savings Bank of Victoria Football Club, and entered the VAFA (then known as the MAFA) the same year. The club was sponsored by the State Savings Bank of Victoria.\nState Savings Bank won the C Section premiership in its first season, and was promoted to B Section. However, a second C Section premiership did not come until 1961, and a third premiership came in E Section in 1972.\nThe club was one of several that opposed the VAFA executive's decision to curtail the 1940 season due to World War II, instead advocating for continuing the season until the government requested a cessation.\nWhen the State Savings Bank of Victoria was renamed to State Bank in 1977, the club also changed its name.\nIn its final season in 1990, the club won the D Section premiership, defeating Whitefriars by 21 points.\nCommonwealth Bank\nThe Commonwealth Bank Football Club was formed in 1919 and sponsored by the Commonwealth Bank.\nThe club joined the Victorian Banks Football Association (VBFA) after its formation, however the VBFA was disbanded in 1931 and the club went into recess.\nIn 1946, Commonwealth Bank was reformed and joined the VAFA the following year in 1947. The club won the C Section premiership the same year, which was followed by a B Section premiership in 1950. However, the club would not win another grand final until its C Section premiership in 1969, which would turn out to be its final premiership.\nIn its final season in 1990, the club made the F Section grand final but was defeated by St Mary's.\nMerger and new club\nIn late 1990, the State Bank of Victoria was sold to the Commonwealth Bank, and the respective clubs were forced to merge as a result. The merged club entered the VAFA as the State Commonwealth Bank Football Club (also stylised as State/Commonwealth Bank) for the 1991 season, officially nicknamed the \"Cobras\".\nThe club again changed its name in 1992, returning to simply \"Commonwealth Bank\".\nAhead of the 1994 season, the Commonwealth Bank ended its sponsorship and the club was renamed to Southbank Football Club (officially known as Southbank CBA Amateur Football Club).\nSouthbank won the E South Section premiership in 1997, going undefeated for the entire season. The reserves team also won the premiership, however they suffered a single defeat in the second semi-final.\nAmalgamation with Prahran\nAt the end of the 1994 Victorian Football Association (VFA) season, the Prahran Football Club left the VFA as part of the Victorian State Football League's efforts to reduce the size of the competition and align it with the TAC Cup. However, the club did not immediately join a new competition, and instead went into recess. Around six Prahran players joined Southbank for the 1995 VAFA season.\nFollowing the 1998 VAFA season, in which Southbank had lost the D Section grand final, the club merged with Prahran, who subsequently returned to the playing field for the 1999 VAFA season.\nThe merger followed works beginning at Southbank's home ground to build John Cain Arena, while Prahran was no longer in debt and sought to return to playing again.\nHonours\nSeasons\n",

    "1994 studio album by the Walter Trout Band\nTellin' Stories is the fourth solo studio album by American blues rock musician Walter Trout, credited to the Walter Trout Band. Recorded between August and September 1993 at Battery Studios in London, England, it was produced by Tony Platt and released on June 28, 1994, as Trout's only album for Silvertone Records. The album reached number 66 on the Dutch Albums Chart, number 84 on the UK Albums Chart and number 4 on the UK Jazz & Blues Albums Chart.\nBackground\nAhead of recording his fourth solo studio album, Walter Trout signed with American record label Silvertone Records, then part of BMG. This marked his departure for the first time from Dutch label Provogue Records, which had issued his first three studio albums and first live album between 1989 and 1993. Silvertone had initially approached Trout with the intention of signing him to its European label; however, Trout recalled that he replied, \"We need a deal in America, because we're doing fine in Europe,\" with the Los Angeles Times reporting that the deal was signed to \"finally give  a chance to make a name for himself in his own country\".\nRecording for the Walter Trout Band's first album for Silvertone took place between August 23 and September 24, 1993, at Battery Studios in London. The band's lineup featured returning members Jimmy Trapp on bass and Bernard Pershey on drums, with new keyboardist Martin Gerschwitz taking over from former member Danny \"Mongo\" Abrams, who had moved to the United States before sessions began. The album was released by Silvertone Records on June 28, 1994.\nTellin' Stories was Trout's only release for Silvertone Records, after which he returned to Provogue. In a review of the album's 1995 follow-up Breaking the Rules, Mike Boehm of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Last year was supposed to be the year Walter Trout finally made a name in his own country.  But Trout's first U.S. release, Tellin' Stories, received virtually no promotion from the blues-oriented Silvertone label, and he had to continue basing his career, as he has since 1989, on his strong reception in the European market.\" In a 1999 interview, Trout recalled that \"I did one album for Silvertone and the reason I went with them cause they said we'll put a record out in America for you if you come with us\", adding that \"what they did consequently was, they didn't do a very good job for me, either in Europe or America\".\nReception\nCommercial\nTellin' Stories reached number 66 on the Dutch Albums Chart \u2013 the lowest position of any Walter Trout solo album up to that point. Due to its wider geographical release, the album was also Trout's first to chart in the UK, reaching number 84 on the UK Albums Chart and number 4 on the UK Jazz & Blues Albums Chart.\nCritical\nMedia response to Tellin' Stories was mixed. Music & Media praised Trout's performance on the album, writing: \"All tricks we know from his mean live act, Trout uses on this Silvertone label debut. The guitar hero relentlessly spanks the plank, as if he's chased by Jimi's ghost.\" Hi-Fi World was similarly positive in its review, describing the album as \"rousing\" and suggesting that it \"comes highly recommended for anyone with memories long enough \u2013 or record collections wide enough \u2014 to encompass the likes of Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers, and George Thorogood and the Destroyers\".\nRobert Lucas' review for the Los Angeles Times, however, was more critical. Lucas began his review by claiming that \"while it isn't his strongest album, it should establish the blues-rocker from Huntington Beach as a leading contender in the guitar-hero sweepstakes\". The review highlighted Trout's \"excessive style\" on the record, with Lucas calling the album \"a bit overstuffed\" as well as criticising the \"flat and cluttered\" mixing of the album; however, he praised the album for its \"melodic hooks\", its variety of styles, and Trout's \"hot guitar playing\". In a review of the 1995 follow-up Breaking the Rules for the same publication, Mike Boehm claimed that Tellin' Stories was \"Trout's weakest record\", despite featuring \"his customarily volcanic guitar work\".\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Walter Trout, except where noted\nPersonnel\nWalter Trout Band\nWalter Trout \u2013 vocals, guitar, harmonica\nJimmy Trapp \u2013 bass\nBernard Pershey \u2013 drums, percussion\nMartin Gerschwitz \u2013 keyboards\nAdditional musicians\nMonica Reid-Price \u2013 backing vocals\nOle Onabule \u2013 backing vocals\nBernie Marsden \u2013 backing vocals\nMicky Moody \u2013 slide guitar on track 6\nThe Tingewick Horns \u2013 horns on track 6\nAdditional personnel\nTony Platt \u2013 production, engineering\nTim Latham \u2013 engineering, mixing\nSarah Bedingham \u2013 engineering assistance\nGreig Sangster \u2013 engineering assistance\nCharts\nFootnotes\n^ Trout is also credited under the alias \"Wally Bass\" with performing backing vocals.\n",
    "2024 Natural disaster in Germany\nIn 2024, Germany experienced flooding. In particular, in June 2024, significant flooding struck Southern Germany, leading to the death of 6 people and the failure of several dams in the region, requiring the evacuation of several municipalities and rescue missions.\nMay\nOn 2 May, slowly moving thunderstorms caused flooding in several places. In Hausen, a man died in a cellar.\nOn 17 May 2024, floods and landslides occurred in Saarland after over 100 liters of rain per square meter came down in less than 24 hours. Evacuations in the region were required.A woman in Saarbr\u00fccken was injured during an evacuation and later died. Ottweiler was inundated after a nearby dam broke.A red cross member ded shortly after a recue operation from heart failure.\nInsured damage in Saarland and Rheinland-Pfalz was estimated to be at least 200 Million Euros.\nJune\nIn June 2024, significant flooding struck Southern Germany, striking the most in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria. Dozens of villages had to be evacuated across Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria due to the straining and potential failure of several dams and dykes caused by the persistent heavy rainfall. Many places had more rainfall in 24 hours than their whole monthly average, and in many areas, the water reached levels that were present only \"once in a century\" according to the Bavarian Flood Information Service.\nAmong the rivers whose water levels significantly rose include the Danube, the Isar, the Zusam, the Weilach, the Ilm, the Paar, the Schmutter, the Roth, and the Leibi.\nAn inflatable rescue raft containing four firefighters capsized while evacuating citizens in Pfaffenhofen from floodwaters from the overflowing Ilm River, resulting in the death of one firefighter. Another firefighter was missing, as well as a woman in Schrobenhausen which was later found dead. An employee working at an energy company in Freising suffered critical injuries after receiving an electrical shock during the floods.\nNordendorf mayor Tobias Kunz noted that the flooding began to grow into an emergency starting at 06:00 am (GMT+2) caused by overflowing of the River Schmutter, requiring the use of 40,000 sandbags to construct a 240-meter-long dike to restrict the flooding. The dam located near a Nordendorf school sports field burst, submerging and destroying the \u20ac1 million property.\nCarriages of a train were derailed by a landslide caused by the heavy raining near Schwaebisch Gmund. None of the 185 passengers were injured.\nSentinel-1 false colour satellite image on 2 June 2024 showing the vicinity of Augsburg.

In Diedorf, a dam and a dyke broke, and an underground car park and several surrounding house basements were flooded. Wiesensteig residents were told to boil water due to the flooding of water treatment facilities.\nOn 3 June 2024, rescuers recovered the body of a woman in Schrobenhausen, believed to have drowned while trapped in an apartment basement. Two more bodies were discovered in a cellar in Schorndorf. The highest level of flood warning, at level four, was placed on the districts from Regensburg to Straubing. In the meantime, heavy rainfall in Switzerland led to rising water levels in rivers and lakes, including the Sitter river at Goldach, Lake Constance, the High Rhine, and caused overflow at the Untersee and Lake Lauerz.\nThe following day, reports indicated that the Danube's water level at Passau had risen to 10 metres (33\u00a0ft), with this increase extending downstream into Austria and Hungary.\nOn 4 June, a 57 year old woman lost control with her car on a flooded road. She was later found dead. The Falkenstein Castle in Upper Bavaria partially collapsed to the north due to heavy rainfall, causing the evacuation of 50 residents under the castle complex.\nOn 5 June, a 79 year old woman which was missing since 2 June was found dead.\nOn 7 June, insured damage was estimated by german insurers to be at least 2 Billion Euros in the states of Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\nSee also\nList of floods in Europe\n2024 France floods\n2024 United Kingdom floods\n",
    "Bosnian Serb military officer (1957\u20131992)\nBranko Panteli\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u045b; 6 September 1957 \u2013 4 September 1992) was a lieutenant colonel in the Army of Republika Srpska.\nBiography\nBranko Panteli\u0107 was born in Stubline near Obrenovac on 6 September 1957. He completed primary school in Stubline, and then frequented school in Belgrade, where he graduated in 1977. He continued his education in Belgrade, where he entered the Military Academy. He graduated in 1981 and got his first job in Ni\u0161, where he worked for six months, and then he was transferred to Knja\u017eevac.\nHe married Valentina in 1988, when he received a military command in Zaje\u010dar. He had 2 daughters: Kristina and Maria. Between 1988 and 1989 he was reassigned to Pristina, where he worked in the \"Marshal Tito\" barracks, where he became a major. In 1989, he transferred to Prizren where he worked until 1991. In the same year, right before the start of the Bosnian War, he attended the Command and Staff Academy, which he did not manage to finish because he has to serve in Eastern Slavonia, which was home of most clashes troughout the beginning of the War in Croatia. After that, he went to Vukovar where he was the commander of the territorial defense.\nBranko Panteli\u0107 with the flag of the Serb Democratic Party\nHe remained in Vukovar until the beginning of the Bosnian War. First he went to Ugljevik, and then to Bijeljina with the task of reorganizing the formation of the SAO Semberija which, with him in command, achieved great results in the battles in a short time and saved a large number of lives, including both civilians and soldiers. Branko was famous for his most important action, the Smolu\u0107a Operation, where several thousand people were rescued from a hostile environment.\nShortly after Smolu\u0107a, Branko was killed in Rasto\u0161nica during an offensive on Priboj and Teo\u010dak on 4 September 1992, just two days before his birthday. After his death, the unit he was fighting for took the name \"Garda Pantheri\" as a sign of memory and respect for the fallen commander, and a stylized emblem with the image of a jumping panther was created. He was posthumously awarded the Star of Kara\u0111or\u0111e with a silver sword for military merit in 1994. He was buried on September 9 in Stubline.\n",
    "Russian gas mask during World War I\nThe Zelinsky-Kummant gas mask is the world's first gas mask with the ability to absorb a wide range of chemical warfare agents. The gas mask was developed in 1915 by Russian chemist Nikolay Zelinsky and technologist of the Triangle plant M.I. Kummant. The design was later improved by I. D. Avalov and entered mass production. After adoption by the Imperial Russian Army during World War I, casualties from chemical attacks decreased sharply.\nSoldiers of the 267th Dukhovshchinsky Infantry Regiment wearing Zelinsky-Kummant gas masks, 1916\nSoldiers of the Czechoslovak Legion in Zelinsky-Kummant gas masks, 1916\u20131917\nSoldier wearing a gas mask, photo from the U.S. Army War College\nRussian soldiers in Zelinsky-Kummant gas masks, photographed by an American photographer, 1917\nThe gas mask preserved in a Finnish museum\nHistory\nEarly protection from chemical weapons were \"wet masks,\" which were bandages soaked in a solution of hyposulfite, sodium phenolate, methenamine, etc. They functioned based on the chemical binding of toxic substances and were widely used on the fronts of World War I. However, in addition to the obvious difficulties with use in combat conditions, they only helped against a narrow range of gases (of which several dozen were already in use by 1915). Therefore, chemists searched for nonspecific adsorbents with the greatest absorption capacity. The Germans used diatomaceous earth with pumice, while specialists from the Mining Institute used a mixture of slaked lime and caustic soda lime. After numerous experiments, Nikolay Zelinsky suggested activated birch or linden charcoal.\nBy summer of 1916, several hundred thousand soldiers were fumigated, and in total the army received 5,030,660 gas masks. Since spring 1917, gas masks were no longer issued to combat units. Troops continued to suffer significant losses from chemical weapons: units on the front line received gas masks without a supply, and fresh reinforcements to the unit were not provided with RPE.\nFlaws\nThe activated carbon filter perfectly absorbed chlorine at a relatively low concentration. Later, shells and mines were used for chemical attacks; and they were equipped with phosgene, hydrocyanic acid, and other toxic substances. This increased the concentration of toxic substances and changed their chemical composition; and it turned out that in the new conditions, activated carbon alone does not provide the required duration of protection. For example, at a phosgene concentration of 1%, filters began to pass it in less than 6 minutes - while an English filter (with the addition of soda lime with potassium permanganate, in addition to activated carbon) could absorb 5 times more phosgene. Similarly, at a hydrocyanic acid concentration of 0.1%, the service life of Zelinsky filters with activated carbon alone was nine minutes, and with the addition of a chemical absorber took one hour and five minutes. By 1918, English, French, American and German gas mask filters were filled with both activated carbon and chemical absorbers, but in Russia until the very end of the war, they continued to believe in the universality of activated carbon, contrary to the proposals of the Gas Prevention Laboratory of the Chemical Committee at G.A.U. In modern industrial gas masks, activated carbon can be saturated with various additives, that is, additives and chemicals are also used.\nSubstances in the form of aerosols such as fine dust and fog, began to be used for chemical attacks. Small particles passed between large pieces of activated carbon (4\u201311\u00a0mm) unhindered, and there were no aerosol filters in the gas mask boxes.\nAnother disadvantage of gas masks was difficulty breathing. Some soldiers took off their gas masks, and were poisoned. Some soldiers \"fell out of action due to shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness\" to the point of loss of consciousness. This was initially attributed to increased respiratory resistance. Accordingly, they began to change the design of the filter. But even when the amount of absorber was reduced to such a small value that the service life turned out to be unacceptably short, the problem could not be solved. Then measurements showed that exhaled air, with an increased concentration of carbon dioxide and a reduced concentration of oxygen (up to 13%), accumulates in the mask and filter - and is then inhaled again. As a result, its concentration in the inhaled air could reach 5.5% (for comparison, the maximum permissible concentration of CO2: average over 8 hours - 0.5% (average shift); average over 15 minutes (maximum single) - 1.4%; t .e. 9 and 27 grams per 1 cubic meter, respectively). After modifications, the gas mask was equipped with exhalation and inhalation valves, and the concentration of carbon dioxide decreased (to approximately 1.3-3.6%, depending on the gas mask model and type of activity). Even after the alterations, the concentration of oxygen in the inhaled air was reduced, and c",
    "American television anthology series\nThis article is about the NBC television series of 1976 and 1979. For the NBC television series of 1981, see Comedy Theater.\nComedy Theatre is an American anthology television series that aired on NBC in the summers of 1976 and 1979.  The episodes consisted of unsold television pilots for situation comedies.\nBackground\nThe practice of television executives of ordering dozens of pilots for proposed television series each year \u2013 far more than their networks could possibly broadcast as series \u2013 created a sizable body of unsold pilots that had never aired. Packaging these unsold pilots in anthology series and airing them during the summer provided television networks with a way of both providing fresh programming during the summer rerun season and recouping at least some of the expense of producing them. Comedy Theatre was one of these series, aired by NBC in the summers of 1976 and 1979, and it consisted of unsold pilots for situation comedies. Stars appearing in the series included Danny Aiello, Herschel Bernardi, Red Buttons, Harold Gould, Arte Johnson, Rose Marie, Larry Storch, and Carol Wayne.\nBroadcast history\nComedy Theatre ran for six episodes over the course of seven weeks in the summer of 1976, airing on CBS from 8:00 to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday evenings. It premiered on July\u00a026, and its last episode aired on September\u00a06. During its 1976 run, each of its episodes included two unsold pilots, the first airing at 8:00 p.m. and the second at 8:30 p.m.\nAfter a hiatus of nearly three years, Comedy Theatre returned in the summer of 1979, this time in a 30-minute format which aired a single unsold pilot in each episode. Broadcast from 8:30 to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday evenings, it first aired on May\u00a024,\u00a01979 in this new format and ran for six episodes over six consecutive weeks. It left the air for good after its last episode on June\u00a028.\nAccording to one source, an unsold pilot called \"Uptown Saturday Night\" originally was scheduled for broadcast on Comedy Theatre on June\u00a021,\u00a01979, but was pulled from the schedule for unknown reasons. According to another source, \"Uptown Saturday Night\" aired as stand-alone special at 8:00\u00a0p.m.on June\u00a028,\u00a01979, immediately before the final episode of Comedy Theatre.

    "\nThis is a list of rulers of Myinsaing, a prominent vassal state during the Pagan, Pinya and Ava periods. During the Myinsaing Period, Athinkhaya of Myinsaing was one of the three de facto rulers\u2014alongside his younger brothers Yazathingyan and Thihathu\u2014of the rump Pagan Kingdom. \nBackground\nDuring the reign of King Narathihapate of Pagan, Myinsaing was a mere village, whose headman was Theinkha Bo. The village became a myo, a district-level town with a myoza (a royal governor), soon after King Kyawswa of Pagan came to power in 1289. The town's first governor was Theinkha Bo's eldest son Athinkhaya. The town became the de facto capital of the rump Pagan kingdom when Athinkhya and his two brothers\u2014Yazathingyan and Thihathu\u2014together overthrew King Kyawswa in 1297. During the Pinya period, Athinkhaya's successor Sithu was the regent of Pinya from 1340 to 1344.\nCertainly the 19th century, Myinsaing was no longer a royal governorship. It was governed by a mayor, myothugyi although it apparently continued to be a fief awarded to members of the royal family. Myinsaing's last feudal lord was Prince Thado Minye Yanshein, who after the Third Anglo-Burmese War continued the fight against the British occupation forces until his death in 1886.\nList of rulers\nList of lords\nThe following is a list of feudal lords who held Myinsaing as their fief. These lords did not have the day-to-day administrative duties, which were handled by a myothugyi (mayor).\nNotes\n^ Chronicle narratives are as follows: The Maha Yazawin chronicle (1724) says Yazathingyan was appointed governor of Myinsaing by King Kyawswa.The Yazawin Thit (1798) says Athinkhaya was appointed governor by Kyawswa..The Hmannan Yazawin (1832) accepts the Yazawin Thit's correction. It was now a myo, district-level town with a royal appointed governor.\n^ Per a stone inscription dated 19 February 1293, Athinkhaya was the ruler of Myinsaing, Yazathingyan the ruler of Mekkhaya and Thihathu, the ruler of Pinle.\n^ According to a 1329 stone inscription found at Lunbogon, Kyaukse by J.A. Stewart, Yazathingyan succeeded the  throne as Athinkhaya Nge (Athinkhaya the Younger).\n^ The Yazawin Thit says Thettawshay, a son of Min Letwe of Sigyay, was married to a daughter of Shwe Nan Shin of Myinsaing, and the couple had a son named Maha Thinkhaya. In an earlier section, the Yazawin Thit says Thettawshay of Myinsaing was a son-in-law of King Thihathu. The Hmannan only says Thettawshay of Myinsaing was a son-in-law of Thihathu  While it is certainly possible that Thettawshay of Myinsaing was married to daughters of Thihathu and Shwe Nan Shin, a daughter of Thihathu who died in 1325 would likely have been much older than Thettawshay.\n",
    "1967 single by the Moody Blues\n\"Life's Not Life\" is a song written by Denny Laine and Mike Pinder, initially recorded by their group the Moody Blues. The song, inspired by the Four Seasons, was recorded in a period where the band saw little commercial success and instabilities in their line-up, and is their only release to feature Rod Clark on bass. Despite being recorded and sung by Laine in September 1966, Decca Records chose to release the single in January 1967 after guitarist Justin Hayward and bassist John Lodge had replaced him and Clark. The single received extensive radio play, but failed to chart. Reviews of the single were positive upon initial release.\nBackground and composition\n\"Life's Not Life\" was recorded at Decca Studios in London.\nBy mid-1966, British pop band the Moody Blues had hit an all-time low commercially, as none of their singles since 1965's \"Everyday\" had been a chart hit on the UK singles chart, reaching number 44. Dissolution of the music industry, alongside their hectic touring schedule contributed to bassist Clint Warwick departing from the group shortly after a recording session on 5 July 1966. He was replaced by Rod Clark, previously bassist of the Monotones; he made his debut performance with the Moody Blues at the Locarno Ballroom in Coventry on 14 July 1966, followed by another recording session the following day. The recordings were primarily intended to fulfill contractual obligations with Decca Records and their management company Ridgepride; none of these recordings had yet been issued in the UK, where the band hadn't released any music since October 1965.\nAs with most of the Moody Blues' material at the time, \"Life's Not Life\" was penned by guitarist / vocalist Denny Laine and keyboardist Mike Pinder during the summer of 1966, and had been incorporated into their set list and performed on television then. According to writer Geoffrey Freakes, \"Life's Not Life\" is a \"soulful, mid-temp ballad\" that primarily draws inspiration from the Four Seasons contemporary output, especially in the arrangements of the harmonies, piano and flute. The song was recorded at a session booked by producer Denny Cordell at Decca Studios in West Hampstead on 8 September 1966; this session was also intended to fulfill contractual obligations, and additionally produced a re-recording of \"This Is My House (But Nobody Calls)\", \"He Can Win\", \"I Really Haven\u2019t Got the Time\" and \"Red Wine\".\nFree from the contract, Laine announced his departure from the Moody Blues on 24 September 1966; he had been planning on leaving the group since the summer, but refrained from doing so. When Clark left the band for the Rockin' Berries later that month, guitarist Justin Hayward and bassist John Lodge were hired in their respective places; Amidst the publicity in the media, Decca chose to release \"Boulevard de la Madeleine\", featuring Laine and Warwick, as a single in October 1966. It failed to chart.\nRelease and reception\nAs the new line-up featuring Hayward and Lodge had yet recorded any new material owing to their tours of France, Decca released \"Life's Not Life\" as a single on 13 January 1967, backed by \"He Can Win\" which Freakes describes as an homage to merseybeat that sounded like Gerry and the Pacemakers. Decca chose to release \"Life's Not Life\" as the second line-up of the band were trying to establish themselves, leading to some slight confusion by fans over what members performs on the song. Given the band's lack of commercial success during this time, the single failed to reach the UK singles chart; however, it did garner sufficient airplay on Pirate radio stations which caused it to reach Radio London's Fab 40 chart, peaking at 35 for a week. \"Life's Not Life\" was far more successful in France, where it was released on a four-track EP and promoted on television.\n\"Life's Not Life\" received primarily positive reviews in the British press upon release. In Disc and Music Echo, journalist Penny Valentine states that she's always admired the group, comparing them to the Zombies for \"sticking to a very individual style of music\", though notes that it's the \"odd-half notes and key changes\" that's keeping chart success away. She ends her review by positively Laine's \"painfully hurt voice\" and states that it's typically produced by Cordell. Writing for Melody Maker, Chris Hayes considers \"Life's Not Life\" to have a \"nice production\" and a \"somewhat complex arrangement\", noting that it has a chance of returning the band back to commercial success. Hayes ends by noting that it's a \"memorable Laine and Pinder tune\". Derek Johnson of New Musical Express considers the song to have a great arrangement, noting the flute passages by Ray Thomas and predicting that it might return the Moody Blues to the charts. His reviews ends by believing \"it's a sign to come\" regarding their music.\nSince original release, \"Life's Not Life\" has seldom been heard, often obscured by the fact that it was released just prior to Days of F",

    "Political party in Peru\nLo Justo por el Per\u00fa (also known simply as Lo Justo, lit.\u2009'The Just for Peru') is a Peruvian radical centrist political party currently in the process of registration. On 18 January 2024, the party received a reserved name and began the registration process within branches and party committees. The main party initiators are former ministers Marisol P\u00e9rez Tello and Flor Pablo.\nHistory\nThe Lo Justo party emerged in early 2024 as a faction of the Purple Party opposed to party president Luis Dur\u00e1n, who reorganized the party to the detriment of the party's communications wing that had supported Julio Guzm\u00e1n's presidential campaign in the 2021 presidential election. Following the failure of Guillermo Flores' candidacy for mayor of Lima due to documentary errors s, Flor Pablo proposed relaunching the party with another name and logo, because Guzm\u00e1n had registered the trademark with INDECOPI and refused to give it up. By the end of 2023, Pablo, along with Marisol P\u00e9rez Tello, Eduardo Dargent and Daniel Olivares, began talks to form a new party if they failed to change the name and logo of the Purple Party. On 10 January 2024, Pablo sent a letter to Dur\u00e1n urging him to change the name and logo of the Purple Party. On 18 January, Jos\u00e9 Luis M\u00e1rquez Molina, P\u00e9rez Tello's adviser, put forward Lo Justo's name before the National Jury of Elections (JNE). On 2 February, Pablo resigns from the Purple Party; on 14 February, Olivares would do the same; launching the Lo Justo party. Alberto de Bela\u00fande and Gino Costa also joined Lo Justo party.\nLo Justo leaders, Pablo and P\u00e9rez Tello, mentioned that they seek to be a decentralized party, which is why they have also added regional politicians such as Jean Paul Benavente (former governor of Cuzco), Jes\u00fas Ascu\u00f1a L\u00f3pez (local official in Tacna) or Luz Diana Gamboa (former dean of the Ayacucho Bar Association).\nThe party is currently in the registration process and hopes to register before July 2024, as that is the date on which the minimum membership period of 1 year expires in order to be able to apply for the 2026 Peruvian general election, according to the National Jury of Elections's schedule.\n",
    "Former Italian bank\nThe Societ\u00e0 Bancaria Italiana (SBI, lit.\u2009'Italian Banking Company') was a significant Italian bank, based in Milan. It was established in 1904 by renaming of Societ\u00e0 Bancaria Milanese (1898-1904), itsel the successor of Figli Weill Shott & C. (1850-1898). In the early 20th century, it was one of Italy's four dominant universal banks, together with Banca Commerciale Italiana, Credito Italiano, and Banco di Roma.:\u200a14\u200a After narrowly surviving financial distress in 1907 thanks to government intervention, the SBI merged in 1915 with the Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Credito Provinciale\u00a0 to form the Banca Italiana di Sconto.\nOverview\nThe origins of the SBI go back to 1850 when brothers Alberto, Cimone and Filippo Weill Schott, descendants of a family of Jewish bankers originally from Austria, co-founded Figli Weill Shott & C. in Milan. On 13 October 1898, that family bank was reorganized as Societ\u00e0 Bancaria Milanese, a joint-stock company with a share capital of 4 million lire. In 1901, the bank's longstanding president Alberto Weill Schott (1837-1901) died suddenly and was replaced by Count Felice Scheibler. In 1902, it opened a branch in Shanghai to finance the Italian share of the Boxer Indemnities.\nOn 28 October 1904, the Societ\u00e0 Bancaria Milanese changed its name to Societ\u00e0 Bancaria Italiana to signal its nationwide ambition. At the same time, it absorbed the operations of the Banco di Sconto e Sete which had remained in liquidation for years. This made the SBI the third-largest bank in Italy, behind Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano (known colloquially as Comit and Credit), a mitigation of the latter's duopoly that was encouraged by the Bank of Italy and its governor Bonaldo Stringher.:\u200a29\u201333\u200a It soon moved from the old Weill-Schott building on Piazza Belgioioso into a prestigious new head office building on Via Monte Napoleone. In 1905, it participated in an international consortium to establish the Bank of Abyssinia,:\u200a272\u200a and in 1907 led the Italian share in the creation of the State Bank of Morocco.\nThe SBI was more directly affected than its Italian peers by the panic of 1907, which came after signs of weakness that accumulated from the summer of that year, particularly in its branch in Genoa that had developed increasingly autonomously from headquarters in the previous years. A bank run started in late August and gathered pace in September. On 11 October 1907, the Bank of Italy led the formation of a banking consortium to support the SBI, with participation from the Comit and Credit. This failed to prevent a 23-percent fall of the SBI's stock price by end-October, also inducing a decline of the Bank of Italy's own share price. The consortium agreed on a second support package on 7 November 1907, and on 25 November 1907 the Italian treasury added its own direct support. This represented a watershed moment in terms of state intervention to preserve financial stability, not just in Italy but also from a European perspective.:\u200a252\u2013254\u200a:\u200a57\u200a\nOn 22 February 1908, a tumultuous general shareholders' meeting of the SBI was held in Milan, in which participants denounced the lack of accountability of the board of directors. The mismanagement at the bank and especially its Genoa branch was also the matter of numerous lawsuits. Shortly afterwards, the entire management of the SBI was replaced, with new leadership headed by Roberto Calegari, previously director of the Turin branch of the Bank of Italy. This was widely viewed as reflecting Stringher's aim to control the situation, which had already manifested itself with a regulatory change of 31 December 1907 which had strengthened the Bank of Italy's intervention powers. Under this new framework, the SBI was able to return the financial aid received in 1907, and at the end of 1908 the rescue consortium was dissolved, but the bank remained perceived as fragile. In mid-1908 it made unsuccessful attempts at merging with mid-sized regional peers, the Banco della Liguria and Banca Bergamasca di Depositi e Crediti. The SBI's condition only decisively improved in 1911-1912, when French investors offered to inject new capital, first a short-lived attempt by the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier Fran\u00e7ais then a successful one by the recently created Banque Louis-Dreyfus, which secured 7 seats on the 17-strong board of directors. The bank's expansion could restart by opening new branches and buying small local banks, with 24 local offices at end-1912 and 33 at end-1913.\nMeanwhile, the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier Fran\u00e7ais had invested in the Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Credito Provinciale (SICP, until 1911 Banca di Busto Arsizio), and in the charged geopolitical context of 1914, the French government was actively in favor of a combination of the two French-supported banks to check the perception of German influence over Comit (and according to some, over Giovanni Giolitti who was Prime Minister in early 1914). The merger was eventually executed in several steps. On 30 December 1914, the ",

    "Village in West Bank, Palestine\nMunicipality type D in Hebron, State of Palestine\nMa'in (Arabic: \u0645\u0639\u064a\u0646) is a small Palestinian village in the south Hebron Hills of the Hebron Governorate, located 14 kilometers south of Hebron. It is bordered by the villages of at-Tuwani to the east, al-Karmil village to the north, Khallet Salih to the west, and Qawawis to the south. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the village had a population of 459 in 2007.\nThe village is situated immediately to the north of Khirbet Ma'in (Horvat Maon), an archaeological site containing the remains of the ancient town of Ma'on. It is home to members of several clans, including Makhamra, Dababsah, Hamamdah, Muhammad, and Abu Taha.\nName\nMa'in preserves the name of the ancient town of Ma'on, Hebrew for 'dwelling', 'habitation'.\nServices and work\nMa'in village has one religious establishment, the Hamza Mosque. The village lacks any health services, and the nearest health facilities are located in Al-Karmil, 2 kilometers away, or in Yatta, 7 kilometers away.\nDespite having 8,000 dunums of agricultural land, about 80% of Ma'in's labor force works in the Israeli labor market. The remaining 20% are employed in agriculture (18%) and in the public and private sectors (2%).\nDemography\nThe residents of Ma'in belong to several families, including Makhamra, Dababsah, Hamamdah, Muhammad and Abu Taha.\nArchaeological site of Khirbet Ma'in\nMain article: Horvat Maon (Hebron Hills)\nSee also: Maon Synagogue\nMa'in is located just north of Khirbet Ma'in (Horvat Maon), an ancient tell comprising the ruins of ancient Ma'on. The site is mentioned as one of the cities of Judah, and hometown of Nabal the Carmelite. \"The wilderness of Maon\" appears in the Bible as a place of refuge for David when he fled from king Saul. Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael says that Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai is said to have gone up to Maon of Judah.\nFollowing the destruction of the Second Temple, Maon is referenced when Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai is said to have traveled there. In the early 4th century CE, Eusebius' ''Onomasticon'' mentions Maon as being \"in the tribe of Judah; in the east of Daroma.\" During this period, Darom (or Daroma) referred to the southern Hebron Hills, which retained a Jewish population living alongside a newer Christian one.\nThe archaeological site has been inhabited for a long time, with evidence found from the Early Bronze Age and up to Late Antiquity. People living there during the Israelite period left behind potsherds with Hebrew inscriptions. In the 6th century, a Jewish population built the Ma'on synagogue. The lack of remains from the late 7th-early 8th century suggests the village was abandoned during that time.\nSee also\nHorvat Maon \u2013 an archaeological site with the remains of ancient Maon, situated immediately south of the built area\nMa'on, Mount Hebron \u2013 a nearby Israeli settlement\nMakhamra family \u2013 one of the clans living in Ma'in\n",
    "Public engineering school in Senegal\nThe \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure polytechnique de Dakar (ESP), also known as the Higher Polytechnic School of Dakar, is a professional training institution under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education of Senegal. It was founded in May 1964. It is affiliated with Cheikh Anta Diop University (UCAD) in Dakar but has legal personality and financial autonomy. ESP Dakar is one of the most significant engineering schools in Senegal and West Africa. It trains senior technicians and engineers in the fields of science, technology, and management.\nESP comprises six departments (computer engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, chemical engineering, and applied biology) as well as a department of management science and various research laboratories.\nHistory\nSince its inception, the Higher Polytechnic School of Dakar has been a center of excellence for training students from Senegal, the sub-region, and beyond.\nThe Polytechnic Institute (IP), founded in May 1964, became the University Institute of Technology (IUT) in November 1967. On 30 April 1973, law 73-17 and decree 73-387 were enacted, making the IUT a public institution with legal personality and financial autonomy within the University of Dakar.\nIn the 1973\u20131974 academic year, the National School of Public Works and Buildings (ENTPB), which trained technical agents for the Ministry of Equipment, was integrated into the IUT's civil engineering department. In the same year, other reforms allowed the IUT to offer courses in business and administration.\nThese additional programs led to the awarding of the Technologist Engineer Diploma (DIT) and the Higher Diploma in Business and Administration Studies (DESCAE). In 1974, the IUT became the National Higher University School of Technology (ENSUT).\nOn 24 November 1994, law No. 94-78 transformed it into the Higher Polytechnic School (ESP) with two centers: Dakar and Thi\u00e8s. It included ENSUT, the \u00c9cole polytechnique de Thi\u00e8s (EPT), and the industrial section of the Normal School of Technical and Professional Education (ENSETP). At the same time, it separated from its tertiary division, which became the Higher Institute of Management (ISG) and was affiliated with the Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences (FASEG).\nENSETP was reconstituted in 2005, reclaiming its industrial part that was within ESP. The former Management Department of the former ENSUT, now the Higher Institute of Management affiliated with FASEG, returned to ESP in 2006.\nIn 2007, the former Thi\u00e8s Center of the Higher Polytechnic School (formerly EPT) became the \u00c9cole polytechnique de Thi\u00e8s, affiliated with the University of Thi\u00e8s and later directly with the Ministry of Higher Education.\nSee also\nEducation portalSenegal portal\nEducation in Senegal\n",
    "1341 siege in Denmark\nThe Siege of Kolding (Danish: Belejringen af Kolding) also known as the Siege of Koldinghus, was a siege by Jutish rebels on the Holsteinian-held Castle of Koldinghus in 1341. The siege ended unsuccessful, and Count Henry II of Holstein-Rendsburg retaliated by raiding much of Jutland.\nBackground\nIn 1340, a group of 50 Jutes, led by Niels Ebbesen, a minor nobleman, launched a surprise attack on Count Gerhard III,  who was regent of Denmark at that time, in Randers, resulting in his assassination. This event sent shockwaves throughout the country and in the aftermath, Ebbesen and his followers fled south across the Guden\u00e5 River, continuing their rebellion further south.\nSeal of Henry II (1317 \u2013 1382, called Iron Henry), Count of Holstein-Rendsburg and Duke of Schleswig. The seal dates from around 1343.\nEbbesen and his men now launched an assault on a Holsteinian fortification near present-day Skjern River, killing many Germans. Next, they set their sights on the strategically important Skanderborg Castle and besieged the place. However, the besieged Germans got reinforcements and confronted the Danes in open battle. The battle resulted in the death of Niels Ebbesen, however, the revolt did not seem to have ended as a result of the battle.\nSiege\nThe year after the battle, the Jutish rebels had gone, with great power, towards Koldinghus, which they would try to conquer. However, Count Henry of Holstein-Rendsburg (nickname Iron Henry), who had inherited his father's uncontrollable fighting spirit and warrior skill, came to the fortification's rescue, just like he did with Skanderborg. In the following confrontation, the Jutish rebels retreated from Koldinghus, and the Count would retaliate against the Jutes by raiding much of their controlled area. As a result, Henry gathered a big booty and left again to his base at Funen.\nAftermath\nThe explanation for Henry's far-reaching raids lies in his area of control: Henry and the Germans had control over Funen, which meant they could both raid west in Jutland and east on Zealand.\nSee also\nSiege of Kolding (1368\u20131369)\u00a0\u2013 Siege in Denmark, 1369\nNiels Ebbesen\u00a0\u2013 Danish folk hero\nSiege of Skanderborg\u00a0\u2013 1340 siege in Denmark\nGerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg\u00a0\u2013 Count of Holstein-Rendsburg\nBattle of Nonnebjerg\u00a0\u2013 1340 battle in Denmark\n",

    "Welsh Liberal Democrats frontbench team (1999\u20132000)\nMike German, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrat Group in the National Assembly for Wales, formed his frontbench team of party spokespeople on 13 May 1999. German had led his party into the 1999 National Assembly for Wales election after being elected as leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrat Group in 1998. This was his first frontbench team in the assembly, with it dissolving after the party entered government in October 2000. He formed a second frontbench team after his party returned to opposition in May 2003.\nGerman's first frontbench served through the resignation of First Secretary Alun Michael and the fall of his Labour administration. German negotiated a coalition deal with Michael's successor Rhodri Morgan in the months following his ascension to the premiership. After gaining the approval of their respective parties, German's Liberal Democrats formed a coalition government with Morgan's Labour Party, with German becoming the first deputy first minister of Wales. The coalition government was dissolved by Morgan after Labour made gains in the 2003 National Assembly for Wales election, with German's party returning to opposition and German forming a new frontbench team in May.\nHistory\nGerman formed his frontbench team of party spokespeople on 13 May 1998, on the same day as Rod Richards's Welsh Conservatives. All six assembly members (AMs) from the Welsh Liberal Democrat Group were given frontbench roles, including German's' leadership rival Christine Humphreys, who became the group's spokesperson for education and training. German appointed himself as the group's spokesperson for economic development and European affairs. Other appointments included Jenny Randerson as its chief whip and spokesperson for education and childcare, Kirsty Williams as spokesperson for health and social services, Peter Black as spokesperson for environment, local government and planning, and Mick Bates as spokesperson for agriculture and rural economy.\nOn the formation of his frontbench team, German criticised Alun Michael's decision to appoint two education secretaries to his cabinet, stating that the division of responsibility for pre-16 and post-16 education policy between two different ministerial posts was \"ridiculous\", and that instead \"we should be looking to provide education and training from cradle to work to retirement\". From October to February 2000, Michael's administration faced a political crisis which resulted in his resignation after the opposition parties, including the Liberal Democrats, worked together to pass a motion of no confidence in his premiership. Rhodri Morgan was elected unopposed to succeed him as Labour leader and he was nominated by the assembly as the new first secretary shortly afterwards.\nIn the months that followed Morgan's ascension to the premiership, German engaged in negotiations with him to form a coalition between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. After the coalition was approved by their respective parties, a new coalition government between the parties was formed on 16 October 2000, with German becoming the first deputy first minister of Wales under Morgan, whose office was renamed to first minister. The Liberal Democrats left opposition and remained in government until May 2003, when Morgan ended the coalition after his party made gains in the 2003 National Assembly for Wales election.

He was the founder of La Fabrique\u00a0.\nBiography\nBorn in Paris on 23 July 1936, Hazan's mother was a Romanian Jew originally from Palestine, while his father, Fernand Hazan, was a Jew originally from Egypt and the brother of editor and librarian \u00c9mile Hazan\u00a0. During World War II, his family took refuge in Marseille. After the war, his father founded the publishing house \u00c9ditions Hazan\u00a0. Hazan attended the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand and joined communist activists, as well as the National Liberation Front during the Algerian War. He became a cardiovascular surgeon and campaigned for abortion rights in France. In 1975, as a founder of the Association France-Palestine Solidarit\u00e9\u00a0, he travelled to Lebanon during the civil war to work as a combat doctor. He was a member of the Russel Tribunal on Palestine, which began work on 4 March 2009.\nIn 1983, Hazan gave up surgery and became director of the family publishing business, \u00c9ditions Hazan. However, he left management after the publisher was acquired by Groupe Hachette. In 1998, he founded the publishing house La Fabrique (\"The Factory\"), where the works published were primarily left-wing and historical or philosophical. He allegedly only published works by his friends according to Lib\u00e9ration, which included the authors Norman Finkelstein and Houria Bouteldja. The Coming Insurrection, published, written by The Invisible Committee and published by La Fabrique was denounced by Minister of the Interior Mich\u00e8le Alliot-Marie and led to Hazan's testimony in the Tarnac affair\u00a0. He also wrote and translated more than twenty works, including those of Edward Said.\n\u00c9ric Hazan died in Paris on 6 June 2024, at the age of 87. Jacques Ranci\u00e8re wrote a tribute to him in Liberation, published in English in the New Left Review.\nPublications\nBooks\nL'Invention de Paris, il n'y a pas de pas perdus (2002)\nChronique de la guerre civile (2004)\nFaire mouvement (2005)\nLQR\u00a0: la propagande du quotidien (2006)\nNotes sur l\u2019occupation\u00a0: Naplouse, Kalkilyia, H\u00e9bron (2006)\nChangement de propri\u00e9taire, la guerre civile continue (2007)\nL'Antis\u00e9mitisme partout.

    "Bruneian rice dish\nNasi Katok is a dish originating from Brunei Darussalam. At its core, Nasi Katok is traditionally composed of steamed rice, ayam goreng (fried chicken) and a spicy sambal dipping sauce, often presented as individual servings wrapped in brown paper or contained within boxes.\nWhile the fundamental components of Nasi Katok remain consistent, its preparation methods and ingredient choices for both the protein and sambal can vary significantly among vendors and eateries. This variation adds to the richness and diversity of the dish, allowing for a range of flavors and textures to cater to different preferences and tastes.\nAvailability\nFound throughout Brunei, the dish is readily available from roadside stalls to well-established restaurants and convenience stores. Its unprecedented popularity surged in the late 2000s, propelled by the emergence of franchises and 24-hour dining establishments specialising in the dish. This culinary trend also solidified its status as Brunei's indigenous fast food equivalent.\nToday, several noteworthy chains have emerged in Brunei, each dedicated to serving the local specialty with their own recipe, interpretations and styles. Among these establishments are Nasi Katok Kaka, Nasi Katok Mama, Nasi Katok Lily and Nasi Katok Nailis. This dish's widespread presence in diverse dining venues highlights its cultural importance and enduring popularity within Bruneian gastronomy.\nAdditionally, Nasi katok can also be found in cities and towns across East Malaysia that share robust socioeconomic connections with Brunei. These include Miri, Limbang, Lawas, Labuan, Sipitang, Papar and Kota Kinabalu. Reflecting the cultural exchange and cross-border influences, variations of this dish are offered in these regions, reinforcing its appeal beyond national borders.\nHistory\nThe dish derives its name from the Bruneian Malay terminology denoting rice (\"nasi\") and the action of knocking (\"katok\"). This nomenclature finds its origins in the historical practice wherein patrons would audibly signal their presence by knocking on the doors of rice vendors to initiate their orders. Evolving over time, this colloquial name has become emblematic of one of Brunei's quintessential culinary offerings.\nAccording to popular accounts, the origins of Nasi Katok can be traced back to the 1980s when a Chinese family embarked on a modest venture in their residence at the Low San Flat, situated within the Mabohai area. Specializing in Nasi Pusu, a dish featuring anchovy-sambal rice, they gradually garnered immense popularity among locals, serving customers until late at night. This early endeavor is frequently regarded as the embryonic stage from which the concept of Nasi Katok emerged, laying the groundwork for what would eventually morphed into the first informal Nasi Katok establishment.\nEvery patron who visited the family's home would personally knock on the door to purchase their food. The practice perhaps reflects an era when doorbells were not commonplace, making knocking the customary method for patrons to announce their presence and request to purchase rice. This traditional method of placing orders, where customers would personally announce their arrival, added to the distinctive and intimate dining experience of that time. The legacy of Nasi Katok Mabohai, recognised as the pioneering Nasi Katok venue in Brunei, endures as it remains open and operational to this day.\nCharacteristics\nTraditional\nThe preparation of Nasi Katok's fried chicken encompasses a multitude of approaches, each contributing to its unique flavor profile. One method involves coating the chicken in flour for enhanced crispiness. Alternatively, the recipe may call for infusing the chicken with turmeric, adding a vibrant color and aromatic essence, enhancing both its flavor and depth.\nFurthermore, some versions prefer to marinate the chicken with an assortment of spices. This infusion of flavors results in a more nuanced and complex taste experience, further enriching the overall dish. These diverse preparation methods provide consumers with a selection of options, each offering its own distinct characteristics and nuances, thus enhancing the culinary experience of Nasi Katok.\nContemporary innovations\nIn recent times, Nasi Katok has witnessed a surge in innovative adaptations, particularly in its sauce and protein offerings. Vendors have enthusiastically delved into culinary experimentation, introducing an extensive array of sambal options. From the traditional spicy chili sambal to the creamy and tangy buttermilk sauce, alongside milder tomato-based options, these diverse sambal and gravy choices cater to a broad spectrum of tastes and preferences among consumers.\nMoreover, the selection of proteins has transcended the conventional fried chicken, with vendors introducing enticing alternatives such as beef rendang, grilled lamb, seafood like mussels or lobsters and even vegetarian options such as fried tofu or tempeh.

    "American businessman and politician\nThis article is about an American businessman and politician Talbot H. Green. For the town in United Kingdom, see Talbot Green.\nTalbot H. Green (born Paul Geddes, August 11, 1810 - July 2, 1889), was an American merchant and politician during the mid-19th century, who was exposed as Paul Geddes, an absconder of funds from a Philadelphia bank. Born in Pennsylvania to an influential family of Scotch descent, Geddes initially worked in merchandising and engineering. His early career in Philadelphia ended abruptly after financial mismanagement and embezzlement led him to leave his wife and children, flee westward, and adopt the alias Talbot H. Green.\nIn 1841, Green joined the Bartleson-Bidwell Party, a pioneering group of emigrants heading to California. Known for his friendly demeanor and leadership skills, he quickly established himself in the Californian business community. Green worked closely with Thomas O. Larkin, a prominent merchant in Monterey, and became a key figure in Larkin's mercantile operations.\nGreen's influence extended beyond business; he played an active role in California's early political and social life. He was a founding member of the Society of California Pioneers, served on San Francisco's first city council, and participated in significant land transactions. His contributions during the U.S. military conquest of California included supplying goods to American forces.\nIn 1851, rumors of Green's true identity as Paul Geddes surfaced, leading to his departure from California. He relocated to Texas and later worked as a clerk for the secretary of the United States Senate. Green spent his final years in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where he lived quietly until his death in 1889, respected by his community but marked by his earlier life's misdeeds.\nEarly life and career\nPaul Geddes was born on August 11, 1810. The Geddes family, of Scotch origin, traces its descent from Paul Geddes, born in Scotland between 1660 and 1670. Paul Geddes resided for a time in Ireland, near Randallstown, County Antrim, where his son James was born in 1704. James Geddes, his wife Margaret Muir, and their three sons, Paul, William, and Samuel, emigrated to America in August 1752, settling in what is now Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. James' sons became prominent locally, with at least one active in the American Revolution. Samuel Geddes, the youngest son, died in 1788, leaving four children. His second child, James Gedde (1781\u20131867), was the father of Paul Geddes, later known as Talbot H. Green. James Geddes married his cousin, Mary Geddes (1781\u20131874), on February 12, 1807, and lived in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where he was known for his character and integrity, serving as treasurer of a corporation for over forty years. He and his wife were Presbyterians and raised their three children, Paul, Margaret, and James, in this faith.\nPaul left school early to work in a store for four years and later worked as an assistant engineer on the canal for two years. His father then provided him with $3,000 to start a merchandising business. They eventually bought another store in a neighboring town. On February 21, 1832, Paul Geddes was married to Henrietta Fredrick. After their marriage, Paul Geddes and his wife moved to a neighboring town where they established a new branch store. In this town, Geddes took on another business partner and was known as a respected and trusted businessman.\nEmbezzlement\nIn the spring of 1840, Paul Geddes traveled to Philadelphia to buy goods and had a large quantity of wheat consigned to a house there. He withdrew $3,000 on account of the wheat but lost the money after a night of drinking. That afternoon, the cashier of the Farmers & Merchants Bank of Philadelphia asked him to carry $105,000 to the Northumberland bank. Green committed a fraud and stole the money. There is no official record of the exact amount of money Green stole. The incident was described by Green himself in his letter to Thomas O. Larkin:\n...They got a carpet bag and put up 105,000$ in it in my presence and sent a porter with me to the hotel. I put it in my trunk and went out. On my return I found that I had been robbed of my money. I was under the excitement of liquor (no excuse) and was, in fact, not myself. I opened the carpet bag and took out nearly 8000$ and done the parcel up again. I then went to bed. In the morning  I then took the carpet bag to a merchant and told him what it contained and wished him to keep it until next day. The next day I went and paid a good many of my debts with the money and sent some 3000$ to my partner to pay notes we owed in the bank; and that night I left Philadelphia with 375$ determined that my people should never hear of me again. I went West and fell in with the emigration for California... \nPaul Geddes left Pennsylvania, abandoning his wife and four children. He traveled to New Orleans by ship from New York City. From New Orleans, he continued his journe",
    "Offshore solar refers to the installation of solar panels on bodies of water in the ocean, ports, bays, or estuaries. Offshore solar installations take two main forms, floating offshore solar and fixed-bottom offshore solar. Floating solar systems support solar panels on floating platforms moored to the seafloor; fixed-bottom solar systems support the panels on a rigid structure resting on the ocean floor.  \nOffshore solar is an emerging alternative to land-based solar power deployments that provides new options for powering coastal communities and facilities with clean energy, especially in large coastal cities and island communities where land availability is severely constrained. This market has accumulated growing interest from major industry stakeholders, namely the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that offshore solar had 40x more energy potential than offshore wind (85 TW vs. 2TW).  Offshore solar also has promising levelized cost of energy (LCOE) potential with floating solar estimated at $54/MWh ($50 Euro/MWh). \nHistory\nFloating Solar has been actively deployed since 2007, when it was first installed in Aichi, Japan, in 2007 by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. Detailed Floating Solar history can be found on the Floating Solar Wikipedia page. Fixed-bottom solar is at an earlier stage of development with an installation planned in the Bohai Sea in China  and other models at the concept phase (i.e. RCAM Technologies\u2019 Solar Reef).\nBenefits\nOffshore solar applications (both floating and fixed-bottom) share a few key benefits:\nAvoidance of Land-Use Conflicts: Offshore or near-shore solar installations can sidestep land-use conflicts, freeing up land for other purposes such as agriculture or development. Offshore solar is a new option for siting near the largest land-load centers such as large cities and ports.   \nCooling Advantage: Solar panels located near bodies of water can experience a cooling effect, which can increase their efficiency and output by 5\u201330% compared to land-based systems.  \nAdvantageous Integration with Offshore Wind: Offshore solar can be integrated with existing or planned offshore wind developments to increase energy production, reduce storage needs by 70% and cut the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). When deployed together, offshore solar & offshore wind can also share infrastructure, maintenance deployments and supply chain paths, further reducing costs.  \nThese advantages make offshore or floating solar an appealing option for renewable energy generation, particularly in regions where land availability is limited or where there are concerns about land-use conflicts. However, it's also important to consider the challenges associated with floating and fixed-bottom offshore solar systems.\nChallenges of floating offshore solar vs. fixed-bottom offshore solar\nA major distinction between these two types of offshore solar are their current levels of technology readiness. Floating offshore solar has 10+ current deployments across Asia and Europe, whereas fixed-bottom solar is a newly emerging concept. Although floating solar has had a longer history, the potential of fixed-bottom offshore solar can be extrapolated from the overriding success of fixed-bottom offshore wind compared to floating offshore wind \u2013 this is the guiding principle for its development.\nFixed-bottom structures are easier to install and lack the complications of mooring lines and anchoring. Floating solar arrays can have up to 24x the number of mooring lines as floating offshore wind (10 lines per MW vs 0.4 lines per MW). The biggest concern with this number is mooring line entanglements where large marine mammals can become tangled up in mooring lines or flotsam caught in the mooring lines, resulting in skin abrasions and sometimes drowning.  Floating solar is also vulnerable to damage from storms, hurricanes, and ocean disturbances.   A key advantage of fixed-bottom offshore solar is its ability to withstand tropical storms, including hurricanes.\nFixed-bottom solar has additional benefits that can be included in the design of its base structure. Historically, fixed bottom structures have functioned as an artificial reef for local wildlife (e.g. offshore oil rigs) which are sometimes left in place and converted into artificial reefs called Rigs-to-Reefs  \nWhile floating solar can be installed in much deeper waters due to its flexible mooring and anchoring systems, fixed-bottom structures face challenges due to their large and heavy design, necessitating the use of heavy-lift installation vessels.\nConcepts\nThere are currently about 10 concepts for offshore solar concepts and they are notably all floating concepts in their demonstration stage.\n",

He won a gold medal in the men's double sculls at the 2021 European Rowing Under-23s Championships and has been selected to compete for Great Britain in the men's quadruple sculls at the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nBiography\nBorn and raised in Tower Hamlets, Dixon has severe dyslexia which means he can only read about 25 words.\nAfter a short stint in mainstream education, he was home-schooled alongside his three siblings and has no GCSE or A-Level qualifications, although, with help from his mother, he achieved a psychology degree from the Open University.\nFrom a young age he took part in a variety of sports including tennis, climbing and swimming but found his main passion was sailing.\nDixon joined the British sailing team in 2016 competing in the Finn class and progressed through the age-group categories to compete on the World Cup circuit, but when it was dropped from the Olympic programme he decided to change sports to pursue his ambition of being an Olympian.\nAt the suggestion of Olympic sailing champion Giles Scott, whose brother Nick was British Rowing head of performance at the time, Dixon turned his hand to rowing.\nHe made it onto the British rowing squad, winning a gold medal at the 2021 European Rowing Under-23s in Poland in the men's double sculls with Nathan Hull.\nDixon made his Rowing World Cup debut in 2022 and was in the men's quadruple sculls boat which finished fourth at the 2023 European Rowing Championships in Slovenia, and the 2023 World Rowing Championships in Serbia although the disappointment on missing out on a medal at the latter was tempered by the fact their performance was good enough to gain qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nIt was fourth again for Dixon and his men's quadruple sculls teammates at the 2024 European Rowing Championships in Hungary.\nIn June 2024, Dixon was named in the Great Britain rowing team for that year's Summer Olympics in Paris as part of the men's quadruple sculls squad.\n",
    "(1895\u20131982) violinist and philanthropist\nAlice Ivy Wigmore became Alice Ivy Hay and Alice Ivy Paterson (9 January 1895 \u2013 21 August 1982) was an Australian violinist, writer and philanthropist. She abandoned years of training to marry. She later took to writing, including a book addressed to her grandson. She made major bequests to educational institutions including the Royal College of Music and the Wigmore Music Library at the University of Western Australia.\nLife\nWigmore was born in 1895 in Mildura. Her parents were Alice Elizabeth (born Wallis) and Herbert John Wigmore. Her father was a businessperson and her mother was skilled pianist. When she was twelve years old she went to study at the Royal College of Music in London accompanied by her mother who had been her first teacher. She was one of only three students invited to London for two years and her stay was extended for another two years and then again. She learned piano, violin and at her request, voice. She passed her final exams but the outbreak of war prevented her from staging her musical debut. Her journey back was made via India and Ceylon where she met Walter Edward Moncrieff Paterson of Tilliefoure.\nShe decided to abandon her music ambitions and marry Paterson. They had a daughter Lorna. Lorna later married Orde Wingate. Wingate rose to a Major General who created the unconventional fighting force known as \"The Chindits\". Orde Wingate was an outstanding soldier who died young in 1944 and six weeks before the birth of his son and her grandson, Orde Jonathan Wingate.\nHer second husband was Major Malcolm Vivian Hay of Seaton. They married in 1956 and he died in 1962.  The year before she had written her first book, Under the Eiderdown: The diary of a dachshund. Wigmore used the name \"Alice Ivy Hay\" to write a biography of Orde Wingate, her son-in-law titled \"There was a Man of Genius\u00a0: Letters to my Grandson Orde Jonathan Wingate\" which was published in 1963. Her grandson, Lt Col Orde Jonathan Wingate became a regimental colonel.\nLegacy and death\nAfter she became a widow for the second time she gave substantial gifts to educational institutions. The Royal College of Music received money to fund performers from the Ivy Wigmore-Hay award.\nWigmore gave thousands of pounds to the University of Western Australia after meeting Sir Frank Callaway. She gave him money that enabled him to purchase music for a music library and to fund the building of the Wigmore Music Library in memory of her mother. That music library \"The Wigmore\" is said to be the finest in Australia. In Aberdeen she gave money that enable the Malcolm Hay Memorial Lecture to be made each year and to fund work to counter anti-semitism. Wigmore died in 1982 in Aberdeen and she was buried in St Machar's Cathedral where the Hay family have a vault.\nThe purpose-built library at the University of Western Australia she had funded was \"repurposed\" as a studio which inherited the Wigmore name.\n",

    "\nEvents in 1884 in animation.\nEvents\nMarch: Appointment of a commission by the University of Pennsylvania,  including the University's professors William Pepper, Joseph Leidy, George Frederick Barker, Lewis M. Haupt and emeritus Harrison Allen, as well as Thomas Eakins and Edward Hornor Coates of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. They would work  with the photographer Eadweard Muybridge in a scientific study focused on the analysis of animal and human movement. The project would eventually last more than three years, and costs rose to almost $30,000, but the University believed the unexpected amount of time and money to be well spent. The huge body of work was thought to be of everlasting importance to science and art and it would take years to examine all the material critically. The study was based on Muybridge's previous work on chronophotography and the zo\u00f6praxiscope (animal action viewer). \nMarch 28: Opening of the amusement center Eden Mus\u00e9e in New York City. It featured a changing selection of specialty entertainment, including magic lantern shows and marionettes. The magic lantern was not only a direct ancestor of the motion picture projector as a means for visual storytelling, but it could itself be used to project moving images. Some suggestion of movement could be achieved by alternating between pictures of different phases of a motion, but most magic lantern \"animations\" used two glass slides projected together \u2014 one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that could be set in motion by hand or by a simple mechanism.:\u200a689\u2013699\u200a\nSince Spring 1884: From Spring 1884 to Autumn 1885, Eadweard Muybridge and his team produced over 100,000 images, mostly at an outdoor studio on the grounds of the University of Pennsylvania's northeast corner of 36th and Pine, recording the motions of animals from the veterinary hospital, and from humans: University professors, students, athletes, Blockley Almshouse patients, and local residents. Thomas Eakins worked with him briefly, although the painter preferred working with multiple exposures on a single negative, whereas Muybridge preferred capturing motion through the use of multiple cameras. Since 1879, Muybridge was working on the zo\u00f6praxiscope (animal action viewer), a projection device that created cyclical animations of animal movement, incorporating technologies from photography, the magic lantern and the zoetrope. The photographer created painted sequences on the glass zo\u00f6praxiscope discs that were based on his motion-study photographs to produce an early form of animation. Muybridge used these to illustrate his lectures that were presented to audiences in the U.S. and Europe, marking his contribution to photography and film in relation to the \"experience of time within modernity.\"\nBirths\nMay\nMay 20: Leon Schlesinger, American film producer (Warner Bros.

    "Peruvian martial art\nBakom, also known as Vac\u00f3n, is a Peruvian martial art created during the early 1980s by former commando and street fighter Roberto Le\u00f3n Puch Bezada.\nHistory\nThe art was created by Roberto Puch (b.\u20091952 in Martinete), a resident of the third block of Caylloma street, in the historic centre of Lima, a once-dangerous part of the city. The oldest of eight children, Puch was born in Barrios Altos, growing up in the neighbourhood's then crime-ridden areas, such as Cinco esquinas, where he saw kicking duels as a child, eventually learning self-defence techniques from a Chinese mentor at the city's Chinatown. A troubled relationship with his father (d.\u20092015) due to his behaviour led him to be sent to a boarding school. He eventually graduated from the COEDE School of the Peruvian Army, serving as a commando and later working as a member of the intelligence service.\nBoth the fighting style and its creator's fame reached its peak during the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 1990s, he was interviewed by Jaime Bayly in his programme \u00bfQu\u00e9 hay de nuevo?, also being featured in the biographical miniseries Tat\u00e1n\u00a0. After his appearances on Peruvian television, he became a bodyguard for a number of celebrities and politicians, eventually becoming a curandero, opening a workshop on Moquegua street.\nRules\nAccording to Puch, the ruleset is as follows:\nStudy the opponent and analyse the type of physical build.\nMaintain serenity, reason, make your mind work quickly and safely, keep your body elastic and not rigid.\nAlways remember that skill is better than strength and resort to creole mischief, that is, \"total fight.\"\nReview and memorize the weak points of the human body.\nDistrust is part of wisdom, in the face of a possible triumph; Never turn your back on your opponent. Never neglect any angle of your body.\nSurprise is the cornerstone of success in action; Change and combine different tactics in the fight.\nNever give your opponent a break, on the contrary, ensure his defeat by attacking him without rest.\nSee also\nList of martial arts\n",
    "Former lifeboat station in County Louth, Ireland\nGiles Quay Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, located in the village of Gyles' Quay, on the Cooley Peninsula in County Louth, Ireland. \nIt is one of two stations, the other being at Blackrock, that have been home to the Dundalk lifeboat, which was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1879.\nThe Giles Quay Lifeboat Station was closed in 1912.\nHistory\nEven before there was a lifeboat at Giles Quay, medals were awarded by the RNLI for \ngallantry. On 6 April 1858, the barque Mary Stoddart was seen in distress in Dundalk Bay. Numerous attempts were made over 5 days to rescue the crew. Finally, H.M. Coastguard Chief Boatman Robert Shankey and his boat crew set out from Giles Quay and rescued seven men on the 9 April. On the 10 April, they rescued the remaining survivors, although a further seven crew of the Mary Stoddart had been lost. No fewer than 10 RNLI Silver Medals were awarded for the numerous attempts made to save the crew. Shankey was awarded not one, but two silver medals (silver medal plus second service clasp) for his efforts on two days.\nIn 1877, it was thought that the Dundalk lifeboat would be better sited at Giles Quay (now Gyles Quay), on the north side of Dundalk Bay, rather than at the existing lifeboat station at Blackrock, on the south side. An quote of \u00a3205 for the construction of a new boathouse from a Mr. Matthews was accepted by the RNLI, and the 32-foot self-righting 'pulling and sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with oars and sails, Stockport Sunday Schools, was transferred over to the new station at Giles Quay in 1879. Blackrock lifeboat station was closed.\nThe first rescue was on 9 February 1880. The Giles Quay lifeboat launched to the brigantine Andover of Dublin, on voyage from Limerick to Liverpool, and stranded 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) from Dundalk Lighthouse. After taking off six people, the lifeboat went out again the following day, assisting with the refloat. Coxswain (and Pilot) Thomas Gallagher then took charge of the vessel, and arranged a tug to get the vessel to harbour.\nThe decision of relocating the lifeboat was already under review, and even as soon as 1880, it was decided to reopen the Blackrock station, but also to retain the Giles Quay station.\nA new boat, the 34-foot James Thomas, was delivered to Greenore on 25 August 1880, and then onwards to Giles Quay. The Stockport Sunday Schools lifeboat was returned to Blackrock, but not before a lifeboat race was held between the two crews, the Blackrock crew emerging victors after a restarted race.\nJames Thomas was launched to the brigantine Jean Anderson of Dundalk on 18 November 1882, bound from Ardrossan, and driven ashore on the east side of Dundalk Bar. The lifeboat stood by for four hours until the crew decided to abandon ship, and six men were rescued.\nA third boat would be provided to Giles Quay in 1891. This was the Providence (ON 310), a 34-foot 10-oared lifeboat, with sliding keel and water ballast tanks, provided from the legacy of the late Charles Pooley of Cheltenham. \nThe Providence was launched to the aid of the schooner Violet of Castletown, Isle of Man, aground on the North Bull. As the ship broke up, the crew of four managed to get to the North Bull beacon, and were rescued from there. It was said that All the ducks in Europe arrived to feed on the lost cargo of barley.\nThere were only two calls for the Giles Quay lifeboat after 1899, and in 1912, the Giles Quay Lifeboat Station was closed. The lifeboat had been called just 12 times in 33 years, but had rescued 19 people. The Providence would serve at Howth for a further year, before being sold from service.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Giles Quay\nRNLI Silver Medal\nRobert Shankey, Chief Boatman, H.M.

He was the maternal grandfather of Felix Yusupov.\nBiography\nPortrait of Prince Nikolai, aged 12, by Christina Robertson\nBorn 24 October 1827 to Boris Nikolaevich and Zinaida Ivanovna Yusupova, born Naryshkina. His grandfather, who he was named after, wrote: \"The wife of my son, Princess Zinaida Ivanovna, has been safely delivered in Saint Petersburg of their son, my grandson, Prince Nikolai Borisovich.\" He was christened on 13 November at the Saint Nicholas Naval Cathedral, with Emperor Nicholas I and his paternal grandmother as godparents.\nArt and music were both important subjects of his education. His father, Prince Boris wrote: \"Other than me and your mother, who care only for your happiness, may your first friends be your violin and your paintbrush. These will not betray you.\"\nYusupov was a skilled violinist. He was tutored by the Belgian violinist Henri Vieuxtemps (1820\u20131881), composed pieces for the piano and violin and authored several books on the subject of music. He was an honorary member of the Roman Academy of Music, the Philharmonic Academy of Bologna and the Paris Conservatory.\nIn 1849, his father died and at age twenty-two Nikolai Yusupov inherited the entire Yusupov fortune. The year after, he graduated from Saint Petersburg State University, Faculty of Law and was admitted to His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery as a secretary. He was banished to the Caucasus in 1852 for trying to elope with his half-cousin, Princess Tatiana Ribopierre.\nIn June 1856 he was back in favour and created Master of Ceremony at Emperor Alexander II's coronation. That same year, Nikolai married Tatiana. The marriage was originally deemed illegal, because of the bride and groom being too closely related according to Russian law, but the union was legalised by order of Alexander II. The pair had two daughters, Zinaida (1861) and Tatiana (1866) and a son in 1863, who died at three months old.\nFrom 1862 to 1868, Yusupov was a manager of the Public Library of Saint Petersburg. He used his position to research his family history, the results of which he published in his 1866 and 1867 essays. The Yusupov family spent most of its time abroad to improve Princess Tatiana's failing health. Nevertheless, she died in 1879 aged only 51. Nine years later, his daughter of the same name died from typhoid. Knowing the Yusupov line would die with him in the male line, Yusupov filed a request to bequeath his land, surname and title to his son-in-law, Count Felix Elston, husband of his only surviving child Zinaida. On 15 October 1884, the request was approved by the Government Senate, on the condition that the transfer would only occur after Prince Nikolai's death.\nYusupov died from a heart attack in Baden-Baden on July 31, 1891, aged 63. He was survived by his mother, daughter and two grandsons. He was buried at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra monastery.\nCharity\nPrince Yusupov was involved with charities from childhood. His father once wrote to him: \"My dear friend, always be a noble person, and fulfil your religious duties. Be a person whose behaviour and acts can lead to nothing but good, and you will be your parents' comfort and pride.\"\nIn memory of his father, Yusupov sponsored two scholarships for Russian literature and Russian history while studying at the Saint Petersburg State University. During the Crimean War, in 1854, Yusupov personally financed two infantry battalions. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878), he paid for a hospital train to treat wounded soldiers. Prince Yusupov was a trustee of the Alexander Marinsky School for the Deaf from 1881 onwards, and an honorary member of both the Demidov House of Charity and the Red Cross. He was the primary guardian of the Organisation of Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna's Charities.\nPublished Essays\nLuthomonographie historique et raisonn\u00e9e (Brussels, 1856);\nLa Question du Jour en Russie e'clairee par des faits historiques par LPNJ (Berlin, 1861);\nHistoire de la Musique en Russie...

It is the first basketball shoe created by the company and comes in a high top and low top model.\nOverview\nThe current 480 shoe line is actually a merger of two different shoe models, the New Balance Pride 480 and New Balance BB680. The Pride 480 is the first ever basketball shoe created by New Balance in 1983 and was released as a high top. A different model that was created as a low top version known as the BB680 was later released. Despite technically being different models, they are the same shoe just in different top heights. This is similar to the Pride 650 (high top) and P550 Oxford (low top) being the same shoe (now known as the New Balance 550).\nAt this point, the company was mainly known for creating running shoes and it wanted to expand into other sports. Seeing the popularity of basketball, it decided to enter the market by developing a basketball shoe. The shoe was developed to have better traction on the court and good breathability in the toe box. The shoe proved successful for the company and led to them creating more models for the sport.\nIn 2010, New Balance released a special model that was made to withstand a winter environment and cold climate. The shoe was only released in a high top and used the BB680 name. The shoe featured a more rugged upper and sole to protect from the weather and included metal eyelets and boot laces.\nAfter the success of the 550 reintroduction in 2020, New Balance decided to relaunch the 480 as a lifestyle shoe in 2021. New Balance partnered with Junya Watanabe to produce a special colorway of the shoe which was soon followed by general releases.\nModels\nNumeric 480\nThe New Balance Numeric 480 in a brown and dark green colorway.\nThe Numeric 480 is a skateboard variant of the shoe released in 2023. It features a thicker sole and more padding in the tongue. It comes in both low tops and high tops.\nIn popular culture\nThe Jumpman logo for the Air Jordan brand was actually based on a photo Michael Jordan had done for the Life Magazine. In the picture, Michael Jordan could be seen wearing the New Balance 480 shoes while in the air.\n",
    "Babylonian priestess\nNot to be confused with the nad\u012btu scribe Amat-Mamu.\nAmat-Mamu was a Babylonian nad\u012btu priestess in Sippar from the 18th century BC who was the subject of legal proceedings involving her inheritance. Amat-Mamu was chosen as the heir of fellow nad\u012btu Belessunu, who bequeathed Amat-Mamu with her land and slaves. In exchange, Amat-Mamu was to provide for Belessunu until her death. The estate was claimed by two of Belessunu's cousins, but the mayor ruled in favor of Belessunu and Amat-Mamu. Amat-Mamu then lost the deeds when they were kept in her uncle's home, requiring her to have them reconstituted in a new tablet. This tablet was preserved, and its description of Amat-Mamu's inheritance provides insight into Babylonian inheritance practices.\nFamily and inheritance\nA depiction of Shamash on the Tablet of Shamash\nAmat-Mamu was a nad\u012btu, a priestess to the god Shamash. She was the daughter of Sin-ilum (also transcribed as S\u00een-ilum or Sin-ili). Sin-ilum was the son of Sin-tajj\u0101r, who in turn was the son of Ak\u0161\u0101ja. Amat-Mamu had a cousin, an aunt, and a great aunt who were all nad\u012btus as well. Nad\u012btus were sometimes allowed to choose their own heirs, including potential heirs outside of their own families. Such an option was allowed to the nad\u012btu Belessunu, daughter of Mannium, as part of the terms of her own adoption as the heir of her aunt Naramtum, and Belessunu adopted Amat-Mamu as her heir.\nAmat-Mamu inherited four fields totaling forty-six acres: a five-acre field and a twenty-acre field in the Pzur-Ilaba district, a nine-acre field in the Akbarum district, and a twelve-acre field in the Pahu\u015fu district. She also inherited two plots of land: one and one-third sar of partially developed land in the cloister and six sar of undeveloped land of Sippar-rabum. Amat-Mamu inherited three slaves from Belessunu: Ana-pani-\u0160ama\u0161-nadi, Sin-ma\u0161ma\u0161, and Sin-ma\u0161ma\u0161's brother. Also inherited were a house, two copper pots, and two axes. Amat-Mamu was given the deeds, or \"mother tablets\", entitling her to Belessunu's property.\nPer the terms of the agreement, Amat-Mamu was required to pay Belessunu's debts and provide for her while she lived. The debt totaled two-thirds mina, six shekels of silver. To provide for Belessunu, Amat-Mamu was required to provide Belessunu with six gurs of grain, twelve minas of wool, twenty-four liters of oil, six feasts, twenty liters of flour, and two pieces of meat each year. The agreement specified that this agreement was only with Amat-Mamu, and no other person could lay claim to Belessunu's estate by providing for her.\nTwo years after the agreement was made, two of Belessunu's cousins and fellow nad\u012btus\u2014Amat-\u0160ama\u0161 and N\u012b\u0161i-\u012bn\u012b\u0161u\u2014laid claim to the fields. The mayor of Sippar, Zimri-Erah, ruled that the inheritance was rightfully Belessunu's. The cousins were penalized for making a false claim over property, and they were forced to give Amat-Mamu a tablet that relinquished their claims. Professor Rivkah Harris speculated that Belessunu passed over her cousins in favor of Amat-Mamu because Amat-Mamu was a member of a wealthy family and therefore better able to support Belessunu during her life.\nReconstitution of the tablets\nThe cuneiform tablets confirming Amat-Mamu's inheritance were stored in the home of her uncle, Ikun-p\u012b-S\u00een. They were kept separate from the family archive so as not to suggest that the inheritance was part of the family estate. It is unknown why they were kept in her uncle's house, though such storage arrangements with family members were not uncommon.\nWhen they were lost, her father S\u00een-il\u00ee had a deposition taken from the uncle admitting to their loss. Amat-Mamu was forced to go to the court so the judges could authorize the creation of new tablets. The tablets that Belessunu received as a girl during her own adoption were not reconstituted, for she and her witnesses to that contract had already died. The court also ruled that should the previous tablets be found, they were still the sole property of Amat-Mamu.\nThe sequence of events describing both the legal dispute and the tablets' loss was documented on the reconstituted tablet. The reconstitution meant that some details were lost and inconsistencies were introduced, primarily in the description of the fields. The tablet is dated to the 14th year of Samsu-iluna's rule, placing its creation in 1736 BC. It has been preserved and is designated by archeologists as CT 47.63. Amat-Mamu's story is listed on the tablet alongside that of Belessunu, including Belessunu's dedication as a nad\u012btu and her adoption by her aunt. The tablet is used in the modern era as a reference to understand Babylonian property and inheritance law.\nNotes\n^ a b c Charpin 2010, p.\u00a063.\n^ a b c Harris 1969, p.\u00a0138.\n^ Harris 1969, p.\u00a0137.\n^ De Graef 2016, pp.\u00a0280\u2013282.\n^ a b c Charpin 2010, p.\u00a064.\n^ a b c De Graef 2016, p.\u00a0281.\n^ Charpin 2023, pp.\u00a0117\u2013118.\n^ a b Charpin 2023, p.\u00a0118.\n^ a b c d Jacquet 2013, p.\u00a077.\n^ a b Charpin 2010, pp",
    "Finnish member of the Lapua movement\nArvo Kalevi Heikkinen (May 25, 1911 \u2013 December 1, 1940) was a Finnish member of the Lapua movement, known for his involvement in the murder of Yrj\u00f6 Holm, a municipal councilor from Forssa, in 1930. Later, he fought in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the fascists led by General Francisco Franco. The detective who interrogated Heikki regarding Holm's murder characterized him as an \"ideological fanatic\".\nMurder of Yrj\u00f6 Holm\nHeikkinen, born in Kestil\u00e4, Finland, returned home from his military conscription as a sergeant. He then worked as a business assistant until he started studying at Evo Forestry College. In the summer of 1930, he became interested in the extreme right-wing Lapua movement and began to lead its strike group operating in Loimaa. The group committed commit three kidnappings. One of these, the attempted kidnapping of Yrj\u00f6 Holm, a former member of the Loimaa town council then living in Forssa, on the night of July 3\u20134, resulted in the killing of the target. Rather than submitting to the kidnappers, Holm defended himself and was eventually being killed in the resulting exchange of fire.\nFollowing the death of Holm, the authorities first suspected Paavo Markkula of having shot Holm. After Markkula was arrested, Heikkinen organized a demonstration by 800 supporters of the Lapua movement in Forssa on November 4 to get him released. After Markkula's release, both Heikkinen and Enso Kivikoski, a student, were suspected of having shot Holm, but in the end no one was convicted of the murder. However, in 1931, Heikkinen received a nine-month suspended sentence from the Court of Appeal in Turku for three counts of false imprisonment. Following his sentence, Heikkinen worked as an advertisement seller for the newspaper published by the Lapua movement and the IKL youth organization Blue-and-Blacks, until he became unemployed after the organization was disbanded in 1936.\nSpanish Civil War\nIn early 1937, Heikkinen decided to join the Spanish Foreign Legion to fight in the ranks of the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War that had broken out in July 1936. In February, he traveled with a group of ten Finns on the S/S Wappu steamship from Kotka to Hamburg, where the men contacted the head of Nazi Germany's propaganda department, Heinrich Hoffmann. This led them to the talks of a Spanish recruiter who arranged a trip via Lisbon to Spain. Olavi Karpalo, who later fought in the SS forces of Nazi Germany, joined the Spanish Foreign Legion with Heikkinen.\nHeikkinen fought on the Madrid front under the pseudonym \"Arbo Kalbi\". In April, Heikkinen was wounded by a grenade fragment that hit his head, and transferred to the military hospital in Palencia, where he wrote about his war experiences in IKL's Ajan Suunta magazine under the pen name \"H\". Heikkinen was soon transferred to Ceuta from where he continued to write for various magazines of IKL, this time under the pen name \"KH\" and later also reported under his own name for Ilta-Sanomat.\nReturn\nIn September 1937, Heikkinen returned to Finland together with the journalist Veikko E. Rutanen. In November, he got a job as the editor of IKL's Lakeus newspaper published in Sein\u00e4joki.\nIn March 1938, Heikkinen started as a prison guard at Helsinki County Prison, but he was arrested after only a month in connection with the murder of Yrj\u00f6 Holm. Even in the new trial, the murder charge could not be proven, but Heikkinen received another five-month sentence for false imprisonment. He died of the injuries obtained in Spain in December 1940, aged 29.\n",
    "\nThe 1983 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat was a palace revolt in Guatemala by the officer corps, led by then Defense Minister General \u00d3scar Humberto Mej\u00eda V\u00edctores, which successfully ousted General R\u00edos Montt. Mej\u00eda V\u00edctores governed the country for three years until international pressure forced him to make democratic reforms. By 1986, power was relinquished to the democratically elected Vinicio Cerezo.\nCoup attempt\nDue to his alienation of the ruling elite \u2013 wealthy landowners, army officers, and conservative politicians \u2013 through his erratic behavior and religious zeal to a fundamentalist Protestant sect in a predominantly Catholic country, R\u00edos Montt's downfall was largely anticipated. Other contributing factors included his refusal to schedule elections and his governance which led to human rights abuses and a declining economy.\nThus, amidst widespread discontent over his electoral programs, the officer corps led by Defense Minister General \u00d3scar Humberto Mej\u00eda V\u00edctores staged a palace coup against General R\u00edos Montt on August 8, 1983. The resulting clashes between government and rebel forces left at least one dead along with several wounded. Suspicions of foreign involvement were raised when it was revealed Mej\u00eda V\u00edctores met with the Southern Command of the US military the day before the coup, leading to accusations the United States sponsored the military overthrow. In response, the State Department denied any and all involvement.\nPost-coup\nFollowing the successful coup, General R\u00edos Montt was forced into retirement and General Mej\u00eda V\u00edctores was sworn in as the new chief of state. The inauguration ceremony was attended by key military officials and former cabinet members of the deposed administration. Mej\u00eda V\u00edctores, who had not assumed the title of President and continued on as Minister of Defense and Chief of State, pledged to call for elections, suspend the military tribunals, lift the state of alarm which had been in effect since June 29, 1983, and respect the judiciary and constitution. His promises however were seen as merely superficial gestures to placate international observers.\nThe coup was viewed by some as largely insignificant in terms of substantial change, representing merely another reshuffling between the military who had controlled Guatemala for decades. This was supported by the fact Mej\u00eda V\u00edctores was part of the same military elite  resistant to change, as evidenced by his hostility towards US officials regarding human rights violations.\nNevertheless, Mej\u00eda V\u00edctores kept his promises and lifted the state of alarm, abolished the Courts of Special Jurisdiction, dissolved the Council of state, and ensured due process and judicial integrity by broadening individual guarantees. He also promulgated a new amnesty law for political crimes. However, the brutal tactics that characterized the previous regime persisted under his reign, with a reported 90\u2013100 political killings per month in 1984.\nEventually, the government made democratic reforms to attract foreign aid, leading to elections being held in 1984 for the Constitutional Assembly, which was tasked with drafting a new constitution. The new drafted constitution was adopted the following year on May 31, 1985. General elections were held on November 3 which resulted in Vinicio Cerezo being victorious. On January 14, 1986, Cerezo was inaugurated as president.\n",
    "Military unit\nThe 125th United States Colored Infantry Regiment, (USCI) part of the United States Colored Troops (USCT), was an African-American unit formed during the final months of the American Civil War. Organized in Louisville, Kentucky, between February 12 and June 2, 1865, the regiment was the last of its type to be formed, thus not participating in active combat during the war itself. The regiment performed garrison and guard duties, initially around Louisville then in New Mexico. It was officially disbanded and paid off in Louisville on December 20, 1867, the last of the USCT units to be mustered out.\nHistory\nDuring the Civil War, calls for African-American troops by President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass led to some 23,703 African Americans in the State of Kentucky enlisting into the Union Army, forming a variety of units, including the 125th USCI regiment. Mustered in Louisville, Kentucky, the unit was under the command of Colonel Charles D. Armstrong from 1865 until 1866, with Colonel William R. Gerhart succeeding him afterwards, leading the regiment until its disbandment in 1867.\nAfter the Civil War ended, the 125th USCI regiment continued serving the Union, performing garrison duties in Louisville. In 1866, eight companies of the regiment were ordered to New Mexico Territory to replace white volunteer troops leaving service and protect settlers and travelers in the Rio Grande River region from potential bandit and Indian attacks. The unit, consisting of about 26 officers and 610 men, traveled by steamboat to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, then marched along the Santa Fe Trail afterwards. They finally arrived in New Mexico by August 1866. During the journey, some soldiers mutinied in St. Louis upon learning of their destination, and a few deserted.\nDuring service in New Mexico, the regiment was stationed at various forts, including Fort Bayard, which they founded on August 21, 1866; Fort Selden, where they were the first African-American troops to occupy the fort; and Fort Bliss in Texas. The unit continued its duties until October 1867, after which they were sent to Fort Riley, Kansas, to be mustered out. The regiment was officially disbanded and paid off in Louisville on December 20, 1867.\nSee also\nList of United States Colored Troops Civil War units\nLouisville in the American Civil War\n",
    "\nPKS 1144-379 also known as PKS B1144-379, is a quasar located in the constellation of Centaurus. At the redshift of 1.048, the object is located nearly 8 billion light-years from Earth.\nCharacteristics\nPKS 1144-379 is classified as a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ), brighter than S4.8\u00a0GHz=65 mJy. It has an active galactic nucleus with high optical polarization. As monitored at 13\u00a0cm and 6\u00a0cm by researchers over three years, which they found it as a star-like object, PKS 1144-379 has been identified as BL lac object of Mv \u224816.2, due to its variability in optical, infrared, and radio wavelengths. Such BL Lac objects like PKS 1144-379 are rare active galactic nuclei class, characterized by all frequencies, and absence of emission lines.\nPKS 1144-379 is also radio variable as observed in the Parkes 2700 MHz survey by researchers working at Parkes Observatory. The quasar is dominated by its bright compact radio core, but according to maps that is made with a high dynamic range, it shows an extended structure. PKS 1144-379 also has a luminosity above both FR I/FR II limit ~ 1032 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 at 5\u00a0GHz and such also classfied as a blazar, a type of active galaxy that is producing radiation, observed at wavelengths from radio to gamma rays.\nObservation of PKS 1144-379\nPKS 1144-379 is known to be variable for its long and short-term flux density variability at centimeter wavelengths. Some of the first observations of PKS 1144\u2212379 showed variability at frequencies of 5 GHz. The flux density is shown to increase from 0.9 Jy to 1.6 Jy between December 1970 and February, 1971. In September of the same year, it had increased again to 2.22 Jy. Between May and August 1994, the flux density of PKS 1144\u2212379 at 4.8GHz dropped by 17%, and subsequently 9% at 8.6\u00a0GHz.\nIn June 1996, PKS 1144-379 underwent optical variation again. Over the next 2.5 days, the survey data shows the quasar had a 33% change at 4.8 GHz. Subsequent data showed more variations in PKS 1144\u2013379 with maximum of 8.6\u00a0GHz with over three hours of irregular change of 20%. This is strongly correlated with 10% change at 4.8\u00a0GHz. From the results studying the variability behavior of PKS 1144\u2013379, researchers found the optical variation is 1.92 mag. This is smaller than those, ~ 3.5 mag in its infrared region.\nUsing the Ceduna 30-m radio telescope at a frequency of 6.7\u00a0GHz and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data at 8.6\u00a0GHz at the University of Tasmania in Australia, researchers investigated the evolution of PKS 1144\u2013379. They found the variability time-scales associated with two flares detected  in PKS 1144-379 between November 2005 and August 2008 were found to derive from long-term variations in total flux density as monitored by Ceduna between 2003 and 2011. Moreover, a kinematic study of the parsec-scale jet of PKS 1144-379 was also performed through VLBI data obtained between 1997 and 2018, which they observe quasi-periodic flarings of ~3-4 yr. Over the 20-yr interval, they found the average jet position angle was ~150\u00b0. The core component of PKS 1144-379 is found to be compacted, which its angular size varied between the ranges of 5.65-15.90 \u0427as estimating to be 0.05-0.13 pc.\nResearchers assumed the variations observed in PKS 1144\u2013379, are due to scintillation. The variations are 6.2 \u00d71012 K at 4.9\u00a0GHz with approximately 10% of total flux density found in the scintillating component. Given the results, PKS 1144-379 has a high modulation index in the range of 5\u201318% combined with the 1.2 day characteristic timescale (corresponding to a peak-to-peak period of 7.7 days), making it the most extreme bright scintillators identified in history.\nAccording to observations by Fermi, PKS 1144-379 has a column dissipation radius of 64.5 x 1015 cm (430) RS with an accretion disc luminosity of 1045 erg s\u22121 3 x (0.04) LEdd. The jet power as the form of radiation for the quasar has a log probability of 44.92 log Pr with Poynting flux of 44.49 log PB while the bulk motion of electrons and protons is found to be have 44.34 log Pe and 46.41 log Pp. From the results, PKS 1144-379 has an estimated black hole mass of 108\u2013109 M\u2299, whom researchers noted.\n",
    "Established in 2022, the \"Marrakech Platform\" aims to enhance regional cooperation in counter-terrorism through the exchange of information, expertise, and coordination of efforts among African countries. It serves as an important dialogue forum for addressing common challenges and developing effective strategies to combat terrorism and extremism. This international cooperative initiative seeks to strengthen regional efforts to combat terrorism in Africa. Jointly supervised by Morocco and the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, the platform aims to provide a comprehensive and coordinated response to the growing and complex terrorist threats on the African continent.\nSignificance of the Marrakech Platform\nAfrica is a priority for the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism. Vladimir Voronkov, the Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, has emphasized Morocco's significant support for the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism through the high-level meeting of heads of counter-terrorism and security agencies in Africa.

    "Swiss physician and naturalist (1685-1769)\nMoritz Anton Cappeller\nMoritz Anton Cappeller (German: Moritz Anton Kappeler, June 9, 1685 \u2013 September 16, 1769), also known as Mauritius Antonius de Cappeller, was a Swiss physician and naturalist. His last name is also written in Anglicized forms as Capeller or Cappeler.\nLife and career\nCappeller was born in Willisau in 1685 and grew up in the city of Lucerne. After finishing Latin school, he graduated from the Jesuit College in Lucerne. From 1700 to 1704, he studied mathematics and philosophy at the Collegium Helveticum in Milan. He completed his medical studies at the Lorraine Academy (later University of Lorraine) in Pont-\u00e0-Mousson in 1706. During the War of the Spanish Succession, he served as a doctor and engineer in Naples. In addition to his work in the imperial service, he also had time for scientific observations. He climbed Mount Vesuvius twice and lay down on the edge of the crater. He later published his observations under the title: Curieuse Relation von dem feuerspeuchtenden Berg Vesuvio. He turned down an offer of a professorship in Naples.\nFront page of Pilatii montis historia by Cappeller\nAt his father's request, Cappeller returned to Lucerne in 1710, where he took over his father's medical practice. From 1712 to 1754 he was the town doctor in Lucerne. From 1717 on, he was a member of the Lucerne Grand Council. In addition to his bread-and-butter work as a doctor, he was repeatedly able to apply his knowledge as an engineer. For example, he accompanied the Lucerne troops in the Toggenburg War as an engineer. He was also a teacher of mathematics and geometry at the artillery school. He played a key role in correcting the white water of the Krienbach.\nHe became famous for his crystallographic and mineralogical work. His publication Prodromus cristallographiae caused an international sensation and earned him membership of the Royal Society of London. His main work, the history of the Mount Pilatus (Pilatii montis historia), which he worked on from 1723 to 1728, did not initially find a publisher. For the first time, Cappeller produced a map of the mountain using only two perspectives drawn from different viewpoints. His research activities were varied; his interests included rock science, botany, crystallography and surveying. He was also involved in a wide network of correspondents. He corresponded with Johann Jakob Scheuchzer, Albrecht von Haller, Abraham Gagnebin, Isaak Iselin, Josef Anton Felix Balthasar, the nuncio Domenico Silvio Passionei, but also with members of the Royal Society (including Hans Sloane, to whom he also sent some minerals).\nIn 1730, Cappeller was elected a member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina with the academic surname Archyta Tarentinus I. After the death of his wife, Cappeller moved to his son in Ruswil in 1754 and, when he became a canon, to Berom\u00fcnster. He died on September 19, 1769, and was buried in the cloister of the canons' monastery in Berom\u00fcnster.\n",
    "Business court of Wyoming\nThe Chancery Court of the State of Wyoming (the Wyoming Chancery Court) was created in 2019 as a specialized business court to provide a streamlined judicial forum for addressing commercial, business, and trust cases litigated in Wyoming's state courts, with a unique focus on digital assets and blockchain technology.\nHistory\nWyoming's legislature passed a statute in 2019 creating the Wyoming Chancery Court, which was signed into law the same year. Unlike a traditional chancery court, which is a court of equity, Wyoming's new chancery court was given jurisdiction over purely monetary disputes as well as actions in equity, with a limited subject matter jurisdiction focusing on disputes of a business and commercial nature. One early stated goal for the Chancey Court involves Wyoming seeing itself in a unique role involving cryptocurrency and blockchain technology: \"Coupled with Wyoming\u2019s innovative legal framework for digital assets and blockchain technologies, the Chancery Court should attract blockchain businesses and cryptocurrency companies to the state.\"\nThe court went live on December 1, 2021.\nDetails\nThe court has its own set of rules. Under Wyoming Rule of Civil Procedure for the Chancery Court 3(a), all parties to a case must agree to the Chancery Court's jurisdiction, so a single party may timely object to that jurisdiction and have the case dismissed from the Chancery Court. The Chancery Court does not have jury trials, and is to employ alternative dispute resolution, limited motion practice, and carefully monitored and tailored discovery in making sure cases are handled expeditiously and effectively.\nThe court can have up to three judges, and currently (as of June 2024) has two. These judges have concurrent statewide jurisdiction with Wyoming's district court (the trial court of general jurisdiction) judges over matters within the Chancery Court's jurisdiction.  Chancery Court judges receive the same salaries as district court judges. There is a separate clerk for the Chancery Court.\n",
    "Football club\nNAFI Stuttgart (stylized as N.A.F.I. Stuttgart) is a German futsal and football club from Stuttgart. The futsal team won the DFB-Futsal-Cup, the German futsal championship, once. As of September 2022, the club is currently not fielding any teams.\nHistory\nThe club originated from an amateur team that was founded around 2005. Five years later, the team joined the T\u00fcrk SC Stuttgart. After this club dissolved, the team continued to play as Hilalspor Stuttgart. In 2013, the club was renamed to NAFI Stuttgart. As the W\u00fcrttemberg Football Association believed that NAFI was a family name and therefore not allowed as a club name, periods were inserted between the letters. According to the club president, NAFI stands for Neuer Amateurfu\u00dfball international (Neuer international amateur football). However, the club's website states that the name derives from the sponsor Nafis Bakirci.\nFutsal\nUnder the name TSC Stuttgart, the team first qualified for the DFB-Futsal-Cup in 2008 and became German futsal vice champions after a 3:6 defeat in the final against UFC M\u00fcnster. After being eliminated prematurely in 2009, 2012 and 2013, the club won the German championship in 2014. After defeating Hamburg Panthers and UFC M\u00fcnster, the Stuttgart team reached the final again, where they beat Holzpfosten Schwerte 5:3. The following year, Schwerte took revenge with a 10:4 victory in the semifinals. For unknown reasons, Stuttgart did not participate in the newly introduced Regionalliga S\u00fcd in 2015 and instead played in the second division.\nFootball\nNAFI Stuttgart was also active in football. The first team was promoted to the Bezirksliga Stuttgart in 2015 and to the Landesliga in 2017. At the winter break of the 2018/19 season, NAFI was in second place in the Landesliga, but due to unpaid wages and internal disputes within the club, the team only finished eleventh in the table at the end of the season. For the 2019/20 season, the club did not register a team and was therefore placed last in the final Landesliga table of the 2018/19 season.\nHonours\nDFB-Futsal-Cup winner: 2014\n",
    "\nLegality of professional MMA competitions by country\nAfrica\nSouth Africa\nMMA competition is legal and under the purview of the Professional Mixed Martial Arts Council or PROMMA Africa, which was formed in 2010 with the main purpose to regulate MMA at larger MMA promotions such as EFC Worldwide (Formerly known as EFC Africa). PROMMA Africa began overseeing Rise of the Warrior MMA events in 2010. In 2012 the PROMMA Africa Council was accepted into the Mixed Martial Arts Association of South Africa (MASA) thus granting MMA \"national sport\" status. In addition to EFC Africa, there are other leagues such as Dragon Legends MMA.\nAmericas\nBrazil\nMain article: Mixed martial arts in Brazil\nJanuary 17, 2013, saw the announcement that the Brazilian MMA Athletic Commission, or Comissao Atletica Brasileira de MMA (CABMMA), had joined the International MMA Federation. The CABMMA represents state federations across Brazil and is spearheaded by lawyers Giovanni Biscardi and Rafael Favettia, a former Executive Secretary of the Minister of Justice and Interim Minister of Justice. The CABMMA supervised its first event with \"UFC on FX 7\" on January 19, 2013, at Ibirapuera Gymnasium in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nThe CABMMA first hit international sports headlines when it suspended fighter Rousimar Palhares for prolonging a submission on opponent Mike Pierce, despite him tapping several times, during UFC Fight Night 29 in Barueri, Brazil on October 9, 2013. The CABMMA was called to preside over another controversial situation involving a Brazilian competitor, when Vitor Belfort's use of Testosterone Replacement Therapy came to light over UFC on FX 8 (May 18, 2013)\nCanada\nMain article: Mixed martial arts in Canada\nFor many years, professional MMA competitions were illegal in Canada. Section 83(2) of the Canadian Criminal Code deemed that only boxing matches where only fists are used are considered legal. However most provinces regulated it by a provincial athletic commission (skirting S. 83(2) by classifying MMA as \"mixed boxing\"), such as the provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Northwest Territories. The legality of MMA in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, and New Brunswick varies depending on the municipality. Professional MMA competitions remain illegal in the Canadian provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Yukon, and Nunavut because it is not regulated by an athletic commission.\nCanada formally decriminalized mixed martial arts with a vote on Bill S-209 on June 5, 2013. The bill formally gives provinces the power to create athletic commissions to regulate and sanction professional mixed martial arts bouts. Bill S-209 does not in and of itself make MMA legal across Canada; it allows provinces to make it legal on a province by province basis.\nUnited States\nMain article: Mixed martial arts in the United States\nIn the United States, professional MMA is overseen by the Association of Boxing Commissions. According to the Associations of Boxing Commissions, professional MMA competitions are allowed in all states. Alaska has no boxing or athletic commission. Montana has a state athletic commission, although it does not regulate MMA. However, MMA is legal in both states. West Virginia became the 44th state to regulate mixed martial arts on March 24, 2011. On March 8, 2012, Wyoming became the 45th state to regulate MMA. On May 4, 2012, it was announced that Vermont had become the 46th state to regulate MMA. Legislation allowing MMA in Connecticut came into effect on October 1, 2013, making it the 47th state to regulate the sport. On March 22, 2016, the New York State Assembly voted to lift the State's 1997 ban on MMA and on April 14, 2016, Governor Cuomo signed the bill legalizing and regulating the sport into law.\nAsia\nCambodia\nIn January 2013, the Cambodian Mixed Martial Arts Association was created under the Cambodian Martial Arts Federation.\nAt this time there are no MMA events organized with the CMMAA approval. Television channel MYTV holds its KWC promotion under the sanctioning of the Cambodian Boxing Federation, responsible for sanctioning all boxing and Kun Khmer events in the country, in direct contrast to the situation in neighbouring Thailand.\nChina\nThe first professional mixed martial arts promotion was Art of War Fighting Championship which was founded by Andy Pi, a Chinese American BJJ practitioner. After defeating Xu Xiaodong in a televised MMA match he noticed the lack of formal rules, medical care or oversight which could have led to MMA and BJJ being banned in China so he came up with an idea to create a regulated professional MMA promotion. When setting up the promotion, Pi sought out grapplers to compete in it. He met Zhao Xuejun, a renowned Sanda coach who convinced Pi that he did not need to seek out pure grapplers and that Sanda fighters were just as capable of competing in MMA. Art of War I was held at the Beijing Sports University on November 6, 2005, making ",

    "This article is about the Fred Frith album. For the melodic section or entire piece of music written for guitar, see Guitar solo. For the Derek Bailey album, see Solo Guitar (Derek Bailey album).\n2024 studio album by Fred Frith\nGuitar Solos / Fifty is a 2024 solo double LP by English guitarist, composer and improviser Fred Frith. It was released on vinyl in Germany by Week-End Records to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the release of Frith's 1974 debut solo album, Guitar Solos. The first disc of the double album is a reissue of his original 1974 solo album remastered, and the second disc is a new solo album of 13 guitar tracks Frith recorded in 2023. Just as the original Guitar Solos was recorded without any overdubbing, Fifty also had no overdubs.\nBackground\nFrith recorded the original Guitar Solos in July 1974 while he was a member of English experimental rock group Henry Cow. The album has eight tracks of unaccompanied and improvised music played by Frith on prepared guitars without any overdubbing. Guitar Solos was well received by critics at the time, and resulted in two follow-up albums, Guitar Solos 2 (1976) and Guitar Solos 3 (1979), featuring additional tracks by Frith, plus several other improvising guitarists, including Derek Bailey and Hans Reichel.\nTo mark the upcoming fiftieth anniversary of Guitar Solos in 2024, Jan Lankisch of Week-End Records in Cologne, Germany suggested to Frith in 2023 that they reissue Guitar Solos as a double-LP with a second disc of new material. Frith began selecting unreleased recordings he had made over the previous fifty years, but Lankisch proposed that Frith record the new material. Frith liked the idea and decided to reproduce the same recording environment that was used in 1974 as much as possible. He used the same guitar he had used on the original album, the 1936 Gibson K-11, and created multiple sound sources from pickups on the guitar, and microphones positioned on his seat and around the room. Frith said they managed to reproduce the original studio environment quite closely, but noted that \"it became apparent that a lot of it was not really relevant anymore.\" Reflecting on the recording of Guitar Solos fifty years ago, Frith noted how \"na\u00efve\" he was at the time. He said he knew very little of the London improvisation scene, and had he known what other musicians were doing, \"I probably wouldn't have made the record!\"\nJust as no overdubbing was used on the original Guitar Solos, the new recordings for Fifty had no overdubs. Frith played his guitar held in the \"conventional position\" on all of Fifty's tracks, as was the case on all but one of the tracks on Guitar Solos \u2013 on \"No Birds\" he played two guitars flat on a table. Week-End Records released Guitar Solos / Fifty on vinyl in February 2024 in a limited edition of 1,000 copies. The double-LP's sleeves are illustrated with the photograph from the original 1974 album showing Frith playing a guitar on a cricket field in front of a sight screen, and a similarly posed photograph of Frith taken in 2023.\nReception\nIn a review of Guitar Solos / Fifty in The Wire, Clive Bell called the album \"a clever, confident record by an old master\". He described the newly recorded tracks on the second disc as varying between \"pretty and melodic\" and \"gritty or microtonal\". In contrast to Frith's loud \"rocky\" Fred Frith Trio, Bell said \"Fifty is surprisingly delicate and understated.\" Throughout the album, Bell wondered whether the multilayered sound was created with overdubbing, \"but of course there is none\". He stated that Frith \"foregrounds the physically of playing a guitar\", which \"is to be treasured\" in an era of effects pedals and synthesisers. Bell said Frith \"confronts his younger self and the sheer nerve of what he was attempting back then.\"\nJennifer Lucy Allan wrote in The Quietus that the music on Guitar Solos \"embraces texture and resonance\", and the repetitions, sounds and noise \"make me go fizzy\". She said that the way \"No Birds\" opens and closes \"is burned into my synapses\". Allan was pleased that on Fifty, \"Frith has ... not softened, nor suffered calcification, and the playing is as energetically nimble as ever.\" She added, \"The palette remains fresh; the creative insistence in the playing remains. Sonic ideas that might otherwise seep into the earth are caught and excavated\".\nReviewing the album in the Spanish music magazine, Rockdelux Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Lenin wrote that while Fifty was recorded using similar techniques and in a similar environment that was used for Guitar Solos, the new recordings do not have the same impact that the original album had. In the 1970s, listeners must have been \"astonished\" (at\u00f3nito) by what Frith had done, but today, free improvisation and \"radical avant-garde\" (vanguardias radicales) is quite common. Nevertheless, Lenin stated that there is still much to appreciate on Fifty \u2013 the music is more \"delicate\" (delicado), \"even beautiful\" (incluso bonito) and \"almost melodic\" (cas",
    "\nOtumfuo Educational Fund is a non-governmental organization established by His Royal Majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.\nThe organization is based in Kumasi, the administrative and traditional capital of the Ashanti Region and Ashanti Kingdom  respectively. It is a thematic area of the mother foundation; Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation. As the first to be established, the Eductional Fund had undertaken several initiatives in improving education in the Ashanti Kingdom and in Ghana as a whole. The organization had project like Information, Communication and Technology (I.C.T) Mobile Learning for Rural Basic School, Mass Distribution of textbooks, Otumfuo Community Reading Challenge, Teachers Awards  and Tertiary Scholarship Awards.\nCreation\nThe Otumfuo Educational Fund was established few months after his ascension to the golden stool in 1999. His Royal Majesty, with his vision to fight wars against poverty, illiteracy, injustice and underdevelopment in his Kingdom and in Ghana, decided to invest in education.  Having realized that financing education was a major challenge in his domain, the Asantehene instituted the scheme to complement government's efforts to address the problem.\nThe Educational Fund was launched on May 21, 2000, in London, United Kingdom with the aim of providing financial assistance to needy but brilliant student in the Ashanti.  It was to also provide incentive packages to teachers posted to the rural areas, re-equipping schools through the provision of furniture and rehabilitating school buildings in poor conditions.\nRev. Dr Osei Bonsu, the Catholic Bishop of Mampong, Ashanti who served as the first of the organization stated  beneficiaries of the fund was not to be only children with Ashanti parentage but also non-Ashantis whose parents live and work in the Ashanti region and those whose parents could traced their ancestry to Ashanti.\nA 10-member board of trustees were appointed to oversee the activities of the Education Fund. During the launch in London about 80 million Ghana Cedis was raised to support the fund.\nYears later, His Royal Majesty, expanded the organization to cover other thematic areas like Health, Water ans Sanitation, Culture and Heritage and Entrepreneurship. It led the way for the creation of the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation.\nSource of Funding\nThe Fund is by the Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II and his wife Lady Julia. The fund also receive support from external and internal organizations. Donations from individuals help support the fund as well.\n",
    "Mesopotamian religious ceremony\nT\u0101kultu was a type of religious ceremony in ancient Mesopotamia. It took the form of a ritual banquet during which a king offered drinks to deities. The oldest attestations have been identified in texts from Babylonia from the Old Babylonian period, though as early as during the reign of Shamshi-Adad I t\u0101kultu started to be performed in Upper Mesopotamia as well. Assyrian references are available from the Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian periods. During the reign of the Sargonid dynasty the goal of the ritual was to create a link between the center of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its peripheries by invoking deities from various locations to bless the king.\nName\nThe term t\u0101kultu is derived from the Akkadian verb ak\u0101lu, \"to eat\", and can be literally translated as \"banquet\" or \"festive meal\". The corresponding Sumerian term is gi\u0161bun, a possible loanword (from Akkadian kispum), logographically written as KI.KA\u0160.GAR (literally \"place where beer is put\"). The ceremony designated by it has accordingly been characterized as a type of food offering, a \"banquet ritual\". Neo-Assyrian sources indicate that it involved a king offering beverages to deities. William W. Hallo notes the development of the religious meaning of t\u0101kultu reflects a broader phenomenon of Mesopotamian cultic terms being derived from everyday language.\nEarly attestations\nBabylonia\nAccording to Stefan Maul is possible that t\u0101kultu developed from earlier rituals focused on Enlil. The oldest references to it have been identified in texts from Babylonia from the Old Babylonian period.\nWilliam W. Hallo suggested that the myth Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave describes a t\u0101kultu. In the relevant passage, Lugalbanda prepares a feast consisting of the meat of goats and aurochs and various alcoholic beverages, and invites An, Enlil, Enki and Ninhursag to partake in it. The term used to designate it is Sumerian gi\u0161bun, known from other sources to be a translation of t\u0101kultu.\nA single text from the Sealand refers to preparation of food for a t\u0101kultu, though Odette Boivin notes there is no evidence that a distinct festival is meant, and assumes the passage deals with nindab\u00fb, a well attested monthly food offering.\nOnly three attestations of the term t\u0101kultu have been identified in Middle Babylonian texts, and it is not clear if the religious ceremony or a regular banquet is meant in each of these cases.\nOther areas\nT\u0101kultu was also incorporated into the traditions of Upper Mesopotamia. It is already mentioned in an inscription of Shamshi-Adad I, which seemingly indicates it was held in Assur during his reign. The surviving copy (Louvre A 889) is a tablet discovered in the royal palace of Mari, though it is presumed that the formula was also inscribed on votive objects mentioned in it.\nReferences to t\u0101kultu held in Assur, specifically in the temple of Ashur, reappear in Middle Assyrian texts from the reigns of Adad-nirari I and his successor Shalmaneser I. Inscriptions on fragments of pots and jars indicate it was held at least three or four times during the reign of the former and at least three times during the reign of the latter.\nNeo-Assyrian attestations\nOverview\nNo attestations of t\u0101kultu are available from between the reign of Shalmaneser I and the ascent of the Sargonid dynasty to the throne of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Stefan Maul argues that it is nonetheless possible it continued to be performed through the rest of the Middle Assyrian period, and through the entire Neo-Assyrian period. Versions from the reigns of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal, A\u0161\u0161ur-etil-il\u0101ni and S\u00een-\u0161ar-i\u0161kun are known. Individual copies have been discovered during excavations in Assur, Nineveh and Sultantepe. While Maul states t\u0101kultu was presumably performed in Assur in the temple of Ashur, Beate Pongratz-Leisten notes that the geographic distribution of the texts might indicate the ritual was performed simultaneously in multiple cities, or alternatively more than once during the reign of a single ruler. Surviving colophons indicate the texts were prepared by high ranking courtiers, such as the astrologer Issar-\u0161umu-\u0113re\u0161\u00a0 and the exorcist Ki\u1e63ir-A\u0161\u0161ur, advisors of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal.\nPongratz-Leisten notes that the Neo-Assyrian t\u0101kultu texts do not focus on ritual consumption. However, the new form of the ritual added a distinct spatial dimension to it, with binding the peripheries of the Neo-Assyrian Empire to its center as a primary goal. Deities from various areas were invoked to bless the king, the city of Assur and Assyria as a whole.\nIn contrast with many other Neo-Assyrian ritual texts, surviving t\u0101kultu copies do not contain detailed performance instructions, save for the version from the reign of Sennacherib.\nInvoked deities\nMesopotamian deities\nNeo-Assyrian t\u0101kultu texts contain long lists of invoked deities. They are considered an important source of information about the pantheons of Assyrian cities, though John MacGinni",

It specializes in virtual reality media, and is using generative AI to develop a simuated reality titled the Simulation, and a streaming platform called Showrunner that can generate custom episodes.\nHistory\nWolves in the Walls'\nIn January 2018, Fable Studio launched, with Wolves in the Walls as its premiere VR title. The property was based on the Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean children's book of the same name. In August 2019, Wolves in the Walls won a Primetime Emmy for outstanding innovation in interactive media.\nThe Simulation and Showrunner\nIm May 2023, Fable Studio announced an AI project titled \"The Simulation\", which plans to create a simulated reality of AI-powered characters with the eventual goal of creating an artificial general intelligence. The Simulation's official website is entirely fabricated.\nIn July 2023 as part of The Simulation project, Fable Studio released a paper describing their tool named SHOW-1, also known as AI Showrunner, which uses a complex network of AI agents to create full animated TV episodes; they showcased the technology by creating several unauthorized episodes of South Park, inspired by an episode of that show about characters using ChatGPT. Saatchi described the potential to create a \"generative TV\" service where fans can create and share their own episodes, or to allow writers or directors to realize their own original projects. SHOW-1 was heavily criticized by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, who were on strike at the time over the risk of their careers getting automated. Film, TV, and comic-book writer Christos Gage described the SHOW-1\u2013generated episodes as \"soulless and unfunny\". Devin Coldewey of TechCrunch, in contrast, said of one of the episodes, \"Although I wouldn\u2019t say the episode is funny, it does have a beginning, a middle and an end, and distinct characters (including lots of fake celebrity cameos, including fake Meryl Streep).\"\nAccording to Fable Studio, Showrunner will allow users to create a custom episode given a plot, scene descriptions, and more specific elements like dialogue and shots.\nIn June 2024, Fable Studio announced a streaming service, also titled Showrunner, that will allow users to create and share their own episodes using AI in a similar format as the South Park demos.

    "\nAbd al-Karim Kashmiri (died 1784) was a Indo-Persian historian who wrote the Bayan-e vaqe, a Persian chronicle mostly focused on the life of the Afsharid shah (king) of Iran, Nader Shah (r.\u20091736\u20131747).\nBiography\nAbd al-Karim Kashmiri's early life is largely unknown. An Indo-Persian from Kashmir, Abd al-Karim Kashmiri was a resident of Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi) when the Iranian shah (king) Nader Shah (r.\u20091736\u20131747) of the Afsharid dynasty invaded the city in 1739. He started working for Nader Shah as a clerk and traveled with him back to Iran in order to make the pilgrimage to Mecca and see the tombs of Muslim saints. Following multiple expeditions in the Punjab, Sindh, Afghanistan, Khorasan, Transoxania, Khwarazm, and other regions, Nader Shah eventually arrived in the city of Qazvin in 1741. At that point, Abd al-Karim Kashmiri along with Nader Shah's physician Alavi Shirazi left travel to Mecca. He stopped at Aleppo, Karbala, and other locations along the route. After making the pilgrimage, he traveled by water from Jeddah to the port of Calcutta, arriving back in Delhi in 1743. He died in 1784.\nBayan-e vaqe\nIt was after his return to Delhi that Abd al-Karim Kashmiri started writing his Bayan-e vaqe, which mostly focused on the life of Nader Shah, but also mentions events during his travels. His work is based on his personal observations as well as previously published histories from figures such as the Iranian historian Hazin Lahiji, and oral accounts from people Abd al-Karim Kashmiri considered trustworthy, including Alavi Shirazi, Mirza Ali Akbar, and other members of Nader Shah's entourage. Numerous Persian manuscript copies in India, Iran, and Britain, as well as an English translation shortly after the text's publication, attest to the widespread circulation of the Bayan-e vaqe in both Persian and English language societies.\nAlthough not a poet, a Persian Hindustani like Abd al-Karim Kashmiri was exposed to the same literary collection of tropes and figures as Hazin, despite Persian literature being increasingly focused on a smaller selection of classical works considered essential or authoritative from the late 18th-century. Persian literary characters and figures\u2014from poets to heroes, monarchs, statesmen, mystics, and lovers\u2014appear in both of their works. Abd al-Karim Kashmiri illustrates his arguments with couplets from many poets, including Saadi Shirazi, Rumi, and Hafez, and with references to the Shahnameh and Khosrow and Shirin legends.\nAbd al-Karim Kashmiri and Hazin held many of the same opinions despite their differences. They both considered the invasion of their own kingdoms and cities to be tragedies. They both hold similar historical assessments, including a dislike and contempt for Nader Shah, a feeling of political disintegration in their own kingdoms, disaster in the surrounding areas, and an appreciation of Europeans.  Abd al-Karim Kashmiri and Hazin expressed similar cultural values and used historical comparisons to make ethical and recurring judgments about politics and culture, often emphasizing themes of loyalty and friendship. Because they shared a common Persian cultural tradition, they could use and adapt the same literary texts to reflect different or even opposing views on cultural values and historical interpretations.\n",
    "Soviet-American librarian and bibliographer\nZinaida Zhitomirskaya was a Soviet librarian, translator and bibliographer who researched German literature.\nBiography\nZinaida Zhitomirskaya was born in a Jewish family in Dnipro, modern-day Ukraine. In the 1920s, she moved to Moscow with her parents. She studied Germanic languages at the Moscow Institute for Philosophy, Literature and History which was later merged with the Moscow State University.\nIn the 1930s, Zhitomirskaya married Oleg Erastov who worked as a lecturer at the Moscow Planetarium. Soon after the birth of her only child, Konstantin Erastov, Zhitomirskaya moved to Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where her father worked as a microbiologist.\nAfter returning to Moscow in 1944, she started working at the All-Union Library for Foreign Literatures. Her work at the library included compiling bibliographic indexes and reference books on the works of German authors as well as the Russian translations of their books and critical responses to them. She has also translated a number of adventure books from English into Russian.\nIn 1978, she emigrated from the USSR to the United States with her son Konstantin.\nFamily\nZinaida's father Viktor Zhitomirsky, a native of Taganrog, was a son of the renowned Yiddish scholar and pedagogue Konstantin Israel Zhitomirsky. He studied medicine in Kharkiv and took part in the Russian Civil War as a military physician. Later, he became one of the first microbiologists in Tajikistan and helped prevent the spread of epidemics in the region during World War II. Zinaida was named after her late paternal grandmother, Konstantin's wife, Tzina Zhitomirskaya (n\u00e9e Vikteshmayer). The Zhitomirsky and Vikteshmayer families had been living in Taganrog for generations.\nZinaida's mother, Emilia Zhitomirskaya (n\u00e9e Minukhina), was born in Dnipro. Her father, Zelman Minukhin, was a merchant and a scholar at the Ohel Mattityahu synagogue. Emilia's maternal grandfather, Moisei Zlatkin, was a rabbi in Rostov-on-Don and father to the early Hebrew bibliographer Menahem Mendel Slatkine.\nPublications\nReference books\n\u0416\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0417. \u0412.

    "Historic district in New Jersey, United States\nUnited States historic place\nMontrose Park Historic District is a historic district located in South Orange, Essex County, New Jersey, United States. The buildings in the district were built between c.\u20091870 and c.\u20091930 and were added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 29, 1997.\nHistory\nMontrose Park is primarily a residential neighborhood, located in the northeast corner of the township of South Orange. The general geographic boundaries are the Morris and Essex Railroad on the west, the municipal boundary between the City of Orange and the Village of South Orange on the north, the municipal boundary with the City of Newark on the east, and South Orange Avenue on the south. The neighborhood is characterized by elegant, large-scale homes, dating from the last quarter of the 19th century into the 1930s. The houses are set on large, landscaped lots, outlined by bluestone sidewalks and curbs, framed by mature trees and shrubbery, and lit by gaslight.\nSeveral of the streets were originally developed by John Gorham Vose and Henry A. Page between 1867 and 1874 as part of a residential development called Montrose, intended  to attract wealthy New York businessmen to rural South Orange. After 1891, a number of other streets were developed by Thomas A. Kingman (as Montrose Park), who insisted that lots measure no less than 100 by 200.\nWithin the historic district, there are 900 contributing buildings (mostly single family dwellings), 229 noncontributing buildings, and 1 contributing site. Of the key buildings, two, the Old Stone House and Mountain Station, are already listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Except for two synagogues and one school, most of the primary buildings are residential.\nArchitectural styles\nMontrose Park contains a collection of Victorian and period revival architecture, dating from 1870 to 1930, with some earlier exceptions. The most commonly represented styles include the Colonial Revival, with Georgian, Adam and Dutch Colonial influences the most dominant, followed by the Shingle Style. The following styles are also represented, in descending order of frequency: Tudor Revival, Queen Anne, Italian Renaissance Revival, Italianate, French Second Empire, Mission, Romanesque Revival, French eclectic, medievalizing, Art Deco and Gothic Revival.\nExtant properties\nOld Stone House, at 219 South Orange Avenue, c.\u20091670 (rebuilt 1773).\nAbel Ward House, at 497 South Orange Avenue, 1785.\nBenjamin Baldwin House (also known as the House with the White Chimneys), at 311 Centre Street, 1804.\nKip-Riker House (known as \"Montrose\"), at 432 Scotland Road, designed by Henry Ives Cobb for Ira A.

    "Fictional character from Heavenly Delusion\nFictional character\nMaru (Japanese: \u30de\u30eb) is a fictional character and protagonist from Masakazu Ishiguro's manga series Heavenly Delusion. Maru is an orphan who was given a mission by a woman named Mikura to travel across Japan to find \"Heaven\" and find a person who possesses an identical face to hand over a cure. He is given the bodyguard Kiruko whom he is attracted to despite her claims that she is actually a boy who had his brain transplanted into his sister's body. Nevertheless, they develop a strong bond in their journey as they battle giant creatures they call either man-eaters or Hirukos with Maru possessing the talent to destroy them by making contact with their cores; Kiruko names it \"Maru Touch\" (\u30de\u30eb\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1). Maru's supernatural ability are also notable by his surprising fighting skills which are later revealed to be connected with his origins from Heaven; The Takahara Academy who used to experiment on teenagers.\nMaru was based on Kona, a character Ishiguro wrote in a previous work, And Yet the Town Moves, but wanted to reuse after seeing an interview Hirohiko Araki regarding his continuous works in the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Maru's relationship with Kiruko was inspired by buddy films and stories about siblings though Ishiguro suggested a more romantic idea since the series' beginning. In the anime adaptation, Maru is voiced by Gen Sat\u014d in Japanese and Jonathan Leon in English. The character was generally well received due to his adventures with Kiruko and the bond they share. Maru's origins were also the subject of mystery in regards to his similarities with fellow character Tokio and what is their possible connection.\nCreation\nWhile manga artist Masakazu Ishiguro started writing Heavenly Delusion in 2018, he first revealed a teaser in late 2017 featuring the designs of Maru and fellow character Tokio. The sibling-like dynamic of the duo of Maru and Miruko was based on Ishiguro's personal life. He was inspired by an event when he noticed a person who was interested in his sister. Another aspect of the protagonists' dynamic was inspired by buddy films. He has always been inspired by stories of brothers and sisters, so he wanted to create his own story about a brother and sister swapping places, where the brother takes care of the sister. He rejected coincidences related to magic and wanted to create a more realistic and accurate world to show what happens during a brain transplant. Another theme involves how relationships would change if somebody's sex changed. He often writes metaphorical situations with Kiruko's menstrual cycle being caused by clashing with Maru's lips when awakening from an hallucination from a Hiruko's attack.\nDespite Ishiguro's fascination with siblings, Maru and Kiruko are not blood relatives. Nevertheless, Ishiguro wanted to make Maru affectionally call Kiruko sister. While Maru is often protected by his bodyguard Kiruko, Ishiguro decided to give Maru a very high fighting ability to compensate for such weakness. This helped Ishiguro to keep writing Heavenly Delusion as a buddy film. Maru's design was inspired by Ishiguro's series Soremachi most specifically the character Kon. The style is different from before, and Ishiguro thought he would stop reusing characters this time. However, after reading Hirohiko Araki's comments about his character designs in the story arc Jojolion he decided to keep writing Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. This interview motivated Ishiguro to keep using the Kon designs in Maru's in a similar fashion as Jojolion. Another influence was the manga Akira by Katsuhiro Otomo who makes heavy emphasis on a post-apocalyptic world that Ishiguro wants to create in calm scenes involving Maru interacting with Kiruko while having meals. In the beginning, Maru has feelings for Kiruko without knowing that his bodyguard is a boy inside a girl's body. Ishiguro called this premise as \"transsexual sci-fi\", alluding to the possibility of Maru still loving Kiruko despite knowing the truth.\nFukami noted the constant banters between Kiruko and Maru important for the plot setting so they avoided trimming them. As for Maru, he thinks he is very pure and does not know anything yet. Mori finds him attractive for how he does not strangely rubbed and it is bright. The director got the impression that Maru meets Kiruko from a place where he does not know his own past, and gradually gains an ego. On the other hand, Kiruko is in a complicated situation with Maru, and has a past that is too heavy for her to handle alone. As a result, he enjoys the two and thinks it is a mutually complementary relationship. Maru's action sequences were animated by Tetsuya Takeuchi who wishes to match wuxia-like choreography with active camerawork. He was also assisted by Ryo Araki. Gen Sat\u014d, Maru's Japanese voice actor, found that while Maru expresses several emotions, not much about him is known so it got difficult for him to voice the character,\nRole in Heavenly ",
    "Species of flowering plants\nOurisia crosbyi is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. Leonard Cockayne described O. crosbyi in 1915. Plants of this species of New Zealand foxglove are showy, perennial, large-leaved, tufted, rhizomatous herbs that are hairy with non-glandular hairs. They have serrate, ovate, hairy leaves. The flowers are in whorls in each node, with a regular calyx, and a large, white irregular corolla. The corolla tube is yellow with three lines of yellow hairs inside. It is found in montane forests and is listed as Not Threatened.\nTaxonomy\nOurisia crosbyi Cockayne is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. Leonard Cockayne described O. crosbyi in 1915.\nThe type material was collected by Cockayne in Longwood Range, Southland, New Zealand. The lectotype was designated by Heidi Meudt and is housed at the Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research Allan Herbarium.\nOurisia crosbyi plants are large, showy, hairy perennials with whorls of flowers with large white corollas, characters they share with another New Zealand species, O. macrophylla.\nOurisia crosbyi is morphologically most similar to another large-leaved, showy, hairy perennial New Zealand species, O. macrophylla, which also has whorls of flowers with large white corollas and three lines of yellow hairs.\nA number of morphological differences also distinguish O. crosbyi from O. macrophylla, including its serrate or serrate-crenate leaves and bracts (vs. crenate), flowers that are not hairy on the outside (vs. hairy), and pedicels with non-glandular hairs only (vs. pedicels with glandular hairs).\nDescription\nOurisia crosbyi plants are large perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, with opposite leaves that are tightly tufted along the horizontal stem. Leaf petioles are 5.0\u2013145.0 mm long. Leaf blades are 14.2\u201372.5 mm long by 7.8\u201365.0 mm wide (length: width ratio 1.3\u20131.8: 1), usually narrowly ovate to ovate, widest below the middle, with an acute apex; usually truncate base; and serrate or serrate-crenate edges. Leaves are sparsely to densely hairy with non-glandular hairs on both sides. Inflorescences are erect, with usually glabrous racemes up to 49 cm long, and with 3\u20136 flowering nodes and up to 40 total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node has up to 12 flowers and 2\u201312 sessile and sometimes clasping bracts that are usually lanceolate to narrowly ovate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves,  13.6\u201345.1 mm long and 4.0\u201332.0 mm wide, and become smaller toward the apex of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a densely hairy pedicel that is up to 48.6 mm long and has non-glandular hairs only. The calyx is 4.2\u20137.8 mm long, regular, with all five lobes divided to the base, and with isolated to sparsely distributed hairs. The corolla is 14.5\u201319.9 mm long (including the 4.3\u201310.7 mm long corolla tube), bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous and white on the outside, and yellow and with three lines of yellow hairs on the inside. The corolla lobes are 4.3\u20139.9 mm long, spreading, and obcordate or obovate-spathulate.

It is found in montane southern beech forest below the bushline, in damp areas on the forest floor, or near streams or waterfalls, from 0 to 1050 m above sea level.\nPhylogeny\nOne individual of O. crosbyi was included in phylogenetic analyses of all species of the genus Ourisia using standard DNA sequencing markers (two nuclear ribosomal DNA markers and two chloroplast DNA regions) and morphological data. In all analyses, the sampled individual belonged to the highly supported New Zealand lineage, and in the nuclear ribosomal and combined datasets, it was closely related to other large-leaved species, especially O. macrophylla, O. vulcanica and O. calycina.\nIn another phylogenetic study using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), all 7 sampled individuals of O. crosbyi formed a highly supported clade that was in a larger clade of other large",
    "\nThe construction of the Brooklyn Bridge 1909.\nBridges construction is the creation of engineering structures that provide people and vehicles with unhindered transition or passage through natural and man-made obstacles: rivers, straits, channels, ravines, canyons, watercourses, valleys, other roads, for connecting similar transport systems into a single network.\nBridges are indispensable links of communication. They dramatically increase the ability to move people and goods. The appearance bridges and its associated infrastructure reduces poverty by increasing trade, revitalizing entrepreneurship and lowering prices for goods, as well as improving the living conditions of the population. Thanks to the construction of bridges, the population is served by ambulances, police, fire, rescue, repair and construction services. The developed bridges network allows the distribution of medical and educational services in previously inaccessible areas.\nThe history of bridge construction\nThe Mycenaean arched Arkadiko bridge (XIII century BC) is perhaps the oldest in the world.\nSeasonal bridge north of Jispa in Himachal Pradesh, India\nAlmost all ancient peoples who left behind any written records have words denoting a bridge. Archaeologists have discovered the remains of some stone bridges from the megalithic era, made in the form of vaulted arches.\nHowever, the very first bridges were tree trunks that accidentally fell across the stream, along which animals and hunters crossed from one bank to the other without, getting wet in the cold water. Then the people began to deliberately fell trees, peel the logs, lay them over the river and fasten them together.\nThen the ancient inventors guessed to connect logs floating on the surface of the water into big rafts from one shore of river before the other shore, forming a single floating bridge. Later, boats with tarred sides began to be used instead of logs.\nRyazhevy bridge over the Ken River.\nSince floating bridges soon get wet and sink, and are also destroyed by the rapid current of the river and ice drift, then for a more durable bridge, ancient people came up with the idea of lowering large log boxes (crib pier, log cabins) to the bottom of the river, filling them with stones, and connecting the adjacent tops of the supports protruding from under the water with long logs.\nWhere the spring flood annually wash away the loose banks and carry trees into the river, or where is timber rafting, the floating trees can get stuck between the bridge supports and block the powerful current of the river, which can destroy the bridge. Therefore, the distance between neighboring islands-bridge support has to be made longer than the length of the trees, but for longer spans it is necessary to build a complex strong load-bearing structure. To prevent the extended bridge span from breaking under the weight of pedestrians and transport, its girders are rely by struts or fastened to other logs, which form a single rigid frame with the girders or a spatial truss of the bridge span between adjacent supports.\nAncient craftsmen also adapted to drive wooden piles into the bottom of river, on the tops of which they then installed bridge spans. Since the depths of water barriers and the thickness of silt at the bottom can be quite large, ordinary logs for piles were built up by sequentially connecting several logs joint to joint using pipes and clamps. Piles under the bridge supports were immersed not in single ones, but in groups, the space inside of which was filled with stones, with the formation of a chain of islands across the river, pointed in form against the current of the river. In addition to the vertically driven piles, some piles were driven into the river bed at an angle, giving the entire bridge structure more rigidity.\nWhen an even longer span was required, high support towers began to be built along the edges of the bridge, between which strong chains or ropes (later steel cables) were stretched, on which the spans of suspension or cable-stayed bridges were then suspended. The first suspension bridges made of vines appeared in the jungle. People Khasi and Jantia in India even in the XXI century cultivate living root bridge from the aerial roots of Ficus elastica. In medieval European fortress castles, drawbridge often functioned above the moat in front of the only gate.\nPriorities in bridge construction\nIt is preferable to build a bridge in a place where there is the shortest distance between the opposite banks of a river, stream or gorge, which significantly simplifies the process of creating any bridge. To reduce the distance between the banks of a river and, consequently, the size of the bridge, in shallow waters across a river, strait or bay, a dam can be built, and a more expensive bridge span structure can be constructed only over the remaining relatively small deep section of the river fairway to ensure the flow of water and the passage of ships.\nTo resist the pressure of the",

She completed a BA in writing, Literature and Gender with a Jacob Burns Scholarship in May 1990. She received a scholarship from the Center for Cultural Studies and studied literature at Eugene Lang College of the New School for Social Research in New York. She received her master's degree from the University of California, Santa Cruz in Literature in 1995.\nShe clerked for Judge Betty Binns Fletcher at the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. She received her doctorate from the New York University School of Law magna cum laude.\nSatterthwaite is Professor of Clinical Law at New York University School of Law, where she heads the Global Justice Clinic. She became the faculty director of the Robert and Helen Bernstein Institute for Human Rights in 2015. She led the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice starting in 2006.\nIn 2013 she and Jayne C. Huckerby published their book, Gender, National Security and Counter-terrorism: Human Rights Perspectives. It includes work by a variety of authors and it includes a chapter by Satterthwaite on measuring the United States Agency for International Development's work to counter violent extremism.\nSpecial rapporteur\nIn October 2022 she was appointed as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers by the Human Rights Council. This is a position that has existed since 1994.\nIn September 2023 she had written in \"alarm\" to the President of Kirawati. He had ordered that the Australian judge David Lambourne who was married to the leader of the opposition should be deported. The pilot had refused to take him and the island's senior judges had all been suspended for refusing to enforce the President's will. This had left the country with no senior court of appeal or any legal check on the government's powers.\nIn April 2024 she received a long letter from Nagananda Kodituwakku who was a Sri Lankan lawyer and politician. He had been debarred from practicing law in 2019 following a dispute with a judge. He has asked Satterthwaite to intervene in the case which resulted in him being barred from practicing law.\nIn 2024 she spoke out against the plans of the United Kingdom to send immigrants to Rwanda while they apply for political asylum.  The government was passing laws to override the judiciary. The new law would command judges to decide that Rwanda was a \"safe country\" irrespective of any evidence that was brought to the court. She said that the governments changes to the law \"constitute an interference with the independence of the judiciary and a violation of international law\".\nWorks include\nA Social Science of Human Rights?

    "1376 battle between Albanian and French forces in modern-day Albania\nThe Battle of Durazzo (Albanian: Beteja e Durr\u00ebs),  was fought in the midsummer of 1376, between the Principality of Albania under Karl Thopia and Navarrese Company under Louis of \u00c9vreux at Durr\u00ebs. The Navarrese Company who were hired by Louis of \u00c9vreux to support him in recovering his newly acquired rights of Durazzo and the Kingdom of Albania.\nBackground\nJoanna, Duchess of Durazzo who was the eldest daughter of Charles, Duke of Durazzo inherited the rights to the Kingdom of Albania after her father's death, and reigned as a duchess. In 1365 Louis of \u00c9vreux married Joanna and inherited the rights to the Kingdom of Albania becoming the Duke of Durazzo by right of his wife. Karl Thopia from the Albanian Thopia family conquered and took control of Durr\u00ebs in 1368 and incorporated it into the Principality of Albania. Durr\u00ebs held the last of the Angevins, they held out the kingdom before Karl Thopia conquered Durr\u00ebs which led to the Kingdom of Albania becoming disestablished. After this event occurred Louis made various attempts to expel the intruders from Durazzo and Albania as a whole, but these documents have been lost to obscurity.\nBattle\nLouis of \u00c9vreux's brother Charles II of Navarre who was King of Navarre.\nThe great final effort by Louis of \u00c9vreux to regain his right to rule over the Kingdom of Albania and reestablish it began. In 1372 he planned to expel the intruders from his land at once. Louis hired four companies of knights from Navarre who are referred to as the Navarrese Company. More soldiers were recruited and added to the numbers of the Navarrese Company, but the chief contingents and the most important leaders were engaged by 1375\u20131376. These soldiers came directly from Navarre to Albania and many extensive preparations were made for this invasion. But little is known about the overall expedition to Albania. Louis received much assistance from his brother Charles II of Navarre who was the King of Navarre and from Charles V of France who was the King of France.  The ranks of the Navarre Company swelled considerably in 1375 with new recruits directly from Navarre. The four leaders of the Navarrese Company were Pedro de la Saga, Mahiot de Coquerel, both of which who were chamberlains of the Navarrese king. John de Urtubia and finally Garro or Guarro who is referred to as squires in a document. The battle began in the Midsummer of 1376 and Louis and the Navarrese Company were successful in occupying Durr\u00ebs. Officially Reestablishing the Kingdom of Albania.\nAftermath\nAfter Louis of \u00c9vreux and the Navarrese Company succeeded   in gaining back Durr\u00ebs and establishing the Kingdom of Albania. Louis of \u00c9vreux died shortly after in the same year. Since the Navarrese Company was under the service of Louis their contract was terminated soon after his death.  It is possible that the Navarrese Company may have continued to serve the widow Joanna of Durazzo until her second marriage. Left stranded after Louis's death and anxious to return to their homes in Navarre and Gascony the Navarrese Company spent two or three difficult years in Durazzo. After those few years passed the Navarrese Company passed into Morea leaving Durr\u00ebs and going into the service of Jacques de Baux, John of Urtubia or Nerio Acciajuoli.

    "Rafael Nadal began his tennis career in earnest with achievements in junior tournaments, winning the Spanish junior championships in 1997 and 1998 and the U12 Junior Masters in Stuttgart in 1998. By 1999, Nadal was competing in the U14 circuit, winning titles like Tim Essonne and Les Petits As. His early success continued into 2000, culminating in his victory at the U14 Spanish championships and his contribution to Spain's triumph in the ITF World Junior Championship for U14s. Despite offers to train in Barcelona, Nadal's family opted to keep him in Mallorca, where he continued to develop under the mentorship of his uncle Toni and Carlos Moy\u00e1.\nIn 2001, Nadal turned professional at 14, competing primarily in ITF junior events and making his mark on the ATP Tour. He reached the semi-finals of the junior singles event at Wimbledon in 2002 and won his first ATP match in Mallorca. By 2003, Nadal was ascending the ranks, winning his first Challenger title and breaking into the Top 100. He captured his first ATP title in Sopot in 2004 and played a pivotal role in Spain's Davis Cup victory. In 2005, Nadal's career skyrocketed as he won 11 singles titles, including his first French Open, defeating Roger Federer in the semi-finals. This victory established him as a dominant force on clay, earning him the nickname \"King of Clay.\"\nNadal continued his dominance on clay, winning multiple French Open titles, and became known for his intense rivalry with Federer. In 2008, he claimed his first Wimbledon title in an epic final against Federer, widely regarded as one of the greatest matches in tennis history. That year, Nadal also won Olympic gold in singles and secured the No. 1 ranking for the first time. He added his first Australian Open title in 2009, completing a career Grand Slam with his US Open victory in 2010. Despite struggles with injuries, Nadal remained a formidable competitor, winning titles, including his record-extending French Open championships.\nNadal's resilience was evident as he overcame injuries and returned to top form, winning his 10th French Open in 2017 and his 20th Grand Slam title at the 2020 French Open, tying Federer's record. He continued to compete at a high level, capturing his 21st Grand Slam title at the 2022 Australian Open and his 14th French Open title that same year, setting a new record. Nadal's career has been marked by his tenacity, sportsmanship, and ability to perform under pressure. Despite facing challenges, he maintained a position among elite players, achieving a milestone by finishing 2022 as the oldest year-end No. 2 player. In 2023, Nadal's career was marred by injuries, leading to his withdrawal from major tournaments and ending his record 912-week streak in the Top 10. He announced plans to return to the ATP tour in 2024, starting with the Brisbane International, where he made a comeback before an injury forced him to miss the Australian Open.\n1997\u20132000: Juniors\nNadal won the Spanish junior championships in 1997 and 1998, beating Ricardo Villacorta and Marcel Granollers respectively. In 1998 he completed the double as a junior, winning the Spanish championship in doubles with his great friend Tomeu Salv\u00e1, beating Di\u00e1z and Granollers in the final. Nadal then reached the final of the U14 Spanish championship at the age of 12, a feat that remains unmatched, losing to Juan Sanchez de Luna in straight sets. In late 1998, Nadal won the season-ending U12 Junior Masters at Stuttgart, beating future world No. 5 Kevin Anderson in the final.\nIn February 1998, Nadal won the Open Super 12, an unofficial world championship for U12 players held in Auray. It was the first time that Nadal competed outside of Spain and he beat the 1997 winner Jamie Murray in the final. At the time, Nadal was still hesitating between football and tennis, partly because his uncle Miguel \u00c1ngel was preparing to compete in the 1998 FIFA World Cup with Spain, but in the end it was Auray who decided it. In a letter in French that he sent to the organizers in 2010, Nadal stated that winning this tournament helped him make the decision to \"opt for tennis and try an international career\". Latter in 1998, when Nadal was runner-up in the U14 event Spanish championship, he was still playing football. Nadal's father told him he had to choose between football and tennis so that his schoolwork would not deteriorate entirely. Nadal said: \"I chose tennis. Football had to stop straight away.\"\nIn 1999, the 12-year-old Nadal was already playing in the U14 circuit of the ETA Junior Tour, currently known as the Tennis Europe Junior Tour, winning the prestigious Tim Essonne, and finishing the year at No. 69.

    "\nSir Alexander Macdonald, 7th Baronet, 14th Chief of Sleat (1711 \u2013 23 November 1746) was a Scottish Chief of Clan Macdonald of Sleat.\nEarly life\nMacdonald was born in 1711. He was the son of Sir James Macdonald, 6th Baronet and the former Janet Macleod. From his mother's first marriage to John Macleod, 2nd of Talisker (a grandson of Sir Roderick MacLeod, 15th Chief of Clan MacLeod), he had an elder half-brother, Donald MacLeod, 3rd of Talisker. From his parent's marriage, his siblings included Margaret Macdonald (wife of Sir Robert Douglas, 6th Baronet) and Janet Macdonald (wife of Sir Alexander Mackenzie, 5th Baronet).\nHis paternal grandparents were Sir Donald Macdonald, 3rd Baronet and Lady Mary Douglas (a daughter of the 8th Earl of Morton and Anne Villiers). His maternal grandparents were Alasdair MacLeod, 2nd of Grishornish and Margaret MacQueen.\nCareer\nUpon the death of his father in 1723, he succeeded as the 7th Baronet Macdonald, of Sleat, in the Isle of Skye, County Inverness, created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1625. In 1745, he supported the Government during the Jacobite rising of 1745, almost the only person in the district to do so.\nPersonal life\nPortrait of his sons James and Alexander, attributed to William Mosman, 1740s, National Galleries of Scotland\nOn 3 April 1733, Macdonald married Anne, Lady Ogilvy, (n\u00e9e Erskine) (c.\u20091708\u20131735), a daughter of David Erskine. Anne was the widow of James Ogilvy, Lord Ogilvy, the eldest son and heir apparent of David Ogilvy, 3rd Earl of Airlie and Lady Grizel Lyon (a daughter the 3rd Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne) Before her death on 27 November 1735, they were the parents of:\nDonald Macdonald (b. 1734), who died young.\nAfter her death, he married Lady Margaret Montgomerie (d. 1799) on 24 April 1739 at St. Paul's Church, Edinburgh. Lady Margaret was a daughter of Alexander Montgomerie, 9th Earl of Eglinton, and Susanna Kennedy (a daughter of Sir Archibald Kennedy, 1st Baronet). Together, they were the parents of:\nSir James Macdonald, 8th Baronet (c.\u20091742\u20131766), an accomplished scholar and mathematician who died unmarried in Rome, Italy.\nAlexander Macdonald, 1st Baron Macdonald (c.\u20091745\u20131795), who married Elizabeth Diana Bosville, eldest daughter of Godfrey Bosville IV of Gunthwaite, and sister of Col.

He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest surviving son, the ten year-old James. His widow lived for more than fifty years until her death on 30 March 1799. After James' death without issue in 1766, the baronetcy passed to his next son, Alexander, who was created Baron Macdonald in the Peerage of Ireland in 1776. His youngest son, who was born after his death, was created a baronet in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom upon his retirement as Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1813.\nDescendants\nThrough his son Alexander, he was posthumously a grandfather of Hon. Diana Macdonald (wife of Sir John Sinclair, 1st Baronet); Alexander Macdonald, 2nd Baron Macdonald (an MP for Saltash who died unmarried);. Godfrey Macdonald, 3rd Baron Macdonald (who married Louisa Maria La Coast, the illegitimate daughter of Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh); and the Hon.

Thomas Randolph, son of Rt. Rev. Dr. John Randolph).\n",
    "Hans de Kroon is a Dutch ecologist specializing in plant and insect life who works at Radboud University, where he chairs the Experimental Plant Ecology group. He is known for a 2007 study that concluded that in Germany \"the abundance of flying insects has plunged by three-quarters over the past 25 years\".\nFuture Dikes\nDe Kroon has applied his research to practical purposes, particularly to the extended system of dikes in the Netherlands. In 2022 he argued that the 17,000 kilometers of dikes in the country offered a great opportunity to provide a habitat of wildflowers and grasses for insects. By 2023 he was leading the \"Future Dikes\" group from Radboud University, which established how flood-resistant a dike reinforced by flowers, grass, and herbs was. The group noted that the great variety of dikes and environments called for different plants in different areas; for instance, they found that only 25 types of plants were appropriate for the heavy clay dikes (grazed by sheep) along the Wadden Sea, but a test dike in Gelderland had over sixty kinds, and others might have up to two hundred.\nIn June 2024 the group published its report, concluding that the new standard for dike management should be that they be planted with lots of flowers, which strengthen the dikes against increasing summer drought and annual floods. Such dikes also offer an opportunity for insects, and their management would require less time and money in mowing.\nIn 2024 he was appointed to the board of Utrechts Landschap, one of the 12 provincial landscape foundations in the Netherlands.\nNotable publications\nHallmann, Caspar A.; Sorg, Martin; Jongejans, Eelke; Siepel, Henk; Hofland, Nick; Schwan, Heinz; Stenmans, Werner; M\u00fcller, Andreas; Sumser, Hubert; H\u00f6rren, Thomas; Goulson, Dave; De Kroon, Hans (18 October 2017). \"More than 75 percent decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas\".

    "2024 Israeli attack on refugee camp in Gaza\nOn 8 June 2024, during a rescue operation carried out by Yamam, the Shin Bet and Israel Defense Forces (IDF) units in the UNRWA Nuseirat refugee camp, at least 276 Palestinians were killed and over 698 injured, according to the Hamas media office and Palestinian health officials from Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital and Al-Awda Hospital. According to reports, Al-Aqsa Hospital was overwhelmed with casualties, while communications were disrupted by intense Israeli bombing. Four Israeli hostages held by Hamas at Nuseirat were rescued in the operation, including Noa Argamani. Hamas said that three other hostages were killed, including an American hostage, but the IDF rejects this claim.\nThe event took place two days after an Israeli airstrike in the same camp hit the al-Sardi school that was sheltering displaced Palestinian refugees, Local health officials reported the deaths of more than 30 people, including 12 women and children. Israel said it was targeting Hamas militants who took part in the 7 October attack.\nBackground\nThe Nuseirat refugee camp is a long standing UNRWA refugee camp located in the middle of the Gaza Strip, in Deir al-Balah. The camp has been repeatedly bombed during the Israel-Hamas war, with over a hundred Palestinians killed in the attacks. The most recent attack on the camp occurred only days before the rescue operation, with IDF forces striking the UNRWA school in the camp, killing at least 33 people. It is unclear how many of this number were civilians.\nAssault\nSee also: 2024 Nuseirat rescue operationAn Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said that the rescue mission took place in the heart of the residential neighborhood in the Nuseirat refugee camp, where the four hostages were reportedly kept in two separate residential apartment blocks. The operation reportedly involved hundreds of troops and heavy air support that hit parts of the refugee camp.\nSome special forces members entered the refugee camp posing as Palestinian refugees fleeing Rafah per Saudi reporters. They reportedly told locals that they were escaping the Israeli assault on Rafah, while other Palestinian locals alleged that other forces entered in humanitarian trucks. According to witnesses, Israeli military vehicles unexpectedly moved into the camp, the movement coinciding with heavy bombardment of large areas of the camp.\nAccording to the IDF, a large firefight occurred as the rescue forces were attempting to disengage with the hostages, reportedly coming under fire from dozens of militants with RPGs and machine guns when their vehicle became stuck necessitating defensive airstrikes which killed militants and civilians. A local resident and paramedic called the attack like a \"horror movie\" and that Israeli drones and warplanes fired throughout the night at people's homes and those who tried to flee. Many individual testimonies of eyewitnesses who survived the intense fire-fight have been collected, according to Mondoweiss.\nAccording to Hamas, several Israeli hostages were killed in the Israeli attack. Social media footage that Reuters was unable to immediately verify showed the aftermath of the assault, with bodies with entrails hanging out on bloodstained streets. Hamas claimed in a video clip that three hostages were killed during the operation including an American.\nA video showing an IDF helicopter taking off from the beach with the US humanitarian-aid pier in the background began to circulate online on 8 June and US was accused of using the humanitarian pier in the IDF operation, but two US officials denied the accusations. The World Food Programme paused its operation in the pier due to security concerns and UN human rights experts condemned the Israeli forces for allegedly hiding in aid trucks that came from the pier.\nCasualties\nThe Gaza Health Ministry and health officials reported that at least 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 were wounded due to the Israeli rescue operation. Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that Israeli was aware of \"under 100\" Palestinians had been killed in the operation. Neither the health ministry nor Hagari clarified how many casualties were civilians. The Gazan Health Ministry reported that 64 children and 57 women were killed.\nTrucks and ambulances rushed casualties to Al-Aqsa Hospital for treatment.

    "Australian rules football club\nThe Fitzroy Reds was an Australian rules football club based in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy.\nThe club was formed in 1954 as the University Reds (or simply Uni Reds), competing in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA).\nIn December 2008, the club merged with the Fitzroy Football Club, which is now officially known as \"Fitzroy Football Club (incorporating the Fitzroy Reds)\" and currently competes in the VAFA's Premier Division.\nHistory\nUniversity Reds was formed in 1954, joining the University Blacks and University Blues as the Melbourne University Football Club's third team in the VAFA for the 1955 season.\nThe club, which was originally in E Section and known as \"University (E)\", provided opportunities for Blacks and Blues players who were not selected in either of those sides to get a regular match.\nIn 1964, the VAFA mandated reserves teams for all clubs. This forced the Reds to go into recess, however they soon returned and joined the Federal Football League (FFL) before returning to the VAFA in 1973 after two seasons in the FFL.\nThe Reds won their first seniors premiership in F Section in 1980.\nSplit from Melbourne University\nFollowing the 1997 season, under increasing pressure from the Melbourne University Sports Union to meet the required number of undergraduate and post graduate registrations to obtain funding, the club split from the university and were renamed to Fitzroy Reds, with 1998 their first season competing under the new name.\nIn 2003, the Reds played a curtain-raiser match against West Brunswick at the MCG before the Brisbane Lions met Collingwood during the AFL Heritage Round.\nMerger with Fitzroy\nOn 2 April 2008, Reds president Craig Little announced a plan to merge the club with the Fitzroy Football Club. Fitzroy had left the AFL following the 1996 season, but had not entirely disbanded and had a sponsorship arrangement with the Reds.\nIn December 2008, the Reds formally transferred all its assets to the Fitzroy Football Club. The Reds terminated its membership of the VAFA and was wound up as an incorporated company and football club. \nBy special dispensation from the VAFA, the Fitzroy Football Club then replaced the Reds in Division 1 of the VAFA, beginning in the 2009 season, fielding a senior and reserves side, as well as two under-19s sides and a Club XVIII side.\n",
    "Building in North Indian Canyon Drive\nMargaritaville Resort Palm Springs is a resort hotel in Palm Springs, California. It occupies 16 acres (6.5\u00a0ha), and includes 398 rooms, as well as 40,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (3,700\u00a0m2) of meeting and banquet space.\nThe property opened as the Riviera in 1959. It included the city's first convention center, and a golf course that operated for the next two decades. Ownership of the resort has changed numerous times since the 1960s. The property was known as the Riviera for much of its history, sometimes operating under variations such as Holiday Inn-Riviera (1965\u20131969) and Hilton Riviera (1978\u20131988), in affiliation with Holiday Inn and Hilton Hotels respectively. It also once operated as the Radisson Palm Springs Resort (1988\u20131992), in partnership with Radisson Hotels.\nThe Riviera was closed from 2006 to 2008, allowing for a $70 million renovation. It closed again in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was rebranded by the end of the year as a Margaritaville resort, becoming the chain's first location on the U.S. west coast. It is owned by Apollo Global Management and DiNapoli Capital Partners through a joint venture known as AGRE DCP Palm Springs.\nHistory\nEarly years (1950s\u20131990s)\nThe property began as the Riviera, owned by Irwin Schuman and his brother Mark Schulman. The name was copied from the unaffiliated Riviera hotel-casino in Las Vegas. Groundbreaking took place on March 21, 1959, and construction reached the halfway point four months later. The project ultimately cost $3 million. It opened at the end of October 1959, while construction was still underway in certain areas. A formal opening was held the following month. The hotel appeared in the 1963 film Palm Springs Weekend, and was popular among celebrities throughout the decade. Those who entertained at the Riviera included Bing Crosby, Jerry Lewis, Dick Contino, and members of the Rat Pack.\nIn 1965, the property was sold to the Holiday Inn chain, which rebranded it as the Holiday Inn-Riviera. The property had 400 employees at that time. Gotham Hotels, based in New York, purchased the property in 1969, renaming it the Riviera Hotel and Country Club. The Riviera had thrived under the Schuman/Schulman ownership, becoming popular for its entertainment, fine dining, and service. However, the subsequent owners failed to maintain this reputation, and the property entered bankruptcy in 1972. The brothers bought back the Riviera in 1974 and launched a renovation project to restore its past prominence.\nIt was renamed the Hilton Riviera in 1978, through a franchise agreement with Hilton Hotels, marking the latter's first property in Palm Springs. The partnership helped the Riviera to attract tourists and conventions outside of the Southern California area. Schuman continued managing the hotel until his death in 1983. The property was renovated later that year.\nIn 1984, the Schulman family sold the Riviera to Galadari Hotels, marking its first U.S. property. Further renovations were underway in 1985, with funding by HomeFed Bank. Half of the Riviera remained open during the renovation work, which was in response to competition from new hotels in the area. The project modernized the aging resort, gutting the rooms and updating the 1950s architecture. An early idea was to demolish the Riviera and rebuild it from scratch.\nGaladari filed for bankruptcy in 1986, and plans to sell the Hilton Riviera were disrupted when it went into receivership, with HomeFed soon taking it over. Additional renovation work took place in 1988, accompanied by a Radisson Hotels partnership. The property was renamed Radisson Palm Springs Resort, and renovations concluded in 1989. A year later, the hotel was sold to Carpenters Pension Trust of Southern California, which later became Southwest CPT. The Radisson name was dropped in 1992, and the property once again became the Riviera.\nLater years (2000s\u2013present)\nThe Riviera closed on June 1, 2006, after it was sold to HBF Noble House LLC, a partnership of Noble House Hotels Resorts and HBF Holdings. The hotel's contents were liquidated, as the new owners launched a two-year, $70 million renovation of the entire property, giving it a Hollywood Regency design. The Riviera reopened on October 15, 2008. Noble House bought out its partner in 2012, and sold the Riviera to Apollo Global Management in 2015, for $44 million. Apollo owns the hotel through AGRE DCP Palm Springs, a joint venture with DiNapoli Capital Partners. In 2016, the Riviera joined Starwood's Tribute Portfolio, which consists of independent upscale hotels.\nThe Riviera was closed in March 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic reached California. Later that year, plans were announced to convert the property into a Margaritaville resort. The rebrand was already being planned prior to the pandemic, and the resulting closure allowed renovations to be expedited. It reopened on November 25, 2020, as Margaritaville Resort Palm Springs. It was the first Margaritav",

    "\nThe Garachop carpets, pile-woven carpets of the Gazakh group of the Ganja-Gazakh type.\nGeneral information\nGreen Ground Karachopt Kazak Rug Sotheby's.\nThe name of this carpet of the Gazakh group of the Ganja-Gazakh type is related with the names of several villages located 20\u00a0km northwest of Gazakh, in the territory of present-day Georgia. The word Garachop in the aggregate referred to the villages of Mughanli, Lambali, Tullar, Gambali and Duzagram in the former Mughanly region inhabited by the ethnic Azerbaijanis. These villages, especially Lambali, Mughanly and Tullar are the main centres of the Gazakh carpet weaving group. The Borchali carpet weaving centre is closely related to the mentioned villages. The carpets woven in this area are also known as Garabirchak. As per the book Carpet Weavers of the Gazakh-Borchali Region by Vidadi Muradov, the Garachop carpets are still woven in Bolnisi (Choruk Gamarli), Marneuli (Sarvan) and Dmanisi (Bashkechid) regions in the territory of Georgia, inhabited by the Azerbaijanis. According to Book of Dede Korkut, the word gara means large, chop means native place/area or intention (about something) referring to local people.\nArtistic analysis\nThe Garachop carpets of the 19-20th centuries are of simple artistic design. In rare cases, high-quality and fine carpets woven upon a special order can be found. The border stripes surrounding the intermediary field of the Garachop carpets are identical to those of the carpets Ganja and Gazakh while the green central field is more typical for the Garachop carpets.\nThe Garachop carpet has a unique and celebrated artistic composition which consists of an intermediary field and border. The upper part of the central field symmetrically repeats at the bottom. The centre is filled with the large square medallion covering 1/3 of the carpet. Inside the medallion there is an eight-pointed star on the background with an armour-shaped ornament. Inside the star there is a small eight-pointed medallion, above and below there are two pairs of ram horns in a square and squares with horn-shaped protrudings along the four sides. The upper and lower parts of the central field have several different-sized rectangles. The largest ones are depicted in four corners of the central field. As a rule, their inner part is decorated with 9 eight-pointed flowers, the outer part \u2013 with the stylized horns called garmagli (with hooks).\nThe squares between the squares mentioned above have the stylized image of the tree of life. The rest of the central field is filled with the two pairs of ram horns ornament. The ornament is depicted inside and outside the square. The border consists of three parts: wide central border (sometimes called middle or mother border) and narrow borders on its left and right. The central border is formed by the repetition of elements typical for this carpet and is of several types. The most typical element is the depiction of four joint arrows in the centre together with two pairs of ram horns and toothed rhombus ornaments. The carpet also uses the border called mashal (torch) or shamdanli (with candlestick). The most typical small border of the Garachop carpet is called mollabashi (head of Mullah), the rarer border is formed by three-pointed motif, sometimes meander border can also be seen. As a rule, the main elements of this carpet are placed symmetrically, while the filling elements are placed asymmetrically.\nThe central field of the Garachop carpets is mainly decorated with a large eight-pointed medallion. The identical small medallions surrounded with hook-shaped protrusions are placed in the corners of the central field. The hooked protrusions extend along the inner line in the central medallion, in the small medallions they interchange along the outer line. The inner field with the white background has a number of small star-shaped patterns.\nColouring.\nThe central field of the Garachop carpets is usually green, red or light-blue. The eight-pointed ornament in the central medallion, the square medallions in four corners of the medallion and the central border are usually depicted on the white background.\nSemantics.\nThe four-cornered carpet is the projection of the world, the centre of the carpet is its most sacred part. The elements in the centre and the most used elements bear the main semantics of the carpet. A pair of joint ram horns, rhombus with two or four hooks, square, 9 eight-pointed stars are the typical motifs of this carpet.\n9 eight-pointed stars. As a rule, the large square medallions in four corners of the Garachop carpets always have 9 eight-pointed stars inside. Repetition of these stars in the medallions is the typological feature of the Garachop carpet. It is very important to analyse the role of the number \"9\", since the amount of the stars bear the semantic meaning. The Turkic peoples consider \"9\" to be a sacred number.\nTechnical features\nThe Garachop carpets are mainly medium-sized. The density of these carp",
    "Filipino artist (1934-2021)\nSofronio Mendoza (March 11, 1934 - September 21, 2021) was a Filipino painter and teacher who mentored young artists in the Philippines and in Canada.  He is better known by his monogram SYM he signed his paintings.\nEarly life and education\nSofronio Ylanan Mendoza was born in the Putat, Bagong Bayan, Cebu in 1934. As a young child, he dreamed of becoming an illustrator being drawn to superheroes in comic books. Specifically, he was fascinated by the line work of Francisco V. Coching. He then managed to hone his skills under the tutelage of renowned Carcar-based Martino Abellana, who Mendoza credited as an early influence in representational painting.\nHe attended the Colegio de San Jose at Cebu City and through the years, he had been a self-supporting student. In his late twenties, he left Cebu for Manila to further his craft. He became homeless sleeping in Luneta Park. He then found work in Ermita, where he became acquainted with artists in Mabini Street, associated with lowbrow commercial painters who favored \"conservative\" aesthetics. He managed to eke out a living creating paintings for foreign dealers and tourists. Eventually, he found a patron that would sponsor his formal art studies.\nIn 1963, he enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas College of Fine Arts and Design in Manila. Later, he transferred to the University of the East's newly opened School of Music and Arts.\nDimasalang Group\nJoining plein air painting sessions, Mendoza co-founded the Dimasalang Group of Artists in 1968. The word Dimasalang originated from the pseudonym of Philippine national hero and freedom fighter Dr. Jose Rizal. But the group's name was adopted after the street in Manila, where Mendoza's ramshackle studio on 1430 Dela Fuente, was located. Later on, the Dimasalang group moved to Novaliches but the name stuck to them. The group produced impressionist still lifes, landscapes and genre pieces distinct from the nascent Modernism in the Philippines.\nThe original members of group besides SYM were journalist-painter E. Aguilar Cruz, Ibarra dela Rosa, Andres Cristobal Cruz and Romulo Galicano, Mendoza's future brother-in-law. He also became a mentor to many young aspiring artists bringing forth Dimasalang II, with which his younger brother Godofredo Mendoza was a member.\nIn 1981, Mendoza and his family immigrated to Canada. He was offered a four-year contract work by Heffel Gallery on Granville Street, Vancouver. Two months after, he and his wife decided to move to Richmond, BC.\nIn Canada, he organized the Dimasalang III International Artist Group. He held regular art lessons and led on-the-spot painting sessions.\nFor decades, SYM was a realist and impressionist artist favoring street scenes and landscapes in his motherland and later in British Columbia. Beginning in 2000, he became a neo-cubist, explaining that it was a return to his roots.\nPersonal Life\nSofronio Y. Mendoza was married to Elena P. Villanueva. They had seven children \u2014 Symele, Vilmen, Sovila, Zael, Ronel, Yvi and Eleza \u2014 all born in the Philippines. He died in Vancouver on September 21, 2021. He was 87.\n",

In addition, Sharifa also published \"History of Unearthed Figures in Taiwan\" in the 1980s, describing Taiwan's predecessors such as Tan Teng-pho, poet Wang Baiyuan, musician Chiang Wen-yeh, etc.\nIn 2017, he was awarded the 37th National Cultural Award, and subsequently donated all the prize money to establish the Romain Rolland Million Novel Award.\nLife\nChildhood and schooling\nSherifa was born on March 28, 1938, in Yongle Town, Taipei City, which was the most prosperous place in Taiwan's history during the Japanese period, Dadaocheng. Sharifa grew up in such a prosperous business and cultural place at that time. The mixture of diverse information allowed Sharifa to accept various ideas and express them in his art and writing creations. Sharifa, who loved painting since childhood, wanted to be an art teacher in the future after graduating from high school, so she decided to apply for admission to the Art Department of Taiwan Provincial Normal College (now the Art Department of National Taiwan Normal University). When he was in his third year, Wang Jianzhu, who had just graduated from the Art Department of the National Normal University, first started teaching at Keelung Middle School. Sharifa received special guidance from Teacher Wang Jianzhu and was successfully admitted to the Art Department of the National Normal University in 1955 (Level 48).\nAt that time, the president of the Normal University was Liu Zhen, the dean of the School of Liberal Arts was Liang Shih-chiu, and the head of the art department was Huang Chun-pi.

In 1959, Sharifa graduated from Normal University, and he and Li Yuanheng became the graduates selected to join the \"Fifth Moon Group\".\nSharifa was influenced by his teacher and began to plan his way abroad after graduation, heading to Paris, France.\nGo to Paris (1964\u20131968)\nWhen Sharifa first arrived in Paris, he first entered the sculpture studio of the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris and studied sculpture with Mr. Cordurier. In addition to creating sculptures in the academy, Sharifa was also guided and inspired by Xiong Bingming, who instilled in Sharifa the importance of \"philosophy\" in artistic creation. While in Paris, Sharifa was inspired by the Parisian habit of visiting cafes. By observing people on the street or in cafes, he used simple lines to outline the interaction of the crowds. When he returned home, he selected a few deformed paintings and turned them into an oil painting called \"Paris\". \"Characters\" series. In Paris, Sharifa also extended the series \"The Man Who Opened the Door\" to depict the alienation of Parisian people from the world.\nAt that time, Cherifah, Liao Xiuping, and Chen Jinfang were known as the \"Three Musketeers of Paris\".\nWhile studying sculpture at the college, Sharifa also started to get into printmaking through teacher Jean Delpech (1916\u20131988) in the evening class, beginning a fruitful \"ten years of printmaking\" in his creative process. While in Paris, as an Oriental living in the Western world, Sherifa ",
    "Lumberjack show in Ketchikan, Alaska\nThe Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show is a lumberjack show performed in Ketchikan, Alaska. Established in May 2000 by Rob Scheer, the show, is put on by the Wisconsin-based Lumberjack Sports International. Located near the Ketchikan Creek, the show's venue has 475 seats and is at the former site of the Ketchikan Spruce Mill, which closed in 1993. Ketchikan's economy once had a heavy reliance on the wood industry, peaking at the beginning of the 20th century but declining by the 1990s. The show pays homage to the city's lumber history.\nTwo teams of two lumberjacks each compete for the title of \"King of the Woods\". One team represents the Spruce Mill team of Ketchikan, while the other represents the Dawson Creek team of the Yukon. With a one-hour run time, the Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show features 13 events. The events include axe throwing, boom running, bucksawing, chainsaw carving, crosscut sawing, hot sawing, logrolling, obstacle pole racing, relay racing, speed climbing, tree climbing, tree topping, underhand chopping, and woodchopping. The show received positive reviews for being an engaging production that teaches about lumberjack history.\nLocation and venue\nThe show's venue circa 2014\nPerformed in Ketchikan, Alaska, the Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show is situated close to where Spruce Mill Way and Bawden Street intersect. Close to the Thomas Basin seawall at the opening of Ketchikan Creek, it is at the city's waterfront. The show's venue is one block away from where cruise ships are anchored. It is next to the Southeast Alaska Discovery Center, while the Salmon Landing Marketplace and Spruce Mill Development are right in front of the show's seating area. The show takes place on the former location of the Ketchikan Spruce Mill, which was built in 1898 and ceased operations in 1993 and used to be the biggest spruce mill worldwide. Lumberjacks employed at the mill produced lumber for the Klondike Gold Rush, nearby canneries, and World War II airplanes. The location remained unused until the show opened there.\nDuring both sunny and rainy weather, the show is performed in an amphitheatre containing a heated and enclosed grandstand. The seats are cushioned. The grandstand has 475 seats and is accessible to people with disabilities. The venue showcases historic photos and relics related from the timber industry. The show has is a gift shop that Eric Moya of Travel Weekly said evokes a Cracker Barrel through its \"appropriately rustic-Americana aesthetic\". The store sells cookbooks, lumberjack clothes, and calendars spotlighting each lumberjack performer. The shop sells an \"Kid's Lumberjack Axe\" that is completely made of wood, can be used for autographs, and is not actually an axe.\nHistory\nAndy Colle, a performer, does a standing block chop in 2009.\nThe Scheer family lived in Hayward, Wisconsin, where the Lumberjack World Championship is held every year. The six Scheer siblings took logging classes in their youth. Around 1979, Tina Scheer co-founded the Hayward-based Scheer's Lumberjack Show alongside two of her brothers. Their interest became a career as they started performing in touring productions and fairs throughout the year. The family added four additional shows. Two of the productions are in Wisconsin, while two are out of state. Based in Trenton, Maine, Timber Tina's Great Maine Lumberjack Show which was founded in 1996 by Tina. Founded by Rob Scheer in Ketchikan, Alaska, the Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show was first performed in May 2000.  The show is run by the Wisconsin-based Lumberjack Sports International, which has events shown on ABC, ESPN, the Outdoor Life Network, and TNN. The company employed two groups who traveled in semi-trailer trucks equipped with tree trunks people could scale. In the show's first season, passengers of cruise ships that docked in Ketchikan could purchase the show's tickets on the ships. The show is popular with cruise ship passengers. Running between May and September, it is performed between one and five times every day.\nKetchikan's economy used to rely significantly on the wood industry, reaching its height at the beginning of the 20th century. Southeastern United States lumberjacks visited Ketchikan in the summers to vie for the title of \"King of the Woods\". Timber groups at the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century engaged in contests. The Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show recreates the contests from that era. The lumber industry diminished in the 1990s, and the city's economy became fully committed to tourism. The show pays homage to the city's lumber history. The Ketchikan Pulp Company, a nearby pulp mill, had not long ago shut down, causing the unemployment of 1,700 workers in the logger sector. Between 1995 and 2000, the number of loggers in Naukati Bay who went every day to the forest for work dropped from 70 to roughly nine. When the show premiered, the loggers believed that the show could offer employment to the",

    "\nAntisemitism in Mexico dates to the establishment of the Mexican Inquisition in the 16th Century which involved the persecution of Jews as well as others accused of being crypto-Jews. This early form of anti-Judaism morphed over the centuries. In modern times, manifestations of antisemitism in Mexico have occurred throughout the 20th Century at various historical moments, although without forming official state policy. Similarly, such incidents have continued to be present in the early 21st Century.\nIn the early 20th Century, Mexican attitudes towards Jews was characterised as one of sympathetic curiosity, and immigration was permitted during the period when the United States and Canada had closed its borders. Subsequently, concerns over increased Jewish immigration led to public protests, anti-Jewish sentiments were expressed in local newspapers, and antisemitic campaigns were initiated to boycott Jewish businesses. Notwithstanding the migration issue, the full extent of antisemitic activity during this period cannot be attributed to the sole cause of Jewish immigration. In this period, manifestations of antisemitism were documented; however, they seldomly were expressed through physical violence.\nManifestations of antisemitism in Mexico that have persisted into the 21st Century include the use of swastika graffiti along with hateful language, the targeting of Jewish public intellectuals, media personalities, and politicians. Targets of antisemitic speech included Claudia Sheinbaum, who successfully ran for the Mexican presidency in 2024.\nIncidents and trends of antisemitism are tracked by the Jewish community organization, Tribuna Israelita. In 2014, the Anti-Defamation League Global100 survey results found that 24% of the adult population harbor antisemitic views and beliefs.\nIn popular culture\nEl Santo Oficio (The Holy Office), a 1974 film directed and co-written by Arturo Ripstein exploring the antisemitism during the period of the Mexican Inquisition.\nFurther reading\nAcademic articles:\nLiwerant, J.

    "German poet\nNot to be confused with Otto Braun, the SPD politician, or Otto Braun (communist).\nOtto Braun (27 June 1897 \u2013 29 April 1918) was a German poet. During his lifetime, only one poem of his was published: Nachmittag an der Bzura appeared in 1915 in the patriotic magazine Wieland, without his knowledge or consent. After World War I however, his works were published posthumously in Germany, Great Britain, and the United States, amassing popularity and even becoming a bestseller in Germany. He was praised by authors such as Rudolf Borchardt, Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Rudolf Alexander Schr\u00f6der.\nBiography\nEarly life\nThe villa of the Braun family in Kleinmachnow near Berlin, built in 1909\nThe only son born of journalist, writer and social democratic women's rights activist Lily Braun and the social democratic politician and publicist Heinrich Braun\u00a0, Otto was considered a \"child prodigy\" and admired the poet Stefan George.\nAfter initially attending school in Berlin, from April 1907 to the end of September 1908 he attended the Landerziehungsheim Freie Schulgemeinde in Wickersdorf near Saalfeld in the Thuringian Forest, where he became friends with his classmate Otto Gr\u00fcndler\u00a0, three and a half years his senior. Introverted from a young age, Braun stood out due to his extraordinary erudition. This gave his adult contemporaries the impression of an \"overbearing precociousness.\" During this boarding school stay, he became involved in the simmering conflict between principal Paul Geheeb and the spiritus rector of the country school, Gustav Wyneken. The resulting everyday tensions caused the young Braun a large amount of trouble. When he took up with Geheeb's position, Wyneken regarded Braun as an opponent and treated him accordingly. He suffered from mood swings, isolating himself from his classmates and retreating into solitude, where he developed poems as well as fantasies. On 6 February 1908, Braun characterized Wyneken in a letter to his mother as the \"embodiment of all intrigue\". He also reported that Wyneken chose certain favorites among the male students whom he preferred.\nIn Gustav Wyneken's estate in the Archive of the German Youth Movement, a copy of Otto Braun's posthumous lyrical works and diaries published in 1919 were later found. In it, Wyneken had commented in handwriting: \"It is significant that so much fuss is being made about this book, as it is ideally suited as an example of mediocrity... Open any page! G. W.\"\nBraun found the lack of time and peace for his self-study unbearable during his time at boarding school. On September 2, 1908, he wrote to his mother:\n\"I just can't get into a good mood, because it can only be brought about by immersing myself with you. But there is no time for that.  Now I have a very strange feeling that I have never had before. I don't feel at home in Wickersdorf. I swear to you, with all that is sacred to us, with all that is beautiful and good, with all that is true in the world, that this feeling is not because I wanted to go to Berlin. I have it, there's no helping it now. It is mainly a feeling, of course, but there is also a rational reason: W.  gave a speech on the Wickersdorf world view at the foundation festival the day before yesterday. Something has changed, either I have changed or the others have changed; I think I have changed.  And this too: I cannot strengthen my will and my character here\".\nIn the same month, he attempted to escape from the boarding school, but this attempt ended at the train station in Saalfeld. This cry for help reached his parents, who then deregistered him from the Freie Schulgemeinde. Lily Braun personally picked up her son from there. In Spandau near Berlin, he began attending the K\u00f6nigliches Gymnasium before finally being taught by personal tutors.\nThe seeds of a poet\nOtto Braun, aged clockwise from upper left at 11, 14, 16, and 17.\nHis parents and teachers thought he was highly gifted. Therefore, Dr. Joseph Petzoldt\u00a0, head teacher at the K\u00f6nigliches Gymnasium zu Spandau and private lecturer at the Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg, author of Sonderschulen f\u00fcr hervorragend Bef\u00e4higte, applied to the Ministry of Spiritual, Educational and Medical Affairs on December 8, 1909, at the to be partially released from teaching duties and entrusted with the private instruction of the then twelve-year-old pupil. Petzoldt had personally convinced himself through several hours of discussions and careful reading of several of Braun's works \" that his talent was in no way overestimated, indeed that it is quite astonishing and wonderful.\" He reported that Otto Braun had already learned Middle High German in order to be able to read the Germanic heroic songs in the original, and Greek for the sake of the Pre-Socratics. Petzoldt's application met with incomprehension from the authorities and was rejected on March 17, 1910.\nEven as a child, Otto Braun frequented the home of the painter and salonni\u00e8re Sabine Lepsius and her husband, the Imp",
    "Triangle whose side lengths are consecutive positive integers and area is  a positive integer\nA Brahmagupta triangle is a triangle whose side lengths are consecutive positive integers and area is a positive integer. The triangle whose side lengths are 3, 4, 5 is a Brahagupta triangle and so also is the triangle whose side lengths are 13, 14, 15. The Brahmagupta triangle is a special case of the Heronian triangle which is a triangle whose side lengths and area are all positive integers but the side lengths need not necessarily be consecutive integers. A Brahmagupta triangle is called as such in honor of the Indian astronomer and mathematician Brahmagupta  (c.\u2009598 \u2013 c.\u2009668 CE) who gave a list of the first eight such triangles without explaining the method by which he computed that list.\nA Brahmagupta triangle is also called a Fleenor-Heronian triangle in honor of Charles R. Fleenor who discussed the concept in a paper published in 1996. Some of the other names by which Brahmagupta triangles are known are super-Heronian triangle and almost-equilateral Heronian triangle.\nThe problem of finding all Brahmagupta triangles is an old problem. A closed form solution of the problem was found by Reinhold Hoppe in 1880.\nGenerating Brahmagupta triangles\nLet the side lengths of a Brahmagupta triangle be ,  and  where  is an integer greater than 1. Using Heron's formula, the area  of the triangle can be shown to be\nSince  has to be an integer,  must be even and so it can be taken as  where  is an integer. Thus, \nSince  has to be an integer, one must have  for some integer  . Hence,   must satisfy the following Diophantine equation:\n.\nThis is an example of the so-called Pell's equation  with . The methods for solving the Pell's equation can be applied to find values of the integers  and .\nA Brahmagupta triangle where  and  are integers satisfying the equation .\nObviously ,  is a solution of the equation . Taking this as an initial solution  the set of all solutions  of the equation can be generated using the following recurrence relations\nor by the following relations\nThey can also be generated using the following property:\nThe following are the first eight values of  and  and the corresponding Brahmagupta triangles:\nThe sequence  is entry A001075 in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and the sequence  is entry A001353 in OEIS.\nGeneralized Brahmagupta triangles\nIn a  Brahmagupta triangle the side lengths form an integer arithmetic progression with a common difference 1. A generalized Brahmagupta triangle is a Heronian triangle in which the side lengths form an arithmetic progression of positive integers. Generalized Brahmagupta triangles can be easily constructed from Brahmagupta triangles. If  are the side lengths of a Brahmagupta triangle then, for any positive integer , the integers  are the side lengths of a generalized Brahmagupta triangle which form an arithmetic progression with common difference . There are generalized Brahmagupta triangles which are not generated this way. A primitive generalized Brahmagupta triangle is a generalized Brahmagupta triangle in which the side lengths have no common factor other than 1.\nTo find the side lengths of such triangles, let the side lengths be  where  are integers satisfying . Using Heron's formula, the area  of the triangle can be shown to be \n.\nFor  to be an integer,  must be even and one may take  for some integer. This makes\n.\nSince, again,  has to be an integer,  has to be in the form  for some integer . Thus, to find the side lengths of generalized Brahmagupta triangles, one has to find solutions to the following homogeneous quadratic Diophantine equation:\n.\nIt can be shown that all primitive solutions of this equation are given by\nwhere  and  are relatively prime positive integers and . \nIf we take  we get the Brahmagupta triangle . If we take  we get the Brahmagupta triangle . But if we take  we get the generalized Brahmagupta triangle  which cannot be reduced to a Brahmagupta triangle.\nSee also\nBrahmagupta polynomials\nBrahmagupta quadrilateral\n",
    "American sheriff\nChad Bianco is an American law enforcement officer currently serving as sheriff of Riverside County, California. He was first elected in 2018 and then re-elected in 2023. A political conservative, Bianco has been affiliated with the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association.\nCareer\nBianco was first elected Riverside County sheriff in 2018. He was re-elected in 2023 with about 60% of votes for a term set to last until 2028. Bianco has been hosted on Fox News, as well as by Conservative pastors on YouTube channels and podcasts. As of 2023, Bianco's department had over 3,600 employees and was managing five jails.\nIn 2020, during the Coronavirus Pandemic, Bianco stated that he would not enforce Coronavirus mandates and did not plan to get vaccinated. He tested positively for the virus in January 2021 with mild symptoms, after which he started quarantining at his home.\nIn 2022, Riverside County jails registered 18 inmate deaths, the biggest number in 15 years. The spike prompted multiple civil lawsuits against the county's prison facilities and Bianco himself. In 2023, Bianco's police department was placed under investigation by the California Department of Justice to determine if the organization had \"engaged in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional policing amid deeply concerning allegations relating to conditions of confinement in its jail facilities, excessive force, and other misconduct.\" In relation to those incidents, Bianco stated that \"every single one of these inmate deaths was out of anyone\u2019s control\".\nAwards\nBianco was awarded the 2023 Sheriff Award by the Claremont Institute.\nPersonal life\nBianco moved from Utah to California in 1989, and in 1993 attended the San Bernardino Sheriff\u2019s Academy. He graduated at the top of his class, and joined the Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department shortly after graduation. Bianco and his family attend Sandals Church in Riverside.\nFollowing a hacking incident in September 2021 against a database belonging to the Oath Keepers, Bianco, along with over 200 law-enforcement officers, was exposed as a former member of the organization. He later stated that he had paid for a $40 one-year membership in the organization in 2014 and did not renew it for the next year. Bianco has since disavowed the group's violent conduct.\nA Politico article stated that Bianco was considering running for Governor of California in 2026.\n",
    "2023 single by Tony Effe and Emma Marrone\n\"Taxi sulla Luna\" is a song recorded by Italian rapper Tony Effe and Italian singer Emma Marrone. It was released on 9 June 2023 through Universal Music Italia and Capitol Records, as the second single from both the rapper second studio album Icon and the singer seventh stoudio album Souvenir.\nComposition\nThe song is the first featuring between the two artists, mixing dance-pop and rap sounds. In an interview with All Music Italia, Emma explained the meaning of the song and the decision to collaborate with the rapper:It was an unexpected collaboration. I got the track, I liked it because I could and wanted to have fun with it. I thought it was spinning great, and in fact it made people dance all summer and still does.

    "Former oil complex in Peru\nLa Brea and Pari\u00f1as (Spanish: La Brea y Pari\u00f1as) was an industrial complex dedicated to the exploitation of the oil field located at the La Brea pampa and Pari\u00f1as ravine, located in northern Peru, at Talara Province, Piura. It operated from the early 19th century until 1968.\nFrom 1890 onwards, it was exploited by the Anglo\u2013American company London Pacific Petroleum Company, and from 1914 to 1968 by the American International Petroleum Company (IPC), a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey. The deposits gained notoriety from 1911, when it was discovered that their owners and tenants exploited many more lots than those originally registered, despite which, they refused to pay the taxes to which they were obliged according to Peruvian laws. The IPC even achieved advantageous tax and other exemptions from pro-American governments over several decades.\nThe long-standing controversy surrounding the refinery and its relation to the penetration of Anglo-American capitalism in Peru was the most scandalous case of its time, which had a considerable influence on the political sphere of the country. In 1968, the government of General Juan Velasco Alvarado ordered the military occupation of the complex, putting an end to the problem. However, the company never paid its debts to the Peruvian State.\nHistory\nOrigins\nThe sites' history begins during the initial years of Peru, a time in which they changed owners several times, until in 1873 they came into the possession of Genaro Helguero, who entered into deals with English capitalists interested in oil fields in the aftermath of the War of the Pacific. Despite the government demanding that he pay the tax of S/. 15 per pertenencia (even-shaped lots), he argued that the 1877 law applied to concessionaries and not to him, a fee simple owner.\nHelguero sold the terrain to Herbert W. C. Tweddle in 1888 at a cost of \u00a318,000. Tweddle established the London and Pacific Petroleum Company alongside businessman William Keswick to profit from the property. The company, named after the city where it was founded, was established with a share capital of \u00a3250,000. Its shareholders were Tweddle and Keswick themselves, as well as Lionell Ward, D. Jackson and O.A. Mygalt.\nIn 1888, the judge of Paita, by order of the then government of Andr\u00e9s A. C\u00e1ceres, ordered the measurement of the pertenencias, confirming the existence of 10 of them (each equivalent to 10,000 m2); and thus registering in the mine registry of Lima. The leagal tax for each pertenencia was changed to S/. 30. This measurement turned out to be wrong, as would later be discovered, since the land actually consisted of thousands more pertenencias. It has been argued that the error was due to the lack of skill of the measurers or lack of knowledge of the laws regarding this type of measurements. It also causes suspicion that the judge was an employee of Helguero.\nControversy begins\nControversy broke out on December 3, 1911, when the engineer Ricardo A. Deustua made a public complaint, in the sense that the London-based company exploited many more assets than those recognised by the judge of Paita and the government in 1888. Given this, The Minister of Development ordered the property to be measured again, with engineers H\u00e9ctor Boza and Alberto Jochamowitz being in charge of carrying it out. These, despite suffering the hostility of the English, who ordered the population to deny them even food and water, completed the work successfully, finding themselves surprised that there were not 10 but no less than 41,614 pertenencias.\nBy resolution of March 15, 1915, the first government of \u00d3scar R. Benavides ordered the mining property \"La Brea\" to be registered in the General Register of Mines, leaving its owner obliged to pay the new number of remeasured belongings and whose amount showed the amount of S/.1,248,420 a year and not S/.300 that had been paid. The local historian Reynaldo Moya Espinoza writes that Deustua said that, in 1914, the company was operating on 1,000 properties and had drilled 700 wells. That led to the assumption that in reality the fee to be paid should have been S/.30,000 per year, but things were not considered that way at that time.\" He also affirmed the exaggeration of the treasury's claim, since those S/.1,248,420 annually calculated on belongings both in production and out of production far exceeded the profits that the company obtained each year.\nThus calculated by the Peruvian government, a million-dollar tax was owed, which the company refused to pay because it was exaggerated. Rather, in 1914, it sold its lease rights to the International Petroleum Company (IPC), a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey. In 1924 the IPC became owner of the deposits, through a purchase from the Keswick's heirs. The IPC exploited the site, installing stations around the country and building two docks at the port of Talara, where it purchased ships to distribute oil around Peru.\nThe second gove",

    "The Diurnali del duca di Monteleone is an anonymous annals of the Kingdom of Naples for the years 1265\u20131458. The work was initially entitled Cronaca or Storia d'incerto autore ('history of an uncertain author') by Angelo di Costanzo in the 16th century. The title by which it is now known comes from a manuscript owned by Ettore III Pignatelli, Duke of Monteleone.\nThe Diurnali can be divided into three parts. The first part goes down to 1371. The second, covering the period from 1371 to the accession of Alfonso I in 1443, is the most historically valuable. It was written by a single author, probably one associated with the royal court. A later author from the city of Bari and a partisan of the Princes of Taranto extended it down to 1458. Its sources include the Breve chronicon of Guglielmo Marramaldo, the Annales of Tommaso Loffredo and the Diarium regum Neapolis et Siciliae.\nThe Diurnali is a vernacular Italian work. It was written for a popular rather than educated audience. Its style is lively, imitative of the cantari\u00a0 (popular songs), and it makes extensive use of direct speech. Its political perspective evolves from pro-Angevin to pro-Aragonese. It gives a positive portrayal of Queen Joanna I. The authenticity of the Diurnali as a late medieval work was questioned until its definitive defence by Bartolommeo Capasso\u00a0 in the late 19th century.\nEditions\nNunzio Federigo Faraglia\u00a0, ed.

Upon her marriage to Hugh Grosvenor, 7th Duke of Westminster in June 2024, she became the Duchess of Westminster.\nEarly life and family\nOlivia Grace Henson was born on 1 September 1992 in London to Rupert Cornelius Brooke Henson, a banker, and Caroline Belinda Frisby, a descendant of Sir Richard Hoare, founder of the bank C. Hoare & Co. Her maternal great-great-grandmother was Lady Geraldine Mariana Hoare (n\u00e9e Hervey, 1869-1955), the daughter of Lord Augustus Hervey and a great-granddaughter of the John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland. Henson's great-granduncle Henry Peregrine Hoare's (1901\u20131981) first wife, Anne, Lady Ebury, was the mother of Francis Grosvenor, 8th Earl of Wilton, the heir presumptive to Henson's husband's subsidiary title, Marquess of Westminster.\nEducation and career\nHenson attended Dragon School, a private school in Oxford, before attending Marlborough College, a boarding school in Wiltshire, alongside Princess Eugenie. She graduated from Trinity College, Dublin with a degree in Hispanic Studies and Italian. Henson works in the sustainable food and drinks industry. Since 2019, she has been working at Belazu, a London-based ethical food production company, and has previously worked for firms such as the pressed juices company Daily Dose.\nPersonal life\nIn April 2023, Henson's engagement to Hugh Grosvenor, 7th Duke of Westminster, was announced.

    "Political party system\nTwo-and-a-half party system is a party system where each of the two major political parties that stand apart on the political spectrum needs a coalition with a smaller \"half\" party for political control. The concept was proposed by Jean Blondel in his party system classification (1968), where the two-and-a-half party system occupies middle space between the two-party and multiparty systems. The system was quite rare in the first half of the 20th century, but its popularity grew after the Second World War, and peaked in the 1970s.\nExamples\nTypical examples of the two-and-a-half party arrangement include the late-20th century political systems of Germany, Austria, Canada, Ireland, and Australia.\nGermany\nFor a long time Germany politics used a classic two-and-half system with Union parties (CDU/CSU) and Social Democrats (SPD) playing the roles of the major parties, with Free Democratic Party (FDP) being a near-perfect example of the \"half\": while FDP never got more that 14% of the seats, it was part of the government for 41 years out of the first 53 post-war years. Until 1998, the major changes in the German government (1969 and 1982) were not related to the swings of the vote count, but to FDP changing a different major party as its coalition partner. Germany party system started evolving towards a multiparty one already in the 1980s-1990s as the Greens became a significant political force.\nAustria\nAustrian party system closely mirrored the German one, with Socialists (SP\u00d6) and Christian Democrats (\u00d6VP) being the major parties. Liberals (FP\u00d6) and Greens playing the role of \"half\" parties. However, Austria had a long tradition of grand coalitions (1945\u22121966, 1987\u22121999), where the smaller parties were not in the government.\nCanada\nIn Canada, the Liberals and Conservatives are the major parties, with the New Democrats (until 1993) being the \"half\" (earlier, Social Credit can be considered \"half\" party). Due to Liberals being significantly stronger than the Conservatives, frequently Canadian hung parliaments resulted in minority governments without  formal coalitions; the winner of the plurality of votes aligned with smaller parties on ideas without providing them with the government seats.\nIreland\nIn Ireland, the Fianna F\u00e1il (Republicans) and the significantly smaller Fine Gael were the major parties setting the stage for two-and-a-half party system well into 1980s. The Republicans were sometimes winning an outright majorities in the parliament, while Fine Gail had to rely on half party support provided by the Labour. Since 1990s the Iris politics became multiparty and multidimensional, so more complex coalitions became possible.\nAustralia\nAustralia was a special case: technically, two major parties, the Liberals  and Labor together with a \"half\" National Party that helps Liberals get a majority is a two-and-a-half party system. However, the alliance between the Liberals and the National Party appeared to be unbreakable: the half party was represented in the government even when Liberals got a majority of their own and did not need the coalition, so the Australian system could also be thought of as a two-party one.\nShares of the votes\nIn the two-and-a-half party systems the major parties typically have a combined 75-80% of the vote, with a significant (10%) difference between them.\nThe percentage of votes sufficient for the party to become the \"half\" varies by the electoral system. For example, in the United Kingdom with its first-past-the-post voting, Liberal Democrats in the second half of the 20th century were getting about 20% of the votes for decades, but practically never (with the exception of the late 1970s) were able to participate in the government. In Germany where the proportional voting is used, Free Democrats, despite their much smaller share of votes (12-13%), were able on multiple occasions to decide whether the government be center-left or center-right.\nCritique\nThe concept of two-and-a-half party system is critiqued for lumping together the systems with very roles of the \"half\" party, from \"kingmakers\" like the Free Democrats in Germany prior to 1990s to \"wing parties\" like New Democrats in Canada with their less critical role. The researchers also question the need to highlight one smaller party in the otherwise very regular multiparty arrangement.\n",
    "Associate Head swimming coach for the University of Texas\nKris Kubik was an All-American competitive swimmer for North Carolina State and Auburn University and the Associate Head swimming coach for the University of Texas under Head Coach Eddie Reese.  In his thirty-four year tenure coaching University of Texas at Austin swimming from 1979 to 1981, and 1986 through 2016, he helped lead the Longhorns to 12 NCAA National team Championships, claiming titles in successive years for the 1989-91, 2000-02, and 2015-2016 seasons.\nKubik was born mid-1955 in Memphis, Tennessee to Dr. Burdette Kubik, a Dentist, and former coach, who moved to Memphis in 1948, and Mrs. Zelma Kubik an English teacher at Memphis State. The couple married in 1941, when Dr. Kubik was in Dental School at St. Louis University. By three, Kris was active in Cub Scouting, where his father served as a scoutmaster.  He grew up the youngest of four siblings in a swimming family, and was active in competitive swimming by the age of seven, first learning to swimm at a Red Cross swimming program.  As serious age-group competitors who performed strength training and practiced twice daily, by High School, he and each of his siblings were on at least one state swimming championship team and garnered many first-place finishes.\nEarly swimming achievements\nAt the age of only eight in April, 1964, Kris broke the Southeastern AAU age group record for boys eight and under in the 25-yard butterfly with a time of 15.6, and tied the age group record for the  25-yard freestyle with a time of :14.9.   In 1966, in an International competition with Canadian swimmers in Ontario, Canada, Kris took two gold medals, winning the 10-and-under 50-yard butterfly while setting a Canadian Open age group record with a time of 30.8.  Kris was also on the winning 200-yard medley relay team.  In 1966, at the age of 10, Kris had earlier recorded the second best American time in his age-group for the 50-yard butterfly with a 31.3, qualifying him for the Canadian meet.\nHigh school highlights\nKris attended and swam for the Memphis White Station High School Spartans under Coach Larry Heathcott where he graduated around 1973.  By his Junior year, at 16, he held two Southeastern AAU records, and would compete in the City's Interscholastic Athletic Associations' swimming title in the 100-yard butterfly, 200-yard freestyle, and 200 Medley Relay.  In Highly competitive age group swimming, from an early age he also swam under Coach Dick Fadgen for the Memphis Athletic Club team founded in 1956, and later the Memphis State Swim Club Team, which practiced at the Memphis State University campus. Dick Fadgen, Kris's primary High School Coach, would produce seven state championship swim teams with the Memphis Athletic Club and coach Memphis State University beginning in 1972.\n'72 Olympic Trials\nKris had hopes of qualifying for the 1972 Olympic swimming trials, and at a high point in his high school swimming career at seventeen, he qualified by swimming a 1:02.3 in the 100-meter backstroke at a meet in Cincinnati.  Three other Memphis State Swim Club participants made the trials with him.  Kubik competed in the trials in early August in Chicago but did not make the U.S. team, as his preliminary time of 1:03.55 was around 3.3 seconds short of qualifying in the highly competitive trials.  In 1972, he also qualified for the AAU National Meet in Louisville, Kentucky while swimming for the Memphis State Swim Club and recorded a qualifying time of :54.6 in the 100-yard backstroke.\nCollege swimming\nKris was an All-American swimmer for North Carolina State, where he swam under Head Coach Don Easterling.  In 1974, Kubik swam a conference record 1:57.07 in the 200-yard backstroke, breaking his own record by a second, and helping to lead North Carolina to its fifth straight victory in the Atlantic Coast Conference's swimming title.  By February 1975, while at North Carolina State, Kubik held Atlantic Coast Conference records in the 100-yard backstroke of 51.98, and in the 200-yard backstroke of 1:55.30.  North Carolina State dominated the conference records with Kubik's teammate Steve Gregg holding records in three events.\nHe transferred from North Carolina State to Auburn University where he graduated in 1978, and swam under Eddie Reese, with whom he would also serve as a student coach through the 1979 season.  Kubik would later have a long career as Associate coach when Kubik would leave Auburn to follow Reese to the University of Texas.\nCoaching\nKubik was Associate Head coach for the University of Texas under Head Coach Eddie Reese, from 1979 to 1981, and from 1986 through 2016.\nKubik left University coaching and academics for four years, where from 1981-1983, he was an age group coach for the Longhorn Aquatics Club, a high achieving age group swim club.  After two Assistant Coaches left, from around 1983-1985 he filled in as an Assistant Coach for the Nashville Aquatic Club, a quality program with 220 me",
    "\nFootball club\nBeeston St John's F.C. was an association football club from Nottingham, active in the late 19th century.\nHistory\nThe first record of the club is from 1886, when it entered the Nottinghamshire Church Football Association Cup.  The club however had greater ambitions, and entered the Nottingham Express Challenge Cup for more senior clubs that year, although it lost 7\u20130 in the first round to Kimberley Town.\nThe club first made its mark by beating Loughborough Town in a friendly at the end of 1887 - Beeston had turned up to Loughborough to play the second XI, but, after the Town first XI was disappointed in its fixture, offered to play the senior side instead.  It finished the season by winning the Church Cup with a 1\u20130 win over Mapperley, in front of 1,200 on the Castle Ground in Nottingham, albeit its opponent was handicapped by losing a man to a broken leg in the first half.\nThe club therefore entered the FA Cup for 1888\u201389, although that season qualifying rounds had been brought in.  It won its first tie, 2\u20130 at home to Notts Olympic; in the second qualifying round, the club was drawn away to Notts County.  As County also had a scheduled Football League match against Burnley on the same day, County hosted the matches as a double header, and fielded a reserve XI against St Johns - which was still good enough to win 4\u20132.\nThe turning professional of Nottingham Forest indirectly prevented the club from proceeding further.  A number of the Forest players left to form a new amateur club, simply called Beeston,  and both clubs entered the 1889\u201390 FA Cup qualifying rounds.  Both lost at the first time of asking (St John's to Jardines at home) and St John's did not enter again.\nThe club played in the Notts League from 1889 to 1890 until 1894\u201395, but withdrew from the competition in the middle of the latter season, and disbanded before the 1895\u201396 season.\nGround\nThe club's ground was at Padgers Road, near the Humber Limited works,\nNotable players\nHarry Walkerdine, who was made captain of the club in 1889 after a successful first season, but was poached by Notts County after one further match.\n",
    "2024 death of nine Indian climbers in Himalayan blizzard\nIn June 2024, nine Indian mountaineers died when a blizzard struck their location as they were trekking in the remote Himalayas in Uttarakhand state in north India.\nBackground\nOn 29 May 2024, 19 experienced trekkers from the Karnataka Mountaineering Association from Bengaluru in the southern Indian state of Karnataka started a 35-kilometer long high-altitude trek with three local guides in the remote Sahastra Tal area across the Himalayas. The group was planning to return by 8 June 2024.\nDisaster\nOn 3 June 2024 at around 14:00 (GMT+5:30), heavy snowfall struck the mountaineer group as they were returning from Lambtal to Sahastra Tal peak at an elevation of about 12,000 feet, which intensified into blizzard conditions that lasted for four hours. The group attempted to turn back to base camp in Lambtal to alert other mountaineers of their situation. By 18:00 (GMT+5:30), two mountaineers has died from the severe snow and wind in front of the group, which in addition to visibility dropping to near zero, made movement and orientation nearly impossible. The mountaineer group was forced to cluster together under a large rock to endure the night, where more mountaineers succumbed to the weather conditions. Two other mountaineers died on the morning of 4 June 2024, with five more succumbing on 5 June 2024. \nOn 4 June 2024 evening, a local guide was able to alert rescuers about their situation after being able to connect to a mobile network, and at 5 June 2024, the Indian Air Force reached the team with two Chetak helicopters and a private helicopter to evacuate the 13 survivors. The State Disaster Response Force also dispatched two teams to the location.\nAftermath\nAn Indian health official stated that the likely cause of death was hypothermia in addition to dehydration, exacerbated by the severe cold preventing them from drinking water.\nOn the evening of 6 June 2024, the bodies of the deceased were airlifted from Joshimath to Dehradun, where they will then be transported by road to Delhi and then by air from Delhi to Bengaluru.\nList of deceased\nAll of the victims were from Bengaluru, Karnataka.\nAsha Sudhakar, 71\nAnitha Rangappa, 55\nVenkatesh Prasad K., 53\nVinayak Mungurwadi, 54\nSujata Mungurwadi, 51\nPadmanabha K.

    "Engineering concept\nSafer End of Engineering Life, sometimes abbreviated to SEEL, is a concept that focuses on the importance of considering the entire lifecycle of a product or system. Currently there is a lot of focus on the decommissioning or retirement in particular industries. This includes but is not limited to plastic waste, electronic waste (sometimes shorted to e-waste), and construction and industrial waste.\nRecently, SEEL is becoming more of a focus in fields such as software engineering, industrial design, and infrastructure development.\nBackground\nThe idea behind SEEL is to mitigate risks and ensure safety not only during the active use phase of a product but also during its end-of-life processes, such as disposal, recycling, or decommissioning. This approach recognises that even after a product has served its intended purpose, it can still pose risks to the environment, public health, or safety if not managed properly.\nIn software engineering, SEEL may involve designing systems with built-in mechanisms for secure data deletion, ensuring that sensitive information is properly erased when software or hardware reaches the end of its useful life. It could also involve planning for software updates and patches to be maintained and deployed until the end-of-life date to address any security vulnerabilities that may arise over time.\nIn industrial design and manufacturing, SEEL may include considerations for recyclability, ease of disassembly, and the use of environmentally friendly materials. By designing products with end-of-life considerations in mind, manufacturers can facilitate the recycling or repurposing of components, reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact.\nRecent milestones\nThe Royal Academy of Engineering launched a global review in January 2021 into the further study of SEEL, as well as the impacts the lack of action was having, with potential goals and aims in the future.\nAn international workshop was held online in May 2022 with experts from 15 countries. The workshop aimed to reflect on the progress related to the safety challenges on how to ensure the global fleet of 50,000 ships and 10,000 offshore structures can be decommissioned in an environmentally friendly way. During the same year, the European Union also published a report into findings on offshore decommissioning.\nThe Lowy Institute also published reports into the dangers of how reliant the oil and gas industries were on aging infastructure.\nApplication & challenges\nA main focus in recent years has been the decommissioning of offshore structures and ships. Oil rigs as one example  have a complex decommissioning process. Even after decommissioning, there may still be infrastructure remaining on the seafloor, such as well casings or pipelines. Decommissioning oil rigs presents numerous challenges due to technical complexity, environmental concerns, regulatory compliance, cost, legacy infrastructure, and stakeholder interests. These structures are intricate and contain various components, which requires specialised knowledge. Removal of hazardous materials can also be difficult and costly.\n",
    "2024 video game\n2024 video game\nZoria: Age of Shattering is a 2024 role-playing video game developed by Tiny Trinket Games and published by Anshar Publishing and Surefire Games for the Windows and Linux.\nGameplay\nThe setting of the game is the fantasy world of Zoria, where the nation of Iziria has launched an invasion of the kingdom of Elion. The player assumes the role of Captain Witherel, a member of Elion's military forces. There are nine different character classes to select from in the game. Additionally, the player can recruit from a pool of over 50 companions, with the option to have up to four of them accompany Captain Witherel in a party simultaneously. The combat is turn-based.\nRelease\nZoria was developed by Tiny Trinket Games, a team of three people based in Bucharest, Romania. The game had a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2022. It was originally intended to be released in early access in April 2023 but developers decided to forego it. In August 2023, the game was set to be released in Q4 2023. It was eventually released on March 7, 2024. In May 2024, an update was released that added two classes to the game: Bard and Necromancer.\nReception\nPre-release\nPC Guru\u00a0 thought the demo version was enjoyable and liked the lore but had some issues with combat and the emptiness of the world. In a 2023 PAX West preview, RPGamer liked the combat and said the game feels fun but needs some polish. In a preview close to the release, RPGamer wrote: \"Tiny Trinket Games looks to have done a good job putting its own imprint onto cRPGs with Zoria: Age of Shattering.\" Rock Paper Shotgun had some issues with the user interface and graphical presentation but said it was \"an impressive feat\" for a small development team.\nPost-release\nRock Paper Shotgun called the game interesting and well made, although they noted that certain aspects may be overly ambitious. RPGFan summarized the game as \"an engaging tactical RPG with a few drawbacks involving its presentation and graphics\".\n",
    "Taiwanese researcher\nLiu Shuqin (born November 1, 1969--) is a researcher of Taiwanese literature who works at the Institute of Taiwanese Literature at Tsinghua University. Her research specialties include Taiwanese literature during the Japanese colonial period, Colonialism and literary production, and Comparative literature of East Asian colonies.\nLife\nLiu Shuqin was born on November 1, 1969, in Hualien, Taiwan. She once did short-term research at the Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University of Tokyo.\nResearch philosophy and academic concern\nRegarding the rising atmosphere of nationalism (whether in China or Taiwan) within the Department of Literature in Taiwan and in the country, Liu Shuqin once advised readers in the preface of her representative work \"The Thorny Road: Literary Activities and Cultural Struggles of Taiwanese Youth in Japan,\" saying: \"While fighting colonialism, the nation-state has to some extent fallen into the perspective of cultural essentialism. Nationalism has stifled various local differences, suppressed the multiple possibilities of local literature, and reduced multiple local cultural traditions.\" Compared with some scholars who use postcolonial discourse as a weapon for their discourse or as a theoretical basis for supporting Taiwan's independence or unification, she has a different view on postcolonial discourse, believing that \"the ultimate goal of postcolonial discourse is to liberate various regional and indigenous words and expressions from the monocultural dictatorship, and naturally show an equal dialogue between the local and the rest of the world from the inside out.\"\nRegarding the existence of \"Taiwanese literature,\" especially the creation and intellectualization of Taiwanese literature, she does not believe that it is \"the result of a temporary, one-party, or political operation,\" but instead that it has its causes and profound significance. In an article, she mentioned: \"The canonization of Taiwanese literary works and the discipline of Taiwanese studies are cultural phenomena that can be objectively analyzed. This cultural phenomenon has long and profound social roots, reflecting our society's power and desire to express collective emotions and understand our land and history.\"\nShe is very concerned about the problems of \"Taiwan usually has only one or a few representatives participating,\" \"weak numbers,\" and \"lack of a generational team.\" She believes this phenomenon will eventually affect the voice of Taiwanese and Taiwanese literature in the international academic community and create a disadvantage in academic inheritance and international competition for the next generation.\nRegarding the development of Taiwanese literary research, Liu Shuqin believes that thinking about \"what Taiwanese literature can give back to society\" is more important and urgent than \"discussing research topics and research methods in detail.\" At the \"Current Issues in Taiwanese Literature Symposium\" held by the Taiwan Research Center of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Providence University, the National Museum of Taiwanese Literature, the Taiwan Research Center platform, and relevant university departments and institutes were called upon to invite people from all walks of life to discuss the various changes that have occurred in the domestic cultural and educational fields in recent years through some means (such as a series of workshops) and to think about the various impacts these changes have brought to the discipline of, the social needs they reflect, and the strategies for responding to these changes.\nLiterary work\nArticles can be divided into \u201cacademic works\u201d and \u201cgeneral works\u201d.

    "Italian architect and engineer\nBenvenuto Francesco Pesce Maineri (Genoa, 1865 \u2013 Genoa, 1935) was an Italian architect, engineer, and urban planner, known for his contributions to the Art Nouveau and Eclecticism styles in Italy during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nBiography\nPalazzo at Via XX Settembre, No. 26, designed by Pesce-Maineri\nPalazzo at No. 36, Via XX Settembre, another work by Pesce-Maineri\nWorkers' housing by the \"Societ\u00e0 L\u2019Economica\", in the Staglieno district\nBenvenuto Francesco Pesce-Maineri was born in Genoa in 1865. He studied at the Royal Polytechnic of Milan, graduating in 1897. Engineer, architect, and professor, he had his studio at the central via XX Settembre 5-7 and, later, in Cornigliano, an elegant district with noble buildings, in Via Tonale and then at his own residence in Via Edomondo De Amicis 19. At the end of the nineteenth century, he was also active in journalism, writing for the monthly magazine L'edilizia moderna (Milan) by Luca Beltrami, for Il Monitore Tecnico by Achille Manfredini, and for the magazine Arte italiana decorativa e industriale by Camillo Boito. Since 1896, he became a member of the Societ\u00e0 ligure di storia patria. In 1903, he married Maria at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Grace in Tagliolo.\nPesce Maineri operated in the Ligurian capital at an important moment for the city when its layout was changing and large and relevant residential neighborhoods were emerging. He was mainly involved in the renewal of via XX Settembre, a street conceived following the dismantling of the ancient Via Giulia, designing some important buildings. As a member of the Societ\u00e0 ligure di storia patria, he designed the building at civic number 36, inspired by Venetian architecture, and that at civic number 26, a palace with maritime thematization with rich aquatic decoration and the colors, red and white, of the flag of Genoa. In 1904, he designed in the Staglieno district the building of the Workers' housing by the Societ\u00e0 L'Economica, commissioned by Gustavo Dufour, completed around 1907, a company that dealt with the construction of many popular buildings in the capital.\nHe also worked on the major urban revolutions that, starting from the lower part of via XX Settembre, which opens onto the area in front of the Genova Brignole railway station and the Bisagno river, reached Corso Italia. For twenty years, from 1897 to 1917, he proposed a long series of projects for the redevelopment of the area and the burial of the stream, until the approval of the 1917 project by the city council. The most significant transformation of this urban area, namely the covering of the Bisagno and the regulatory plan of the adjacent areas, was finally resolved in 1919 and completed in 1930. Among the most significant studies used for the implementation of the intervention was that of Benvenuto Pesce Maineri, as well as Gaetano Orzali, Renzo Picasso, Giuseppe Cannovale, and others. In Venice, he proposed to the council an extensive project for the complete urbanization of the Sant'Elena island. He also designed the plan for a basilica \"Salvator Mundi in memoriam Cristofori Columbi inanuensis\", which was supposed to be built near the Scalinata delle Caravelle in the area called \"spianata Bisagno\", in what would later become Piazza della Vittoria, in Genoa.\nAs a Dominican tertiary, in Savona, he drafted the project for the redevelopment of the municipal cemetery. He was also the designer of the Castello di Quassolo, in Carcare.\nHe was an esteemed academician at the Accademia Ligustica di Belle Arti for the architecture class.\nIn his old age, he was part of the diocesan commission for sacred art with other known architects of the time like Lorenzo Basso. He died in Genoa in 1935.\nStyle\nBenvenuto Pesce's style reflects the eclecticism typical of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In his works, the theme of water recurs as almost a personal signature, becoming an integral part of the architecture itself. For example, the building at civic number 36 of via XX Settembre in Genoa, characterized by Venetian style, has an aquatic component linked to the lagoon and marsh environment: the decorations of the building mainly feature intricate river vegetation, carp, and water birds.\nCivic number 26, characterized by a more mature and less academic style, has the sea water as its main theme: spiral algae motifs repeated on the facade and as a constituent element of the anterids, Leviathans that become finishing elements of the arches and uprights of the internal railings, dolphins, and mythological motifs: what distinguishes the building is above all the large bas-relief of the god Neptune adorning the upper part of the entrance door. Pesce also favored the use of warm colors, as well as the frequent reference to the white-red combination, probably a reference to the color of the Genoa flag.\nNotable works\nPalazzo at via XX Settembre 26, Genoa\nPalazzo at via XX Settembre 36, Genoa\nWorkers' housing in St",

Ciudad Pedro de Alvarado is on the CA-2 Highway, which stretches across the south of the country, and connects it to its closest major town, Chiquimulilla, 26\u00a0km away. It is 21\u00a0km away from the municipal capital of Moyuta, and 51\u00a0km from Jutiapa, the capital of its department. Ciudad Pedro de Alvarado is 97\u00a0km from the national capital, Guatemala City, and 15\u00a0km from the Pacific Ocean.\nThe town is named after Pedro de Alvarado.\nTransport\nThe busiest crossing by number of passengers from Guatemala to El Salvador is the CA-1, which is a part of the Pan-American Highway. However, the CA-2 which Ciudad Pedro de Alvarado is on carries the highest net weight of land transport of goods, amounting to 30% of the bilateral transport between the two countries.\nThe narrow Puente La Hachadura carrying CA-2 across the Paz River is reported to be too narrow, and suffers from flooding under heavy rain. As a result, It was announced by the El Salvadoran Minister of Public Works and Transport in late 2020 that a new bridge, the Puente Manuel Jos\u00e9 Arce, is to be built. The bridge is to be 160 m long, with 4 lanes and an access road of 1.4\u00a0km. US$30 million (230 million Guatemalan quetzal) was invested in the project. Construction began in November 2021.\nIn February 2024, in response to the high rate of road accidents in the area, an initiative was launched to educate the population on road safety.\nDemographics\nIn 2018, the population of Ciudad Pedro de Alvarado was 2795. As is the trend for the vicinity, a majority, 94% of inhabitants were Ladino people, and 4% were Xinca.\nClimate\nCiudad Pedro de Alvarado has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen: Aw).\n",
    "Chazan, Cantor, Composer, Zionist Activist (July 21, 1866-June 16, 1932)\nAbraham Moshe Bernstein (July 21, 1866 \u2013 June 16, 1932) was a distinguished Chazan and composer. He was among the Chazanim who made an effort to revive the ancient melodies in place of Western Jewish music that had been incorporated into sacred services and had become contaminated with Christian melodies. In 1927, he released a compilation of Jewish folk tunes from Eastern Europe.\nDespite his significant contributions to modern Cantorial music, his name remains relatively unknown today, even among Chazanut aficionados, largely because he left no audio recordings.\nEarly Life\nBorn on Tisha B'Av in 1866 in the small town of Shatsk, located in what was then White Russia, Bernstein grew up in an ultra-orthodox household. By the age of nine, he had already gained considerable knowledge of Gemara. At the age of ten, he made the bold decision to leave Shatzk and journey to Minsk to pursue his studies at Yeshiva there.\nWhile there, the esteemed Chazan of Minsk, Israel Minsker, accepted Bernstein into his choir as a chorister. However, feeling out of place among the other choristers due to their coarse behavior, he decided to leave.\nBernstein then moved to the Mir Yeshiva (Belarus), where he studied for two years. After his time in Mir, he traveled from town to town, eventually arriving in Kovno. There, inspired by a deep desire to daven and sing, he met the renowned Kovner Chazan, Raphael Judah Rabinowitch, who became his mentor and close friend.\nCareer\nWhen Bernstein was twenty-two years old in 1888, he was appointed Chazan in Bialystok\u2019s \"Adat Yeshurun\" synagogue. He stayed there for eighteen months before moving on to become Choirmaster of the Great Synagogue of Riga, Latvia, where the illustrious Chazan Baruch Leib Rosowsky (1841\u20131919), presided.\nIn 1893, Bernstein accepted the Chazanship of the Vilna \"Chor-Shul,\" also referred to as the \"Taharat Hakodesh\u201d. He served in that capacity for thirty years. It was the only synagogue in Vilnius not destroyed during the Holocaust, and still stands today.\nZionist Activism\nIn 1899, Bernstein became actively involved in the clandestine B'nei Moshe organization, led by Ahad HaAm. This movement attracted a wide range of young intellectuals, from Yeshiva students to university scholars, and emerged as a significant presence in the Jewish community. It stirred a strong sense of national pride, aiming to foster a deep love for Zion and a profound appreciation for Jewish heritage among the youth, and rejected the idea of submitting to the challenges imposed by their Gentile surroundings.\nNotable Works\nBernstein wrote a large body of work that was collected into three volumes called \"Avodat Haboreh.\" Additionally, he edited the \"Musikalisher Pinkus,\" which is a compilation of Chassidic and Zemirot melodies as well as several Hebrew and Yiddish \"lieder,\" including the well-known pieces \"Zamd un Shtern\" (words by Frug) and \"Hemerel, Hemerl, Kiap\" (words by Raizen).\nOne of his most well-known compositions is \"Yismechu v'malchuscho\" for Cantor and Choir, which was a part of the repertoire of Europe's most illustrious synagogues before the Holocaust.\nDeath\nHe died on the tenth of Sivan in 1932, at the age of 66.\n",

For the Universal Studios theme park ride, see Revenge of the Mummy.\nThe Mummy Theme Park is a 2000 English-language Italian horror adventure film directed, produced and co-written by Alvaro Passeri. The film's plot centers around an underground amusement park in Egypt built on the tomb of a pharaoh, and an ancient curse that leads to the park's animatronic mummies being brought back to life and wreaking havoc.\nPlot\nNekhebet, a descendent of Cleopatra named after the ancient Egyptian goddess, wishes to revive the ancient culture, religion, and monarchical government of Egypt in the modern day. She prays to the gods Osiris and Ra, causing an earthquake that opens a deep fissure in the Egyptian desert, leading to the discovery of a subterranean necropolis with a tomb belonging to a pharaoh who once ruled both Upper and Lower Egypt. Lecherous businessman Sheik El Sahid orders that the tomb be opened, in spite of his associate Professor Mason reading hieroglyphics which warn of an ancient curse that will be unleashed if the tomb is disturbed. El Sahid converts the site into an underground amusement park known as the Mummy Theme Park, and invites American photographer Daniel Flynn and his assistant Julie to visit and publicise the venture.\nDaniel and Julie arrive at El Sahid's palace, where they are shown to their bedrooms by Nekhebet, who works with El Sahid despite refusing his lustful advances towards her. After being offended by Julie's ignorance of Egyptian culture, Nekhebet beseeches Osiris to enact vengeance on Julie and Daniel. Daniel awakes to a souvenir wrapped in papyrus being thrown through the window of his room. The next day, El Sahid takes Daniel and Julie on a behind-the-scenes tour of the Mummy Theme Park, where they see ancient Egyptian mummies being augmented with animatronic parts and microchips which allow park personnel to control the mummies from a monitoring room. Daniel and Julie join El Sahid on an educational train ride about daily life in ancient Egypt. One of El Sahid's guardsmen learns that Nekhebet is seeking to sabotage the park; she becomes aware of this and prays to Osiris, resulting in the guard violently transforming into a snake.\nSome time later, Daniel brings the papyrus thrown through his window to Professor Mason, who translates hieroglyphics inscribed on it as a warning describing the ancient curse and stating that the park's existence offends the memory of the pharaohs. Nekhebet activates one of the robotically enhanced mummies, who arms himself with a sword and kills several of El Sahid's guardsmen before disappearing through a portal. Daniel and Julie take photographs of the different scenes featured on the educational ride, including an area where riders meet the pharaoh in whose tomb the park was built. The flash of Daniel's camera causes the microchip in the pharaoh-mummy's head to malfunction, and the pharaoh begins chasing Daniel and Julie through the ride.\nThe pharaoh corners Julie and Daniel, but is distracted by Julie's breasts, allowing Daniel to grab a nearby container of acid and pour it onto the pharaoh, causing his wraps and skin to dissolve. His skeleton continues chasing Daniel and Julie, but Daniel crushes it with a large rock. El Sahid's guardsmen find Daniel and Julie, restrain them, and bring them to El Sahid, who apologizes to them for the pharaoh-mummy running amok. The following day, El Sahid stages a photoshoot with himself, the pharaoh-mummy, and Professor Mason, but Nekhebet arrives and calls upon the Egyptian gods to reseal the fissure in which the park was built. As the ride begins to collapse, other mummies awaken and kill several more of El Sahid's guardsmen as well as Professor Mason. \nJulie hacks into the park's computer system using her laptop, and she and Daniel escape on one of the park's trains. El Sahid is encased in mummy wraps while still alive, and Nekhebet, having overheard Daniel expressing sympathy towards her view of the Mummy Theme Park as an affront to the pharaohs, bids him and Julie farewell. Once above ground, Daniel and Julie kiss, and Nekhebet is seen sitting and cuddling with a pharaoh.\nCast\nAdam O'Neil as Daniel Flynn\nHolly Laningham as Julie\nCyrus Elias\u00a0 as Sheik\nHelen Preest as Nekhebet\nPeter Boom\u00a0 as Professor Mason\nReception\nIn 2014, Milwaukee Public Museum curator and anthropologist Carter Lupton listed The Mummy Theme Park as being among a number of \"amateurish efforts\" belonging to the subgenre of mummy films. The following year, author Clive Davies wrote that, \"This bizarre, ultra-low budget horror adventure (comedy?) has some real laughable sets and FX, but on the other hand has some oddly effective moments that make you think that the filmmakers have their tongues firmly in cheek.\" In 2024, author Bryan Senn referred to The Mummy Theme Park as \" execrable Westworld wannabe\".\n",
    "Park in Kota, India\nSeven Wonders Park is a tourist destination located in the city of Kota, Rajasthan, India. The park has replicas of the so-called \"new seven wonders of the world,\" making it a destination for both locals and tourists.\nHistory\nThe idea of Seven Wonders Park was conceived by the Urban Improvement Trust of Kota as part of an initiative to boost tourism and provide a recreational space in the city. The park was officially inaugurated on December 8, 2013, by the then Rajasthan Urban Development and Housing Minister Shanti Dhariwal. The project was executed under the supervision of the Kota Municipal Corporation and aimed to offer visitors a glimpse of world-famous monuments in a single location.\nDesign and construction\nThe park was designed by architect Anoop Bartaria. The construction involved extensive research to ensure that the replicas closely resembled the original monuments. Traditional stone artisans were brought in from across Rajasthan, including Bharatpur, Dholpur and Agra, to build the replicas and over 150 workers worked at a fast pace for over a year and a half to complete the project. It cost an estimated \u20b920 crore (US$2.4\u00a0million) to build. The park is spread over an area of about seven acres and includes landscaped gardens, water bodies and walking paths.\nFeatures\nSeven Wonders Park features scaled-down replicas of the following seven wonders of the world:\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza (Egypt)\nThe only surviving structure of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. This replica is made of stone and is high enough to give visitors a view of it.\nChrist the Redeemer (Brazil)\nThis replica captures the statue of Jesus Christ with outstretched arms located in Rio de Janeiro. It is made from reinforced concrete and stands on a pedestal similar to the original.\nEiffel Tower (France)\nA night view of replica of Eiffel tower at park\nA scaled-down version of the famous Parisian landmark, constructed using iron, much like the original. The replica is illuminated at night, offering a bright view.\nLeaning Tower of Pisa (Italy)\nA view of replica of Leaning Tower of Pisa at park\nKnown for its unintended tilt, this replica is crafted to mimic the structural lean, complete with the cylindrical shape and detailed masonry work.\nStatue of Liberty (USA)\nA view of replica of Statue of Liberty at park\nThis statue replica is made from fiber-reinforced plastic and stands on a pedestal, a replica of the monument located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor.\nTaj Mahal (India)\nA view of replica of Tajmahal at park\nThis replica of the Taj Mahal in Agra offers a glimpse of Mughal architecture and is made of white marble.\nColosseum (Italy)\nA view of replica of Colosseum at park\nThis replica of the ancient amphitheater in Rome is constructed using concrete and stone, showcasing the iconic arches and elliptical shape.\nReception\nJharokha at Park\nSince its inauguration, the Seven Wonders Park has contributed significantly to the local tourism industry. It has attracted visitors from various parts of India and abroad, boosting the local economy and giving Kota fame as a tourist destination.\nSince it opened, more than 25 lakh people have visited the Seven Wonders Park so far. On an average, 30,000 people visit it every month. Some visitors have complained about lack of maintenance at the park.\nOn the lines of Kota, another Seven Wonders Park has been built in New Delhi which is located between Sarai Kale Khan and Millennium Park.\nIn popular culture\nThe Hindi cinema film Badrinath Ki Dulhania was shot at various locations in Kota including this park.\nSee also\nKishore Sagar Talab\nTaragarh Fort, Bundi\n",
    "English footballer\nWilliam Brian Linighan (17 May 1936\u00a0\u2013 24 May 2004) was an English professional footballer who played as a central defender. He started his senior career at Lincoln City, but never completed a senior appearance. He spent time on loan at Birmingham & District League club Oswestry Town in 1957\u201358 and at Football League Fourth Division club Darlington in 1958, for whom he scored on his only appearance in the Football League. The following year he signed for Ashington of the Midland League, where he spent two seasons before moving on to teams including Wingate Colliery Welfare and Blackhall Colliery Welfare.\nPersonal life\nWilliam Brian Linighan was born on 17 May 1936 in Hartlepool, County Durham. He was married to Olwyn, and the couple had six children, five sons and a daughter. Three sons became professional footballers, all defenders: Andy and David each made nearly 600 appearances at Football League level, and Brian junior played briefly for Sheffield Wednesday and Bury before moving into non-League football. Linighan died in Hartlepool on 24 May 2004.\nFootball career\nLinighan played as a centre half for the St Joseph's club in West Hartlepool and represented Durham County at youth level. Together with fellow 17-year-old and Durham youth team-mate Tom Burlison, he joined Football League Second Division club Lincoln City on amateur forms in October 1953. Both turned professional in early December, moved up from the \"A\" team to the reserves, who played in the Midland League, and were retained at the end of the season.\nLinighan began his National Service in the 64th Training Regiment Royal Artillery early in the 1955\u201356 season, which limited his availability for Lincoln, although he did play football for Services' teams. He returned to his club in November 1956 out of form, and a couple of weeks later he joined a Birmingham League club, Oswestry Town, on loan.\nLinighan was a regular in Lincoln's Midland League team in 1957\u201358, chosen at right back as well as his usual centre half, and at the beginning of March 1958, when the club's shortage of forwards became acute, he was tried at centre forward for the reserves. He scored in each of his first two appearances in that position, and after the club were unable to complete the signings of two forwards from Leicester City in time for the Second Division match against Cardiff City on 8 March, he was selected at centre forward for the first team, set \"the unenviable task of leading a line which has not been notable for its success in scoring goals.\" Lincoln were 3\u20130 down at half-time, but heavy snowfall forced the referee to abandon the match without resuming for the second half, so what would have been Linighan's Football League debut does not appear in the records.\nIn October 1958, Linighan signed for Football League Fourth Division club Darlington  In October 1958, Linighan's home-town club, Hartlepools United of the Football League Fourth Division, were hoping to take the player on a free transfer, but the local newspaper expected \"that Darlington would be prepared to top any offer Pools might make for the player\". He duly signed for Darlington for what was described as a small fee, and made his Football League debut on 8 November away to Workington. With his new team 3\u20131 down, Linighan was switched from centre half to the forward line and scored a late equaliser in a 3\u20133 draw. He did not appear again, and returned to Lincoln \"by agreement between the clubs\" a few days later.\nLinighan finally left Lincoln in February 1959 when he signed for Midland League club Ashington. He was still there in September 1961, and went on to play for Wingate Colliery Welfare and Blackhall Colliery Welfare.\n",
    "Species of lichen\nMelanelixia albertana is a species of corticolous (bark-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. First described in 1969 from collections made in Alberta, Canada, it has undergone two taxonomic reclassifications before ultimately being placed in the genus Melanelixia in 2004. The species is characterised by the soralia on the margins of its lobes, a feature that is rare in brown parmelioid lichens. This feature is reflected in its common name, powder-rimmed camouflage lichen. Melanelixia albertana has an unusual Asian-North American disjunct distribution. The widespread presence of Melanelixia albertana across different regions is attributed to the similar climatic and vegetative conditions found in the northern parts of the interior prairies in North America, as well as in the forest steppe and ultracontinental taiga forests of northern Mongolia, Transbaikal, and Yakutia. It occurs in river valley and ravine systems, as well as aspen parkland.\nTaxonomy\nIt was first described as a new species in 1969 by the Finnish lichenologist Teuvo Ahti, who classified it in the genus Parmelia. The type specimen was collected by Ahti on the southwest tip of Alberta's Big Lake, where it was found in a poplar forest growing on Populus balsamifera. In 1978, Ted Esslinger reclassified the taxon, transferring it to the genus Melanelia as part of his reorganization of the brown parmelioid species. The taxon was finally transferred to genus Melanelixia in 2004, after molecular phylogenetics analysis showed that Melanelia was not monophyletic, instead falling into four different clades.\nMelanelixia albertana was part of a 2016 phylogenetic analysis that investigated evolutionary relationships within the Melanohalea clade. This study, which included complete concatenated alignments of internal transcribed spacer and mitochondrial small subunit DNA sequences, revealed that Melanelixia albertana forms a monophyletic group within the genus Melanelixia, albeit with moderate bootstrap support (53%). The analysis also uncovered that the clade 'Melanelixia albertana' includes specimens identified as multiple nominal taxa from various regions, such as M.\u00a0villosella from China, M.\u00a0glabra from China and northern India, and two specimens from the Russian Far East.\nThe species-level clade named 'M.\u00a0albertana' comprised specimens morphologically similar to M.\u00a0albertana, including samples from the northern Great Plains of North America, China, Russia, and India. These findings indicate that Melanelixia albertana is a polymorphic species with a broad geographic distribution that includes high-elevation sites in Asia (China, India, and Russia) and lower elevation sites in North America. The study suggests that additional molecular sequence data are necessary to confirm species boundaries and propose formal taxonomic changes for the group.\nThe marginal soralia of Melanelixia albertana are a characteristic feature of this species, and otherwise rare in brown parmelioid lichens. This prominent character is reflected in its common name, the \"powder-rimmed camouflage lichen\".\nDescription\nMelanelixia albertana from Altai Territory, Russia; scale bar = 5 mm\nMelanelixia albertana loosely attaches to tree bark, forming a thallus (lichen body) that is 4\u201310\u00a0cm (1.6\u20133.9\u00a0in) wide. The colour of the thallus surface ranges from dark greenish-brown to red-brown. The lobes are rounded at the tips, 3\u20134\u00a0mm wide, and have irregular, crenulate (scalloped) edges with ascending sorediate lobes (lobes covered with powdery reproductive propagules). The upper surface is typically wrinkled, dull to somewhat shiny near the lobe ends, and lacks pseudocyphellae (tiny pores).\nThe lower surface is black with a smooth brown marginal rim, and features rhizines (root-like structures) that are the same colour. Soralia (clusters of soredia) are numerous, labriform (lip-shaped), and contain coarsely granular soredia that are partly white and partly dark brown. The lobes are 180\u2013240\u00a0\u03bcm thick, with an upper cortex (outer layer) of 5\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm, an algal layer of 45\u201360\u00a0\u03bcm, a medulla (middle layer) of 120\u2013150\u00a0\u03bcm, and a lower cortex of 10\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm.\nApothecia (fruiting bodies) and pycnidia (asexual reproductive structures) have not been observed to occur in this species. Chemical spot tests show that the medulla reacts C+ (red) and contains lecanoric acid.\nHabitat and distribution\nMelanelixia albertana is an epiphyte that grows in river valley and ravine systems, as well as aspen parkland. It occasionally appears in boreal regions, particularly in mature mixed to deciduous forests. Favoured tree species in North America include deciduous trees and shrubs, particularly Salix and Populus. In Mongolia, it favours the native Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila) and the shrub Spiraea aquilegifolia.\nThe global distribution of Melanelixia albertana mirrors the climatic and vegetative similarities between the northern edge of the interior prairies of North America and the forest ste",
    "United Kingdom parliamentary choir\nThe Parliament Choir, also known as the UK Parliament Choir and the Choir of the UK Parliament, is the choir of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Founded by Simon Over with the support of Geoffrey Filkin, Baron Filkin in December 2000, it is made up of members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords and staff who work at Parliament.\nFounding\nThe Parliament Choir, also known as UK Parliament Choir and the Choir of the UK Parliament, was founded in December 2000 by composer Simon Over with the support of Geoffrey Filkin, Baron Filkin. Over had run a choral society at Westminster Abbey whose members included serving parliamentarians in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. These parliamentarians were often unable to attend rehearsals because of voting commitments and the late hours of parliamentary business. Over discussed the issue with Filkin who proposed establishing a choir in Parliament to address the issue. Over then set up a choir in the Palace of Westminster, the Parliament Choir, which enabled parliamentarians to attend votes at short notice with the sounding of the division bell during rehearsals, returning to rehearse shortly after the vote had concluded. The choir performed for the first time in December 2000.\nOrganisation\nThe Parliament Choir was initially organised as an all-party parliamentary group within Parliament. As such, the choir could only rehearse when Parliament was in session. Since its early years, it has been sponsored by BT Group, which gives it around \u00a360,000 or \u00a365,000 to maintain the choir every year. The choir's internal relationship with Parliament was changed in 2017, after it had to cancel a concert when it was unexpectedly dissolved as part of the dissolution of Parliament for the snap 2017 general election. It is now an autonomous body of Parliament under the patronage of the Speaker of the House of Commons (Lindsay Hoyle since 2019) and the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords (John McFall, Baron McFall of Alcluith since 2021) who serve as its co-presidents.\nThe Parliament Choir is legally organised as a registered charity and a company limited by guarantee. It is managed by a board of trustees which is led by a chair and also includes three vice-chairs and a treasurer. Mike German, Baron German is the chair of the choir. Hugh Merrill, Bernard Jenkin and Mary Macleod are the vice-chairs. Judith Jolly, Baroness Jolly is the treasurer. Other trustees include Oliver Heald, Sue Hayman, Baroness Hayman of Ullock and Michael Prisk. The choir also has a music team which includes Simon Over as music director and Nicholas O'Neill as choirmaster and composer in residence. Southbank Sinfonia serves as the choir's resident orchestra; the orchestra was also founded by Simon Over in 2002.\nMembership\nSince its founding, the choir has upheld a policy of keeping its membership open to anyone who has a parliamentary pass or works in the Palace of Westminster; membership is open to all parliamentary staff including police and security personnel, caterers and transcribers for Hansard, as well as to journalists with access to the press gallery and parliamentarians from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, including senior government ministers. Members of Parliament (MPs) have also invited their constituents to join the choir. Auditions are not required to join the choir; anyone who wishes to join may do so. However, there is a membership fee ranging from \u00a360 to \u00a3120 depending on members' salaries. Membership is cross-party and its members have included Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians.\nLords\nThe following Lords or former Lords have been members of the Parliament Choir at some point during their careers.\nAlastair Bruce, 5th Baron Aberdare\nRobin Bridgeman, 3rd Viscount Bridgeman\nMike German, Baron German\nGeoffrey Filkin, Baron Filkin\nSimon Arthur, 4th Baron Glenarthur\nSue Hayman, Baroness Hayman of Ullock\nJudith Jolly, Baroness Jolly\nDavid Lea, Baron Lea of Crondall\nGenista McIntosh, Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall\nWilf Stevenson, Baron Stevenson of Balmacara\nMartin Thomas, Baron Thomas of Gresford\nWilliam Wallace, Baron Wallace of Saltaire\nJoan Walmsley, Baroness Walmsley\nPatricia Hollis, Baroness Hollis of Heigham\nJean Corston, Baroness Corston\nPaul Strasburger, Baron Strasburger\nMPs\nThe following MPs or former MPs have been members of the Parliament Choir at some point during their careers.\nAlun Michael\nDavid Lammy\nBernard Jenkin\nHelen Jackson\nJeremy Lefroy\nDavid Lidington\nMary Macleod\nDavid Madel\nFiona Mactaggart\nMark Prisk\nCaroline Spelman\nAlan Beith\nRobert Jackson\nSarah Teather\nEd Miliband\nNick Clegg\nJohn Bercow\n",

    "Football club\nUnion 1861 Sch\u00f6nebeck e. V. is a multi-sport club and the largest sports club in the city of Sch\u00f6nebeck and the Salzlandkreis district in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.\nHistory\nThe history of Union Sch\u00f6nebeck dates back to the M\u00e4nner-Turn-Verein (MTV 1861) founded on 12 September 1861. The MTV 1861 initially had 42 members (men only). In 1886, the \"Free Gymnastics Association\" was formed as a workers' gymnastics club. In 1905, a women's department was established. In 1930, a new sports ground with a clubhouse was built on Magdeburger Strasse (the current stadium site). In 1934, the Turn and Sports Association of 1861 Bad Salzelmen (TSVg) was founded.\nUntil the end of the World War II, the club was based in the Salzelmen district. After the post-war ban on associations by the Soviet occupation authorities and the restriction of sports competitions to the local level, several loosely organized sports communities were formed in Sch\u00f6nebeck in 1946, which were later transformed into factory sports clubs (BSG). The occupation authorities allowed the following clubs in Sch\u00f6nebeck:\nAltstadt (predecessor of BSG Motor)\nNeustadt (predecessor of BSG Chemie)\nFrohse\nFelgeleben\nSalzelmen\nWith the political change of 1989, the previous sponsoring companies could no longer provide support under the new economic conditions. The BSGs were transformed into registered clubs.

    "Fictional character from Heavenly Delusion\nFictional character\nKiruko (Japanese: \u30ad\u30eb\u30b3) is a fictional character the manga series Heavenly Delusion created by Masakazu Ishiguro. Kiruko is the protagonist of the series alongside her partner Maru whom she has to bodyguard around Japan to reach an area labeled as Heaven. The character's true identity is Haruki Takehaya (\u7af9\u65e9 \u6625\u5e0c, Takehaya Haruki), an orphan raised by his sister Kiriko and had his brain transplanted to her body in order to survive after suffering severe wounds against a \"man-eater\" creature. Both Kiruko and Maru are able to defeat these creatures with Kiruko relying on her \"Kiru-Beam\" (\u30ad\u30eb\u5149\u7dda, Kiru K\u014dsen), a super powered gun that was given by Maru's caretaker before the series begins. Kiruko's journey also involves meeting the doctor behind the brain transplant to learn the reason behind Kiriko's death and his survival.\nKiruko was created by Ishiguro inspired by stories of brother and sisters, aiming to write one where they swapped bodies. However, in contrast to previous stories he read, he wanted Kiruko's body change to be written in a more realistic manner. In the anime adaptation of Heavenly Delusion, Kiruko was voiced by Sayaka Senbongi in Japanese and Anjali Kunapaneni in English. Critical response to Kiruko was positive for the seriousness portrayal to her gender identity as well as bond with Maru as they form an appealing relationship that acts as a counterpart to parallel stories involving other students from Heaven.\nCreation\nScrapped design of Kiruko in the Monthly Comic Ry\u016b magazine.\nMasakazu Ishiguro does not remember exactly when the idea came to that a girl's body contained the brain of her younger brother, but it was a series of sound considerations from which he understood that this is the story he wanted to tell. He has always been inspired by stories of brothers and sisters, so he wanted to create his own story about a brother and sister swapping places, where the brother takes care of the sister. He rejected coincidences related to magic and wanted to create a more realistic and accurate world to show what happens during a brain transplant. He was also against the idea of a man turning into a woman leading to perverted jokes about cleavage and lacking a penis. Instead, with Kiruko, he wanted the scenario to be more realistic. Another theme involves how relationships would change if somebody's sex changed. He often writes metaphorical situations with Kiruko's menstrual cycle being caused by clashing with Maru's lips when awakening from an hallucination from a Hiruko's attack. The sibling-like dynamic of the duo of Maru and Miruko was based on Ishiguro's personal life. He was inspired by an event when he noticed a person who was interested in his sister. Another aspect of the protagonists' dynamic was inspired by buddy films. In the beginning, Maru has feelings for Kiruko without knowing that his bodyguard is a man inside a girl's body. Ishiguro called this premise as \"transsexual sci-fi\", alluding to the possibility of Maru still loving Kiruko despite knowing the truth. When asked about the portrayal of the protagonist, Ishiguro saaid Kiruko a represents a gradation of spiritual sexuality.\nKiruko's design changed from original previews as Ishiguro drew her in the Monthly Comic Ry\u016b manga magazine. There the design had a different hair color and hairstyle. Ishiguro was experimenting to see what it would look like on the cover of a magazine if this manga was actually serialized. The female characters in Soremachi tend to be restrained from getting too carried away with their hobbies, so even if they are actually in front of the author, Ishiguro found them friendly. On the other hand, Kiruko was written to be based on Ishiguro's type of woman. When drawing Kiruko, Ishiguro enjoys illustrating her face, most notably, the line that is created by the hollows under the eyes and the step of the cheekbones. He always thought that this is an area that cannot be expressed in a drawing. But when it comes to drawing a woman he likes, Ishiguro feels like he has to work hard on that. The step between the cheeks and the eye sockets is more expressed by the angle compared to when viewed from the front. Besides enjoying her hairstyle, Ishiguro summed up that the design came from his ideal older sister style. While not meant to be taken sexually, Ishiguro visualized the series by thinking of the concept of a man living with an older woman whom he regards as an attractive person he like an older sister.\nWriter Makoto Fukami noted the constant banters between Kiruko and Maru important for the plot setting so they avoided trimming them. The director got the impression that Maru meets Kiruko from a place where he does not know his own past, and gradually gains an ego. On the other hand, Kiruko is in a complicated situation with Maru, and has a past that is too heavy for her to handle alone. As a result, he enjoys the two and thinks it is a mutually complem",

    "Oldest known male sea otter\nAdaa was a male sea otter at the Seattle Aquarium, known for being the oldest male sea otter on record at 22 years and eight months. Male sea otters in the wild typically live between 10 and 15 years, while females average 15\u201320 years.\nEarly life\nAdaa was estimated to be seven months old when he was discovered suffering from hypothermia on a remote airport runway in Port Heiden, Alaska. He received emergency care at the Alaska SeaLife Center, where he was named Adaa, an Aleut word meaning \"come ashore.\" He was then transferred to the Oregon Coast Aquarium, where he lived until April 2004, when he was moved to the Seattle Aquarium.\nAppearance, habits and care\nAdaa was known for his gentle demeanor towards both the female otters and his human handlers. He would hop on his rear flippers while on land and make soft cooing sounds while chewing. His favorite pastimes included crunching on ice and solving puzzle feeders. After the passing of his mate Aniak, he was often seen grooming and holding onto Mishka, Seattle Aquarium's youngest female otter, while he slept.\nFamily\nAdaa sired two pups with Aniak, who was born in captivity in 2002 to Lootas, Seattle Aquarium's oldest otter until her death in November 2020. Aniak passed away in June 2021.\nTheir first pup, Chugach, a male, was transferred to Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, where he predeceased Adaa. The second pup, Sekiu, a female, was the last sea otter born in captivity before the Association of Zoos and Aquariums discontinued the otter breeding program to focus resources on rescuing stranded pups.\nThe aquarium's three generations of otters were highly affectionate with each other. When Lootas returned from a 5-month stay at the Oregon Zoo, she was enthusiastically greeted by Adaa. Adaa was reunited with his daughter Sekiu in December 2021, a few months before his death. Sekiu is alive and remains one of Seattle Aquarium's featured otters.\nDeath\nIn mid-February 2022, Adaa was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He was so trusting of his human handlers that he allowed them to take X-rays and samples of the fluids that had rounded his abdomen. During his last days, Adaa was treated to his favorite foods, such as Dungeness crab and Atlantic surf clam, in addition to his favorite ice to crunch. Despite being given oral steroids to suppress the cancerous cells, his condition rapidly deteriorated and he was humanely euthanized on February 27.\nA children's book about Adaa's rescue and subsequent aquarium life, Adaa\u2019s Story: The Remarkable Life of a Rescued Sea Otter, was written and illustrated by Rachel J.E. Sprague in collaboration with the Seattle Aquarium and Alaska SeaLife Center.\n",

    "Municipal building in St Austell, Cornwall, England\nSt Austell Market House is a municipal building in St Austell, a town in Cornwall, in England. The structure, which accommodates a series of boutique shops, is a Grade II* listed building.\nHistory\nThe interior of the building, in 2016\nThe first market house in St Austell was an ancient building commissioned by the Mays family in 1638. A second town hall was erected in 1791, but by the early 1840s, it was considered too small. One of the last meetings in the old market hall was organised by Isaac Latimer of Truro, the agent for the Colonisation Commissioners for South Australia, in August 1839, to encourage impoverished local people to emigrate to South Australia.\nThe site that civic leaders selected for the new market hall was occupied by the King's Arms Inn. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the lord of the manor, Charles Graves-Sawle, of Penrice House, in 1842. It was designed by Christopher Eales in the Italianate style, built by Oliver Stone & Sons of Falmouth in granite from Trethurgy at a cost of \u00a37,000, and was completed in 1844.\nIn the front section of the building, there was a vaulted entrance hall on the ground floor and there was a large assembly room on the first floor, which served as St Austell Town Hall.  The ground floor of the main market hall behind provided space for stalls for the sale of farm produce at the front, and for the sale of meat in the centre.  The first floor of the main market hall hosted stalls selling fruit, vegetables, poultry, butter, and general goods.  A gallery above the rear of the first floor initially served as a corn exchange.  The complex also accommodated two police cells.\nThe magistrates swore in 90 special constables in the town hall as they planned their response to the St Austell bread riots, during which local labourers looted the local bread shops, in June 1847. The high sheriff, Nicholas Kendall, who was supported by a detachment from the 5th (Northumberland Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot, read the riot act outside the building and 14 members of the public were arrested before the crowd dispersed.\nThe former Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone, addressed a large crowd about Home Rule in the building in June 1889, and the future Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, gave a speech about free trade there in January 1910. Although the market house was a regular venue for public meetings, after an urban district council was formed in 1894, municipal offices were established in Truro Road.\nThe town hall on the first floor was used as a cinema during the First World War.  After the war, it became a dance hall, and a sprung wooden floor was installed.  Later in the 20th century, it became the regional headquarters of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, then Evans' Hardware Store.  The gallery spent some time as a fire station.\nSt Austell Market Common Interest Company, established in 2007, acquired ownership of the complex in 2008. A limited programme of restoration works costing \u00a3180,000, involving the restoration of the arches and floors in the vaulted entrance hall, was completed in January 2022. The owners have confirmed plans to refurbish the roof, and to re-open the town hall as a community events space.\nArchitecture\nThe building is constructed of granite, with slate roofs. It has a large and irregular plan, but is broadly five bays wide and three bays deep.  The main frontage, facing onto Market Street, is symmetrical and vermiculated on the ground floor. It features five openings, the centre of which is rounded headed and the rest are segmental headed, all with keystones and voussoirs. The first floor is fenestrated by five round headed sash windows with window sills. The quoins are also vermiculated and, at roof level, the eaves are heavily modillioned. Internally, the front section is vaulted on the ground floor, and the town hall above has a sprung wooden floor. Behind the front section, there are lean-to shops in the main market hall, which is open on three sides at first floor level. The roof, which is supported by cast iron columns, may have been the largest single-span wooden roof in Europe when built.\nThe building is described by Historic England as \"one of the best market halls in the country, with good elevations and an exciting interior\".  It was grade II* listed in 1974.\nSee also\nGrade II* listed buildings in Cornwall (H\u2013P)\n",

    "\nThe 2001 Haitian coup attempt, involving around 30\u201380 armed gunmen part of the disbanded armed forces, was a foiled attempt at overthrowing President Jean Bertrand Aristide in Haiti. Following the coup attempt, partisans part of the ruling Fanmi Lavalas party and supporters of President Aristide reacted by engaging in widespread violence across the country, targeting opposition figures and journalists. The period of chaos was characterized by attacks, pillaging, and arson. Opposition parties accused the president of using the purported coup attempt as pretext to quell dissent. The violence against the press caused some 15 journalists to seek asylum abroad and as many as 40 to go into hiding. The coup attempt and ensuing chaos resulted in at least 13 deaths.\nCoup\nAt 3\u00a0am on December 17, 2001, local radio stations reported an attack on the National Palace, describing it as a commando-style assault. Three hours later, Jacques Maurice, a government spokesman, publicly announced an attempted coup, stating that 80 gunmen had infiltrated the National Palace. Maurice indicated the attackers were led by Guy Phillipe, a police commissioner in exile in the Dominican Republic. He also mentioned a simultaneous attack on the National Penitentiary before being rebuffed, implicating Lucien Gervais, a former military figure, as another leader behind the coup. The local media provided continuous coverage, with journalists stationed at Champs de Mars Square reporting live.\nJean Auriel, head of presidential security, informed the press the assailants had fled in pickup trucks, with elite police forces regaining control of the palace. By noon, Minister of Culture and Communication Guy Paul signaled the end of the coup attempt and urged the public to remain calm. In the afternoon, National Police spokesman Jean Dady Sim\u00e9on confirmed the attempted coup involved about 30 assailants, reporting that the confrontation had left five dead, including two policemen, one assailant, and two civilians. At the time of the coup, President Aristide and his family were not present at the National Palace; instead, they were at their residence in suburban Tabarre located five kilometers away from the palace. Ultimately, seven of the attackers were captured.\nAt a press conference held by President Aristide following the coup attempt, he described it as a threat to democracy and praised the people's response in defending democracy, calling for peaceful mobilization to protect democracy. Following the press conference, the president delivered a \"message of peace,\" praising the police and citizens for preventing the coup plotters from escaping and stressed the need for continued solidarity between the people and police.\nAftermath\nHours after the failed coup attempt, government supporters armed themselves with machetes and sticks, taking to the streets to harass members of the opposition, including figures from the Struggling People's Organization (OPL) and Democratic Convergence, as well as the media. Local radio stations in the capital of Port-au-Prince were threatened with destruction and journalists faced violent reprisals while the homes of many opposition figures and offices were attacked, looted, and burned.

    "Concert tour by Joker Xue\nThe Skyscraper World Tour is the second concert tour and first world tour held by Chinese singer-songwriter Joker Xue. Xue performed 23 shows across four continents with 15 shows in Asia, 1 show in Europe, 4 shows in North America, and 3 shows in Oceania. All venues in Mainland China were upgraded from arena to stadium.\nBackground\nIn 2017, Xue promised his fans that if they weren't able to meet at the I Think I've Seen You Somewhere Tour, he would meet them again on a bigger stage. In 2018, he fulfilled that promise with Skyscraper World Tour.

    "\nRadio station in Schaan, Liechtenstein\nRadio Liechtenstein is the public radio station of Liechtenstein. It is the first and primary station to broadcast in Liechtenstein. They primarily broadcast local news, world news, music, sports, events and podcasts. There were plans to launch a radio broadcaster in the late 1930s, but this was discontinued. The plans to bring back the radio broadcaster began in 1991, with the station being launched on 15 August 1995. It is operated by the Liechtenstein Broadcasting Corporation (LRF) and funded by the Liechtenstein Government. The headquarters are located in Schaan.\nIn 2021, the station reported an average viewership of 21,530 people, 10,800 of which came from within Liechtenstein itself. The majority of listeners of the station come Switzerland, for its German-speaking population in the north-east of Switzerland, which borders Liechtenstein. Due to the high commuter flows from Switzerland, its official broadcast area includes the lower Rhine Valley, which is served by two FM stations in St. Margrethen and Thal and the DAB block in eastern Switzerland as far as Lake Constance.\nProgramming\nThe legal programming mandate describes in the editorial section an objective and comprehensive range of information for the general public from all relevant sectors for a broad target group, which should be sophisticated and balanced, but also entertaining and take into account the culture, independence and other characteristics of Liechtenstein. The programming principles correspond to the public service's self-image.\nThe broadcaster aims to broadcast an objective and comprehensive range of information for the general public for its news programming. News is broadcast every hour from 6am to 7pm, which can be listened to in the \"Media Library\" section on the station's website. There is also a new Radio Liechtenstein app available since the end of 2023, replacing the original \"Radio L\" app.\nThe station also aims to showcase Liechtensteiner culture, entertainment, music and other aspects of Liechtenstein. Its music style is described as \u201cadult contemporary\u201d, with a mix of songs from the 1970s and 1980s. Radio Liechtenstein also likes to promote music from local artists and genres unique to the country, including songs in the German language.\nHistory\nFormer logo as Radio L\nOn October 15, 1938, a Radio Liechtenstein broadcast on 700\u00a0kHz medium wave from Vaduz. On November 21, 1938, the transmission mast collapsed as a result of a storm, which resulted in a transmission outage for several days. Although Lirag ( German: Liechtenstein'sche Radio-Gesellschaft) was founded on February 20, 1939, the simple music program of Radio Liechtenstein was discontinued in September 1939 at the beginning of the Second World War due to financial difficulties, after the government had informed the population about the events and the measures to be taken.\nOn 15 August 1995, after a trial period starting in 1991, a station called Radio L began official broadcasting as a private radio station. Radio L was the first post-war radio station in Liechtenstein. When the broadcasting fee was abolished in January 1999, which until then had mainly financed the distribution of Swiss programs in Liechtenstein, the private station was one of the only providers, along with the local print media, to provide services as a public service for Liechtenstein. Since then, funding from the then newly designed state media funding has been available to pay for this public service mandate. They are supplemented by advertising and sponsorship.\nAfter eight years and an investment of 12 million Swiss francs (12.3 million euros), private investor Peter Ritter withdrew from the radio station in 2003. According to figures from the Publica Data Institute, the station had more than 50,000 listeners at that time, of which in German-speaking Switzerland alone, with an average reach of 37,200 listeners per day, three times as many listeners as in Liechtenstein itself with 12,200.\nAfter several negotiations with the government, Radio Liechtenstein was converted into a public broadcaster on January 1, 2004. 750,000 francs from the state budget were invested in the expansion and reconstruction of the broadcasting network, and line rental costs were saved by switching to ball reception. In this report in October 2005, the government stated that the station produced \"a similar amount of information and spoken contributions\" compared to Radio Rumantsch and Radio DRS with around 1/10 of public funding, which meant \"about twice the information output per employee (full-time equivalent)\". Nevertheless, further savings and efficiency improvements were planned in the following years.\nIn October 2013, the government applied for the restructuring of the national budget (\"Package of Measures III\"). The reintroduction of a broadcasting fee was intended to relieve the national budget by 1.5 million francs from 2015, but was rejected again in July 2015 becau",

    "This article is about the operation carried out by the ARBiH in November 1994. For other operations codenamed \"Operation Autumn '94\", see Battle of Kupres (1994).\nThe Operation Autumn '94 (in Bosnian: Operacija Jesen '94), also called the Second Mitrovdan offensive (in Serbian Latin: Druga mitrovdanska ofanziva; in Serbian Cyrillic: \u0414\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0430) was an operation carried out by the ARBiH against the VRS during the Bosnian War, with the goal of taking control over Podvele\u017e and Vele\u017e, south-east of Mostar.\nBackground\nThroughout 1994, Bosniak forces in Herzegovina directed their attacks on the Herzegovina Corps of the Army of Republika Srpska during the Siege of Mostar. Since the Bosniak army lacked armored vehicles and large-calibre weapons but was far more numerous in infantry, the ARBiH developed the doctrine of inserting large sabotage groups into the rear of the VRS. After the October unsuccessful attacks on Konjic, which was defended by the 2nd Herzegovina Brigade of the VRS, the ARBiH shifted its focus to the Mostar\u2013Nevesinje direction, launching the operation codenamed Autumn '94. However, the operation was planned poorly and the VRS already knew about it, so they inserted some defences.\nOperation Autumn '94\nThe ARBiH began preparing the attack by inserting 1,000 saboteurs, part of the Black Swans unit, behind the lines of the VRS 8th Motorized Brigade on November 9. Part of the saboteurs were already found by a group of about 20 fighters in the area of Bruska on that same evening. During the following clashes, 113 fighters of the second battalion of the 41st Mostar Brigade of the ARBiH were encircled, and then captured after the commander of the 8th Motorized Brigade Zoran Purkovic  ordered a circular defense and increased vigilance. The following night, more saboteurs continued to insert, but they were met with fierce fire by the Serbian fighters. The battle broke out on November 11, when the ARBiH launched a frontal attack, but the VRS fighters defended all positions, especially in the village of Banjdol. By the end of the day, the ARBiH began to retreat, while minor skirmishes with broken Bosniak groups continued in the following days, that were all repelled.\n",
    "Azerbaijani carpets\nGaragoyunlu \u2014 Azerbaijani carpets belonging to the Ganja-Gazakh and Karabakh carpet weaving centres. The name of the carpets is related to the names of the Garagoyunlu tribes living on the territory of Azerbaijan.\nGara Goyunlu rug, Karabakh school, XVIII c\nEtymology\nThe names of these carpets, which belong to the Gazakh group, are related to the names of the Garagoyunlu tribes that lived on the eastern and northern shores of Goycha Lake. In some Russian sources the name of the district is mentioned as Goychay.\nGaragoyunlu is a tribal union of Oghuz Turkmen origin. Such works as Historical Turkmenia and Historical King of Qutbshahi tell the history of Garagoyunlu people, it is shown that the Garagoyunlu people came from Turkestan to Azerbaijan, Iran and Eastern Anatolia in 1202-1203 under the leadership of Tore Bey, the 7th great-grandfather of Kara Yusuf, a descendant of Oghuz, with a population of 30 thousand tents. In 1410, the Garagoyunlu people founded the Garagoyunlu state under the leadership of Kara Yusuf.\nAt the end of the 19th century, there were 16 villages named Garagoyunlu in the South Caucasus.\nThe residents of these settlements have been engaged in animal husbandry and agriculture for centuries, as well as in carpet weaving. The villages of Polad, Chaykend, Golkend, Agbulag, Tala, Karvansara and Uzuntala, located in the north and east of Goycha Lake, are distinguished by weaving of Garagoyunlu carpets. The patterns of carpets woven in this region follow the traditions of Central Asian carpet weaving.\nAbout\nGaragoyunlu carpets are Azerbaijani carpets belonging to the Ganja-Gazakh and Karabakh carpet weaving centres. The name of the carpets is related to the name of the Garagoyunlu tribe inhabiting the territory of Azerbaijan.\nArtistic analysis\nThese carpets have a medallion composition in several versions.\nThe first version includes carpets with central field consisting only of polygonal medallions. These medallions, located in the middle area along the vertical axis, are similar in shape to the lakes of Guba Zeyva carpets. According to the information from the Carpet Weavers of the Gazakh-Borchaly Region book by Vidadi Muradov, the first version of the Garagoyunlu carpets are still woven in Tovuz and Gazakh regions, as well as in the Bolnisi region (Georgia), which is inhabited by the Azerbaijanis.\nThe carpet medallions of the second version are relatively small and their edges are, as per the local carpet weavers, hooked. The name of Garagoyunlu is mentioned in the analysis of carpets belonging to the Jabrayil group, where two animal heads are depicted symmetrically between the medallions. Local carpet makers claim it is a two-headed dragon, while as per the others it is a duck. Let's remember that the peoples of Central Asia including Kyrgyzstan, Gazakhstan, North and North-West Azerbaijan believe that ducks and geese bring prosperity and abundance and treated them as sacred birds. The name of the village Ordakli in Azerbaijan is also related to this belief. In the Guba-Shirvan carpets, some fragments of the carpets of the second variant can be admitted, especially the thin interwoven stripes covering the central field and the small border located nearby.\nThe old carpet weavers call the carpets belonging to the third version Heykal. Rarely produced today, but they once were popular and fashionable carpets of the Gazakh carpet group. There are three large medallions arranged in a row in the central field. They have broken contours made with broken lines. The central axis of symmetry horizontally divides the middle area into two parts, creating a picture of two full-face human busts. Heykal carpets with the divided into rectangles by straight lines middle area can also be noticed. The borders of the carpet are designed according to the intermediary field and are very specific.\nAccording to its origin, Garagoyunlu carpets are an example of Turkic folk art, and according to their composition \u2013 reminiscent of Central Asian and Azerbaijani carpets called Gazakh carpets. Its middle area has two grounds \u2013 back and front with a large medallion with toothed images. The upper and lower parts of the medallion are marked with Kohna Nakhish (old pattern) typical of ancient Mughan carpets. The delicate border, which rises from the bottom to the top, breaks 20\u00a0cm before the upper corner of the central area and is directed towards the central axis, creating a mihrab (arch), which is bordered by a delicate stripe and has a religious significance and a symbolic meaning typical for prayers. If you look closely, you can see a similarity with the silhouette of a front view of a broad-shouldered person. This fantastic image is one of the stars found by peoples living in the Middle East and Central Asia, where astro worship existed before the Arab invasion. During the Arab-Islamic reign, this symbolic sign began to express the characteristics of the new religion \u2013 Islam, and acquired the religio",
    "Television station in Paran\u00e1, Brazil\nCNT Curitiba is a Brazilian television station based in Curitiba, capital of the state of Paran\u00e1. It operates on channel 6 (digital UHF 43) and is both an owned-and-operated station and the generator of Central Nacional de Televis\u00e3o. It shares the leadership of the network with CNT Rio de Janeiro and CNT Tropical. The channel was opened in 1960 as TV Paran\u00e1 on the initiative of journalists Assis Chateaubriand, owner of the media conglomerate Di\u00e1rios Associados, from which the station had support, and Adherbal Stresser. Sold to the Martinez family, it led a small state network in the 1980s that later had national coverage, Rede OM. It changed its identification to CNT in 1993.\nHistory\nTV Paran\u00e1 was opened on December 19, 1960, being the second television station launched in the state, which had been with TV Paranaense since October 29 of the same year. The station had logistical support from Di\u00e1rios Associados, a media conglomerate belonging to journalist Assis Chateaubriand, who directly acquired the concession of channel 6 in Curitiba from the Federal Government, and its installation was in charge of Adherbal Stresser, then director of the newspaper Di\u00e1rio do Paran\u00e1. The support allowed the channel to benefit from equipment and professionals from TV Tupi in S\u00e3o Paulo, also from the Chateaubriand group, from which some of its programs were retransmitted in Paran\u00e1. The local network prioritized sports broadcasts, and the station was the first in Brazil to show a football game with narration.\nIn 1975, Di\u00e1rios Associados and the Stresser family sold TV Paran\u00e1 to businessman Oscar Martinez, and his son Jos\u00e9 Carlos Martinez took over the management of the station. In 1978, it began retransmitting Rede Bandeirantes programming. The following year, the Martinezs opened TV Tropical in Londrina, which would also be affiliated with Bandeirantes. Both channels form a state network that in 1982 was named Rede OM (acronym for Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Martinez). During the 1980s, two other stations were created and made up the network \u2014 TV Carim\u00e3 de Cascavel and TV Maring\u00e1.\nIn June 1991, TV Paran\u00e1 and TV Tropical joined Rede Record. At the end of that year, plans were announced to expand OM's coverage to other states, which would make it a nationwide network, with TV Paran\u00e1 as generator, thus ceasing to retransmit Record and assuming independent programming. The launch of the Rede OM Brasil took place in March 1992. In May of the following year, with the wear and tear caused by the controversies in which it was involved, the network changed its name to Central Nacional de Televis\u00e3o (CNT), and its O&Os adopted the new name.\nTechnical information\n",
    "Plaid Cymru frontbench team in the National Assembly for Wales (2011\u20132012)\nThis article is about the Plaid Cymru frontbench team under Ieuan Wyn Jones from 2011 to 2012. For the Shadow Cabinet of Wales led by Jones from 2000 to 2007, see Shadow Cabinet of Ieuan Wyn Jones.\nIeuan Wyn Jones, the leader of Plaid Cymru, formed his frontbench team of party spokespeople in the National Assembly for Wales on 25 May 2011 after the dissolution of his party's coalition government with Rhodri Morgan and Carwyn Jones' Welsh Labour following the 2011 National Assembly for Wales election. Jones had previously led a shadow cabinet before entering coalition from 2000 to 2007, when his party had served as the Official Opposition since the 1999 National Assembly for Wales election. \nAt the 2011 assembly election, Plaid Cymru's share of seats in the assembly fell from 15 to 11 seats to make it the third-largest party in the assembly. The Welsh Conservatives, which had served as the official opposition for the duration of the coalition government, won enough seats to supersede Plaid as the second-largest party with 14 seats and remained the official opposition after the end of the coalition. Jones announced that he would resign as Plaid leader in the first half of the assembly term and on 15 March 2012 Leanne Wood won a leadership election to succeed him as leader before forming a new frontbench team. \nBackground\nIeuan Wyn Jones was elected president of Plaid Cymru in 2000 following the resignation of the previous president Dafydd Wigley on grounds of ill health. At the time, Plaid Cymru was the Official Opposition in the National Assembly for Wales, so Jones formed a shadow cabinet. After the 2007 National Assembly for Wales election, Jones engaed in coalition talks with the Welsh Liberal Democrats and the Welsh Conservatives to end Rhodri Morgan's Welsh Labour minority government. After these talks broke drown, Jones entered talks with Labour and in July Plaid Cymru formed a coalition government, with Jones becoming Morgan's deputy first minister. Plaid continued to serve in coalition with Labour after Morgan resigned and was succeeded by Carwyn Jones in 2009, with Ieuan Wyn Jones remaining as deputy first minister.\nAt the 2011 National Assembly for Wales election, Plaid Cymru share of seats fell from 15 to 11 seats and it lost its place as the second-largest party to the Welsh Conservatives, which won 14 seats and remained the Official Opposition, having gained that status after Plaid joined the government in 2007. After the election, Labour did not renew its coalition with Plaid Cymru and instead formed a minority government. As it was not the Official Opposition, Plaid Cymru did not form the new Welsh Shadow Cabinet, though it could appoint a frontbench team of party spokespeople like other minor opposition parties in the assembly.\nHistory\nJones formed his frontbench team of party spokespeople on 25 May 2011. Jones appointed himself as the spokesperson for finance and the constitution. Jocelyn Davies became the Plaid Cymru Group business manager and also its chief whip and the spokesperson for planning.  The other appointments included Elin Jones as spokesperson for health, Simon Thomas as spokesperson for spokesperson for education, higher education and skills, Alun Ffred Jones as spokesperson for business, enterprise, technology and science, Leanne Wood as spokesperson for housing and regeneration, Rhodri Glyn Thomas as spokesperson for Europe, local government, communities and transport, Dafydd Elis-Thomas as spokesperson for environment and energy, Bethan Jenkins as spokesperson for heritage, Welsh language and sport, Lindsay Whittle as spokesperson for social services, children and equal opportunities, and Llyr Gruffydd as spokesperson for rural affairs (inc. agriculture, animal health and welfare).\nOn 13 May 2011, Jones announced that he would resign as the leader of Plaid Cymru sometime in the first half of the 4th assembly term which would end in 2016 following its disappointing performance at the 2011 assembly election. In October 2011, Jones announced that a leadership election would be held on 15 March 2012 to elect his successor. By December 2011, Dafydd Elis-Thomas, Elin Jones, Leanne Wood and Simon Thomas had all declared their intention to stand for the leadership. Thomas withdrew from the race in February 2012 and on 15 March 2012 Wood defeated Jones and Elis-Thomas and was elected the new leader of Plaid Cymru.

    "German philologist, academic and author\nMichael Resler (born July 7, 1948) is a philologist, academic, and author, specializing in the late-12th- and early-13th-century German Arthurian romance. He is a professor of German Studies at Boston College.\nMost known for his work on medieval Germanic philology, Resler has authored six books, including works on Daniel von dem Bl\u00fchenden Tal by der Stricker and Hartmann von Aue's Erec. Additionally, he was awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for the academic year 1980\u201381. In 2014, he was honored with the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany), the highest award accorded to civilians by the German government, in recognition of his successful mentorship of (at the time) 100 Fulbright applicants to Germany and Austria.\nEducation\nResler earned his A.B. degree in German from the College of William & Mary in 1970. Subsequently, he completed an A.M. at Harvard University in 1974, and a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1976. In addition, he has studied at the Universit\u00e4t Salzburg, Austria, and in Germany at the Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum and the Johannes-Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t in Mainz.\nCareer\nResler began his academic career in 1972 as a teaching fellow in Germanic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University, where he served until 1976. After completing his doctorate at Harvard in 1976, he obtained a position in the German Studies Department at Boston College, where he has continued to teach, since 1991 at the rank of professor of German Studies. Additionally, he held a position as a lecturer in German at Harvard University Extension from 1978 to 1994.\nWorks\nResler has published six books on medieval Germanic philology, including both critical editions and translations from Middle High German into English. His first book, a critical edition of Daniel von dem Bl\u00fchenden Tal (Daniel of the Blossoming Valley), appeared in 1983 in the Altdeutsche Textbibliothek series. His 1987 work is an English-language translation of Erec by Hartmann von Aue, presenting the earliest German Arthurian romance (ca. 1185) within its historical and cultural context, accompanied by detailed notes referencing scholarly research from over a century.\nResler has made contributions to the Daniel text, the earliest (ca. 1210\u20131225) freely invented German-language (composed in Middle High German) Arthurian romance, as he has published both a critical edition of that text and the sole English-language translation. That translation (1990), accompanied by an introduction and extensive annotation, made the Daniel tale available to English-speaking readers for the first time in its 800-year history; the introduction offered insights into the textual history, language, and cultural significance of Daniel within the context of the German Arthurian tradition. His 1995 book provided an updated critical edition of the Daniel text, revised to incorporate the readings of a newly discovered Daniel manuscript. In his 2003 book, he presented a dual-language (Middle High German and English), facing-page edition of the Daniel text; in the introduction, he analyzed this work, providing historical information and textual notes, while highlighting its new level of originality within the genre \u2014  a significant departure from earlier, epigonic German Arthurian literature. In 2015, he published a revised and expanded third edition of the critical text of Daniel; so as to make the Middle High German text more readily accessible to non-expert readers, a second apparatus \u2014 a comprehensive textual commentary \u2014 featured linguistic, syntactical and lexicographical elucidations of the individual verses. Additionally, he has also authored journal articles, book chapters, encyclopedia entries and book reviews over the course of his career.\nAwards and honors\n1970 \u2013 Woodrow Wilson Fellowship\n1970-71 \u2014Fulbright - DAAD Combined Research Grant to Germany\n1980-81 \u2014 National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship\n1997 \u2013 Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Award, Omicron Chapter of Massachusetts, Boston College\n2014 \u2013 Bundesverdienstkreuz, Federal Republic of Germany\nBibliography\nBooks\nDer Stricker.

    "\nSir Alexander Wentworth Macdonald Bosville Macdonald, 14th Baronet JP DL (n\u00e9 Alexander Wentworth Macdonald Bosville; 26 September 1865 \u2013 26 March 1933) was an English landowner of Scottish descent.\nEarly life\nBorn as Alexander Wentworth Macdonald Bosville (1826\u20131865) on 26 September 1865, he was the only son of Godfrey Wentworth Bayard Bosville,  de jure 13th Baronet, and Hon. Harriet Cassandra Willoughby, who was granted the rank of a baron's daughter in c.\u20091856. His father died less than a month after his birth. His paternal aunt, Julia Louisa Bosville, married his maternal uncle, Henry Willoughby, 8th Baron Middleton.\nHis paternal grandparents were Alexander William Robert Bosville (eldest son of Lt.-Gen. Godfrey Macdonald, 3rd Baron Macdonald) and Matilda Eliza Moffat Bayard (a daughter of Col. John Bayard).  His maternal grandparents were Henry Willoughby (son of the Rev. Hon. James Willoughby, a grandson of the 1st Baron Middleton) and Charlotte Eyre (a daughter of Venerable John Eyre Archdeacon of Nottingham).\nHe was educated at Aldin House, Slough, then Eton College before attending Magdalen College, Oxford.\nCareer\nLess than a month after his birth, he became de jure 14th Baronet Macdonald, of Sleat, in the Isle of Skye, County Inverness, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. Upon the death of his great-grandfather, Godfrey Macdonald, 3rd Baron Macdonald, 11th Baronet, in 1832 the baronetcy reverted as his three eldest children were born before his marriage to Louisa Maria La Coast (said to have been the illegitimate daughter of Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, himself a son of Frederick, Prince of Wales and a younger brother of King George III), so they were considered illegitimate, while the ten children born after their marriage were considered legitimate. The eldest three were eventually legitimized by Scottish law, but not by Irish law, therefore, the baronetcy passed, de jure, to his eldest son, Alexander (the grandfather of the 14th Baronet), while the Irish barony passed to his third son, Godfrey. Alexander's claim, however, was not formally recognised until a Court of Sessions decree on 4 June 1910. With this revival of the 1625 title, granted precedence as second of the Nova Scotia baronets at the time, the holder became the premier baronet. To 1908, the Gordon baronets of Letterfourie, created 28 May 1625, had been premier. On 30 June 1910 his name was legally changed to Alexander Wentworth Macdonald Bosville Macdonald confirmed by Lord Lyon King of Arms.\nHe inherited the family estates at Thorpe and Gunthwaite, both in Yorkshire, which came into the family through Elizabeth Diana Bosville (wife of Alexander Macdonald, 1st Baron Macdonald and heiress of her uncle, William Bosville). He was a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant of East Riding, Yorkshire. He also served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1901.\nPersonal life\nArcadian Shepherds by Giovanni Benedetto CastiglioneThe Miraculous Draught of Fishes by Joachim Beuckelaer\nOn 20 October 1886, Alexander married Alice Edith Middleton (1861\u20131935), a writer who was a daughter of John Middleton of Kinfauns Castle, Perth, a descendant of the \"old Scottish Earls of Middleton.\" Together, they lived at Thorpe Hall, Bridlington, and were the parents of:\nSir Godfrey Middleton Bosville Macdonald, 15th Baronet (1887\u20131951), who married Hon. Rachel Audrey Campbell, daughter of Scottish banker Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Colgrain and Lady Angela Ryder (a daughter of the 4th Earl of Harrowby), in 1917.\nCelia Violet Bosville (b. 1889), who graduated from Oxford University in 1960; she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1919, and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, in 1937.\nSir Alexander died at Thorpe Hall on 26 March 1933, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his only son, Godfrey. His widow died on 15 July 1935.\nArt collection\nFrom his father, Sir Alexander inherited the c.\u20091655 Arcadian Shepherds by Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, and the c.\u20091563 The Miraculous Draught of Fishes by Joachim Beuckelaer. The Miraculous Draught of Fishes had been acquired by his great-grandfather, the 3rd Baron Macdonald, by 1821, and Arcadian Shepherds by the 3rd Baron Macdonald from Christie's in 1822 (from the 2nd Marquess of Bute). Both stayed in the family until the early 1907s when they were sold by his great-grandson, Sir Ian Bosville Macdonald, 17th Baronet. Arcadian Shepherds was sold at Christie's in 1970 to David Carritt, Ltd. (who sold it to the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1972) and The Miraculous Draught of Fishes was consigned in 1971 to Herner-Wengraf Ltd in London who sold it to the J. Paul Getty Museum.\n",

Nr. 6569)\nPetersaue Palace (German: Schloss Petersaue) is a former neoclassical palace on the Rhine Isle of Petersaue near Mainz, Germany. It was commissioned by Prince-elector and Archbishop of Mainz, Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal (1719\u20131802). Today nothing remains anymore of the palace.\nHistory\nFriedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal\nMap of the Rhine Isle of Petersaue of 1798 showing the location of the Electoral Palace right above and the fortifications created by the French\nPetersaue is an island in the Rhine river near Mainz. It was originally the property of the collegiate church monastery of St. Peter before the walls, to which the isle owes its name. The monastery existed since the 10th century and was dedicated to the apostle Peter as patron. The monks build a charterhouse on the island.\nFriedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal was Prince-elector and Archbishop of Mainz from 1774 to 1802. Near his secondary residence, Schloss Johannisburg in Aschaffenburg, he created the Sch\u00f6nbusch Palace with one of the first English landscape gardens of Germany. \nIn 1781, he acquired the charterhouse on the Petersaue Island. Behind the charterhouse with view on Mainz, he constructed a one-storey maison de plaisance in neoclassical style.\nWho the architect of Schloss Petersaue is, is not known. The Portuguese architect Emanuel Joseph von Herigoyen (1746-1817) could be a possibility as he designed various buildings for the Prince-elector in Aschaffenburg and Sch\u00f6nbusch. Another candidate is Francois Ignace Mangin (1742-1809), who designed the Electoral Palace in Koblenz. The palace was decorated with frescoes by the Koblenz painter Januarius Zick. Zick also worked at the Electoral palace in the city of Mainz itself. This part of the Petersaue island became known as the Electoral Island (German: Kurf\u00fcrstliche Aue).\nOwnership of the palace changed multiple times in the Napoleonic times. During the French Revolutionary Wars, Mainz was besieged and conquered by the French.  They decided to significantly enlarge the Fortress of Mainz, and strongly fortified the island of Petersaue.\nToday nothing remains anymore of the Electoral palace on the Petersaue Island. There are various maps of the island showing the locations of the palace. Also, there is a painting with a view of Mainz by Christian Georg Sch\u00fctz showing the Electoral palace of Petersaue. It is owned by the Bavarian State Painting Collections (inventory number 6569) and part of the State Gallery of Schloss Johannisberg, where it is on display with other Views of Mainz by Christian Georg Sch\u00fctz. The island itself is not accessible for visitors.\n",
    "Irish figurative artist (born 1994)\nSalvatore of Lucan (born 1994) (real name Salvatore Fullam) is an Irish artist from Lucan, the eponymous suburb of Dublin. The artist primarily paints large-scale works most of which focus on his own life and often explore themes of home, identity and relationships. The Irish Museum of Modern Art classified his work as \"expansive domestic scenes where realism meets the uncanny, and the familiar broaches the magical.\"\nLife\nFullam is of mixed-race, being half Bangladeshi on his father's side and half Irish on his mother's. His parents met in Munich in the 1980s. He did not know his father growing up and was raised by his mother, alongside his younger sister, in Lucan. He attended CBS Lucan.\nFullam's uncle was a self-taught artist whose surrealist oil paintings were \"all over\" the house as he grew up. He remembers looking at them as a child and trying to figure out what their meaning was.:\u200a0:06\u200a\nSalvatore met his father for the first time in 2018 in New York, which he later used as a setting for the painting \"Me and my Dad in McDonalds\" (2018).:\u200a4:30\u200a Fullam mentioned that his father had been \"an illegal immigrant for over half his life, leaving Bangladesh and going from country to country until finally ending up in America.\"\nName\nIn 2018, Fullam decided to start painting under the alias 'Salvatore of Lucan', owing to the fact that he is often asked where he is from, even though he is Irish.  The fact that he was given an Italian name as a child complicated the issue growing up, as explained by the artist:\n \"...And also, I'm not Italian at all, I just have an Italian name. I used to have to tell my whole life story when people asked me where I was from. Also, I love Lucan. And I'm from there\".\nThe naming format also reminded Fullam of renaissance artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, who were often known by their place of birth.\nCareer\nAccording to the artist, he was not academically gifted and thus found it an \"easy choice\" to go to art college, where he studied Fine Art Painting but was initially interested in studying fashion.:\u200a0:45\u200a He graduated from the National College of Art and Design (NCAD) in 2016. As Fullam explained in a 2024 interview: \n \"I started my career by going on the dole and renting a studio that I rarely left. After about one or two years, I started getting into some group shows. Eventually I was given a show in Pallas Projects as part of their program there\".\nFullam's first show, entitled \"Show of Himself\", took place in Pallas Projects, Dublin in 2018. In 2019, he won the Whyte's Award, was nominated for Hennessy Craig Award at the RHA, appeared in RT\u00c9's 'Exhibitionists - Road to the RHA' documentary and received the Arts Council's 'Next Generation Award'. The artist participated in Culture Night 2020 as part of an Arts Council showcase of paintings that had been recently added to its collection.\nFullam's first time exhibiting paintings outside of Ireland was at the Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Pavilion in Zagreb as part of Pallas Projects '6th Biennial of Painting' in October 2021.\nHe won the National Gallery of Ireland's Zurich Portrait Prize on 30 November 2021 for his submission \"Me Ma Healing Me\" (2020), which was inspired by his mother's use of sound healing and reiki to care for him.:\u200a0:12\u200a He had been nominated twice before for the same award.\nFullam's show Fancy Situations opened at Dublin's Kevin Kavanagh Gallery on 6 June 2024.\nArtistic style\nFullams' paintings have been noted to often consist of \"figurative domestic scenes\" where \"the familiar approaches the magical\". As he notes: \"My day to day life is also a mix between realism and imagination. So, I depict it the same way I experience them in real life\".\nFullam has noted that he can spend weeks just on graph paper before he starts painting a large-scale work.\nInfluences\nFullam remembers wanting to become a painter after his art teacher introduced him to artists such as Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and David Hockney in school. He subsequently discovered Egon Schiele himself.:\u200a1:05\u200a\nIn creating the painting \"Me Ma Healing Me\", for which he won the Zurich Portrait Prize, Fullam explained how he \"was inspired by the kind of uncanny, suspended feeling one finds in the alchemist paintings of Leonora Carrington\".\n",
    "Motor car race\nThe 2024 Brickyard 400 is an upcoming NASCAR Cup Series race that will held on July 21, 2024, at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. Contested over 160 laps on the 2.5-mile (4.0\u00a0km) oval, it will be the 22nd race of the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series season. It is the 30th running of the Brickyard 400, and first since 2020.\nReport\nBackground\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway, the track where the race will be held.\nThe Indianapolis Motor Speedway, located in Speedway, Indiana, (an enclave suburb of Indianapolis) in the United States, is the home of the Indianapolis 500 and the Brickyard 400. It is located on the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road, approximately six miles (10\u00a0km) west of Downtown Indianapolis.\nConstructed in 1909, it is the original speedway, the first racing facility so named. It has a permanent seating capacity estimated at 235,000 with infield seating raising capacity to an approximate 400,000. It is the highest-capacity sports venue in the world.\nConsidered relatively flat by American standards, the track is a 2.5-mile (4.0\u00a0km), nearly rectangular oval with dimensions that have remained essentially unchanged since its inception: four 0.25-mile (0.40\u00a0km) turns, two 0.625-mile long (1.006\u00a0km) straightaways between the fourth and first turns and the second and third turns, and two .125-mile (0.201\u00a0km) short straightaways \u2013 termed \"short chutes\" \u2013 between the first and second, and third and fourth turns.\nThis will be the first NASCAR race on the Oval version since 2020, as the Verizon 200 at the Brickyard was held on the GP version from 2021 to 2023.\nEntry list\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\nMedia\nTelevision\nNBC Sports will cover the race on the television side.

    "Municipal building in Falmouth, Cornwall, England\nThe Old Town Hall is a historic building in the High Street in Falmouth, Cornwall, a town in England. The structure, which accommodates a small art gallery, is a Grade II* listed building.\nHistory\nThe building was commissioned as a Congregational chapel probably around 1700. It was designed in the Queen Anne style, built in brick, and was completed in around 1710. It is one of the oldest surviving non-conformist chapels in Cornwall, with only the Marazion Quaker Meeting House being older, and the one in Kea being of similar date.\nIn 1715, a new, larger chapel was constructed, and the old building was acquired by the lord of the manor, Martin Lister Killigrew of Arwenack Manor. He presented it to the people of Falmouth, together with two ceremonial maces, in 1725, and the local corporation then used it as a town hall.  It was also used as a courthouse, accommodating both the assizes and the County Court. Following the implementation of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, the mayor, aldermen and burgesses of Falmouth were replaced by an elected council which met in the town hall to discuss issues such as the response to the cholera pandemic of September 1849. The responses included whitewashing the town hall and altering the diet of patients being treated there.\nIn 1866 the corporation moved to larger premises on The Moor, now the Palacio Lounge, and the old town hall was sold to the Odd Fellows.  However, it continued to be used for judicial purposes: in 1884, it was the venue for the initial hearing, before magistrates, of the case of R v Dudley and Stephens, the trial of two sailors accused of cannibalism, having eaten the cabin boy when marooned at sea on the yacht, the Mignonette. The magistrates at Falmouth referred the matter to the assizes at Exeter and the sailors were eventually sentenced to 6 months in prison.\nIn 1948, the Odd Fellows sold the hall, which was converted into an antiques shop in 1986, and which, since June 2015, has served as an art gallery. Significant works of art in the gallery include a painting by the local artist, John Opie, depicting a beggar boy.\nArchitecture\nThe building is constructed of painted brick, with the quoins and the Gibbs surrounds finished in a rusticated stucco style.  The design involves a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing the High Street. The central bay features a short flight of steps leading up to a doorway with a fanlight and a Gibbs surround. The outer bays are fenestrated by round headed windows, also with Gibbs surrounds. At roof level, there is a cornice and a parapet. Internally, the building is two rooms deep. Inside, there is a decorative plaster ceiling, 18th-century dado panelling, and a staircase with reused 18th century elements. The building was grade II* listed in 1968.\nSee also\nGrade II* listed buildings in Cornwall (Q\u2013Z)\n",
    "South African lawyer (born 1963)\nMatthew Chaskalson SC (born 12 August 1963) is a South African lawyer and jurist who is best known for his work in constitutional litigation. He has frequently appeared in the Constitutional Court of South Africa and led evidence at both the Marikana Commission and the State Capture Commission. The son of Chief Justice Arthur Chaskalson, he was an acting judge in the Constitutional Court for two terms in 2023 and 2024.  \nEarly life and education\nChaskalson was born on 12 August 1963. He was the eldest of two sons born to Arthur Chaskalson, who was a prominent anti-apartheid lawyer and who later served as Chief Justice of South Africa from 2001 to 2005. He attended King David School in Linksfield, Johannesburg, where he matriculated in 1980. Thereafter he attended the University of the Witwatersrand, completing a BA in 1984, Honours in 1985, and an LLB in 1990, all cum laude.\nLegal career\nAfter his graduation, Chaskalson was a candidate attorney from 1990 to 1991, working in Johannesburg at the mining law firm of Bell Dewar Hall. In 1992, he returned to his alma mater, initially as a lecturer in delict and constitutional law and then, from 1995 to 2000, as head of the constitutional law project at the university's Centre for Applied Legal Studies.\nAlthough he was admitted to the bar in 1994, he did not practise as an advocate full-time until 2001, when he joined the Johannesburg Bar as junior counsel. He was awarded silk in 2009, and as senior counsel he was a founding member of the Victoria Mxenge Group in 2011 and the Pan African Bar Association of South Africa in 2018. Judges Matter described the Mxenge Group as \"a nascent project to effect racial, gender and diversity transformation in the advocates\u2019 profession\", and the Pan African Bar Association was founded as an explicitly \"black and women-oriented\" organisation.\nChaskalson was prolific in litigation in the Supreme Court of Appeal and Constitutional Court of South Africa; indeed, for several years, he frequently argued cases in front of his father's bench. He attained additional public prominence as a member of the staffs of two high-profile commissions of inquiry: he led evidence at the Marikana Commission from 2012 to 2014, where he worked alongside Mbuyiseli Madlanga and Geoff Budlender, and later at the State Capture Commission from 2019 to 2021, where he led the questioning of Deputy Minister Zizi Kodwa. His work at the State Capture Commission focused on illicit financial flows and he later assisted the National Prosecuting Authority's Asset Forfeiture Unit in related civil recovery efforts.\nNotable briefs\nChaskalson has appeared in important cases in a broad variety of areas of constitutional law. In 1996, at the outset of the constitutional era, he argued in cases pertaining to the certification both of the Constitution of South Africa and of the provincial constitution of KwaZulu-Natal. In other notable administrative law matters, he represented the state in Fedsure Life Assurance v Johannesburg, Billy Masetlha in Masetlha v President, and (as senior counsel) Corruption Watch in Corruption Watch v President. Conversely, he appeared in an important series of cases on discrimination in family law, both relating to gender discrimination (as in Bhe v Magistrate, Khayelitsha, Daniels v Campbell, and Fraser v Children's Court) and to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation (as in Du Toit v Minister of Welfare and Population Development, Gory v Kolver, and National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice). A final major strand of litigation concerned freedom of expression (including in Islamic Unity Convention v Independent Broadcasting Authority, Khumalo v Holomisa, Phillips v DPP, and S v Mamabolo).\nConstitutional Court\nIn October 2023, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that he would appoint Chaskalson as an acting judge of the Constitutional Court for two consecutive terms, first from 1 November to 15 December 2023 and then from 1 February to 31 March 2024.\nDuring this acting service, but before he had issued any judgment from the bench, Chaskalson became one of five candidates whom the Judicial Service Commission shortlisted for possible permanent appointment to the Constitutional Court. The other candidates were Tati Makgoka, Ashton Schippers, Alan Dodson, and David Bilchitz. However, shortly before the candidates were interviewed in April 2024, Chaskalson withdrew from the contest due to injuries he had sustained in a cycling accident.\nScholarship\nChaskalson edited the first and second editions of Constitutional Law of South Africa, a constitutional law textbook which the Mail & Guardian called the field's \"bible\", and co-authored the first edition of South African Mineral and Petroleum Law, which Judges Matter called the \"leading publication\" in South African mining law. In addition, with Richard Spitz, he co-authored The Politics of Transition: The Hidden History of South Afr",
    "Swedish mineralogist and artist (1883-1947)\nGregori Aminoff (February 8, 1883 \u2013 February 11, 1947) was a Swedish mineralogist, artist, and a member of the Aminoff family. During his career, Aminoff introduced X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction to the Swedish scientific community and was a pioneer in crystallography in Sweden.\nEducation and career\nAminoff was born in Stockholm and studied mineralogy at Stockholm University and took exams at Uppsala University, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1905. He switched to art after graduation and studied art first at the Konstn\u00e4rsf\u00f6rbundets skola in Stockholm until its closure in 1908 and later in Italy with Henri Matisse. He exhibited with De Unga in Stockholm in 1909, 1910 and 1911, was represented at the Autumn Salon (Salon d'Automne) in Paris in 1909, and in 1912 together with Arvid Nilsson (1881\u20131971) had the solo exhibition Salon Joel in Stockholm. He also participated in exhibitions at the Konstn\u00e4rsf\u00f6rbundet (English: Artists' Association) and at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts' spring exhibitions. Aminoff liked to paint naked bodies in landscapes but also urban motifs, portraits and landscapes. He is represented with works at, among others, the National Museum in Stockholm.\nSelf portrait of Gregori Aminoff (1907)\nAminoff supported himself through his art practices mostly through taking temporary jobs. In 1914, Aminoff stopped painting and resumed his studies of mineralogy and crystallography, which he had previously put aside. Through the great support from his first wife, Aminoff received a licentiate at Stockholm University in 1916. He later received his PhD in 1918 from Stockholm University and became a docent in mineralogy and crystallography. In the same year, Aminoff introduced X-ray crystallography in Sweden. In 1923, he became a professor at the Mineralogical Department of the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The diffraction techniques he brought to Sweden later attracted the interests from people such as G\u00f6sta Phragm\u00e9n and Arne Westgren, whom Aminoff mentored. Aminoff was elected in 1933 as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Bj\u00f6rk\u00e9n Prize in 1935 along with Arne Westgren. A mineral found by Aminoff in L\u00e5ngban's mine in V\u00e4rmland has been named after him as aminoffite.\nPersonal life\nAminoff was the son of captain T\u00f6nnes Aminoff in the Svea Life Guards and Mathilda Aminoff, n\u00e9e Lindstr\u00f6m, who worked as a piano teacher. He was the nephew of Iwan T. Aminoff, the Swedish army officer and author. Aminoff married in 1908 a fellow student from Stockholm University, Ingrid Setterlund, daughter of head teacher Carl Setterlund. They had four daughters, Brita, Eva, Malin and Ulla. Aminoff was remarried to Birgit Broom\u00e9 (1892\u20131950), daughter of Emilia Broom\u00e9 and Erik Ludvig Broom\u00e9, in 1929. Aminoff published several papers in crystallography together with his second wife Broom\u00e9 (later Broom\u00e9-Aminoff). Aminoff died of a heart disease in 1947. The Aminoffs were buried at the Norra burial place (Norra begravningsplatsen) outside Stockholm.\nGregori Aminoff prize\nMain article: Gregori Aminoff prize\nAminoff's widow, Birgit Broom\u00e9-Aminoff, established the Professor Gregori Aminoff memorial fund in her will in 1950. The fund is administered by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and an annual prize, the Gregori Aminoff Prize, is awarded annually for published work in crystallography since 1979.\n",
    "\nGiuseppe Cannovale (1864 \u2013 1938) was an Italian engineer, urban planner, and entrepreneur.\nBiography\nEarly life\nProject for covering the Bisagno river and zoning plan, Genoa, 1905; in the lower left, Via XX Settembre can be seen in its modern structure, with the Palazzo delle Cupole, piazza Colombo, and on the far opposite side, the large Ospedale Galliera\nThe zoning plan for the redevelopment of the areas adjacent to the Bisagno river\nThe technical project for covering the Bisagno river\nThe project for Piazza Cola di Rienzo in Rome\nOne of Cannovale's patents\nGiuseppe Cannovale was born in Messina to Tommaso Cannovale. In 1884, he enrolled at the Royal School of Application for Engineers in Turin, becoming a civil engineer in 1889. In 1892, he competed to become an engineer for the Ministry of Finance, but did not place among the top twelve required.\nBy 1896, he had his own studio on Corso Vittorio Emanuele II in Turin, and later briefly moved to the province of Alessandria, in Tortona.\nThe success in Genoa\nCannovale found success after moving to Genoa in the early 20th century. He established his studio at via Frugoni 15, near via XX Settembre, where major urban development was taking place, involving prominent architects of the time such as Gino Copped\u00e8, Luigi Rovelli, Benvenuto Pesce Maineri, Cesare Gamba, Dario Carbone, Gaetano Orzali, Stefano Cuneo, Raffaele Croce, Giuseppe Tallero, G. B. Carpineti, the Celle brothers, and others. Cannovale arrived in the Ligurian capital at a critical time for the city, as the layout was changing and large residential districts were emerging. The most significant transformation of the area, extending from the forecourt of the Genova Brignole railway station to Corso Italia, was the covering of the Bisagno river and the zoning plan for the adjacent areas. The works were long debated and finally approved in 1919, and completed in 1930. Among the studies used for the intervention were those by Cannovale, the first to be presented, as well as by Pesce-Maineri (the one approved with modifications), Renzo Picasso, Gaetano Orzali, and others.\nSignificant, especially from a historical perspective, were the studies conducted by Cannovale regarding the Bisagno river. In particular, between 1905 and 1907, he studied and measured the correct maximum flow of the river in case of floods, and proposed specific engineering projects that, if implemented, would have prevented the many catastrophic floods that occurred in Genoa throughout the following century, as was evident only in the 2000s.\nThe company's expansion across Italy\nHe then dedicated himself particularly to civil engineering and technical-industrial innovation. At the beginning of the century, modern engineering technology was in its infancy, with numerous innovations emerging, the most important of which was the Hennebique system, or reinforced concrete. Cannovale began conceiving his projects with an entrepreneurial approach, becoming the exclusive licensee for Italy of the Wayss & Freytag cement production system, one of the first in the history of modern concrete construction.\nCannovale patented a \"new system of reinforced concrete constructions with air chambers\" in 1906 and later a \"new Cannovale Monolithic Floor System with air chambers,\" which spread and brought him success. This system was used, for example, in the construction of the Provincial Marine Hospice in Rimini. In 1909, Cannovale obtained a patent for a reinforced concrete roof structure.\nWithin a few years, he expanded his studio founded in Genoa, opening branches in major Italian cities such as Genoa, Milan, Rome, and Bologna, with industrialist Ernesto Dellepiane of Pontedecimo, establishing itself as one of the first companies specialized in reinforced concrete construction in Italy. In the following years, his company designed over 600 projects for a value of over twenty million lire, dealing with the supply of frameworks and design for dams, bridges, basins, gasometers, and other structures for the Italian State Railways, ministries, public and private entities.\nCannovale always alternated his entrepreneurial activity with design work. In 1908, he designed the distillery of Pontelagoscuro in Ferrara. In 1910, he was the author of the renowned Teatro Eden in Genoa, the so-called \"best known and most frequented among the variety venues\", inaugurated in 1910 and built in the Louis XV style. Attached to the theater was also a restaurant. Between 1919 and 1921, he carried out appraisals and was involved in the design of the Piero Gaslini Professional Institute in the municipality of Bolzaneto.\nRelocation to Rome\nIn the late twenties, with the increase in commissions, he moved to Rome, dealing with civil engineering but also urban planning, proposing, for example, a redevelopment project for the block between Piazza Cola di Rienzo and Via Valadier (with parts that received the favorable opinion of the building commission but were then ignored during co",

    "Verkhnii Saltiv is a historic-archaeological museum-reserve that is located near the village of Verkhnii Saltiv in Chuhuiv Raion, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine. The reserve covers one of the type sites of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, the main archaeological culture of the Khazars, with the other type site being Mayatskoye. Findings from the Verkhnii Saltiv archaeological complex are mostly displayed in museums of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Sofia, while only a small portion of them was kept in the museum in Verkhnii Saltiv.\nHistory\nThe settlement with traces of fortifications that is located near the village of Verkhnii Saltiv was first mentioned in \"Book to the Bolshoy Chertezh\" (17th century) as Saltanovskoye. It is located on the high right bank of Pechenih Reservoir on Siverskyi Donets River that rises above the floodplain by 35 m. The area has several defensive lines. The main fortification has the shape of an irregular trapezoid with dimensions 180 \u00d7 135 \u00d7 160 \u00d7 50 m. This territory was protected by a rampart with stone masonry. The settlement adjoins the fortifications from the north, stretching along the reservoir. Therefore, the ensemble of the Verknii Saltiv archaeological complex includes the fortifications, the settlement, four catacomb grave fields, as well as another settlement and Netailivskyi grave field that are located on the other side of the reservoir, opposite to the Verkhnii Saltiv settlement.\nIn 1900, a local teacher Vasyl Babenko received a request from the Committee of the preparation to the 12th Archaeological Congress to inform about the historical and archaeological monuments around the village of Verkhnii Saltiv. The first search works were carried out by Babenko. During the searches, a grave field was found. This finding prompted the Kharkiv University to send its representatives who confirmed the importance of the settlement. In 1901, archaeological research had begun. The discovery of the Saltiv necropolis caused further research, the result of which was the discovery of other objects in the archaeological complex.\nFrom 1905 to 1927, archaeological commissions of Kharkiv University, Kharkiv Archaeological Museum, Kharkiv Social Museum, Odesa Museum, and Moscow Archaeological Museum have carried out work in the region.\nBasic studies of defensive structures began after World War II. In 1946\u20131948, the scientist S. A. Semenov-Zuser made several cuts of ramparts on all three lines of defense of the ancient fortress and researched several dozens of catacomb burials.\nAn expedition was formed by the institute of archaeology in 1959 to further research the site. The goal of the expedition was the discovery of new archaeological monuments. As the result, the settlement and the grave field located on the left bank of the reservoir were discovered.\nFrom 1984, Kharkiv Historical Museum systematically sends expeditions to continue investigating Verkhnii Saltiv archaeological complex.\nThe site has been protected by the government since 21 July 1965 by the decree of the Council of Ministers of Ukrainian SSR. On 15 June 1987, the entire territory of Verkhnii Saltiv archaeological complex was proclaimed a protected reserve. In 1989, the historic-archaeological museum-reserve \"Verkhnii Saltiv\" was founded.\nThe area was under occupation during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Most of the exposition of the museum was transferred to Kharkiv prior to the occupation. The museum was severely damaged by missiles, and the parts of the archaeological site were mined. In May of 2022, the village of Verkhnii Saltiv was deoccupied.\nSources\n\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0410. \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u0421\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0456\u0432: \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0446\u044f: \u0406\u0441\u0442.-\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b. \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439-\u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a \u00ab\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u0421\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0456\u0432\u00bb: \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0456\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a / \u0410. \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u041d. \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u0421. \u041f\u043e\u0446\u0456\u043b\u0443\u0439\u043a\u043e.\u00a0\u2014 \u0425.: \u0413\u0456\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0456\u044f-\u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043c, 2003.\u00a0\u2014 51 \u0441.: \u0456\u043b\u044e\u0441\u0442\u0440.\u00a0\u2014 (\u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0456\u043d\u0435\u0446\u044c \u0425\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0438).\n\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u0421\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0456\u0432: \u0413\u0435\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u041c\u0456\u0441\u0446\u044f (\u0410.\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u041d.\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u0421.\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a).\u00a0\u2014 \u0425\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0456\u0432: \u0412\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0442\u0432\u043e \u00ab\u0413\u0456\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0456\u044f \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043c\u00bb, 2004.\u00a0\u2014 1200\u0441.; \u0456\u043b.\n",
    "Species of plant\nScybalium fungiforme is a species of parasitic plant in the family Balanophoraceae. It is commonly known as Cogumelo-de-caboclo in Brazil, where it is found. It was first described in 1832 by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott and Stephan Endlicher.\nDescription\nScybalium fungiforme is a parasite which feeds on the roots of other plants. The flowers are described as \"gory, red,  funguslike.\" The stem forms a lobed tuber. Leaf bracts are elliptical, adorned with pappus, and have margins that range from fimbrate to lacerate.  The arrangement of the inflorescence is dense. Stem flowers are funnel-shaped (infundibular), and the receptacle is disc-shaped (discoid).\nIt is commonly known by the name \"cogumelo-de-caboclo\" in Brazil. Other names include cogumelo-de-sangue, esponja-de-raiz, and fel-da-terra.\nTaxonomy\nScybalium fungiforme is a poorly known plant in the family Balanophoraceae. It is one of seven species of its family found in Brazil, and one of two members of its genus found there.\nDistribution\nThe distribution of Scybalium fungiforme is restricted to Atlantic forests in the Central-West and Southeast of Brazil, more so in forests below 1,400 metres (4,600\u00a0ft) sea level. Flora e Funga do Brasil notes that it is also found in the Central Brazilian Savanna. It prefers Gallery forest, Ombrophyllous forest,Riverine forest, and Seasonal semideciduous forest. It has been recorded in the following states: Esp\u00edrito Santo, Goi\u00e1s, Minas Gerais, Paran\u00e1, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo.\nConservation\nIn a 2008 review of plants of Brazil in the Lista de Amea\u00e7a de Flora e Fauna do Estado de Minas Gerais it was listed as \"vulnerable\".\nLife history\nPollination\nS. fungiforme flower with bracts intact.\nIt was theorized by Professor Patr\u00edcia Morellato of the S\u00e3o Paulo State University in the 1990s that the flowers of Scybalium fungiforme were pollinated by possums. This was because of the fact that the flowers were covered by sturdy scales (bracts), making it difficult for animals to be able to pollinate the flowers effectively. Opossums, with opposable thumbs, were potentially able to pollinate the flowers because of their dexterity. This was noted alongside the floral construction resembling that of Australian and South African members of the family Proteaceae which are associated with pollination by non-flying nocturnal mammals. Traits including dull coloration of the flowers, nocturnal anthesis paired with copious nectar production, and geoflory (flowering underground). Previous evidence of opossums with nectar on their snouts were unable to be recognized as evidence for the theory as there was no record of direct pollination by the opossums. Doctor Felipe Amorim would hypothesize later on that because of the flower's morphology, it would potentially be pollinated by a non-flying animal. Amorim's students had hypothesized the plant's pollination by rodents.\nObservations in the Serra do Japi Biological Reserve in May of 2019 confirmed Morellato's theory. Cameras that were placed on the site observed opossums (Didelphis aurita) removing the plant's bracts before inserting their faces into the flowers in order to consume its nectar. The montane grass mouse (Akodon montensis) was also recorded visiting S. fungiforme inflorescences.\nScybalium fungiforme's unique pollination syndrome entails possums, the plant's primary pollinator, who are uniquely capable of doing so, peeling the plants' bracts back in order to drink the plant's nectar. Secondary pollinators, such as bees (Apis mellifera, Trigona spinipes), wasps (Agelaia angulata), and hummingbirds (Thalurania glaucopis), would then drink the exposed flowers' nectar. While the plant's morphology is suited for ground-dwelling predators, the discovery of hummingbird pollinators for the plant were surprising to researchers.\n",

    "Italian Catholic place of worship\nThe Abbey of San Gerolamo is a Catholic place of worship located in the Quarto dei Mille district, on Via Redipuglia, in the municipality of Genoa in the Metropolitan City of Genoa. The church serves as the seat of the namesake parish in the vicariate of Quarto of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Genoa. The building is adjacent to the Giannina Gaslini Institute.\nHistory\nFoundation\nThe external cloister\nThe events that led to the origin of the abbey began in Spain during the Western Schism of the Catholic Church in the 14th century. Following the exile of the popes to Avignon and the subsequent alignment of European forces in support of either Pope Urban IV or Antipope Clement VII, King John I of Castile and Le\u00f3n sided with the antipope, creating an untenable situation in Spain: those who wished to remain Spanish citizens had to support the antipope or face exile. A group of Hieronymite monks, a newly established movement that professed the Rule of Saint Augustine, chose exile. Arriving in Genoa, they asked the Pope of Rome for permission to build a monastery dedicated to their protector, Saint Jerome, and on August 5, 1383, the Pope granted permission with a brief.\nThe monks did not arrive in Genoa by chance; Alfonso Pecha de Guadalati, a member of the congregation and brother of the Hieronymite founder and Bishop of Ja\u00e9n, had the fortune of being the confessor, advisor, travel companion, and editor of the writings of Saint Bridget of Sweden. During a journey and stay in Genoa with Saint Bridget, Alfonso Pecha discovered the location where the monastery would be built, which was then a green hillock near the Ligurian Sea. To confirm that Alfonso Pecha was the one who initiated the monastery, there is a sepulchral plaque, still visible inside the church, attributing the foundation of the monastic complex to him. After papal approval, the project progressed quickly, and on December 18, 1383, the Hieronymites purchased the land where the church still stands today for 1,100 Genoese lire. With the aid of alms and a contribution from the Benedictine monks of Santo Stefano, a significant portion of the work was completed.\nFour years later, in 1387, the first prior was elected, but he died shortly thereafter, as did many other monks of the community, which was quickly reduced to only two individuals: the founder Bishop Alfonso and Brother Innocenzo. Due to the grave situation, the bishop decided to transfer the foundation to the Olivetan Benedictine Congregation, which offered the assurance of completing the work he had started. Monks began arriving from Siena, forming a new community that, the following year, included another twelve monks, allowing the normal monastic life to resume.\nThe Olivetan Period\nThe bell tower\nThe first transformations were carried out by the Olivetan monks, who expanded the original apse to create the large Sancta Sanctorum, with the main altar at its center and the choir around it. After these initial transformations, the consecration of the main altar (1492) and the church (1495) took place.\nIn 1535, the monastery became an independent abbey with its own abbot. The position of abbot was often held by members of the most important Genoese families of the time (Adorno, Fieschi, Imperiale, Centurione), highlighting the spiritual and social significance the Abbey of San Gerolamo had gained over time. The proximity of such influential families facilitated the expansion and completion of the abbey's structures. The sacristy was built by Luciano Spinola, and the Spinola family later restored it in 1542 and again in 1609.\nIn 1487, Nicola Da Passano bequeathed funds for the construction of a chapel, which is the oratory chapel next to the main altar. At the end of the 15th century, the marble support for the main altar was added, which some historians claim is the sarcophagus of Agostino and Giovanni Adorno.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, side chapels were added, often used as tombs. In particular, around 1612, the Spinola family had the chapel of Saint Francesca Romana built, and in 1649, the chapel of the then-Blessed Bernardo Tolomei. In 1933, a partial recovery and restoration of the complex took place. In the late 1980s, the church underwent another restoration: the frescoed columns were recovered, the chapel of the crucifix was restored, some original frescoes on the architraves were uncovered, some paintings in the presbytery were restored, and the crucifix in the chapel of Saint Nicholas was also restored and cleaned.\nForced Abandonment and Conversion to Hospital\nLife continued undisturbed until 1797, when revolutionary movements and the arrival of Napoleon's army drove the monks out of the abbey, which was returned to them in 1815. Attempts to revive the abbey (even funded by King Charles Albert of Sardinia) were thwarted by the laws of 1855, which forced the monks to leave the abbey permanently.\nThe property was redeemed by the Ecclesiastical Fun",
    "1875 rifled breech loader gun by Krupp\nThe 35.5\u00a0cm Mantel Ring Kanone L/22.5 was a 35.5\u00a0cm 22.5 caliber long Krupp Mantel Ring Kanone (MRK). It was a rifled breech loader built-up gun with a Krupp cylindroprismatic sliding breech. It was exhibited at the 1876 Centennial Exposition and then bought by Russia. Meanwhile, another gun was sent to Turkey, which made it part of the Fortifications of the Dardanelles.\nContext\nThe race between armor and guns\nEngraving after a photo taken in Philadelphia\nDuring the 1860s, there was a continuous increase in the armor protection of ships. If the gun manufactureres kept up with this increase by a step by step increase in the caliber of their guns, this would naturally lead to an enormous collection of only slightly different guns doing more or less the same thing. In time, this would result in a lot of waste. The North German Federal Navy therefore wanted to have a caliber system with only a few calibers.\nIn 1869 it was decided that the coastal artillery of Prussia would have built-up guns (Ring Kanone) of: 15, 21, and 28\u00a0cm caliber. For the on board artillery, the question was complicated by ship sizes. Its heavy calibers would be: 15, 17, 21, 24 and 26\u00a0cm. In early 1873, the German Navy concluded that its coastal 28 cm RK L/22 gun would not be strong enough in the near future.\nKrupp enters the gun market\nKrupp was known for its capability to produce a type of crucible steel that, at the time, was of superior quality. Krupp then wanted to use this steel to make cannons. This met with quite some resistance, because these were traditionally made of cast iron or bronze. Krupp got its first major order for breech loading field guns in 1859. Krupp then wanted to expand its breech loading system to heavier calibers, but here it faced the competition of the Elswick Ordnance Company and others.\nIn 1868, Krupp tried to convince the North German Federal Navy to buy its 15, 21, and 24\u00a0cm caliber breechloader guns. In comparative trials of Krupp's 24 cm K L/20 against Elswick's RML 9-inch Armstrong Gun, the British muzzleloader proved superior at first. After Krupp was allowed to use a new type of gunpowder, it established the superiority of its gun over the Armstrong gun. The trials also put an end to the idea that breechloading was not suitable for heavy guns.\nMarketing\nSelling a product in a business to business market involves establishing relations with customers and convincing them that it is in their interest to buy your product. Krupp used all kinds of techniques to market its products. One of these was its presence at World's fairs. At the 1851 Great Exhibition in London, Krupp primarily showed its railway and other cast steel products. It also showed a 6-pounder muzzle-loading field gun and a cast steel ingot of 2,000\u00a0kg. The latter indicated an upper limit to the weight of Krupp guns which were made from a single cast.\nIn Paris Krupp was present at the Exposition Universelle (1855). It then showed a 5,000\u00a0kg ingot, different types of machinery, and a 12-pdr shell gun. It led to the French and other militaries ordering some guns to the test the Krupp product. At the 1862 International Exhibition in London, Krupp then exhibited a cast steel ingot of 20,000\u00a0kg and proved itself to be the foremost producer of crucible steel.\nKrupp's presence at World's fairs was useful to establish relations. Many fairs where visited by military delegations, but also by higher authorities who would otherwise not see the Krupp products. \nThe world's fairs also generated a lot of publicity for the company. This could be increased by showing masterpieces like: the biggest gun, the biggest steel ingot, etc. An example of this strategy was the 35.5\u00a0cm (1000-pdr) gun exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1867). This gun weighed c. 50,000\u00a0kg and was not built-up, but cast in a single piece. Other marketing techniques that Krupp used were sending gifts and inviting (military) authorities to study trips to Essen and the company's shooting grounds.\nThe successor to the 28 cm RK\nPhiladelphia Exposition photo\nAs mentioned above, in early 1873, the German Navy had concluded that its coastal 28 cm RK L/22 would not be powerful enough in the near future. It was not known what the caliber of the successor of the 28\u00a0cm RK L/22 had to be. Krupp had anticipated on this demand by producing the 30.5 cm RK L/22 in 1872. This gun was exhibited at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair. In 1874 Germany ordered three 30.5\u00a0cm RK L/22. It tested these in 1875, but the decision to buy a 30.5\u00a0cm gun (the 30.5 cm MRK L/22) would only be taken in 1876.\n1875 was a difficult year for Krupp. Meanwhile, the developments in armor and guns continued unabated. It was quite possible that the German Navy would not choose the 30.5\u00a0cm, and then Krupp would need to have an alternative. Krupp anticipated on the demand for an even stronger gun than the 30.5\u00a0cm by producing the first 35.5\u00a0cm Mantel Ring Kanone L/22.5 in 1875. At long ranges, 3",

The exact number of the Judges of the Constitutional Court is determined by article 125 of the Constitution of Russia. \nBy article 9 of the Federal Constitutional Law \"On the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation\", the Federation Council shall consider the question of the appointment of the Judge of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation in no event later than fourteen days after the receipt of the submission of the President of the Russian Federation. Proposals regarding candidates for offices of Judges of the Constitutional Court may be introduced to the President by Senators and by deputies of the State Duma, as well as by legislative bodies of federal subjects of Russia, supreme judicial bodies and federal legal departments, all-Russia law associations, legal research and educational institutions.\nAccording to article 8 of the Federal Constitutional Law \"On the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation\", in order to become a Judge of the Constitutional Court a person must be a citizen of Russia, at least 40 years of age, have legal education, have served as a lawyer for at least 15 years and have \"recognized high qualification\" in law.\nTerm length and number of judges\nJudges of the Constitutional Court (right) during Vladimir Putin's fourth inauguration ceremony, 7 May 2018\nThe rules for the term of office of a judge of the Constitutional Court have differed in various versions of the Constitutional Court Law.\nThe RSFSR Law \"On the Constitutional Court of the RSFSR\" settled the number of 15 judges, all appointed by the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia without an exact tenure, but with an age limit of 65.

    "\nWalter Pierrepont Brimble (16 October 1911 \u2013 1990) was a rugby league player who represented New Zealand. He played eight matches for New Zealand on their tour of Australia in 1938, becoming the 257th player to represent New Zealand. He also played three matches for Auckland in 1937\u201338, and one match for the North Island in 1938. He played senior club rugby union for Manukau from 1932 to 1936 and two games for Auckland B before switching to rugby league where he joined the Manukau club.\nEarly life\nWalter Brimble was born on 16 October 1911, in Molteno, Eastern Cape, South Africa. His father was Englishman Harold Pierrepont Brimble and his mother was (Jane) Depua Mahadna. She was a Bantu woman and worked as a nurse. Harold was originally working as a railways electrician from Bristol and had moved to South Africa as a 17-year-old with friends looking for work. While there he enlisted in the British Army and was badly wounded in the Boer War. Jane was his nurse and she nursed him back to health. They were married soon after and had five sons while living in South Africa before leaving apartheid South Africa on 9 March 1912. Their sons and ages when they departed South Africa were John (6), Cyril (4), Ted (2), and twins Walter and Lionel (4 months old). They originally moved to Australia, but their whites settlement law caused them to move again. They travelled to Sydney before boarding the Makura for Hawaii on 6 May 1912. While living in Honolulu for 2 years they had another son, Wilfred Brimble on 16 November 1913 who would also go on to represent New Zealand at rugby league.\nOn 21 April 1915, the family departed Honolulu, Hawaii destined for Auckland on board the SS Niagara. The family travelled in steerage. Harold's occupation was stated as \"salesman\", John and Cyril were \"students\" and Jane a \"housewife\". The whole family was listed, with ages in brackets as Harold P. (34), John (9), Cyril (7), Edward (Ted) (5 and a half), Lionel (3), Walter (3), Jane (30), and Wilfred (1). They were all listed as being English as nationality aside from Jane who was listed as \"African\" and Wilfred whose nationality was American as he had been born in Hawaii. The family settled in Onehunga, a modern-day suburb in central Auckland though at that time was considered more on the southern boundary of urban Auckland. While there a seventh son, Amyas, was born on 4 April 1917. Amyas and Harold both died in the Spanish Flu Epidemic; Harold died on 21 November 1917, aged 37, while Amyas died on 17 May 1920, aged 3.\nPlaying career\nThe first mention of Walter in the Auckland newspapers was for coming second in a race at the Manukau Cruising Club's annual regatta on February 20, 1926. The club was located on the shore of the Manukau Harbour in Onehunga. He was competing in the Boys' Race and his older brother Ted, who often went by the nickname \"Bunny\" came first. Older brothers Cyril and John placed in other races that were held. Aside from rugby union and rugby league it was mentioned in an article in The Rugby League News in Australia in 1938 that \"apart from football, the Brimbles have distinguished themselves in boxing and track athletics, and Walter won a caddies' golf championship. Walter and Lionel, the twins are keen yachtsmen\".\nRugby Union\nManukau Rovers Rugby Football Club\nThe first mention of him in association with rugby was being named in the team list for a 7th Grade match for Manukau Rovers against Green Lane on June 11, 1927. He was playing alongside twin brother Lionel. The following year on May 30 the Sun (Auckland) newspaper published a brief piece titled \"The Seven Brimbles\". It stated \"the stocky Brimble, who is always in the thick of any scrummage in which Manukau is implicated, belongs to a rugby family that puts all other claimants to the description into the shade. Besides this Brimble there are six more, each one them plays in a different grade for Manukau. That is there are seven grade teams, and seven Brimbles, one for each. Saturday in the Brimble family is a big day. Now bring on your records\". The article was slightly exaggerated in that there in fact were only 6 playing. After the death of father Harold, and youngest child Amyas around a decade earlier there were only 6 remaining males in the family. At the end of year prize giving Walter was presented with the Dodd Cup as captain of the 6th Grade side. The trophy was for the team with the highest aggregate number of points scored. In 1929 Walter and Lionel were still playing in the 6th Grade side. Their side won the 6th grade championship (Northern Roller Mills Cup) and were presented with their winners caps at Manukau's annual prizegiving along with the championship cup and the Dodd's Cup.\nWalter was not mentioned in relation to the Manukau rugby club in 1930, then in 1931 a \"W Brimble\" was granted a reinstatement to rugby union. It is likely this was Walter as Wilfred was two years his junior and less likely to have switched codes as he was only 1",

    "Former lifeboat station in County Meath, Ireland\nMornington Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station in the village of Mornington, on the south side of the River Boyne estuary, near Drogheda in County Meath, Ireland.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here, Drogheda (No.2), by the RNLI in 1872.\nMornington Lifeboat Station was closed in 1926.\nHistory\nOn passage from Newport, Monmouthshire to Dublin, the brig Manly\nwas driven onto the sands at Bettystown in a severe gale on 27 September 1871. Six of the crew of the Manly were lost. One person survived.\nFollowing the loss of the Manly, it was decided to open a No.2 station at Drogheda in 1872, located on the south side of the River Boyne at Mornington, County Meath. A boathouse was constructed near to the Maiden's Tower at Mornington. A 32-foot 10-oared Self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing (P&S) lifeboat was provided along with a launch carriage, both items being transported from London to Dublin free of charge by the British and Irish Steam Packet Company, arriving in July 1872. The lifeboat was funded from the bequest of English literary, art and music critic, and author Henry Fothergill Chorley, and named after his late brother John Rutter Chorley.\nAlthough the Baltray and Mornington stations were in close proximity across the river, each boat could be pulled on its carriage North or South respectively prior to launching, greatly reducing response times to vessels in distress along the coast. To prove the point, the Assistant Inspector of Lifeboats had the lifeboat quickly conveyed 3 miles south to Bettystown, the location of the Manly wreck.\nOn 2 February 1873, the John Rutter Chorley was launched to the schooner Wilson of Whitehaven. On passage to Cardiff, the vessel was driven ashore on the North Bull. With the vessel breaking up, 5 crew were rescued.\nIn some cases, many years could go by without a call for the lifeboat. 1877 would prove to be somewhat different, the Mornington lifeboat launching six times, and rescuing 24 people. On 11 January, 11 were rescued from the barque Sisters, on passage to Drogheda from Baltimore, Maryland, driven ashore at Laytown, County Meath. The steamship Urania ran aground on the North Bull just one week later on 18 January 1877. The lifeboat managed to rescue 10 of the 11 crew.\nFour more lifeboats would serve at Mornington, including the Charles Whitton (ON 334) from 1901 to 1902, transferred from the recently closed station across the River Boyne at Baltray, but with less sailing craft at the mercy of the weather, the Mornington lifeboat was only called 12 times between 1885 and 1926. Mornington Lifeboat Station was closed in 1926.\nThe boathouse next to the Maiden Tower still stands, and has recently been restored to be a private dwelling. The last lifeboat at Mornington, John Dunn (ON 638), was transferred to the flanking station at Clogherhead.\nMornington lifeboats\n^ ON is the RNLI's Official Number of the boat.\nPre ON numbers are unofficial numbers used by the Lifeboat Enthusiast Society to reference early lifeboats not included on the official RNLI list.\nSee also\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\nNotes\n^ 32-foot 10-oared Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, cost \u00a3251\n^ 34-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, cost \u00a3302\n^ 34-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, which cost \u00a3437 when new.\n^ 35-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, cost \u00a3838\n^ 35-foot Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, cost \u00a31,327\n",
    "2008 short story by Greg Egan\n\"Lost Continent\" is a science-fiction short story by Australian writer Greg Egan, first published in The Starry Rift edited by Jonathan Strahan in 2008. The short story was included in the collections Crystal Nights and Other Stories in 2009 and Oceanic in 2009. It also appeared in the anthology The Time Traveller\u2019s Almanac edited by Ann VanderMeer and Jeff VanderMeer in 2013.\nPlot\nAli and his friends are time travelers seeking refuge on a new continent. But bureaucracy treats them like numbers instead of humans and imprisons them in camps until their interview, which according to other refugees might take many months. Nobody knows when exactly their interview will finally happen and even afterwards, they will only advance from Stage One to Stage Two of the application process. After a few months in the camp, a group of activists visits to demonstrate. Police arrives to violently dissolve their gathering, but they still manage to get their message into the camp: If they give their numbers to the activists, they will receive letters from them. Ali and his friends all write their numbers, all they've ever been to authority in the camp, on a piece of paper and throw it over the fence attached to a stone, where it is picked up by an activist, who had waved at them with his hand. Looking forward to finally get treated like humans, Ali and his friends find new hope despite the total chaos around them.\nTranslation\nThe short story was translated into French (2009), Japanese by Makoto Yamagishi (2011 & 2019) and Chinese (2024).\nBackground\nIn the 2000s, Egan was active in campaigning for refugee rights, including the end of mandatory detention for asylum seekers in Australia, for a few years. In an interview with David Conyers for Virtual Worlds and Imagined Futures in 2009, Egan called it an \"eye-opening experience to see people mistreated in that way\", revealing that \"Lost Continent\" is \"an allegory of the whole thing, just to get some of the anger out of my system and move on.\" Egan further wrote about his experience and personal connections made with refugees in The Razor Wire Looking Glass in November 2003, an essay finished after his fifth journey to the immigration detention centre in Port Hedland:Of eight Afghanis I know who\u2019ve gone back, unable to bear detention any longer, six found the situation so perilous that they had to flee again. People returning to other countries have been arrested at the airport and imprisoned without charge or trial. In at least three cases documented by church groups, rejected asylum seekers returning from Australia have been murdered. That\u2019s the choice we\u2019re offering people: be delivered into the hands of your enemy, or stay here and rot in prison.  At the less subtle end of the spectrum, I know an Afghani man who was told, \u201cYes, the Taliban killed your father and your brother, so your father and your brother would have deserved visas, but you\u2019re safe here in front of me now, so how can you say you were in danger?\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine a more brutal catch-22. I also know people who\u2019ve been told, \u201cYour life would be in danger if you returned, but not for a reason covered by the refugee convention, so we don\u2019t owe you any kind of protection.\u201d\nReception\nReviews\nPublishers Weekly writes that \"steadfastly reductionist, Egan nevertheless makes room for the moral implications of the treatment of refugees.\"\nPaul Kincaid writes in Strange Horizons in a review of The Time Traveller's Almanac, that the short story \"is a heartfelt complaint about the way we treat refugees today, although the time travel element in the story is almost completely irrelevant.\"\nGreg Johnson writes on the SF Site, that the \"mix of here today reality and the imaginative use of science fictional elements is characteristic.\"\nAwards\nThe novel was a Locus Award Nominee for Best SF Novelette in 2009 and reached the 14th place.\n",
    "1993 short story by Greg Egan\n\"Transition Dreams\" is a science-fiction short story by Australian writer Greg Egan, first published in Interzone #76 in October 1993. The short story was included in the collections Our Lady of Chernobyl in 1995 and Luminous in 1998. The short story is set in the same universe as Egan's novel Diaspora.\nPlot\nThe protagonist pays the Gleisner corporation to scan his consciousness and transfer it in a Gleisner robot. Caroline Bausch tells him about a side effect called transition dream, which will be experienced by his consciousness during the scanning process but forgotten again. The protagonist is confused about the unnecessary information, but Caroline Bausch argues that to determine how a consciousness experiences a phenomenon, it has to be created and do so in the process. The protagonist later learns that the transition dreams are actually experienced by the packages of data of a consciousness saved and deleted again on different servers while sending it to another place. When learning that the transaction to the Gleisner corporation for the process has never really been made, the protagonist realizes to be in a transition dream and therefore the necessity to soon greet death.\nTranslation\nThe short story was translated into French by Sylvie Denis and Francis Val\u00e9ry (1996 & 2007), Italian (2001), Japanese by Makoto Yamagishi (2003), Spanish by Carlos Pav\u00f3n (2010). Czech by Petr Kotrle (2011), Chinese (2022) and Korean by Kim Sang-hoon (2024).\nThemes\nThe main concept of the short story is the process of scanning consciousness and create a digital version of a brain. Egan's other works also deal with this from different perspectives. This prominently includes the short story \"Learning to Be Me\", in which the main character is faced with an identity crisis caused by the technology, the novel Permutation City, which explores the metaphysics behind it on a very fundamental level (also including the separation of consciousness on different servers), and the novel Diaspora, in which humanity has already lived with scanning and in Gleisner robots for nine hundred years. In an interview with Carlos Pav\u00f3n for The Way Things Are in 1998, Egan argued against the concern about the latter (which is set in the same universe as \"Transition Dreams\") not \"going into all the philosophical issues of copying personalities\", that \"after exploring those issues in so many other things I\u2019ve written, there comes a point where both for me, and for people who\u2019ve read the other books and stories, there\u2019s nothing to be gained by going over the same old ground.\" In an interview with Marisa O\u2019Keeffe for noise!, Egan stated to be \"fairly sure that there\u2019ll be software in my lifetime that\u2019s conscious, though how it will first arise I don\u2019t know\" and to be worried \"that we might produce conscious software before we know it, and put the software through a lot of suffering without even realising it.\"\nReception\nJonathan Cowie, writing on concatenation.org, states that \"this story has Philip Dick elements but unlike any Dick story I have read its elements did not seem to quite fit.\"\n",
    "Clark with the Iowa Hawkeyes in 2024\nThe Caitlin Clark effect is the impact that American basketball player Caitlin Clark is reported to have on the popularity of women's basketball. Publications have used the term since Clark's collegiate career with the Iowa Hawkeyes, in which she drew unprecedented public interest to the sport. In 2023 and 2024, during her final two seasons at Iowa, her games set several attendance and television viewership records. After Clark was drafted by the Indiana Fever of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), analysts credited the Caitlin Clark effect for increases in WNBA attendance and viewership.\nBackground\nClark drew national attention as a junior for Iowa during 2023 NCAA tournament, where she set tournament records in points and three-pointers while helping her team achieve a runner-up finish. USA Today reporter Lindsay Schnell noted that Clark became a \"household name\" due to her play during the tournament. The 2023 national championship game set the women's college basketball viewership record with 9.9 million viewers. The Athletic writer Richard Deitsch wrote that Clark drew casual viewers to the title game, in part due to her long-range three-point shooting. Entering Clark's senior season in 2023\u201324, local media attributed increases in Iowa ticket sales to the \"Caitlin Clark effect\". During the 2023\u201324 season, the term was used by many publications, including BBC News, The Washington Post and USA Today, to describe Clark's general impact on the popularity of women's basketball, as measured by ticket prices, attendance and television viewership, among other factors.\nTelevision viewership\nClark drove historic levels of television viewership during her final two seasons at Iowa. At the conclusion of her college career, she was proclaimed the \"GOAT of TV Ratings\" by The Wall Street Journal, which wrote that her impact on television viewership exceeded any other modern athlete. The 2023 national championship game, which featured Clark, was the most-watched women's college basketball game in history, averaging 9.9 million viewers. On March 3, 2024, her game against Ohio State, in which she surpassed Pete Maravich to become the NCAA Division I all-time leading scorer, averaged 3.39 million viewers. It was the most-watched women's regular season college basketball game on Fox and on any network since 1999. Clark's first three games in the 2024 NCAA tournament each became the most-viewed women's college basketball games prior to the Final Four. Her Elite Eight game against LSU (12.3 million), which was a rematch of the 2023 national title game, and her Final Four contest against UConn (14.2 million) each broke the women's college basketball viewership record. The 2024 national championship game, where Clark played against South Carolina, again set the women's college basketball viewership record with 18.9 million viewers and was the most-watched basketball game since 2019. It was the first NCAA women's basketball title game to outdraw the men's title game.\nClark continued to set viewership records upon entering the WNBA. The 2024 WNBA draft, where the Indiana Fever selected Clark with the first overall pick, averaged 2.45 million viewers, the most in WNBA draft history. It was also the most-watched WNBA telecast since 2000. Clark's regular season debut against the Connecticut Sun on May 14, 2024, was the most-watched WNBA game since 2002 and the most-watched ever on ESPN2 or any cable network. On May 18, her game against the New York Liberty set the league's ABC viewership record with 1.71 million viewers. In the following week, Clark's games set WNBA viewership marks on ESPN, Ion and NBA TV.\nGame attendance\nClark has driven increases in home and away attendance for her games. Entering her senior season, her Iowa team sold out all of its home games for the first time, after previously selling out only three regular season games in program history. On October 15, 2023, Iowa held a preseason exhibition game against DePaul at Kinnick Stadium, which set the women's basketball single-game attendance record at 55,646. Iowa sold out or set an attendance record in all but two regular season games, both at the Gulf Coast Showcase during the Thanksgiving weekend. Her November 9 game against Virginia Tech, held at a neutral site in Charlotte, North Carolina, had the highest attendance (15,196) for any women's college basketball game in state history. Teams that reported attendance records while hosting Iowa included Wisconsin (14,252), Ohio State (18,660),, and Nebraska (15,042), and Northwestern recorded its first sellout against the Hawkeyes. Iowa set the Big Ten single-season average attendance record (14,998), surpassing its own mark from the previous season (11,143). Her regular season finale against Ohio State, in which she passed Maravich as the NCAA Division I all-time leading scorer, was the most expensive women's college basketball game of all time, with an average ",

    "Japanese glass artist\nHisakichi Asahara (Japanese: \u6d45\u539f \u4e45\u5409, Hepburn: Asahara Hisakichi, July 17, 1877 \u2013 October 16, 1957) was a Japanese glass artist. A pioneer in glass crafts making, he was the founder of Otaru glass industry during the Meiji era, that evolved into a \"glass town\", where many glass factories have been established.\nBiography\nHisakichi Asahara was born on July 17, 1877, in Fukuoka, Kyushu, the birthplace of Satsuma kiriko. His parents' home in Hakata used to be a glass factory that had been around since the Edo period, now closed down. He went to work as an apprentice at a glass factory opened in Osaka, but later moved to Hakodate for training and accompanied a senior craftsman to started his own company.\nThen, he became independent and moved to Otaru, during its development period, on his own as a glass blower and founded Asahara Glass, the predecessor of the famous shop Kitaichi Glass established after one of their shore was closed in 1971, a company to manufacture miscellaneous glass household items, such as oil lamps and medication bottles, in 1903 in Tomioka. He established the manufacturing technology and started producing kerosene lamps, that were part of life's necessities because electricity supply was unknown at that time, and medication bottles.\nIn 1908, he was asked by the Fisheries Research Institute at the time if it would be possible to make glass fishing floats, which were previously made of wood and bamboo, out of glass that was cheaper, lighter, easier to process, and transparent enough to blend in with the color of the seawater. Those request arrived words inspired him through extensive research, and so he devised a technique called \"glass-blowing\", which was passed down from him and continued for a hundred years along with the history of Hokkaido's fishing industry.\nDuring the Meiji and Taish\u014d periods, glass floating balls invented by him for local fishermen using recycled glass were quickly used as buoyancy bodies to float ropes when fishing for herring and northern sea, although nowadays similar balls are in demand as home decorations. He gathered his brothers and relatives together, taught them glass-making techniques of hand-blown spheres, and around 1940 expanded his Asahara Glass factories across Hokkaido (Otaru, Muroran, Kushiro, Asahikawa, and Sakhalin), and the number of employees increased to about 400, making it one of the largest companies in Hokkaido at the time: it is said that 1,056 tons of floating balls were produced in 1947, but it can be assumed that the actual amount was more than that.\nIn 1934, he moved to Midori, Irifune, and then to its current location in Tenjin. According to lifestyle changes, their products have shifted to tableware to enrich people's lives. They always try to supply products that enhance the quality of life. By the 1920-30s, they were sending out millions of glass floats for use on boats fishing the Pacific Ocean, sealed with their so-called \"buttons\" blank. However, after the end of the war, business gradually declined in prosperity because of the use of electric lights, aluminum and orange plastic floating balls during the Sh\u014dwa period, and Asahara Glass is the only company in the country that, rather than developing new products, still continues to make and sell oil lamps and glass floating balls as interior decoration souvenirs.\nAfter retired in June 1950, he died in Otaru on October 16, 1957, and was laid to rest in Asahara's local grave. His progeny succeeded him: his eldest son Torai Asahara inheriting the name \"Hisakichi Asahara II\" until his death on May 9, 1979; his grandson Y\u014dji Asahara from 1967 to his death on September 7, 2007; and now his eldest great-grandson Saiichir\u014d Asahara.\n",
    "The Sgurr Beag Thrust is an important tectonic structure within the Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rock sequences of the Scottish Highlands. The thrust, or similar structures correlated with it, form the boundary between rocks of the Glennfinnan Group and the underlying Morar Group. It divides the Wester Ross Supergroup from the Loch Ness Supergroup. The history of this structure remains poorly understood although it is thought to be at least partly of Caledonian age.\nExtent\nThe Sgurr Beag Thrust was identified as a zone of high strain in the western part of the Highlands and was originally called the \"Sgurr Beag Slide\". It is currently interpreted to extend from the Morvern peninsula in the southwest (with a possible extension onto the Isle of Mull), to the Dornoch Firth where it disappears beneath the Old Red Sandstone. It is often marked by the presence of inliers of Lewisian basement, which are found in its hanging-wall (structurally above the fault plane). In eastern Sutherland there are several thrust structures that could correlate with the Sgurr Beag Thrust, particularly the Swordly Thrust or the Skinsdale Thrust.\nAge\nThe Loch Ness Supergroup has a depositional age range extending to about 850 Ma (million years ago).There are two main tectonic/metamorphoic events that have affected this sequence since its deposition, the Knoydartian Orogeny (a series of events 820\u2013725 Ma) and the Caledonian Orogeny (consisting of the Grampian Orogeny and the Scandian Phase, mid Ordovician to early Devonian). The age of peak metamorphism within the rocks above the thrust is dated to 840\u2013720 Ma, the timing of the Knoydartian event(s). Some mineral growth is of Scandian age, but it remains unclear as to when the Sgurr Beag Thrust moved, although there is evidence of two phases of movement, possibly of Knoydartian and Scandian age. A contrast between the pre-Caledonian metamorphic histories of the Morar Group and the Loch Ness Group above the Sgurr Beag Thrust suggest that the final large-scale movement on the thrust was of Caledonian age.\n",
    "Swedish baroness and patron of arts\nMaria Gyllenstierna af Lundholm (born in 1716, died in 1783) was a Swedish baroness and a patron of arts. Gyllenstierna af Lundholm was married to baron Esbj\u00f6rn Kristian Reuterholm (1710\u20131773). The couple resided at Suitia Manor in Siuntio in present-day Finland. Their son, Baron Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm (1756\u20131813), was during the regency of Gustav IV Adolf, from 1792 to 1796, the true ruler of the Kingdom of Sweden, as the King was a minor.\nArt in Finland\nAltar painting in St. Peter's Church in Siuntio.\nMaria Gyllenstierna af Lundholm donated an altarpiece to the St. Peter's Church in Siuntio, depicting Christ in Gethsemane. The altarpiece was painted in Stockholm by an unknown artist. This new altarpiece features gilded frames with the coats of arms of the Reuterholm and Gyllenstierna af Lundholm families at the bottom.\nIn 1774, the cathedral chapter granted Maria Gyllenstierna af Lundholm a specific burial right. Therefore, Siuntio parish gave her the right to construct a burial chapel adjacent to St.Peter's Church. The Reuterholm burial chapel was built of granite next to the church's eastern wall, near the sacristy. The chapel had an entrance from the church, north of the altar. A gilded monument in a form of an urn was located inside the burial chapel. The walls were decorated with 13 oval-shaped paintings depicting symbolic figures, and four rectangular paintings with different verses written on them. The burial chapel features iron gates, showing the baronial initials, CH. R. H for Christian Reuterholm and M. G. S. for Maria Gyllenstierna af Lundholm, along with another iron gate, both of which are still in place.\nIn 1815, all removable items were evacuated from the chapel to Sweden after Suitia Manor and all of Finland had become a part of the Russian Empire as the result of the Finnish War. Following the fire in St. Peter's Church in 1823, the church's sacristy and vestibule were demolished. At the same time, the sacristy was moved to the emptied Reuterholm burial chapel.\n",

    "American bull rider (1969\u20131994)\nBrent Cullen Thurman (March 3, 1969 \u2013 December 17, 1994) was an American professional rodeo cowboy who specialized in bull riding. He competed in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), Bull Riders Only (BRO), and Professional Bull Riders (PBR) circuits; the last organization of which he was one of the founding members.\nEarly life\nBrent Thurman was born on March 3, 1969, in Austin, Texas, to Will Thurman and Kay Goodnight. He had an older brother, Brock, who was two and a half years his senior. He grew up in Dripping Springs, Texas. His maternal great-great-great uncle was famous cattle rancher Charles Goodnight.\nThurman's bull riding career began at the age of eight. He also played football, basketball, and golf, and ran track. He won a city golf tournament when he was in high school, but remained focused primarily on bull riding.\nCareer\nThurman joined the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) in 1989.\nHe was a three-time qualifier to the PRCA's Texas Circuit Finals Rodeo.\nHe joined Bull Riders Only (BRO) in 1991, during its inaugural year, and competed at the first BRO Finals at the Long Beach Sports Arena in Long Beach, California, in March 1992.\nIn April 1992, Thurman was one of the 21 co-founders of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR). Later in October of that year, he rode at his second BRO Finals; this time at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado.\nThurman volunteered in special rodeos; competitions for physically and mentally disabled youth, and was a judge at bull-riding events throughout Texas in his spare time.\nHe competed at his third BRO Finals in 1993; the event having returned to Long Beach, California. That same year, he qualified for and competed at his first National Finals Rodeo (NFR), the PRCA's annual year-end world championship rodeo at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIn 1994, Thurman competed during the first Bud Light PBR Tour season and qualified for the inaugural PBR Bud Light World Finals in Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena in October.

According to his then-girlfriend, Tara Farrell, the normally laidback Thurman nervously asked fellow bull rider Aaron Semas his thoughts about the bull before they arrived at the Thomas & Mack Center.\nHalfway into the ride, Thurman was bucked off and became entangled in his bull rope, which pulled him underneath Red Wolf's hooves and was stomped on the back of his head and neck by the bull's back hooves. Then, Thurman, lying on the arena floor on his left side, kept his head up briefly before slowly lowering it to the ground, losing consciousness. He was quickly tended to by the Justin Sports Medicine Team and rushed out of the arena on a stretcher to University Medical Center's trauma center with severe cranial and facial fractures. Thurman was in a coma and on life support; subsequently succumbing to his injuries six days later, having never regained consciousness. He was 25 years old. Red Wolf was not considered vicious for a bull, and the death was ruled a \"freak accident.\"\nThurman's funeral was held on December 22, 1994, at the Travis County Exposition Center in Austin, Texas.\nThurman's father Will died on February 17, 2006, at the age of 66 after battling cancer. His older brother Brock died on July 28, 2021, at the age of 54.\nHonors\nIn 1996, the PBR introduced the Lane Frost/Brent Thurman Award; presented to the bull rider with the highest-marked single ride at the annual PBR World Finals. It was named for Thurman and Lane Frost, who died at the 1989 Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo, also killed in a bull-riding accident.\nFrom 1999 through 2017, the Brent Thurman Memorial Bull Riding, a PBR-sanctioned event was held in Thurman's honor to raise money for charity.\nIn 2002, Thurman was posthumously inducted into the Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame.\nSince 2007, the Brent Thurman Foundation has raised funds to serve the special needs community in and around Austin, Texas.\nIn 2008, the City of Las Vegas named a frontage road after Thurman; Brent Thurman Way.\nIn 2011, Thurman was posthumously inducted into the PBR Ring of Honor.\n",
    "Australian TV channel\nTelevision channel\n10 Peach Comedy is an Australian free-to-air television channel operated by Network 10. It was launched on 11 January 2011 as Eleven. It is owned by ElevenCo, which was established as a joint venture between Ten Network Holdings and CBS Studios International; the latter would ultimately acquire Network 10 in 2017.\nThe channel focuses primarily on programming targeting a young adult audience, and was the home of Neighbours\u2014the longest-running drama series on Australian television. Prior to the launch of 10 Shake in September 2020, the channel also aired children's programming.\nHistory\nPrior to the launch of the channel, Ten Network Holdings, at the time an independent company, established a joint venture company named ElevenCo with international distributor CBS Studios International. Ten held a two-thirds equity stake in the venture, with CBS holding the remaining share. Under the arrangement, Eleven gained access to programming from CBS's back catalogue. Ten Network Holdings entered administration in 2017 and was subsequently acquired by CBS Corporation, ultimately giving CBS full ownership of Eleven. CBS ultimately merged with Viacom, making 10 Peach a sister network to MTV and Nickelodeon.\n10 Peach\nOn 31 October 2018, the channel rebranded as 10 Peach, as part of a larger rebranding of Network Ten. The new name is intended to provide a clearer scope for the channel's programming; Network 10's chief content officer Beverley McGarvey described \"Peach\" as feeling \"relaxed\" and \"almost a guilty pleasure\" to viewers, with programmes such as Neighbours, Supernatural, This Is Us, and Will & Grace, and would attempt to represent all that the peach fruit itself stood for.\nOn 5 June 2024, it was announced that the channel would rebrand as 10 Peach Comedy on 12 June 2024, as part of a rebranding of Bold and Peach to reflect their current genre positionings.\nProgramming\n10 Peach offers catch-up and encore presentations from Channel 10. It features a mix of repeated classic programs, new shows to Australian television, and shows that would make their debut on Australian free-to-air television.\nMost of the classic programming on 10 Peach comprises 80's, 90's and 2000's comedies and dramas sourced from Paramount Television, CBS Studios and CBS Studios International (via parent company Paramount Global).\nSome of Ten's shows aimed at a younger demographic, most notably Neighbours, were moved to Eleven for the launch of the new channel. This was part of Ten's re-branding to target the older demographic. The decision to move Neighbours and other shows was to also make way for a new current affairs show in Ten's 6:00\u20137:00pm timeslot. In 2015 Neighbours was Eleven's highest-rating program and the number-one regular Australian program on the digital multichannels, averaging 278,000 viewers.\nOn 27 February 2012, Toasted TV was moved from Ten to Eleven due to a number of changes to their morning line-up, which included the launch of Breakfast. On 4 November 2013, more of Ten's shows including Totally Wild, Scope, Wurrawhy and Mako: Island of Secrets moved due to the launch of Wake Up and Studio 10. Other first-run Australian content on 10 Peach includes Couch Time, The Loop and Bondi Ink Tattoo.\nOn 6 April 2020, a six-hour programming block of Nickelodeon children's content was added to the network, which aired under the Toasted TV branding. This ran until 27 September, when children's programming was entirely moved to 10 Shake. Toasted TV was cancelled, with its final episode airing on 18 September.\nCurrent programming\nAdult animation\nSouth Park (2023\u2013present)\nComedy\nBecker\nThe Big Bang Theory\nFrasier\nFriends (Shared with Nickelodeon)\nThe King of Queens\nThe Middle (shared with Nickelodeon)\nMom (Shared with Nickelodeon)\nThe Neighborhood\nTwo and a Half Men\nDrama\nNeighbours (shared with Network 10)\nLight entertainment\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\nUpcoming Programming\nComedy\nFormer programming\nAdult animation\nThe Cleveland Show (moved to 10 Shake later Disney+)\nBob's Burgers (moved to Disney+)\nBordertown\nDuckman\nFuturama (moved to 7flix and Disney+)\nKing of the Hill\nPacific Heat\nThe Simpsons (moved to 7flix and Disney+)\nSon of Zorn\nUnsupervised\nChildren's (2012\u201320)\nThe Adventures of Chuck and Friends\nThe Amazing Spiez!\nB-Daman Crossfire\nBaby Animals in Our World (2016\u201318)\nBakugan\nBarbie: Life in the Dreamhouse\nThe Barefoot Bandits (2016\u201320)\nBeyblade (Now on 9Go!)\nBeyblade Metal Fury\nBeyblade: Metal Fusion\nBeyblade: Metal Masters\nBeyblade: Shogun Steel\nBeyWarriors: BeyRaiderz\nBeyWheelz\nBlazing Team: Masters of Yo-Kwon-Do\nThe Bureau of Magical Things (2018\u201320)\nCardfight!!

    "Zoo in Kotor, Montenegro\nAquarium Boka (Adriatic Biodiversity Conservation Center \u2033Aquarium Boka\u2033; Serbian: Centar za o\u010duvanje morskog biodiverziteta \u2033Akvarijum Boka\u2033) is the organizational unit of the Institute for Marine Biology of the University of Montenegro, founded in 2020, and it was officially opened to the public in June 2021. It is the first and only public aquarium in Montenegro, and in the first three months, the Aquarium was visited by more than 8,000 people.\nThe aquarium is located in the Radoni\u010di\u0107 Palace, which was built at the beginning of the 19th century.\nThe Institute for Marine Biology is a unique institution in Montenegro that combines research and education to promote and practice the efficient conservation of marine wildlife.\nHistory\nThe Institute of Marine Biology in Kotor (IMB) is the only institution in the southern Adriatic involved in the study, protection, and conservation of marine biodiversity and water catchment areas. Thirty years ago, a specialized laboratory was formed, with infrastructure for growing and studying the biology and ecology of marine and freshwater organisms (aquariums, circular pools, cold rooms, etc.). However, this part of the IMB is no longer functional and without reconstruction, its further use for research and public purposes is not possible.\nThe IMB is granted by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to implement a project \u2033Marine Biodiversity Conservation Center Boka Aquarium \u2013 MonteAqua\u2033. The project is under implementation between December 4, 2017, and June 1, 2020. The planned project's effect on society is enhanced Montenegrin EU integration process in the area of nature protection relevant to water ecosystems and sustainable management of protected water ecosystems. One of the main activities of the MonteAqua project is building reconstruction of the ground floor of the IMB, of about 300 sqm. It is creating infrastructural pre-conditions to host the Center for Marine Biodiversity Conservation with Aquarium Boka and Kotor Adriatic Rescue Center for marine wildlife. Funds are also allocated for purchasing the equipment for the aquarium.\nConcept and organisation\nThe center has two units: a public aquarium and a rescue center for sea turtles. Aquarium has 18 tanks divided into four exhibition units:\nThe World Sea and Mediterranean Sea,\nAdriatic Sea and South Adriatic,\nBoka Bay and\ntropical seas.\nThe Marine Biodiversity Conservation Center \u201cAquarium Boka\u201d is a unique institution in Montenegro that integrates research and education for promoting and practicing effective conservation on behalf of the sea's wildlife. Aquarium builds public awareness and action for protecting Adriatic Sea species and habitats, but also actively contributes to various conservation solutions and serve as role models. The establishing of the center is especially important from the aspect of opening the possibilities for closer cooperation between science and business entities, particularly those engaged in fishing, as well as aquaculture, production of fish, and seafood products. Rescue Center develops capacities in Montenegro for rescuing endangered sea species. The center as a whole strengthens the position of Montenegro in terms of regional and international scientific cooperation in the field of conservation of biological resources of aquatic ecosystems. And most importantly, Aquarium moves people to act on behalf of the marine species we seek to protect.\nAdriatic Biodiversity Conservation Center \u2033Aquarium Boka\u2033 operates in three directions:\nprotection of endangered species, their preservation in controlled conditions and possible future repopulation,\npublic education and\nnew attraction in the tourist offer of the city of Kotor.\nContents\nThe Center for the Preservation of Biodiversity of the Adriatic \"Aquarium Boka\" promotes the necessity of preserving biodiversity. In addition to the rich collection with more than 60 species of marine organisms, some fascinating facts can be discovered in the Boka Aquarium about: World sea, Mediterranean Sea, Adriatic Sea, Seahorses, Fish of the Adriatic Sea, Sharks and Rais, Octopus, Moray and Conger eels, Jellyfish, Sea urchins and Starfish, Sea turtles, introduced and invasive species, Bay of Kotor etc.\nThe species in the Aquarium are inhabited from nature, because it is a much cheaper way of obtaining species, but the maintenance of these organisms is very difficult. These are usually organisms from the wild that are brought by numerous sports and commercial fishermen, or collected by the scientists and researchers of the institute during fieldwork. There are also special procedures for how some of these organisms will be caught and preserved, because not every caught fish can survive the physical injuries they suffer. All new organisms that arrive at Boka Aquarium from the wild must undergo a special 15-day quarantine in special pools, in the technical part of the building, before being introduced into the tanks. During that p",

    "\nEvents in 1885 in animation.\nEvents\nUntil Autumn 1885: From spring 1884 to Autumn 1885, Eadweard Muybridge and his team produced over 100,000 images, mostly at an outdoor studio on the grounds of the University of Pennsylvania's northeast corner of 36th and Pine, recording the motions of animals from the veterinary hospital, and from humans: University professors, students, athletes, Blockley Almshouse patients, and local residents. Thomas Eakins worked with him briefly, although the painter preferred working with multiple exposures on a single negative, whereas Muybridge preferred capturing motion through the use of multiple cameras. Since 1879, Muybridge was working on the zo\u00f6praxiscope (animal action viewer), a projection device that created cyclical animations of animal movement, incorporating technologies from photography, the magic lantern and the zoetrope. The photographer created painted sequences on the glass zo\u00f6praxiscope discs that were based on his motion-study photographs to produce an early form of animation. Muybridge used these to illustrate his lectures that were presented to audiences in the U.S. and Europe, marking his contribution to photography and film in relation to the \"experience of time within modernity.\"\nBirths\nFebruary\nFebruary 22: Pat Sullivan, Australian animator, cartoonist, and film producer (Felix the Cat), (d. 1933).\nApril\nApril 3: Bud Fisher, American cartoonist (creator of the comic strip Mutt and Jeff,  credited as the writer, animator, and director of the strip's animated adaptations which were released by the Fox Film Corporation, although the majority of the animation was instead created by Raoul Barr\u00e9 and Charles Bowers), (d. 1954).\nAugust\nAugust 6: Harry O.

    "Municipal building in Bodmin, Cornwall, England\nBodmin Guildhall is a historic building in Fore Street in Bodmin, a town in Cornwall, in England. The structure, which was used for municipal purposes before being converted for use as a baker's shop and restaurant, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe ivory casket that was held in the guildhall from the mid-16th century to the early 20th century\nThe building was commissioned as a meeting place for the ancient borough of Bodmin. The site the borough leaders selected had been occupied by St Petroc's Guild of Skinners and Glovers. The building was designed in the medieval style, built in rubble masonry with granite dressings and dates back to around the time that the royal charter was granted in 1536. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto Fore Street. A cross-wing was added behind the main structure in the 17th century. The cross-wing was fenestrated at the east end by a stained glass window which depicted, in each of the four quadrants, the arms of four nations of the United Kingdom.\nThe Methodist cleric, John Wesley, preached at the guildhall in August 1779, and the lord of the manor, Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville, presented a royal coat of arms which was installed above the doorway in 1807. Following the implementation of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, the feudal borough officials were replaced by an elected council, which continued to hold its meetings in the building.\nIn 1906, the council reconstructed the front portion of the building, and renovated the remainder, to provide a dedicated council chamber.  The cross-wing was further fenestrated on the south side by a stained glass window which depicted, in each of the four quadrants, the royal arms, the county arms, the borough arms, and the arms of the local priory. Following the renovations, the ground floor comprised an entrance hall and waiting room, the first floor had the council chamber and town clerk's office, the second floor was the surveyor's office, and there was a storeroom on the third floor. An ivory casket, which had contained the bones of Saint Petroc at Bodmin Priory until they were destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries, was retained in the guildhall until at least the early 20th century,  when it was removed to St Petroc's Church.\nBy the mid-1940s, the borough council needed extra space and, in 1948, it relocated to Priory House, the former home of William Pennington, in Priory Road, which itself dated from 1790. Shop fronts were then inserted into the guildhall at ground floor level, and in 1949, the building was grade II listed. Following local government organisation in 1974, the guildhall was used by Bodmin Town Council as a meeting place and this continued until May 1983, when the building was sold to the local baker, Malcolm Barnecutt, for use as a baker's shop and restaurant. Town council meetings were subsequently held at the Shire Hall.\nArchitecture\nThe building is constructed of rubble with granite dressings, with rendered studwork at the front.  Its roof is largely covered with slates, but partly with bitumen. The central doorway, which is flanked by a pair of Ionic order columns supporting an entablature may be original, and above it is a royal coat of arms affixed in the central bay on the first floor which is otherwise blind. The outer bays on the first floor are fenestrated by large tri-partite sash windows flanked by brackets supporting cornices, while the second floor is fenestrated by two more tri-partite sash windows with a single sash window installed between them. The cross-wing at the rear is fenestrated by four original mullioned windows.\n",
    "This article is about a planned bridge in Baltimore. For other articles, see Key Bridge (disambiguation).\nBridge in Maryland, U.S.\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge replacement is a project to replace the Francis Scott Key Bridge in greater Baltimore, Maryland, United States.\nThe Key bridge collapsed on March 26, 2024, after a container ship struck one of its piers. The southernmost crossing of the lower Patapsco River, the bridge was part of the Interstate Highway System and a major piece of the region's transportation infrastructure: a well-trafficked part of the Baltimore Beltway (Interstate 695 or I-695) linking Dundalk in Baltimore County and the Hawkins Point neighborhood of Baltimore. It crossed the deep-water shipping channel leading to the Port of Baltimore, one of the country's busiest ports.\nOfficials at the Maryland Department of Transportation have announced plans to replace the bridge by fall 2028 at an estimated cost of $1.7\u00a0billion to $1.9\u00a0billion.\nHistory\nIn the early morning of March 26, 2024, the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed after the container ship Dali struck one of its piers. Operated by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA), the bridge was the outermost of three toll crossings of Baltimore's harbor, along with the Baltimore Harbor and Fort McHenry tunnels. The bridge carried an estimated 11.5\u00a0million vehicles annually, including many trucks carrying hazardous materials that are prohibited in the tunnels. It was a steel arch-shaped continuous truss bridge, the second-longest in the United States and third-longest in the world.\nIn an address later that day, President Joe Biden said that he would ask Congress to fund a replacement bridge. On March 28, the federal government released an initial $60\u00a0million in emergency aid under the Emergency Relief (ER) Program of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) that is subsidized by the Highway Trust Fund. Buttigieg also urged Congress to provide funding for a replacement bridge. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that it was the federal government's responsibility to absorb the costs.\nOn April 5, the House Freedom Caucus issued a statement listing conditions for their support of funding for a replacement bridge, including that the federal government seek maximum liability from the shipping companies upfront, that funding only draw upon available federal funds and be offset with budget cuts, that various federal regulations be waived, and that the Biden administration lift its pause on liquefied natural gas exports. Ben Cardin, U.S. senator from Maryland, vowed to hold those responsible for the bridge collapse accountable, but argued against waiting for related litigation to be resolved and insurance claims to be approved, saying, \"We're not going to delay opening our channel or rebuilding our bridge with the lengthy process that may take\", with which Buttigieg agreed. On April 8, Moore said he would talk with members of Congress the following week about funding a replacement bridge. At an April 10 hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, ranking member Ted Cruz of Texas said the federal government \"needs to help rebuild the bridge,\" but also argued that legal protections to protect taxpayers from the costs of litigation should be implemented and expressed concern about potential bureaucratic delays.\nWhile some engineering professors suggested that replacing the bridge could take as long as 10 years and cost at least $350\u00a0million, a report issued by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) noted that replacement bridges can qualify for a Categorical Exclusion (CE) under the National Environmental Policy Act to accelerate regulatory review and project delivery. The report also noted that the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge that replaced the I-35W Mississippi River bridge was completed in 11 months with the help of a CE, while repairs to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge took five years to complete.\nThe CRS report notes that a replacement bridge project could be eligible to receive up to 80% of its funding from the FHWA ER Program since the bridge was a state highway, 90% if the expenses cause the state government to exceed its federal-aid highway program funds for the fiscal year, or 100% of the project cost if Congress makes an exception for the project from the ER Program rules (which Congress did for the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge), while any state funds received from an approved insurance claim would offset funding awarded from the ER Program. However, the ER Program has a $2.1\u00a0billion backlog of emergency relief reimbursements to states and only $890\u00a0million on hand. Policy scholars at the Eno Center for Transportation have suggested that a replacement bridge could qualify for funding under the Bridge Investment Program created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\nOn April 9, the Maryland congressional delegation announced that they would introduce a bill to make an exception to the ER Program rules for a rep",

He was one of two co-signatories of the Treaty of Trianon for Hungary, alongside Alfr\u00e9d Drasche-L\u00e1z\u00e1r.\nEarly life\n\u00c1gost Ben\u00e1rd de Szilv\u00e1gy was born on 3 January 1880 in Budapest. His parents were Lajos Ben\u00e1rd (1827\u20131885) and Em\u00edlia G\u00e1sp\u00e1r (1838\u20131907). His father was an employee of the Ministry of National Defense, and was given the noble title \"de Szilv\u00e1gy\" in 1877, from his hometown of Szilv\u00e1gyi.\nBen\u00e1rd attended a Piarist gymnasium in Pest and graduated from University of Budapest in 1905 with a medical degree. While in university, he engaged in political activism, organizing student protests in the aftermath of the 1905 parliamentary election.\nCareer\nAfter his graduation, Ben\u00e1rd began training to be a surgeon in Paris and Vienna. In 1909, he was hired by the Workmen's Insurance Society (Munk\u00e1sbiztos\u00edt\u00f3 P\u00e9nzt\u00e1r) of Hungary to be a physician for members of the society.\nIn 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Ben\u00e1rd enlisted in the Honv\u00e9d as a combat medic. He served for a total of fifty months as a doctor on the front lines of the war until 1917. In November 1918, Ben\u00e1rd began organizing armed demonstrations against Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi following the Aster Revolution. When the First Hungarian Republic collapsed in March 1919, Ben\u00e1rd was arrested by the newly-formed Hungarian Soviet Republic government for organizing anti-revolutionary activities and was sentenced to death. The day before his execution was set to be carried out, he escaped and fled to Vienna.\nWhile in Vienna, Ben\u00e1rd joined the Antibolsevista Comit\u00e9, an anti-Bolshevik organization led by Istv\u00e1n Bethlen, which convinced him to pursue a career in politics. With the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in August 1919, Ben\u00e1rd returned to Budapest and joined the Christian National Union Party (KNEP). He returned to the Workers' Industrial Fund as director of the fund's branch in V\u00e1rker\u00fclet. He was known for providing free treatment to impoverished people in Kelenf\u00f6ld and L\u00e1gym\u00e1nyos.\nAlfr\u00e9d Drasche-L\u00e1z\u00e1r and \u00c1gost Ben\u00e1rd sign the Treaty of Trianon on 4 June 1920\nIn November 1919, Ben\u00e1rd joined the Ministry of Public Welfare and Labor as an administrative secretary. When S\u00e1ndor Simonyi-Semadam became Prime Minister in March 1920, he selected Ben\u00e1rd to be Minister of Public Welfare. From 1920 until 1922, he served as a representative of KNEP in the National Assembly. He was the first Minister of Public Welfare in the reunified Kingdom of Hungary following the collapse of the Austria-Hungary in 1918.\nIn June 1920, Ben\u00e1rd and Alfr\u00e9d Drasche-L\u00e1z\u00e1r were chosen by Simonyi-Semadam to travel to the Grand Trianon in Versailles to sign the Treaty of Trianon on behalf of Hungary. The treaty saw Hungary's withdrawal from WWI and the loss of 71% of its territory. Ben\u00e1rd was chosen for this position due to his role as Minister of Public Welfare, his positive public perception, and his strong Christian faith. He chose to sign it as a sign of protest against the communist revolutionaries.\nIn July 1921, President Mikl\u00f3s Horthy replaced Simonyi-Semadam with P\u00e1l Teleki as Prime Minister. Ben\u00e1rd served as Minister of Public Welfare under Teleki until April 1921, when Teleki was replaced by Istv\u00e1n Bethlen. After leaving parliament, he briefly worked as editor-in-chief of the right-wing political newspaper N\u00e9p and served as a representative of the Christian Village Party\u00a0 in the National Assembly. In 1924, feeling that the values of his party no longer aligned with his Christian socialist beliefs, he retired from politics.\nBen\u00e1rd's retirement would last eight years.

    "South Korean television screenwriter\nIn this Korean name, the family name is  Song.\nSong Jae-jeong (Korean:\u00a0\uc1a1\uc7ac\uc815; born on November 28, 1973) is a South Korean film television screenwriter. Song is best known for her dramas, Nine, W: Two Worlds Apart, Memories of the Alhambra, and Yumi's Cells.\nSong has been recognized with several prestigious awards, including the 4th KIPA Awards Writer's Award, the 20th Korea Broadcast Writer's Award (Entertainment), and the Korea Content Awards Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism's Commendation in 2013 and 2016. Additionally, she was honored with the Writer of the Year Award at the MBC Drama Awards.\nEarly life\nSong Jae-jeong was born in Daejeon on November 28, 1973. Raised in a bustling restaurant environment, she found solace in solitude and cultivated a love for comic books, mystery novels, and gaming. With aspirations of becoming a journalist, she enrolled in the Department of Journalism and Broadcasting at Ewha Womans University in 1992.\nShe majored in journalism, but she had hardly ever written anything until that point, so she never dreamed of becoming a writer. Her true aspiration was to become a journalist. However, she did not study enough, and her grades were poor that she could not even take the employment exams.\nThinking she had to work at a broadcasting station due to her major, she realized that becoming a writer was a way to get in without considering school grades or exams. So, she enrolled in the Broadcasting Academy. For an assignment, she submitted a sketch comedy. The comedy instructor praised her talent, to which she responded in disbelief, \"Me? I've never made anyone laugh before!\" Even her family doubted it, \"How could a kid who always sits alone and never talks have a knack for comedy?\" But since she was told she had a talent, she joined a production company as a broadcast writer.\nCareer\nEarly career\nSong began her career as a cultural programs writer in 1996, choosing not to pursue a career as a drama writer because of the high intellectual demands. She also believed she did not have the talent to be an entertainment writer. However, a comedy writer at a broadcasting station noticed her potential. Song was then recruited by Yoo Seong-chan, a key figure in SBS TV's entertainment department. She started her career as an entertainment writer on SBS TV comedy show Laughter High School, and went on to work on other shows such as I Love Comedy\u00a0, Game of Life, Lee Moon-se's Live\u00a0, and Game Show High Five\u00a0. While working on the sitcom Dad is the Boss\u00a0, Song found that sitcom writing was a perfect fit for her.\nIn 1997, Kim Byung-wook\u00a0 who was at the same production company, asked her to join a new SBS TV sitcom called Miss and Mister due to a shortage of staff. She attended a meeting and found it enjoyable, but the program ended abruptly before she could learn much. In 1998, there was talk within the broadcasting station about planning the sitcom Soonpoong Clinic\u00a0. Song dropped everything she was doing and joined the team. She learned writing techniques of comedy, romance, and more through sitcoms. Initially, Soonpoong Clinic had difficulty attracting attention, only securing one advertisement. However, as the show's characters and episodes evolved, its popularity surged and exploded within a year.\n\"The response to Soonpoong was truly explosive. Not only did Oh Ji-myeong\u00a0, who was already considered the 'Midas hand of sitcoms' with General Oh\u00a0, become a star, but Sunwoo Yong-yeo\u00a0, Park Young-gyu, Song Hye-kyo, and even the child actress who played Mi-dal also became stars. Thanks to that, I also became famous.\"\nSoonpoong Clinic was a pivotal moment in Song's life, as it established her reputation as the top sitcom writer. She believes that Soonpoong set the standard for Korean sitcoms, with its natural humor, unexpected twists, and heartfelt family stories. Song also cherishes her time working on Soonpoong because it brought her together with directors Kim Byung-wook, Kim Young-ki, and other writers, creating a strong sitcom team that lasted for a decade. She reflects on the challenges of creating instant laughter in a sitcom, emphasizing the importance of quick wit and comedic timing.\nThe success of Soonpoong Clinic led to further collaborations with director Kim Byung-wook. The two were evaluated as having established the prototype of Korean sitcoms by successively releasing hit sitcoms like Why Can't We Stop Them\u00a0 (2001\u20132002), Honest Living\u00a0 (2002\u20132003), and Cute or Crazy\u00a0 (2005). Together, they were recognized as a duo of sitcom geniuses in the broadcasting industry. Their next sitcom, High Kick! was highly anticipated as a standout work from the start.\nDuring the production of High Kick!, the staff had unique nicknames, with Song being referred to as \"Bright Cow\" due to her email ID being \"Merry Cow.\" The project plan was developed in May, and the writers came together in July to work on High Kick!. They conducted brainstorming sessions to generate",
    "Filmmaking industry in Guinea-Bissau\nThe cinema of Guinea-Bissau arose along with the country's independence. Since the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence, film in the country has remained an underfunded state-controlled industry. The earliest filmmaking in the country was influenced by Am\u00edlcar Cabral's views on propaganda, and consisted of documentation of the war of independence. Although the war was documented by foreign filmmakers, Cabral arranged for the education of four young Bissau-Guineans in Cuba in film technique. Early Bissau-Guinean films were produced by this group, and consisted of propaganda documentaries about the revolutionary struggle, although much of their footage was lost. \nFilmmaking in the country after independence suffered due to a lack of governmental support and funds, although the Instituto Nacional de Cinema was founded during this time. The 1980 coup d'\u00e9tat also interrupted film production in the country. Guinea-Bissau's first feature films were produced in 1987, and by 1995 had only produced a few feature films. Guinea-Bissau's films continue to rely heavily on foreign co-productions and collaborations.\nHistory\nRevolutionary beginnings\nRevolutionary Am\u00edlcar Cabral believed cinema could be used as a propaganda tool in the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence.\nGuinea-Bissau won independence from Portugal in 1974, after a 15-year conflict. Early attitudes toward film in the emerging nation emerged from the ideology of Amilcar Cabral, leader of the revolutionary African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). Cabral believed that film was a medium well-suited for propagandizing the country's independence struggle, and that Bissau-Guineans should use film to present their own images and representations of themselves. To this end, Cabral sent high schoolers Jos\u00e9 Balama Columba, Josefina Crato, Flora Gomes, and Sana na N\u2019Hada to the Cuban Film Institute in 1967, where they would learn film techniques under Santiago \u00c1lvarez and finish their schooling. Cuba was aligned with the PAIGC's goals, and \u00c1lvarez himself was a proponent of the Third Cinema movement, which emphasized a non-colonial and revolutionary perspective in film, as well as an experimental, low-budget style. This school of revolutionary filmmaking influenced the Bissau-Guineans. Upon returning from Cuba, the four filmmakers documented the ongoing war for independence, with the guidance of Senegalese filmmaker Paulin Soumanou Vieyra. The group would save up leftover film to venture into \"the bush\" to document the war. Connections with Cuban film persisted during this period, with one of the first films shot in Guinea-Bissau being Cuban filmmaker Jos\u00e9 Massip's Madina de Bo\u00e9 (1969). Most films produced in this period were by foreign filmmakers, who aimed to encourage aid to the PAIGC overseas. Early filmmaking in Guinea-Bissau concentrated on documentaries, tied to the revolutionary concept of participao popular. The filmmakers were distrusted by many PAIGC combatants, posing a challenge to the recording of footage.\nMuch of the footage shot by Bissau-Guinean filmmakers during the war was not used as internal propaganda, as the country did not have labs with which to develop film, leading to much of it being exported. According to N'Hada, much of what was filmed was sent \"to Conakry and we would never hear of its whereabouts again.\" Even the footage of the country's proclamation of independence ended up in the Soviet Union. The foundational Bissau-Guinean film is the 30-minute documentary O regresso de Am\u00edlcar Cabral (The Return of Am\u00edlcar Cabral). Co-directed by five filmmakers in 1976, including the four Cuban-trained videographers, uses live footage and still imagery to document the procession of Cabral's body from Conakry to Bissau, following the revolutionary's assassination. Another film of this period is Anos de oca luta (The Years of Struggle) (1978), credited to Gomes.\nPost-independence\nAfter the end of the war, Guinea-Bissau's government did not have the resources to sustain a film program, prioritizing instead other needs, such as healthcare. Post-independence Guinea-Bissau, under Am\u00edlcar Cabral's brother Lu\u00eds, who was encouraged by foreign filmmaker Lennart Malmer to stimulate filmmaking in the country, steered its videographers towards the production of news programs, following the models of Cuba and Mozambique. Footage was filmed for the intended program, Jornais de Atualidades, but was never broadcast, and the filmmakers were afforded little creative control on the project. Most film shot in this period was for the Jornais de Atualidades, often of state events such as visiting politicians. In either 1977 or 1978, N'Hada co-founded the Instituto Nacional de Cinema (INC) along with Angolan M\u00e1rio Pinto de Andrade.  Filmmaker Chris Marker spent time with the Bissau-Guinean group of filmmakers in 1979, using footage shot by N'Hadaa in the film Sans Soleil, while Malmer procured equipment for the IN",

    "\nAdolfo Daniel Roitman (Buenos Aires, Argentina, June 13, 1957) is an archaeologist and expert in comparative religions of Argentinian and Israeli descent. Since 1994, he has been the curator of the Dead Sea Scrolls collection and the director of the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum, where he promoted the platform that displays the scrolls online for the world.\nBiography\nThe son of Susana and Manuel Roitman, a native of San Juan from the town of General San Mart\u00edn, Roitman was born and raised in the Jewish community of the Buenos Aires neighborhood of La Paternal, and studied at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1986, he graduated as a rabbi from the Latin American Rabbinical Seminary and later emigrated to Israel, already speaking Hebrew, with his doctoral thesis based on the Book of Judith.\nWith this background, he obtained the position of curator of the Dead Sea Scrolls, dealing with leather as his grandfather had done, who was a shoemaker in the city of San Juan, where Adolfo Roitman was named an illustrious visitor in 2017. He was married, has three children, lives in Israel, and speaks and writes in Spanish, English, and Hebrew.\nIn 2019, the documentary Paternal, directed by Eduardo Yedlin, was released in Argentina. It chronicles Adolfo Roitman's journey from the Buenos Aires neighborhood to guarding the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nCareer\nIn 1980, he obtained a cum laude bachelor's degree in anthropology and a teaching degree in history from the University of Buenos Aires. He continued his master's studies, graduating in 1985 with cum laude honors in Comparative Religion from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he also earned a doctorate in Ancient Jewish Thought. He was a professor of Comparative Religion at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and of Ancient Jewish Thought at the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies. Through one of the judges on his doctoral committee, he learned of the opening and applied for the position of curator and director of the Shrine of the Book, where he has served since 1994 as the Lizbeth and George Krupp Curator of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Director of the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum.\nAs curator, Roitman took care of the physical health of the manuscripts in his charge, and also researched, published, and disseminated their content through publications, exhibitions, or educational projects, developing new strategies, such as producing the dramatic film about the Dead Sea community called The Human Sanctuary or an animated film about the scrolls for children. The Human Sanctuary is available online and, although it is not a documentary, it shows information on the screen about the place and time in which the community that kept the Dead Sea Scrolls lived. His goal was to find different languages for different types of audiences, developing training programs for high school students, or curating exhibitions, such as the one aimed at disseminating the nano Bible, the smallest Bible in the world.\nAmong all these new strategies, the digitization of the scrolls and their availability via Google since September 2011 stands out, making it possible for everyone, not just researchers, to read the scrolls. Roitman wrote the texts that accompany the scrolls on the Internet, including information about their discovery in the caves of Qumran, and photographer Ardon Bar Hama took the images, while Google's engineers developed the platform where they would be hosted, and a team from the Israel Museum worked to integrate that development into their website.\nHe has participated in international conferences and symposia, and has also been a visiting professor at academic institutions such as the University of Buenos Aires, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, New York University, the Complutense University of Madrid, El Colegio de M\u00e9xico, Anahuac University, Hebraica University in Mexico, the Presbyterian Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo, and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in Santiago de Chile. He is also the author of various articles in professional journals, as well as popular essays.\nWorks\nAmong his published books, A Day At Qumran: The Dead Sea Sect and Its Scrolls, published by The Israel Museum, Jerusalem (1998), stands out. The first book published in Spain was Sectarians of Qumran: Daily Life of the Essenes, published in 2000 by Ediciones Mart\u00ednez Roca.\nHe co-edited Envisioning the Temple: Scrolls, Stones, and Symbols (2003 Roitman, Laderman), The Bible in Shrine of the Book From the Dead Sea Scrolls to the Aleppo Codex published in 2006, and The Dead Sea Scrolls and Contemporary Culture, edited by Adolfo D. Roitman, Lawrence H. Schiffman, and Shani Tzoref and published by Brill in 2011.\nIn The Bible, Exegesis, and Religion, published by Verbo Divino, he proposed a critical historical reading of Judaism, changing the start date of monotheism to an earlier date than previously established, placing it closer to the 8th and 6th centuries BCE, according t",
    "Polish political activist (1941\u20132024)\nWujec in 2024\nLudwika Wujec (2 April 1941 \u2013 26 May 2024) was a Polish physicist, teacher, politician, and political activist. Wujec was a member of the pro-democracy dissident movement against the Polish People's Republic during the country's communist era.\nBiography\nWujec was born on 2 April 1941, to a Jewish family in Soviet-annexed Lviv, in present-day Ukraine. Her parents were tailors. Nazi Germany seized Lviv during Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, just months after her birth. Wujec spent the first years of her life living in the Soviet Union with her mother as a refugee near Stalingrad and the Ural Mountains region. Her father, Oskara, fought in the Second Polish Army, a Polish People's Army unit formed in the Soviet Union, and was killed at the Battle of Dresden in 1945.\nWujec returned to Poland with her mother in 1946 after World War II. She graduated from Juliusza S\u0142owackiego High School in Warsaw received her degree from the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at the University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. She initially joined the ruling communist Polish United Workers' Party and became a math and physics teacher during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1970, she married Henryk Wujec, a Polish physicist, politician and social activist. The couple remained together until his death in 2020.\nIn 1980, Henryk Wujec joined the Solidarity trade union. One year later, Ludwika Wujec joined Solidarity's press and media agency. Wujec was arrested and imprisoned for her affiliation with Solidarity during the period of Martial law in Poland, which lasted from 1981 to 1983.\nWujec became an assistant to Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a prominent Solidarity leader and first post-communist prime minister, during the late 1980s, including during the Polish Round Table Agreement negotiations in 1989. She then served as the deputy director of Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa's Office of the Citizen Committee.\nFollowing the fall of Communism, Wujec entered Warsaw city government. She served as the secretary and governing board member for the now-defunct Warszawa-Centrum commune\u00a0 from 1995 until 2002. In 1998, Wujec was elected to the Warsaw County, which was disestablished in 2002. She retired from elected politics in 2002.\nWujec died on 26 May 2024, at the age of 83. Her death was announced by her son, Pawe\u0142 Wujec.

    "Japanese judoka (1897\u20131977)\nKyutaro Kanda (\u795e\u7530\u4e45\u592a\u90ce, Kanda Ky\u016btar\u014d, December 20, 1897 \u2013 June 15, 1977) was a Japanese judoka.\nBiography\nKanda initiated his judo training with Minematsu Watanabe in the Kodokan dojo in Aramachi, Fukushima, later moving to the local branch of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai. After moving to Tokyo, he also started to train Yoshin-ryu jujutsu under Kinsaku Yamamoto, a former apprentice to Hikosuke Totsuka. Kanda became interested in re-joining the Kodokan at the same time, but he was barred from joining due to Yamamoto disapproving of their training methods, despite the fact that his own son Noboru Yamamoto was at the Kodokan at the time. To compensate it, Kanda instead joined the dojo of 2nd dan judoka Tami Minegawa.\nKanda went to serve five years of military service in Russia, and upon his return in 1923, with Yamamoto's death, he could finally become a Kodokan member. He was put under Kyuzo Mifune, and thanks to his talent and extensive previous training in jujutsu, he earned his 4th dan by 1926.\nKanda demonstrating kata guruma.\nKanda was a highly innovative judoka, who assisted with in the development of several techniques. Due to his tenure in jujutsu schools that allowed matches to start from the ground, he was a master of newaza, where he was an early proponent of kuzure kami shiho gatame, and favored more complex moves of his invention, including an original pin baptized as kuzure yoko shiho tai gatame (\u5d29\u6a2a\u56db\u65b9\u5e2f\u56fa) and a combination of waki gatame and chokehold named waki gatame jime (\u8107\u56fa\u7d5e).\nHowever, he was much more known by his unorthodox tachi waza, which he was forced to develop in order to keep pace with the Kodokan experts. He was initially a specialist of tomoe nage and kata guruma, but decided to focus solely on the latter due to it being a rare technique few judoka knew how to counter. He perfected it with Jigoro Kano himself and Mifune, the Kodokan's best connoisseurs of the move, and after three years he was an expert himself.\nSince his jujutsu days, Kanda was also skilled with morote gari and kuchiki taoshi, at the time both of them collectively known as \"kuchiki taoshi\", which he had learned from his master Yamamoto in order to defeat bigger and heavier opponents. Fearing senior judokas would consider them unskilled techniques, in 1926 he came up with the name \"morote gari\" for said variation and consulted with Kano whether it should be a judo move. Kano asked him to demonstrate it in sparring, and after Kanda defeated multiple judoka with it, Kano declared morote gari an official move to be taught. Kuchiki taoshi was also made it official afterwards.\nIn 1930, after some years working primarily as a trainer and earning his 6th dan, Kanda applied for the national judo championship sponsored by The Asahi Shimbun, winning the qualifier tournament and reaching the finals of the championship, where he squared against former sumo wrestler and fellow 6th dan Kinsuke Sudo. The bout, refereed by Yoshitsugu Yamashita and hosted under heavy rain at the Meiji Jingu Gaien Stadium, saw Sudo repeatedly seeking to land uchi mata, with Kanda countering by seeking okuri eri jime and other submissions by gaining his back. Kanda came back with his signature kata guruma and launched a morote gari attempt, but at the last second Sudo reversed him with tawara gaeshi that threw Kanda two meters behind him, although failing to get the ippon due to getting out of the area. At the end, Kanda lost by judge decision, but the match would come to be considered one of the greatest judo matches of the Sh\u014dwa era.\nKanda (right) against Otani (left) during their 1930 bout.\nHoping to avenge his defeat, Kanda applied for the 1931 championship, but he found out Sudo had opted out of the tournament. Kanda remained, however, and went to win the championship after beating Bunzo Nakanishi by kata gatame, Takeshi Aoki by kuzure kami shiho gatame and Sadakichi Takahashi by kata guruma.\nIn 1934, he was the oldest of the sixteen judoka chosen to participate at the Showa Tenrain-jiai event to celebrate the birth of prince Akihito. In the preliminary round, he fought a round robin match against Kanbei Furusawa, Yoshio Ochi and Kunijiro Minagawa, defeating all three of them and advancing to the final round. Here Kanda faced Masanobu Yamamoto, a former understudy of the famed Mataemon Tanabe, and defeated him by an uchi mata transitioned into a kata guruma. The very final bout pitted Kanda against the nine years younger Akira Otani, another former sumotori whose throwing mastery compared enough with Kanda's ground skills for the bout to be nicknamed \"Otani on his feet, Kanda lying down\" (\u201c\u7acb\u3063\u3066\u5927\u8c37\u3001\u5bdd\u3066\u795e\u7530\u201d). After a failed kata guruma attempt, Kanda went then for tomoe nage, which he transitioned into an attempt to drag Otani down by the legs, but referee Hajime Isogai stopped the match at that point, trouncing his advance. Kanda persistently pursued kata guruma three more times, but Otani survived and landed an ippon seoi nage",

    "Artwork on the front cover of albums by Blue Note Records\nFrom top left:\nArt Blakey - A Night at Birdland, Volume 1 (1954)\nSonny Clark - Cool Struttin' (1958)\nHank Mobley - No Room for Squares (1964)\nJoe Henderson - Mode for Joe (1966)\nThe album covers of Blue Note Records, an American jazz record label, have been recognized for their distinctive designs. Many of these covers feature a combination of bold colors, experimental typography, and candid photographs of the album's musicians, and have been described as belonging to the Bauhaus and Swiss Style movements.\nIn the early 1950s, the LP record format gained popularity, necessitating album covers with graphics and information. During this time, artists like Gil Mell\u00e9, Paul Bacon, and John Hermansader began designing covers for Blue Note, often featuring photos by label executive Francis Wolff. In 1956, Reid Miles, a former assistant to Hermansader, was hired as Blue Note's art director. Miles made approximately 400 to 500 album covers for the label, which used various typefaces, mixed letter cases, and design principles and techniques such as asymmetry and tinting. He left Blue Note in 1967 following founder Alfred Lion's retirement. After Miles's departure, Forlenza Venosa Associates and other artists, including Mati Klarwein and Bob Venosa, designed many of the label's covers. The early to mid-1970s saw the work of designers such as Norman Seeff and Bob Cato featured on Blue Note covers, while in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the label's records were reissued in Japan with new covers designed by Japanese artists. From the mid-1980s through the early 21st century, a number of artists, including Paula Scher, P. R. Brown, and Adam Pendleton, contributed to the cover designs for the label's releases.\nThe Blue Note album covers, particularly those designed by Miles, have been highly regarded and considered definitive of jazz's visual identity. Critics have praised the covers' designs as iconic and noted their ability to capture the spirit of the musicians and their music. The style of these covers has inspired several graphic designers and musicians, influencing a wide range of album art and other visual media.\nBackground\nMain article: Blue Note Records\nBlue Note Records is an American jazz record label, founded in March 1939 in New York City by German-Jewish immigrant Alfred Lion. The label initially comprised Lion and American writer Max Margulis, who provided funding and copywriting services. Blue Note's first releases were Dixieland \"hot\" and boogie-woogie-style jazz, and featured acts such as Albert Ammons, Frankie Newton, and J. C. Higginbotham. The label's first hit record was a version of George Gershwin's \"Summertime\" recorded by saxophonist Sidney Bechet.\nLion's friend, photographer Francis Wolff, joined the label in October 1939 and headed the business during Lion's military service in the early 1940s, distributing Blue Note records through the wholesale division at producer Milt Gabler's Commodore Music Shop. Following Lion's return in November 1943, the label began to embrace the increasingly popular bebop style of jazz, releasing records from musicians such as Ike Quebec and Thelonious Monk in the mid-1940s.\nHistory\n1951\u20131956: Early years\nThe cover of Wynton Kelly's Piano Interpretations (1951) features a photograph taken by Wolff, and was designed by Gil Mell\u00e9.\nAt almost every Blue Note recording session, Wolff would photograph the musicians as they played, seeking to capture honest and unrehearsed moments. Though they were taken primarily for personal reasons rather than marketing purposes, the photographs would be used infrequently in Blue Note advertising material, publicity photos, and on record sleeves. However, the growing popularity of 10-inch (25\u00a0cm) LP records in the late 1940s and early 1950s amplified the need for detailed album covers with graphics and information, and Wolff's photos would be featured on more of Blue Note's covers after the label began issuing 10-inch LPs in 1951.\nOne of the first noted appearances of Wolff's photographs on a Blue Note album cover was on Wynton Kelly's album Piano Interpretations (1951), which was designed by saxophonist Gil Mell\u00e9. The photo used on the cover portrays Kelly with his \"eyes almost closed, mouth open in an appreciative smile\", described as an \"oasis of calm\" by jazz writer Richard Cook. Graphic designers Paul Bacon and John Hermansader would also incorporate Wolff's photos in their designs, such as those for Thelonious Monk's Genius of Modern Music, Vol. 1 (1952) and Bud Powell's The Amazing Bud Powell (1952). While the album covers during this period did utilize Wolff's photography, the textual information and designs featured on the covers were prioritized over the inclusion of images.\nBacon and Hermansader would create most of Blue Note's covers throughout the early to mid-1950s, including Dizzy Gillespie's Horn of Plenty (1953), Bud Powell's The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 2 (1953)",
    "\nThe 1960 Winter Olympics torch relay was held in the leadup to the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley (now Olympic Valley), California, in the United States, from January 31 to February 18, 1960. It was the first torch relay in the Americas, although a flame had previously been lit at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. For the final time, the Olympic flame was not lit in the Greek city of Olympia. The relay instead began in Morgedal, Norway, as had been done for the first Winter Olympics torch relay in 1952.\nOrganization\nThe responsibility for organizing the torch relay, in addition to the opening and closing ceremonies, fell to the Pageantry Committee and its chairman Walt Disney. Disney brought many employees of his company WED Enterprises (now known as Walt Disney Imagineering), who had recently designed and begun operating Disneyland, to organize these events.\nThe committee intended for the flame to be lit in Olympia, Greece, which was the established tradition for Summer Olympics but had never been done before in the Winter Olympics. However, the Hellenic Olympic Committee, which is responsible for lighting the flame at Olympia and transporting it through Greece before it is handed off to the organizing committee of the current Olympics, was only informed of these plans a few days before the relay was set to begin. With no torches on hand to relay the flame through Greece, no arrangements having been made for the transportation of the flame out of Greece, and winter weather that made the traditional lighting of the flame from the rays of the sun unlikely, the HOC turned down the organizing committee's request on January 28, just four days before the flame was supposed to arrive in Los Angeles. The Games' organizers quickly turned to the Norwegian Olympic Committee, asking them to light the flame at Morgedal, the birthplace of competitive skiing, as had been done for the 1952 relay. Norwegian officials agreed, and the flame was lit at Morgedal on January 31, where it was carried to Sondre Norheim's chalet by skier Olav Nordskog. It was then transported by car through Oslo to Copenhagen, Denmark, from which it was flown to Los Angeles.\nTorch\nA torch from the relay at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nThe torch was designed by Disney artist John Hench, who modeled it after the torches used in 1948 and 1956. The International Olympic Committee credits Ralph Lavers, who created the 1948 torch, as co-designing the 1960 torch with Hench. However, Hench found these torches to be too top-heavy and difficult to carry, and produced a smaller model which has influenced the design of later Olympic torches. The torch bears the inscriptions \"VIII Olympic Winter Games 1960\" and \"Olympia to Squaw Valley\", reflecting the canceled plan to light the flame in Greece.\nRoute\nLos AngelesBurbankGormanBakersfieldTulareFresnoMercedModestoStocktonSan FranciscoSacramentoColfaxEmigrant GapBlyth Arenaclass=notpageimage| Map of the route through California.\nThe Olympic flame arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on the morning of February 1, 1960. A Scandinavian Airlines jet liner carried it over the North Pole on its way to the United States. From the airport, a helicopter carried the torch to Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1932 Summer Olympics had been held. Shot put champion Parry O'Brien was the first American to carry the torch, handing it to Los Angeles mayor Norris Poulson.\nThe first segment of the relay was run entirely on foot from Los Angeles to Stockton, with runners carrying the flame for roughly six hours per day and typically stopping in the mid-afternoon. For most of its journey across California, the torch was carried by high school athletes from all around the state. The California Interscholastic Federation organized the selection of torchbearers, with high school coaches allowed to choose one student each. Approximately 600 students participated in the relay, each one carrying the flame for one mile. Renault, a sponsor of the 1960 Winter Olympics, provided pace cars which followed the relay, picked up and dropped off runners, and supplied them with torches and fuel. The cars were driven by officers of the California Highway Patrol.\nOn the first day of the relay, the torch was carried from Los Angeles to Glendale and into the San Fernando Valley before stopping for the night in Burbank. Gymnasts from Burbank's John Burroughs High School, including a young Dan Haggerty, formed a human pyramid that lifted the torch up and used it to light a large replica torch in front of City Hall. Similar lighting ceremonies were staged in many of the towns the relay passed through, and these torches continued burning until the Olympics ended.\nOn February 2, the runners passed through San Fernando, Newhall, and Castaic (the latter two now part of Santa Clarita), then following the Ridge Route before stopping for the night in Gorman.\nEntering the San Joaquin V",
    "Defunct college in  Front Royal and Manassas, Virginia, US\nEastern College was a coeducation school that was located in Front Royal and Manassas, Virginia. It operated from 1902 to 1920. From 1920 to 1922, the former campus housed a school for girls, also called Eastern College.\nHistory\nEastern College was established in Front Royal, Virginia in 1902. The co-educational college was non-denominational and had a no-hazing policy, On December 25, 1908, the college's lecture hall was destroyed by a fire. After the fair, college officials considered relocating. Some newspapers reported that the college was moving to Myersville, Maryland. However, the college's president and dean denied the reports, stating that this was untrue.\nIt relocated to Manassas, Virginia in 1909. The college borrowed funds to construct a new campus at the south end of Battle Street, while alumni and the town funded a gymnasium. While its new campus was under construction, it occupied the Baldwin House and part of the Manssassas Improvement Corporation building. It also temporarily used the former Prince William Hotel as its women's dormitory. Construction was finished in 1910.\nIn 1912, the college had 22 faculty members. Its student enrollment was 184, with students from the local area, 22 states, and two foreign countries.\nDuring World War I, the college's buildings were renovated and leased to the government for barracks. After the war, the buildings were returned to the college. Although the school prospered, it had signification debts. The college closed in 1920 due to low enrollment and financial challenges.. It leased its buildings to a college for young women, also called Eastern College. That school closed in 1922.\nIn 1923, the former campus was sold at auction and was used by the Snavely School for Boys, a college preparatory school from 1924 to 1935. The campus was then transferred to Prince William Count which planned to use it for a vocational school, before finding it unsuitable. Abandoned, the buildings were razed in 1966 after a series of fires. The former campus is now Baldwin Park and the site of the Manassas Museum.\nCampus\nBoys Dormitory\nThe college's purpose-built Manassas campus was located on the grounds of the historic Baldwin House. Architect Charles M. Robinson designed two matching four-story brick and concrete buildings, called East Hall and West Hall, as well as a gymnasium for the college, The halls accommodated classrooms, dormitories, and offices. East Hall, the men's dormitory, was completed in June 1909. West Hall, also called Vorhees Hall, was the women's dormitory; it was completed in June 1910, followed by the gymnasium in July 1910. The dormitories included single rooms, double rooms, and suites. The bathrooms had hot and cold running water and showers.\nThe music department was housed in Baldwin House. This pre-existing structure was built in 1890 and had previously housed five other schools.\nAcademics\nEastern College awarded a Bachelor of Pedagogy and a Bachelor of Literature (Lit.B.). The college offered preparatory, college, junior college, finishing school, and business curriculums. ts courses were grouped into groups for agriculture/home economics, chemistry/biology, history/political science, modern language, music, and philosophical-pedagogical, It also provided classes in the arts, drawing, elocution, and music.\nBefore enrolling, students were required to have completed a wide range of coursework, including high school and musical courses.\nStudent activities\nEastern College had a College Christian Association, chapters of Eta Upsilon Gamma and Sigma Iota Chi sororities,\u00a0and two literary societies\u2014Washington Irving and Jeffersonian.\u00a0Campus life included student debates and music recitals.\nAthletics\nThe college's colors were red and white.\nIts male students participated in baseball and football while at the Front Royal campus, playing against Augusta Military Academy, Charleston (WV), and Washington and Lee College. At Manasses, the football team played Augusta Military, Blue Ridge (MD), George Washington  University, Gallaudet College, Georgetown University, the Manassas Football Club, Maryland Agricultural College, Mount Saint Mary's College and Seminary, Randolph\u2013Macon College, the Richmond Athletic Club, St. John's College, Shenandoah Military Academy, Virginia Military Institute, and Western Maryland. However, the football program was dropped from 1910 to 1915. After reforming, the football team was undefeated in the 1921 season.\nBaseball was Eastern College's \"signature sport\". Its team played a 25-game schedule against colleges in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C., as well as Fordham University and the University of Pennsylvania.\nThere was also a women's basketball team by 1905.\nSee also\nList of colleges and universities in Virginia\n",
    "Sufi saint\nHazrat Shah Asrar-ud-Din Baghdadi was a prominent Islamic Sufi saint in the region of Kishtwar, Jammu & Kashmir. His legacy and spiritual influence remain significant among the followers of Sufism and beyond. He was the son of Hazrat Shah Farid-ud-Din Baghdadi, a revered Sufi master, and his family lineage traces back to Baghdad, Iraq with references to their lineage being from Abdul Qadir Gilani, which is why they are referred to as \"Baghdadi.\"\nEarly life\nShah Asrar-ud-Din was born into a family known for its piety and deep spiritual roots. From a young age, he exhibited signs of extraordinary spiritual talent and inclination towards mysticism. His father, Hazrat Shah Farid-ud-Din, recognized these signs and guided him on the path of Sufism. According to legends, Shah Asrar's father prepared a special sugar syrup on the 25th day of Kartik, recited Quranic verses over it, and then gave it to Shah Asrar to drink, which led to his passing and return to God. He lived for only eighteen years but left a profound impact on his followers and the community.\nSpiritual influence\nShah Asrar-ud-Din is remembered for his miracles and spiritual guidance. His teachings emphasized the importance of Tawhid (the oneness of Allah) and the principles of Islam. He was known to have performed numerous miracles, which drew people from various backgrounds to seek his blessings and spiritual guidance. His shrine, known as Darbar-e-Asrariya or Astan-e-Payeen, located in Kishtwar, remains a major pilgrimage site. Devotees flock to his shrine, especially during his Urs (death anniversary) on the 25th of Kartik, to pay their respects and seek spiritual fulfillment.\nUrs celebration\nThe annual Urs of Hazrat Shah Asrar-ud-Din is a significant event in Kishtwar, attracting thousands of devotees. This event is marked by various religious activities, including recitations of the Quran, prayers, and communal meals. It is a time when people from different faiths come together, reflecting the inclusive nature of Sufism that Shah Asrar-ud-Din preached and practiced.\nLegacy\nHazrat Shah Asrar-ud-Din Baghdadi's legacy continues to thrive through the numerous devotees who visit his shrine named Darbar-e Asrariya and Astan-e-Payeen in Chowgan and follow his teachings. His life and works have contributed to the spread of Sufism in the region, promoting values of love, peace, and spiritual enlightenment. The shrine stands as a testament to his enduring influence and the deep respect he commands among his followers.\n",
    "Italian priest and naturalist (1746\u20131823)\nCesare Majoli born Francesco Antonio Majoli (28 February 1746 \u2013 11 January 1823) was an Italian priest, librarian, naturalist and polymath from Forli. He served as a professor of philosophy at the University of Rome, and took a keen interest in natural history and described and illustrated numerous plants and animals especially after returning to Forli. He favoured illustrations to collecting specimens and nearly 6000 watercolours made by him survive in the Forli Municipal Library in Italy.\nLife and work\nDillenia indica drawn by Majoli in the work of John Hill\nMajoli was born in Forli and entered the Order of the Hieronymites at the age of seventeen and studied theology at Rome, Ferrara (1770) and Bagnacavallo (where he studied under Antonio Lucchesi). One of the inspirations to study natural history was the lectures he attended of Giovanni Domenico Coleti between 1772 and 1773 in Romagna. He was given the name of Cesare upon being inducted at the convent of Montebello (Urbino). He taught theology at Imola and physics in Ferrara (1775) and in 1780 he taught physics in Fano. While in Ferrara he was in the circle of scholars that included Lorenzo Barotti, Gianfrancesco Malfatti, and Alessandro Zorzi. He moved to Rome in 1781 and became chair of philosophy at the university. He taught theology and philosophy and was put in charge of the library of the palace. In 1790 he returned to his hometown of Forli to the convent of San Michele and taught geometry at the Gymnasium. The invasion by the French resulted in the Jacobin Republic (1796) and the suppression of his religious order. In 1803 the local government selected him to help in the establishment of a civic library at Forli but he did not take it up due to eye problems. He had a bad cataract operation in 1814 and his vision was fixed with another surgery in 1818. He then took up the work of setting up the library which is now known as the Aurelio Saffi. He described plants and animals preferring to illustrate them rather than to collect specimens and some of his unpublished works included nearly 600 insects. He conducted some experiments on insect metamorphosis in 1813, producing intermediate forms between larvae and adults in silkworms using higher temperatures. His work on plants included 1800 illustrated plates some included in Dissertatio phytologica in collaboration with brother Angelo Gabrielli . He contributed 10 plates to the book A Decade of Curious and Elegant Trees and Plants by John Hill. He contributed plates to the work of Pietro Orlandi on livestock diseases. He collaborated with others including the Abbot Filippo Luigi Gigli and Gasparo Xuarez. He was also skilled in optics and made microscopes and he was so well known that many naturalists of the period including Andre Thouin, Gaetano Savi, and Ottaviano Tozzetti visited him. Eye problems including a cataract interrupted his researches but he also wrote on pedagogy, entomology, ichthyology and ornithology. A major work over a twenty year period was on the plants and made use of the Linnaean system of binomial names - Plantarum collectio iuxta Linnaeum sistema.\n",
    "Species of butterfly\nHypochrysops piceatus, the bulloak jewel, is a species of butterfly in the family Lycaenidae endemic to Australia. It was first described in 1969 by John Kerr, Jack Macqueen, and Don Sands. It is restricted to two present localities under 10 km2 in area in Southeastern Queensland, with another locality's population extirpated due to land clearing. As a result, it has been described as \"Australia's rarest butterfly\", with an estimated 37% chance of extinction by 2040.\nDistribution\nThere were three sites that the bulloak jewel is found in, brought down to two currently. The two extant sites are in Leyburn (Ellangowan Nature Refuge) and Bendidee State Forest. Mount Emlyn, the location of the pastoral property of one of the original discoverers, Jack Macqueen, had its population extirpated due to subsequent extensive land clearing that had occurred. The known total area of occupancy for the bulloak jewel is under 10 square kilometres (3.9\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and is severely fragmented, with the remaining area's habitat declining in quality. The Ellangowan Nature Refuge, near Leyburn, Queensland, is the primary centre of the bulloak jewel's population. It was set up as a nature refuge under the provisions of the Queensland Nature Conservation Act 1992 specifically to preserve the Leyburn site's population of bulloak jewels.\nThe bulloak jewel is restricted to the southern Darling Downs in southeastern Queensland. In particular, the Brigalow Belt South Interim Biogeographic Regionalization for Australia (IBRA) in low rainfall areas of below 600 millimetres (24\u00a0in).\nHabitat\nThe bulloak jewel inhabits old-grown bulloak woodland consisting of the larval host tree of Allocasuarina luehmannii. It also inhabits mixed bulloak woodland of Angophora leiocarpa, Eucalyptus, and Callitris. The butterfly only prefers mature growth A. luehmannii, young trees and regrowth are not inhabited altogether.\nConservation\nAndrew Stafford writing for The Guardian Australia dubbed the bulloak jewel as \"arguably Australia's rarest butterfly\", with the exception of the Australian fritillary (Argynnis hyperbius inconstans), which is believed to be extinct. Ann Jones writing for ABC Australia described it as \"one of the rarest butterflies in the world.\" Geyle et al. describes it as \"Australia\u2019s most threatened butterfly.\"\nUnder the provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), the bulloak jewel is listed as \"Critically Endangered\" as of 7 September 2023. In the state of Queensland it is listed as \"Critically Endangered\" under the provisions of Nature Conservation (Animals) Regulation 2020 as of December 2023. It is listed as \"CR\" under the provisions of Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992. It is one of 6 butterflies listed under the provisions of the EPBC Act.\nAmong the primary threats for the bulloak jewel are habitat degradation, fire, and insect collectors. It was estimated to have a 37 percentage chance of extinction by 2040. It was noted by Andrew Stafford for The Guardian Australia that \"a hot fire  would be disastrous.\" Braby et al. named habitat degradation in the forms of increased drought and fire frequency, invasive weeds, land clearing (for grazing purposes or expansion of roadways and tracks), removal of dead and fallen trees which support ant trails (for use as firewood), rubbish dumping, and selective removal of mature A. luehmannii trees (to be processed into fence posts, firewood, turnery).\nConservation of the bulloak jewel is led by the Goondiwindi Bulloak Jewel Butterfly Project, a collaboration between the Goondiwindi Botanic Gardens,  MacIntyre Ag Alliance, QMDCL Inglewood Aboriginal Rangers, and Queensland Trust For Nature, works in creating patches of habitat to create navigable spaces between known populations. Funding for the project was derived from a Queensland Government Community Sustainability Action grant.\nSands and Braby recommended the following recovery actions to be undertaken to ensure the survival of the bulloak jewel:\nField surveys to find additional populations of the bulloak jewel\nRestoration of habitat by planting more bulloaks and ensuring natural recruitment\nProtecting known breeding habitats permanently\nManaging extant sites such as removing rubbish and preventing the illegal removal of trees and firewood\nTaxonomy\nThe bulloak jewel was first brought to scientific attention when Dr. John Kerr and Jack Macqueen, a local farmer, captured specimens near Leyburn, Queensland. It was first described as Hypochrysops piceata in John F. R. Kerr, Jack Macqueen, and Don P. Sands' 1969  A new species of Hypochrysops (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) from south Queensland published in the Journal of the Australian Entomological Society. In Dunn and Dunn's 1991 Review of Australian Butterflies: distribution, life history and taxonomy, it was moved to Hypochrysops piceatus which remains the current name.

    "\nBattle of Mastara was a military battle fought by the Armenian National Council and the Ottoman Empire, it took place between May 24 and May 28 in 1918, and was one of the battles which resulted to the formation of the First Republic of Armenia.\nBattle\nThe battle began on the 24th of May 1918, when Ottoman troops approached the Armenian garrison of only 3,000 men commanded by Drastamat Kanayan in Mastara, the Ottoman army had much more weapons and soldiers, however they were not as moralized as the Armenians were.\nThe Ottomans had begun their assault, and by May 25 heavy fighting was occurring in Mastara, the Ottomans were however unable to properly break the defensive line of the Armenians, whom used the Church of Saint John to command the defensive line. After two failed Ottoman attacks from May 24\u201325, they decided to assault the Church of Saint John directly, due to its importance for the Armenian troops both culturally and for the sake of the battle's command, the Ottoman attack began on the night of May 26, with Ottoman troops seeing initial successes, breaking through the Armenian defensive line for the first time and rapidly advancing towards the church. The Armenians however did not easily give up on, as they fought bravely, using grenades and hit and run tactics against the Ottomans in the fairly fortified city, suffering hundreds of casualties in the process but being successful in the defense, as Ottoman troops were forced to retreat outside of the city, back to their original positions. Following this failed attack by the Ottomans, their morale continued to deplete, with Ottoman troops regularly deserting during the battle which forced the Ottomans to retreat after more breakthrough attempts between May 27\u201328 had horribly failed.\nReference\n^ Walker, Christopher J.

    "1952 song\nHey Miss Fannie was a 1952 single for the R&B group the Clovers. It became a hit for them that year. It has been covered by several other artists over the years.\nHistory\n\"Hey Miss Fanny\" was written by Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn.\nIn addition to the version by The Clovers, a demo was recorded by The Teen Kings, a group that included Roy Orbison in their line up. They were looking for a contract and went to studio to audition for the Columbia label. Two tracks were recorded at the session, one was \"Hey, Miss Fannie\" and the other was \"Ooby Dooby\".\nTommy Sands recorded a version which appeared on his 1959 Sands Storm! album which was released on Capitol T1081.\nDean Webb also recorded a version that was released in 1959.  It was the B side of his solo debut, \"Warm Your Heart\", which was released on Parlophone 45- R4549. In spite of the R&B genre that this song originated from, Webb managed to get his voice and the musical content to come together to produce the right result. According to the Record Collector magazine in 2013, his version was \"a near-perfect example of British rock\u2019n\u2019roll at the tail end of the era\".\nClovers version\nBackground\n\"Hey, Miss Fannie\" backed with \"I Played the Fool\" was issued on Atlantic 45\u2013977 in October, 1952. It would be an R&B Top Ten hit.\nThere was a mention of the song in The Cash Box Rhythm & Blues Ramblings column of October 11. It said. \" If past history is any indication, you\u2019ll soon be hearing \u201cHey Miss Fannie\u201d and \u201cI Played The Fool\u201d, over and over again.\" Along with \"If Be Satisfied\" by Billy Ward and His Dominos, \"Hey Miss Fannie\" was The Cash Box Award O' the Week record. The review of the record said that it was a fast beat rocker and a two-sided release that was a natural follow up to their \u201cTing-A-Ling\u201d single.\nChart\nThe October 18 issue of The Cash Box reported that the single was at no. 6 on the Hot chart in Dallas.\nThe October 25 issue of The Cash Box reported that it was at no. 7 on the Hot chart in Atlanta. The Following week (1 November) it was at no. 6 in Atlanta and No. 10 in Memphis. On 8 November, it was at no. 9 in both Philadelphia and Memphis. The following week, it was at no. 4 in Fort Worth and no. 7 in Memphis. It was also at no. 10 in Los Angeles and no. 5 in St. Louis and no. 9 in Shoals Ind.\nThe song would eventually be recorded by Cash Box as a no. 1 in Philadelphia.  It would chart nationally on the Billboard R&B chart, peaking at no. 2. The B side, \"I Played the Fool\" would also made the charts, peaking at no. 3.\n",

    "Ukrainian writer and communist revolutionary (1901\u20131919)\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is  Hryhorovych and the family name is  Chumak.\nVasyl Hryhorovych Chumak (Ukrainian: \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0301\u043b\u044c \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0427\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0301\u043a; 7 January 1901\u00a0 \u2013 21 November 1919) was a Ukrainian writer and communist revolutionary.\nBiography\nVasyl Hryhorovych Chumak was born on 7 January 1901 in the town of Ichnia, Chernigov Governorate. His father was the Cossack-descended Hryhorii Semenovych Chumak, while his mother was Anastasiia Petrivna Chumak (n\u00e9e Marchenko), of landlord stock. The family held six desiatiny of land in the region, including a bakery and a bread factory.\nChumak undertook his early education at a religious school, before studying at Ichnia's high school between 1910 and 1914. He next studied in Horodnia, where he finished gymnasium in 1918. After graduating he travelled to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, where he joined the Borotbists. As a Borotbist, Chumak was secretary of the party's journal, Artwork, and he also worked in the All-Ukrainian Literary Collegium of the Ministry of Education of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nFollowing the takeover of Kyiv by the White Army Chumak began organising a pro-communist resistance organisation, alongside Hnat Mykhailychenko\u00a0. The two were soon arrested, and, while attempting to escape from captivity, were both shot to death. Following the Soviet capture of Kyiv, both of their bodies were reburied in a mass grave on Anosov Square (now the Park of Eternal Glory).\nWorks\nChumak's works, first created in 1917 and encouraged by his interest in the writings of Taras Shevchenko, took on a romanticist and revolutionary character, and he wrote in several forms, including prose, stories, essays, literary criticism, and published articles. In his poetry, Chumak was an impressionist, and through his works expressed support for Ukrainian independence and communism. Following Chumak's death, a poetry collection was released under the title Prelude (Ukrainian: \u0417\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0456\u0432, romanized:\u00a0Zaspiv). Chumak was responsible for the establishment of several journals, as well as the Ichnia branch of the Prosvita society.\nLegacy\nUkrainian literary critic Volodymyr Koriak\u00a0 wrote in the 1920s that Chumak, alongside Mykhailychenko, Vasyl Ellan-Blakytny, and Andrii Zalyvchyi\u00a0, comprised a group he described as \"the first braves\", responsible for the development of Ukrainian communist literature. Chumak's works were banned from the early 1930s as part of a broader crackdown by the government of the Soviet Union on the Borotbists. In the 1950s he was rehabilitated, and his works were again permitted.\nNotes\n^ Chumak also wrote under multiple literary psuedonyms, including S. Viche (\u0421. \u0412\u0456\u0447\u0435), M. Ichnia (\u041c. \u0406\u0447\u043d\u044f), and Chornenko (\u0427\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e).\n",
    "Chinese bootleg video game developer\nMakon Soft (also known as Yong Yong) was a Chinese company that originally produced bootleg video games for the Game Boy/Game Boy Color. They also made several Android games in the late 2000s/early 2010s. Their Game Boy productions are known for being of a notably poor quality, even when compared to other bootleg video games. Yong Yong closed down in 2011.\nHistory\nGame Boy/GBC\nIt is unknown exactly where or when Makon Soft was founded, but the year they were founded is 1997. They were infamous for making unauthorized ports of popular 16/32-bit games to the Game Boy/GBC. An example is Sonic 3D Blast 5, a port of Sonic 3D Blast for the Sega Saturn, and Super Mario Special 3, a port of Super Mario Bros. 3 for the NES.\nMakon Soft later released several ROM hacks of their earlier games, such as Pok\u00e9mon Diamond, a hack of Super Mario Special 3 replacing Mario with Pikachu and the coins with Pok\u00e9 Balls. They also created colorized hacks, such as Super Donkey Kong 5, a hack of Super Donkey Kong 3, a bootleg port of the SNES game which replaced the menu art with that from Diddy Kong Racing. Their colorized games originally consisted of a very limited color palette, but this was improved later on.\nInterestingly, their Game Boy games contained strong encryption techniques, which made dumping the ROMs difficult.\nAndroid\nMakon also developed several games for Android. An example is Rolling Ball (a puzzle game where you roll differently colored balls into holes of their respective colors while avoiding enemies, inspired by Rockball by Sachen.)\nNotoriety\nBecause their ports were riddled with issues, Makon Soft gained a degree of notoriety. Examples of these issues are platforming glitches, poor controls, and poorly composed music. For example, a glitch in Super Mario Special 3 renders level 4 unbeatable. The glitch involves the ending item not appearing. Many of their other games have similar problems. Their engine seems to be based on that of Sonic 3D Blast 5, which lacks velocity and causes the player to slow down when jumping.\nGames\nGame Boy\nAndroid\nSee also\nSachen\n",

    "History of Morocco from 1666 to 1912\nThis article is about the pre-colonial history of Morocco under Alawi rule. For the sect of Shia Islam, see Alawites. For the current Moroccan royal family, see Alawi dynasty.\nThe Alawi Sultanate, officially known as the Sharifian Sultanate (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641\u0629) and as the Sultanate of Morocco, was the state ruled by the 'Alawi dynasty over what is now Morocco, from their rise to power in the 1660s to the 1912 Treaty of Fes that marked the start of the French protectorate.\nThe dynasty, which remains the ruling monarchy of Morocco today, originated from the Tafilalt region and rose to power following the collapse of the Saadi Sultanate in the 17th century. Sultan al-Rashid (r.\u20091666\u20131672) was the first to establish his authority over the entire country. The sultanate reached an apogee of political power during the reign of his successor, Moulay Isma'il (r.\u20091672\u20131727), who exercised strong central rule.\nAfter Isma'il's death, Morocco underwent periods of turmoil and renewal under different sultans. A long period of stability returned under Sidi Mohammed ibn Abdallah (r.\u20091757\u20131790). Regional stability was disrupted by the French invasion of Algeria in 1830 and thereafter Morocco faced serious challenges from European encroachment in the region.\nMorocco remained independent under 'Alawi rule until 1912, when it was placed under the control of a French protectorate. The 'Alawi sultans continued to act as nominal monarchs under French colonial rule until Morocco regained independence in 1956, with the Alawi sultan Mohammed V as its sovereign. In 1957, Mohammed V formally adopted the title of \"King\" and Morocco is now officially known as the Kingdom of Morocco.\nName and etymology\nMorocco, since the rule of the Saadi dynasty, was sometimes referred to as the Sharifian Sultanate as a reference to the ruling dynasty's claim to noble ancestry. This was rendered in French as l'Empire ch\u00e9rifien (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641\u0629; lit.\u2009'the Sharifian empire') according to the Treaty of Fes. This name was still in official usage until 1956 when Morocco regained its independence from colonial rule. It was also referred to as Sultanate of Morocco in English, including in the Anglo-Moroccan Treaty of 1856.\nThe Alawi dynasty claims descent from Muhammad via Hasan, the son of Ali. The name 'Alawi (Arabic: \u0639\u0644\u0648\u064a) stems either from the name of Ali, from which the dynasty ultimately traces its descent, or from the name of the dynasty's early founder Ali al-Sharif of the Tafilalt.\nHistory\nOrigins\nIllustration by Walter Burton Harris of the oasis of Tafilalt, where the Alawi dynasty originated from, 1895\nThe ruling dynasty of the Sultanate, the Alawis (lit.\u2009'descendants of Ali'; sometimes rendered Filali Sharifs), rose from the settlement of Sijilmassa in the eastern oasis of Tafilalt. Little is known of their history prior to the 17th century, but by this century they had become the main leaders of the Tafilalt.\nThe Alawis are believed to have been descendants of immigrants from Yanbu in the Hejaz who settled in North Africa during a drought that affected the region in the 13th century. The dynasty claims descent to the Prophet Muhammad through his grandson Hasan, the son of Ali and Muhammad's daughter Fatima.\nTheir status as shurafa (descendants of the Prophet) was part of the reason for their success, as in this era many communities in Morocco increasingly saw sharifian status and noble lineage as the best claim to political legitimacy. The Saadian dynasty, which ruled Morocco during the 16th century and preceded the 'Alawis, also claimed sharifian lineage and played an important role in engraining this model of political-religious legitimacy in Moroccan society.:\u200a228\u200a\nThe patriarch of the dynasty is believed to be Moulay Hassan ben al-Qasim ad-Dakhil, who established a religious aristocracy with his sharifian lineage throughout the oasis. Known for his deep piety, he was believed to have moved to Sijilmassa in 1265 under the rule of the Marinids at the request of locals who promoted him as imam of Tafilalt and viewed the presence of sharifs in the region as beneficial for religious legitimity.\nHe left behind a son, Mohamed, who in turn had only one descendant who bore the same name as his grandfather. One of this descendant's sons, Moulay Ali Cherif\u00a0, undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca and participated in the Moroccan\u2013Portuguese wars of the 16th century and was also invited by the Nasrids to fight against Castile in the Iberian Peninsula during the Granada War. He declined to settle in Granada at the request of scholars in the city but rather settled for many years in Fez and Sefrou before returning to Tafilalt.\nRise to power\nThe family's rise to power took place in the context of early-to-mid-17th century Morocco, when the power of the Saadian sultans of Marrakesh was in serious decline and multiple regional factions fought for control of the country. Among the most powerful of these factions were t",

    "\nIndian 2 and Indian 3 are upcoming Indian Tamil-language vigilante action films directed by S. Shankar, who co-wrote them with B. Jeyamohan, Kabilan Vairamuthu and Lakshmi Saravana Kumar. They are jointly produced by Lyca Productions and Red Giant Movies. The sequels to Indian (1996), they serve respectively as the second and third instalment of the Indian trilogy. Kamal Haasan reprises his role from the first film as Senapathy, an ageing freedom fighter turned vigilante who fights against corruption, with Siddharth, S. J. Suryah, Kajal Aggarwal,  Rakul Preet Singh, Bobby Simha, Vivek, Priya Bhavani Shankar, Gulshan Grover, Samuthirakani and Nedumudi Venu joining the ensemble cast.\nIndian 2 was announced in September 2017. Sri Venkateswara Creations was initially on board, but opted out a month later. Lyca entered the production thereafter. Principal photography commenced in January 2019, and occurred sporadically over five years, before wrapping by March 2024. Both parts were shot back-to-back, with filming locations include Chennai, Rajahmundry, Bhopal, Gwalior, Tirupati, Vijayawada, Johannesburg and Taiwan. In 2020, an accident that killed some crew members and the COVID-19 pandemic delayed filming for two years until Red Giant Movies entered as co-producers. The technical crew includes musician Anirudh Ravichander, cinematographers Ravi Varman and R. Rathnavelu, editor A. Sreekar Prasad, production designer T. Muthuraj and visual effects supervisor V. Srinivas Mohan.\nDevelopment\nDuring the production of Indian (1996), it's lead actor Kamal Haasan asked the director S. Shankar to make a sequel, but Shankar did not have a concrete story idea then. In September 2011, Shankar said many people asked him to make a sequel following Anna Hazare's anti-corruption crusade, and A. M. Rathnam, producer of the 1996 film, urged him to do so. In May 2015, Ratnam confirmed that he and Shankar discussed making a sequel but doubted the project's viability as the director was busy with the production of 2.0 (2018). Despite delaying starting the sequel due to 2.0, Shankar continued working on a story theme for it, under the tentative title Indian 2. On 30 September 2017, Haasan, the host of the first season of the Tamil reality television show Bigg Boss in Chennai, publicity announced the project during the season finale. Haasan was confirmed as the lead actor, reprising his role, and prominent Telugu film producer Dil Raju's Sri Venkateswara Creations was announced to fund the venture, thus marking his debut in Tamil.\nIn October 2017, Raju backed out, reportedly due to increased production costs. Shortly thereafter, Allirajah Subaskaran, header of Lyca Productions, took over as the film's producer. The project marks the reunion of Shankar with Haasan after a hiatus of 24 years. The director chose Anirudh Ravichander to score the music, marking their first collaboration, rather than his regular collaborator A. R. Rahman, who also scored music for its predecessor. Anirudh's inclusion was confirmed in late December 2018. cinematographer Ravi Varman, editor A. Sreekar Prasad and production designer T. Muthuraj were hired to be a part of the film's technical crew. Shankar collaborated with Jeyamohan, Kabilan Vairamuthu and Lakshmi Saravanakumar to co-write the film's script and dialogues.\nDespite several proposed announcements of starting dates, the film's shoot was delayed throughout 2018 owing to Shankar's commitments with 2.0, which also faced significant production delays. Haasan also decided to use the time to release his long-delayed Vishwaroopam II (2018) and commit to his political career. In August 2018, Shankar and Haasan, announced that the film's shoot will commence that December, The production house later publicly announced the project on 7 November, coinciding with Haasan's birthday, confirming its inclusion as the producers. Muthuraj began working on the production design the same month, as the film's shoot was scheduled to start in late that year; however the delay in its set work, made the team to postpone its shoot to early 2019. Haasan would receive around \u20b91.5 billion (US$18\u00a0million) as renumeration for the film, the highest in his career.\nCasting\nIn December 2018, Kajal Aggarwal was announced as the lead actress. For her role, Aggarwal learnt the basics of the Indian martial arts form Kalaripayattu. Siddharth was confirmed to play another role in the film, after the team had initially held discussions with the likes of Silambarasan, Dulquer Salmaan and Arya for the same character. Ajay Devgn agreed to play the antagonist in the film, but production delays meant that he could not commit dates for the films. Akshay Kumar, Abhishek Bachchan and John Abraham were considered as replacements, but neither actor was signed. Other actors including Delhi Ganesh and RJ Balaji were also signed to portray supporting roles in the film. However, Balaji opted out of the film in October 2019. Nedumudi Venu was also set t",
    "Theory of similarity of the Hungarian and Japanese languages\nJapanese\u2013Hungarian linguistic connection is a theory which holds the linguistic similarity between the Japanese and Hungarian languages. The theory has little support in modern historical linguistics. The theory is based on similarities in Vocabulary and Grammar \u2014 both being agglutinative languages, lacking Grammatical gender, usually following the same word order, using vowel harmony, using the Eastern name order, being honorifically similar, able to form future tense by only using present.\n19th Century\nIn 1823 Heinrich Julius Klaproth published his work Asia Polyglotta, in which Japanese is classified as Finno-Ugric, on the bases that many basic words are similar, hi 'fire' \u2013 Permic bi, Thai fei, Javanese api;  choshi \u2013 Khanty chos, chus, kos).\nIn 1857 Anton Boller proposed that Japanese descended from the Ural-Altaic language group.\nAs well as G\u00e1bor Szentkatolnai B\u00e1lint who in 1897 argued that the Hungarian and Japanese language groups must be connected because many of the languages' suffixes are identical. According to him there are also about 800 Hungarian base words of Japanese origin, such as Hungarian b\u00e1ba ('old woman') from Japanese \u3070\u3070/baba 'grandmother', from \u3061\u3061 ('breast' pronounced as chichi) to csecs ('breast' pronounced as chech), from \u304a\u3063\u304b\u3055\u3093/okkasan 'mother' to old-Hungarian ochin (now asszony 'married woman'), tsunagi/\u7e4b 'attach, fasten' from to zsineg 'twine'.\n20th Century\nHeinrich Winkler in 1909, in his writing Der uralaltaische Sprachstamm, das Finnische und das Japanische also wrote about the Finno-Ugric origins of Japanese.\nAccording to Winkler the ancient Finno-Ugric language is structurally connected to the Altaic and Japanese languages. Syntactically the Hungarian language has more similiarities to Japanese: for example the possessive next to personal pronouns is often preserved in Hungarian (\u00e9nnekem, \u00e9nn\u00e1lam stb.) (Japanese: no).\nThe study also includes a Japanese-Finnish-Hungarian comparative glossary, made  using the comparative method. Some examples are:\nHungarian orientalist Vilmos Pr\u00f6hle in 1917 and 1943 was on the same opinion. He considered the Japanese languages a part of or at least closely related to the Finno-Ugric language family.\nIzui Hisanosuke in his book among others connected Japanese yuki 'snow', Finnish and Estonian j\u00e4\u00e4 'ice' and Hungarian j\u00e9g 'ice' (Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian pronounce 'j' as /j/, similarly to the romaji 'y').\nLajos Kaz\u00e1r believed that both languages were of Uralic origin and in 1996 he published a linguistic comparaison of ancient Japanese and ancient Hungarian. Compared words include: amo 'mother' \u2013 eme- from which emse 'sow' evolved from; itosi 'beloved, kind' \u2013 ancient Hungarian ides, from which \u00e9des 'sweet' evolved from, cubo 'cooking vessel, pitcher' \u2013 csupor 'small cooking vessel, pint', among others.\nOther notable examples\nSee also\nAlternative theories of Hungarian language origins\nHungarian-Japanese relations\nOrigins of the Japanese language\nUral-Altaic language family\n",
    "American politician\nSusan Baker Weddington (April 6, 1951 to September 1, 2020) was a Businesswoman who from 1997 to 2003 served as party chair of Texas Republican Party during the administrations of Governors George W. Bush and Rick Perry She was the first female chair of either major party in Texas.\nBackground\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan, Weddington moved to San Antonio before she was eighteen months of age. She is one of two children of the late Louis C. Baker and the former Elaine Baird. She has a brother, David Baker.\nWeddington graduated in 1969 from Alamo Heights High School in San Antonio. and after that from Trinity University in San Antonio, from which she received a bachelor's degree in communications and was for a time an instructor of photojournalism.\nPolitical life\nThe firm Kinetic Concepts formerly employed Weddington. A Christian conservative activist, Weddington became interested in politics as the mother of a teenaged son visiting the Texas State Capitol in Austin. Her particular interests at the time were education and product liability laws.\nIn 1990, Weddington placed a black wreath that read \"Death to the Family\" at the door of the campaign headquarters in Austin for the Democratic gubernatorial nominee,  Ann Richards, the state treasurer. At the state Republican convention that year, she participated in a prayer rally and called upon the Almighty to \"watch over the caucus rooms and the convention hall.\"\nIn 1997, Weddington was unanimously elected state chairwoman by the Republican state executive committee to succeed conservative Tom Pauken of Dallas, who resigned after three years in the position to run for state attorney general. She was Pauken's choice as his successor. For part of her tenure, the vice chairman was the conservative author and activist David Barton. Weddington held support from both the religious conservative wing of her party and the fiscal conservatives. Chuck Anderson, then the executive director of the Christian Coalition, described Weddington as \"very, very well respected by members of the party from all ideological stripes.\" In 2000, Republicans held 1,600 of the approximately 4,000 elected offices in Texas but all statewide offices. Weddington said that she was determined to bring the party to long-term majority status, with particular emphasis on the state legislature.\nIn 2002, Weddington broke with tradition as state chair when she became involved in a heated Republican primary for the District 25 state Senate seat in San Antonio in which Republican Jeff Wentworth ran successfully for re-nomination. One of her predecessors as chairman, Fred Meyer of Dallas, had pointedly refused to become involved in such primary races but stood with the general election nominees regardless of policy positions.\nWhen she stepped down as state chairwoman in 2003, her party had gained a firm footing in major political offices in Texas. Weddington for six years then headed the OneStar Foundation, a non-profit organization formed by Governor Rick Perry to connect such organizations with resources and expertise to accomplish their missions and to promote volunteerism. She was succeeded as chairman by another woman, Tina Benkiser, a lawyer from Houston.\nPersonal life\nWeddington retired in 2009, and Perry named Elizabeth Seale her successor at the OneStar Foundation. In the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary, Weddington came out of retirement to endorse Rick Perry, who defeated two female challengers, including U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.\nWeddington retired to Gillespie County near Fredericksburg in the Texas Hill Country with her second husband, George Robert \"Bob\" Weddington, whom she married in San Antonio on April 1, 1983.\n",

In turn, John of Apamea's works have influenced Isaac the Syrian, a prolific 7th-century Syriac Christian mystical writer.\nName\nIn Syriac, John the Solitary is known as Yo\u1e25annan I\u1e25idaya (\u071d\u0718\u071a\u0722\u0722 \u071d\u071a\u071d\u0715\u071d\u0710).

The Greek equivalent is \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2 (monach\u00f3s).\nHistoric identity\nThe identity of the historic John of Apamea is controversial.

Ashkelony (2012) states that John of Apamea is the earliest known Christian writer to systematically write about a theory of silent prayer. In the Dialogue on the Soul, John of Apamea proposes that the three stages (or levels) of silent prayer are those of the body, soul, and finally, the spirit. As such, there are three levels of stillness. The first is the cessation of speech; the second is the stillness of the soul in which the mind no longer has to fight distracting thoughts; and last of all, the stillness of the spirit in which stillness passes beyond the soul or ego.\nWritings\nBelow is a comprehensive bibliography of writings by John of Apamea, from Sebastian Brock (1995).\nCommentary on Qohelet (Ecclesiastes)\nKephalaia\nLetters\nLetter to Hesychius\nOn Prayer\nQuestions\nDialogue on the Soul\nDialogues with Thaumasios\nTractates\nBL Add. 17170\nBL Add. 17170 (i.e., British Library Additional Manuscript 17170) is an Estrangela Syriac manuscript dated to 774-5 A.D. with 88 vellum leaves that contains various writings of John of Apamea.

    "British pressure group\nThe Muslim Vote is a British pressure group established in December 2023 which seeks to support candidates who oppose the Conservative and Labour leadership stances on the Israel\u2013Hamas war among other policy positions. \nBackground\nA survey of Muslim voters reported that 86% voted Labour in the 2019 United Kingdom general election. After Labour initially supported Israeli military action in the Israel\u2013Hamas war following the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, support for the party fell among Muslims, with a poll by Survation finding only 43% saying they would vote Labour in the next election. BBC analysis of the 2024 United Kingdom local election results said that Labour voteshare had fallen 21 percentage points in council wards where more than 20% of residents are Muslim and analysis by Number Cruncher Politics found that Labour lost 33 percentage points in majority-Muslim areas.\nHistory\nThe Muslim Vote was launched in December 2023. It is \"modelled along the lines of Operation Black Vote\". Its national co-ordinator, Abubakr Nanabawa, was previously a Labour activist as a student at the University of Birmingham. The former leader of Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain, Jalaluddin Patel, said he helped The Muslim Vote, and Anas Altikriti said he advised it.\nIn May 2024 it released a list of eighteen demands for the Labour leader Keir Starmer, including apologising for his previous stance on the Israel-Hamas war.\nThe organisation's May 2024 launch in Wales was supported by local branches of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and the Stop the War Coalition.\nIn May and June 2024 it endorsed candidates in the 2024 United Kingdom general election. It says it chose candidates who oppose the UK government's approach to the Israel-Hamas war alongside a list of other priorities including support for public services and that \"schoolteachers take cultural and religious sensitivies into account, not least when discussing LGBT issues in schools where most of the community have a religious background\". The Muslim Vote said that voters should spoil their ballots if they do not have a \"pro-Palestine, pro-peace\" candidate.\nThe organisation was criticised by some Muslims for supporting four Labour MPs who voted for a motion that called for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nReception\nThe Muslim Vote has been supported by a number of Muslim organisations including:\nMuslim Association of Britain\nMuslim Council of Scotland\nMuslim Council of Wales\nMuslim Engagement and Development\nSome organisations supporting the group were named by Michael Gove as being assessed against a new definition of extremism. The Conservative politicians Andrew Percy and Iain Duncan Smith called the organisation a threat to democracy and the Labour politician Tan Dhesi said they were trying to \"import toxic politics of persuading people to vote based on religion\". The Jewish Chronicle called The Muslim Vote a \"radical Islamist group\".\n",

    "Lithuanian businessman\nPranas Hiksa (23 May 1897 \u2013 4 April 1966) was a Lithuanian businessman, car racer, and captain of the Lithuanian Army who was the first Lithuanian military pilot. Due to his successful racing and business career, Hiksa was a known millionaire in interwar Lithuania.\nBiography\nEarly life\nPranas Hiksa was born on 23 May 1897 in the Verkiai Palace in the Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire. In 1900 his family moved to another manor at Norvai\u0161iai near \u0160iauliai, where he was educated at the \u0160iauliai Julius Janonis Gymnasium. Later he attended the Liep\u0101ja commercial school. In 1905, Hiksa's mother died, soon followed by his father. Hiksa was subsequently raised by his adopted sister's Ona Zubovien\u0117's family. \nWorld War I\nDuring World War I, he lived with his adoptive family in their residence in Moscow, where he attended the Tsarevich Alexei Commercial School and also finished drivers' courses in 1915. On 1 October 1916, he began his military service in the Russian Imperial Army's 23rd Army Corps Aviation Detachment stationed near Riga. On December 3, he was sent to the Gatchina Military Flying School. On 17 February 1917, he was made praporschik, and on 15 September he and a few others were sent to continue studying aviation at the Royal Flying Corps in England, from which he graduated on 7 September with the rank of aviation lieutenant. After the October Revolution in Russia, Hiksa moved back to Lithuania.\nLithuanian army\nPranas Hiksa (center) and other student pilots in 1921\nOn 15 May 1919, he was mobilized into the Lithuanian Army and assigned to its aviation unit, subsequently becoming the army's first pilot. On 6 June 1919, he became an officer. Hiksa participated in the Lithuanian Wars of Independence near Panev\u0117\u017eys, Zarasai, Utena and Suvalkai as a reconnaissance pilot. Hiksa is known to have been shot down a few times while on duty. He lectured in the Lituanian War Aviation School (Karo aviacijos mokykla). On 22 November 1919, he was made senior lieutenant. On 27 November he was appointed as the head of the aviation training squad, and on 16 April 1920 became air squadron chief. Notable students of Hiksa included Jurgis Dobkevi\u010dius, Antanas Gustaitis, and Jonas Mik\u0117nas. On 3 June 1922, he was promoted to captain, and three months later on 25 September was discharged from the army to study.\nBusiness and racing career\nAfter briefly studying mechanics at Vytautas Magnus University, Hiksa became a commissioner of the \u016akio bankas bank to the construction of the factory Maistas, later famously becoming its production director. From 1924 to 1928 Hiksa worked as the factory's export-import broker in Czechoslovakia and other European countries. From 1926 he was a member of the Automobile Club of Lithuania. He studied in Prague and in 1928 received an engineering diploma, after which he established his own company P. Hiksa. Praha 2, P\u0159\u00ed\u010dn\u00e1 9, which represented the Maistas factory in Czechoslovakia, the Weimar Republic, and Austria. After returning to Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania, he worked in a metal factory as chief engineer. From 1928 to 1940 he was vice-president of the Aeroclub of Lithuania. Hiksa's business endeavors abroad won various equipment contracts for the Lithuanian army, postal as well as railroad services.\nHiksa won President Antanas Smetona's trophy prize in the first organized Lithuanian car races \"Around Lithuania\" (Aplink Lietuv\u0105) in 1931 and 1932. In Kaunas, Hiksa built a pavilion that sold American automobiles. In 1933 and 1935 he participated in the Monte Carlo Rally.\nWorld War II\nHe was briefly mobilized to the war aviation unit in 1939 from 18 September to 9 October. After Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in 1940, Hiksa was briefly mobilized into the Soviet Red Army. During Soviet occupation, Hiksa worked small jobs such as engineer or mechanic in various farms, but nonetheless was watched and persecuted by Soviet authorities for his background. During Nazi occupation, Hiksa was eventually allowed to fly again as a wartime pilot near Daugavpils.\nDeath\nHiksa died on 4 April 1966 in Kaunas, and was buried in the Petra\u0161i\u016bnai Cemetery.\nPersonal life\nA polyglot (speaking the German, Russian, Polish, and Czech languages), Hiksa was married to Irena Salominait\u0117 (1909\u20131996), who was a translator in Kaunas and a teacher of Russian and German. They had daughters Ina Taletien\u0117 (born 1934), Danut\u0117 Vaitiek\u016bnien\u0117 (born 1937), Rita \u0160niukien\u0117 (born 1944), and J\u016brat\u0117 Veiverien\u0117 (born 1946).\nRemembrance\nA book about Hiksa entitled Gyvenimas kaip skrydis was released in 1996 and re-published in 2014. In 1999 designer Gediminas Karpavi\u010dius designed an envelope portrait of Hiksa. In 2000 a memorial plaque was uncovered at the Lithuanian War Aviation Memorial. In 2012, a memorial plaque was uncovered on his former house.\nExternal links\nHiksa's memoirs in the Sparnai magazine \n",
    "\nOnce a cyberattack has been initiated, there are certain targets that need to be attacked to cripple the opponent. Certain infrastructures as targets have been highlighted as critical infrastructures in times of conflict that can severely cripple a nation. Control systems, energy resources, finance, telecommunications, transportation, and water facilities are seen as critical infrastructure targets during conflict. A new report on the industrial cybersecurity problems, produced by the British Columbia Institute of Technology, and the PA Consulting Group, using data from as far back as 1981, reportedly has found a 10-fold increase in the number of successful cyber attacks on infrastructure Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems since 2000. Cyberattacks that have an adverse physical effect are known as cyber-physical attacks.\nControl systems\nControl systems are responsible for activating and monitoring industrial or mechanical controls. Many devices are integrated with computer platforms to control valves and gates to certain physical infrastructures. Control systems are usually designed as remote telemetry devices that link to other physical devices through internet access or modems. Little security can be offered when dealing with these devices, enabling many hackers or cyberterrorists to seek out systematic vulnerabilities. Paul Blomgren, manager of sales engineering at cybersecurity firm explained how his people drove to a remote substation, saw a wireless network antenna and immediately plugged in their wireless LAN cards. They took out their laptops and connected to the system because it wasn't using passwords. \"Within 10 minutes, they had mapped every piece of equipment in the facility,\" Blomgren said. \"Within 15 minutes, they mapped every piece of equipment in the operational control network. Within 20 minutes, they were talking to the business network and had pulled off several business reports. They never even left the vehicle.\"\nEnergy\nEnergy is seen as the second infrastructure that could be attacked. It is broken down into two categories, electricity and natural gas. Electricity also known as electric grids power cities, regions, and households; it powers machines and other mechanisms used in day-to-day life. Using US as an example, in a conflict cyber terrorists can access data through the Daily Report of System Status that shows power flows throughout the system and can pinpoint the busiest sections of the grid. By shutting those grids down, they can cause mass hysteria, backlog, and confusion; also being able to locate critical areas of operation to further attacks in a more direct method. Cyberterrorists can access instructions on how to connect to the Bonneville Power Administration which helps direct them on how to not fault the system in the process. This is a major advantage that can be utilized when cyberattacks are being made because foreign attackers with no prior knowledge of the system can attack with the highest accuracy without drawbacks. Cyberattacks on natural gas installations go much the same way as it would with attacks on electrical grids. Cyberterrorists can shutdown these installations stopping the flow or they can even reroute gas flows to another section that can be occupied by one of their allies. There was a case in Russia with a gas supplier known as Gazprom, they lost control of their central switchboard which routes gas flow, after an inside operator and Trojan horse program bypassed security.\nThe 2021 Colonial Pipeline cyberattack caused a sudden shutdown of the pipeline that carried 45% of the gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel consumed on the East Coast of the United States.\nWind farms, both onshore and offshore, are also at risk from cyber attacks. In February 2022, a German wind turbine maker, Enercon, lost remote connection to some 5,800 turbines following a large-scale disruption of satellite links. In April 2022, another company, Deutsche Windtechnik, also lost control of roughly 2,000 turbines because of a cyber-attack. While the wind turbines were not damaged during these incidents, these attacks illustrate just how vulnerable their computer systems are.\nFinance\nFinancial infrastructures could be hit hard by cyberattacks as the financial system is linked by computer systems. Money is constantly being exchanged in these institutions and if cyberterrorists were to attack and if transactions were rerouted and large amounts of money stolen, financial industries would collapse and civilians would be without jobs and security. Operations would stall from region to region causing nationwide economic degradation. In the U.S. alone, the average daily volume of transactions hit $3 trillion and 99% of it is non-cash flow. To be able to disrupt that amount of money for one day or for a period of days can cause lasting damage making investors pull out of funding and erode public confidence.\nA cyberattack on a financial institution or transactions may be re",
    "2024 deadly storm system affecting South Africa\nOn 1-5 June 2024, a large storm system produced severely heavy rainfall and winds along the Eastern coast of South Africa, striking several municipalities in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The storm produced two tornados in KwaZulu-Natal province around the Durban metro region, with the more intense tornado striking Tongaat.\nBackground\nOn 1 June 2024, South African Weather Service reported that South Africa was going under a cut-off low pressure system, which occurs when a low pressure system detaches from a jet stream. The agency predicted that it would stall over the Eastern coast of South Africa area for several days and produce heavy rain, severe winds, and a cold snap with the potential for hail.\nOn the same day, The South African Weather Service issued a Yellow Level 6 warning in areas of the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Northern Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, where they predicted flooding, snowfall, hail, and strong winds would occur.\nImpact\nDuring the afternoon of 3 June 2024, the storm complex produced two tornados in the area surrounding the coastal port city of Durban that struck Newcastle, Utrecht, Ballito and Tongaat. The first tornado developed in Northeastern KwaZulu-Nata between Newcastle and Utrecht, starting off as a rope tornado before developing into a cone tornado. The larger and stronger of the tornados formed near Tongaat later in the afternoon, and developed into a wedge tornado that moved eastwards towards the eastern coast between Westbrook and Ballito before dissipating. It caused the most severe damage in Tongaat, severely damaging several homes, felling trees, destroying power lines, and causing blackouts. At least 11 people were killed in KwaZulu-Nata province as a result of the tornadic storms system, seven of whom were in Tongaat, and other fatalities occurring in Nquthu, Eshowe, and KwaHlabisa. There were reports of looting in Tongaat following the tornados.\nThe storm also produced significant rainfall and hailstorms that led to flooding that caused at least 11 deaths in Eastern Cape province. Over 2,000 people had to be evacuated from the Nelson Mandela Bay, many from makeshift homes in slums of the region. At least 55 people received mild to moderate injuries requiring hospital treatment. Red Cross noted that Nelson Mandela Bay and Buffalo City metropolitan areas suffered the worst flooding, with the heavy rainfall leading to dam breaches and overflowing canals. Damage from flooding was also reported in Sarah Baartman District Municipality, while the dam near Tyriville was at risk of collapsing. Buildings, sweer systems, roads, and water facilities, and electrical infrastructure was damaged across the Nelson Mandela Bay metro, while bridges were destroyed in Kwanobuhle.\nThe rainfall and flooding caused significant damage to wheat and canola agriculture in the Overberg area due to the 200 mm rainfall over-saturating the ground, causing erosion, removing fertile top soil, and destroying roads and bridges that could allow farmers to reach their crops.\nThe cut-off low system caused temperatures to drop below 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) in five provinces of South Africa including Free State, leading to the first snowfall of the year in South Africa, of up to 30 cm across different regions.\nSee also\n2022 KwaZulu-Natal floods\n2022 Eastern Cape floods\nCape storm (2017)\nWeather of 2024\n",
    "\nEvents in 1886 in animation.\nEvents\nSpecific date unknown:\nHenri Rivi\u00e8re created a form of shadow theatre at the Chat Noir under the name \"ombres chinoises\". This was a notable success, lasting for a decade until the cafe closed in 1897. He used back-lit zinc cut-out figures which appeared as silhouettes. Rivi\u00e8re was soon joined by Caran d'Ache and other artists, initially performing d'Ache's drama L\u2019Epopee. From 1886 to 1896, Rivi\u00e8re created 43 shadow plays on a great variety of subjects from myth, history and the Bible. He collaborated with many different artists and writers, but made the illustrations for only 9 of the productions himself.  He concentrated on improving the technical aspects of the production by using enamelling and lighting to create extremely delicate effects of light and colour. The Ombres evolved into numerous theatrical productions and had a major influence on phantasmagoria. The technique is considered a precursor to silhouette animation.\nIn 1886, Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz developed the Electrotachyscope, an early device that displayed short motion picture loops with 24 glass plate photographs on a 1.5 meter wide rotating wheel that was hand-cranked to the speed of circa 30 frames per second. Different versions were shown at many international exhibitions, fairs, conventions and arcades from 1887 until at least 1894. \nBirths\nFebruary\nFebruary 8: Charlie Ruggles, American actor (voice of Benjamin Franklin in Ben and Me, Aesop in the Aesop and Son segments in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends), (d. 1970).\nMarch\nMarch 2: Willis H.

Among her most notable works is her participation as presenter of the programs \u00a1Qu\u00e9 importa! (2016\u20132020) and \u00a1Qu\u00e9 chulada! (2020\u20132024), and her roles as an actress in the films Polar Bear (2017) and Impossible Things (2021).\nEarly life and education\nVer\u00f3nica Er\u00e9ndira Toussaint Rinc\u00f3n Gallardo was born on 15 March 1976 in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, being the youngest of three children of a family therapist and florist. Her family, well off financially, was originally from Mexico City, so shortly after she was born she was taken to live there. She graduated with a degree in communication from the Universidad An\u00e1huac M\u00e9xico, a private institution. However, Toussaint's true passion was acting, so she decided to train as an actress at the N\u00facleo de Estudios Teatrales, a private school specialized in training actors.\nCareer\nIn 2001, Toussaint made her debut as an actress, participating with a supporting role in the telenovela Cara o cruz, produced by Telemundo. Years later, she established himself at the television station Imagen Televisi\u00f3n, where she established herself as a comedian thanks to the program \u00a1Qu\u00e9 importa!, a comedy news broadcast that he joined in 2016 and which he left in 2020. In 2018, she received her first and only Ariel Award in the category of best female co-acting, a prize obtained thanks to her work in the 2017 film Polar Bear. This production also earned her the award for best actress at the 2018 Hermosillo International Film Festival.\nIn 2021, Toussaint had a supporting role in the film Impossible Things, which although it was very brief and without dialogue, stood out for her lip synchronization singing the song \"El d\u00eda\" performed by Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda.\nFrom 2020 and until the end of her career, she was the host of the Imagen Televisi\u00f3n program, \u00a1Qu\u00e9 chulada!, in which in 2021, she publicly shared that she had breast cancer.\nIllness and death\nOn 16 May 2024, after being hospitalized for ten days in a hospital in Mexico City, Toussaint died at the age of 48, due to breast cancer she suffered from. Two days later, after her funeral was held at the Pante\u00f3n Franc\u00e9s de San Joaqu\u00edn, her body was cremated and her ashes were delivered to her family. Her brother shared that at Toussaint's will, her remains would be scattered in a place they would choose later.\n",
    "South African judge (born 1958)\nJohn Eldrid Smith (born 5 November 1958) is a South African judge of the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa. He joined the bench in July 2010. Before that, he was the chief executive officer of Smith Tabata Inc., which he co-founded in 1984.\nEarly life and education\nSmith was born on 5 November 1958 in Herschel, a small town near Sterkspruit in what was then the Cape Province (now the Eastern Cape). He grew up in nearby Queenstown, matriculating in 1976 at Maria Louw High School. He is Coloured.\nAfter high school, he completed a BA in law at the University of the Western Cape in 1979 and an LLB at Rhodes University in 1981. Later, while a practising lawyer, he completed a diploma in advanced labour law at the University of Cape Town in 1989.\nLegal career\nBetween 1982 and 1984, Smith completed his articles of clerkship under T. M. Mdlalana, an attorney based in the Eastern Cape. He was admitted as an attorney in 1984. Later the same year, he co-founded the firm of Smith, Tabata and Van Heerden, which was later reincorporated as Smith Tabata Inc. While working there as a partner, he was active in progressive professional organisations: among other things, he joined the National Association of Democratic Lawyers in 1983 and ultimately joined its senior leadership, serving as its national vice-president from 1989 to 1990 and as its general secretary from 1990 to 1992. During the same period, he was a trustee of the Legal Resources Centre.\nAfter the end of apartheid, Smith served briefly as a member of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature from 1994 to 1995. Thereafter he remained in partnership at his firm for the rest of his career in practice; he was the firm's chief executive officer between 2007 and 2010. At the same time, between 1998 and 2010, he served several stints as an acting judge in the Grahamstown High Court and Bhisho High Court. Finally, he chaired the Ministerial Committee of Inquiry into Transformation in Cricket, which was appointed by Minister of Sport Ngconde Balfour in 2001.\nEastern Cape High Court: 2010\u2013present\nIn April 2010 in Cape Town, Smith was interviewed by the Judicial Service Commission as a candidate for possible permanent appointment to the bench of the High Court of South Africa. The JSC recommended his appointment, which President Jacob Zuma confirmed the following month. He took office on 26 July 2010 in the Eastern Cape Division, and he was based at the division's seat in Grahamstown. Over the next 14 years, only four of his judgments were overturned on appeal, and he wrote 14 reported judgments. According to Judges Matter, he distinguished himself in property law matters.\nIn 2017, he was one of four candidates shortlisted for promotion to become the division's Judge President, but, after he and three other candidates were interviewed in Midrand in April, the Judicial Service Commission declined to make an appointment; the position ultimately went to Selby Mbenenge.\nWhile serving in the High Court, Smith spent three terms as an acting judge in the Supreme Court of Appeal, first from October 2021 to March 2022 and then from April 2024 to September 2024. He wrote for majority judgments for the appellate court. During that period, he was thrice interviewed as a candidate for possible elevation to permanent vacancies in the Supreme Court. Both in his October 2022 interview and in his October 2023 interview, Judge of Appeal Xola Petse pressed him on deficiencies in his writing. On neither occasion did the Judicial Service Commission recommend Smith for appointment. The commission's October 2023 deliberations were later made public in court filings, and it transpired that Smith had been one of the top five candidates (among ten in total) but had failed to receive the support of a majority of the panel. The third time he was shortlisted, as one of ten candidates for three vacancies in May 2024, his interview was successful; the Judicial Service Commission said that it would recommend Smith, along with Judges David Unterhalter and Raylene Keightley, as suitable for elevation to the Supreme Court.\nPersonal life\nHe is married to Naomi Josephine Smith and has two children.\n",

    "Pistol cartridge\n.38 Taurus Pistol Caliber is a metallic centerfire ammunition that uses smokeless powder to be originally used in pistols.\nIt was developed by Taurus in partnership with CBC from 2023, with the aim of providing a caliber to the Brazilian market that meets the new legislation on \"permitted\" calibers that established a maximum of 407 joules of energy at the muzzle.\nHistory\nThe project began at the end of 2023, when the new Brazilian government's intention to impose legislation that would limit the energy at the muzzle of \"permitted\" guns had already been announced, which ended up being established at 407 joules (?). It was announced that the new caliber would be 40% more powerful than the current .380 caliber, and with less recoil and also at a lower price than the 9mm Luger.\nThe official launch of the .38 TPC caliber in Brazil, along with new weapons for it, took place at an event held on June 6, 2024.\nDimensions\nTechnical characteristics\nWith this caliber, the aim was to provide an intermediate between the .380 ACP and the 9 mm Luger, generating something between 380 and 400 joules of energy at the muzzle depending on the ammunition used, which is within the established limits by the new Federal Government decree for \"permitted\" caliber weapons.\nCompared to the .380, the .38 TPC has greater velocity and energy at the exit of the barrel, 40% higher. Compared to the 9mm, the .38 TPC has up to 28% less recoil, providing greater comfort and shooting control, as well as rapid aim recovery between shots. All of these characteristics are beneficial in sports competitions of speed and precision, like the IPSC ones.\n.38 TPC ammunition also meets FBI Protocol ballistic penetration requirements. In a comparative test with the .380 Auto Gold Hex ammunition, the .38 TPC caliber showed 14.5 inches (36.83\u00a0cm) of penetration into ballistic gelatin, therefore within the ideal range specified by the FBI in tests at distances of 10 feet (3 meters).\nAs for the cartridge case, it is basically the same as a \"shortened\" (less than 1mm) 9mm Luger from 19.15mm to 18.30mm.\nSee also\n9 mm caliber\nList of handgun cartridges\nTable of handgun and rifle cartridges\nNotes\n^ According to official data from the manufacturer, the standard nominal speed is 386 joules.\n^ The FBI parameters on ballistic gelatin penetration are:\nminimum acceptable 12\";\nmaximum desirable 18\";\nideal range from 14\" to 16\".\n",
    "A cartoon titled The Press and the Cabinet Formation by Johan Braakensiek. Abraham Kuyper is working at the top while the journalists outside try to see what is happening inside.\nA process of cabinet formation took place following the Dutch general election of 14 and 27 June 1901.\nThe formation resulted in the Kuyper cabinet on 1 August 1901. It was the second coalition cabinet, because it consisted of Catholics and the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP). It was further supported by the Free Anti-Revolutionary Party (VAR) and the Christian Historical Union (CHU).\nThe confessional victory and the role of Abraham Kuyper in it meant that Kuyper was appointed as formateur by queen Wilhelmina. The confessional parties managed to reach an agreement on the government program within a week and a half. However, the appointment of ministers almost caused the formation to fail, especially for Interior. After Kuyper finally decided to lead that department himself, he was able to complete the formation.\nBackground\nAfter ten years of liberal cabinets, of which Pierson cabinet was the most recent, the liberals suffered a significant loss in the 1901 Dutch cabinet. The confessional parties obtained 47 seats in the first round on 14 June and rose to 58 of the 100 seats in the second round of voting. The largest group was the Catholics with 25 seats, immediately followed by the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) with 24 seats. The other confessional parties were the Free Anti-Revolutionary Party (7 seats), the Christian Historical Union (CHK, 1 seat) and the Friese Bond (1 seat). These parties did not have a majority in the Senate. The parties could obtain this by dissolution of the Senate, because they had also won significantly in the simultaneously held Provincial Council elections of 1901.\nConstultations\nQueen Wilhelmina, 1901.\nOn 2, 3 and 4 July, the queen Wilhelmina, who took office in 1898, received her most important counselors; Chairman of the Senate Albertus van Naamen van Eemnes, Minister of State Johan George Gleichman and Vice President of the Council of State Johan Willem Meinard Schorer. The three counselors - with a liberal background - considered ARP leader Abraham Kuyper the most logical  formateur. A Catholic formateur, despite being the largest party, would encounter too much resistance. Van Naamen van Eemnes and Gleichman did advise consulting other confessional politicians in advance, which Gleichman advised against to remain neutral. Van Naamen van Eemnes advised the queen to ask for guarantees on a number of issues, such as Dutch neutrality in the Second Boer War, continuation of the Aceh War, as little state interference as possible in the social field and as minimum increase of import duties. These were topics that Kuyper thought differently about.\nEven before the discussions with the liberal counselors, she had asked the director of the Queen's Cabinet Petrus Johannes Vegelin van Claerbergen to seek advice from the anti-revolutionary state council Ulrich Herman Huber, the free anti-revolutionary leader Alexander de Savornin Lohman and the former ARP prime minister \u00c6neas Mackay (who had to return from Austrian-Hungarian Teplice). They also pointed to Kuyper as formateur, despite the differences they noted between the confessional parties.\nFormateur Kuyper\nPreliminary discussions\nFormateur Abraham Kuyper, 1905.\nAlthough Kuyper was dreading the formateurship, which he still suspected would go to Mackay, Kuyper started approaching potential ministers within his own circle even before his appointment. He also asked Mackay, who indicated that he was not available for the position of minister and formateur. On 1 July, he also sent a request to the Catholic faction asking it to form a committee from among its members with whom the anti-revolutionaries could negotiate a government program. The faction would agree to this and announce on 10 July that this committee would consist of faction leader Herman Schaepman, Jan Harte van Tecklenburg and Jacobus Antonius Nicolaas Travaglino.\nOn 11 July, Kuyper came to talk to Wilhelmina at Palace Het Loo. Wilhelmina asked if he could agree to continuing the Aceh policy of General Jo van Heutsz, the neutrality in the Boer War and the continuation of the army reform of minister Arthur Kool. Kuyper agreed with all points. The issue of duties was not mentioned, because Mackay had already reassured Wilhelmina that Kuyper was only moderately in favor of it. Wilhelmina then offered him the formateurship. However, Kuyper requested to be allowed to consider this for two days, due to difficulties in becoming a minister in the cabinet himself. Wilhelmina agreed. He also proposed splitting the ministry of Water Management, Trade and Industry into the ministry of Water Management and Transport, and the ministry of Labor and Business. The latter would be the ministry for which he considered himself suitable.\nThe reason for the delay was largely due to the free anti-revolutionaries, whom Kuy",
    "Rail trail in St. Mary's County, MD\nThe Three Notch Trail is a 10.6-mile (17.1\u00a0km), shared-use rail trail in the US state of Maryland. It currently runs on the right-of-way of the old U.S. Naval Air Station Railroad from Deborah Drive in Hughesville, MD just inside Charles County to Baggett Park in Mechanicsville, MD. It is almost entirely within St. Mary's County. The county plans to extend the trail south to Pegg Road in Lexington Park, MD and possibly as far as Great Mills Road. Three smaller sections totaling about 5000 feet have been constructed in California, MD as part of other construction projects.\nIt gets it's name from the nearby Three Notch Road, the main highway between northern St. Mary's and Point Lookout since the pre-colonial days. The name is attributed to a 1704 law that stipulated \"three notches of equal distance\" be marked on trees to indicate the road leading to a ferry.\nHistory\nThe trail runs on the abandoned right-of-way of the U.S. Naval Air Station Railroad. The railroad north from Mechanicsville was graded in 1872-1873 and built in 1881-1883 by the Southern Maryland Railroad with intentions to take it all the way to Point Lookout in Scotland, MD. It was extended 2.5 miles in the 1920s to south Mechanicsville when it was the Washington, Brandywine & Point Lookout Railroad. It was extended again in 1942, after it had been purchased by the Navy, to the Naval Air Station Patuxent River and was officially alled the U.S. Naval Air Station Railroad, but sometimes by other names including the Brandywine and Cedar Point Railroad. When operating the train became too expensive, passenger service was ended in 1954. The Pennsylvania Railroad continued using the line to deliver aviation fuel into the 1960s, but when it started being brought by barge, service ended completely.\nOn June 26, 1970, 28 miles of the ROW in the county was purchased by St. Mary's County for a utility right-of-way. Part of the ROW was used to widen MD-235.\nTalk of constructing a hiking/biking trail on the railroad right-of-way started almost immediately, but planning for the trail wouldn't start for 30 years.\nConstruction of the trail started in 2005 and Phase I, running one mile from MD Route 236 in New Market, MD to the Northern County Senior Center in Charlotte Hall, was officially opened on June 3, 2006. Phase II, from the Northern County Senior Center to Deborah Drive just inside Charles County opened in October, 2008. Work on Phase 5, a disconnected section in south Mechanicsville from Baggett Park to near MD Route 5, broke ground in 2010 and was complete in the spring of 2011. Phase VI, at first delayed due to a conflict about how it would pass through the property of Immaculate Conception Church, was completed in 2016. This section passes through Mechanicsville and closed the gap between Phase I and Phase V.\nPhase III, a 2-mile long section from Chancellors Run in California, MD to FDR Boulevard in Wildewood, MD has been partially contructed in pieces by developers. The central piece, stretching about 950feet north from Old Rolling Road, was built in 2005 as part of the adjacent South Plaza Shopping Center. The northernmost piece, from FDR Boulevard to the driveway of the electrical power substation about 750 feet south along Three Notch Road/MD-235, was built around 2010 as part of the nearby Sturbridge Homes project. And the southernmost piece, which is the longest one at ~3400 feet long, runs north from Chancellors Run Road to a deadend near 45440 Miramar Way. It was also built around 2010. \nPhase IV-B, a 1.8 mile section from Pegg Road in Lexington Park to Chancellors Run Road in California is being built as part of Phase 3 of the FDR Boulevard Project. Phase 3A of that project, from MD 237 to Buck Hewitt Rd was completed on November 14, 2023. Phase 3b is expected to be completed in 2025.\nIn 2018, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan's administration awarded St. Mary's County  $4.1 million from two separate state and federal grant programs for the construction of phase VII - the 3.3 mile section from FDR Boulevard in California to Rescue Lane in Hollywood, MD.  In September 2023, Maryland Governor Wes Moore announced $1.2 million in additional funds for the phase VII, as part of the Kim Lamphier Bikeways Network Program by the Maryland Department of Transportation.\n",

Following the enemy breakthrough that occurred, the Russian units suffered irreparable losses, and the commander of the regiment was captured.\nAfter a heavy defeat, the regiment received reinforcements, and participated in local battles. In beginning of 1915, the regiment held the defense in the Volya-Shidlovskaya area. In February 1915, the regiment was in the reserve of the 2nd Army of the Northwestern Front. In March 1915, the regiment occupied defenses near the Ravka River, along the Skierniewitz - Bolimov line. On 30 April 1915, the 67th Division was incorporated into the 35th Army Corps. In May 1915, the regiment was stationed in the Wola Szyd\u0142owska area. In beginning of July 1915, under the threat of encirclement, elements of the regiment made a systematic retreat to the Zhirardov area, and on 20 July, took up positions along the right bank of the Vistula. On 3 August 1915, the regiment drove the enemy out of the village of Zolotki, where for two days they covered the withdrawal routes of the army's right flank across the Nurets River. From 20 to 22 August 1915, despite the withdrawal of the neighboring division, the regiment held its position near the town of Mstibovo, allowing the 67th Division to carry out a night counterattack. On 9 August 1915, bloody battles continued near the village of Partsevo. On 25 August, the regiment reached the area of the Servech River. Under threat of encirclement, the 67th Division fought back from Poland to Belarus. In September 1915, the Vilno-Dvinsk offensive took place, which the regiment suffered heavy losses.\nWestern Front\nIn March 1916, the regiment took part in the Lake Naroch offensive. The regiment was in the reserves of commander Baluev in the Andreika area, then moved to the area of Lake Slobodskoye. On 24 March 1916, the regiment distinguished itself when capturing the heights south of Lake Naroch, followed by the occupation of enemy trenches in the area of the village of Mokritsa. Despite significant losses, 102 enemy soldiers and an officer were captured. After the offensive, the regiment from the Molodechno region was regrouped on the Tarasevichi - Lake Vishnevskoe line. In beginning of June 1916, the regiment was in the reserves, occupying positions northeast of Baranovichi. On 4 July 1916, the unit was transferred to the group reserve in the Rossoch tract. On the night of 10 and 11 July, having replaced the grenadier division, the unit took positions in front of the Gornoe Skrobovo farm, taking part in the Baranovichi offensive, and suffered significant losses. Heavy fighting in the area of the Skrobov manor's yard continued until the end of the autumn of 1916, with the enemy using flamethrowers. The regiment's personnel exemplified courage and heroism.\nIn mid-January 1917, the regiment was transferred to the Molodechno region. On 13 February, it received an order to take positions near Lake Vishnevskoye. From the end of May 1917, it was stationed in the town of Izha. In July 1917, the regiment took part in the battles for Smorgon.\nBanner\nThe battle flag was granted on 27 August 1914, a simple banner of the 1900 model. The border is white, the embroidery is gold. Pommel Model 1857 (Army). The shaft is white. Savior Not Made by Hands. Perfect condition. Fate unknown.\nRussian Revolution\nAfter the February ",

A sequel to Arizona Sunshine (2016), the game was released for virtual reality devices such as Meta Quest headsets, PlayStation VR2, SteamVR and Pico 4 in December 2023.\nGameplay\nLike its predecessor, Arizona Shsine 2 is a first-person shooter set in a desert located in Arizona, in which the player must survive a zombie apocalypse. The player character has access to a large variety of firearms such as shotguns and flamethrowers, and melee weapons such as crowbars, pickaxes, and machetes. Melee combat was significantly updated for the game with a \"new mutilation and gore system\". Throughout the game, the player is accompanied by a companion dog named Buddy, who will assist the player in combat as well as fetching items from faraway for the player.\nThe single-player campaign offers four different difficulty options. It can also be played cooperatively with another player. The game also features a horde mode, which enables four players to combat endless waves of enemies. Players can also view an online leaderboard to compare their performances with other players around the globe. Additional maps for the horde mode will be released following the game's release.\nReception\nArizona Sunshine 2 received \"mixed or average\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.\nDan Stepleton from IGN wrote that \"Arizona Sunshine 2 keeps the pressure on for a long campaign of zombie slaying full of satisfyingly gory head shots, entertaining humor, and the bond between a lonely man and his dog\". He liked the variation in gameplay design, though he felt the game lacked enemy variety. Mark Delaney from GameSpot praised the inclusion of Buddy in the game for adding more complexity to gameplay, as well as the game's improved melee combat and setpieces. However, he disliked the game's story for being predictable and the main protagonist for being \"an unfunny dweeb\".\nReference\n^ Harris, Kieran (October 29, 2013). \"Arizona Sunshine 2 releases December 7 on PSVR 2, Meta Quest, and Steam VR\".

    "Ecuadorian politician\nTito Galo Lara Y\u00e9pez is an Ecuadorian politician and criminal who represented Los R\u00edos Province in the National Assembly of Ecuador from 2009 to 2013. Lara was falesly convicted of abetting the murder of a couple and their four-year-old child in 2013, and sentenced to ten years in prison by Ecuadorian authorities. Lara fled to Panama, and was eventually declared innocent with his trial being considered a political persecution campaign by the Rafael Correa government.\nBiography\nLara was born in Quevedo on January 4, 1968. He was implicated in the death of a woman in Quevedo in 1990, but fled the country before he could go on trial. In 2007, Lara was elected as an assemblyman for Los Rios province in the Patriotic Society Party. He was re-elected in 2008 following the 2008 Ecuadorian constitutional referendum, and stayed as an assemblyman until 2013.\nOn August 4, 2011, three members of a family were killed in Quinsaloma Canton. The murder was alleged to have been ordered by Lara and his girlfriend. In 2012, a federal prosecutor ordered Lara to remain in the country until the murder investigation was over. Lara was acquitted that December, but his girlfriend was found guilty in the murders. On September 2, 2013, after Lara had already left his office as assemblyman, the National Court of Ecuador convicted Lara of being an accomplice in the murders and sentenced him to ten years in prison.\nLara fled to Panama on October 22, 2013, seeking asylum as a political prisoner. Panama granted asylum to Lara, but revoked his asylum in June 2014. The Ecuadorian government demanded Lara's extradition back to Ecuador, but Lara instead sought to stay as a refugee. Lara was extradited back to Ecuador and served time in prison until 2018. That year, a new court stated that Lara had been accused as part of a political persecution campaign by then-president Rafael Correa.\nLara and his girlfriend Carolina Llanos were declared innocent in 2021 as there was not enough evidence to link the two to the murders. Lara and Llanos received compensation for the campaign in 2021 by Guillermo Lasso.\n",
    "An illustration of Heluo fish from the 18th-century Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China.\nIn Chinese mythology, Heluo fish (simplified Chinese: \u4f55\u7f57\u9c7c; traditional Chinese: \u4f55\u7f85\u9b5a; pinyin: H\u00e9lu\u00f3y\u00fa) and Zi fish (simplified Chinese: \u8308\u9c7c; traditional Chinese: \u8308\u9b5a; pinyin: Z\u01d0y\u00fa) are fish with one head and ten bodies.\nDescriptions\nThe ancient text Classic of Mountains and Seas explains (trans. Anne Birrell):\n...Four hundred leagues further north is a mountain called Mount Burnbright. The River Burning rises here and flows west to empty into the Great River. The River Burning contains many what-not fish  with one head and ten bodies. They make a noise like a dog barking. If you eat them, they will cure cancerous growths.\u2014\u200aBook Three, The Classic of the Northern Mountains, Chapter 1\n...The River Limpid rises here and flows northeast to empty into the sea. This river contains many fine cowrie shells and numerous red-dye fish  which look like perch. They have one head and ten bodies, and they smell like the scent-herb. If you eat them, you won't have attacks of farting.\u2014\u200aBook Four, The Classic of the Eastern Mountains, Chapter 4\nIn the 1827 fantasy novel Flowers in the Mirror by Li Ruzhen, the protagonist Tang Ao encountered such a creature in a fishing net at the \"Country of Black-bottomed People\" and wondered whether it was the fragrant Zi fish. His brother-in-law Lin Zhiyang smelled it and retched, whereupon Duo Jiugong\u2014their companion\u2014laughed and suggested kicking it. When it barked like a dog, they all knew that it was a Heluo fish. Old Duo then explained the difference between the species: \"One smells heavenly, and the other extremely foul.\"\nXiujiu bird\nIn the 16th century, Yang Shen wrote in Encomiums on Strange Fish (\u7570\u9b5a\u5716\u8d0a, 1544) that, just like the Kun fish (which can transform itself into a bird), the Heluo fish can also change into a bird known as Xiujiu (\u4f11\u820a), notorious for stealing husked rice and falling into mortars, dead. The Xiujiu bird often shrieked as it flew by at night and unlike the Heluo fish, it was scared of thunder and lightning.\nSee also\nCephalopod, marine animals with one head and numerous arms or tentacles\n",
    "\nThe Unisphere at the fair\nThe 1964 New York World's Fair took place at Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park in Queens, New York, United States, during 1964 and 1965. The fair included 139 pavilions with exhibits by 80 nations, 24 U.S. states, and 350 corporations. The exhibits were split across five regions\u2014the Federal and State, International, Transportation, Amusement, and Industrial areas\u2014which in turn were centered around the Unisphere.\nThe New York World's Fair 1964 Corporation (WFC) oversaw the 1964 fair and leased out the land to exhibitors, who developed their own pavilions. The different sections were designed in various architectural styles. Anyone could rent exhibition space as long as they could afford to rent the land and pay for their pavilion, though U.S. state pavilions could rent land for free. Many nations from Asia, Africa, and Central and South America, though relatively few from Europe, exhibited at the fair. The fairground also hosted many large corporations, in addition to eight religious pavilions, a fraternal order pavilion, and other exhibits. After the fair, some pavilions were preserved or relocated, but the vast majority of structures were demolished.\nBackground\nFair\nThe New York World's Fair 1964 Corporation (WFC) was formed in 1959 to organize a world's fair in New York City during 1964. The Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) refused to formally approve the 1964 New York World's Fair, despite advocacy from WFC president Robert Moses. Moses wanted to save the WFC money by having exhibitors erect most of their own pavilions. Nearly all buildings were to be temporary structures. Exhibitors designed their own pavilions, which were built by local labor unions. William Everett Potter, who was hired to organize the exhibits, predicted that the pavilions would use relatively novel construction methods such as structural plastics, thin-shell structures, and prestressed concrete. Construction of the first building began in 1960. The World's Fair officially opened on April 22, 1964, and its first season ended on October 18, 1964. The fair reopened for a second and final season on April 21, 1965, closing on October 18, 1965.\nThe fairground was divided into five regions, centered around the Unisphere, a representation of the Earth constructed by American Bridge Company. Exhibits for individual U.S. states and the U.S. federal government were concentrated in the Federal & State Area at the center of the fairground near the Unisphere. The international exhibits were concentrated in the International Area\u2014a group of pavilions surrounding the Unisphere. Industry pavilions were concentrated around the Industrial Area on the eastern end near the Van Wyck Expressway. The Transportation Area was on the western side of the fairground. South of the Long Island Expressway, connected with the rest of the fair only via one overpass, was the Lake Amusement Area. The 1964 World's Fair had 139 pavilions and 34 other attractions on its opening day. Either 121 or 124 pavilions and attractions were free; the rest required an additional payment. The last pavilion to be completed was the Belgian Village, which was not finished until the end of the 1964 season.\nNo new pavilions were planned for the 1965 season because it would be costly and time-consuming to add any such pavilions. Between the 1964 and 1965 seasons, several exhibitors renovated and modified their pavilions. At least fifty exhibits were upgraded, and five major attractions were added. Some exhibitors increased the capacity of their attractions, while other pavilions received new exhibits or interior renovations. The Florida pavilion took over much of the Lake Amusement Area, which became known as the Lake Area.\nPavilions\nThe Wisconsin Pavilion, which has since been relocated to WisconsinThe different sections were designed in various architectural styles, and many of the pavilions were designed in a Space Age style. The New York Times described the buildings as a collection of \"domes, disks, cubes, spires, pylons, ovids, arches, triangles, curves and soaring free forms.\" Some pavilions used experimental designs, such as the Bell System, GE, IBM, Kodak, and Port Authority pavilions. Most structures were designed so they could be demolished easily after the fair and rebuilt elsewhere. Most of the state pavilions, and many of the industrial and transportation pavilions, were wheelchair-accessible. However, many of the international pavilions were not fully accessible because these pavilions were often designed in traditional architectural styles.\nAnyone could rent exhibition space as long as they could afford to rent the land, and pay for their pavilion. Thus, the space was dominated by large corporations. Private companies spent a combined $300 million on their pavilions, and companies such as General Motors and Ford Motor Company spent tens of millions of dollars apiece. Several companies funded their pavilions by reducing promotional spending e",

    "Theorem in computability theory\nIn computability theory, Selman's theorem is a theorem relating enumeration reducibility with enumerability relative to oracles. It is named after Alan Selman, who proved it as part of his PhD thesis in 1971.\nStatement\nInformally, a set A is enumeration-reducible to a set B if there is a Turing machine which receives an enumeration of B (it has a special instruction to get the next element, or none if it has not yet been provided), and produces an enumeration of A. See enumeration reducibility for a precise account.\nA set A is computably enumerable with oracle B (or simply \"in B\") when there is a Turing machine with oracle B which enumerates the members of A; this is the relativized version of computable enumerability.\nSelman's theorem: A set A is enumeration-reducible to a set B if and only if A is computably enumerable with an oracle X whenever B is computably enumerable with the same oracle X.\nDiscussion\nInformally, the hypothesis means that whenever there is a program enumerating B using some source of information (the oracle), there is also a program enumerating A using the same source of information. A priori, the program enumerating A could be running the program enumerating B as a subprogram in order to produce the elements of A from those of B, but it could also be using the source of information directly, perhaps in a different way than the program enumerating B, and it could be difficult to deduce from the program enumerating B. However, the theorem asserts that, in fact, there exists a single program which produces an enumeration of A solely from an enumeration of B, without direct access to the source of information used to enumerate B.\nFrom a slightly different point of view, the theorem is an automatic uniformity result. Let P be the set of total computable functions f\u00a0: \u2115 \u2192 \u2115 \u222a {\u22a5} such that the range of f with \u22a5 removed equals A, and let Q be similarly defined for B. A possible reformulation of the theorem is that if P is Mu\u010dnik-reducible to Q, then it is also Medvedev-reducible to Q. :\u200a5\u200a. Informally: if every enumeration of B can be used to compute an enumeration of A, then there is a single (uniform) oracle Turing machine which computes some enumeration of A whenever it is given an enumeration of B as the oracle.\nProof\nIf A is enumeration-reducible to B and B is computably enumerable with oracle X, then A is computably enumerable with oracle X (it suffices to compose a machine that enumerates A given an enumeration of B with a machine that enumerates B with an oracle X).\nConversely, assume that A is not enumeration-reducible to B. We shall build X such that B is computably enumerable with oracle X, but A is not.\nLet  denote some computable pairing function. We build X as a set of elements  where , such that for each , there is at least one pair  in X. This ensures that B is computably enumerable with oracle X (through a semi-algorithm that takes an input x and searches for y such that ).\nThe construction of X is done by stages, following the priority method. It is convenient to view the eventual value of X as an infinite bit string (i-th bit is the boolean ) which is constructed by incrementally appending to a finite bit string. Initially, X is the empty string.\nWe describe the n-th step of the construction. It extends X in two ways.\nFirst, we ensure that X has a 1 bit at some index , where x is the n-th element of X. If there is none yet, we choose y large enough such that the index  is outside the current string X, and we add a 1 bit at this index (padding with 0 bits before it). Doing this ensures that in the eventual value of X, there is some pair  for each .\nSecond, let us call \"admissible extension\" an extension of the current X which respects the property that 1 bits are pairs .  Denote by M the n-th oracle Turing machine. We use M(Z) to mean M associated to a specific oracle Z (if Z is a finite bit string, out of bounds requests return 0).\nWe distinguish three cases.\n1. There is an admissible extension Y such that M(Y) enumerates some x that is not in A. Fix such an x. We further extend Y by padding it with 0s until all oracle queries that were used by M(Y) before enumerating x become in bounds, and we set X to this extended Y. This ensures that, however X is later extended, M(X) does not enumerate A, as it enumerates x which is not in A.\n2. There is some value x in A which is not enumerated by any M(Y), for any admissible extension Y. In this case, we do not change X; it is already ensured that eventually M(X) will not enumerate A, because it cannot enumerate x \u2014 indeed, if it did, this would be done after a finite number of oracle invocations, which would lie in some admissible extension Y.\n3. We show that the remaining case is absurd. Here, we know that\nall values enumerated by M(Y), for Y admissible extension, are in A, and conversely, every element of A is enumerated by M(Y) for at least one admissible extension Y. In other words, A is exactly",

He is a professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University.\nSingh is most known for researching RNA biology and molecular genetics; particularly for the invention of the Intron Splicing Silencer N1 (ISS-N1) target that led to the first FDA-approved drug (Spinraza/Nusinersen) for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). He is the recipient of several awards, including the Salsbury Endowment at Iowa State University and the 2006 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).\nEducation\nSingh earned a B.Sc. in Chemistry in 1983 and an M.Sc. in Biochemistry in 1985, both from Banaras Hindu University. He received a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the Institute of Biochemistry and Physiology of Microorganisms at the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1993.\nCareer\nSingh began his academic career as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, holding an appointment initially at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, then at Oregon State University, and later at the University of Texas at Austin. In 2001, he became a Special and Scientific Staff and Research Assistant Professor at the New England Medical Center and Tufts University School of Medicine, followed by an appointment as assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Massachusetts, where he worked on the development of the ISS-N1 until 2007. He joined Iowa State University as an associate professor in 2007 and was named the Salsbury Endowed Chair in Veterinary Medicine from 2008 to 2016. Since 2012, he has been serving as a professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University, where he leads the Singh research group. He is also affiliated with the Roy J. Carver Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Molecular Biology at Iowa State University, where he served as the member of the Biotechnology Council and Graduate Council.\nResearch\nAs an independent investigator, Singh has contributed to the field of molecular biology by studying the mechanism of alternative splicing, particularly in the context of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and developing targeted therapies, including antisense drugs, for correcting aberrant splicing associated with genetic diseases. His early research focused on purification and characterization of enzymes, including cellulases, transglutaminases, and RNA replicase from Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus. Working in the laboratory of Alan Lambowitz, he also analyzed how the maturase LtrA binds to the Ll.LtrB  Group II intron in Lactococcus lactis, facilitating cDNA synthesis and shedding light on its role in RNA splicing and its evolutionary origins.\nSingh delved into the functions of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein in RNA metabolism, linking its roles to SMA and various other conditions. Collaborating with Nirmal K. Singh, Natalia N. Singh and Elliot J. Androphy, he investigated the function of the intronic splicing silencer N1 (ISS-N1) in the SMN2 gene, its involvement in exon 7 skipping and its therapeutic potential for SMA, leading to the first medical therapy for the condition and earning patents. He also established that an 8-mer antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) corrects SMN2 exon 7 splicing aberrations in SMA models, increasing SMN levels with specificity and efficacy. Furthermore, he examined the C6U mutation, and exonic splicing enhancers in exon 7 of the SMN gene, shedding light on the regulation of splicing in SMA.\nSingh explored how RNA structure, specifically terminal stem loop 2 (TSL2), influences exon 7 splicing in the SMN genes, and identified TIA1 and TIAR proteins as positive regulators of SMN2 exon 7 splicing, revealing insights into SMA pathology. He developed a multi-exon skipping detection assay (MESDA) to capture multiple splice isoforms of SMN genes in a single experiment. He uncovered therapeutic significance of an RNA structure formed by a long-distance interaction within an intron, and demonstrated how a small ASO (8-mer ASO) could be used for therapeutic splicing correction in SMA. His research also revealed an association of male infertility with the low SMN levels in a mild mouse model of SMA, and showed how activation of a cryptic splice site could be exploited for the treatment of rare cases of SMA. In addition, he showcased novel sequence and structural motifs associated with RNA-SMN interactions, and discovered a huge repertoire of circular RNAs (circRNAs) generated by human SMN genes. In a paper published in Scientific Reports, he showed aberrant transcription of genes on chromosomes 4, 7, 10 and X upon overexpression of a circRNA encompassing four early exons of SMN genes. His research identified and characterized off-target effects of splicing modulating therapeutic compounds, including ASOs and small molecules, with his laboratory being the first to c",

    "Castle ruins in Saga, Japan\nObukumayama K\u014dgoishi (\u5e2f\u9688\u5c71\u795e\u7c60\u77f3) was an ancient Korean-style fortress located in the Kuboizumimachi neighborhood of Saga, Saga Prefecture, Japan. Its ruins have been protected as a National Historic Site since 1951.\nHistory\nAfter the defeat of the combined Baekje and Yamato Japan forces, at the hands of the Silla and Tang China alliance at the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663, the Yamato court feared an invasion from either or both Tang or Silla. In response, a huge network of shore fortifications was constructed throughout the rest of the 600s, often with the assistance of Baekje engineers, generals and artisans. Unaware of the outbreak of the Silla-Tang War (670\u2013676), the Japanese would continue to build fortifications until 701, even after finding out that Silla was no longer friendly with Tang. The name \"k\u014dgoishi\" means \"stones of divine protection,\" a name given them by the Meiji period archaeologist Tsuboi Sh\u014dgor\u014d, who conjectured that they served as spiritual or practical protection for sacred sites. Scholars after Tsuboi determined that the structures are most likely the remains of practical, military fortifications, and were unlikely to have significant spiritual connections, although much remains unknown about these structures and there is very little contemporary documentary evidence.\nObukumayama Castle is located around Mount Obikuma, 177.3 meters above sea level, south of the Sefuri mountain range, which runs from east to west, north of the Saga Plain. It was discovered in 1941. The fortifications span three valleys, with a total length of about 2,400 meters. The stone rows are made of cut granite stones about 60-centimeters high, and although there are missing portions, the line of the stone rows can be traced for the most part. There is a flat area in the north, and remains that are thought to be the remains of a gate. In the southwestern valley, there is a site that is thought to be a water gate.  \nArchaeological excavations were conducted in 1964, and  have revealed that the rows of stones are the foundations of an earthwork, with a 2-3 meter high earthwork built using tamped earth behind them and wooden fences erected at approximately 3 meter intervals on the flat area in front of the stone wall. No traces of buildings have been found within the enclosed area. \nThe site is approximately 18 minutes by car from Kanzaki Station on the JR Kyushu Nagasaki Main Line.\nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Saga)\nList of foreign-style castles in Japan\nK\u014dgoishi\nLiterature\nDe Lange, William (2021).

    "Occitan noble (1165\u20131214)\nBaldwin of Toulouse (1165 \u2013 1214) was the youngest son of Count Raymond V of Toulouse and Princess Constance of France.\nBiography\nBaldwin spent his youth at the French Court with his mother, after she had separated from his father. It was not until the death of his father in 1194 that he went to Toulouse. His brother Raymond VI received him badly, fearing having to share his father's inheritance, and went so far as to contest Baldwin's birth. But Baldwin's conciliatory nature won out, and he was granted Bruniquel as a fief, and made him guardian of his son in his will.\nIn 1211, Raymond entrusted him with the castle of Montferrand to defend against the army of Simon de Montfort who led the Albigensian Crusade. He repelled Simon's first attacks, despite small numbers, but realized that he would not succeed in resisting a long siege. He then negotiated with Simon, whom he recognized from court, and obtained the surrender of the castle in exchange for the lives of the inhabitants and freedom for the defenders. However, when he returned to Toulouse, his brother violently reproached him for having lost the castle and Baldwin decided to join the crusader army. Simon gave him custody of the castle of Saint-Antonin.\nBaldwin participated in several campaigns led by de Montfort, and particularly in the Battle of Muret in 1213. After the battle, he returned to his estate in Quercy. Two relatives of the Count of Toulouse took him prisoner in his castle of Lolmie, near Montcuq and delivered him to Raymond VI who was in Montauban. His brother had him hanged as a traitor in February 1214. The peace negotiated by Pope Innocent III prevented Simon de Montfort from avenging his death.\nFamily\nBaldwin had married Alix, daughter and heiress of Sicard V, Viscount de Lautrec and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de B\u00e9ziers.\nTraditionally, he was thought to be the progenitor of the extent House of Toulouse-Lautrec, however, recent DNA research has found that they are paternally descendants of the ninth century Counts of Albi.\n",
    "Demolished church in Devon, England\nSt Mark's Church was a Church of England church in Dawlish, Devon, England. It was built between 1849 and 1851 as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St Gregory. It closed as a place of worship in 1974 and was demolished in 1976. The site is now occupied by residential dwellings.\nHistory\nConstruction of St Mark's\nSt Mark's was built as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St Gregory, at a time when accommodation at the parish church had become inadequate to meet the needs of the growing town. The parish church was at an \"inconvenient distance\" for a good proportion of the town and it was also felt that the church did not have an adequate number of free sittings for the poorer inhabitants. Among the contributors to the building fund for the new church was the owner of Luscombe Castle, Charles Hoare, who contributed \u00a31,000, along with a further \u00a31,000 towards its endowment, and his wife, who gave a further \u00a31,000.\nThe plans for St Mark's were drawn up by the architect John Hayward of Exeter. It was made up of a nave, chancel and vestry, and had seated accommodation for 287 people, of which 197 seats were free and 90 were appropriated. A gallery level held 28 seats and the organ.\nThe foundation stone was laid by Hoare's newphew, Robert Blencowe, on 15 May 1849, and the completed church was consecrated by the Bishop of Exeter, the Right Rev. Henry Phillpotts, on 23 April 1851. The church's masonry work was carried out by Messrs. Spencer and Matthews, with Samuel Knight as the stonemason, and Mr. Parker was the painter, plumber and glazier.\nEnlargement and restoration\nFrom the time of its opening, St Mark's often saw full attendance during services, particularly on Sunday evenings. By October 1851, the Western Times reported that the church had been \"so well attended of late on Sunday evenings that sitting room has been unattainable by many\" and added the new place of worship is, \"as we have already said, far too small for the town\". In 1878, after the restoration of St Gregory's was completed, plans were made to enlarge St Mark's by adding a south aisle and a subscription list was started towards the work. The church was described as \"often very crowded during the season\" and particularly when poor weather prevented inhabitants from walking to the parish church. By May 1881, the fund had reached over \u00a3600 and an anonymous donation of \u00a3400 was received in June 1883.\nThe enlargement plans, which were drawn up by Messrs. Hayward and Son of Exeter in 1879, saw accommodation increase from 255 to 416 seats. The work was carried out in three phases and tenders for the first were sought in May 1883, for the excavation of a bank on the south side of the church and building a retaining wall and stove chamber. The tender of J. Hawkins of Dawlish was accepted that month for \u00a3182 and the heating arrangements were entrusted to Messrs. King and Munk of Exeter.\nThe second phase, involving the construction of a new aisle and the reseating of the nave, was approved in October 1883 and the tender of J. G. Stephens of Exeter, at \u00a3943, was accepted the following month. The new 19 foot wide aisle was completed in July 1884 and, after a period of further fundraising, tenders for the third phase of work were sought in April 1885. This included the construction of an organ chamber on the south side of the chancel, a new vestry, and adding choir stalls on the north side of the chancel. The tender of J. C. Stephens of Exeter was accepted for \u00a3305.\nSt Mark's was formally reopened on 7 October 1885. In addition to the three phases of work, the church received a new organ, built by Messrs. Hele & Co. of Plymouth, from Mrs. Norsworthy of Newlands. A new stone pulpit was gifted by the family of the late Mrs. Somerset in her memory in December 1885.\nClosure and demolition\nIn 1969, the Church Council, concerned over the parish's financial position, recommended closing St Mark's in a bid to save money, but it was vetoed by the vicar, Rev. John Delve. St Mark's was declared redundant by the Church of England on 6 September 1974 and the Church Commissioners approved its demolition on 12 February 1975.\nThe demolition of the church was originally due to be carried out in September 1975, but the Church Commissioners postponed their plans due to local pressure. Some called for it to be retained for the benefit of the community, potentially as a community centre, youth club or sports hall, and concerns were also raised about the negative impact demolition would have on the conservation area. A local store owner, Alan Evans, gained over 1,000 signatures for his petition calling for the church to be saved.\nThe Redundant Churches Committee of the Church Commissioners held further meetings to discuss the matter, but ultimately the decision was made to continue as planned and St Mark's was demolished in early 1976. The site was subsequently sold to a private owner and redeveloped with the construction of six dwel",
    "Jewish council member in Hungary\nMikl\u00f3s Szeg\u0151 (born Menachem Sch\u00fctzer; 1884 \u2013 4 or 6 January 1945) was a Hungarian Jewish jurist during the World War II. Following the German invasion of Hungary, he took part in organizing Jewish councils in Central Hungary. As a member of the Jewish Council of Budapest at the last stage of the war, he was arrested and executed by Arrow Cross Party militia in the midst of the siege of Budapest.\nProfessional career\nMikl\u00f3s Szeg\u0151 was born as Menachem Sch\u00fctzer in 1884 in M\u00f3r, Fej\u00e9r County, as the son of Jakab Sch\u00fctzer and R\u00f3za Gr\u00fcnfeld. Other sources place his birth year at 1887. He had a brother B\u00e9la, a wealthy soap maker. He obtained a law degree in Budapest. He opened his law firm in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in 1910. He was a member of the bar association and its board until 1937. Among others, he was a legal representative of far-right politicians S\u00e1ndor Festetics and Domonkos Festetics. Simultaneously, he also became a member of a legislative authority of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and the directorate of the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and Fej\u00e9r County Savings Bank. He was involved in the Israelite Hungarian Literary Society too. He served as vice president of the Neolog Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Israelite Congregation from 1929, then he presided the community from 1939. Szeg\u0151 and his wife R\u00f3za Bernstein supported Zionism in their residence.\nIn the 1930s, he farmed his 12,000-acre estate in Fej\u00e9r and Veszpr\u00e9m counties. By 1942, his estate became the largest milk supplier to Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. However, the anti-Semitic provisions hindered its operation. For instance, in 1939, he was fined 2,400 peng\u0151s for employing more than the permitted number of Jews on his estates.\nDuring the Holocaust\nThe Nazi Germany invaded Hungary on 19 March 1944. They immediately established the Central Jewish Council seated in Budapest. Szeg\u0151 was among those rural Jewish leaders, who attended the first official meeting of the council on 28 March, after granting domestic travel permit from the German administration. Jewish councils were created throughout the country in the following weeks. Szeg\u0151, as head of the local Neolog community, automatically was installed as president of the Jewish Council of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, despite that he allegedly stated that \"leading a Jewish council is synonymous with death. If you obey the Germans, you might survive, but the Jews will be killed by the end of the war. But if you follow your Jewish sense of self, the Nazis will kill you\". Furthermore, Szeg\u0151, leading a regional Jewish council also headquartered in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, was mandated to abolish the religious communities throughout the region, in Fej\u00e9r and Veszpr\u00e9m counties. In their places, Szeg\u0151 organized and installed Jewish councils with the mandate given by SS officials, for instance, in Bicske, Felcs\u00fat, Gy\u0151rszentm\u00e1rton, S\u00e1rbog\u00e1rd, S\u00e1rkereszt\u00far and Szabadh\u00eddv\u00e9g.\nSzeg\u0151 was taken into custody sometime before 12 April 1944 by Gestapo. He was incarcerated in a detention house in Budapest. He was held in captivity still on 7 May. He was released in the next days, he took over his tasks again on 12 May. Shortly after, he was again arrested and was lying in the prisoners' hospital on Mosonyi Street. Together with his community, Szeg\u0151 was interned to the collection camp of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r before their deportation. However, Szeg\u0151 and his family, as noted Zionists, were freed and transported to Budapest as part of the Kastner operation on 14 June 1944. Thereafter, Szeg\u0151 found refuge at Glass House. Following the Arrow Cross Party coup on 16 October 1944, Szeg\u0151 was appointed a member of the Central Jewish Council and in this capacity, he was active in the Budapest Ghetto amidst the siege of Budapest in December 1944. He mainly dealt with matters of food, medicine and cleanliness. He intended to establish patient rooms per house, organized childcare and epidemic hospital, but there was no time or opportunity for that. Szeg\u0151 was abducted and murdered by Arrow Cross Party militia on 4 or 6 January 1945, few days before the Soviets liberated the Budapest Ghetto.\n",

    "Television station in Federal District, Brazil\nRecord Bras\u00edlia (channel 8) is a Brazilian television station based in Bras\u00edlia, Federal District carrying Record for the Brazilian capital area and its surroundings. Owned-and-operated by Grupo Record, its studios are in the Record Building, located in the Southern Radio and Television Sector (SRTVS), in the South Wing of Plano Piloto, and its transmitters are in the Digital TV Tower of Bras\u00edlia, in the administrative region of Lago Norte.\nHistory\nTV Alvorada (1960-1980)\nWhile Bras\u00edlia was being built, the Federal Government opened bidding for three channels, one for the federal government itself, one for Di\u00e1rios Associados and another for Emissoras Unidas. Channel 8 VHF in the federal capital, originally called TV Alvorada, was inaugurated together with the city's other two pioneering stations, TV Nacional and TV Bras\u00edlia, on April 21, 1960, at the founding of the city. The masters of ceremonies for the inauguration of TV Alvorada were Ded\u00e9 Santana and Ana Rosa.\nOwned by Rede das Emissoras Unidas, TV Alvorada operated precariously in an apartment on the 6th floor of Super Quadra 104, and its studios, located in one of the boxes of the Bras\u00edlia TV Tower, were only ready in 1965. At the beginning of 1967, journalist Wolney Milhomem, who presented Roda Viva on TV Bras\u00edlia, was hired to present the journalistic Debate em Linha Reta.\nIn 1967, the station began carrying TV Excelsior programming, given the brief dismantling of the network led by Pipa Amaral and Paulo Machado de Carvalho, which would resurface in 1969 as Rede de Emissoras Independentes, of which the broadcaster soon became an affiliate. In 1972, Pipa divested his communications business to live outside the country, selling TV Alvorada and its sister TV Rio to the Order of Capuchin Minor Friars, controller of TV Difusora in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul.\nOn September 7 of the same year, TV Alvorada changed its name to TV Rio Bras\u00edlia, adopting the same name as the Rio station. OFM's plans were to transform the acquired stations into a new national network, with the production center led from Porto Alegre, however, the strategy did not go ahead. On January 16, 1976, DENTEL technicians sealed the transmitters and studios of TV Rio de Bras\u00edlia, after months of delayed salaries for its employees, a situation that would be repeated a year later with the Rio de Janeiro station.\nIn 1978, the station's assets were sold to Grupo Brasilino, which reactivated it as TV Itamaraty, and the following year, TV Regional. The new owners decided to air independent programming, focused on series, films and cartoons, but in July 1980, Grupo Brasilino went bankrupt and channel 8 went off the air again.\nTV Capital (1981-1993)\nAfter a year off the air, channel 8 was reactivated on August 26, 1981, as TV Capital, on the initiative of Rede Capital de Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es, by businessmen Edevaldo Alves da Silva and Arnold Fioravante. Its daily programming in the first few months went on air at 10 am, then began airing at 4:30 pm and ended at midnight. Between 1981 and 1985, the broadcaster retransmitted TVE Rio de Janeiro programs.\nIn 1985, the station considered broadcasting SBT programming, which had left TV Bras\u00edlia, but negotiations did not progress and the channel then retransmitted Abril V\u00eddeo programs until it went off the air in November. In 1986, he returned after years to retransmit part of TV Record's programming.\nIn 1988, it began rebroadcasting TV Gazeta's programming, showing attractions such as Mulheres em Parade, presented by Ione Borges and Claudete Troiano, the talk show Paulista 900, the economic newsletter Dinheiro Vivo with Lu\u00eds Nassif and the debate program Vamos Sair da Crise with Alexandre Machado, in which TV Capital often participated. In August 1989, the broadcaster returned to showing programs produced by TV Record, such as Record em Not\u00edcias and Jornal da Record, in addition to the attractions of TV Gazeta, a situation that continued until the formation of Rede Record the following year, after the purchase by businessman and religious leader Edir Macedo.\nAs a Record O&O (since 1993)\nIn 1991, with the beginning of Rede Record's expansion, TV Capital was one of the first stations to be acquired by Grupo Record, in a transaction that also involved R\u00e1dio Capital. After the purchase, the station changed its name, becoming TV Record Bras\u00edlia on March 18, 1993. In the same year, the television news program Informe Bras\u00edlia debuted, which in 2003 was renamed Informe DF. In 1997, the station opened its own headquarters in the South Radio and Television Sector, leaving the obsolete facilities of the TV Tower.\nOn April 3, 2006, the DF Record news program debuted, adopting the new standard brand for Record's local news programs. On January 15, 2007, the local version of Balan\u00e7o Geral premiered, presented by Henrique Chaves, replacing Fala Bras\u00edlia. On February 18, 2008, the station was renamed TV Record Centro-Oeste.",

    "\nDaughters of Mary Immaculate is a Chaldean Catholic apostolic order with patriarchal rights, established in Baghdad on August 7, 1922, during the reign of Patriarch Mar Youssef Emmanuel II Thomas.\nChaldean Sisters was founded by Father Anton Zebouni, born on January 17, 1883, in Mosul, Iraq. Zebouni was ordained a priest on May 15, 1907, by Patriarch Emmanuel II Toma. In the aftermath of World War I, many in Iraq faced poverty and hardship. Father Zebouni, moved by the difficult conditions, sought to create a congregation for women to support the Chaldean community. With permission from the Patriarch, the congregation was established and dedicated to Mary Immaculate.\nThe order's mission includes a life of contemplative unity with God. The sisters engage in apostolic work and prayer, seeking to discover and follow God's will for the salvation of souls.\nHistory\nThe Chaldean Sisters initially aimed to address the crisis of homeless Chaldean youth. In 1927, they founded an orphanage in Baghdad, which was later relocated due to security issues. The orphanage eventually settled in Alqosh. Over the years, the congregation has grown to nearly 100 sisters serving in various locations, including Iraq, Lebanon, Rome, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Detroit, Chicago, Arizona, Turlock, and San Diego.\nThe Chaldean Sisters have been instrumental in various educational and social services, including running schools, orphanages, and retirement homes.

    "Earthquake in Iran\nThe 1923 Torbat-e Heydarieh earthquake occurred in Razavi Khorasan province, Iran on 25 May. The Mw\u202f 6.0 earthquake, which had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe), completely levelled the village of Quzan. The earthquake killed an estimated 2,200 people.\nEarthquake\nThe earthquake's damaging effects were felt south of the city of Torbat-e Heydarieh, though the town and its residents were unharmed. It's epicenter is located about 8\u00a0km (5.0\u00a0mi) southwest of the town and south of the Doruneh Fault zone. Its surface-wave magnitude was 5.8 based on some observatory readings from Europe. The epicenter was determined based on the effects observed to be near Kaj Darakht. Some earthquake catalogs assigned epicenter locations with large error margins up to 524\u00a0km (326\u00a0mi) away from the macroseismic epicenter; in Herat, Balochistan and the Dasht-e Lut. Its location is within a seismically active zone that stretches from Nishapur to Sisan-e Qadim along a junction between the Lut Block and the flysch belt. This strip of area intersects the 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) east-west striking Doruneh Fault zone that stretches from Khwaf to the Dasht-e Kavir. Though low-magnitude earthquakes are common, large events such as those in 1336 and 1619, are rare.\nThe Doruneh Fault zone is one of the longest and most geologically prominent faults in Iran. It is a sinistral strike-slip fault with an annual slip rate of 2.5\u00a0mm (0.098\u00a0in). No large earthquakes has been associated with the fault in historical times although the 1923 event, moderate in magnitude, is a possible candidate. Large earthquakes are thought to occur along the fault every 2,000 years.\nBased on its macroseismic effects, the meizoseismal area was probably no larger than 60\u00a0km2 (23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and had a radius no further than 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi). The Modified Mercalli intensity in the area was evaluated at VIII (Severe) based on reports of people and animals being tossed to the floor. There were no surface ruptures observed along the Doruneh Fault zone though limited land slumping occurred near channels and qanats which were not tectonic in origin. Modified Mercalli intensities no greater than VI (Strong) followed along a predominantly easternly trend from the epicenter and covered a 1,000\u00a0km2 (390\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) area.\nDamage\nDespite the relatively small magnitude, its epicenter in a densely populated region with many small and scattered villages made it destructive. The area with the greatest damage and assigned VIII (Severe) encompassed the settlements of Kaj Darakht, Quzan, Khurgh Mortazavieh; abandoned sites such as Chah-i Jauzaq, Qalandarabad, Aliabad, Taqiabad, Hasanabad, Hassanshab; and several farms.\nA doctor from the American Mission in Mashad said these reports were inflated, claiming the death toll did not exceed 1,000. About five villages were totally razed, 20 partially affected and only 30 deaths in Torbat-e Heydarieh. About 770 people died within this area while 90 people died in the surrounding region. Officials counted a total of 2,219 dead and 170 injured. Ambraseys and Moinfar only recorded about 900 fatalities.\nIn Quzan, which was razed, lost residents and many of its livestock. The town was reconstructed over several years as the village's qanats continued supplying sufficient water despite its reduced capacity after the earthquake. In Kaj Darakht, 60 people died and the town was almost levelled. Several people died in Chah-i Jauzaq, a remote farm to the west\u2013northwest. In Khurg, 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) east of Quzan, about half of the 220 residents died. To the south, in Taqiabad, a village of 120 people, half the population was killed. In Mortazavieh, the village's mujtahid was among the 180 that died.\nTwo hundred and thirty homes were damaged in city of Torbat-e Heydarieh which housed 10,000 inhabitants. Reports of damage in the city were highly exaggerated to sensationalise the event and raise greater concern. About 25 or fewer homes of the adobe kind and badly constructed, were destroyed, and only seven or eight people died in the city. In Buriabad, 15 people died and 50 of its 120 dwellings were damaged. Water flow in the village qanats may have increased following the shock. Damage covered a wide area which stretched 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) east of Torbat-e Heydarieh but was considered minor; few homes collapsed, killing some people in Guji and Malekabad. Damage also occurred in other villages with limited or no fatalities. In Shadmehr, few homes were ruined while 50 others were near total-losses; about 15 people died.\nAftermath\nSeparate boards were formed to handle the injured, sustinance for survivors and burial; crop cultivation and irrigation; and claims for dead people's will and property losses. The Governor-General of Mashad requested the Tehran treasury to provide 100,000 tumans for reconstruction efforts. A public assembly of the Majlis to discuss the grant petition opened on 9 June 1923 with Ahmad Shah Qajar being involved. Many villagers bel",

In 1933, he obtained a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Marburg while also being ordained as a rabbi. After moving to England, he accepted a rabbinic post at the Finchley Synagogue. In 1938, he immigrated to Australia to become the senior rabbi at the Great Synagogue in Sydney, a position he held for over three decades. During his tenure as rabbi, Porush played a key role in uniting the Australian Jewish community, bridging the gap between the established Jewish community and the influx of newcomers arriving after World War II. He was involved in interfaith work through the NSW Council of Christians and Jews. He was also instrumental in the founding of Jewish day schools in Australia.

    "United States historic place\nThe Mount Vernon Site, also known as the GE Mound, is a Hopewell site near Mount Vernon in southwest Indiana. The site was discovered and mostly destroyed in 1988 during road construction at a General Electric plastic manufacturing facility. The mound was partially leveled, used for road fill, and subject to widespread looting shortly after its discovery, resulting in a contentious and precedent-setting prosecution under the Archeological Resources Protection Act. It was one of the five largest recorded Hopewell mounds before its destruction. The depth and breadth of artifacts recovered from the site are some of the most significant of all Hopewell sites and even in its degraded condition it is one of the most significant Hopewell mounds yet discovered.\nCharacteristics\nBefore its destruction, the mound was loaf-shaped and measured 125\u00a0m (410\u00a0ft) long,  50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft) wide, and 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft), with evidence of potential structures or tombs within the body of the mound. This large size makes it one of the five largest known Hopewell mounds. The mound is located near the confluence of the Ohio and Wabash rivers near another large-scale Hopewell site, the Mann site. The mound was used as a ceremonial and burial site, most likely by the Mann phase of the Crab Orchard Culture.\nA great number of artifacts were discovered inside the mound, with both the quantity and quality unmatched by few other Hopewell sites. The thousands of chert bifaces, dozens of quartz and obsidian blades, copper celts, silver ear spools, and bear teeth are common at Hopewell sites but have rarely been found in such numbers. Rarer artifacts include panpipes, carved coal ornaments and worked human and animal bones. Particularly notable are intact organic artifacts including fragments of cloth and decorated leather ornaments which have rarely survived due to their fragile organic nature.\nSome of these artifacts traveled a great deal, with the copper and silver originating in Keweenaw Peninsula in northern Michigan and the obsidian coming all the way from Obsidian Cliff in Wyoming. Pearls produced in the area have been found at both Mount Vernon and Ohio Hopewell sites, potentially indicating trade connections between Mount Vernon and the wider prehistoric-United States.\nDiscovery and Looting\nPreliminary surveys prior to a 1988 highway extension project identified the feature as a natural hill to be used for road fill. During planned work between April and June 1988, artifacts were discovered as the mound was being leveled. After highway work had finished, local collectors were made aware of this and descended upon the site - looting thousands of artifacts from what was left of the mound without informing the landowner, General Electric, or state authorities as required by state law. Indiana Department of Highways archeologists learned of the site in October of that year after an anonymous tip, and began work to salvage what was left of the mound.\nTrial and Controversy\nMedia coverage brought public outrage and attention to the site. Multiple parties including General Electric, Federal and State government and Native American tribes had significant cause for outrage. In a then-novel case, the FBI began investigating and brought charges against five looters under the 1979 Archeological Resources Protection Act. As part of a plea deal, the looters returned any unsold artifacts and described the unaltered condition of the mound to archeologists. Fines and jail time were leveled on the looters, and the case helped to establish the legitimacy of federal protections on archeological sites. The trial exacerbated existing stresses between archeologists, native groups and amateur archeologists.\nThe artifacts were reburied in 1994 without proper scientific study at the insistence of out-of-state Native American groups. The marginalization of local Indian group wishes and the loss of rare and significant artifacts caused a second round of controversy.\nToday the mound is mostly destroyed and the remnants lie on well protected private property - currently owned by SABIC.\nSee Also\nMann Site - Related large Hopewell mound complex located several miles up the Ohio River\n",
    "\n2024 studio album by Rosie Tucker\nI was going for humor to hang on my anger and bitterness, and I think a lot of this record was about trying to recognize that bitterness can be internally caustic if you hold onto it and try to figure out how to excise that. \u201cLightbulb,\u201d for me, synthesizes a lot of what I was thinking about during this record. It deals with technology, as I literally had a pack of lightbulbs that were color changing and the app on my phone wanted the permission to be able to read my text messages and that freaked me out, and I related the paranoia of this to how a whole generation of people are caught in this space where we\u2019ve grown up in a situation where we cannot separate what we love to do from a very mechanized relationship with metrics \u2013 play versus economics.\n\u2014Rosie Tucker on lyrical themses in Utopia Now!\nUtopia Now! is a 2024 studio album by American singer-songwriter Rosie Tucker. It has received positive reviews from critics.\nReception\nWriting at BrooklynVegan, Amanda Hatfield praised the anti-capitalist lyrics on this release and stated that \"it\u2019s a satisfying followup to  Sucker Supreme without straying too far from what made that album so appealing\". Avery Gregurich of PopMatters rated Utopia Now! an 8 out of 10, calling it \"an alchemistic mix of post-pandemic mall punk and dream pop\"  where \"Tucker turns ironic ennui and allegory into truly enchanting pop songs\". In Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield characterized this release as \"definitely a portrait of North America in our moment, set in a culture where non-sponsored fun is just a rumor, where your phone is spying on you, where every small-time artist has to turn into a full-time huckster just to keep making their art\" and compared the music to Juliana Hatfield, Minutemen, and that dog. On June\u00a04, writers at Stereogum did a roundup of the best albums of the year so far and ranked this 32, with James Rettig stating \"Tucker\u2019s songs are sarcastic and wry and unbelievably catchy\". Nate Sloan of Vulture called this release \"something of a fresh start\" and \"a distinctly different artistic approach\" for Tucker.\nTrack listing\nALl songs written by Rosie Tucker, except where noted\n\"Lightbulb\"\u00a0\u2013 2:46\n\"All My Exes Live in Vortexes\"\u00a0\u2013 2:30\n\"Gil Scott Albatross\"\u00a0\u2013 2:37\n\"Paperclip Maximizer\"\u00a0\u2013 3:24\n\"Maylene\"\u00a0\u2013 3:15\n\"Big Fish/No Fun\"\u00a0\u2013 3:23\n\"Suffer!

    "\nMixed Use in Araneta City, Quezon City\nThe Aurora Tower is a 22-storey mixed-use, high-rise tower located along Aurora Boulevard, in the Araneta City complex in Quezon City. The tower serves as the former headquarters of the Araneta Group and also houses Isetann Department Store and Supermarket within the tower's retail and underground sections.\nLocation\nThe Aurora Tower is located in the northern area of the Araneta City and sits along Aurora Boulevard, and is also situated along General Malvar and General Aguinaldo Avenues. The tower is located beside the Manhattan Parkway of the Manhattan Gardens complex and is also across the New Frontier Theater. The tower is also close to the Gateway Office Building, the Gateway Malls 1 and 2, and the Araneta Center-Cubao LRT Station.\nBackground\nThe Aurora Tower began construction in the early 1980s and was eventually completed in 1984. The tower was developed by the Araneta Group and later served as the headquarters of the Araneta Group and its subsidiaries after moving from the Do\u00f1a Consolacion Building. The Araneta Group remained as the tower's main tenant until 2014, as the company moved its headquarters to the nearby Gateway Tower. The tower also features retail spaces in the lower ground and first five floors, office spaces, penthouse units, and a helipad.\nIn 1985, the tower's retail and lower ground spaces were occupied by Isetann Department Store and Supermarket, wherein Isetann Department Store occupies the tower's first five upper floors, while the Isetann Supermarket occupies the tower's lower ground spaces.\nIn 2006, the Aurora Tower was certified as a Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) certified information technology (IT) building following under Proclamation no. 985 of former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The tower is also occupied by the offices of the Honorary Consulate of Colombia; Binibining Pilipinas, which occupies the 8th floor of the tower, while keeping its headquarters at the Gateway Tower, and other local firms. The tower also housed the Embassy of Colombia, until the Embassy later moved to a new location at the Inoza Tower in the Bonifacio Global City.\n",

    "\n4C +41.17 is a radio galaxy located in the constellation Auriga. With the redshift of 3.79, it is located nearly 11.7\u00a0billion light-years from Earth. At the time of its discovery in 1988, it was one of the most distant galaxies ever seen.\nCharacteristics\nHubble Space Telescope image of 4C +41.17\n4C +41.17 is classified as one of the largest radio galaxies in the early universe with emission at Ks spread nonuniformly over a 3 \u00d7 6 (42 \u00d7 84 kpc) area. A potentiator of a massive elliptical galaxy located in the center of low-redshift galaxy cluster, it hosts a powerful radio source with a high-powered (1046 ergs s-1) astrophysical jet that is producing shock-excited emission-line nebulosity through its 1000 km s-1 shocks. With a C IV luminosity emanating from the shock, this implies the preshock density in the line-emitting cloud is high as it contains a hydrogen density of\u00a0110 cm-3. This causes shock-initiated star formation proceeding on a timescale (a few \u00d7 106 yr) within estimated dynamical age (3 \u00d7 107 yr) of the radio source.\n4C +41.17 is a hyperluminous infrared galaxy, with a star formation rate of >103 Msolar yr-1, making it a strong candidate for being a primeval galaxy, in the process of a major episode of star formation. With radio luminosity of L500\u2009MHz > 1027 W Hz\u22121, 4C +41.17 is an extremely rare object that has a number density of \u223c10\u22128 Mpc\u22123 in the redshift range 2 < z < 5.\nWith characteristics like having a steep radio spectrum of (\u03b1 \u223c \u22121.3) together with an extended optical continuum emission and large rest frame Ly\u03b1 equivalent width of \u223c270 \u00c5, this identifies 4C+41.17 as a high redshift radio galaxy. It has a high infrared luminosity of LFIR \u223c 1013\u2009L\u2299 with large dust mass located in the dust lane in the center of the galaxy and molecular gas reservoir, making it a site of star production.\nObservations of 4C +41.17\nFrom the interferometer used at IRAM 30m telescope in Spain, researchers detected two carbon oxide (CO) systems in 4C +41.17. These systems are measured by M_dyn \u223c 6 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 which is separated by 1\\farcs8 (13 kpc), and 400\\kms in velocity. The carbon oxide systems then coincide with two different dark lanes in a deep Lya image. One of the CO component is found to coincide with the cm-radio core of 4C +41.17, with a close redshift to the \\HeII AGN line. The second component is located near the base of a cone-shaped region  that is southwest of the nucleus, resembling emission-line cones seen in nearby active galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies. The characteristics of the CO sources and their mm/submm dust continuum are similar to those found in ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in some high-z radio galaxies and quasars. The fact that 4C 41.17 contains two CO systems is a sign that it might have gone a merger with another galaxy.\nThere is also a strong presence of strong X-ray emission originating from a point source that is coincident with the nucleus. According to researchers, an extended X-ray emission is found having a luminosity of ~1045 ergs s-1. The emission covers 100 kpc (15'') diameter region which it surrounds the radio galaxy, and follows the general distribution pattern of radio emission in the radio lobes of this source and the giant Ly\u03b1 emission-line halo distribution. However, the spectrum of the X-ray emission on the other hand, is nonthermal with a power-law index consistent to a radio synchrotron. This signifies the X-ray emission is most likely an inverse Compton scattering of photons that are far-infrared from a relativistic electron population associate with past and current activity from the central object.\n4C +41.17 was also observed by Herschel, which about 65% of the extracted sources at 70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 micron, are identified as mid-infrared sources that were observed through Spitzer Space Telescope at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 and 24 micron. From these observations, the Herschel sources are mostly foreground towards radio galaxy and therefore not belong to any structure associated with the galaxy.\nHubble Space Telescope did observe 4C +41.17 through detections using good signal-to-noise ratio with a spatially resolution of 0.1\" (440 pc); this suggests 35% of this emission ends up in the form of a high brightness clumpy regions extending by about 0.5\" (1.7 kpc). This morphology is remarkably similar to that of the radio components. A fainter diffuse region of optical emission is seen extending westward from the center of the nuclear complex about 1.2\" (5.3 kpc) out along the radio axis, indicating the emission of stellar origin with an estimated mass of about 10^10^M_sun_ of stars in each <= 500 pc clump.\nStar formation rate of 4C +41.17\nDeep spectropolarimetric observations via the W. M. Keck Telescope conducted by researchers in Hawaii, finds out that 4C +41.17 is unpolarized between \u028e rest ~\u00a01400 \u00c52000 \u00c5. This indicates scattered light has no dominance over the aligned ultraviolet continuum. Instead, they found that 4C +41.17 show absorption line",
    "Defunct nightclub in California (1946\u20131953)\nThe Toddle House was a night club that operated from approximately 1946 until 1953 in Culver City, California, United States. It featured live music, steak dinners, and what would now be called strippers. The club was allegedly used for prostitution and as a hangout for racketeers. Shortly after the club's liquor license was suspended by the state and operating permit was revoked by the city, the building was gutted by two fires that broke out in different locations within the structure on the same morning.\nHistory\nThe club opened in approximately 1946. Advertisements placed in the Venice Vanguard in 1946 announced that steak dinners were served from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., that there was no cover charge, and that Haven Johnson \"with his funny songs\" would be playing piano as part of the \"continuous entertainment\". In 1951 consumers reported issues with larceny and assault at the Toddle House. Fortnight magazine interviewed Johnny Toscano for an 1951 article entitled \"The Los Angeles Bump & Grind Industry - How Wicked Is Burlesque? - Is it Really Harming Anyone?\" An advertorial column in the Vanguard in 1952 described Girls A-Poppin as a floor show with a comedian and a \"bevy of beauties who really keep things poppin'\". In addition to a \"variety of potent cocktails\" served at the \"mirrored bar,\" the Toddle House offered its patrons \"lots of convenient free parking\".\nDisplay ad placed in Daily News, March 3, 1952\nIn August 1953, a series of articles in the Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News suggested that the club was a hangout for bookmakers, racketeers, and pimps, namely Sam Lazes, Jimmy Fratianno, Jimmy Utley, and Sam Farkas, and was co-owned by Phil Tapper, described as a \"gambler and bookmaker,\" and Johnny Toscano, who had a burglary conviction in New York. Moreover, the Daily News suggested that illegal activities at the club were being overlooked by the Culver City Police Department in exchange for payoffs. It was suggested that a city ballot measure designed to increase pay rates for municipal police officers (and thus diminish their need for outside income) was being opposed by some Culver City employees in order to maintain the status quo. The measure passed, after which a Culver City police source told the Daily News that the \"biggest crime dodge In Culver City was bookmaking, a line of endeavor which evidently met the approval of some higher-ups. There are no brothels in the town...but the age-old profession of prostitution flourishes on a call-girl set-up in one of the notorious dives. 'If you're one of the boys,' he said, 'you just call and reserve a table for $25 or maybe even $150 and get fixed up'.\" Shortly thereafter the club's liquor license was suspended, shuttering the club for 15 days, for being what state and city officials described as a site of \"lewd and lascivious entertainment and...hangout for undesirable individuals including prostitutes and solicitors for unlawful activities\".\nOn December 15, 1953, the Culver City City Council revoked the club's permits to operate in the city, and Tapper and Toscano agreed in writing to vacate the premises within 60 days. On December 30, 1953, a fire broke out in the building at 4:15\u00a0a.m. and was extinguished by the Culver City Fire Department. A second fire broke out at 6\u00a0a.m. in a totally different part of the building and ultimately gutted the structure, despite a three-hour effort to extinguish it. Police were not able to apprehend or question a man who appeared to be lurking at the scene, interested in the work of the firefighters. The cause of the first fire was determined to be lit cigarettes deposited in full wastebasket. According to the official report, the second fire was the result of an electrical short circuit and \"started in the southeast part of the cocktail barroom near the ceiling, spreading to the ceiling and to the dining room. From the intense heat, the fire gradually worked itself down, but did not reach the floor level\". No connection was drawn between the two fires.\n",
    "2025 video game\nEternal Strands is an upcoming action-adventure video game developed and published by Yellow Brick Games. The game is set to be released for Windows PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S in 2025.\nGameplay\nEternal Strands is an action-adventure video game played from a third-person perspective. In the game, the player assumes control of Brynn, a warrior who is on a quest to search for the secrets of a long-lost civilization known as the Enclave. The player has the ability to manipulate elements and temperature using a magical cloak. Freezing enemies can slow them down, while burning them cost them health. The player's manipulation of temperature will also alter the game's world. Frequent usage of fire abilities will cause an area to become arid, and may result in fires that can spread rapidly in the game's vegetation. Brynn also has access to telekinetic powers, allowing her to perform feats such as hurling objects at enemies. These magical abilities can also be used for exploration. Brynn can construct bridges using ice, burn obstacles, or use telekinetic skills to launch herself across great distance. Brynn can also climb any surface found in the game's world.\nAs player progresses, they will encounter nine distinct boss that roams in different parts of the game's world. Players are often required to fight these boss while climbing on them in order to strike their weak points. Once a boss is defeated, players will be rewarded with a new magical ability that can be used for exploration or combat.\nDevelopment\nYellow Brick Games was founded in early 2020 by Mike Laidlaw and several other developers from Ubisoft, in particular its Quebec studio. Shadow of the Colossus, Dragon's Dogma, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom were important inspirations for gameplay, while European visual novels influenced the game's art style. With its physic-based combat system, the studio aimed to make players feel like they are a \"fantasy superhero\" while playing the game. The game was created with Unreal Engine 5, and the team had about 68 people.\nYellow Brick Games partnered with Private Division to publish the game in 2022, though it was revelaed in March 2024 that the studio will self-publish the title. The game was officially announced in April 2024, and is currently set to be released for Windows PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and Series S in 2025.\n",

    "Military unit\nThe 171st Rifle Division was originally formed as an infantry division of the Red Army in the North Caucasus Military District on September 18, 1939, based on the shtat (table of organization and equipment) of that same month. It was in the Kharkov Military District at the time of the German invasion, and it was soon moved to the northwest of Kyiv as part of Southwestern Front. It would remain defending the Ukrainian capital into September, eventually as part of 37th Army, when it was deeply encircled and destroyed.\nA new 171st was designated in January 1942, based on a 400-series division that had begun forming the previous month in the Ural Military District. After several months to complete formation and training the division was railed to Northwestern Front where it joined 34th Army near Demyansk. Over the next ten months it mostly held the line containing the German forces in the pocket around that town, occasionally participating in unsuccessful attacks against well-prepared defenses. In February 1943 the 171st was moved to 27th Army in the same Front just as Army Group North was evacuating the salient, but returned to 34th Army in April. During the summer and early autumn it fought local actions along the Lovat River, briefly as part of 1st Shock Army, before being moved west to 2nd Baltic Front in November, joining 79th Rifle Corps in 3rd Shock Army, where it would remain for the duration. After spending the winter and spring of 1944 deep in the Nevel salient, in July it took part in the Pskov-Ostrov Offensive and quickly won a battle honor for its role in the liberation of Idritsa. Shortly after it was also awarded the Order of the Red Banner after the fall of the Latvian city of R\u0113zekne. It continued to advance through Latvia into November, but was then redeployed with the rest of 3rd Shock to 1st Belorussian Front east of Warsaw. During the winter offensive into Poland the Army was initially in reserve but moved into the line in order to close the gap that had developed between 1st and 2nd Belorussian Fronts in East Pomerania. During this operation two of the 171st's regiments received awards. After it concluded 3rd Shock was reinforced and redeployed into the bridgehead over the Oder River at K\u00fcstrin just prior to the Berlin offensive.\n1st Formation\nThe division first began forming on September 18, 1939, in the North Caucasus Military District, based on a cadre from the 38th Rifle Division. Its order of battle on June 22, 1941, was as follows:\n380th Rifle Regiment\n525th Rifle Regiment\n713th Rifle Regiment\n357th Light Artillery Regiment\n478th Howitzer Artillery Regiment\n121st Antiaircraft Battalion\n131st Reconnaissance Battalion\n120th Sapper Battalion\n140th Signal Battalion\n119th Medical/Sanitation Battalion\n183rd Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Platoon\n138th Motor Transport Battalion\n114th Field Bakery\n205th Field Postal Station\n222nd Field Office of the State Bank\nKombrig Aleksandr Efimovich Budykho had been appointed to command the new division on August 19, even before it began forming. This officer had been serving as assistant commander of the 38th Division since the previous October and his rank would be modernized to major general on June 5, 1940. He would remain in command of the first formation for its entire existence.\nAt the start of the German invasion the 171st was part of 34th Rifle Corps in 19th Army, but as it moved toward the front it came under direct command of Southwestern Front by the start of July, and by July 10 it was in the rebuilding 27th Rifle Corps of the same Front, along with the 28th Mountain Rifle Division.\nDefense of Kyiv\nThe 13th and 14th Panzer Divisions reached the Irpin River west of Kyiv on July 11 after breaking through Southwestern Front near Zhytomyr. The German command was divided on plans to directly attack Kyiv to seize its crossings over the Dniepr River, but by July 13 German reconnaissance made it clear that Soviet fortifications and troop concentrations ruled out any possibility of taking the city by surprise. Kyiv would remain in Soviet hands for more than two further months. At about the same time the 27th Corps, after concentrating in the Yasnohorodka area, moved into positions along a line west of Irpin, with the 171st on the east and the 28th further west. The two divisions entered combat with German infantry and tanks on July 16 along a sector from Nalivaykovka to Makarov, which continued for several days.\nOn July 24 the 171st, along with units of the Kiev Fortified Region, foiled a German attack by elements of XXIX Army Corps of German 6th Army and took up positions on the line Zabuyanye\u2013Gole\u2013Druzhnya\u2013Borodyanka. This was the first of many such attempts to capture Kyiv during late July and into early August but all of these were unsuccessful. On August 8 the division, with one regiment of 28th Mountain, dug in along a line from Vishnyakov to Druzhnya. This line stretched due west from Hostomel. 27th Corps (now also containing the 8",
    "Species of lichen\nUmbilicaria angulata, commonly known as the asterisk rocktripe, is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Umbilicariaceae. It is found in northwestern North America and east Eurasia, where it grows on acidic rock.\nTaxonomy\nUmbilicaria angulata was formally described as a new species in 1848 by the American lichenologist Edward Tuckerman. The type specimen was collected from the northwest coastal region of California. In 1891, William Nylander thought the species was more suitably classified as a variety of Gyrophora vellerea. In 1911, Albert Herre proposed that the taxon should be accepted as a full species, but in the genus Gyrophora. This genus has since been subsumed into Umbilicaria.\nIt is classified in the subgenus Gyrophora of the genus Umbilicaria, according to a 2017 reorganisation of that genus informed by molecular phylogenetics. This subgenus consists of two groups, the monophyletic U.\u00a0vellea group, and the U.\u00a0angulata group, which consists of paraphyletic lineages.\n\"Asterisk rocktripe\" is a vernacular name that has been used for this species in North America.\nDescription\nThe lichen has an umbilicate thallus, meaning that it is attached to its rock substrate via a single attachment point, and typically reaches up to 5\u00a0cm (2\u00a0in) in diameter, although specimens up to 9\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in) are known. The thallus is brown to grayish-brown, while the lower surface is dark brown to black, with slender rhizines ranging in frequency from scarce to densely tangled. Although it does not have soredia or isidia, it produces apothecia (fruiting bodies) that are initially level with the thallus surface before becoming sessile. The ascospore made by Umbilicaria angulata are simple (without septa), with typical dimensions of 17\u201323 by 8\u201313\u00a0\u03bcm.\nThe thallus contains gyrophoric acid as a major secondary metabolite (lichen product), and smaller amounts of lecanoric acid and zeorin.\nHabitat and distribution\nUmbilicaria angulata is found in northwestern North America, with a range that includes the state of Oregon and the Cascade Range, extending north to costal Alaska. It grows on rock that is not calcareous, instead preferring acidic rock, often amongst scree on outcrops, and on steep rock faces. It also occurs in eastern Eurasia.\n",
    "In cost-benefit analyses of scientific grant proposals, the Szilard Point refers to the scenario in which the expenses incurred in obtaining a grant (E) are equal to the value of the awarded grant (V). Beyond this point, where the costs outweigh the benefits (E > V), the return on investment for pursuing the grant becomes negative.\nBecause the Szilard Point is more of a qualitative construct than a quantitative measure, and because the concept is rooted in a fictional story, the term has acquired several divergent meanings, such as the point at which tasks other than research, such as applying for grants, peer review, and handling administrative chores, would consume more time and resources than research itself. All definitions, however, allude to the decrease in the probability of obtaining research funding and the increase in bureaucratic burdens encountered in academia.\nOrigin of the term\nThe term Szilard Point was coined in 1988 by Richard Smith (then assistant editor of British Medical Journal), and independently in 1990 by Daryl E. Chubin (then staff member at the Science, Education, and Transportation Program, Office of Technology Assessment, Congress of the United States) and Edward J. Hackett (then associate professor, Department of Science and Technology Studies, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute).\nSzilard Point was named after physicist Leo Szilard, who in 1948 wrote a short story entitled \u201cThe Mark Gable Foundation.\u201d The story was published in a collection of short stories entitled The Voice of the Dolphins in 1961.\n\u201cThe Mark Gable Foundation\u201d explores several issues related to technological advancements, in particular socioeconomic changes, such as mass unemployment, as well as changes in societal norms and cultural practices, such as the widespread practice of teeth removal and the use of chewing plates. A major issue in the story is the necessity of scientific progress. The eponymous founder of the Mark Gable philanthropic foundation is asked by the unnamed narrator if he would like to use his considerable resources to advance science?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Mark Gable replies. \u201cI believe scientific progress is too fast as it is.\u201d\nThe narrator, then, suggests the foundation's resources be used to retard scientific progress. Mark Gable agrees, and the narrator tells him that retarding scientific progress is quite easy. All is needed is a foundation with a large annual endowment to which researchers in need of funds could apply for grants. Decisions will be made by ten committees, each composed of twelve scientists. The scientists on the committees will be the most active and productive scientists and they will be remunerated handsomely. This part of the plan will, in itself, contribute to the retardation of science by replacing productive scientific work with unproductive bureaucratic activities. The second part of the plan is to award huge yearly prizes for published scientific papers. This part will steer scientists towards problems that are considered promising in terms of publishable results instead of addressing questions that are difficult and important.\n\u201cFor a few years there might be a great increase in scientific output; but by going after the obvious, soon science would dry out. Science would become something like a parlor game. Some things would be considered interesting, others not. There would be fashions. Those who followed the fashion would get grants. Those who wouldn't wouldn't, and soon they would learn to follow the fashion, too.\u201d\nSzilard Point, Grant Proposals, and Peer Review\nSzilard Point (whether by name or by implication) has frequently been used in arguments against the practice of peer review in judging grant proposals. In 1984, Rostum Roy, a material scientist at Penn State University, used the following real-life example to illustrate the wastefulness of this system.\nIn 1983 the Department of Defense started a new program making available $30,000,000 annually to provide some large items of research equipment to universities. The Department of Defense issued an invitation for proposals to all universities. Over\n2,200 proposals were received for a sum of $625 million. The success ratio was less than 1:60. The time required for the preparation and submission of each proposal was estimated at one month's work of one person. Thus, more than 200 years of scientific work were diverted from research and devoted to the writing of grant proposal. If we include an average figure of 100% for overhead costs, the cost would be equal to 400 yearly salaries. Given the success ratio of 1:60, each scientific group would need to write on average 60 proposals to get one grant. A back-of-the-envelope calculation would yield a cost of about $480,000,000 for an allocation of $30,000,000. This cost does not include any administrative costs. This is an extreme example concerning a methodology that was fortunately not repeated, however, with 15\u201320% percent success rates, a \u201cSzilard point\u201d where waste exceeds",
    "Former building in Peru\nThe Banco Comercial was a multi-purpose office building located in the historic centre of Lima, Peru. It housed the Banco Comercial del Per\u00fa, after which it was named, and later the Banco de la Naci\u00f3n. The building was designed by Peruvian architect Enrique Seoane Ros, and built by Flores & Costa, S.A., a Peruvian construction firm.\nIt was destroyed by a fire during the Four Quarters March caused by a bomb reportedly planted under the orders of Vladimiro Montesinos, then director of the National Intelligence Service, in order to discredit the protests against Alberto Fujimori, then president of Peru.\nThe building was replaced by the Plaza de la Democracia, inaugurated on July 27, 2006, by Alejandro Toledo. The bank itself moved to San Isidro prior to the inauguration of its new headquarters in 2015.\nHistory\nThe building occupied an area of 3,114.78 m2. It had a basement used for parking, safekeeping and a base with four floors designated to be used as office space. The building was topped by a tower with 10 extra floors, occupying a total area of 22,000 m2 and costing an approximate $60 million.\nThe building's lower fa\u00e7ade featured marble baseboards, wall coverings in glazed national ceramics and natural color anodized aluminum doors and windows. The windows in the first floor were reinforced and the rest were tinted. The lower facade also featured the name of its occupant, Banco Comercial del Per\u00fa, until it was changed to the logo of the Banco de la Naci\u00f3n, a circle with the bank's initials (BN) inside.\nThe building had 7 Schindler elevators meant for public use, plus an freight elevator for cargo. Most of the materials used in the building were specifically chosen to be from Peru instead of being imported from other countries.\nThe building's basement was the location of the bank's vault, which had a wood finish and was designed to be easily guarded. It was also the location of a discount section that could be accessed by anyone. The building's first floor was made of grey marble.\nThe first floor's wall that faced the Colmena avenue was decorated by a mural of Machu Picchu that measured 4 \u00d7 15 metres reproduced on canvas. The furniture was made of mahogany or aluminum and walnut. Another wall featured a collection of moneyboxes from different countries. The building's third floor had offices and a staircase with suspended steps made of concrete covered in carpet.\nThe building's office tower was designed to work independently of the bank building, being leased to private tenants.\nThe building after the fire.\nOn July 28, 2000, amid the protests that surrounded the building and the centre of Lima known as the Four Quarters March, a fire began inside the building. Despite claims by Minister of the Interior Walter Chac\u00f3n of the opposite, the fire was caused by an explosion on the building's third floor which caused the structural integrity of the building's lower floors to be compromised, causing them to collapse and worsen the gravity of the situation. As a result, 6 security guards were killed in fire.\nThe explosion was reportedly caused by undercover agents acting under orders of Vladimiro Montesinos. The intent was to paint the protests in a negative light, and to link them to terrorist groups Shining Path and MRTA. The fire had been preceded by an attack on a policeman and his car, which was lit on fire, and riots caused by thugs paid organized by Carlos Regalado, who had been paid by Montesinos, to act as part of the crowd against law enforcement. The JNE building across was also set on fire. For his role in the bombing and the deaths of the six security guards, Montesinos was put on trial and sentenced in 2009 to 10 years in prison.\nOnce destroyed, and its structural integrity compromised, the building was condemned and demolished in 2005, with the basement being refilled with debris from the building. Plans to replace the building with a plaza were decided early on, with the new square's name originally being the Plaza of the Nation (Spanish: Plaza de la Naci\u00f3n), and its original design varying significantly from its final result, as it was originally meant to feature a fountain in the centre, and murals related to the event.\nSee also\nTorre Banco de la Naci\u00f3n, which replaced the bank's former building\n",
    "Australian rules football match\nThe 1990 OMFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football match contested between Lavington and Wodonga at Albury Sports Ground on 23 September 1990. It was held to determine the premiers of the Ovens & Murray Football League (OMFL), a semi-professional competition based around the Ovens Murray region in New South Wales and Victoria, for the 1990 season.\nThe match became known as the \"The Bloodbath\" after players were engaged in a succession of brawls early in the match. Footage of the brawls was shown around the world, and it has been described as the OMFL's \"darkest day\".\nWodonga won the match by 20 points, despite having trailed at the first three breaks, marking the club's fifth senior premiership. This was the second premiership for Jeff Gieschen as Wodonga coach, having coached the club to a victory in 1987, and he later went on to coach West Perth and Richmond.\nThe match was held following the 1990 reserves grand final, in which Lavington also played Wodonga, a match that was \"equally as fiery\" as the seniors.\nMatch summary\nAround a minute after the first quarter began, a brawl began between Lavington and Wodonga players, which lasted for around three minutes. Eventually, a free kick was awarded to Wodonga captain Ernest Whitehead almost directly in front of his club's goals. However, he missed and kicked a behind, in what was the first score of the match.\nKen Wright, one of the umpires on the  day, recalled in 2014 that \"we couldn't get the game going again because the ball had been kicked over the fence, so we didn't even have a ball\".\nLavington led by just two points at quarter time. Their lead was extended to 17 points at half-time, then cut slightly to 13 points at three-quarter time, before Wodonga kicked five goals and restricted Lavington to just four points in the final quarter to win the grand final.\nScoreboard\nAftermath\nFifteen players received a combined total of 68 matches in suspensions following the match \u2212 a combined 46 for Lavington players and 22 for Wodonga players.\nFootage of the brawls, which was broadcast live Prime Television, was shown across Australia and around the world.\nLegacy\nSee also: 2004 AFL Cairns Grand Final\nComparisons to this match were made following the 2004 AFL Cairns Grand Final between Port Douglas and North Cairns, where a brawl began moments after the conclusion of the national anthem before further fighting and the eventual stripping of the premiership against North Cairns.\nA documentary on the match was released on 15 July 2023 and premiered at the Albury Regent Cinema.\n",

The reserves squad play in the Vietnamese Second League, the third division of Vietnamese football league system. \nHistoryv and operations\nAfter Hanoi T&T Football Club was established in 2006, the team's youth academy was inaugurated. The academy received training for a large number of youth players from the Hanoi Sports Center in Gia L\u00e2m, Hanoi. In 2012, the academy merged with the VSH Academy owned by former Vietnamese international V\u0103n S\u1ef9 H\u00f9ng in Ngh\u1ec7 An and turned it into a satelitte academy of the main academy. The VSH bracnh would only trained players under-15 players and promising young talents will be transferred to the Hanoi Center to pursuit with higher training. In 2022, the club opened another satelitte youth academy in B\u1eafc Giang.\nHanoi FC sent many scouts to many localities in the North. Scouts will closely follow youth tournaments in many provinces to discover players with high potential from 11 years old to welcome them into the centralized accommodation at Hanoi's youth training center.\nThe team's training method is done scientifically, with connections between the age categories, ensuring the continuous and unified development of the players. The team builds a tight connection with its satellite academies, unifying the playing style of the players and the management apparatus. All exercises and development plans are aimed at building the football philosophy of the club's first team. The coaches in the Hanoi FC youth academy are required to have at least an AFC Pro Diploma.\nWith several achievements at Vietnamese youth football tournaments and the number of alumni players that became Vietnamese internationals, the Hanoi FC football academy is considered as one of the best football academies in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia. In the 2023 V.League 1 season, the Hanoi FC academy had the most former academy players competing in the league.\nHonours\n\nNational competitions\nVietnam National U-21 Championship\n Winners\u00a0:        2013, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2022\n Runners-up\u00a0:   2014, 2021\n Third place\u00a0:  2009, 2023\nVietnam National U-19 Championship\n Winners\u00a0:        2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022, 2024\n Runners-up\u00a0:   2015, 2018\n Third place\u00a0:  2013, 2023\nVietnam National U-17 Championship\n Runners-up\u00a0:   2014,\n Third place\u00a0:  2013, 2016, 2022\nVietnam National U-15 Championship\n Runners-up\u00a0:   2011, 2012, 2016, 2019\n Third place\u00a0:  2014, 2015\nCurrent squad\nThe following players were named in Hanoi Reserves squad competing in the 2024 Vietnamese Second Division.\nAs of 23 March 2024\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

    "Diplomatic mission of Sweden in Hong Kong\nDiplomatic mission\nThe Consulate General of Sweden, Hong Kong is the diplomatic mission of Sweden in Hong Kong. The Consulate General of Sweden in Hong Kong and Macau, established in 1968, plays a vital role in fostering relations between Sweden and the region, focusing on political, economic, and cultural ties. It actively promotes Swedish interests, including marketing products, attracting investments, and fostering educational exchanges. Furthermore, it monitors and reports on political and economic developments in Hong Kong and Macau to Swedish authorities. Additionally, the consulate provides consular services to Swedish citizens, offering support and assistance in various situations. Before 1997, the consulate covered British Hong Kong, and since then, it includes the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. The consulate's history dates back to 1853 when it was established as an honorary consulate, evolving into a career consulate in 1954 and later elevated to a consulate general in 1968.\nHistory\nBackground\nDuring the early years of the Age of Empire (1870s to mid-1880s), Sweden\u2013Norway sought to expand its influence by increasing its consular presence in territories where major imperial powers were establishing colonial order. Unlike these powers, Sweden\u2013Norway had few diplomatic missions, relying instead on consuls to represent its interests. The primary goal was to gain political prestige and economic benefits by supporting Swedish and Norwegian merchants and shipowners. However, the consular service faced several challenges. Consuls were often appointed based on reputation and connections rather than qualifications, leading to a lack of necessary skills and knowledge about Sweden\u2013Norway's economic interests. Many consuls were Western merchants who also represented multiple countries and were deeply integrated into colonial networks. Despite some successes in social and political integration, the consular service struggled with economic obstacles and ultimately failed to effectively support trade and shipping. Efforts to reform the consular service, including the appointment of a reform committee in 1875, were insufficient, and by the time of the Berlin Conference almost a decade later, significant issues remained unresolved. This lack of a well-thought-out plan led to an inefficient consular service that did not meet its intended economic goals.\n1853\u20131937\nIn the late 19th century, Hong Kong was recognized by Swedish-Norwegian authorities as an important distribution center, similar to Singapore. However, the economic strength of both colonies was insufficient to sustain substantial import and export trade. Most Swedish-Norwegian ships arrived in Hong Kong carrying coal from England and returned with rice and sugar. Despite these activities, the volume of trade and shipping between Sweden\u2013Norway and Hong Kong was limited, which impacted the consular services and their effectiveness in the region. The British dominions of British Hong Kong and British Singapore were part of the reorganization of the Swedish-Norwegian consular service in East Asia. Both consulates were established in the early 1850s and were initially operated by foreign merchant consuls. In Hong Kong, a group of German merchant consuls, working for the leading firms Russell & Company and Schellhass, played an important role. These firms were also significant players in Shanghai.\nThe consulate was established by letters patent on 3 June 1853, and its district included the British colony of Hong Kong. By decision on 15 November 1867, it was determined that a consulate general would be established for China and other East Asian countries with a salary of 8,000 riksdaler banco, and that Victoria in Hong Kong would temporarily serve as the residence of the consul general. However, on 22 November 1867, the salary was used to compensate Premi\u00e4rl\u00f6jtnant Herman Annerstedt for a special mission to study the trade and maritime conditions of the United Kingdoms in East Asia, and the consulate general was temporarily still located in Shanghai. Similar to the situation in Shanghai, the consulate in Hong Kong experienced considerable turbulence in the 1870s and 1880s. In April 1885, the Swedish-Norwegian government appointed Rudolf (Peter) Buschmann as the fifth consul in twelve years. Buschmann was a German merchant and senior partner of Schellhass, who also served as the Dutch consul. However, his tenure was short, lasting only three years before he was replaced by Friedrich Seip, who would become the last consul in Hong Kong.\nIn the early 1870s, the consular services in Victoria (Hong Kong) and other regions were criticized for their inadequacies. Norwegian dissatisfaction was particularly notable, and despite increasing commercial activities in East Asia, consular development lagged behind. Swedish-Norwegian ships visiting Hong Kong averaged 17 per year from 1870 to 1874, with the number ",

It is located in the neighbourhood of Centrum, within the Downtown district, at the intersection of Pope John Paul II Avenue, Jagiello\u0144ska Street, Kaszubska Street, Ma\u0142opolska Street, and Mazurska Street. It was opened in the 1890s.\nHistory\nThe Aviators Square (then known as the Augusta Square) in 1909.\nThe urban square was constructed in the 1890s, as an recreational area. It has a form of a square at the street intersection, with paver flooring and urban green areas. It was surrounded by tenements.\nIt was named Augusta Square (German: Augustaplatz; Polish: Plac Augusty), after Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,  the Queen of Prussia and the first German Empress. One of the intersecting roads, the Emperor William Street (now Pope John Paul II Avenue), was named after her husband, William I, the Emperor of Germany. In 1945, it was renamed to the Aviators Square.\nIn the 1950s, around the square was constructed portion of the Downtown Residential District, consisting of several socialist-realist multifamily residential buildings.

His father was Methodist reverend Charles Henry Laws. He was educated at Christchurch and Dunedin, and attended Christchurch Boys' High School. After two years at high school, Laws left in order to become a teacher himself. During World War I, Laws became a sergeant of the 12th Reinforcements in Egypt and France. He later studied at Auckland Training College and Auckland University College, beginning to teach at primary schools in 1921. He completed his Bachelor of Science at Auckland University College in 1922, and in 1925, he became the second person to complete a thesis on geology at Auckland University College, winning the Julius von Haast Prize, awarded by the University of London.\nFrom 1929 to 1931, Laws became a lecturer in geography at Dunedin Teachers' Training College, which he followed by being the Lecturer in Geography and Natural Science at Auckland Training College from 1932 to 1946. In 1946, he left to become the senior lecturer in geology at Auckland University College. Laws became acting head of geology in 1949 after the death of Arthur Bartrum.\nLaws was encouraged to study malacology by paleontologists Harold Finlay and John Marwick. During the 1930s and 1940s, Laws became an authority on the gastropod family Pyramidellidae, publishing 122 new descriptions for species within this family. Laws was also involved in major fossil finding expeditions at Kaawa Creek and Pakaurangi Point. In recognition of his work, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1950.\nLaws retired in 1959, after which he dedicated his life to spending time with family and his hobbies, including rose gardening.\nPersonal life\nIn 1921 Laws married Evelyn Katie Lee. Together they had twin daughters in 1925 and a son in 1933.

    "Nobleman of the Kingdom of Naples\nGoffredo Marzano (c.\u20091350 \u2013 after 1404) was a nobleman of the Kingdom of Naples who served as grand chamberlain in 1391\u20131393 and 1398\u20131399.\nA scion of the noble Marzano family\u00a0, Goffredo was the son of Roberto and brother of Giacomo, both of whom served as grand admiral of the kingdom. An important source for his life are the reports in the Diurnali del duca di Monteleone. He took part in the siege of Teano in 1373 and afterwards acquired the city. In 1381, he was one of the founding members of the Order of the Ship. On 10 November 1383, when Pope Urban VI was received in Naples, he accompanied King Charles III in holding the pope's reigns and leading him to the Castel Capuano. In 1384, he took part in the fighting against Louis II of Anjou in Apulia.\nFollowing Charles III's death in 1386, Marzano supported his widow, the regent Margaret of Durazzo. In October 1389, he brought Costanza Chiaramonte from Sicily to marry the young king Ladislaus in Gaeta. In 1390, he was one of Margaret's envoys to Pope Boniface IX who arranged Ladislaus' coronation. Between 1391 and 1393 he was the grand chamberlain with an annual salary of 75 onze.\nIn 1392, Marzano defended Aversa from the forces of Louis II. In 1393, he attended Ladislaus' parliament in Gaeta and joined him on campaign against L'Aquila. In 1395, the Sanseverino pealed the Marzano away from their allegiance to Ladislaus through a marriage project that never came to fruition. In 1398, Goffredo seized Capua and placed a certain Roberto di Prata in charge of the city. Ladislaus's forces besieged Capua for four months before it fell, but Marzano escaped to Alife. On 14 May 1398, Ladislaus reached a peace agreement with the Marzano brothers; Giacomo Orsini, Count of Tagliacozzo; and Giacomo Stendardo. Goffredo was rapidly restored to favour. Before the end of the year he was again grand chamberlain, an office he held into the following year.\nGiacomo died in 1402 and Goffredo became the guardian of his nephew, Giovanni Antonio Marzano\u00a0. In this capacity, he refortified Sessa Aurunca, Rocca Montis Dragonis\u00a0 and Teano. Ladislaus arranged the marriage of his illegitimate son Rinaldo with Marzano's daughter, but when Marzano came to Naples in 1404 to celebrate the wedding he was imprisoned in the Castel Nuovo. His counties of Alife and Teano were confiscated. The date of his death is unknown.\nNotes\n^ a b c d e f g h i Sardina 2008.\n^ Gambella 2013, n. 42.\n^ Boulton 2000, p.\u00a0292.\n^ Gambella 2013, p.\u00a0265.\n^ Kiesewetter 2004.\nBibliography\nBoulton, D'A.

    "American racing driver\nNASCAR driver\nJake Walker (born February 9, 2006) is an American professional auto racing driver who competes full time in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Series as a Pro driver with Forty7 Motorsports and part time with Turner Motorsport in their GT3 car for the IMSA WeatherTech Endurance Series. \nRacing career\nJake Walker is known for his achievements in karting and various car racing series. He began his racing career at the age of 9, participating in local go-kart races. By the age of 13, he had advanced to the national karting scene, securing multiple national podiums and a USPKS win. Walker's notable accomplishments in karting include winning the Rotax Max Challenge championship. Despite a long-term injury that prevented him from competing in the Bahrain Rotax Finals, Walker made a remarkable comeback to podium in the senior category.\nIn 2021, Walker transitioned to car racing by obtaining his SCCA license from the Bertil Roos driving school. By late 2022, he had fully shifted his focus to car racing, leaving the karting scene behind. He competed in several SCCA races in the Spec Miata class and successfully finished the Baja 500. His performance caught the attention of Forty7 Motorsports, leading to a test in their Lamborghini Super Trofeo car. Following a successful test, Walker prepared for a full-time racing career in the Super Trofeo series for the 2023 season.\nTo enhance his skills, Walker partnered with Indy 500 winner Buddy Rice and Brent Brush from Megapixel Management. He trained extensively, competing in WRL races with Pinnacle Motorsports in their Porsche GT4 and Legends races at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Walker achieved multiple podiums and wins in both WRL and Legends racing, including a notable win at Barber Motorsports Park.\nWalker began the 2023 Lamborghini Super Trofeo season in the AM category at Laguna Seca. However, after the first practice session, he was promoted to the Pro category and invited to join the Lamborghini Young Driver program. Throughout the season, Walker secured podiums at Road America and Indianapolis Motor Speedway, working closely with Buddy Rice and receiving support from Megapixel Management. He also continued to compete in WRL, earning additional podiums with Pinnacle Motorsport.\nAuto Technic Racing invited Walker to race their BMW GT4 car at Lime Rock, where he achieved two second-place podiums in his class. He was also approached by Samantha Tan Racing to drive their BMW GT3 car at the Indy 8 Hour in the SRO series in October of that year. Despite facing fueling issues, Walker demonstrated impressive pace.\nWalker concluded his first Super Trofeo season at the World Finals in Vallelunga, Italy. Despite an alternator failure in race 1, he was the highest-finishing American in race 2. He was one of eight drivers selected for the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Young Driver Shootout at Vallelunga following the World Finals after being evaluated throughout the season and at the Lamborghini training facility. \nIn 2024, Walker joined Turner Motorsport to compete in the WeatherTech Endurance Series in IMSA with their GT3 car. He teamed up with Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher for all races, and Jens Klingmann for the Rolex 24 Hour. Walker also continued racing in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo series.\nAt the Rolex 24 Hour, Walker and his team led the race and maintained a top-three position for most of the event before debris issues put them out of contention for a win. At Sebring International Raceway, Walker raced in both Super Trofeo and BMW GT3, finishing in the top three for most of the GT3 race before debris-related pit stop challenges resulted in loss of positions. \nWalker secured a P2 overall finish in race 2 of the Super Trofeo series at Laguna Seca, marking a strong start to his 2024 season.\nWalker made his debut in the ARCA Menards Series West at Portland International Raceway, driving the No. 23 Toyota for Sigma Performance Services, where after placing sixteenth in the lone practice session, he qualified in eighth but finished seven laps down in eighteenth place after experiencing engine issues on the opening lap that later led to a complete engine failure.\nMotorsports results\nARCA Menards Series West\nComplete WeatherTech SportsCar Championship results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; results in italics indicate fastest lap)\n",

His wife also stated that they threatened the other residents with burning down their houses as well if they reported about the matter to anyone.

The boat, costing \u00a3493, was funded by donations from Post Office staff, in memory of the late Sir Stevenson Arthur Blackwood KCB, Secretary-General of the GPO.\nThe first service for the lifeboat was on 2 March 1896, when she was launched to the steamship Rosstrevor, of the London and North Western Railway Company. Just leaving Greenore, she was aground on a rock. 17 women and children were taken off by the lifeboat, and landed at Greenore.  The boat was refloat a few days later and repaired.\nGreenore lifeboat house in 2007\nThe greatest shipping disaster to befall the area, was on 3 November 1915. In gale-force conditions, the passenger ferry SS Connemara, bound for Holyhead from Greenore, collided with the SS Retriever of the Clanrye Steamship company of Newry, at the entrance to Carlingford Lough. Both vessels sank within minutes. There was only one survivor, 97 perished. There is no record that the lifeboat was ever called.\nIn 1911, the Greenore Lifeboat would be called for the last time. 4 people were rescued from the yacht Volga, drifting and dragging her anchor in Carlingford Lough.\nWith no calls in 9 years, Greenore Lifeboat Station was closed in 1920.

    "\nThe battle of Kidal took place between November 10 and 14, 2023, during the Kidal offensive in renewed conflict between the CSP-PSD and the Malian Armed Forces and allied Wagner Group mercenaries during the Mali War. The city of Kidal had been under rebel control since 2014, and the 2015 Algiers Agreement enacted a ceasefire and Kidal Region subsequently was de facto controlled by rebel groups. When Malian and Wagner forces captured the city on November 14, it marked the first time in nine years that all Malian regional capitals were fully under Malian government control.\nBackground\nMain article: Kidal offensive\nDuring the initial Tuareg rebellion of 2012 that began the Mali War, Kidal was a flashpoint of conflict between the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), the Malian government, and jihadist groups. The first seizure of the city was in March 2012 by Ansar Dine and AQIM jihadists. The jihadists abandoned the city in January 2013 in the wake of Operation Serval, and was captured by the MNLA. Malian and French forces attempted to capture the town in May 2014, but were repelled by the MNLA and allied Arab Movement of Azawad (MAA) and High Council for the Unity of Azawad (HCUA) fighters, who created the Coordination of Azawad Movements (CMA) coalition. Shortly afterward, the Algiers Agreement was signed in 2015 and established a ceasefire between the CMA, Malian government, and the pro-government Platform coalition, allowing the CMA to control Kidal. In 2016, GATIA, a member militia of Platform, attempted to establish itself in Kidal but was chased out by the CMA.\nAt the start of 2023, tensions had intensified between the Malian junta that took power in 2021 and the allied Wagner Group mercenaries against the Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security, and Development (CSP-PSD), a coalition between the CMA and Platform. Malian and Wagner forces attacked the town of Ber in August 2023, the first major clashes between the two groups since the signing of the Algiers Accords in 2015. CSP-PSD spokesmen denounced the attack, and stated that retaliation would occur. The CSP-PSD then declared war on the Malian junta, and attacked Malian forces in Bourem and L\u00e9r\u00e9.\nPrelude\nOn the night of October 2, 2023 a column of 800 Malian and Russian forces launched an offensive towards Kidal. They captured Anefis on October 7, and Malian officials announced their intent to recapture the MINUSMA camps in Tessalit, Aguelhok, and Kidal that same day. MINUSMA peacekeepers hurriedly evacuated the camp in Kidal by October 31, and the CSP-PSD seized control not long afterward. Many residents of Kidal left the city expecting clashes.\nThe MINUSMA camp was targeted by Malian Bayraktar TB2 drones on the night between November 3 and 4. No casualties were reported. The camp was again targeted by drone strikes on November 7, with one bomb hitting the camp and two hitting outside of it. One bomb hit a school located near the MINUSMA camp, killing fourteen civilians including eight children and injuring over thirty others. Medical sources speaking to RFI stated ten people were killed including several children, a teacher, a member of the Kidal Interim Authority, a business manager, and a community leader.\nBetween November 9 and 10, new drone strikes targeted Kidal, again without any reported casualties.\nBattle\nOn November 10, Malian and Wagner forces stationed in Anefis moved towards Kidal. That same day, CSP-PSD fighters cut phone lines to Kidal, preventing saboteurs communicating rebel positions to the Malian army. The next day, fighting broke out in the Alkit Valley twenty kilometers from Kidal between the rebels and the Russo-Malian convoy. The clashes lasted for two hours until they ceased by nighttime. In the first spate of clashes, a Malian L-39 Albatros crashed on accident. Malian officials claimed that night to have broken the rebels' defenses, while the rebels claimed to have repulsed the Russo-Malian attack and inflicted significant losses.\nClashes resumed in the Alkit Valley on November 12. Both sides again claimed to have the advantage over the other, although RFI journalists stated that the frontlines had not changed. The Malian Army flanked the rebels from the south on November 13, reported that they arrived fifteen kilometers from Kidal and claimed to have foiled a series of small ambushes and attacks along the way. Ten CSP-PSD vehicles were destroyed in these engagements.\nThe Malian Army seized control of Kidal on November 14. A night attack by Wagner special forces was decisive in the Malian victory. CSP-PSD rebels fled north towards the towns of Abe\u00efbara and Aguelhok. In a statement, the CSP-PSD confirmed their withdrawal from the city, but stated they would keep fighting against the Russo-Malian forces. Malian president Assimi Go\u00efta stated \"Today, our armed and security forces have seized Kidal. Our mission is not complete. I recall that it consists of recovering and securing the integrity of the ",
    "2021 novel by Louise Erdrich\nThe Sentence is a 2021 novel by American author Louise Erdrich.\nSet in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the story concerns Tookie, an Indigenous woman who is haunted by Flora, a former customer at the bookstore where Tookie works. The book reveals that Flora, a white social worker who fraudulently identifies as Indigenous, has become a ghost due to her immense shame over being descended from a woman who enslaved and tortured Indigenous women.\nThe action unfolds primarily within Birchbark Books, a small independent bookstore that is a fictionalized version of the real Birchbark Books, which is currently owned by Louise Erdrich. Erdrich has several cameo appearances in the novel.\nThe novel spans one year, from All Souls' Day 2019 to All Souls' Day 2020, encompassing the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd, and the subsequent protests and civil unrest.\nPlot summary\nTookie, a formerly incarcerated Indigenous woman who found solace in books during her time in prison, now works at Birchbark Books. On All Souls' Day, the store's most annoying customer, Flora, dies suddenly while reading a mysterious book. Soon after, Tookie begins to suspect that Flora's spirit is haunting the bookstore, causing mischief and whispering in her ear. While Tookie is the primary target of Flora's haunting, her colleagues at the bookstore gradually acknowledge the presence of the ghost as well.\nFlora's daughter gives Tookie the book Flora was reading when she died, an unsettling tome titled The Sentence, leading Tookie to believe that it contains a sentence that killed Flora. As Tookie delves into the mysterious book, she finds herself haunted not only by Flora's ghost but also by painful incidents from her own past. As Tookie grapples with the aftermath of her traumatic upbringing and her incarceration, she struggles to maintain her grip on her life.\nThe book also reveals that Flora, through her genealogical research, discovered she was descended from a white woman who had enslaved and tortured Indigenous women, including Tookie's ancestor. This revelation adds another layer of complexity to the haunting, as Flora's guilt and remorse over her family's crimes fuel her desire for connection and forgiveness from Tookie. The relationship between Tookie and Flora is complicated even more by the revelation that Flora, a social worker, took care of Tookie and her mother when Tookie's mother succumbed to drug addiction.\nThe novel follows Tookie through the ups and downs of her personal life, including her marriage to Pollux, an Indigenous man and former police officer who develops COVID-19 during the first months of the pandemic. Before Pollux becomes ill, the racial tensions and social unrest in Minneapolis following George Floyd's murder have already strained his relationship with Tookie, forcing both of them to confront difficult truths about race, justice, and the morally ambiguous authority wielded by police officers. Pollux's daughter, Hetta, also plays a significant role in the story, as Hetta enlists Tookie and Pollux in the care and raising of her newborn son, Jarvis.\nThroughout the year, Tookie and her colleagues meet a variety of customers, including an enigmatic bookseller and scholar named Laurent. Laurent's knowledge of Indigenous folklore and his seemingly supernatural abilities hint at a possible connection to the spirit world, leading Tookie to question whether he might be a \"rugaroo,\" a shape-shifting creature from Anishinaabe mythology.\nThese events and encounters intertwine with the broader events unfolding in the city and the world. Tookie's journey of self-discovery and healing is interwoven with the collective struggles of her community and the nation, ultimately leading to a hopeful resolution on All Souls' Day 2020, as Tookie finds a way to forgive Flora, and lay her troubled spirit to rest, and Pollux begins to recover from COVID-19.\nMinor characters\nHetta: Pollux's daughter, a young Indigenous woman trying to understand her ancestry and place in the world. Laurent is the father of her son, although for most of the book it appears he has abandoned her to raise her child alone.\nAsema: A young woman who works at Birchbark Books and becomes involved in the mystery surrounding Flora's ghost.\nThemes\nGrief and loss: The novel delves into the different ways people cope with grief and the lingering presence of the dead.\nSocial justice and racial reckoning: The story addresses the issues of racial injustice and police brutality, particularly in the wake of George Floyd's murder.\nThe power of stories: Erdrich highlights the importance of books and storytelling in providing solace, connection, and understanding. The book is also metafiction, particularly since it contains a fictional book with the same title (\u201cThe Sentence\u201d) as the novel itself, and blurs the line separating real places, authors, and literary works from imaginary characters, texts, and events.\nResilience and community: The novel ce",

    "\nAllotments near The Hague (also called: Vegetable Gardens near The Hague) is a painting by the Dutch artist Jacob Maris. It was executed around 1878, using oil on canvas, and is 62.5 by 54 centimetres. It depicts a then still undeveloped part of The Hague near Scheveningen. Painted in the style of The Hague School, the work is in the collection of the Kunstmuseum Den Haag.\nContext\nApart from time studying in Antwerp and a stay in Paris from 1865 to 1871, Jacob lived and worked in The Hague, together with his brother Matthijs. He painted Allotments near The Hague around 1878, shortly after he moved to  Bazarstraat, not far from the Laan van Meerdervoort. The area was still largely unbuilt, and was dedicated to allotments for inhabitants of the city. It would only become urbanised at the start of the twentieth century.\nMaris' friend Th\u00e9ophile de Bock wrote about the origin of the painting. \"Around this time, Maris often went for walks with Anton Mauve past the  Laan van Meerdervoort towards Dekkersduin. On one of these walks he got the idea for the painting entitled Allotments in The Hague. While still in the open air, he drew some perspectives lines of the panoramic landscape on a sheet of paper, and when home he got to work. It became a majestic creation.\"\nAllotments near The Hague is painted in a broad impressionistic manner. The use of colour is  stemmig and focussed on emphasising the atmospheric representation of the clouds; the influence of seventeenth-century landscape painter Jacob van Ruisdael is recognisable. The thin grey autumn light spans the landscape and a glimmering silver light is reflected in the water. Autumnal mist pervades the painting, connecting the ground and the air. The vastness of the buildings and meadows is almost limitless, rhythmically interspersed with reed mats, gardeners' houses and pollard willows.\nMaris' manner of working has been described thus: \"He fumbles and messes around and gradually a harmony of colours emerges and the main lines are established. Only then does he finish the work with lively and thin brushstrokes. But that last touch is set with a master hand and the whole work has the solidity of the most precise drawing\". This descriptions fits well for the Allotments near The Hague.\nRelated sources\nJohn Sillevis and Anne Tabak, 'Het Haagse School boek'. Waanders Uitgevers, Zwolle, Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, 2001.

Until 1978, Iranian women had more rights than Spanish women, but since the Islamic revolution their rights have been cut, recalls Armanian, who is particularly critical of the revolution in Iran, the country from which she was exiled when she was 20 years old, when the country fell into the hands of the ayatollahs who replaced the shah's government.\nShe began writing at the age of 27 and published her first book at 32.

    "British-Canadian architect and cartographer\nSamuel Herbert Maw (September 12, 1881 \u2013 August 19, 1952) was a British-Canadian architect, delineator and cartographer. \nBorn in 1881 in the English county of Suffolk, he learned architecture in England and found success there as a delineator before emigrating to Canada in 1912. In Toronto, he worked for Darling & Pearson, a leading architectural firm, until 1918. During that time, he also worked on his own designs. In 1923, Maw moved to Montreal, where he collaborated with Philip J. Turner on St. Phillip's Anglican Church in Montreal West. In 1937, while back in Toronto, he worked on the design of the then Toronto Stock Exchange (now home to the Design Exchange), a notable Art Deco building of North America.  \nBesides his architectural work, Maw found success as a cartographer, starting in 1929 when he published a pictorial map of the St. Lawrence Estuary. In 1932, he published The City of Quebec, an intricate hand-drawn map of Quebec City with historical notes. It was reproduced thousands of times and led him to be commissioned to draw This Is Canada, a booklet of maps to commemorate the 1939 royal tour of Canada by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. The original folio was gifted to the king by prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. In 1942, the tercentenary of Montreal, he published La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, a map of the city in the style of The City of Quebec. In 1952, Maw died in Toronto at the age of 70.\nEarly life and career\nSamuel Herbert Maw was born in Needham Market, Suffolk, England on September 12, 1881. As a child, he attended Ackworth School in West Yorkshire. He went on to informally study architecture under John S. Dorden in Ipswich, Suffolk, before moving to London to continue his training under Edward William Mountford, a prominent Edwardian architect. There, he learned the skills of technical and artistic drawing, engraving and etching. In 1905, his drawings won him the Soane Medallion, bestowed by the Royal Institute of British Architects and named after architect John Soane. A travelling scholarship, the distinction allowed him to travel across Western Europe to further his training. In 1909, his work was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.\nWork in Canada\nEtching by Maw of Montreal's Sun Life Building, designed by Darling & Pearson (1917 or 1924)\nMaw emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1912, after a brief period working in New York City. He joined a leading architectural firm, Darling & Pearson, and drew architectural delineations of the firm's commissions at the request of Frank Darling. During that period, he also worked on his own architectural designs and submitted them in competitions.\nMaw left Darling & Pearson in 1918 to work in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1923, he moved to Montreal, Quebec to work in the office of Philip J. Turner, with whom he designed St. Phillip's Anglican Church in Montreal West. In 1925, he began practicing alone. In 1926, he joined the firm Ross & Macdonald, where he likely served as a designer and delineator on the project of Toronto's Royal York Hotel. After his time there, he returned to Toronto.\nIn 1929, Maw published a pictorial map of the St. Lawrence Estuary, from Quebec City to Gaspesia, commissioned by the province of Quebec's tourism office. In 1932, he achieved further recognition as a cartographer when he published The City of Quebec, an intricate and colourful map of Quebec City which he had begun working on in 1926. The map, which features detailed drawings of individual buildings and informative text on the history of the city, evokes the style of the Wonderground Map (1914) of London by MacDonald Gill. It was reproduced thousands of times and sold to visitors of Quebec City for nearly three decades.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange in 1973, before becoming the Design Exchange\nIn 1937, he collaborated as an associate architect with George & Moorhouse on what was then the Toronto Stock Exchange, now known as the Design Exchange. That building is considered a notable specimen of Art Deco architecture in North America. Following the popularity of The City of Quebec, Maw was commissioned to draw This Is Canada, a booklet of maps of each  Canadian province to commemorate the 1939 royal tour of Canada by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the first visit of North America by the reigning British monarch. The original folio was gifted to King George by Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.\nLa Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (1942)\nIn 1940, Maw began teaching Architectural Rendering and Perspective at McGill University in Montreal. However, as World War II unfolded, he soon left Montreal for Ottawa, where he worked for the Department of National Defence, making use of his engineering background. In 1942, on the tercentenary of Montreal, Maw published La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, a map of Montreal in the same style as The City of Quebec. Its historical accuracy was ensured by notary, politician and his",
    "American entrepreneur and historian\nDicksie Bradley Bandy (August\u00a011, 1890 \u2013 November\u00a05, 1971) was an American entrepreneur and historian.\nBandy was born on August 11, 1890, in Bartow County; her father Dick was a country doctor.\nShe attended Reinhart Normal College in Waleska, and Georgia State College for Women in Milledgeville. In 1915, she married Burl Jackson \"B.\u00a0J.\" Bandy, who worked for Southern Railway. While her husband served during World War I, Bandy worked as a telegraph operator.\nAfter the war, the Bandy family ran a country store in Sugar Valley, which was successful until the Great Depression. After the store closed, the Bandys had to look elsewhere for income.\nBy this time, the Dalton area was already well known for its large grassroots chenille bedspread industry, and the Bandys began hand-tufting bedspreads. Since her husband B.\u00a0J. had worked for the railroad, Bandy had a free rail pass, so she traveled to Washington, D.C. with samples of their bedspreads. There, Woodward & Lothrop purchased 400 spreads at $4.00/unit, which the Bandys produced for $2.00; Bandy traveled onward to Baltimore, where Hochschild Kohn's ordered 200 units. Her next trip to New York City resulted in Macy's ordering 1,000 bedspreads. By the end of the 1930s, the Bandys were reportedly the first people to ever earn $1\u00a0million in the bedspread industry. The family opened factories in Cartersville, Dalton, Ellijay, and Rome; the Cartersville location eventually would become the largest tufted textile mill in the country under the auspice of Bartow Textiles. Other companies that have origins in the Bandy family include Universal Carpets, Coronet Industries, and Southern Craft Company.\nFollowing the family's success, Bandy turned her attention to charitable causes, giving to Hamilton Memorial Hospital, the Dalton Salvation Army, and the Dalton Regional Library System. In the 1950s, she spearheaded the effort to restore and preserve the Chief Vann House, during which time she founded the Whitfield-Murray Historical Society. Ivan Allen Jr. was also involved with the Vann House effort. Bandy organized the opening ceremony on July 27, 1958. The Cherokee Nation named Bandy an official ambassador thanks to her work.\nBandy and her husband B.\u00a0J. had three children: Christine, Jack, and Dicksie Jr. B.\u00a0J. died in 1948.\nBandy died on November\u00a05, 1971 at the age of 81. She was added to the Georgia Women of Achievement in 1993.\n",

    "Sharon Steel Corporation was an American steel company. Chairmen included Henry A. Roemer and later, Victor Posner. It went bankrupt in the 1990s.\nHistory\nSharon Steel Hoop\nFrank H. Buhl and associates broke ground for the Sharon Steel Co. plant in 1900 in the City of Farrell, Pennsylvania. Sharon Steel Hoop, American Sheet and Tin Plate and the American Steel and Wire companies opened plants nearby, leading to population growth in the Shenango Valley. During the late 1920s, the four plants of U.S. Steel and Sharon Steel Hoop employed around 10,000 workers.\nSharon Steel Corporation\nIts predecessor company was the Sharon Steel Hoop Company. In March 1936, $6 million of issues was used to finance Sharon Steel by a banking group headed by Speyer Co. and Hemphill, Noyes Co..\nIn 1953, Henry A. Roemer was chairman of Sharon Steel Corporation. Sharon Steel Corporation closed a plant that employed 1,100 workers in Lowellville, Ohio in 1960, with all workers fired. The 500 acres in 1977 was owned by Gennaro Paving, while the mill itself was dismantled for scrap.\nIn 1964, Sharon Steel was utilizing the basic oxygen steel-making process in its manufacturing, including at its mill in Sharon, Pennsylvania.\nUnder chairman Victor Posner, in January 1981, Sharon Steel Corporation held 5.1 percent of the GAF Corporation common stock. That May, Sharon Steel sold its holdings in Foremost-McKesson for a substantial profit.\nIn 1983, Posner was CEO and chairman of Sharon Steel.\nIn 1985, Sharon Steel lost $64 million, after going in debt $145 million in 1984, during a downturn in the steel industry. It had a negative net worth of $197 million. In 1986, it was reported that Sharon Steel was in default on bond interest payments, and that it was considering seeking protection from creditors. At the time, it was 86% owned by the company NVF, which in turn was largely owned by Posner and Posner's family. n 1987, it was the 12th largest steel producer in the United States. Posner was \"ousted\" as chairman in 1988, according to Reuters.\nBankruptcy and sale\nWhen the company emerged from bankruptcy protection in November 1990, it was owned by the Castle Harlan Group. Concerning funding the cleanup of the Sharon Steel tailings site in Midvale, Utah, in 1990, the largest Superfund cleanup settlement ever made with a company in bankruptcy court was announced. The settlement was between Sharon Steel, the EPA, and the state of Utah.\nIn May 1992, Sharon Steel was based in Farrell, Pennsylvania and employed around 2,700 people. In November 1992, the company laid off its last 500 unionized employees. Around 100 employees remained.  After it filed for bankruptcy and closed down in late 1992, Sharon Steel Corp. was purchased by Caparo Steel, and later by Duferco Farrell Corp., and remained operating in 2001.\nIt closed its large mill in Farrell, Pennsylvania in November 1992, as well as two steel finishing operations in Howard, Ohio, in response to filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. \nOn July 20, 1993, the company announced that its main mill and two smaller operations would be permanently closed. The United Steelworkers of America had pushed for the designation of permanent closure to allow pension payments to 720 fired Sharon Steel workers. The workers who had been employed by Sharon Steel for at least 20 years were to receive pensions, while another 900 fired workers were without, according to the union.\nMills and facilities\nFairmont coke works\nIn 1979, it closed its Fairmont coke works site in West Virginia. Sharon had been facing $300 million in federal fines for pollution, although in 1982, the EPA agreed to drop the fines if Sharon handled the hazardous waste cleanup itself. In June 1983, Fairmont officials passed an ordinance targeted at Sharon, which banned the permanent disposal of hazardous waste in the city limits. Sharon contested the law to higher courts, arguing it pre-mpted state and federal regulations. In 1985, a judge gave the company an order to control its pollution in Fairmont.\nIn 2016, the EPA was in talks over addressing contaminated land at the Sharon Steel / Fairmont Coke works site in Fairmont. It had been built in 1918 by the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, and in 1948, purchased by Sharon Steel. It closed in May 1979. It was placed on the Superfund list in 1996. In 2022, Fairmont City Council was considering developing Sharon Steel Corporation's \"old Fairmont Coke Works site,\" long decommissioned.\n",

For other uses, see Backstrom.\nB\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m is a Swedish television crime drama series, which was broadcast on C More Film from 23 March 2020. It is based on Leif G. W. Persson's book series about police inspector Evert B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m. An American TV series, Backstrom (2015), is based on the same character, but transposed to Portland, Oregon. For the Swedish show Evert is depicted by Kjell Bergqvist, across three seasons of six episodes each. Although season one's action is largely set in Stockholm and its surroundings, filming began in Gothenburg in March 2019 with Jonathan Sj\u00f6berg\u00a0 and Amanda Adolfsson\u00a0 directing three episodes each. Sj\u00f6berg was also the main scriptwriter with Dennis Magnusson\u00a0. Assisting in each season are Evert's colleagues Ankan (Agnes Lindstr\u00f6m Bolmgren\u00a0), Toivonen Pekka Strang, Kristian (Filip Berg), Adam (Peshang Rad\u00a0) and Peter (Rolf Lydahl\u00a0). Evert mentors his upstairs neighbour Edvin (Elvis Stegmar\u00a0).\nDuring the first season, which is based on Persson's Kan man d\u00f6 tv\u00e5 g\u00e5nger? (English: Can You Die Twice?), Evert's team investigate the death of Jaidee (Sandra Yi Sencindiver), who supposedly died in Thailand during the 2004 Asian tsunami. However, Edvin found Jaidee's skull, with a bullet hole, on a Swedish island. Evert has to contend with various suspects, including his celebrity TV rival, the lawyer Tomas (Jens Hult\u00e9n), scout leader Haqvin (Johan Widerberg) and Jaidee's husband Daniel (Linus Wahlgren). Season two, based on Den sanna historien om Pinocchios n\u00e4sa (2013, English: The True Story of Pinocchio's Nose) has Evert discovered at Tomas's murder scene. Besides solving that crime, Evert searches for a unique child's toy and musical box, shaped as Pinocchio, while obscuring its significance from his colleagues and evading his enemies. The third season is based on Persson's characters with its action mostly set in Palma de Mallorca (Palma), Spain. Besides solving a local murder, Evert hopes to resolve the historical murder of his first love, Sally.\nPremise\nSeason one:\nIn mid-2019 Edvin brings a human skull to Evert, which he found on Of\u00e4rds Island. Toivonen wants Evert to investigate an armoured car robbery but Evert refusues: he only does homicides. Ankan takes on the robbery case while also assisting Evert. When Evert brags on national TV to his rival, Tomas, that the robbery is simple, he annoys both Ankan and Toivonen. The latter appoints Hanna to supervise Evert. Toivonen also assigns injured policemen, Olsson and Olzzon, to assist Evert. With Peter's help Evert find's the rest of the skeleton inside an overgrown root cellar \u2013 its been there for eight years. DNA analysis determines that the remains belong to Jaidee.

Jaidee's corpse was identified by her husband Daniel and her DNA checked by a Swedish police team led by Hanna's father.\nEdvin suspects his scout leader Haqvin and finds photos: one shows Haqvin yachting with Jaidee, another links Daniel, Haqvin and Tomas. Evert starts a relationship with publicist Tina. After visiting Thailand, Evert believes that Jaidee and Daniel formed a threesome with bar girl Jada. When Jada died in the tsunami, Daniel and Jaidee used the opportunity for insurance fraud. Thereafter Jaidee posed as Jada. By mid-2011, Jaidee wanted to leave Daniel. Tomas advised Daniel to stop Jaidee as they would both face fraud convictions. Tina betrays Evert to her Russian mafia debt collectors, who want him to stop investigating their robbery.

    "2024 fatal building explosion in a downtown area\nOn May 28, 2024, a large and powerful explosion destroyed most of the first floor of the Realty Building in the downtown district of Youngstown, Ohio, US, and severely damaged the floors above it, killing one bank employee and injuring seven. The explosion was suspected to have been caused by a natural gas leak, although the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation.\nBackground\nThe Realty Building in 2008\nThe Realty Building was constructed in 1924 for the Realty Guarantee and Trust Company, and was designed by architect Morris W. Scheibel. In 1955, gale-force winds severely damaged and tore the roof off of the building, requiring $50,000 to repair. In 2009, the building was renovated into a 23-unit apartment complex. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nOn the day of the explosion, Greenheart Companies workers approved by the Youngstown Board of Control were present in the basement to clear debris, piping, and old utility lines for water, gas, electrical, data, and phone lines. They made three cuts onto a pipeline on the basement wall, with the third cut believed to have caused a gas leak six minutes prior to the explosion. After evacuating the basement, the crew immediately pulled the fire alarm, alerted the Chase Bank on the first floor, called 911, and tried to evacuate residents.\nExplosion\nOn May 28, 2024, at 2:45\u00a0p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), a large explosion occurred at the base of the building, destroying the fa\u00e7ade, throwing glass, brick, and other debris onto the sidewalk, caused the downtown area of Youngstown to rumble, and causing the first floor housing a Chase Bank to collapse into the basement. The explosion killed 27-year-old bank employee Akil Drake, who was found deceased in the basement. The explosion also injured seven people who were taken to Mercy Health Hospital, with one person in critical condition.\nA security camera video taken inside the 12th floor of the building showed fire alarms going off and residents evacuating before the explosion occurred, which blew out walls and caused significant damage inside the elevator lobby.\nWorkers who were in the basement prior to the explosion played a significant role in evacuating several residents in the building after the explosion.\nAftermath\nFollowing the explosion, Youngstown city officials restricted access to the building due to the explosion possibly compromising its structural integrity. They hired consultant engineers Barber and Huffman to collaborate with the building's owners and insurers on investigating the building to assess its safety and whether the building can be repaired or if it needs to be demolished. National Transportation Safety Board investigators were not able to access the building to investigate and collect evidence of what caused the blast until the structural integrity of the building was finished being assessed.\nA celebration of life service was held for Akil Drake on June 7 and June 8.\nStarbucks in Austintown partnered with the United Way of Youngstown and the Mahoning Valley to collect donations and essential items for those displaced by the explosion. The OH WOW! Children's Museum scheduled announced a community event for June 29 to aid collection for United Way and to make \"thank you\" cards for first responders.\nSee also\n2019 Durham gas explosion\n2015 East Village gas explosion\n2014 East Harlem gas explosion\nCleveland East Ohio Gas explosion\nList of explosions\n",
    "Gibraltarian footballer\nJaylan Ernest Hankins (born 17 November 2000) is a Gibraltarian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Lincoln Red Imps and the Gibraltar national team.\nClub career\nHankins came trough the youth ranks of Lincoln Red Imps and made his senior breakthrough for their Gibraltar Second Division farm team Red Imps in 2015. In January 2017 he was one of a number of young prospects that joined Gibraltar Premier Division strugglers Europa Point on loan for the remainder of the season, playing 12 times for them but was unable to prevent relegation. However, his performances impressed his parent club, and he began to make infrequent appearances for Lincoln over the next two seasons before moving to the Canary Islands to play for UD Las Palmas. Despite only playing 4 games for their C team, he became a regular on the bench for their B team, albeit not making an appearance. Despite renewing his contract in April 2020, he attracted the attention of C\u00f3rdoba who signed him that summer, subsequently loaning him to financially troubled Extremadura for the 2020\u201321 season. However, he did not play for the club and returned to C\u00f3rdoba at the end of the season to play for their B team.\nDespite agreeing a new contract in June 2022, he returned to Gibraltar later that summer and re-joined Lincoln Red Imps, who subsequently loaned him out to FCB Magpies. There, he won his first piece of silverware against his parent side as Magpies secured the 2022\u201323 Rock Cup. His loan was extended for a further season and he featured in Magpies' maiden Europa Conference League campaign against Dundalk, notably keeping a clean sheet in the first leg. However, a serious injury would rule him out of the majority of the season, only returning to action on 12 April 2024 in a 2\u20132 draw with Europa Point.\nInternational career\nAfter playing through every international age group, Hankins made his debut for Gibraltar on 3 June 2024 in a friendly against Scotland. He kept his first clean sheet for them in the following match when they drew 0\u20130 with Wales on 6 June 2024.\n",
    "In the laws of Shabbat, Kli SheMelachto LeIsur (A tool whose defined use involves work forbidden) is one of the types of muktzeh, which is - an item that is typically used for activities that are forbidden on Shabbat. Under certain conditions, the sages permitted the use of these utensils, provided that they are intended for a use that is allowed on Shabbat.\nBackground\nThe regulation that restricted the carrying of \"A tool whose defined use involves work forbidden\" is attributed to Nehemiah, as it appears in the verse. The prohibition on utensils whose primary use is prohibited was not to carry them at all, even for their own use or for the use of their place, because Nehemiah saw that people were lenient with the laws of Shabbat and were carrying from a private domain to a public domain, thereby violating the prohibition of carrying, which is one of the thirty-nine primary categories of labor. Therefore, to create a safeguard, they completely prohibited the carrying of all utensils in the house. After Nehemiah saw that the observance of Shabbat had strengthened among the people, they again permitted the carrying of utensils whose primary use is permitted, and after a period, they even permitted the carrying of utensils whose primary use is prohibited for their own use or for the use of their place.\nA household hammer is a tool whose craft is forbidden and it is allowed to shake it for its own purpose - (cracking nuts for example) or its place\nPermits for Using a Tool Whose Primary Function is Prohibited\nA household hammer is a tool whose primary function is prohibited, but it is permitted to move it for its own use - (for example, cracking nuts) or for its place.\nFor its own use - to use it in a manner that is permitted on Shabbat by the object's body. For example: although a hammer is a tool whose primary function is prohibited because it is used for building, it is permitted to use it on Shabbat to crack nuts.\nFor its place - to move it from a certain place because that place is needed. For example: if a tool whose primary function is prohibited is left on a sofa. When one wants to sit on that sofa, it is permissible to move that object.\nAdditionally, even if one wants to save the tool itself or use it in a manner that is not permitted on Shabbat, one can also find a permissible use for the tool even if that is not the main purpose. For example: one can bring a phone inside from the yard where it is raining, provided that the phone itself is used. Another way to move a tool whose primary function is prohibited to save the tool itself (such as from sun to shade) is by placing a non-muktzeh object on it. When moving a tool whose primary function is prohibited in one of these two ways, it can be placed wherever one wants and there is no obligation to leave it immediately. A tool whose primary function is prohibited is only such a tool that one does not mind using for another purpose, like a hammer. Any tool whose primary function is prohibited and one is particular not to use it for any other purpose besides its intended function is considered muktzeh due to monetary loss. The examples given in the Shulchan Aruch are: a slaughtering knife and a circumcision knife, scribal tools, and the like. For this reason, any expensive device that is not moved from its place for any purpose other than its intended function, such as sensitive electrical devices, is considered muktzeh due to monetary loss.\nA utensil whose primary use is for prohibited and permitted activities\nA utensil that is used for both permitted and prohibited activities, if its primary use is for prohibited activities and only occasionally used for permitted activities, it is considered a utensil whose primary use is for prohibited activities. However, if it is made for both prohibited and permitted uses, it is allowed to be moved on Shabbat and is treated as a utensil whose primary use is for permitted activities, which means it can be moved for any purpose, even to protect the utensil itself (but not without any purpose at all).\n",
    "Archaeological site in Israel with an ancient synagogue\nThe Ein Gedi synagogue is located within the remains of the ancient Jewish settlement of Ein Gedi. The archaeological site is part of the Ein Gedi Nature Reserve in the Judean Desert.\nAs for the synagogue itself, it is dated to the 3rd century CE, when the settlement was renewed after its destruction in the Bar Kokhba revolt. The use of the synagogue continued until the 6th century CE, when the place was destroyed again and the synagogue was burned.\nFindings of the excavations\nThe Synagogue was discoreved by chance in 1965 whilst plowing one of the firlds of Kibutz Ein Gedi. Apart of a mosiac was uncovered and that led to the excavations at the site. The archaeological excavations took place between 1970 and 1972 by Dan Barag, Y. Porat, and Ehud Netzer. A synagogue that existed for about 400 years was uncovered at the site. The synagogue's longitudinal axis is from north to south, the original entrance was from the north, and only later was an entrance opened from the south. In the eastern wall of the synagogue, a seat for the head of the congregation, referred to in sources as the \"Cathedra of Moses\" is carved into the wall.\nThe synagogue itself was destroyed along with the entire settlement of Ein Gedi between 602 and 610 CE, and it was completely burned.\nIn 1970, during the excavations, many charred remains of a parchment scroll were discovered inside the synagogue's Holy Ark, which was deciphered only in 2015 using 3D scanning with a micro-CT system. The parchment revealed a fragment from the beginning of the Book of Leviticus.\nThe findings at the Site\nFrom the first phase of the synagogue, a mosaic floor has been preserved with a swastika-like pattern \u2013 a design also found in the synagogues at Katzrin and Gamla, among others. This is an ancient decorative motif that was used in many cultures, as revealed in archaeological excavations around the world. A later mosaic included inscriptions in the Aramaic language, which are currently displayed at the Rockefeller Museum. The content of the inscriptions is:\nA list of generations from Adam to Japheth.\nA list of the zodiac signs (in Hebrew)\nA list of the Hebrew months, ending with the mention \u2013 \"Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah \u2013 peace upon Israel.\"\nAn inscription dedicated to the donors for the synagogue's repair.\nA long inscription referring to the rules of conduct in the Ein Gedi community, stating that anyone who causes a dispute between a person and his friend, speaks slander about his friend to the Gentiles, steals, or reveals the secret of the town - the secret of making balsam oil, on which the local economy was based and was an important export product,He whose eyes roam throughout the earth and sees the hidden things, he will set his face against that man and his offspring and uproot him from under the heavens. And all the people will say Amen and Amen Selah\"\nA burnt scroll found at the site was deciphered in 2015 using CT technology. It was revealed that the scroll contained the beginning of the Book of Leviticus and is dated to the sixth century CE.\nThe mosaic floor included designs of menorahs surrounding the central carpet. Two mosaic carpets with a geometric structure of squares and triangles, featuring plant and bird designs. In the four corners of the central mosaics are decorated pairs of male peacocks. Each pair of peacocks holds a cluster of round grapes. In the central circle are designed two cranes and two blue porphyries, which were probably very common in the nature of the Land of Israel in the past. Another find is a small cast bronze menorah with seven branches (22\u00a0cm by 14\u00a0cm) that was likely part of the decoration of the Holy Ark. Another unique find is a collection of goat and sheep bones found under the Holy Ark. Most of the bones were burnt. The excavators could not determine whether the bones were burnt together with the synagogue or before that. It was suggested that the bones are remnants of an earlier altar from the Second Temple period, several hundred years earlier. Additionally, a treasure of 5,000 coins from the 4th century to the time of Justin II (565\u2013578) was found, possibly the synagogue's charity fund; a bronze goblet; embroidered curtain decorations with gold threads and leaves, and another tiny seven-branched menorah made of silver.\nThe inscription dedicated to the donors\nA section of the mosaic with the inscription dedicated to the donors for the synagogue's renovation is displayed at the Hecht Museum in Haifa. The inscription is in Aramaic, The translation of the inscription is: \"Remembered for good are all the townspeople who gave their money for the repair of the synagogue. Remembered for good is Jonathan the cantor who gave his money for the repair of the synagogue. Peace.\nThe nature of the curse in the inscription\nMosaic floor - at the Rockefeller Museum.

    "2000 United States Supreme Court case\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000), was a United States Supreme Court case decided on April 18, 2000. It concerned a federal habeas corpus petition brought by convicted murderer Terry Williams, who alleged that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Supreme Court's prior decision in Strickland v. Washington. The Supreme Court's decision in this case was split across two majority opinions, one authored by John Paul Stevens and joined by five other justices, and the other authored by Sandra Day O'Connor and joined by four other justices.\nBackground\nTerry Williams was convicted of robbery and capital murder by a jury in September 1986, and after his subsequent sentencing hearing, the trial judge sentenced Williams to death. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence in a 1987 decision. In 1988, Williams filed a collateral attack on his sentence in Danville Circuit Court. The same judge who oversaw Williams' trial and sentencing hearing held evidentiary hearings for two days. The judge subsequently concluded that Williams' conviction was valid, but that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing because his lawyers had failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence. The judge therefore recommended that Williams receive a new sentencing hearing, but the Virginia Supreme Court declined this recommendation, arguing that even if Williams had received ineffective assistance of counsel, he had not suffered sufficient prejudice to warrant relief.\nWilliams then filed a habeas petition in federal court, and the federal judge concluded that Williams' death sentence was constitutionally invalid due to the ineffective assistance of counsel identified by his original trial judge. This federal judge also concluded that the Virginia Supreme Court's prior denial of state habeas relief to Williams \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law\", and thus grounds for federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(d)(1), a provision of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed this ruling, holding that \u00a72254(d)(1) bars federal habeas courts from granting relief to state prisoners unless the state court that previously adjudicated their claim \"decided the question by interpreting or applying the relevant precedent in a manner that reasonable jurists would all agree is unreasonable\".\nSupreme Court\nThe Supreme Court faced two questions in this case: whether Williams had indeed received ineffective assistance of counsel, thereby violating his constitutional rights under the Sixth Amendment, and whether the Virginia Supreme Court's decision to uphold his sentence \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\", one of the two circumstances in which AEDPA permits federal habeas courts to grant relief to state prisoners. Ultimately, it answered both questions in the affirmative.\n",
    "Political party in New Caledonia\nThe Federation of The National Rally (French: La f\u00e9d\u00e9ration du Rassemblement national; abbreviated RN) formerly known as the National Front is a political party that acts as the regional wing of the French National Rally in the French Overseas Territory of New Caledonia. It is currently led by businessman and former Caledonia Together politician Alain Descombels.\nThe RN is a loyalist party, opposing both the full independence of New Caledonia and concessions towards Kanak nationalist forces. Unlike other anti-separatist parties represented in the Congress of New Caledonia which exist as independent entities affiliated to parties in metropolitan France, the RN of New Caledonia functions as an extension of the same party in France.\nHistory\nThe New Caledonia federation of the National Front was created in 1984 in response to growing tensions and violence between loyalists and militant separatist groups such as FLNKS during a period known as \"the events.\" Some loyalist activists had also come to see The Rally under its leadership of Jacques Lafleur as too moderate and supported Jean-Marie Le Pen's call for a \"French Caledonia.\" Among the parties founders included former mayor of Thio and Caledonian Union politician Roger Galliot. The party also formed an alliance with another far-right anti-separatist party the Caledonian Front led by Justin Guillemard.\nThe party saw a peak of popularity during the 1980s. It first contested the 1984 New Caledonian legislative election and won a seat which was taken by Galliot. The party later increased to three representatives during the early 1985 New Caledonian legislative election during which Le Pen visited New Caledonia to organise the party's campaign. During the 1988 territorial elections, it won 8 seats out of 48 and become the second dominant anti-separatist party after The Rally.\nThe National Front's support declined during the 1990s, as violence between groups died down and the party rejected the Noum\u00e9a Accord. The party's support was also concentrated in the South Province which saw it in competition with other new loyalist parties. Although the party predominantly consolidated its support with Caldoche communities, the National Front also began expanding to Wallisians and loyalist Kanaks who had been targeted militants. In 1999, the party lost all of its representatives and subsequently endorsed Harold Martin and his Future Together party until 2009 when it tried to contest the New Caledonia Congress elections but did not see any candidates elected.\nIn 2021, the party regained representation in the Congress for the first time when representative Guy-Olivier Cu\u00e9not was nominated to take over from fellow Future with Confidence member Christopher Gyg\u00e8s who resigned his seat.\n",
    "Finnish audio equipment manufacturer\nNeural DSP Technologies is a Finnish audio equipment manufacturer founded in 2017 by Douglas Castro and Francisco Cresp.  Headquartered in Punavuori, Helsinki, the company is best known for its flagship guitar amp modeler, the Quad Cortex, and for its amp modeling audio plug-ins that create computer-based virtual amplifier and effects modelling suites.  The company is considered a leading developer of guitar signal processing technology.\nHistory\nIn 2016, Douglas Castro, the founder of bass guitar equipment company Darkglass, was approached by employee Francisco Cresp about creating an audio plug-in for the company.  Castro was interested, and the pair\u2014both Chilean immigrants in Helsinki\u2014decided to develop plug-ins for both bass and guitar, in addition to a potential modeler, but under a new name to preserve Darkglass' bass-oriented brand identity.\nNeural DSP began recruiting designers in late 2017 and early 2018, and in that April released the \"Darkglass Ultra\" plug-in, followed in September by the \"Fortin Nameless.\"  The \"Archetype\" audio plug-in series was co-developed with high-profile players such as Tim Henson, Cory Wong, and Plini.  The public profile these plug-ins created for Neural DSP allowed the company to pursue the creation of its companion hardware device, the Quad Cortex.  With companies like Fractal and Universal Audio having achieved great levels of accuracy in recreating amp tones, Neural emphasized significantly improving the user experience as the route to the Cortex's success.  Neural soon ran into the slow and expensive process of programming numerous DSPs at the same time, and to expedite the process they utilized AI machine learning, with the assistance of Aalto University's DSP program.\nCastro later described the Quad Cortex's development process as initially \"a black hole of money\"; production was then complicated by supply chain shortages resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the company at risk of closing, despite millions of dollars in investment.  The Quad Cortex was a success upon its release, and in 2021 Neural's revenue was split equally between software and hardware.  Castro was subsequently named Finland's 2022 EY Entrepreneur Of The Year, while the following year Castro and Cresp were recognized by Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 for Neural DSP's success on the international market.\nProducts\nQuad Cortex\nUpon its release in 2020, Neural DSP claimed the Quad Cortex was the most powerful floor modeler on the market, with 2\u00a0GHz in digital signal processing power via four SHARC+ processors.  The Cortex shipped with 50 available guitar and bass amp models, 70 effects, and a thousand impulse responses.  It also had features competitors like the Fractal  Axe-FX and the Line 6 Helix floor modelers did not, like a touch screen interface, Wifi connectivity, and footswitches that combine stomp functionality with rotary actuators.  The Cortex also has companion software that allows users to \"capture,\" or digitally recreate, their own analog guitar gear and share it with other users via the Cortex Cloud.\nPlug-ins\nNeural DSP designs both amplifier series plug-ins and signature plug-ins for individual artists.  Artists with signature plug-ins include Henson, Wong, Plini, Gojira, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and John Petrucci of Dream Theater.\n",

    "French-based GE's company in Belfort\nArabelle Solutions, formerly GEAST, for \u2018GE-Alstom\u2019, most of which was spun off from GE Steam Power, is a French multinational specialising in nuclear activities related to steam turbines (Arabelle) for the conventional island, present in nearly 16 countries including China, Finland, India, Romania and the United Kingdom, and headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. At Belfort, it is developing the Arabelle nuclear turbine, the most powerful in the world.\nHistorically based in France, notably at its Belfort site, it has been a subsidiary of EDF since 31 May 2024. Originally a joint subsidiary named GEAST between General Electric and Alstom, it became an 80%-owned subsidiary of General Electric, then of GE Vernova, in October 2018. The French state held a 20% stake in GEAST. Headed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Wiscart, GEAST also brought together GE Steam Power's nuclear activities, resulting from the acquisition of Alstom Power in 2015, through its two subsidiaries GE Steam Power Systems (formerly Alstom Power Systems) and GE Steam Power Service (formerly Alstom Power Services).\nThe controversial sale to General Electric was accompanied by safeguards given the strategic nature of the turbines for France, which retained intellectual property rights and a golden share in GEAST.\nWhen it was acquired by EDF, it was supplemented by GE Steam Power's global activities outside the Americas, also resulting from the acquisition of Alstom Power by the former US conglomerate General Electric in 2015.\nHistory\nOrigins\nIn the 1950s, Rateau and General Electric developed the first nuclear steam turbines at Marcoule in France and Dresden in the United States. In the 1970s, Alstom acquired Rateau, which became Alstom Rateau. The name \u2018Arabelle\u2019 comes from the contraction of \u2018Alstom Rateau Belfort Le Bourget\u2019.\n2014: General Electric acquires Alstom Power\nIn 2014, the partial takeover of Alstom by General Electric (GE) was proposed for $13\u00a0billion. Emmanuel Macron, then an adviser and then a minister under Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, agreed to the sale by Alstom of part of its energy business to its American competitor.\nA joint GE-Alstom subsidiary was then created: GEAST. This combined the activities of two of Alstom's subsidiaries: Alstom Power Systems and Alstom Power Service. GEAST was 80% owned by General Electric and 20% by Alstom. It has \u2018specific governance rules\u2019 designed to protect national interests, including maintaining in France a strategic activity developed by Alstom, such as the Arabelle turbine, the most powerful in the world.\nIn January 2016, GE announced that it was cutting 6,500 jobs in Europe, including 765 in France, in Alstom's energy business. It was specified that the Belfort site would not be affected.\nIn June 2016, General Electric, which is now responsible for maintaining Alstom Power's Arabelle turbines that power France's nuclear power plants, wanted to reduce its financial liability in the event of an incident, even if it meant entering into a showdown with EDF.\n2018: Alstom withdraws completely from GEAST\nAccording to a report dated 17 January 2018 by the French National Assembly's committee of enquiry tasked with examining the French government's industrial policy decisions in the light of the company mergers that have taken place, particularly in the cases of Alstom, Alcatel and STX, and the means likely to protect national industrial flagships in a globalised commercial context, one of the members of GEAST's board of directors is appointed by the French government, The government has a specific right of veto (or golden share) for any decision \u2018that would affect the integrity and continuity of GEAST's industrial offering around the conventional island, or call into question the rights held by the government at the time of the acquisition with regard to intellectual property or the research and development programme for which it has exclusive rights\u2019.\nOn 2 October 2018, Alstom sold its 20% stake in its three energy joint ventures with GE, namely the Renewables, Grid and GEAST nuclear joint ventures.\nIn 2020, in search of cash, General Electric is committed to selling a large part of its assets, including potentially GE Steam Power and GEAST, the former Alstom nuclear activities.\n2022\u20132024: sale to EDF\nIn January 2022, France's EDF and General Electric agreed to acquire part of GE Steam Power (formerly Alstom Power Systems), GE Power's nuclear activities. EDF will pay around \u20ac175\u00a0million for this transaction, after taking into account the cash and debt of the business acquired. This former Alstom Power business, valued at one billion euros, is mainly grouped in GEAST.\nOn 10 February 2022, France's EDF and General Electric announced that they had signed an exclusivity agreement regarding EDF's proposed acquisition of GE Steam Power's global nuclear business, primarily the GEAST and Arabelle turbine businesses. The sale excludes GE Steam Power's US operations. EDF will pay approx",

    "1989 short story by Greg Egan\n\"The Cutie\" is a science-fiction short story by Australian writer Greg Egan, first published in Interzone #29 in May/June 1989. It was his first to be published in Interzone. The short story was included in the collection Axiomatic in 1995. It also appeared in the anthology Interzone: The 4th Anthology edited by John Clute, David Pringle and Simon Ounsley in 1989.\nPlot\nA lonely man with a desperate wish to be a father undergoes a medical procedure to impregnate himself with a \"Cutie\", a child with reduced mental capacities (including the inability to speak), reduced legal status (regarded to be more like a pet) and a lifespan of only four years. When she unexpectedly succeeds to speak simple words, the man begins to form a stronger attachment to her and even unsuccessfully tries to postpone the early death integrated into her genetics. After her death, the mourning father is left wondering, whether her death would have meant this much to him if she never had attempted to speak at all.\nTranslation\nThe short story was translated into French by Sylvie Denis and Francis Val\u00e9ry (1997 and 2006), Hungarian by J\u00f3zsef B\u00e9k\u00e9si (1999), Romanian by Mihai-Dan Pavelescu (1999), Japanese by Makoto Yamagishi (1999), Italian by Riccardo Valla (2003) and Korean by Kim Sang-hoon (2024). The French translation appeared under the two different titles \"Le Tout P\u2019tit\" and \"Le P\u2019tit-mignon\".\nBackground\nKaren Burnham writes in Greg Egan (Modern Masters of Science Fiction), that the short story \"really marked a turning point, establishing Egan\u2019s presence as a pure SF writer.\" Egan, in an interview with Eidolon in 1993, told that \"David Pringle did help steer me away from horror; when he bought \u2018The Cutie\u2019\u2014my first SF story for Interzone\u2014he made it clear that he thought I was heading in the right direction.\" Egan also stated in this interview, that the inspiration for the short story \"was triggered by reading that childless adults in the US were buying themselves Cabbage Patch dolls - and that one couple had even had an exorcism performed on theirs.\" He added to be \"still not sure if that was apocryphal or not.\"\nReception\nReviews\nJon Evans, writing in the Reactor Magazine, claims that the short story \"is one of the the  most sentimental and emotional horror stories every   written.\"\nKaren Burnman writes in Greg Egan (Modern Masters of Science Fiction), that \"as with several of Egan\u2019s other early stories, the author\u2019s hand is obviously tipping the scales, with a narrative that at times seems manipulated instead of flowing naturally.\" As examples, she notes that it is \"difficult  to believe that there would be a market for semi-human babies who die young, or that a protagonist obsessed with child-nurturing would not simply adopt.\" She adds that \"while this is a story that lightly hits some horror buttons, it is firmly on the side of near-future, bioethics-oriented SF.\"\nAwards\nThe short story reached the 5th place in the Interzone Reader's Poll in 1990 and was nominated for the Seiun Award in 2000.\nLiterature\nBurnham, Karen (2014).

She was the great-granddaughter of Russian writer Nikolai Leskov. Her parents Yuri and Elena were descendant of the Russian imperial aristocracy. They fled Russia after the 1917 revolution. In 1922 the couple moved from Venice to Paris where they soon had a daughter. Her father worked as a translator and her mother got a job as a model in Elsa Schiaparelli's fashion house. Later, her parents got divorced.\nTatiana studied at Princess Paley's School for girls in Quincy-sous-S\u00e9nart. At the age of nine she lost her mother who died from tuberculosis. Her father decided that the young girl would begin to study ballet. In 1932 she was introduced to Lyubov Yegorova who did not work with young children, and advised Nicolas Kremnev. Having mastered the basics of classical dance thanks to him, Tatiana returned to Yegorova, with whom she studied until the age of fourteen. In 1937\u20131938, Tatiana trained with the Op\u00e9ra -comique ballet troupe, directed by Constantin Cherkas. In 1938, she was a member of Ygorova's brand new troupe, Les Ballets de la Jeunesse.\nAt the invitation of Jean-Louis Vaudoyer, she danced on the stage of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in the prologue to a play by Moli\u00e8re. In 1939, she participated in an evening commemorating the 10th anniversary of the death of Sergei Diaghilev at the Pavillon de Marsan.\nCareer\nIn 1939, Lubov Tchernicheva, ballet mistress, and Serge Grigoriev, manager of the Russian ballets of Colonel W. de Basil, hired her, with Genevi\u00e8ve Moulin, the Tupine brothers and Nina Popova. She performed with the Russian ballets of Colonel W. de Basil in Great Britain, in Australia, then in the United States (Los Angeles and San Francisco). In 1941, she made her debut, at the 51st Street Theater in New York City, in Balustrade under the direction of Stravinsky and George Balanchine, with whom she remained friends for the rest of her life. During the war, she also studied with Boris Knyazev, Yvette Chauvir\u00e9 and Zizi Jeanmaire.\nIn Buenos Aires, she wants to enter the Teatro Col\u00f3n so she can work with Balanchine, but cannot do so due to her minority. In 1945, in Rio de Janeiro, Tatiana and her friend Anna Volkova were offered a lucrative four-month contract with the Copacobana casino which had its own theater and choreographer. As de Basil refuses to grant them leave, they both leave the troop. In 1950, Leskova was hired as ballet mistress, choreographer and dancer of the ballet of the Municipal Theater of Rio, the oldest classical company in Brazil, and remained there until. She works on productions of ballets from the classical repertoire which are staged. Guest choreographers such as L\u00e9onide Massine, Dollar and Harald Lander are invited to work with company.\nLeskova became a recognized specialist in the revival of Massine 's ballets, which her son Lorca also took up, although her work was heavily criticized by artists who worked with Massine. In particular, she performed ballets by the choreographer such as Les Pr\u00e9sages, at the Paris Opera, at the invitation of Rudolf Nureyev, in 1989; Choreartium, in Birmingham in 1991; The Beautiful Danube, It also passes in England, where it is awarded, in the United States and in the Netherlands.\nIn 1985\u20131990, at the invitation of Olga Lepeshinskaya, she went to the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow.\nPersonal life\nIn Buenos Aires, she meets Lu\u00eds Honold Reis, a Brazilian aristocrat, industrialist, owner of coal mines in Rio Grande do Sul. But it was in Rio, in 1944, that their relationship began, despite Leskova's young age and the fact that Lu\u00eds was married to the French Giselle Zucco. Leskova performs in the Golden Room of the Copacabana Palace.\nLeskova lives in Rio de Janeiro, in the Ipanema district. She turned 100 in 2022.\n",
    "\nLudwig Breitenbach (12 February 1813, Erfurt \u2014 21 December 1885, Naumburg) was German classical scholar specializing on Xenophon's writings.\nHe was son of a registrator Philipp Breitenbach. In 1828\u20141833 he studied at Pforta school in Naumburg. In 1833\u20141837 he studied at Halle university. Professor Gottfried Bernhardy had the largest influence on Breitenbach. He also helped the young scholar to choose the research field (Xenophon). Breitenbach's dissertatio inauguralis was about Xenophon's Oeconomicus (Halle, 1837).\nIn 1840 Breitenbach became Inspektor at Schleusingen gymnasium. Meanwhile, he completed an edition of Oeconomicus with apparatus criticus and Latin commentaries. In 1841 it made part of Friedrich Jacobs and Valentin Rost\u00a0's Bibliotheca Graeca series (for which Raphael K\u00fchner produced Anabasis and Memorabilia, and Friedrich August Bornemann \u2014 Cyropaedia). They asked Breitenbach to prepare editions of two more minor works of Xenophon (Hiero and Agesilaus, 1846\u20131847), which was followed by 2 volumes of Hellenica (1853\u20131863, the second not a part of Bibliotheca Graeca).\nIn 1842 Breitenbach moved to Wittenberg, where he continued teaching at gymnasium. He met his wife already in Schleusingen, with whom he lived for 12 years. They had four children. She died prematurely, then he became gravely ill: he had progressing deafness. He couldn't teach anymore and in 1860 he had to leave school. In 1864 he moved to Naumburg, where he spent his last years. He married subsequently another woman, who died prior to him too. He died at his home in Naumburg in 1885.\nWritings\nBreitenbach's scholarly output may be divided into two periods. In the first he published editions of most of Xenophon's works: scholarly editions of Oeconomicus, Agesilaus, Hiero, Hellenica, and school editions of Memorabilia and Cyropaedia. To this can be added a school edition of Cornelius Nepos. In the second period, after his retirement, he was mostly occupied with new editions of the previous works. He also produced several new books: a school and a scholarly edition of Anabasis. His last work was a school edition of Hellenica.\nWhile in the first period he was mostly occupied with textual criticism, in the second he was much more interested in real and historical commentary.\nHe was a great admirer of Goethe and published a book on his poetry.\nList of writings (selection)\nEditions of classical authors\nScholarly editions\nXenophon.

    "\nSeason of television series\nThe first season of the Mexican reality television series La casa de los famosos M\u00e9xico premiered on 4 June 2023, with a live move-in on Las Estrellas. The show follows a group of celebrities who live together in a house while being constantly filmed with no communication with the outside world as they compete to win the grand prize of $4,000,000. The season is hosted by Galilea Montijo, Diego de Erice and Odalys Ram\u00edrez.\nThe season concluded on 13 August 2023, after 71 days of competition with Wendy Guevara being crowned the winner, and Nicola Porcella the runner-up.\nTwists\nDilemma\nDuring the premiere, housemates were presented with a Dilemma which consisted of making choices before entering the house. The consequences of these choices only lasted throughout Week 1. Raquel had to choose between eating only beans and rice for a week or closing the communal showers for a week; she chose the former. Sof\u00eda and Ferka had to choose who between them would lose access to their luggage for a week; they chose that Ferka would lose her luggage. Apio and Nicola had to choose who between them would sleep on a yoga mat on the floor for a week; they chose that Nicola would sleep on the floor. B\u00e1rbara and Paul had to choose between exchanging their luggage for a week or the entire house having no toothpaste for a week; they chose the former. Marie Claire and Jorge had to choose between sleeping in a bed together for a week or the entire house having no coffee for a week; they chose the former. Sergio had to choose between having no underwear for a week or the entire house having no towels and bathrobes for a week; he chose the former. Wendy and Poncho had to choose between sleeping in a bed together for a week or both of them not being able to attend the first week's party; they chose the latter. Emilio had to choose between sleeping outside for the first three nights or removing access to hot water from the other housemates for the first three days; he chose the latter.\nOn Day 9, the new housemate Barby was presented with her own Dilemma. She had to choose between keeping on her boxing gloves for the next three days or cutting off power to the laundry room for those three days; she chose the latter.\nFlash Vote\nDuring the season premiere, there was a Flash Vote whereby the public was given the opportunity to nominate one housemate to be up for eviction that week. The public had only a few minutes to vote for who they wanted to nominate. The housemate who received the most votes was nominated that week.\nHousemates\nOn Day 1, thirteen celebrity housemates (Apio, B\u00e1rbara, Emilio, Ferka, Jorge, Marie Claire, Nicola, Paul, Poncho, Raquel, Sergio, Sof\u00eda & Wendy) moved into the house. The official fourteenth housemate would move into the house at a later date. On Day 9, this housemate was revealed to be Barby.\nNominations table\nEvery week, each participant has to nominate two of their housemates, with the exception of the Head of Household who has immunity and could not be nominated; there is also no need to nominate the public Flash Vote nominee. The first person a housemate nominates is for 2 points, and the second nomination is for 1 point. At least four participants who had the highest amount of nomination points are nominated for eviction. The public is then able to vote online for who they want to save from eviction. The housemate who receives the least public votes is evicted that week.\n\u00a0 This housemate was the Head of Household, and could not be nominated.\n\u00a0 This housemate was nominated by their housemates.\n\u00a0 This housemate was nominated by the public.\n\u00a0 This housemate was immune from eviction.\n^Note 1\u00a0: On Day 1, Poncho received the most public votes from the Flash Vote, but was saved by the HoH.\n^Note 2\u00a0: On Day 9, Barby entered the house as a new housemate. She was immune from eviction and was not eligible to nominate that week.\n^Note 3\u00a0: The HoH competition was played in teams of two. Apio and Emilio won the competition and both became Heads of Household. Both had to come to an agreement on which of the nominees to save that week.\n^Note 4\u00a0: Due to announcing their intentions on who to nominate to other housemates, Ferka and Paul's points against Nicola and Sergio were annulled; Poncho and Sergio's points against Jorge were annulled.\n^Note 5\u00a0: On Day 33, Emilio won the power of adding 1 nomination point to his nominations. Therefore, the first housemate he nominates is for 3 points and the second nomination is for 2 points.\n^Note 6\u00a0: This week, each housemate was given an extra nomination. Therefore, the first housemate they nominate is for 3 points, the second nomination is for 2 points, and the third nomination is for 1 point.\n^Note 7\u00a0: On Day 47, Nicola won the power to spin a wheel that determined the amount of points given to his nominations. The results were -6 points to Jorge, 6 points to Poncho, and 5 points to Barby.\n^Note 8\u00a0: Nicola won the final competition, winning immunity from",

    "Belief that Ingush people should constitute a nation\nThe Flag of Ingushetia\nIngush nationalism is the belief that the Ingush people should constitute a nation. Ingush nationalism has been variously utilised as both a secular and Islamist concept at various times, and has become particularly important since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the 1992 East Prigorodny conflict with North Ossetia.\nHistory\nModern Ingush nationalism emerged in the mid-1950s, following the 1944 deportation of the Chechens and Ingush and Ingush being subsequently allowed to return. Much of Ingush land had been repopulated by Ossetian settlers in the period between their deportation and their return, and three days of massive violence broke out before the Soviet government restored order. Ingush nationalism continued largely among underground Sufi brotherhoods, with occasional public events such as the 1973 Grozny meeting\u00a0 strengthening public nationalist sentiments.\nAmidst Perestroika and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ingush nationalists began to publicly organise, forming organisations such as Nijsxo and the Congress of the Ingush People in an effort to secure their autonomy separately from Chechnya (which was then united with Ingushetia as the Chechen-Ingush ASSR) and retake Prigorodny District. This ultimately resulted in the establishment of modern Ingushetia in 1992. Rising Ingush and Ossetian nationalism culminated in the 1992 East Prigorodny conflict, which resulted in the ethnic cleansing of Prigorodny District's Ingush population by North Ossetian and Russian forces. As a response, Ingush nationalism and anti-Russian sentiment sharply increased, and in 1994 the region's nationalist leaders urged eventual independence.\nRuslan Aushev, the first President of Ingushetia, was elected in 1993 by a coalition of Ingush nationalist groups. An ideological secularist, he came into conflict with Islamist militant forces, which were spreading from the Middle East to the Caucasus. His 2002 removal and replacement by Murat Zyazikov led Ingush to turn to Jihadism, leading to the beginning of the insurgency in Ingushetia. Zyazikov's own removal in 2008 was met with widespread celebration among Ingush, and Caucasus experts such as Ivan Sukhov and Valery Dzutsati speculated that his replacement, Yunus-bek Yevkurov, would pursue Ingush nationalist policies to deescalate the conflict and bring stability to the republic. Yevkurov called for the return of Ingush refugees to Prigorodny District in a first for a republican leader. In response, the jihadist Caucasus Emirate declared that the Vilayat Galgayche would hold control over all of North Ossetia. Both the Caucasus Emirate and pro-Russian Ingush forces used Ingush nationalism during the insurgency in the North Caucasus.\nThe 2018 Chechnya\u2013Ingushetia border agreement was met with widespread protests in Ingushetia, amidst the formalisation of the border and rumours that Chechnya would receive much more land than publicly declared. The Ingush Independence Committee, an Ingush nationalist organisation, was formed in 2023.\n",
    "The 2004 Western Cape provincial election was held on 14 April 2004, concurrently with the 2004 South African general election, to elect the 3rd Western Cape Provincial Parliament. As of 2024, this election was the first and only time in which the African National Congress led the provincial government, as well as the most recent time that the ANC was the largest party in the Provincial Parliament. \nBackground\nMain article: 1999 Western Cape provincial election\nThe previous election resulted in no party obtaining a majority in the Provincial Parliament. The NNP formed a coalition with the smaller Democratic Party, with Morkel remaining as premier. In 2000, plans began to prepare an amalgamation of the two parties under the name Democratic Alliance. However, in 2001, the NNP leadership pulled out of its co-operation with the DA and instead sought to form a partnership with the African National Congress. Morkel was deeply critical of this decision and attempted to turn the majority of the NNP against it. When this failed, he was forced to resign as premier. He was succeeded by Peter Marais as leader of the NNP and was elected Premier of the Western Cape on 5 December 2001.\nMarais served until his resignation on 3 June 2002 amid allegations of sexual harassment. Marais was then succeeded by Marthinus van Schalkwyk as leader of the NNP and premier. During the 2003 floor-crossing period four members of the provincial parliament crossed to the ANC, giving it an absolute majority of 22 seats in the 42-seat house. However, the ANC remained in coalition with the NNP and van Schalkwyk remained as Premier heading into the 2009 provincial election.\nResults\nAftermath\nThe election resulted in a significant decline of the NNP to the third-largest party in the Provincial Parliament, with the ANC increasing its plurality of seats and the Democratic Alliance becoming the second-largest party. The ANC-NNP coalition continued in power, but a month after the election, premier Marthinus van Schalkwyk took up a ministerial post in the national cabinet. The ANC then selected MEC for Finance and Economic Ebrahim Rasool as the 5th premier of the province.  \nThe NNP was finally dissolved after the 2005 floor-crossing period and its members joined the ANC, again giving that party an absolute majority of 24 seats. In the 2007 floor-crossing period the ANC gained a further three members of the provincial parliament.   \nOn 14 July 2008, Rasool was recalled from the position of premier by the National Executive Committee of the ANC, as the ANC leadership had disapproved of him giving preference to the large Muslim and Cape Coloured populations in the Western Cape. The MEC for Economic Development and Tourism Lynne Brown was designated as his successor. Brown and the ANC were defeated by the DA in the 2009 provincial election, and Brown was succeeded by DA leader Helen Zille as premier. \n",
    "Sports season\nThe 1946 Mexican League season was the 22nd season in the history of the Mexican League (LMB). It was contested by eight teams. Alijadores de Tampico won their second consecutive title, finishing with a records of 56 wins and 41 losses, beating the runners-up, Diablos Rojos del M\u00e9xico, by one game.\nThis season was notable due to the conflict between the Mexican League, in its first year under president Jorge Pasquel, and Major League Baseball (MLB). Pasquel attempted to lure major league players to Mexico by offering higher wages, earning the ire of MLB Commissioner Happy Chandler, as the Mexican League existed outside so-called \"organized baseball.\" 22 major leaguers ended up defecting, or \"jumping\", to the Mexican League, though these players would be banned from playing in MLB-affiliated ball under Chandler's orders.\nConflict with Major League Baseball\nBefore 1946, the Mexican League drew top-level American talent from the Negro leagues, ranging from established stars like Willie Wells and Josh Gibson, as well as future prospects like Monte Irvin; as African-Americans, these players were barred from playing in Major League Baseball. However, after World War II, the league sought to recruit players from MLB itself, largely thanks to the efforts of Jorge Pasquel, owner of the Azules de Veracruz and the league's new president. The first player committing to play in Mexico was Danny Gardella, an outfielder with the New York Giants. Gardella signed an offer with Veracruz worth $3,000 more than what he would be paid in the majors. Eventually, 21 other players followed Gardella, including Sal Maglie, Max Lanier, and Alejandro Carrasquel (though some returned home soon after defecting).\nCommissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler drew a clear line between \"organized baseball,\" i.e. the minor leagues under the authority of the Commissioner, and the independent Mexican League, which was labeled an \"outlaw league.\" Pasquel offered to acquiesce to Chandler's authority providing that the Mexican League was recognized as a \"major league\" on par with MLB, but this was rejected. On April 1, Opening Day of the 1946 MLB season, Chandler announced that any player who had \"jumped\" to Mexico would be banned for five years from playing in MLB-affiliated baseball. Other MLB owners like Yankees owner Larry MacPhail took legal action to prevent their players from defecting to Mexico.\nMost of the \"jumpers\" signed with clubs owned by Pasquel and his brothers: the Azules de Veracruz (10) and the Diablos Rojos del M\u00e9xico (3). Torre\u00f3n,Nuevo Laredo, and Puebla each signed three each, while eventual league champion Tampico signed only one, Moe Franklin. However, many of them found it difficult to adjust to the Mexican League; Veracruz catcher Mickey Owen ended up returning to the United States partway through the season, only to find that Chandler's suspension wasn't a bluff.\nPasquel's efforts to lure top-level major league talent to Mexico were unsuccessful, as star players like Ted Williams and Stan Musial rebuffed his offers. Most of the MLB players that did \"jump\" to Mexico did not substantially improve their teams' performance, and Pasquel's own Azules de Veracruz, with 11 of the defectors, limped to a dismal, second-to-last place finish. Going into the 1947 season, Pasquel announced that he would no longer \"raid\" players signed to MLB contracts.\nThe conflict with MLB had ramifications beyond the Mexican League; after the 1946 season, Gardella eventually sued Major League Baseball on antitrust grounds, in what would be the biggest challenge to baseball's reserve clause since the 1920s. Chandler, faced with the prospect of a court striking down baseball's antitrust exemption, lifted the suspension of the jumpers in 1949.\nStandings\nLeague leaders\nMilestones\nBatters\nAgust\u00edn Bejerano (Nuevo Laredo): Bejerano set the Mexican League record for stolen bases, with 47; this record would later be broken by Francisco Garc\u00eda in 1966.\nNotes\n^ Alex Carrasquel and Luis Olmo played with both Veracruz and M\u00e9xico in 1946.\n",
    "American actress\nCharme Allen (born Charme Willa Wright, November 19, 1890 \u2013 October 4, 1980) was an actress in old-time radio, on television, and on the stage, as well as a pianist, best known for her long tenure as Aunt Polly on the radio serial David Harum. She was also the voice of Borden's Elsie the Cow at the 1939 World's Fair and the original narrator for the American Ballet Theatre's debut production of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. \n\u00a0\nEarly life and career\nBorn in Dayton, Ohio, Allen was the only child of Theresa Wolf and Charles A. Wright. She was performing in public as early as June 1902, when, at age 11, she was one of several piano students giving a recital at the studio of Lottie Schaeffer. By age of 16, she was listed in the Dayton business directory as a music instructor.  Her interest in acting begin to develop shortly thereafter, as she attended the O'Brien School of Elocution and Dramatic Art.  However, in deference to the steadfast opposition of her mother (who envisioned her daughter as a concert pianist), she continued her musical studies at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music while restricting her dramatic endeavors to local summer stock, initially with the Wright Huntington Players and later the Manhattan Stock Company. As she later recalled, \"I took the roles the others didn't want. They were servant and other character parts. I suspect they gave me more valuable training than the heroine got.\"\nFollowing the premature death of her mother in 1912, and a catastrophic flood which destroyed her place of employment and nearly proved fatal, Wright abruptly wed her colleague and fellow Conservatory alumnus, Joseph B. Allen, and the couple soon relocated to Buffalo, New York, where they would reside for more than 20 years.\nIn Buffalo, Allen joined the musician's union and quickly found work with local pit orchestras. Shortly thereafter, she connected with drama instructor Jane M. Keeler at the Twentieth Century Club, where she studied for approximately five years before becoming a member of Keeler's Studio Theater Players.\nIn the table below is a chronological listing of some of Allen's more notable radio roles. \nRadio\nTelevision\nTheatre\nAlthough Allen never did get to realize her \"fondest wish\" (that being to \"play on Broadway  show New York what I really can do\"), she did manage to give New York\u2014or at least its Off-Broadway contingent\u2013at least one reasonably representative sample when she appeared in a 1948 revival of Lennox Robinson's Church Street, a one-act play presented by New Stages Inc. as the opening act of a double bill with Jean-Paul Sartre's The Respectful Prostitute.  And while the critical consensus regarding the two pieces presented that night strongly favored the latter, that imbalance did not carry over into their assessment of performances, least of all as regards Allen. J.T.S. of The New Leader wrote, \"This work is given a somewhat less smooth performance, but the women especially are good, from Florida Friebus as the fluttery and starving Miss Pettigrew to the soberly sharp work of Charme Allen as Aunt Moll.\" The Hollywood Reporter's Lee Rogow devoted so much space to Sartre's play that he had scarcely a paragraph left for Church Street, which he judged, in closing, \"an overlong but interesting curtain-raiser  was illuminated by beautiful performances by Florida Friebus, Charme Allen, and Gertrude Corey.\" Similarly, Women's Wear Daily critic Thomas R. Dash, leaving himself little space to discuss Church Street, made sure to acknowledge the \"superb portrayal by Charme Allen of the cantankerous yet highly intelligent Aunt Moll.\" Even the Times' Brooks Atkinson, who, alone among these critics, judged Church Street's presentation as harshly as he did the work being presented, exempted exactly one participant from this critique. \"'Church Street' turns out to be more charade than drama, and with the exception of Charme Allen's acting, the performance is typical of most non-commercial productions; the characters are always just sliding out of the actors' grasp.\"\nPersonal life and death\nIn Dayton, Ohio, on April 7, 1913, prompted by their harrowing experience in that season's well-publicized flood, Charme Wright and her then employer, saxophonist/clarinetist and bandleader Joseph Brown Allen, were married. Their union produced one child, radio actress Willa Gene Allen, and lasted until her husband's death on June 9, 1962.\nOn October 4, 1980, Allen died following a long illness at age 89, at the Actor's Fund Home in Englewood, New Jersey, where she had moved ten years prior. Allen's remains are interred at the Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum, in Dayton, Ohio.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n",
    "Municipal building in Paignton, Devon, England\nThe Old Town Hall is a former municipal building in New Street in Paignton, a town in Devon, in England. It served as the offices of Paignton Urban District Council until 1946, but was later converted for residential use.\nHistory\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with its status as a seaside resort, a local board was formed in Paignton in 1863. In 1867, the local decided to commission a building to serve as a public office, police station, sessions house and assembly room. The site selected was on the north side of New Street. The new building was designed by John Tarring in the Italianate style, built in stone and was completed in 1870. As well as being the location for weekly petty session hearings, the town hall also served as the meeting place for the local masonic lodge.\nAfter the local board was succeeded by Paignton Urban District Council in 1894, the town hall became the offices and meeting place of the new council. During the Second World War, it operated as the local sub-station for the purposes of controlling air raid precautions against German bombing. The town hall continued to serve as the council headquarters for over half a century, but ceased to be the local seat of government when the council relocated to Oldway Mansion in 1946.\nAs well as being used for municipal purposes it also served as a public events venue: the rock band, the Gods, performed there in November 1967. The town hall was kept in public ownership, serving as the local register office and being used for the provision of local services, including council rent and rates collection, by the urban district council until 1968, and then by Torbay Council thereafter. It remained in public ownership until 2008, when it was deemed surplus to requirements, and sold to a developer for conversion into housing.\nArchitecture\nThe building is constructed of grey limestone and red sandstone, with yellow sandstone dressings.  The left-hand section of three bays is slightly projected forward from the right-hand section of two bays. The left-hand section, which is also taller than the right-hand section, is fenestrated with segmental-headed windows with multi-coloured sandstone voussoirs on the ground floor, and with round-headed windows with voussoirs on the first floor. The first bay in the right-hand section contains a doorway on the ground floor and a narrow casement window with an architrave on the first floor, while the second bay is fenestrated by a segmental headed casement window with voussoirs on the ground floor and by a square headed casement window with an architrave on the first floor. An attic storey lit by Velux windows has been inserted to create extra space. Internally, the principal room is the former council chamber on the ground floor, behind the segmental-headed windows. Torbay Council has described the building as being part of an \"eccentric terrace\".\n",
    "Kabbalist and author, brother of the Vilna Gaon\nRabbi Avraham ben Solomon, (5482 / 1722\u20134 Nisan 5564 / 16 March 1804), also known as Abraham Ragoler (or Abraham of Ragola) was the brother of Elijah, the Vilna Gaon. He was a Kabbalist and darshan (preacher), and author of the book Ma'alot HaTorah.\nBiography\nAvraham was born in 5482 (1722) to Rabbi Shlomo Zalman and Traina. He was the third of five boys, His elder brothers were Rabbi Elijah, the Vilna Gaon (b. 1720) and Rabbi Moshe. His younger brothers were Rabbi Yissachar Dov (author of Tzuf Devash on Torah) and Rabbi Meir.\nWhile he was still young, he was appointed preacher of Shklow where many famous Torah scholars lived, including many students of his brother. Later, due to disputes between Hasidim and Misnagdim, Avraham moved to Ariogala (Ragola), after which he became known as Avraham Ragoler. His brother, the Vilna Gaon described him as, \"A soul without a body\" because of his ascetic lifestyle, separating him from anything physical.\nHe married Hinda Ragoler, who passed away c. 1758 and then Roise Hasid. He had three sons, including Elijah Magid-Ragoler.\nIn his final years, he moved to Neustadt- Sugint (\u017demai\u010di\u0173 Naumiestis) where his son, Rabbi Elijah, served as head of the beth din. He passed away on 4 Nisan 5564 (16 March 1804).\nWritings\nRabbi Avraham wrote many books, including a kabbalistic commentary on Masechet Megillah, the  Book of Esther a commentary on the Torah, a commentary on the siddur and on the Passover haggadah. However, these have all remained only in manuscript. His only published books are a commentary on Pirkei Avot and the book for which he is best known, Ma'alot HaTorah, which was first printed in 5584 (1824) by his grandson, Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh, and republished seven times in the following 70 years, and subsequently many times more. He even instructed his family to learn the book at least once a month.\nMa'alot HaTorah\nThe book Ma'alot HaTorah speaks about greatness and great praise of the Torah and those who learn it.  It contains many teachings from the author's brother, the Vilna Gaon. The author cites many words of Chazal from the Talmud and Midrashim and quotes from the Zohar which speak of the value of Torah and its importance.\nIn the introduction, the author explains the purpose of his essay. He writes  that the central path to do repentance is through studying the Torah, and especially nowadays, when fasting and afflictions are less suitable for the majority of the public. For this reason, he wrote his essay which is intended to lead the reader to Torah study, repentance and good and honest behavior.\n\"The whole point of the protection of repentance is solely through the Torah that elevates... and especially in these generations, because the length of the exile is because of not learning Torah, may the Merciful one protect us, and the exiles gather solely in the merit of the Torah... The Torah also atones for everything... For self-affliction and fasts were for the earlier generations, but the later ones have a weak temperament. The essence repentance is to through strengthening Torah learning all day long... Therefore, I raised my hand in this composition with these words, because my desire is to clarify here, to the best of my knowledge, the virtues of the Torah, as found in the Scriptures and words of the Sages, in the Talmud and Midrashim and words of the Holy Zohar... to awaken the reader from the slumber of time, and to bring to his heart closer to the devotion of the Holy Torah, so that through this they may come to complete repentance, and to all the elevated virtues, and to good and honest behavior, and on this I have founded this book.\"\nDescendants\nSon, Rabbi Eliyahu, head of the beit din of Neustadt- Sugint. His descendants include Rabbi Yonah Reem and his brother, Rabbi Eliyahu Re'em, and Rabbi Raphael Yonah Tikuchinsky.\nSon, Rabbi Gershon, author of \"Avodat Hagershuni.\"\nSon, Rabbi Shmuel (known as \"Rabbi Shmuel Hakatan), head of the beit din of \u0160\u0117ta.\nGrandson, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman, author of \"Beit Avot,\" head of the beit din of Neustadt- Sugint.\nGrandson, Rabbi Meir, author of the \"Nachalat Avot.\"\nGrandson, Rabbi Yissachar Ber of Bir\u017eai, also known as the Magid of Rotova.\nGreat-grandson, Rabbi Meir Michel Rabinovitz, author of \"Hameir Laolam.\"\nGreat-grandson, Rabbi Eliyahu Baruch Kammai.\nGreat-grandson, Rabbi Eliyahu Loiznon.\nFurther reading\nMa'alot HaTorah\n",
    "Musical artist\nCongolese rumba musician (1951\u20131996)\nZ\u00e9phyrin-Alexandre Matima Mpioso (14 April 1951 \u2013 26 May 1996), known professionally as Mbuta Matima, was a prominent Congolese guitarist, arranger, music director and songwriter, best known for his influential work with Za\u00efko Langa Langa, one of the most famous and enduring bands of Congolese rumba.\nBorn in Sona-Bata, a town in the Bas-Congo Province, Matima began his musical career in 1968, debuting with Orchestre Stukas. In 1969, he joined Za\u00efko Langa Langa, initially as part of their pop section, performing as a concert opener alongside singers Mbuta Mashakado and Pierre Nkumu. Matima's transition to the band's main Congolese rumba section came in 1973 when singer Gina wa Gina Efonge encouraged him to play the guitar in place of the band's lead guitarist, F\u00e9lix Manuaku Waku. Matima's first guitar solos featured in Efonge's song \"BP Ya Munu,\" released in December 1973. His own first composition for Za\u00efko Langa Langa, \"Ngeli Ngeli\" (later versioned as \"Kin Kiesse\"), was recorded for the band's 1976 LP Plaisir de l'Ouest Afrique. In late 1976, he released another classic hit, \"Toli Kulumpe,\" which was reversioned in 1977 and again in 1982. In 1978, Matima was part of Tout Grand Libanko, a nzonzing band by Gina wa Gina parallel to his career in Za\u00efko Langa Langa.\nFollowing Manuaku's departure in 1980, Matima assumed greater responsibilities within the band as the artistic director and arranger. He played a crucial role in song composition and arrangement, significantly shaping the band's musical direction. One of his notable compositions, \"Masela,\" appeared on Za\u00efko Langa Langa's 1984 LP On Gagne Le Proc\u00e8s. He also released classics like \"Kabobo\" and \"Mena,\" which featured on the albums Tala Mod\u00e8le Echanger (1985) and Pusa Kuna\u2026 Serrez! Serrez! (1986), respectively. Matima's skills as an arranger shone in the album Nippon Banzai, considered Za\u00efko Langa Langa's most successful and popular record.\nIn May 1988, a split within Za\u00efko Langa Langa led to the formation of Za\u00efko Langa Langa Familia Dei. Matima chose to remain with the original band. They released the LP Jetez l'Eponge in 1989. In Za\u00efko Langa Langa's 1991 LP Jamais sans Nous, Matima composed his final song for the band, \"Reviens Hyppau,\" and played lead guitar on \"Videma.\"\nIllness and death\nStarting from 1992, Matima's health began to deteriorate, which forced him to stop playing guitar. He relocated to Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, where he spent his remaining years. Mbuta Matima passed away on May 26, 1996, at the age of 45.\nReferences list\n^ Stewart, Gary (22 July 2009). \"Rumba on the River\". rumbaontheriver.com.

    "New Zealand scholar and editor (born 1943)\nReina Ann Whaitiri (born 1943) is a New Zealand scholar, poet, essayist, editor and researcher. She taught English literature at the University of Auckland and at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa for many years, and has co-edited several notable anthologies of Polynesian writing, including Whetu Moana: Contemporary Polynesian Poems in English (2003), which received the Reference and Anthology award in the 2004 Montana New Zealand Book Awards.\nEarly life, education and family\nWhaitiri was born in 1943 and is of K\u0101i Tahu and P\u0101keh\u0101 descent. Her father Bob Whaitiri was part of the M\u0101ori Battalion. She grew up in Rotorua, attended St Mary's Diocesan School, Stratford and subsequently St Hilda's Collegiate School in Dunedin. After having a son during a short early marriage, she spent time travelling overseas and learning languages, including four years in Germany. On returning to New Zealand, she obtained her bachelor's and master's degrees in arts at the University of Auckland, followed by a teaching diploma. She has been the partner of New Zealand writer Albert Wendt since the early 1990s.\nCareer\nWhaitiri taught English literature at the University of Auckland for fourteen years and as an assistant professor at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa for four years, until her retirement in 2008. Together with Linda Tuhiwai Smith she edited a journal of M\u0101ori women's writing, Te Pua, published in three volumes between 1992 and 1994.\nTogether with Albert Wendt and Robert Sullivan, Whaitiri co-edited the poetry anthologies Whetu Moana: Contemporary Polynesian Poems in English (2003, Auckland University Press) and Mauri Ola: Contemporary Polynesian Poems in English (2010, Auckland University Press). Whetu Moana was notable as being the first anthology of contemporary Polynesian poetry in English to have Polynesian editors. In reviewing Whetu Moana for the New Zealand Review of Books, Cilla McQueen compared the anthology to a moving waka, and said, \"Pacific rhythms underlie the language giving aural cohesion to the whole with their beat and energy\". The British Review of New Zealand Studies said it \"represents an important addition to the field of Pacific literature\", and World Literature Today called it an \" exciting, varied, carefully produced anthology, with a wealth of recent poetry illustrating concerns of present Polynesia, with political and cultural overtones\".\nWhetu Moana received the Reference and Anthology award at the 2004 Montana New Zealand Book Awards. The judge's comments called it a \"substantial, important and historically significant book\". Before the ceremony, The Press described it as likely to be \"clear winner\" of its category, noting that it \"breaks new ground by energetically exploring the new voices of the Pacific\". Iain Sharp writing in the Sunday Star-Times also predicted it as a winner, describing it as \"innovative\" and \"big-selling\".\nWhaitiri and Sullivan co-edited Puna Wai K\u014drero: An Anthology of M\u0101ori Poetry in English (2014). Anahera Gildea, reviewing the anthology for the New Zealand Review of Books, said it \"is not only a short course in recent M\u0101ori political and social history, it is also a short course in poetry itself\"; her review concluded: \"This is a work of history; a collection of cultural pioneers who have been forced to bestride two radically different cultures.\" It received the Creative Writing (Te Tuhinga Auaha) award at the Ng\u0101 Kupu Ora M\u0101ori Book Awards in 2015.\nWhaitiri has contributed essays to several publications, including an essay about her childhood for Growing Up M\u0101ori (edited by Witi Ihimaera, 1998, Tandem Press), an essay about M\u0101ori literature for State of the Maori Nation: twenty-first century issues in Aotearoa (2006, Reed) an essay about the struggles of Polynesian women for Whispers and Vanities: Samoan Indigenous Knowledge and Religion (2014, Huia Publishers), and an essay on Pacific Island fairy tales for Folktales and Fairy Tales: Traditions and Texts from Around the World (2016, Greenwood).\n",

    "2024 studio album by Zach Top\nCold Beer & Country Music is the second studio album by American country music singer Zach Top. It was released on April 5, 2024, via Leo33. It includes the single \"Sounds Like the Radio\", which was released as Top's debut single to country radio on January 8, 2024.\nContent\nIn September 2023, it was announced that he was signed as the flagship artist for the newly-formed independent record label Leo33. Cold Beer & Country Music marks Top's first release under the label, and his first marketed as country music, following years of recording as a bluegrass performer.\nTop co-wrote all of the album's 12 tracks with Carson Chamberlain, who also solely produced the album. Top began a working relationship with Chamberlain in 2019, regularly flying to Nashville on a monthly basis to write songs with him and others, including Wyatt McCubbin, Roger Springer, Paul Overstreet, Michael White, Mark Nesler, and Tim Nichols. After five years of songwriting, they put together a cohesive project, with Top saying: \"It's just fun to get these songs to finally see the light of day and let people hear what I've been working on for a while. You only get one chance to make that first impression and we wanted to get it right\".\nTop named the title track, \"There's the Sun\", and \"Cowboys Like Me Do\" as some of his favorite songs on the record in an interview with Billboard. In another with American Songwriter, he also cited \"Use Me\".\nCritical reception\nIn a review for Holler, Soda Canter described the album as finding \"Top soaring through an array of diverse and intriguing song selections. It's material that triumphantly succeeds in representing his rural Washington upbringing and natural sentimentality, while propelling his exceptional artistic range front and center\", and gave the album a 9.5 out of 10 ranking. Will Chapman of Country Central called the album \"a masterclass in traditional country music\", praising Top's vocals, the neo-traditional production choices, and the diversity of material from slow jams to honkytonk rockers. Roughstock writer Matt Bjorke praised the singer for his genuine approach to 90s country music and favorably compared him to the likes of Randy Travis, Keith Whitley, and Joe Diffie, citing his background in bluegrass music and unique vocal phrasing as elements that make him a standout in the modern country genre.\nTrack listing\n",
    "\nThe School of African Heritage (\u00c9cole du Patrimoine Africain, EPA) is a graduate-level institution dedicated to the conservation of cultural heritage. It was established on November\u00a011,\u00a01998\u00a0(1998-11-11) by professionals from the University of Abomey-Calavi and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM). Located in Porto-Novo, Benin, it caters to professionals already working in the cultural heritage sector.\nActivities\nTo address the need for conservation, EPA has developed several types of activities: training (both diploma and non-diploma), consulting, mediation, information, and rehabilitation. It covers all types of heritage: museum collections, libraries and archives, built heritage, and intangible heritage.\nMore than 700 African heritage professionals from 38 countries have participated in EPA's activities (training, seminars, workshops, etc.)\nOver 220 activities organized in 13 years in training, mediation, rehabilitation, and performing arts.\nMore than 40 partners worldwide have supported its activities and/or operations.\nActivity area\nEPA's regional school activities benefit 26 countries in Francophone, Lusophone, and Hispanic Sub-Saharan Africa.\n20 Francophone countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Comoros, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritius, Mauritania, Niger, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Senegal, Chad, Togo.\n6 Lusophone and Hispanic countries: Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\nEPA has a branch in Libreville, Gabon, which supports the implementation of EPA's activities in Central Africa.\nThe Center for Heritage Development in Africa (CHDA), a sister institution to EPA established in 2000 and based in Mombasa, Kenya, develops activities for Anglophone countries.\nVision\nSince its inception in 1998, EPA has aimed to become a reference center and a cultural awakening for institutions, heritage professionals, communities, and cultural actors on the continent. EPA regularly adapts its vision and mission to meet the evolving needs expressed on the ground, with a view to sustainable development. Over 13 years, EPA has become a true platform for consultation and reference for cultural practitioners and African communities.\nGiven the numerous growth challenges faced by the African continent, reflected in socio-political, identity, and economic crises, EPA is more convinced than ever of the key role cultural heritage plays in economic and social development. Beyond its role as a catalyst for new economic sectors in Africa, cultural heritage, in its material and intangible components, is also a reliable source of creativity, mutual discovery, identity affirmation, pride, national cohesion, and brand image. By preserving and enhancing all heritage components, EPA contributes to improving communities' living conditions and fostering fruitful dialogue among peoples.\nIn the coming years, EPA's major challenge will be to integrate cultural heritage and its conservation as a priority for African countries, including incorporating it into school curricula and demonstrating its vital role in developing policies.\nObjectives\nEPA has four main objectives:\nStrengthen the network of African professionals capable of ensuring the conservation and enhancement of cultural heritage.\nImplement programs that enable the discovery and reappropriation of cultural heritage for African audiences.\nPromote socio-economic development projects that integrate the safeguarding and enhancement of cultural heritage.\nContribute to the publication and dissemination of specialized works on African cultural heritage.\nFunding\nEPA is one of the few cultural institutions that meet the challenge of self-financing. Not being directly supported by any country or institution, it must find funding sources each year to cover its operating budget.\nEPA has established two means to cover its operating budget, approximately 150,000 euros per year: percentages taken from the budgets of activities organized by EPA (66%) and interest produced by the EPA Fund (34%).\n",

It is set in a universe where most of the superpowered individuals are portrayed as corrupt individuals instead of being the heroes that the general public believes they are. The episode was written by Craig Rosenberg and directed by Steve Boyum.   \nThe episode follows the Boys attempting to deliver Kimiko's brother Kenji to the CIA after capturing him in the previous episode, \"Proper Preparation and Planning\". However, the mission becomes more complicated than originally thought when the Seven starts to pursue them with the same intentions of capturing Kenji, with Stormfront revealing that her personal character does not match the virtuous superheroine she portrays herself as to others. Meanwhile, Annie January manages to leak the truth about the Compound-V to a news station, finally exposing its existence and the truth of how the superheroes (Supes) are actually born.\n\"Over the Hill with the Swords of a Thousand Men\" was released on the streaming service Amazon Prime Video on September 4, 2020. The episode received critical acclaim from critics, who praised the performances, action sequences, writing, pacing, visual effects, storyline, and the reveal of Stormfront's true self.\nPlot\nThe Boys take a captured Kenji while sailing on a stolen yacht through the ocean, intending to deliver it to Billy Butcher's mentor, Grace Mallory. Butcher attempts to apologize to Hughie Campbell for his behavior, but Hughie still angrily punches him before Mother's Milk interferes. Kimiko consoles Kenji, with the latter asking her to free him, though the former tearfully refuses but assures him that she will protect him from his captors. Frenchie later approaches Kenji, with the latter revealing that Kimiko's muteness is a result of trauma from her parents being killed and her being kidnapped by the Shining Light Liberation Army, so he and Kimiko created their own sign language to communicate with each other. When Frenchie asks Kenji to teach him, the latter angrily refuses.\nMeanwhile, Annie January delivers the vial of Compound-V to a news channel, successfully exposing the truth about the creation of Supes, much to her and the Boys (except for Butcher's) joy, but also to the shock of Ashley, Queen Maeve, Black Noir, and the Deep, who were completely unaware of its existence leaving them devastated upon learning the revelation. Knowing that Annie is responsible, A-Train angrily confronts her.\nDuring a visit to his son, Homelander decides to train Ryan to use and control his powers. When Homelander attempts to teach Ryan how to fly, he pushes him off the roof of his house in an unsuccessful attempt. When Becca arrives, she confronts Homelander over his actions. Homelander retaliates by criticizing Becca for the way she is raising Ryan, going so far as to forcefully grab her, causing Ryan to defend her and make Homelander leave.\nSoon, a police helicopter finds the Boys and attempts to stop the yacht and arrest them. Kenji manages to free himself and uses his powers to accidentally crash the helicopter, to the dismay of Hughie. During their escape, the Boys flee on a smaller boat but are pursued by the Deep (in an attempt to be reinstated to the Seven), with him using a whale to block the Boys' route. However, Butcher rams the boat into the whale, killing it instantly and leaving the Deep devastated, while the Boys are forced to continue on foot through the sewers. A traumatized Hughie refuses to leave and insists on staying in the whale until MM convinces him to go with them.\nIntending to restore Vought's reputation and the public's trust after the exposure of the Compound-V, CEO Stan Edgar orders the Seven to capture Kenji. The Seven find the Deep, who tells them that the Boys have entered the sewers. The Deep attempts to apologize to Annie for sexually harassing her, but is rebuffed. While the Boys and Kenji continue through the sewers, they are chased by the Seven. Annie finds Hughie, and soon Homelander arrives. To ensure Annie's loyalty to the Seven, Homelander orders her to kill Hughie, threatening to kill both of them if she refuses. However, Butcher distracts Homelander, and Kenji submerges him under the sewers, allowing Kenji to run and Kimiko to follow him. Butcher helps Hughie up, regaining his trust.\nStormfront chases the siblings towards an apartment building filled with African Americans. Stormfront soon starts to kill many civilians around her and destroys the building in the process, revealing her racist true nature. The siblings arrive on the roof where they are confronted by Stormfront. Kimiko attempts to fight her bu",

    "The 1999 Western Cape provincial election was held on 2 June 1999, concurrently with the 1999 South African general election, to elect the 2nd Western Cape Provincial Parliament.\nThe election resulted in no overall control of the Provincial Parliament, but brought the African National Congress to a plurality of seats at the expense of the New National Party, as well as gains for the Democratic Party. Despite the result, the NNP formed a coalition with the DP, and incumbent Gerald Morkel remained premier. \nBackground\nMain article: 1994 Western Cape provincial election\nIn the previous election, the National Party gained the majority of seats in the 1st Western Cape Provincial Parliament, with Hernus Kriel, who previously served as the Minister of Law and Order in the South African government under Frederik Willem de Klerk, becoming the first premier of the new province. Kriel served as premier and provincial leader of the National Party until 1998, when he was succeeded by Gerald Morkel, who led the party in the 1999 provincial election. \nResults\nAftermath\nThe election resulted in no party obtaining a majority in the Provincial Parliament. The NNP formed a coalition with the smaller Democratic Party, with Morkel remaining as premier. In 2000, plans began to prepare an amalgamation of the two parties under the name Democratic Alliance. However, in 2001, the NNP leadership pulled out of its co-operation with the DA and instead sought to form a partnership with the African National Congress. Morkel was deeply critical of this decision and attempted to turn the majority of the NNP against it. When this failed, he was forced to resign as premier. He was succeeded by Peter Marais as leader of the NNP and was elected Premier of the Western Cape on 5 December 2001. \nMarais served until his resignation on 3 June 2002 amid allegations of sexual harassment. Marais was then succeeded by Marthinus van Schalkwyk as leader of the NNP and premier. During the 2003 floor-crossing period four members of the provincial parliament crossed to the ANC, giving it an absolute majority of 22 seats in the 42-seat house. However, the ANC remained in coalition with the NNP and van Schalkwyk remained as Premier heading into the 2009 provincial election.\n",
    "2006 murder of a club security officer in Singapore\nOn 25 April 2006, at a playground in Ang Mo Kio, Singapore, 26-year-old Jagagevan Jayaram brought along a chopper and wanted to seek revenge on 26-year-old Sadayan Ajmeershah over a previous dispute, but it ended with Jagagevan being killed by Sadayan and his two friends who retaliated against Jagagevan's attack. Sadayan and his two friends, Arull Wanan Thangarasu and Melvin Mathenkumar Segaram, were all arrested and charged with murder; Arull was the brother-in-law of the victim. Utlimately, the charges of murder against the trio were reduced: both Melvin and Arull were convicted of causing hurt with dangerous weapons and each of them were jailed for four years with caning (eight strokes for each man), while Sadayan was convicted of the most serious charge of manslaughter, and sentenced to nine years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane despite the prosecution's urgings for the maximum sentence of life imprisonment in Sadayan's case.\nFatal stabbing\nOn 25 April 2006, the body of a 26-year-old bouncer was found riddled with stab wounds at a playground in Ang Mo Kio. The victim, 26-year-old Jagagevan Jayaram, was pronounced dead an hour later in hospital. It was believed that, based on witness accounts, Jagagevan was attacked by a group of five or six people and therefore killed on the scene where his body was found; it was subsequently confirmed that only three people were involved in the murder.\nBased on the investigations and later sources, it was revealed that Jagagevan never knew any of his attackers, but on the date of his murder, Jagagevan and one of his attackers, identified as Sadayan Ajmeershah, were involved in a dispute between Sadayan's friend and Jagagevan's sister during that morning. Sadayan, who went to Jagagevan's flat to act as mediator, allegedly spat on the ground out of anger due to Jagagevan's sister verbally abusing him, but Sadayan apologized before he left the flat. Jagagevan, who was present at the flat, was angered at this and hence, he later went with four men to Sadayan's flat, where they assaulted him by punching, kicking and even used kitchen utensils to beat up Sadayan. As a result of the assault, Sadayan suffered multiple injuries on his head, face and abdomen. Jagagevan and his friends fled before the police and ambulance arrived.\nDespite the severity of his injuries, Sadayan declined to go to the hospital until he finished clearing away the mess and bloodstains in the flat. By nightfall, Sadayan's friends came to bring him to the hospital. When they passed by a nearby provision shop, the group spotted Jagagevan and his friends going after them, but a passing police car caused Jagagevan and his friends to disappear. However, Jagagevan was undeterred and still bent on harming Sadayan to satisfy his thirst for vengeance, and hence together with one of his friends, Jagagevan armed himself with a chopper and went to search for Sadayan. Sadayan was said to have seen Jagagevan and panicked when he saw Jagagevan accidentally dropping his chopper, and out of fear that Jagagevan would once again attack him, Sadayan went home to get a kitchen knife and returned to join his friends.\nSubsequently, a confrontation took place between Jagagevan and Sadayan nearby the playground where Jagagevan met his end. Sadayan's two friends - Melvin Mathenkumar Segaram and Arull Wanan Thangarasu (the brother-in-law of Jagagevan) - joined in during the confrontation. Jagagevan, who swung the chopper at Sadayan's neck, was stabbed 11 times by Sadayan on the neck and abdomen, and Jagagevan died as a result of the stabbing. The trio fled the scene after they finished assaulting the deceased. At the time of his death, Jagagevan, the eldest of three children, was survived by his mother and two siblings. His family described him as a man who loved his family and they noted that he tried his best to change his ways after his release from prison in February of that same year. Jagagevan was previously jailed four times for offences like theft and fighting (including reformative training).\nCriminal charges\nIn less than half a day after the murder, the three attackers, aged between 23 and 26, surrendered themselves to the police for having caused the death of Jagagevan. Sadayan's sister, whose husband Arull was among the killers, contacted her husband upon finding out what happened and persuaded him to turn himself in to the police. The three suspects - Melvin Mathenkumar Segaram, Sadayan Ajmeershah and Arull Wanan Thangarasu - were charged with murder on 27 April 2006. If found guilty of murder, the trio would be given the death penalty under Section 302 of the Penal Code of Singapore.\nPrior to the incident, one of the alleged attackers, Melvin, was previously convicted of rioting back in 2001. On 28 August 2000, Melvin and at least nine other men attacked a group of seven men and inflicted violence while being part of an unlawful assembly. Melvin, who was then 18 y",

    "Hoax Wikipedia article that claimed Alan MacMasters was the inventor of the toaster\nThe photoshopped image of Alex purported to be of Alan MacMasters\nArchive of the Alan MacMasters Wikipedia article\nThe Alan MacMasters hoax was a hoax article on Wikipedia that claimed that photography and ICT student Alan MacMasters was the inventor of the electric toaster.\nOrigin\nOn 6 February 2012, photography and ICT student Alan MacMasters was at a university lecture where the class was warned not to use Wikipedia as a source. Additionally, the lecturer pointed out that his friend, Maddy Kennedy, had edited the Wikipedia article about toasters, falsely claiming she was the inventor.\nAfter the lecture, Alan and his friends visited the toaster article on Wikipedia, where one of his friends, Alex, edited the article to replace Maddy Kennedy's name with Alan MacMasters, claiming he invented the toaster in Edinburgh in 1893.\nA year later, Alex contemplated the extent to which he could escalate the prank. In February 2013, he created an article dedicated to Alan MacMasters, including an image of himself photoshopped to resemble a 19th century photograph, and published it on Wikipedia.\nIn the article, Alex mentioned that the product was not commercially successful. He also attributed the invention of the electric kettle to MacMaster and suggested that the toaster had contributed to one of Britain\u2019s earliest fatal appliance fires. One fabricated anecdote recounted a woman whose kitchen table caught fire after the toaster's heating elements melted.\nAlex intended the article as a jest; however, newspapers, encyclopedias, government agencies, and the Hagley Museum and Library in Delaware perpetuated the false story of MacMasters as the inventor, where Alex then used these articles citing MacMaster as the inventor of the toaster to further propagate the false information. Moreover, a primary school dedicated a day to MacMasters, and he was nominated to appear on a \u00a350 note at the request of the Bank of England. During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Scottish Government-funded organizations cited Alan\u2019s story as evidence of how an independent Scotland could succeed.\nDiscovery\nIn July 2022, a 15-year-old Redditor named Adam posted an explanation, revealing that the photo on the Alan MacMasters Wikipedia page was fake. This discovery was prompted after his teacher spoke about MacMasters in class. However, he was unaware that the entire article itself was a hoax. Adam reported his concern on the Internet forum Wikipediocracy, where users discovered the article\u2019s fraudulent nature and alerted Wikipedia administrators, who promptly marked the page for deletion. Alex\u2019s Wikipedia account, which he used to perpetrate the hoax, was subsequently blocked from the platform.\nAlex anonymously told Wikipediocracy that he initially thought the prank wouldn\u2019t cause much harm. He described the first time he realized the prank was harmful was when he read a book about Victorian inventors and found Alan MacMasters listed as one of the inventors.\nThe inventor credited with the creation of the electric toaster is Charles Strite. Working as a manufacturer in Stillwater, Strite observed that workers often received burnt toast during breaks. This inspired him to develop an appliance capable of toasting bread evenly, thus addressing the issue of burnt toast.\nSee also\nArchived article and Deletion discussion on Wikipedia\nCharles Strite\nCitogenesis\nList of hoaxes on Wikipedia\n",

    "\nMonarch Casino Resort Spa is a casino resort in Black Hawk, Colorado. It is owned and operated by Monarch Casino & Resort Inc. The property includes a 64,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (5,900\u00a0m2) casino and a 23-story hotel tower with 516 rooms.\nThe casino opened on February 4, 2000, as the Riviera Black Hawk, and originally lacked a hotel. It was developed by Riviera Holdings, which also owned the Riviera hotel-casino in Las Vegas. In 2012, the Riviera Black Hawk was sold to Monarch, which rebranded it the following year. A renovation and expansion began in 2015, and eventually concluded in 2022, after construction delays. The $442 million project included the addition of hotel rooms and more casino space, both debuting in November 2020.\nHistory\nEarly years (2000\u20132012)\nThe resort began as the Riviera Black Hawk, and was the second gaming property by Riviera Holdings, which also owned and operated the Riviera hotel-casino in Las Vegas. Construction on the Black Hawk location was underway in 1998. It had a soft opening on February 4, 2000, with an official grand opening the following month. The Riviera Black Hawk cost $75 million. The casino featured table games, 1,000 slot machines, a 490-seat entertainment venue, a buffet, and a coffee shop. Unlike its Las Vegas counterpart, the Black Hawk property lacked a hotel.\nRiviera Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010, and announced a year later that it would sell the Riviera Black Hawk to focus on its Las Vegas property. The Black Hawk location was sold to Monarch Casino & Resort Inc., owner of the Atlantis Casino Resort in Reno, Nevada. The $76 million sale was finalized in April 2012. Monarch also bought 1.5 acres of vacant land, just east of the Riviera, for future development. With 988 rooms in Black Hawk, Monarch considered the local hotel market to be in need of expansion. This was a primary factor in purchasing the Riviera, which was among the largest casinos in Black Hawk at the time, with 750 slot machines.\nName changes and expansion (2013\u2013present)\nNew parking garage in 2017\nThe property was renamed the Monarch Casino Black Hawk in October 2013. A $295 million renovation and expansion was launched in 2015, starting with a new, nine-story parking garage on the property's east side. After its completion, the existing garage was imploded in December 2016, making way for a hotel tower. The expansion project also included additional casino space.\nThe renovation and expansion, when originally announced, was expected to conclude by the end of 2017. However, it would go on to be disrupted by construction delays. The 23-story tower was eventually topped off in January 2019, and work on the overall property was expected to finish later in the year. The tower was designed by MBA Architecture and Interior Design, and built by PCL Construction.\nConstruction of the hotel tower\nMonarch's relationship with PCL deteriorated due to the delays, and the contractor sued Monarch later in 2019, citing breach of contract and other issues. The suit concerned cost overruns brought on by problems encountered during construction. PCL alleged that Monarch repeatedly declined to approve a guaranteed maximum price, and Monarch called the suit \"an attempt to deflect attention from  failures to deliver the completed project in a timely and cost appropriate manner.\" Monarch later sued PCL in 2023, over hotel defects, and PCL subsequently stated that the expansion project \"went off the rails\" due to micromanagement.\nThe 2019 opening of the new facilities was eventually delayed until the following year, with the new casino space opening on November 19, 2020. The hotel portion began a phased opening starting six days later. The property, renamed Monarch Casino Resort Spa, includes 516 rooms. It competes against the 536-room Ameristar Black Hawk. The Monarch is the first gaming property encountered by motorists entering from the city's south side. It is the area's second high-end resort after Ameristar, which originally opened in 2001 and added a hotel in 2009.\nThe existing casino structure remained in operation throughout the expansion project, and was renovated thereafter. Casino space was nearly doubled with the 35,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (3,300\u00a0m2) addition, for a total of 64,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (5,900\u00a0m2). The casino has 1,100 slot machines and a sportsbook.

    "1999 unsolved murder of a ganglord in Singapore\nOn 5 May 1999, 43-year-old seaman Aw Teck Boon (\u533a\u5fb7\u6587 \u014cu D\u00e9w\u00e9n), alias Singapore Siao (\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u7b11 x\u012bn ji\u0101 p\u014d xi\u00e0o), was found murdered at Geylang after drinking at a nearby coffee shop. Aw was infamously known to be a triad leader of Sio Kun Tong and had spent time in prison for his gangland activities. It was speculated that Aw was attacked and stabbed to death while he was sleeping at a Wushu association club, likely due to unsettled underworld conflicts. Although the police managed to identify a man named Chew Tse Meng (\u5468\u5fd7\u660e Zh\u014du Zh\u00ecm\u00edng) as the prime suspect, Chew was never caught and is still at large despite extensive investigations and search efforts. A coroner's inquiry recorded a verdict of murder in 2002 after hearing the case of Aw's death. As of 2024, the murder of Aw Teck Boon remains unsolved and the murderer(s) have not been found.\nBackground of Aw\nAw Teck Boon, the second of six or seven children, was born in Singapore in 1956; his father worked as a fishmonger. According to his younger sister, Aw became independent and lived separately from his parents and siblings during his teens, and worked as a sailor for most of his life. He did not have a close relationship with his siblings and parents, but would occasionally visit them during every Chinese New Year, and he never spoke much about his life outside home. Aw's eldest brother committed suicide in 1986.\nApart from his time on the ocean, Aw Teck Boon joined the Sio Kun Tong gang (affiliated with the Salakau) during his younger years and he gradually rose through the ranks, and become a much-feared triad leader with at least 60 men under his wing, in addition to five or six bodyguards beside him wherever he went. In the past, Aw had also worked under Ah Long San (birth name Chua Tiong Tiong), Singapore's most notorious loan shark who was later jailed for ten years in 2001 on charges of giving bribes to several policemen; Ah Long San died from a heart attack in 2018.\nBased on information of his gangland activities, Aw had managed at least 20 brothels in Geylang, and also collected extortion fees from the places under Sio Kun Tong's control, and in his heyday, Aw was able to single-handedly fight off several men in one go and was known to be merciless but willing to settle scores face to face with people who crossed his path. In the early 1980s, Aw and about 100 gang members were arrested for having killed a rival gang member during a clash with the deceased's gang, and he spent about ten years in detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (CLTPA) for being a kingpin of the underworld, in addition to armed robbery charges.\nAfter his release from prison in the 1990s, Aw married a Thai woman, who was around 15 years his junior. Together, Aw and his wife had one daughter Wendy, who was born in 1995, and they lived at a one-room flat at French Road, Jalan Besar. Aw and his wife and daughter lived a simple and frugal life in spite of Aw's influence in the underworld and the wealth he accumulated, partly because he often distribute his wealth to those in need, and the couple were a loving one. Aw himself had also gradually decreased his involvement in the gangland activities, but he continued to exert great influence in the underworld. Aw was also reported to often sail out at the sea and return to Singapore every few months to spend time with his family, and on average, he spent about two to three months in Singapore per year.\nAccording to the residents of Geylang, as well as friends and neighbours of Aw, Aw was known to be a bad-tempered but kind-hearted person. He was notorious for his bad temper and weakness in alcohol, and was noted to have flew into a violent rage and picked fights very often whenever he had too much to drink at the coffeeshops he frequented in Geylang and Beach Road, and he would offend people while he was heavily drunk. However, many attested to Aw's frequent acts of kindness to those around him. A female neighbour recounted that she knew Aw for more than 30 years, and she often seen Aw lending money to those in need, and Aw himself also brought his gangland associates to the funerals of any neighbours who died. A 69-year-old homeless man also said that whenever he slept in the void decks in Jalan Besar, Aw would see him and generously gave him money. A former prisoner, who previously met Aw while in prison, stated that Aw, an avid workout enthusiast, had kindly advised him to be a good person and turn over a new leaf, and be a filial son to his mother, and he was touched by Aw's encouraging advice and words, and Aw would reassure his prison mates that they should not be dissatisfied with life. Whenever he sailed and returned to Singapore, Aw would also drink together with his friends at coffeeshops in Beach Road, where he often hung out during his teens.\nMurder\nOn 5 May 1999, at about 3 am, 43-year-old Aw Teck Boon was murdered by an unknown assailant at Geylang.\nPrio",

    "Species of flowering plants\nOurisia calycina is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand and was described by William Colenso in 1889. Plants of this species are showy, perennial, large-leaved, tufted, rhizomatous herbs that are mostly glabrous (hairless) or with some non-glandular hairs. They have broadly ovate leaves. The flowers are in whorls in each node, with a regular calyx, a large, white irregular corolla, and fruits up to 1\u00a0cm long. The corolla tube is yellow with three lines of yellow hairs inside. It is listed as Not Threatened.\nTaxonomy\nOurisia calycina Colenso is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. William Colenso described O. calycina in 1889.\nThe type material was collected by William Colenso from the Waimakariri River near Bealey, South Island, New Zealand. The holotype is housed at the herbarium at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew (K000979335).\nOurisia calycina plants are large and showy perennials with whorls of flowers with large white corollas and large fruits (up to 1\u00a0cm long), characters they share with other New Zealand species O. macrocarpa and O. macrophylla. Like O. calycina, South American species O. coccinea and O. ruellioides are also large and showy with large fruits, but their flowers are in pairs instead of whorls in each node, and have red corollas.\nOurisia calycina is morphologically most similar to another large-leaved New Zealand species, O. macrocarpa. Although Colenso first described O. calycina as a species, Leonard Cockayne and Lucy Moore treated it as a variety of O. macrocarpa, and Mary Kalin Arroyo treated it as a subspecies of O. macrocarpa. Although Heidi Meudt also considered O. calycina to be a subspecies of O. macrocarpa in her monograph, a later phylogenetic study that showed that O. macrocarpa and O. calycina were not each other's closest relatives, which lead the authors to conclude that species rank would be more suitable.\nOurisia goulandiana Arroyo was described in 1984 but is now considered to be a synonym as no  morphological characteristics could be found to distinguish it from O. calycina.\nA number of morphological differences also distinguish O. calycina from O. macrocarpa, including its narrowly to broadly ovate leaves (vs. broadly to very broadly ovate, cuneate to truncate leaf bases (vs rounded to cordate), petiole fringed with hairs for its entire length (vs fringed on lower margins only), irregularly notched calyx lobe edges (vs smooth calyx lobe edges), regular calyx (vs irregular calyx), and hairy peduncle (vs glabrous). In addition, the two species are allopatric with O. calycina found in northern and central South Island, and O. macrocarpa found in southern South Island only.\nOurisia calycina can be distinguished from another large-leaved species, O. macrophylla, by its notched or irregularly toothed calyx lobes (vs. calyx lobes with smooth edges), and a lack of glandular hairs anywhere on the mostly hairless plants (vs. glandular hairs present at least on the pedicel and generally hairy plants).\nDescription\nOurisia calycina plants are large perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, with opposite leaves that are tightly tufted along the horizontal stem. Leaf petioles are 7.2\u2013109.6\u00a0mm long. Leaf blades are 12.3\u2013135.1\u00a0mm long by 7.4\u201371.4\u00a0mm wide (length: width ratio 1.0\u20131.7: 1), narrowly to very broadly ovate, widest below the middle, with an acute apex; cuneate or truncate base; and regularly crenate edges. Leaves are mostly glabrous (hairless), except for a fringe of densely distributed, long non-glandular hairs on the lower edges, and densely punctate on the lower surface, also with non-glandular hairs on the midvein. Inflorescences are erect, with racemes up to 61\u00a0cm long that have that lines of non-glandular hairs on the peduncle, 1\u20138 flowering nodes and up to 32 or more total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node has up to 9 flowers and 3\u20139 sessile and clasping bracts that are usually lanceolate to narrowly ovate or oblanceolate to obovate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves, 20.4\u201376.1\u00a0mm long and 6.2\u201336.3\u00a0mm wide, and become smaller toward the apex of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a glabrous or hairy pedicel that is up to 64.7\u00a0mm long and has non-glandular hairs only. The calyx is 7.5\u201312.2\u00a0mm long, regular, with all lobes equally divided to the base, acute, and with smooth or irregularly notched edges, with a few non-glandular hairs to densely distributed hairs on the edges and base. The corolla is 16.4\u201331.3\u00a0mm long (including the 5.7\u201316.1\u00a0mm long corolla tube), bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous and white (sometimes flushed pink) on the outside, and yellow and with three lines of yellow hairs on the inside. The corolla lobes are 5.9\u201315.3\u00a0mm long, spreading, and obovate or obcordate. There are 4 stamens up to 15.9\u00a0mm long which are didynamous, with two long stamens that are exserted, and 2 short stamens reaching the corolla tube opening; a short st",
    "\nThe Battle of Budla-an (Filipino: Labanan sa Budla-an, Cebuano: Sangka sa Budla-an, Spanish: Batalla de Budla-an) was fought on June 2, 1898, between the Philippine Cebuano rebel forces and Spanish and loyalist forces. It took place near Budla-an Falls in Talamban, Cebu, Philippines. Filipino forces won a victory in this battle in which a Spanish army pursuing them was crushed and routed.\nPrelude\nAfter their defeat at Cebu, the surviving Cebuano Katipunero forces under general Arcadio Max\u00edlom retreated to the mountains of central Cebu. As the commander of the revolutionary command in Cebu after the death of Le\u00f3n Kilat, Max\u00edlom reorganized and regrouped the rebel forces in the mountains, intent on going back to the offensive to take some of the towns in the province. Thus done, he once again attacked, taking the town of Tuburan. The Spanish army, intent of securing the whole island, had difficulty penetrating the heavily forested mountains but managed to find the rebel base near the Budla-an Falls in the town of Talamban (which is annexed by Cebu City in 1934 and is now one of its barangays). One rebel named Damaso Tablasa from the town of San Nicolas (now Brgy. Basak, Cebu City) blew his conch shell upon seeing the arriving Spanish forces to alert the rest of the Cebuano rebels, and they successfully prepared for the battle.\nBattle\nDefending the Filipino base camp in the hills at Budla-an were generals Alejo Mi\u00f1oza and Lorenzo Eje. They divided their forces into two halves, with Eje leading the half on the hill, while Mi\u00f1oza leads the other half on the base of the hill. Captain Garcia, leading the Spanish army, also divides his force into two, with the other half, being composed of cavalry, assigned to attack the rebel force at the base of the hill. The Spanish cavalry squadron then attacked Mi\u00f1oza and his unit who then promptly retreated to the forests. The pursuit continued until the Spanish cavalry found themselves surrounded by 200 Cebuano warriors wielding bolo swords. The Cebuano rebels then promptly counterattacked in melee range, and, proving their proficiency in the usage of bladed weapons, succeeded in forcing the Spanish forces to withdraw from the field in disarray.\nAftermath\nAfter their victory at Budla-an, the Cebuano rebel forces managed to score more victories elsewhere in Cebu, including the bloody battle at Liloan which killed a high-ranking Spanish officer leading a force of loyalists.\nSee also\nBattle of Tres de Abril\n",
    "Oil refinery in Peru\nThe Talara Refinery (Spanish: Refiner\u00eda de Talara) is an oil refinery in Pari\u00f1as, Talara, Piura, Peru that belongs to the state company Petroper\u00fa.\nIts origin lies in the first crude oil refinery in Peru in 1917, with an initial capacity of 10,000 barrels per day, by the International Petroleum Company (IPC). Since 2014, the complex began a renovation process, with many new plants under construction, with emphasis on deep conversion units and hydrotreatment of refined products.\nHistory\nMain article: La Brea and Pari\u00f1as\nThe refinery was created in 1917, when the International Petroleum Company (IPC), with a team of professionals from Talara, put into service four distillation stills with a processing capacity of 10,000 barrels per day (MBD). In 1926 it installed the four Thermal Cracking Units and, in 1929, the Lubricant Distillation Plant, entering that market. In 1938 it expanded its offering with the Asphalt Plant and, finally, in 1954 it began operating the Tubular Alembic No. 2 (today the Primary Distillation Unit), with a processing capacity of 45 MBDC of crude oil, which, in 1962, was expanded to 62 MBDC.\nState control\nWhen the so-called Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces was established, on July 24, 1969, the state company Petr\u00f3leos del Per\u00fa (Petroper\u00fa) was created, taking control of the country's oil industry, after the capture of La Brea and Pari\u00f1as on October 9, 1968, celebrating that date as National Dignity Day (abolished after 1980). It was not until 1975 that new industrial projects were promoted. The refinery installed the current Catalytic Cracking Complex (CCC), made up of the Vacuum Distillation Unit (UDV) with a processing capacity of 19.8 MBDC, and a Catalytic Cracking Unit (UCC) with a processing capacity of 16.6 MBDC. Later, they were expanded to 29 MBDC and 19 MBDC, respectively.\nWith the return of the democratic and civil government, the refinery installed a basic petrochemical complex made up of fertiliser plants (urea and ammonia), carbon black and solvents (acetone and isopropyl alcohol).\nSubsequently, between 1991 and 1992, the petrochemical complex was closed as part of the privatisation process. Despite this, in 1995 the current Liquid Cargo Dock came into operation, for the entry and exit of products from the refinery to the national and international markets. However, the privatisation process was mired in controversy due to the implications for natural gas packaging, which led to its completion being pending.\nIn 2003, the crude oil desalination plant was installed, the furnace replaced and the instrumentation system modernised. And in 2007 it put into service two crude oil storage tanks of 137 MB each.\nExpansion and modernisation\nOn May 29, 2014, Petroper\u00fa signed a contract for the execution of a primary part (Process Units) of the Megaproject of the New Talara Refining Complex with the Spanish firm T\u00e9cnicas Reunidas for an amount equivalent to US$2,730\u00a0million. At that time, it was planned to complement the project with the outsourcing of Auxiliary Units for the production of Hydrogen, Electric Power, Treated Sea Water, among other important facilities. However, the planning did not materialise due to the decision of the then chairman of the Board of Directors Germ\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez Salazar. Subsequently, the project became more expensive by approx. USD 1,000\u00a0million.\nCurrently, the New Talara Refining Complex has a committed investment of around US$5,000\u00a0million. On May 29, work on the modernisation of the refinery began.\nThe cost of modernising the refinery was estimated in 2014 at US$3.5\u00a0billion, of which 78% will be financed by Petroper\u00fa and 22% by the private company. The reduction of the sulfur content was expected to be reduced from 1,700 parts per million (ppm) to 50 (ppm) and increase oil refining from 60,000 to 90,000 barrels per day.\nIn 2019, the project was estimated to have a value of between US$4,500 to US$4,700\u00a0million. The project began in 2014 and by 2019 the project was 80.7% complete. By March 2020, it needed to finance 900\u00a0million dollars to complete the modernization of which a credit from the Spanish government of 285\u00a0million dollars had already been approved. By January 2021, the project was 92.88% complete.\nOn April 12, 2022, the new Talara refinery was inaugurated. On September 22, 2023, a fire occurred in the Fluidised Catalytic Cracking Unit. In December 2023, full operation of the refinery began.\nSee also\nTalara Basin\nLa Brea and Pari\u00f1as\n",

    "\n2024 studio album by James Blake and Lil Yachty\nBad Cameo is a collaborative studio album by British musician James Blake and American rapper Lil Yachty. It is set for release on June 28, 2024, by Quality Control Music, Motown, and Republic Records.\nBackground\nBlake and Yachty were first connected by their mutual friend Cam Hicks. Yachty had previously messaged Blake via Instagram in 2020 to praise his album Assume Form; Blake said he never saw the message, though he did say he'd \"been a fan of Yachty for years. And when I heard his last record , I was like, this is really a turn. Not many artists are brave enough to do something that\u2019s kind of opposite of the last thing they did.\"\nA photo of Blake and Yachty together in a recording studio was posted in March 2023. In July, Blake hosted a series of DJ concerts called CMYK; Yachty appeared at one show, and Blake debuted a song with Yachty at another. The CMYK series was later expanded to CMYK Group, including the concerts, a production house, and a record label, with Bad Cameo being one of CMYK Group's first projects.\nYachty first teased the album on February 13, 2024, with a video he posted to Instagram where he said \"I think James has worked with a quite substantial amount of hip hop artists. But this project is so left for both of us. Then, aside from the one picture that James posted, which he doesn't have many followers actually, I don't think people know that we know each other exist. So they're just going to be like 'What the f*ck? When did they do this?'\"\nRelease\nThe release date for Bad Cameo was announced on June 6, set for June 28 by Quality Control Music, Motown, and Republic Records. The duo also released the album's cover art, an overhead photo of a table showing Blake's hand next to a cup of tea and Yachty's next to a cup of lean. In a joint interview with Complex, the album was described as ambient and a merger of \"Yachty's ear for unexpected melodies with Blake's soulful tone and sharp production skills.\"\n",

Top co-wrote the song with Carson Chamberlain and Wyatt McCubbin, with Chamberlain also producing it.\nBackground\nFollowing years of recording as a bluegrass performer, Top pivoted to country music, and in September 2023, it was announced that he was signed as the flagship artist for the newly-formed independent record label Leo33. Carson Chamberlain, who played steel guitar for Keith Whitley in the 1980s and wrote songs for Alan Jackson in the 1990s, came up with the hook of the song and pitched it at a songwriting session with Wyatt McCubbin and Zach Top on September 25, 2020. Top bought into it immediately due to his love of 1990s-era country music, and the three developed the song based around heavy references to the decade including the mullet, jukeboxes, and name-checking \"Chattahoochee\" in its opening line. They cut a rough demo that day, but it wasn't until November 23, 2021, that Top entered Nashville's Backstage studio to record the song, after it had helped land him a publishing deal with Major Bob Music. On its release as his debut single to country radio several years later, Top said that \"literally the day we wrote it, it was like that was meant to be my first single. It seems like an awesome introduction to me and the type of music that people are going to be getting from me. If you like it, great. If not, don't expect nothing different\".\nCritical reception\nIn a review for Holler, Soda Canter favorably described the track as \"a nostalgic throwback to the heydays of the late '90s\" that foreshadows the kind of artist Zach Top is. Will Chapman of Country Central called it a \"raucous country opener\" for the Cold Beer & Country Music album and praised the instrumentation, highlighting the fiddle, steel, and the telecaster played by Brent Mason that added to the early 90s nostalgia of the track.\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Sounds Like the Radio\" was directed by Citizen Kane Wayne and premiered on January 12, 2024. It opens with Top and his band arriving at a rural radio station via pickup truck, where they tie up the disc jockey and plug into the sound board, before performing the song outside, allowing listeners to hear it over the airwaves. The video progresses with the band loading up their equipment and moving to a dive bar, where Top performs the song again in front of a crowd.\nChart performance\n\"Sounds Like the Radio\" debuted at number 56 on Billboard Country Airplay, and pulled in adds from 55 stations upon impact date. It has since reached the top 30 of that chart.\nCharts\n",

    "Hostage schools were educational institutions established by the French colonizer in Senegal and French Sudan where the sons of chiefs and notables were forcibly recruited to be monitored and trained to become auxiliaries of colonial power. The first hostage school was established in Saint-Louis in Senegal by Governor Faidherbe in 1855.\nTools of Colonial Imperialism\nChildren of the School of Hostages created in Saint-Louis, Senegal by Faidherbe (engraving by \u00c9douard Riou, 1889).\nContext\nColonization is driven by several factors. First, there is the economic aspect: Europeans want to exploit the resources of the African continent. The second aspect is demographic: seeing the population increase significantly, explorers want to discover new lands to settle in. Finally, one of the most important aspects, which still sparks debates today, is the cultural aspect. Indeed, the conquerors want to impose their way of life, beliefs, and cultures on their colonies.\nObjectives of the \"Hostage School\"\nThis is where the \"hostage school\" comes into play. It is intended for the sons of village chiefs and notables whom the governor has brought back from his military campaigns. Louis Faidherbe aims to instill French culture and values in these children. Their detention also allows the colonizers to maintain a certain order, as it dissuades the families of the \"hostages\" from rebelling. It reflects the need to have an African elite educated in the European manner and capable of serving as an interface with the population. Later, the school is explicitly renamed \"school for sons of chiefs and interpreters\". Some consider that it still exists today, but instead of being imposed, it is entrenched. This is reflected in the fact that parents enroll their children themselves in schools that are reproductions of the colonial system.\nHistory\nIt was established in 1861, then closed due to budgetary constraints on 1 January 1872. The school reopened on 31 March 1892, under a different name: College of Sons of Chiefs and Interpreters.\nIn 1902, the institution moved to a new building located on Ballay Avenue. The following year, it had 59 students.\nChildren of the School of Hostages created in Kayes (Mali) by Gallieni\nColonel Gallieni also established a School of Hostages in Kayes in Mali.\nThe School of Hostages in French Sudan and Senegal\nIn French Sudan (Present-day Mali)\nAt the end of the 19th century, French Sudan was governed by military forces. Kita saw the first school established in 1884. The French entry into Sudan was easy and quick. The first difficulty they encountered was language and communication with local populations. Moreover, the interpreters on-site were not able to facilitate communication, as they themselves did not master the Sudanese language, and even their mastery of the French language was approximate.\nAll these elements prompted the colonizers to open the first schools. The school, which was supposed to teach the French language, quickly became a tool of imperialism. The recommendations of Lieutenant Colonel Humbert prove this: \"The future of French Sudan depends largely on how successfully we will have shaped the populations that inhabit it...\". This project came directly from Paris. It was Joseph Gallieni who came up with the idea of teaching French at each post through a non-commissioned officer. The beginnings were difficult for the schools.\nFor example, in Kita, the students who were supposed to be present at the start of the term were not there. It was only eight days later that everything returned to normal with the hypocritical cooperation of the parents, who were not very favorable but were forced to accept due to the advantages offered to their children, particularly in terms of health. In 1888, there were four schools in Sudan: in Kayes, Bamako, Koundou, and Bafoulab\u00e9. All these cities were relatively rich posts. By the end of 1889, recruiting students and financing schools became much easier. However, some commanding officers in charge of the children were not capable, and thus the teaching of French was slowed down.\nSchool supplies were largely lacking. Senior commanders then took care of supplying the schools. The provided material remained in the spirit of the \"hostage school\", as it was similar to that used in schools in Paris, such as the subjects studied, such as arithmetic and French history. The level of the students was relatively good. A large number of students were retained, while others were dismissed. They were not allowed to speak in any language other than French, in order to improve their practice and to break the habit of using their mother tongue. After a year, the colonists began to draw from them the personnel they needed, for the telegraph or as interpreters. In 1890, the post schools were officially abolished. However, the children were not returned to their parents. The most talented children and those of political interest were kept, while others were taken as trainees. In ",

    "\nOperation Kahuta refers to a plot by Israel and India to destroy Pakistani nuclear facilities in Kahuta in 1980s to stop Pakistan from procuring nuclear weapons. Due to American pressure on Israel, the strike was aborted. However a dogfight between Pakistani and Israeli planes did occur.\nBackground\nPakistan had a history of tense relations with Israel. In 1967, Pakistan Air Force sent a group of its fighter pilots to engage the Israelis in combat during the 1967 Six-Day War and in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, greatly bolstering the Palestinians who were suffering repeated defeats to the Israel Defense Forces. A Pakistani fighter pilot, Saiful Azam, had shot down at least four Israeli fighter planes during the Six-Day War. After the Yom Kippur War, Pakistan and the PLO signed an agreement for training PLO officers in Pakistani military institutions. During the 1982 Israel-Lebanon War, irregular Pakistani volunteers served in the PLO and 50 were taken prisoner during the Siege of Beirut.\nIn 1981, Operation Opera launched by Israel against nuclear facilities in Iraq which led to the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear program  raised alarms in Pakistan that Israel could attempt a similar attack on Kahuta.\nPlan and preparations\nIsraeli Air Force F-16A\nIn the 1980s, Israel planned a possible attack on Pakistan's nuclear facilities with possible Indian assistance that would be reminiscent of the Israeli attack previously carried out on an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981. In 1981, three West German engineering firms were targeted in bomb attacks and several others received threatening phone calls, allegedly carried out by the Israeli secret service. All of the companies were suspected of selling dual use technology to Pakistan for use in their nuclear weapons program. Using satellite imagery and intelligence information, Israel reportedly built a full-scale mock-up of the Kahuta nuclear facility in the Negev desert region where Israeli pilots in F-16 and F-15 squadrons practiced mock attacks.\nThe plan was for Israeli Air Force to launch an air attack on Pakistan's nuclear facility in Kahuta sometime during the mid-1980s from an airfield in Jamnagar, Gujarat, India. The Israeli F-16 fighters bombers escorted by F-15 air superiority aircraft would also take off from Udhampur Air Force Station in Indian administered Kashmir and then fly low over the Himalayas to avoid early radar detection before attacking the Pakistani uranium enrichment centrifuge complex in the Rawalpindi city of Kahuta, then flying west, out of Pakistani airspace and returning to the Homebase evading RBS 70 MOPADs and Pakistan Air Force. In March 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed off (on) the Israeli-led operation bringing India, Pakistan and Israel to within a hair's breadth of a nuclear conflagration\". Israel's plan met with disapproval from some Indian officials on the grounds that Israel would not face any major consequences after the strike while India would surely face full-scale retaliation\u2014possibly nuclear\u2014from Pakistan for its involvement in the Israeli attack.\nIndian military officials also went to Israel in Feb 1983 to procure equipment that could neutralise Kahuta's air defences. Indian officials in addition to Mossad, also started collaboration with Shin Bet.\nPakistani response\nMilitary response\nA Pakistan Air Force F-16D Falcon inflight\nInter Services Intelligence learned of the collaboration between Mossad and Research and Analysis Wing about the plan of attacking Kahuta. The M.I. and Air Intelligence (AI) of Pakistan learned of the Israeli attempted operation when Israeli Air Force's fighter jets flew close to Pakistan's northern border.The PAF responded immediately and Combat Air Patrols were initiated, airspace of Kahuta was declared as No-fly zone.\nACM Shamim told General Zia-ul-Haq that, in the PAF's current state, \"Indian aircraft could reach the area in three minutes whereas the PAF would take eight minutes, allowing the Indians to attack the facility and return before the PAF could defend or retaliate\". Because Kahuta was close to the Indian border, a consensus was reached acknowledging that the best way to deter a possible Indian attack would be to procure new advanced fighters and weaponry. These could be used to mount a retaliatory attack on India's nuclear research facilities in Trombay in the event of an Indian attack on Kahuta. It was decided the most suitable aircraft would be the F-16 Fighting Falcon, which the United States eventually agreed to supply after the PAF refused to purchase the F-5. In 1983, when the first batch of F-16s reached Pakistan, ACM Shamim informed Zia of the PAF's increasing capability to effectively respond to an attack on the nuclear research facilities at Kahuta.\nThe PAF's aggressor squadron's jets belonging to No. 11 Squadron Arrows intercepted the IAF jets and gained a missile lock on one of the Israeli jets. The Israeli jets pulled back subsequently.\nDiplomatic response\nThe secretary of ",
    "Painting by Joseph-Marie Vien\nThe Cupid Seller (French - La Marchande d\u2019Amours) or The Accessories Seller (La Marchande \u00e0 la toilette) is a 1763 oil on canvas painting by the French artist Joseph-Marie Vien. One of the earliest works of French neo-classicism, it is based on an ancient fresco of the same name from Stabiae and shows a woman selling tiny cupids.\nThe work was acquired around 1778 by Louis Hercule Timol\u00e9on de Coss\u00e9, 8th Duke of Brissac, governor of Paris, who gave it to his mistress Marie-Jeanne B\u00e9cu, Comtesse du Barry in 1788 (she had previously been Louis XV's mistress). She was an important patron of Vien and kept the work at her chateau in Louveciennes, which was plundered in 1791 during the French Revolution, with the painting confiscated by the state. De Coss\u00e9-Brissac and du Barry both fell victim to the Revolution soon afterwards.\nIn 1837, during the July Monarchy, the work was taken to Palace of Fontainebleau, where it hang in the chambers of Helene, Duchess of Orleans, daughter in law of Louis-Philippe of France. It remains at Fontainebleau, in the 'Galerie des Fastes', on loan from the Louvre.\nHistory\nThe Virtuous Athenian Woman by Joseph-Marie Vien (1762)\nAfter Vien had studied ancient encaustic painting technique under the archaeologist and writer Anne-Claude-Philippe, Comte de Caylus in the mid-1750s and had created many works in the technique such as Minerva, he gave up on it and shifted to genre scenes set in the classical world. He believed that genre painting based on ancient models could reconstruct the culture and lifestyle of ancient Rome and Greece. This also shows the influence of de Caylus, whose Nouveaux sujets de Peinture et de Sculpture recommended studying not only ancient heroes' deeds but also genre scenes of everyday life.\nVien initially concentrated on ancient Greek life, producing The Virtuous Athenian Woman and The Young Corinthian Woman, both exhibited at the Paris Salon in the 1760s. These 'go\u00fbt grec' paintings were a great success, as their idealised beauty and cultivated simplicity suggested that ancient taste in art was recognisable to present-day people. For several years Vien devoted himself exclusively to this type of painting, producing Seller in 1763, differing from his other works of that kind in that it was based directly on an ancient model.\nThe original fresco on which the work was based had been discovered in 1759 and was published in 1762 as a copperplate by Giovanni Elia Morghen after a drawing by Carlo Nolli, that copperplate probably serving as a model for Vien's work. Until the mid 18th century, such ancient paintings were known almost exclusively via literature such as Pliny the Elder, since only a few figurative representations and ornamental decorations had been discovered since the Renaissance. The rediscovery of ancient frescoes in Herculaneum and Stabiae therefore caused a great stir. Vien now had the opportunity to recreate ancient painting through direct observation, after having already dealt with ancient themes and painting techniques in the 1750s.\nReception and influence\nCopperplate by Jacques-Firmin Beauvarlet dedicated to the Duc de Coss\u00e9-Brissac (1778)\nExhibited at the 1763 Paris Salon alongside other works by Vien and an illustration of the source fresco, the opportunity for comparison with an ancient model caused a huge public stir. There it was entitled The Accessories Seller, then a modern term. The depiction of every details was praised, such as the careful depiction of the folds of the garment, the carving of the chair, the pattern on the carpet and the still life on the table. Antiquity was definitely recognized as a model and Vien's successful imitation of the ancient style also lauded.\nCaesar in front of the statue of Alexander by Joseph-Marie Vien (1767)\nThe writer and art critic Denis Diderot in particular praised the perfect painting style, the harmonious colours and the picture's taste and poetry on the whole, comparing it favourably against works by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and his students, denouncing their whole Rococo style as outdated and praising Vien's classicist style as an opportunity to renew French painting and to bring an end to what he considered to be the tasteless art produced ever since the R\u00e9gence.\nDiderot and his contemporaries  viewed Vien's painting as a successful attempt to use ancient models in the present day to renew the late Baroque painting, which had fallen into crisis. Vien was thus the first painter in France to take the step towards the classicism of the 18th and 19th centuries. The original fresco and Vien's variation both remained famous for many years, even beyond France, with Jacques Firmin Beauvarlet making a large-scale print of Vien's painting, which was exhibited at the Salon of 1779 and further popularized the image. The fresco, Vien's work and associated prints all inspired reproductions ranging from textiles and porcelain to bas-reliefs and engraved gems.\nAfter the work's success, ge",

    "Demolished church in Dorset, England\nChrist Church was a Church of England church in Weymouth, Dorset, England. It was built between 1873 and 1874 as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St Mary's. It closed as a place of worship in 1939 and was demolished in 1957. The site is now occupied by the residential (with retail units) Garnet Court.\nHistory\nConstruction of Christ Church\nChrist Church was built in 1873\u201374 as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St Mary's, at a time when the population of Weymouth had increased and the town's existing churches were unable to provide enough accommodation. There was a lack of free seats for use by the poorer inhabitants of the parish and the demand for accommodation was even higher during the summer months when there was also an influx of visitors. A meeting was held by the rector of Melcombe Regis, Rev. Talbot A. Greaves, on 7 September 1866, which resulted in the formation of a committee tasked with raising the funds for a new church and a sub-committee for finding an eligible site. An offer from the trustees of the Middle School for the free use of their upper room as a temporary place of worship for up to 300 people was also accepted, along with the approval of a second curate for the parish at an annual stipend of \u00a3140.\nThe site chosen for the new church was on the corner of Park and King Streets in the rapidly expanding \"Park District\", within the north-west region of the parish, and was conveniently situated opposite Weymouth's train station. It belonged to Colonel Vandeleur and an agreement between him and the Melcombe Regis Home Mission Committee was reached in 1867. It was initially decided to lease the site for 1,000 years at an annual rent of \u00a360 rather than pay \u00a31,200 to buy the freehold, but the decision to purchase the site was made later in the year.\nRev. Greaves would lead the movement for the church and donated \u00a3600 of his own money towards it. Many other donations were received and fundraising events held over the next few years. A number of designs were considered for the church, including from at least three local architects, but that of London architect Ewan Christian was chosen in January 1871. Due to the nature of the ground, the architect recommended that concrete foundations should be laid across the entire site prior to any construction work. The tender of local builder Thomas Dodson was accepted for this work in July 1871 and it was carried out in 1872.\nDodson was also hired to construct the church and work began in May 1873, by which time approximately \u00a34,600 had been raised by the Committee. Although no ceremony was held to mark the occasion, one was held on 26 September 1873 when the Lord-lieutenant of the county, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury, laid the central stone of the chancel window. Christ Church was consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev. George Moberly, on 23 July 1874.\nThe church cost \u00a36,800 to build, including \u00a34,100 for Dodson's contract, \u00a31,200 for the purchase of the land and \u00a3500 for laying the foundations. The foundations were six feet deep across the entire site and, as it was to hold a peal of bells, the tower was strengthened by approximately 3,600 piles, eight feet in length and driven into foundations. There was seated accommodation for 800 people and, with the church being \"devote specially to the working classes\", half of the seats were free. The church finished in 1874 was approximately two-thirds of the original design and it was anticipated that extension work would be carried out when funds allowed in the future, but this never materialised.\nIn September 1874, a tower clock was gifted by Mr. Scardaw of Bath at the value of \u00a3200 and a peal of ten bells for the tower, along with their fittings, was gifted by the local MP, Henry Edwards, at an approximate cost of \u00a3350. The bells were cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough and chimed by machinery from Messrs Lund and Blockley of London, who were also responsible for their installation. The \u00a3200 for the machinery was funded by money raised at a bazaar held in the summer of 1874. The bells first rang out to mark the beginning of 1875 and this was the first occasion in which the town had heard a peal of bells ring out as the other local churches only had a single bell.\nA harmonium was originally installed in the church until funds allowed for the purchase of an organ. In 1889, it was decided to purchase one from St Barnabas' Church in Holloway which was for sale through the organ builder Eustace Ingram. It was built by Bishop & Son of London and had been recently restored by Henry Willis & Sons. The total cost of purchasing and fitting the organ in Christ Church was \u00a3227 and it was opened on 9 May 1890.\nClosure of church, World War II use and demolition\nThe site of Christ Church is now occupied by Garnet Court.\nBy the 1930s, falling congregation numbers left Christ Church surplus to requirements, something which was agreed by t",
    "2024 Australian Swimming Trials\nThe 2024 Australian Swimming Trials is a sports event that is being held from 10 to 15 June 2024 at the Brisbane Aquatic Centre to determine Australia's swimming team to the 2024 Summer Olympics and 2024 Paralympics.\nOlympic Qualification criteria\nFurther information: Swimming at the 2024 Summer Olympics \u2013 Qualification\nAustralia can select a maximum of 52 swimmers (26 of each sex, with up to 12 for relay only swimmers) for the Olympic team. To qualify, a swimmer must reach the allotted Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT) and finish in the top 2 positions in the \"A\" final. Following the end of the qualification period, FINA will assess the number of athletes having achieved the OQT, the number of relay-only swimmers, and the number of Universality places, before inviting athletes with OST to fulfil the total quota of 852. Additionally, OST places will be distributed by event according to the position of the FINA World Rankings during the qualifying deadline.\nOlympic Qualifying Times\nInformation retrieved from Swimming Australia and from Swimming at the 2024 Summer Olympics \u2013 Qualification.\nParalympic Qualification criteria\nFurther information: Para-swimming classification\nQualification requirements to be included in the Paralympic team is decided upon different classifications based on the degree of impairment an athlete experiences relative to an able-bodied swimmer's speed and performance. The three impairment groups at the Paralympic Games for swimming are physical, vision and intellectual. In addition, strokes and events are classified under \"sport classes\" that have a prefix letter and number. At the 2024 trials, qualification is selected based on a points system rather than time. Swimmers earn points based on how close they are to the world record in their respective qualification. This system is called the Multi-Class Point Score.\nEvent key\nThere are three swimming sport class prefixes for swimming strokes: \nS is for freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events.\nSB is for breaststroke\nSM is for individual medley events.\nAs well as swimming strokes, they are also divided into ten different categories:\nS1/SB1: swimmers who may have tetraplegia or some form of loss of muscular power in their legs, arms and hands.

    "\n2024 studio album by Bonny Light Horseman\nKeep Me on Your Mind/See You Free is the third studio album by folk supergroup Bonny Light Horseman, released on June 7, 2024, through Jagjaguwar. It received positive reviews from critics.\nWriting and recording\nThe album was written over the span of five months. Most of the album was recorded at the Levis Corner House pub in Ballydehob, Ireland, with additional recording taking place in Los Angeles.\nCritical reception\nKeep Me on Your Mind/See You Free received a score of 87 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on five critics' reviews, which the website categorized as \"universal acclaim\". Mojo commented that \"Bonny Light Horseman probably could've said just as much over half the tracks, but the fact they had the courage to keep digging ever deeper into their emotional turbulence has bourne spectacular results\", while Uncut felt that \"only a couple of tracks into Bonny Light Horseman's third album, it's clear this is something special. Beauty erupts from the vocal harmonies of Eric Johnson and Anais Mitchell, who lift the Technicolor folk-rock of 'Lover Take It Easy' into something close to heaven. And then it keeps getting better\".\nEric R. Danton of Paste wrote that there is \"scarcely a dud among the 18 songs\" and \"though the album feels long at 63 minutes, Johnson, Kaufman and Mitchell fill that time with reflections on longing, growing older and a pastoral kind of life\u2014all rendered in the soft light and lengthening shadows of a late summer afternoon fading toward evening\". Reviewing the album for Exclaim!, Anthony Boire concluded that \"the few moments of experimentation are outweighed by an assured grasp of traditional instrumentation, and it works out for the better. This is a well-travelled band firing on all cylinders.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Ana\u00efs Mitchell, Eric D.

    "Page from De Beatis's journal describing his meeting with Leonardo da Vinci on 10 October 1517. The red underlining and marginal notes indicate lemmata in the index.\nAntonio de Beatis was an Italian canon best known for his travel diary of 1517\u20131518, a work of major value in art history.\nLife\nDe Beatis was born in Molfetta, but the date of his birth is unknown.\nHe served as a secretary to Cardinal Luigi d'Aragona during the latter's European tour of 1517\u20131518, in which capacity he recited the divine office, helped prepare or even perform the Mass and wrote letters on the cardinal's behalf. He kept a personal diary of the trip, with daily entries beginning with their departure from Ferrara on 9 May 1517 and ending with their return there on 26 January 1518, although the trip did not end until they reached Rome on 16 March.\nDe Beatis made copies of his diary for friends, including the humanist Antonio Seripando. He was still making copies into 1521. The date of his death is unknown.\nTravel diary\nOnly one of the three copies of De Beatis's diary to be examined by scholars had a title: Viaggi, et Itinerario di Mon. R.mo et Ill.mo il Cardinal' de' Aragona .incominciando dalla Citt\u00e0 di Ferrara anno M.D.XVII. Mense Maij ('Voyage and Itinerary of My Lord the Most Reverend and Illustrious Cardinal of Aragon, Beginning from the City of Ferrara in the Year 1517, Month of May'). The original contained illustrations, of which only those of the Shroud of Turin and Francis of Paola are found in the surviving copies, which were not intended for publication.\nThe language of the diary is the vernacular of Apulia\u00a0, since De Beatis claims that his knowledge of Latin and Tuscan is inadequate. In an introductory letter to one of the 1521 copies, he states that he kept the diary at the cardinal's urging. It consists mainly of notes made at the time based on firsthand witness or, as De Beatis says, reports by \"persons of great authority and worthy of all trust and belief\". It does not appear to have undergone heavy editing or to be heavily indebted to written sources.\nThe purpose of the cardinal's trip was pleasure, taking advantage of a lull in the Italian Wars. According to De Beatis, the cardinal was familiar with Spain and Italy and so resolved that \"he would also get to know Germany, France and all those other regions bordering the northern and western ocean and make himself known to so great a variety of people.\" The official excuse for the trip was to meet the cardinal's relative, King Charles I of Spain, who was also Lord of the Netherlands. The meeting took place on 12 July in Middelburg.\nDe Beatis's diary is of major historical interest for its firsthand accounts of meeting with famous persons and for its descriptions of works of art. Besides Charles I, the cardinal met King Francis I of France at Rouen, the banker Jakob Fugger at Augsburg and the polymath Leonard da Vinci at Cloux. De Beatis saw tapestries designed by Raphael being produced in Brussels. He praises the Ghent Altarpiece as \"the finest painting in Christendom\". He claims that the figures in Da Vinci's Last Supper are based on certain Milanese personalities.\nDe Beatis provided his diary with a large alphabetical index, unusual for the time.\nNotes\n^ a b c d e f g h Moneta 1987.\n^ a b c Hale 1979, p.\u00a0xi.\n^ Hale 1979, p.\u00a041.\n^ Hale 1979, pp.\u00a06\u20137.\n^ Hale 1979, pp.\u00a07\u20138, 88.\n^ Hale 1979, p.\u00a06.\n^ Hale 1979, pp.\u00a046\u201347.\nBibliography\nHale, J.

    "Iranian British lawyer at Oxford Uni\nNazila Ghanea (born 1968) is an Iranian-born British lawyer. She is a professor of law at Oxford University and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief.\nLife\nGhanea was born in Shiraz in 1968/9. She left Iran in about 1979. She took her first degree at Keele University and she has master's degrees from Leeds University and Oxford University. She returned to her alma mater to gain her doctorate.\nIn 2000 she was employed at the University of London. In 2006 she left London to be the Professor of International Human Rights Law at the University of Oxford and to lead their Master's course on International human rights law. She has spent three decades in academia including a year teaching in China.\nIn 2018 she and her co-authors, Heiner Bielefeldt and Michael Wiener, were given the inaugural (Senior) Alberigo Award for their 2016 work,Freedom of Religion or Belief: An International Law Commentary.\nShe became the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief on 1 August 2022 when she succeeded Professor Ahmed Shaheed of the University of Essex. She had been proposed for the role by the state of Oman and several NGOs. She was chosen finally after short listing and interviews. It is an unpaid position to support the commitment of 173 countries to article 18 which states \"Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.

    "Sixteenth century Irish noblewoman\nRose O'Neill (Irish: R\u00f3is\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed N\u00e9ill; fl. 1587\u20131607) was an Irish noblewoman and queen consort of Tyrconnell. She was the daughter of Hugh O'Neill and wife of \"Red\" Hugh Roe O'Donnell, the two leaders of the Irish alliance during the Nine Years' War. Her marriage to O'Donnell was a deliberate move to unite the O'Neills and the O'Donnells, the two most powerful Irish clans of their day. She separated from O'Donnell in 1595.\nShe has been the subject of several poems and songs, particularly rebel song R\u00f3is\u00edn Dubh by James Clarence Mangan, making her somewhat of a nationalist figure for Gaelic Ireland. In poetry, her name is typically anglicised Rosaleen.\nFamily background\nShe was born into the O'Neill dynasty, specifically the MacBaron branch, in the sixteenth century. The O'Neills were the most powerful Gaelic Irish clan of their time, but by the mid-to-late sixteenth century, they had fallen into internal conflict due to a succession dispute. The clan split into many septs - the MacShanes, the MacBarons and the followers of Turlough Luineach O'Neill. It is possible this conflict influenced her upbringing.\nParentage\nRose O'Neill's father, the Earl of Tyrone\nHer father, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, was the son of clan chief Feardorcha \"Matthew\" O'Neill, 1st Baron Dungannon.\nThe identity of Rose's mother is unclear, as Tyrone is known to have four wives and various mistresses. Historian Robert Dunlop believed that Rose's mother was Catherine Magennis - however, since Rose was betrothed to Hugh Roe O'Donnell in the late 1580s, and Magennis married Tyrone in the 1590s, this is unlikely. According to brother-in-law Niall Garve O'Donnell, Rose was not a daughter of Tyrone's second wife Siobhan O'Donnell.\nHistorian Jerrold Casway suggests that Rose came from Tyrone's annulled first marriage to a daughter of Brian McPhelim O'Neill (possibly Katherine). If so, Rose would be seen by the English as illegitimate. Indeed, loyalist Niall Garve O'Donnell described her as \"illegitimate\" in a 1606 deposition. This could make Rose's birthdate sometime between the earliest date for Tyrone's first marriage, c. 1563, and its annulment in 1574.\nOther historians suggest she was a child of Tyrone's concubine. According to Casway, \"native society and Hugh Roe O\u2019Donnell might not see her that way. Hugh Roe could have been attracted to her and we cannot overlook that she was a daughter of the ascendant Hugh O\u2019Neill, the earl of Tyrone.\"\nMarriages\nHugh Roe O'Donnell\nIn 1587, O'Neill was either married or formally betrothed to Hugh Roe O'Donnell, tanist and son to the O'Donnell clan chief. Hugh Roe O'Donnell was about 15 at the time. This dynastic marriage would further cement a growing alliance between two Irish clans who had traditionally been mortal enemies for centuries. To this end, Tyrone had married Siobhan O'Donnell, Hugh Roe's elder half-sister, in June 1574. The Description of Ireland (1598) made reference to this alliance: \"This controversie was taken away by a double marriage, Tyrone having married O Donnell's sister, by whom he hath diverse sons, and O Donnell having married his daughter...\"\nHugh Roe O'Donnell was kidnapped by Lord Deputy John Perrot in 1587, but eventually escaped and returned to Ulster in 1592. O'Neill and O'Donnell were married in December 1592.\nA deposition dated 25 June 1593 states that the Seneschal O'Hagan and William McCrodan, a brehon of the Earl, \"went to O'Donnell's house to bring thither the Earl's daughter that is married to O'Donnell\". This likely refers to the formal home-bringing of Rose O'Neill as the bride of O'Donnell.\nIn 1595, with her father's consent, O'Neill and O'Donnell were separated. Her marriage to O'Donnell did not result in any children. In 1598, the author of The Description of Ireland claimed the separation was due to Rose's \"barrenness\".\nO'Donnell had hopes of a dynastic marriage alliance with Lady Margaret Burke, daughter of the Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde, who had refused to join the war. O'Donnell briefly took O'Neill back, but their marriage was eventually annulled.\nThe Calendar of State Papers makes reference to \"some breach between Tirone and O Donnell about Tirone's daughter\" on 2 April 1596.\nLater in 1600, O'Donnell schemed to marry Joan, sister of royal ally James FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond. This was blocked by loyalist George Carew towards the end of the year.\nDonnell Ballagh O'Cahan\nO'Neill married Donnell Ballagh O'Cahan, an Ulster landowner and later clan chief, sometime before the publication of The Description of Ireland in 1598.\nO'Cahan had previously been married to O'Donnell's sister Mary since about June 1593. It seems O'Cahan was never divorced from Mary which created enmity between him and his new father-in-law. Bishop of Derry George Montgomery wrote to Lord Deputy Arthur Chichester on 4 March 1607: \"the breach between  and his landlord  will be the greater by means of  daughter, his reputed wife, wh",
    "Portuguese politician (born 1987)\nPatr\u00edcia Alexandra Martins de Carvalho (born 1987) is a Portuguese politician and journalist. In the 2024 Portuguese national election she was elected to the Assembly of the Republic as a representative of the right-wing CHEGA party. She also serves as an assistant director of the national directorate of the party and is its director of national communications.\nEarly life and education\nCarvalho was born in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon on 19 December 1987. She obtained an undergraduate degree in social and cultural communication from the Catholic University of Portugal and completed a master's degree in cultural management from the same university in 2010. She then worked as a trainee journalist at the newspaper Correio da Manh\u00e3 for nine months, until the end of 2011. She joined the online newspaper Not\u00edcias ao Minuto in July 2012, where she stayed for less than a year, returning to Correio da Manh\u00e3, where she stayed until December 2013. She then went back to Not\u00edcias ao Minuto, writing as Patr\u00edcia Martins Carvalho, staying there until the end of 2019 when she was appointed as CHEGA's communications advisor.\nPolitical career\nCHEGA was a new right-wing party, considered by some to be extreme right, that was founded in 2019. In the 2019 national election its leader, Andr\u00e9 Ventura, was the only member to win a seat in the Assembly of the Republic. After his election he invited Carvalho to become his press advisor and director of national communications. In the 2022 national election Carvalho was placed second on the list of CHEGA candidates for the Set\u00fabal constituency but the party only won one seat in Set\u00fabal District, winning 12 nationally. In the 2024 election, called after the resignation of the Socialist prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, she was again second on the CHEGA list for Set\u00fabal. This time CHEGA won four of the 19 seats available in the constituency and 50 overall.\nIn the parliament Carvalho is a member of the Committee on Culture, Communication, Youth and Sport.\n",

Their goal was to surround the cities of Sarajevo and Gora\u017ede, which partially failed, but they managed to re-capture many lost lands around the same places.\nBackground\nThe Serbian goal, throughout 1992\u20131993, was to besiege and capture the cities of \u017depa, Srebrenica and Gora\u017ede. A few days before Lukavac '93, Bosnian Muslim militias successfully occupied Trnovo and surrounding mountain ranges which cutted communications between Serbian Herzegovina and the rest of Republika Srpska. After Operation Cerska '93, the VRS recaptured most of its lost lands east of Sarajevo, and besieged \u017depa and Srebrenica.\nOperation\nInitially, the ARBiH men count numbered 10,000. However, immediately after the start and successful implementation of the offensive actions of the VRS, the General Staff of the ARBiH sent elements of the 7th Muslim and 17th Krajina Brigades as reinforcements, jointly with a group of troops from the entire First Corps of the ARBiH with the strength of one brigade, making the number grow up to 13,000.\nOn July 10, Serb forces entered Trnovo, and successfully occupied it on July 11. The serbs later kept advancing west and reached Igman and Bjela\u0161nica at the beginning of August. The Operation was called off with the capture of the Rogoj and Grebak passes, strengthening even more communications between the two parts of Serbian-controlled Republika Srpska.\nAftermath\nAfter this operation, Sarajevo was now fully exposed to eventual Serbian attacks. Because of this, NATO pressued the VRS to withdraw from Igman and Bjela\u0161nica. During these negotiations, between these mountains a Demilitarized zone was called off, but was never put in place.\n",

She was a regular in defence over the next decade as the club occasionally challenged for honours without great success, and was among those to be offered a professional contract as Celtic increased their investment in women's football, as did rivals Rangers.\nFollowing the enforced hiatus of the Covid-19 pandemic, Celtic won one Scottish Women's Premier League title, two Scottish Women's Cups and one SWPL Cup between 2021 and 2024, with Rangers claiming most of the other trophies on offer to usurp the traditionally dominant Glasgow City. As one of the most experienced players along with Kelly Clark and Natalie Ross, Craig had a major role in her club's progression, also passing personal milestones of 200 appearances (May 2021) and 100 goals (February 2024, with two penalties against Rangers \u2013 regular conversions from the spot contributing to a high scoring tally for a defensive player).\nShe was named in the first SWPL PFA Scotland Team of the Year for the 2021\u201322 season, and signed a new contract with Celtic shortly afterwards; in October 2023, she agreed an extension running til 2026.\nInternational career\nCraig was selected regularly for Scotland up to the under-19s but has never been capped at full international level.\nPersonal life\nRaised in Clydebank, Craig was a postal worker prior to becoming a full-time footballer, often attending evening training sessions having already climbed several hundred flights of stairs that day on her delivery round among the tenements of Glasgow's South Side.

    "1939 literary account by\u00a0Constancia de la Mora\nIn Place of Splendor is an autobiographical account by the Spanish republican Constancia de la Mora in which she describes her life from her birth into an aristocratic Spanish family to her exile in the United States. It was published in 1939 in English as In Place of Splendor: The Autobiography of a Spanish Woman and in 1944 in Spanish in Mexico as Doble esplendor: Autobiograf\u00eda de una mujer espa\u00f1ola. \nContext\nThese memoirs form part of the women's autobiographies written in exile which have been called \u2018Memoirs of combat\u2019 as they reflect the experiences of the Second Republic and the Spanish Civil War. In this case, there is also El \u00fanico camino. Memorias de la Pasionaria (1979) by Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri, Mis primeros a\u00f1os (1987) by Federica Montseny and Cuatro a\u00f1os en Par\u00eds (1947) by Victoria Kent.\nAlso in this context are Isabel Oyarz\u00e1bal's memoirs, Rescoldos de la libertad, first published in English under the title Smouldering Freedom. The Story of the Spanish Republicans in Exile (1945) and later translated into Spanish. However, Oyarz\u00e1bal's account is presented in an objective and scholarly tone, as she makes numerous references to foreign texts. Moreover, most of the events she recounts are not the author's own experiences, but are taken from numerous oral or written accounts. Chronologically, Oyarz\u00e1bal's work completes Constancia de la Mora's account of the life of the Spanish republicans, since In Place of Splendor ends in the early days of exile in the United States and Rescoldos de libertad begins with the arrival of the exiles in Mexico.\nOverview\nIn Place of Splendor shows the personal and political evolution of the author who defied the social gender model to which she was destined by birth. She managed to free herself from a failed conventional marriage, obtained one of the first legal divorces in Spain and gained gainful employment. During the civil war, both she and her second husband, Ignacio Hidalgo de Cisneros, head of the Republican Air Force, joined the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). Constancia worked in the office of government propaganda and censorship, which later became an under-secretariat under the Ministry of State when the government moved from Valencia to Barcelona.\nThe author divided her autobiography into chapters relating her life to political events. Thus, under the title Childhood in Old Spain and Marriage: The Life of the Spanish Woman, she talks about the monarchy of Alfonso XIII and the dictatorships of Primo de Rivera and D\u00e1maso Berenguer. Spanish Awakening corresponds to the Second Republic and Widows of Heroes Rather than Wives of Cowards and Viva la Rep\u00fablica! constitute the fourth chapter and the epilogue.\nHis vision is conditioned by his militancy in the PCE, as can be seen in his harsh criticism of Largo Caballero, the entry into government in 1936 of the anarchist ministers and the May Days of 1937.\nPurpose\nDe la Mora arrived in New York City in March 1939 with the purpose of requesting aid for the almost defeated Spanish Republic. Convinced that the neutrality of the Western powers, which Germany and Italy had not complied with, had allowed the rebel side to win, he wanted to move American public opinion and make it change its neutral position in favour of humanitarian action. However, while he was working on his book, he received the news of Colonel Casado's capitulation and Franco's entry into Madrid. From that moment on, De la Mora focused on denouncing the inhumane treatment of refugees in France and the political reprisals suffered by the defeated who remained inside Spain.\nEditions\nThe first edition of the book (1939) was published in the United States in English under the title In Place of Splendor: The Autobiography of a Spanish Woman. Constancia de la Mora's education in England meant that she spoke good English, having spent a long period at Cambridge. However, several researchers claim that she was assisted in writing the book by an American journalist, Ruth McKenney.\nWhen De la Mora settled in Mexico, he wrote the Spanish version of the book (Doble esplendor), which was published in 1944 in Mexico. He removed anecdotes and explanations and added context. Translations were also made into French, German, Italian, Czech, Romanian and Russian, but the work had minimal circulation in Spain. It was not until 1977 that the first Spanish edition was published. In 2004, a new edition was published in Spain, with a prologue by Jorge Sempr\u00fan Maura.\nThere are differences in the wording and information presented between the English and Spanish editions. By translating into Spanish, his mother tongue, he had the opportunity to refine the initial text, which had been rushed and collective, although he still identified with it to a large extent. Although the story was already written and he could not change what had been told, he did present it in a different way.\nReferencias\n^ a b c Garc\u00eda Saiz, Laura (2023). \"Metamorfos",

    "American ice hockey player\nIce hockey player\nTrevor Connelly (born February 28, 2006) is an American ice hockey left wing for the Tri-City Storm of the United States Hockey League (USHL). Although he is considered a top prospect eligible for the 2024 NHL entry draft, he has been involved in multiple controversies that may impact his draft position.\nPlaying career\nBetween 2020 and 2022, Connelly played for four different amateur teams, unusual for a player of his calibre. One of the four, Bishop Kearney High School, suspended him almost immediately before he left within two weeks.\nOn March 14, 2022, Connelly signed with the Tri-City Storm of the United States Hockey League (USHL). At the 2022 USHL Fall Classic, he made his debut with the team in a 4\u20131 win over the Madison Capitols, and scored his first goal during a 6\u20134 victory over the Muskegon Lumberjacks. During the season, he would record a streak of 18 consecutive games with a point, the longest such streak in Storm history. He also became one of two Storm players ever to record goals in seven straight games. In total in his rookie season, he scored 24 goals and 47 points, earning second-team all-rookie honors.\nIn the 2023\u201324 season, Connelly recorded 31 goals and 78 points in 52 games, good for seventh in goals and second in points in the USHL. The only player in the league to record at least 1.5 points per game and leading the Storm in goals, assists, points, and shots, he was named a second team USHL all-star. Ending his two-year career in the league, his 125 points were the second most in franchise history and his 60 goals were the third most. Entering the 2024 NHL entry draft, he was widely recognized for his skill, particularly his speed, vision, and intelligence, but some scouts were put off by multiple controversial incidents throughout his youth and junior career.\nConnelly is committed to play college ice hockey at Providence College.\nInternational play\nIn five games at the 2023 Hlinka Gretzky Cup, Connelly recorded five goals and ten points to lead Team USA to a third-place finish. Three of his five goals came in the form of a hat-trick during a lopsided 8\u20131 win over Germany in the preliminary round. Tied with Berkly Catton for the tourmanent's leading scorer, he was widely considered one of the best players at the event.\nAt the 2023 World Junior A Challenge, Connelly scored four goals, including a Michigan goal, in an 8\u20135 bronze medal victory over Sweden. Including the four-goal outing, he finished the event with eleven points.\nAt the 2024 World U18 Championship, Connelly scored a Michigan goal against Latvia. In the finals, a 6\u20134 loss to Canada, he received a five minute major and a game misconduct for an illegal check to the head of forward Ryder Ritchie.\nPersonal life\nInitially a roller hockey player, Connelly switched to ice hockey when he was eight. He has a younger brother, C.J., who is also a hockey player.\nConnelly experienced harassment and bullying from both parents and other children from a young age. When he was 14, he was suspended from Bishop Kearney High School following an incident where he allegedly responded to hazing and humiliation at the hands of his teammates by urinating on another player's equipment.\nIn 2022, while playing for the Long Island Gulls, 16-year-old Connelly posted a picture to Snapchat of him and a teammate posing in what appears to be a library with a swastika built out of children's blocks, captioned \"creations\". He quickly removed the post and apologized, stating that he did not understand the extent to which his actions would be hurtful, but was removed from the team. He has since participated in diversity training and community service, and received mentoring from a rabbi.\nOn another occasion, Connelly was accused of and suspended for using racial slurs during a match, but he denied the allegation and the suspension was overturned when the league could not find any evidence that the incident occurred.\nCareer statistics\nRegular season and playoffs\nInternational\nAwards and honors\n",
    "\nThe Satellite Pro 400 series was a series of notebook-sized laptops under the Satellite Pro line manufactured by Toshiba Information Systems from 1995 to 1999. Almost all entries in the line feature Pentium processors from Intel, with the final models featuring the Mobile Pentium II. Toshiba oriented the Satellite Pro 400 series at professionals who wanted multimedia features in a compact package; accordingly, all models feature a slot for a CD-ROM drive, built-in audio, and accelerated graphics. The Satellite Pro was a major market success for Toshiba and helped the company become the number-one global laptop manufacturer for much of the mid-1990s, beating out major competitors such as IBM and Compaq. Most models in the series received positive reception from technology journalists.\nDevelopment and specifications\nA stack of Satellite Pro 470CDTs\nToshiba Information Systems introduced the Satellite Pro 400 series in June 1995, starting with the 400CDT and 400CS models. This was a month after they had announced the Port\u00e9g\u00e9 610CT, the first subnotebook with a Pentium processor, and almost a full year after they had announced the T4900CT, the first notebook-sized laptop with a Pentium processor. Toshiba oriented the Satellite Pro between their consumer Satellite notebooks and their higher-end Port\u00e9g\u00e9 subnotebooks; the Satellite Pro 400 series was specifically marketed as multimedia-oriented systems. Development for the Satellite Pro 400 as a whole was led by Karen Reader, senior product manager of the Satellite series at Toshiba America Information Systems in Irvine, California. The design for initial models of the Satellite Pro 400 series was based on Toshiba's earlier Satellite Pro T2150CDT, which featured an Intel DX4 clocked at 75\u00a0MHz. The 400CDT and 400CS upgrades the processor to a Pentium clocked at 75\u00a0MHz. The final entries in the line, the 490CDT and the 490XCDT, featured Mobile Pentium II processors clocked at 233\u00a0MHz and 266\u00a0MHz, respectively.\nEvery entry in the Satelltie Pro 400 series feature a rechargeable lithium-ion battery (upgrading from the NiMH batteries of its predecessors), a keyboard-integrated pointing stick (trademarked AccuPoint), and a hot-swappable expansion bay on the right side of the machine that allows users to slot in a floppy drive, a CD-ROM drive, or a blank to save on weight. Starting with the 440CDT, a secondary hard disk drive or a secondary rechargeable battery could also be installed in the bay. At the time of its release in November 1996, the 430CDT had the fastest CD-ROM drive on the market, at 10\u00d7 speed.\nThe Satellite Pro 400 series made near-exclusive use of Chips and Technologies's (C&T) range of graphics accelerators, starting with the 65546 chip in the 400CDT, followed by the 65548 in the 410CDT, both of which only have 1\u00a0MB of DRAM-based video RAM.:\u200a163\u200a The VRAM was boosted to 2\u00a0MB starting with the 420CDT, which features a C&T 65550 \"HiQVideo\" graphics accelerator. Toshiba equipped the 440CDT with C&T's F65554 \"HiQVideo\" graphics accelerator, which allowed for hardware-accelerated MPEG-1 video playback.:\u200a28\u200a The 480CDT was the last model in the line to feature a C&T graphics accelerator, sporting a F65555 with EDO DRAM\u2013based video RAM. The 490CDT and 490XCDT\u2014the final entries in the Satellite Pro 400 series\u2014make use of S3's ViRGE 2MX 3D chipset, allowing for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics.:\u200a53\u200a\nInitial entries in the Satellite Pro 400 series\u2014from the 400CDT to the 430CDT\u2014featured integrated AC adapters, taking the standard \"figure-8\" connector for AC power, in lieu of barrel connectors for DC input. This eliminated the need to carry an external power brick, at the expensive of adding heft to the main unit. Starting with the 440CDT, Toshiba off-loaded the power supply into the traditional external power brick. Additionally, models before the 440CDT were designed with a single speaker, positioned at the front of the machines, for playing audio without headphones, but only in mono\u2014a source of frequent criticism. The 440CDT redesigned the case to add an additional speaker, both housed above the keyboard, for stereo audio playback.\nThe Satellite Pro 440CDX, released in June 1997, was the first laptop on the market with a passive-matrix LCD utilizing high-performance addressing (HPA) technology. HPA was a technology developed by Sharp Corporation in order to decrease the long response times endemic to DSTN LCDs. Through a special technique known as multiline addressing, Sharp were able to reduce the response times, and therefore ghosting artifacts, to 150\u00a0milliseconds\u2014half that of DSTN displays (but still more than the 70\u00a0millisecond response times of contemporary TFT LCDs). Toshiba licensed Sharp's HPA patents in March 1997, rebranding it as FastScan. It was used again in the 460CDX, released in November 1997.\nSales\nThe Satellite Pro 400 series was an immediate hot-seller for Toshiba and helped the company overtake IBM as the global market leader for notebook com",

    "Anglo-Irish secretary (fl. 1585\u20131607)\nHenry Hovenden (fl. 1585\u20131607) was an Anglo-Irish secretary. He was foster-brother and chief advisor to Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone during the Irish Nine Years' War.\nHistorian John Marshall described Hovenden as O'Neill's \"captain, councillor, and confidant\". He was commonly known as Harry.\nBiography\nFamily background\nThe Hovenden family have roots in Kent, England. Henry's parents were Giles Hovenden, an English settler in Laois, and Elizabeth Cheevers, daughter of Sir Walter Cheevers. He had five siblings \u2013 John, Peter, Richard, Walter and Joanne \u2013 all born and raised in Ireland.\nEarly life\nSometime after 1558, young brothers Hugh and Brian, grandsons of Irish Gaelic nobleman Conn O'Neill, were moved into the Hovenden family's care. Their father Matthew had been killed in a succession dispute, and the Crown sought to keep the children safe from harm. Ultimately, their aim was to raise Hugh and Brian in the English manner, so that they would be more sympathetic to the English administration once they came of age and took their places in the Gaelic nobility.\nTo this end, Giles acquired the lease to a property in Balgriffin formerly belonging to Conn, via an arrangement made with the Crown. This is the residence where Henry grew up.\nO'Neill\nHenry Hovenden and Hugh O'Neill remained close throughout the rest of their lives, and Hovenden became his secretary and advisor. One of the first records of their professional association is from June 1585, when Hovenden is mentioned as a messenger and ambassador to the English Privy Council from O'Neill.\nHenry and his brother Richard commanded O'Neill's troops in the late 1580s. Circa late 1588, they organised the largest single massacre of Spanish Armada survivors in Inishowen. On 14 September 1588, writing from Dungannon, Henry Hovenden reported to Lord Deputy William FitzWilliam that \"they with 150 men attacked the Spaniards at Illagh, the O'Docartaig town, and the second day took them prisoners. Pray for a warrrant for their victualling &c, to Dublin. One of the prisoners has commanded over 30,000 men.\"\nHovenden took part in the Flight of the Earls in 1607, leaving Ireland for Continental Europe.\nIn media\nHovenden is a character in Brian Friel's play Making History.\nNotes\n^ Alternate spellings of his surname are Ovington and Hovendon.\n^ Hovenden has been described as an \"Englishman\", though in all likelihood he was born in the Pale, which was the part of Ireland under English control. It seems both his parents were born and raised in England.\n^ Shane O'Neill maintained that Matthew was not Conn's biological son.\n",

Such features, although sometimes inspired by historical examples or myths, more than often, directly contradict scientific knowledge of the historical basis, instead striving towards artistic ideas and creative freedom.\nFantasy Vikings are traditionally imagined with cattle horned helmets as their distinguishing trait, but modern depictions are often more varried in design.\nHistorical Vikings (the Norse)\nMain articles: Vikings and Norsemen\nThe Norse were a Germanic group of people which continued the European pre-Christianization pagan traditions into the Early Middle Ages and conducted vast amounts of naval raids between the 8th to 12th century, so called Viking raids, as well as naval exploration and trade, with people conducting such being called Vikings (entailing naval warrior, explorer and trader), which have given rise to the name Viking Age for the period.\nThe Vikings have since become heavily romanticized in the modern world, inspiring lots of fantasy stories.\nCommon features of fantasy Vikings\nPopular motifs are blue-eyed, often blond, Scandinavian stereotypes, featuring muscular men and women, with long, sometimes braided or beaded, hair, including the facial hair for the men, living in extreme portrayals of the Northern European landscape, such as fjords, coniferous forests and tundra. Their clothing often coincides with the fantasy barbarian, consisting of patchy fur clothing, sometimes intermixing elements from historical Norse and Medieval Celtic clothing, but various styles of tunic is also common. In modern media, men are sometimes depicted partly or fully bare chested, taking inspiration from the now obsolete myth of berserkers (Norse totem warriors) fighting bare chested without armor.\nClassic depictions often show fantasy Vikings wearing combat gear such as horned or winged helmets \u2013 conical helmets or spangenhelms featuring a pair of cattle horns or bird wings on each side \u2013 taken directly from various classical operas covering Norse legend by Wagner, which depicted the Vikings wearing helmets with horns and wings, popularizing this motif. Females are sometimes depicted with a pair spherical breastplates, one over each breast, also found in some Wagner attire. Modern depictions of fantasy Vikings, however, often leave out helmets altogether, instead opting to show various hairstyles, facepaint or tattoos.\nThe culture of fantasy Vikings often mix various elements from history, such as historical Viking raids and events, historical descriptions (such as Ahmad ibn Fadlan's meeting with the Rus' people and the Varangian ceremonies in De cerimoniis aulae Byzantinae), Norse mythology and legends, as well as Old Norse religion and elements from other pagan beliefs from around the world. Modern depitions often feature magical ornamental runes, engraved on weapons, clothes and tattoos, as well as on buildings, picture stones, rock faces and trees, etc., often taking notes from modern paganism, were each rune has its own meaning, including bind runes and other made up symbols. It is not uncommon for them to call their people by the name Viking.\nSimilarly to the fantasy barbarian and mythological berserker, fantasy Vikings are often depicted as being fearless barbarian elite warriors from uncharted land, hardened by long winters, a common spoof trope in animated media, such as, for example: Asterix and the Vikings and How to Train Your Dragon, among others.\nGustav Siehr in Wagner's G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, 1876\nMarie Haupt in Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, 1876\nDepiction of the Norse mythological hero Frithiof, 1899\nFantasy Vikings, ca. 1900\nPerson dressed as a fantasy Viking\nPeople dressed as fantasy Vikings\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla cosplay, Pyrkon, 2023\nHorned and winged helmets\nMain article: Vikings in popular culture\nTo the left, Leif Ericson depicted with a horned helmet, to the right, Olaf Tryggvason depicted with a winged helmet, 1908\nModern depictions of Vikings wearing horned and winged helmets is an invention of the 19th-century Romanticist Viking revival, mainly popularized by the Norse operas of Richard Wagner, beginning in the 1870s, which depicted horns and wings on the helmets of the Vikings.

Pinckney hires an outsider to pose as the weapons' inventor, as otherwise it would belong to Durant. Pinckney gets the lion's share of the gun's royalties, from which he pays Marsh a small amount. Lt. Sommers visits George Durant to discuss progress on the manufacture of his new cannon. While at Durant's home he meets his wife, and daughter Frances. He and Frances express interest in one another. Sommers learns that another new artillery piece has been produced at Durant Steel, and that Pinckney seems to favor it. (Curtain)\nAct II (Scene 1:Office of Durant Steel Works.) Frances is told by Lucy Smith that her father is up to something with Pinckney. Frances visits the office, and senses an attempt will be made to wreck Sommers cannon. When Lt. Sommers visits Edward Pinckney to check on the new gun, Frances is already there. Pinckney tries to intimate that he and the girl have an understanding. Later, Pinckney tells Smith to interfere with the oil bath that will temper the new gun. Sommers receives an anonymous message that Smith might try to sabotage his new cannon that night. (Curtain)\n(Scene 2:Foundry of Durant Steel Works, near midnight.) The scene opens with a noisy cacophony; white-hot metal is poured and trip-hammers reverberate. The workers are bare-chested and sweating in the heat of the works. At midnight, the noise lowers as the workers take their mid-shift meal. Pinckney has left instructions for Smith to work on the new cannon while the others are on break. As Smith works, he is accosted by Sommers, suspecting sabotage. They fight, and Sommers believes he has stopped the sabotage. Later the workers return to their labors and the noise resumes. (Curtain)\nAct III (Scene 1:Courtyard of Hotel, San Juan, Puerto Rico, several weeks later.) Lt. Sommers and the Durants and their staff had gone to San Juan for a holiday. Word is received that the new cannon exploded, killing seven sailors. Agent Bradley of the Secret Service arrives to question everyone about the weapon's manufacture. Lt. Sommers is ordered to return to Washington for a court-martial. He accepts George Durant's offer to accompany his family, Bradley, Pinckney, Marsh, and Durant's staff on their motor yacht back to Florida. (Curtain)\n(Scene 2:Wireless Room of Steamship Mongolian.)

    "1341 siege in Denmark\nThe Siege of Kalundborg (Danish: Belejringen af Kalundborg), also known as the Siege of Kalundborg Castle, was a siege by Valdemar IV of Denmark on the Norwegian-pledged Kalundborg Castle in 1341 during the Kalundborg War, which is named after the siege. The Danes were forced to retreat after a surprise attack on the Danish camp by Henry II, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg.\nBackground\nIn 1340, Valdemar IV of Denmark became king of a disunited and fragile Denmark. Denmark has previously been under the foreign rule of the German Count Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg, and Valdemar now set about to reunite Denmark.\nSeal of Duchess Ingeborg; Regent of Norway 1319\u20131327, Regent of Sweden 1318\u20131326. Also played a big political role after her regency.\nValdemar deemed Zealand to be the most important part of Denmark, and in 1341 he got control of Copenhagen which he could use as a base for further operations on Zealand.\nOn Zealand, the castle of S\u00f8borg and Kalundborg was mortgaged to Ingeborg of Norway, and these would be the first targets for Valdemar. Valdemar and his men marched to Kalundborg and had already started besieging the castle in mid-July 1341.\nSiege\nDuring his besieging of Kalundborg, Valdemar managed to receive support from 5 Wendish\u2013Hanseatic cities. In his camp, he made an alliance with the Wendish cities on 15 July, in which they received renewed ratification on their free letters, for helping Valdemar with warships during his siege. Additionally, Valdemar received support from Count John III of Holstein-Pl\u00f6n and Bishop Peder Jensen from the Archbishopric of Lund, who both promised to send ships to Valdemar's disposal.\nHowever, without a declaration of war, Henry II, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg showed up at Kalundborg with many warships and fell over Valdemar's vessels, which either deserted the action or were enclosed. Seeing this, the garrison in the castle made an outcome out of the castle, and Valdemar was subsequently forced to abandon his siege.\nAftermath\nOn 1 September, an agreement was made between the two parties, in which four men from each side would meet at Roskilde on Michaelmas to settle the feud between Ingeborg and Valdemar. However, the results of these negotiations are unknown.\nSee also\nSiege of Kolding (1368\u20131369)\u00a0\u2013 Siege in Denmark, 1369\nNiels Ebbesen\u00a0\u2013 Danish folk hero\nSiege of Skanderborg\u00a0\u2013 1340 siege in Denmark\nGerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg\u00a0\u2013 Count of Holstein-Rendsburg\nBattle of Nonnebjerg\u00a0\u2013 1340 battle in Denmark\n",
    "Mohawk ironworkers who built bridges and buildings\nMohawk Skywalkers constructing Rockefeller Center, 1928, photo Lewis Hine\nMohawk skywalkers is a nickname for Mohawk ironworkers and other construction workers who have helped construct buildings and bridges in American and Canadian cities including New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Detroit, Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. Mohawk workers have contributed to the construction of iconic structures across North America including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, Sears Tower, the CN Tower, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge, the San Francisco Bay Bridge, the George Washington Bridge, the United Nations Building, and the Twin Towers. Mohawk volunteers and workers contributed to both rescue efforts at Ground Zero and the rebuilding of the new World Trade Center.\nThe over 140-year history of Mohawk involvement in ironwork dates to the 1880s, when Mohawk workers from Canada and upstate New York began to travel to major cities across North America. In the 1920s, Mohawk families from Canada formed the ethnic enclave of \"Little Caughnawaga\" in Brooklyn, as many Mohawk ironworkers were employed in the construction of skyscrapers in Manhattan. According to the Journal of American Indian Education, Mohawk culture values \"physical bravery\" and the ethic of taking risks for the greater good of the people. In the 21st century, Mohawk workers remain involved in high-rise and bridge construction.\nCanada\nThe Mohawk involvement in ironwork began in 1886, when Mohawk workers were hired to help construct a bridge over the St. Lawrence River. The term \"walking iron\" is used to refer to Mohawk ironwork and the term \"booming out\" refers to Mohawks travelling to major urban cities elsewhere for work.\nBritish Columbia\nMohawk ironworkers contributed to the construction of Lions Gate Bridge and the Fairmont Hotel in Vancouver.\nOntario\nMohawk ironworkers from the Six Nations of the Grand River contributed to the construction of the CN Tower in Toronto.\nQuebec\nMaja Vodanovic, mayor of the Montreal borough of Lachine, has credited Mohawk workers for their contributions to Canadian construction work, saying that \"The Mohawk helped build modern-day Canada.\"\nMohawk ironworkers contributed to the construction of the Jacques Cartier Bridge and Tour Telus in Montreal.\nUnited States\nIn 2015, the United States Mint released a $1 coin featuring Mohawk ironworkers to honor Kahnaw\u00e0:ke Mohawk and Akwesasne Mohawk contributions to \"high iron\" construction.\nCalifornia\nMohawk ironworkers participated in the construction of the San Francisco Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.\nIllinois\nMohawk ironworkers contributed to the construction of Sears Tower in Chicago.\nMichigan\nMohawk ironworkers and their families settled in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood. The Indians of North America Foundation, hosted by Most Holy Trinity Church in Corktown, provided educational and social resources to the neighborhood's Mohawk population.\nNew York\nMohawk ironworkers on the Chrysler building, late-1920s\nMohawk workers began to settle in New York City as early as 1916. The Hell Gate Bridge was one of the first construction projects Mohawk workers participated in. Almost every major construction project in New York City since has involved Mohawk workers. Mohawk ironworkers were integral to the shaping of New York City's skyline, contributing to the construction of bridges and high-rise buildings including the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the George Washington Bridge, the Triborough Bridge, the Flatiron Building, the Waldorf-Astoria, the Henry Hudson Parkway, the RCA Building, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and both the destroyed and rebuilt World Trade Centers.\nBy the 1920s, a Mohawk enclave of Kahnaw\u00e0:ke and Akwesasne families had formed in downtown Brooklyn called \"Little Caughnawaga\". By the 1950s, over 700 Mohawk people lived in Little Caughnawaga. The enclave lasted until the 1970s. While mostly Mohawk, Iroquois and Indigenous workers also lived in the neighborhood.\nThe 9/11 Memorial and Museum has hosted an exhibit on the Mohawk skywalkers titled \"Skywalkers: A Portrait of Mohawk Ironworkers at the World Trade Center\".\nPennsylvania\nIn 1925, the Canadian Kahnawake Mohawk worker Paul K. Diablo was arrested in Philadelphia. In a landmark 1927 federal court case, the judge cited the Jay Treaty of 1794 to rule that Mohawks are legally entitled to freely cross the Canada\u2013United States border because the border crosses the Indigenous homeland of the Mohawk people.\nSee also\nIndigenous architecture\nHigh Steel\n",
    "Japanese racing team\nLM Corsa is a racing team based in Osaka Prefecture and the team is run by Osaka Toyopet Group's OTG Motor Sports.\nHistory\nOTG Motor Sports\nOsaka Toyopet, is a company who runs Toyota car dealer in Osaka founded OTG Motor Sports. The team runs Super GT GT300 under the LM Corsa guise. OTG also competes in F4 Japanese Championship since 2017. In their first two seasons, with Togo Suganami as their driver, the team won two races. From 2020 until the present day, the team has run Reimei Ito, Yuto Nozawa and currently Kenta Kumagai.\nLM Corsa\nSuper GT GT300\nIn 2014, OTG Motor Sports entered the Super GT GT300 Class under the LM Corsa name, running the BMW Z4 GT3 with Akira Iida and Hiroki Yoshimoto as their drivers. The team won its first race at the Suzuka 1000\u00a0km that year. Yoshimoto placed 6th in the drivers' ranking (Iida also had the same points as Yoshimoto, but was placed 7th due to missing the final race), and 5th in the team ranking. In 2015, the team's main car became the number 60 Lexus RC F GT3 while The BMW Z4 that participated the previous year also participated in the race with car number 51 as a second car run by Inging Motorsport. The drivers were Morio Nitta, who transferred from Toyota-affiliated apr, and Shigekazu Wakisaka, who returned to GT300 for the first time in seven years. However, the No. 60 RC F was not homologated by the FIA, so it had to undergo heavy performance adjustments, and it ended up with two 10th-place finishes (32nd in the drivers' ranking). The No. 51 car placed 17th with four points. In 2016, the No. 60 car's lineup remained the same, but the No. 51 car changed from the BMW Z4 GT3 to a new Ferrari 488 GT3. The team was formed with Morio Nitta, Akihiro Tsuzuki, and Shigekazu Wakisaka. The RC F was still not homologated due to difficulties in development, and the team was unable to score a single point.\nIn 2017, the team ran two Lexus RC F GT3. Toyota young driver Yuichi Nakayama, who had been transferred from apr alongside rookie Sho Tsuboi drove the 51 car. The car also changed its tires from Yokohama to Bridgestone. The RC F finally obtained homologation, with Car No. 51 winning the second round at Fuji and the seventh round in Thailand, and claimed third place in the standings. In 2018, the No. 51 car changed to No. 96 car, and the team was joined by Okayama Toyopet's K-tunes Racing, which had also participated in the 86/BRZ race. The driver was Morio Nitta, replacing Tsuboi. Akira Iida stepped down from driving, and was appointed as the team manager. Two-time FIA-F4 champion Ritomo Miyata was selected as his successor. The No. 96 car won two races, and Morio Nitta regained the record for the most wins in a row, which had been broken by Shinichi Takagi. On the other hand, the No. 60 car did not achieve any notable results other than a third-place podium finish in the fourth race in Thailand. In 2019, LM Corsa only ran one car after K-tunes opted to run independently, and the driver remained the same, but the tire supplier was changed to Dunlop. The team won the sixth race at Autopolis and placed 9th in the team rankings. They also run a Ferrari 488 GT3 for the non championship round with Togo Suganami, and Shunsuke Kohno.\nIn 2020, the team replaced Miyata with Shunsuke Kohno, and changed tire manufacturer to Michelin. In 2021, the team switched to the GT300 Toyota GR Supra and tire manufacturer returned to Dunlop.\nGT World Challenge Asia\nIn 2022, LM Corsa entered GT World Challenge Asia Japan Cup with the Ferrari 488 GT3 Evo 2020 with Shigekazu Wakisaka, and Kei Nakanishi as their drivers. The team made their full debut in 2024 with the new Ferrari 296 GT3, Wakisaka stays, as Ryo Ogawa joins him for this season.\n",
    " Belgian physical chemist (1882-1971)\nJean \u00c9mile Charles Timmermans (8 January 1882 \u2013 27 August 1971) was a Belgian physical chemist and educator. He was known for the discovery of plastic crystals and the published books on physical chemistry constants and experimental data of pure solutions. He also curated the work of Belgian chemist Jean Stas. Timmermans was a member of the Brussels school of thermodynamics centered around Brussels and one of the mentors of Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine.\nEducation and career\nTimmermans was born in Brussels and obtained his BA in chemistry from the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in 1900. His PhD on liquid demixing, which he received in 1905, was supervised by French chemist L\u00e9on Maurice Crismer. Timmermans became an assistant afterwards and worked in the laboratories of Viktor Rothmund at the German University in Prague from 1905 to 1906, Sydney Young at Trinity College Dublin from 1906 to 1908, Johannes Diderik van der Waals at the University of Amsterdam from 1908 to 1911, and Philippe A. Guye at the University of Geneva from 1912 to 1913. Timmermans became a lecturer (charg\u00e9 de cours) at the ULB afterwards. During World War I from 1914 till 1918, he worked in the Laboratory of the Belgian army located at Sorbonne University in Paris. After the war, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry commissioned Timmermans to establish a Bureau of standards at the ULB. This proposal was realized and Timmermans became the head of the International Bureau of Physico-chemical Standards (Bureau International des Etalons Physico-Chimiques) located at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles since its foundation in 1921. In 1923, Timmermans became a full professor at the ULB and stayed there until World War II. From 1941 to 1945, he was an academic on exile in London and was in charge of the Department of Higher Education at the exiled Ministry of Education. He was an executive committee member and represents Belgium in the Association of University Professors and Lecturers of the Allied Countries in Great Britain.\nIn 1945, Timmermans became a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium. He received the Gay-Lussac medal of the Belgian Royal Society of Chemistry (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Chimie Belgique), where he was a president from 1927 to 1928. Timmermans was the dean of the faculty of sciences at the ULB between 1935 and 1938. He also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Dijon.\nBibliography\nTimmermans, Jean (1928).

    "J\u014dmon period archaeological site in Saga, Saga, Japan\nThe Higashimy\u014d ruins (\u6771\u540d\u907a\u8de1, Higashimy\u014d iseki) is an archaeological site containing the ruins of a late early J\u014dmon period settlement and shell mound located in what is now the Chifu, Kintate neighborhood of the city of Saga Saga Prefecture Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2016 and is where the oldest woven baskets, combs, wooden plates, and organic remains yet discovered in Japan have been found.\nOverview\nThe Higashimy\u014d site is located on a low-lying marshland in the central Saga Plain, north of the modern Saga city. It is about 12 kilometers inland from the current coastline, but the coastline at the time of the J\u014dmon Maximum Transgression, about 7,000 years ago was near the site, and there is a large river nearby, and the site is estimated to be on the left bank of that river. The surrounding area of the site is tidal flats and reed fields, and it is thought that the environment was similar to the current Ariake Sea coast.  The Hisatomi Nihonsugi Site (\u4e45\u5bcc\u4e8c\u672c\u6749\u907a\u8de1), which is associated with a shell mound from the same period, is located 300 meters northwest of this site.\nThe J\u014dmon transgression lasted from 16,000 to 7,000 years ago, and the coastline continued to move during this period. It is believed that the area around this site became a coastline about 8,000 years ago, and the J\u014dmon people who sought seafood established a settlement here. The age of the excavated remains is limited to about a 500 to 600-year period. Since a thick clay layer of over five meters, which was created by the accumulation of floating mud (clay) carried by the flood tide in addition to the sediment carried by the river (just like the current coast of the Ariake Sea) has been deposited on top, it is believed that the area sank below sea level and became uninhabitable. After that, the sea gradually receded and the area became land again, but the groundwater level remained high. The remains were first discovered in 1990 as part of construction work on a flood control project. Archaeological excavations were conducted from 1990 to 1996, during which time the remains of numerous hearths, J\u014dmon pottery, stone tools (arrowheads, harpoons, awls, scrapers, grinding stones), animal bones, and a concentration of human bones that appears to be a cemetery were discovered. Eight bodies were excavated in what is thought to be the cemetery. All were buried in a flexed position. Isotopic analysis of the remains suggests that the diet consisted mainly of terrestrial plants, with seafood as a secondary protein source.\nIn 2003, a shell mound was discovered and subsequent investigations revealed six shell mounds at levels of two meters below sea level. The second phase of excavations from 2004 to 2007 focused on the No.1 and No. 2 shell middens, which are geographically in the middle of the six mounds.  Numerous mammal and fish bones, as well as bone and horn tools, were excavated. Numerous prehistoric storage pits were also discovered, mainly around the second shell mound, from which acorns that were not very decomposed and many woven baskets were excavated, and various wooden products such as plates, bowls, paddles, and combs were found in good condition from the clay layer that was a wetland at the time. These included some of the oldest in Japan, and the woven baskets with various weaving patterns and antler accessories at different stages of production, which gave a rare glimpse into the pattern culture of the time, as most prehistoric sites in Japan are prone to deterioration due to acidic soil, and there are few sites where the artifacts are well preserved.  The remaining four shell middens, the third to sixth, were preserved by filling without being excavated.\nThe main excavated artifacts are on display at the Higashimy\u014d J\u014dmon Museum, located in the Kosegawa Reservoir Management Building. Plans exist to open the site to the public by 2027. The site is approximately 15 minutes by car form JR Kyushu Saga Station.\nView of the Higashimy\u014d Site\nDeer horn accessories from the Higashimy\u014d Site\nJomon period basket from Higashimy\u014d Site\nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Saga)\n",

    "\nBatman has become a pop culture icon, recognized around the world. The character's presence has extended beyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the 1989 Batman film and its accompanying merchandising \"brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness\". In an article commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the character, The Guardian wrote, \"Batman is a figure blurred by the endless reinvention that is modern mass culture. He is at once an icon and a commodity: the perfect cultural artefact for the 21st century.\"\nIn other media\nMain article: Batman (franchise)\nThe character of Batman has appeared in various media aside from comic books, such as newspaper syndicated comic strips, books, radio dramas, television, a stage show, and several theatrical feature films. The first adaptation of Batman was as a daily newspaper comic strip which premiered on October 25, 1943. That same year the character was adapted in the 15-part serial Batman, with Lewis Wilson becoming the first actor to portray Batman on screen. While Batman never had a radio series of his own, the character made occasional guest appearances in The Adventures of Superman, starting in 1945 on occasions when Superman voice actor Bud Collyer needed time off. A second movie serial, Batman and Robin, followed in 1949, with Robert Lowery taking over the role of Batman. The exposure provided by these adaptations during the 1940s \"helped make  a household name for millions who never bought a comic book\".\nIn the 1964 publication of Donald Barthelme's collection of short stories Come Back, Dr. Caligari, Barthelme wrote \"The Joker's Greatest Triumph\". Batman is portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French-speaking rich man.\nTelevision\nAdam West as Batman in the 1960s TV series.\nThe Batman television series, starring Adam West, premiered in January 1966 on the ABC television network. Inflected with a camp sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, Back to the Batcave, West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show was instead a farce or lampoon, and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes, ending in 1968. In between the first and second season of the Batman television series, the cast and crew made the theatrical film Batman (1966). The Who recorded the theme song from the Batman show for their 1966 EP Ready Steady Who, and the Kinks performed the theme song on their 1967 album Live at Kelvin Hall. Adam West also appeared in character as Batman in several commercials and a 1966 US Government PSA for Savings Bonds. Despite not having an immediate continuation, the series spawned a (failed) pilot episode for a spin-off Batgirl television series and, decades later, the Batman '66 (2013\u20132016) comic book series, the animated films Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders (2016) and Batman vs. Two-Face (2017), and even the mockumentary Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt (2003).\nIn the 1996 episode Heroes and Villains of Only Fools and Horses, David Jason spoofed the role of Batman.\nThe popularity of the Batman TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in The Batman/Superman Hour; the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as The Adventures of Batman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From 1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's Super Friends series, which was animated by Hanna-Barbera. Olan Soule was the voice of Batman in all these shows, but was eventually replaced during Super Friends by Adam West, who also voiced the character in Filmation's 1977 series The New Adventures of Batman.\nIn 1992, Batman: The Animated Series premiered on the Fox television network, produced by Warner Bros. Animation and featuring Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman. The series received considerable acclaim for its darker tone, mature writing, stylistic design, and thematic complexity compared to previous superhero cartoons, in addition to multiple Emmy Awards. The series' success led to the theatrical film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993), as well as various spin-off TV series that included Superman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited (each of which also featured Conroy as Batman's voice). The futuristic series Batman Beyond also took place in this same animated continuity and featured a newer, younger Batman voiced by Will Friedle, with the elderly Bruce Wayne (again voiced by Conroy) as a mentor.\nIn 2004, an unrelated animated series titled The Batman made its debut with Rino Romano voicing Batman. In 2008, this show was replaced by another animated series, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, featuring Diedrich Bader's voice as Batman. In 2013, a new CGI-animated series titled Beware the Batman made its debut, with Anthony Ruivivar voicing Batman.\nIn 201",
    "\nCarmarthen Borough Council was a Welsh municipal body created by the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act which, at that time, replaced the ancient borough that had existed since medieval times. The Council consisted of 24 members, eighteen of whom were elected councillors and the remaining six were aldermen. Councillors were elected on a triennial cycle, with a third of councillors retiring each year. Aldermen were elected for a six-year term, normally from within the council membership although retiring aldermen were often re-elected without facing a contest.\nPrior to the First World War, municipal elections had occasionally been fought on a party basis but there was also a strong tradition of electing independent candidates.\n1919 Carmarthen Borough Council election\nThe first municipal after the conclusion of the Great War saw a number of retiring members opposed by Trades and Labour Council candidates and also Ex-Servicemen. The two groups had formed an electoral pact to fight the election but that fell apart a month before the contest. Nevertheless, representatives of both groups were successful at the expense of retiring members.\nEastern Ward (three seats)\nWestern Ward (four seats)\n1920 Carmarthen Borough Council election\nThe second municipal post-war contest was fought on party lines with supporters of the Lloyd George Coalition opposed by Labour candidates. In addition to the six councillors, three aldermen also retired, and this led to the defeat of the long-servong Walter Spurrell.\nEastern Ward (three seats)\nWestern Ward (three seats)\nBy-elections\nFollowing the election of aldermen, by-elections were held. Walter Spurrell, rejected by the electors at the triennial election, was returned but retiring alderman W.

    "American biochemist\nHenry Marshall Leicester (December 22, 1906, San Francisco \u2013 April 29, 1991, Menlo Park) was an American biochemist and historian of chemistry.\nBiography\nHenry M. Leicester grew up in San Francisco. His parents were among the earliest members of the Sierra Club and he was the youngest of their three children. At age 16 he graduated from San Francisco's Lowell High School. At Stanford University, he studied chemistry and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1927, a master's degree in 1928, and a doctorate in biochemistry in 1930. His doctoral dissertation is entitled Aromatic selenonium salts and the relative electronegativities of organic radicals. During Leicester's years of study at Stanford, Robert E. Swain was the head of the chemistry department.\nFrom 1930 to 1938 during the Great Depression, Leicester travelled in Europe (including research in Zurich and London); he spent a year as an instructor at Oberlin College, part of a year at the Carnegie Institution, and one year as a research associate at Stanford. From 1929 to 1936 he co-authored six papers with Francis William Bergstrom on selenium compounds, a paper with Leopold Ru\u017ei\u010dka on betulin derivatives, a paper with Thomas Midgley Jr. on polystyrene, and two papers with Albert Leon Henne on organic fluorine compounds. From 1938 to 1940 Leicester was a research associate at Ohio State University. There he became interested in the history of chemistry in Russia. Leicester corresponded extensively with chemists in the Soviet Union and gathered a large collection of Russian books on the history of science. He eventually donated his collection to Stanford University.\nAt the College of Physicians and Surgeons, San Francisco (now the University of the Pacific Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry), Leicester was a professor of biochemistry from 1941 to 1977, when he retired as professor emeritus. He chaired the departments of physiology and biology and also headed the college's research program. From 1947 to 1951 he chaired the Division of the History of Chemistry (HIST) of the American Chemical Society (ACS). He was one of the founders of the journal Chymia and served as the journal's editor-in-chief from 1950 to 1967. He was the author, editor, or translator of seven books. With his long-term collaborator Herbert S. Klickstein (1921\u20131975), he edited the book A Source Book in Chemistry, 1400-1900 (McGraw-Hill, 1952). The book contains selection from 82 authors and ends with a bibliography of biographies from periodicals and books. Leicester and Klickstein published in 1947 a 42-page article Philately: A Chapter In The History Of Chemistry in the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences. The article deals with the chemical composition of stamps and the role of chemistry in stamp production. For the 6th and 7th editions of the book Discovery of the Elements by Mary Elvira Weeks, Leicester contributed a chapter on the discovery of synthetic elements.\nLeicester was a prolific author on the history of chemistry. He contributed one article to Collier's Encyclopedia Americana, 7 articles to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and 21 biographies to the Dictionary of Scientific Biography (1970\u20131978). He also was an authority on caries and, during the 1950s and 1960s at California community meetings, strongly advocated water fluoridation.\nLeicester gained an international reputation as an expert on the history of chemistry in Russia. In 1962 he received the Dexter Award (now renamed the \"HIST Award for Outstanding Achievement in the History of Chemistry\"); he entitled his acceptance address Some Aspects of the History of Chemistry in Russia.\nIn 1941 Henry Leicester married Leonore Azevedo (1914\u20131974). They had a son and two daughters. Their son, Henry Marshal Leicester Jr. (b. 1942), became a professor of English literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz and  wrote The Disenchanted Self: Representing the Subject in the Canterbury Tales (1990, University of California Press).\nSelected publications\nArticles\nLeicester, Henry M.

    "\nMotor vehicle\nThe Audi Quattro Spyder was a concept vehicle developed by Audi. It was presented at the Frankfurt Auto Show in October 1991, but further development of the car was later terminated in 1992.\nHistory\nThe development of the Quattro Spyder began during 1990, and the vehicle was ultimately intended to serve as a replacement for their aging flagship vehicle, the Audi Quattro, whose production was ceasing in the following year. Audi was also seeking a sportier option despite the upcoming Audi S2, and viewed the Quattro Spyder as a good way to move upmarket. It was conceptualized in a similar timeframe to the Audi Avus Quattro, which was revealed just one month after this prototype was presented in Frankfurt.\nFollowing the reveal of the Quattro Spyder, around 3000 pre-orders were ostensibly placed by customers in the following months, however Audi AG ultimately made the decision to cut production short in 1992. This was done for many reasons, among them being price and expected production numbers. The projected sales price was around 100,000 German marks (approx. 55,000$US), but it was quickly realized that this price target could not be met by Audi. The vehicle was also expected to have a lifetime production of 25,000 units, but subcontractors that may have been expected to participate in production, including Porsche or Karmann, did not have the capacity at the time. In addition, the Audi CEO, Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, feared that it could serve as a potential competitor to vehicles throughout a declining Porsche's lineup, and did not want to hurt their sales.\nEngine & Design\nThe Quattro Spyder was very different from anything that Audi had produced to that point, and looked very similar to the Audi Avus Quattro that it had been developed alongside of.\nThe vehicle used the 2.8 liter (2,771 PS) V6 petrol engine found in the C4 Audi 100, and it made 172\u00a0bhp (129 kW;172 PS), and 181\u00a0ft\u00b7lb (245 N\u00b7m) of torque channeled to a 5-speed manual transmission. It was electronically limited to a top speed of 155\u00a0mph. (250 km/h)\n",

She led the team into the playoffs, winning the Channel League and making the CIF Southern Section semi-finals, and was named first-team All-CIF and the Ventura County Star's player of the year.\nKansas Jayhawks, 2007\u20132010\nSpreeman played college soccer for the Jayhawks at the University of Kansas. The university provided her with sign language interpreters for classes, practices, games, and interviews; on the field, she also read the lips of her teammates and coaches. She redshirted her first year, practicing with the team but traveling with them only for an exhibition series in Brazil in the spring. In the 2008 season, she scored in her first official game against Purdue and led the team with five goals by the seventh game. At the end of the season, with eight goals, she was named the Big 12 Conference Rookie of the Year and the USA Deaf Sports Federation Sportswoman of the Year and received national all-rookie recognition from Soccer America, SoccerBuzz, and TopDrawerSoccer.\nIn the 2009 season, Spreeman led the team with 12 goals, tied for second best in program history at the time, and was named to the United Soccer Coaches all-region third team. In the summer of 2010, she won her third national title with her club team, Eagles, at the USASA under-23 championships, recording the game-winning assist in the final. She concluded her college career in 2010 with 23 career goals, seventh in program history as of 2023, and six assists.\nInternational career\nSpreeman has represented the United States internationally in deaf soccer since the age of 15, when she started all six matches in the team's gold medal-winning debut at the 2005 Summer Deaflympics in Australia. She received the Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the 2016 World Deaf Football Championships in Italy, where the United States won gold. She also won gold at the 2021 Deaflympics in Brazil. She led the team to win the 2023 World Deaf Football Championships in Malaysia, scoring 13 goals in six games, and repeated as the tournament's Golden Boot and Golden Ball winner. For her performance, she was also named U.S. Soccer's first Female Deaf Player of the Year in 2023.\nSpreeman set a single-game team record with six goals against Australia on June 1, 2024, in an exhibition double header with the women's national team. As of 2024, she is the deaf national team's all-time leading scorer and the only active player from the team's original roster at the 2005 Deaflympics.\nPersonal life\nSpreeman was raised in Ventura, California, one of three daughters of Rick and Rhonda Cressy. She was born very hearing-impaired, which her family discovered when she was nine months old, and originally wore hearing aids in both ears and learned to speak. During her second year of high school, the little hearing she had in her right ear disappeared, after which she became increasingly deaf.\nAs of 2023, Spreeman lives in Newport Beach, California. Outside of soccer, she works as a spa esthetician.\n",

Centered on two psychotic brothers who escape from death row and take a suburban family hostage, it was described by Variety as a \"parodistic genre piece\", and by Sundance head Geoffrey Gilmore as \"completely delirious and truly inspired\". His next notable project was The Convent (2000), a supernatural horror film starring Adrienne Barbeau, which critic Joe Leydon felt was \"markedly more accomplished than the usual run of self-consciously campy horror schlock\", adding: \" dwells gleefully on scenes of jokey, over-the-top gore, but otherwise keeps the pace brisk enough to sustain the fang-in-cheek mood\".\nMendez received praise for his work on The Gravedancers (2006), a ghost story set in a cemetery, with Fangoria commenting, \"If the basic narrative  familiar ... Mendez  that it can still work when staged with gusto. There are moments when the action and images tip over into silliness, but you have to hand it to Mendez: the very last major effect is completely gonzo and yet done with such poker-faced conviction that the scene remains exciting instead of becoming laughable\". His next film was the sci-fi creature feature Big Ass Spider!, which premiered at SXSW in 2013 and was positively reviewed by critics: The Hollywood Reporter called it \"shamelessly Corman-esque\", saying that it \"does almost everything just a tiny bit better than it needs to\" and \"relishes its campy heritage from the title card onward\", while Paste's Jim Vorel wrote, \"It has a motor on it, propelling itself through its under-80 minute runtime without ever taking a breath ... There will undoubtedly be detractors who lump it into the same category as  but  an easily noticeable upgrade in quality . It's more good-natured, less stilted and in many ways more fun\".\nMendez directed two films released in 2016: action thriller The Last Heist and horror comedy Don't Kill It. Describing the latter, which follows an eccentric demon hunter, The Austin Chronicle said it was full of \"belly laughs\" and noted, \" hit quite the right tone in his films to date ... But in the perfectly self-aware Lundgren, he has  his perfect muse/foil for his brand of  horror spoof\". In a similarly positive review, the Los Angeles Times commended Mendez on his ability to \" up the pace\", as well as for bringing \"a lightness and unpretentiousness\" to the material. His next film as director was the 2022 anthology feature Satanic Hispanics, of which Paste said, \"The way these stories all blend into one darkly hilarious, deliciously violent stew is almost hypnotic\".\nIn addition to directing and producing, Mendez has worked as an editor on many of his own features, alongside various documentaries, television films, and series such as Beavis and Butt-Head. His acting roles include small parts in Hatchet II (2010), Terror Toons 3 (2015), and Malignant (2021).\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nExternal links\nMike Mendez at IMDb\nMike Mendez at Rotten Tomatoes\n",

    "\nNomination is an Italian-based global jewelry brand, best known for its Italian Charm Bracelet or the Nomination bracelet.\nHistory\nNomination Composable bracelet\nThe brand was founded in 1983 with the first company name G4 by Paolo Gensini in Sesto Fiorentino, nearby Florence, Italy, a city with a centuries-old tradition of goldsmiths and jewelers. Working as an ice cream maker in youth, Paolo Gensini decided to create a customizable bracelet just like the flavors of an ice cream that everyone can choose something unique. In 1987, Paolo Gensini designed the Composable bracelet with gold letters and symbols named with the trademark Nomination that later in 2000s gave its name to the Company itself, becoming a brand. Each bracelet was personalizable with various themes, letters, numbers, symbols etc.\nIn the 90s, the bracelet was a huge success first in Italy, and then in the early 2000s in the North European countries and straight after the United States. Since the bracelet came from Italy, it was called the Italian Charm Bracelet or the Nomination bracelet. In the 2000s, Nomination named this collection Composable, to protect its brand. It is made of more than 3,000 links with various themes.\nIn 1996, the company opened the first monobrand store in Milan. In 2008, Nomination celebrated 25 anniversary of the brand and launched a new line of Silvershine Composable Collection.\nIn 2014, Nomination received Michelangelo's David Award that, thanks to their professional activity, \"have brought the name of Florence high in the world\".\nIn 2019, the brand launched the \"One for you, one for me\" campaign, which aimed to show a connection among individuals, mirroring the interlocking links of Nomination bracelets. The brand's catalogue featured nearly 2,500 links. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Nomination continued to invest and promote new projects, enhance electronic commerce. At the same time, the company operated five thousand independent retailers and 50 singlebrand stores.\nIn 2023, the company launched its first flagship store in Cape Town at the V&A Waterfront.\nThe company launches every season a new Links design for the Composable bracelet and new complete jewelry collections. As of 2023, Nomination is sold in more than 40 countries through independent jewelry stores and in singlebrand stores in the main cities worldwide.\n",
    "\nJoseph Maria Adolf von Berenger or in Italian as Adolfo di B\u00e9renger (28 February 1815 \u2013 3 March 1895) was a German-born forester who worked in Italy. He established the first forestry school in Italy at Vallombrosa, now called the Forest Institute of Vallombrosa. He is considered the founder of Italian forestry. \nLife and work\nBerenger was born in Ebenau, Munich, the son of Johann August, a Bavarian officer of French origins and estate owner and his wife Johann Eugenia von Fabris. He studied in Munich, and then at the Mariabrunn Academy near Vienna and joined service in Venice under the Duke of Parma. In 1849 he became a forest inspector and was involved in studying the Cadore forest cutting system. From 1856 he was in charge of the forests of Cansiglio where he studied the plantation of white fir in clearings. He was made adjunct general of the central forestry inspectorate of Veneto in 1858. In 1865 he was transferred to Venice. After the annexation of Veneto into the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1866 he was appointed Inspector General of Forestry under the Ministry of Agriculture and also appointed as the first director to the national forest academy which was begun at Vallombrosa in 1869. His work on forest conservation often involved dealing with local opposition and while he saw livestock herding as an ancient and important livelihood he was involved in imposing limits to the number of animals allowed to graze inside forests. He published some early guides to the use of mathematical approaches in managing forests, with notes from 1865 to 66 titled Rudimenti di matematica applicata specialmente alla tassazione ed assestamento delle foreste. In 1877 he clashed with the minister Salvatore Maiorana-Calatabiano on a forestry bill. Also faced with the death of his son Augusto he retired prematurely at the age of 62 but continued to work on forestry research. He was able to continue to conduct experiments in reforestation. He published a 800-page treatise on forestry Selvicoltora (1887). He promoted a system of planting uneven aged stands which were closer to nature. He also wrote on the history of forests in Archeologia forestale and established a system of taxation for forest use that became the norm in Europe. He corresponded with George Perkins Marsh who appreciated the Studii di archeologia forestale and made use of ideas from Italian forestry such as artificial rejuvenation of forests and \"imitating nature\" in his book Man and Nature (1864). At the time of his death, Marsh was visiting Berenger in Vallombrosa. Berenger suffered from blindness towards the end of his life and died in Rome where he was buried at Magnale.\n",

It was active during the East Prigorodny conflict, when it focused on the plight of Ingush refugees and the Russian military's support for the government of North Ossetia.\nHistory\nThe Congress of the Ingush People held its first meeting in the Chechen capital of Grozny on 9 September 1989. The meeting was numbered as the second congress in recognition of the Congress of the Revolutionary Ingush People, which took place on 4 February 1919 and declared Ingushetia as a separate entity from the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The congress established an organising committee for preparations to establish Ingush independence. It additionally published demands to adjust the Ingush border to include Prigorodny District and eastern parts of the city of Vladikavkaz (then known as Ordzhonikidze), a proposal that infuriated the leadership and populace of North Ossetia\u2013Alania, and was one of the contributing factors to the East Prigorodny conflict.\nIn December 1990, the congress' first leader and leader of the Nijsxo party, Issa Kodzoev, was removed from his position and replaced by the moderate Beksultan Seynaroyev\u00a0. The split was solidified following a 7 January 1990 rally by Nijsxo, which grew into a riot.\nThe Congress held its second meeting, also in Grozny, on 6\u20137 October 1991. At the congress, it was determined to establish a People's Assembly of Ingushetia (Russian: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0418\u043d\u0433\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0438), and the congress was renamed accordingly. Another measure adopted at the congress was for a popular referendum on establishing an Ingush republic. The referendum occurred on 30 November of the same year and succeeded with widespread support.\nThe East Prigorodny conflict began in October 1992, and ended within a month, resulting in the ethnic cleansing of the region's Ingush population. The Congress, which had previously promised that the Russian government would support Ingushetia during the conflict (on the contrary, they had supported North Ossetia), faced a rise in anti-Russian and Ingush nationalist sentiment. Seynaroyev resigned from leadership and became part of the Organising Committee, which held leadership roles. In a 17 January 1993 emergency session, the congress condemned the state of emergency and the Russian military presence in Ingushetia, and called for the International Court of Justice to formally condemn Russian and North Ossetian military activities.\nPrior to the 1993 Ingush presidential election the congress selected major general Ruslan Aushev as its candidate in December 1992, although he was an independent. Aushev would go on to win the election unopposed. The slow pace of efforts to resettle Ingush refugees from the conflict, as well as continued ethnic violence in eastern North Ossetia, led to another outburst of anti-Russian sentiment. On 15 May 1993, the congress declared its intention to establish the Republic of Ingushetia as a \"secular, legal, democratic state in union with the Russian Federation\". At the 11 September 1993 congress, delegates urged Aushev to begin preparing a referendum on Ingushetia remaining part of Russia.\nOn 22 November 1999 the Congress of the Ingush People was legally subsumed into the People's Assembly of the Republic of Ingushetia, establishing it as the legislature of the Republic of Ingushetia.\nOrganising Committee (1992\u20131999)\nThe sole permanent member of the Organising Committee was Bembulat Bogatyryov\u00a0 after he became a member of the Federal Assembly of Russia.

    "Bosnian War mass killing\nThe Kukavice massacre was the mass murder of 21 Bosnian Serb civilians by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) on 27 August 1992 in the village of Kukavice, located in the municipality of Rogatica, during the Bosnian War.\nCrime\nOn 27 August 1992, Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) troops attacked a convoy of Bosnian Serb civilians in the village of Kukavice, mainly consisting of women, children and the elderly. The column of fleeing civilians had been traveling from the village of Jabuka towards Rogatica when they were fired upon; there were about one thousand elderly men, women and children on tractors and in passenger vehicles. One of the survivors of the attack stated that bodies were left lying on the canyon road for nearly 40 days to decompose, before a group of Serbs arrived to pick them up for burial. 21 people were killed and 39 were wounded.\nTrial\nIn December 2013, members of Bosnia's State Investigation and Protection Agency arrested seven men in connection with the crime, after the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Republika Srpska had filed a war crimes report in 2006. As part of the evidence, a video of the crime scene was presented. Controversy had previously ensued after parts of it had allegedly been used in the film No Man's Land by Danis Tanovi\u0107 with the victims being represented as Bosniaks.\nIn a first-instance verdict in March 2017, the four accused who had been put on trial, Muhamed and Tarik Sisic, Emir Drakovac and Aziz Susa, were acquitted. However, the Appeals Chamber quashed the verdict and ordered a retrial. In October 2018, the four were found guilty and sentenced to a total of 29 years in prison. Muhamed Sisic was sentenced to eight years in prison, Tarik Sisic and Aziz Susa to five years each and Emir Drakovac to 11 years. The trial chamber took into the account Drakovac's murder, beheading and genital mutilation of another civilian as well as the torture of a Serb soldier, in a separate case, when considering his sentence for the crimes in Kukavice (his combined verdict was 15 years). In April 2019, Muhamed Sisic's sentence was increased to 10 years and Tarik Sisic and Aziz Susa to 8 years each. Muhamed Sisic was commander of the Sabotage Squad of the Bosnian Army's Kukavice Company, while Tarik Sisic and Susa were members of the same company.\n",
    "Peruvian footballer\nJhamir Adri\u00e1n D'Arrigo Huanca (born 15 November 1999) is a Peruvian footballer who plays as a winger for Alianza Lima. He has played over 100 games in the Peruvian Primera Divisi\u00f3n, in which he also represented Academia Cantolao and Melgar.\nClub career\nDeportivo Cantolao\nBorn in Callao, D'Arrigo began his career at hometown club Academia Deportiva Cantolao in 2018. Two years later, he received his first contract to play in the Peruvian Primera Divisi\u00f3n in the 2020 season. He made his debut on 2 February, starting in a 2\u20131 home win over Cienciano on the opening day. He played 13 games over the season, scoring once on 31 August as a consolation at the end of a 6\u20132 home loss to Sporting Cristal.\nIn the 2021 season, D'Arrigo played more frequently as other players in his position departed the club. On 28 August, he put Cantolao 2\u20130 up away to Club Universitario de Deportes, though the game ended in a draw. In 2022, he scored a career-best five goals in 29 games, including two on 6 March in a 3\u20132 win over Carlos A. Mannucci at the Estadio Miguel Grau.\nMelgar\nD'Arrigo's performances in 2022 earned the attention of Club Alianza Lima, but he instead opted for FBC Melgar on a three-year deal, ahead of the Arequipa-based club's first year in the Copa Libertadores. He played four games in that continental campaign, scoring on 6 June to cap a 5\u20130 home win over Club Atl\u00e9tico Patronato of Argentina. His only goal of the league season in 2023 came six days earlier in a 2\u20132 draw at home to Club Deportivo Universidad C\u00e9sar Vallejo.\nAlianza Lima\nAt the end of 2023, D'Arrigo did sign for Alianza, on a four-year contract. The club from Lima met his release clause of US$500,000. He made his debut on 4 February as a substitute away to Alianza Atl\u00e9tico and set up the second goal of a 2\u20130 win for Sebasti\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez. His first goal came on 19 May to open a 3\u20132 home win over Deportivo Garcilaso.\nInternational career\nAt the start of September 2023, D'Arrigo was named in the Peru national football team for 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Paraguay and Brazil, due to Bryan Reyna's injury. Still uncapped, he was named in a preliminary squad for the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica in the United States, but dropped from Jorge Fossati's final 26-man squad.\nPersonal life\nIn June 2024, an ex-partner of D'Arrigo with whom he had a daughter, denounced him on television for alleged physical abuse. He allegedly responded by threatening to diffuse intimate photos of her.\n",

It also manufactures manufactures solar cell and PIN photodetectors.\nBackground\nLin Xiucheng was an employee of Sanming Iron and Steel Mill, largest integrated steel producer in Fujian province. In October 1992, Lin and  Sanming established Sanan Steel in Anxi which Lin served as chairman and CEO. Sanan Steel was the processor of Sanan Group which would serve as the holding company for Lin and his family.\nIn October 1999, Lin attended a Hi-tech Fair in Shenzhen where he came into contact with LEDs for the first time. Lin saw potential in the industry and travelled to the United States to recruit talent.\nIn 2000, Sanan Group, a branch of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and Xiamen SASAC signed a joint venture contact for the establishment of Sanan Electronics.\nGradually Sanan Group acquired most of Sanan Electronics' shares. In 2004, Sanan Group moved its headquarters to Xiamen. In February 2004, Lin's son-in-law Lin Kechuang was appointed as the CEO of Sanan Electronics.\nIn July 2007, Sanan Electronics planned to become a publicly listed company via backdoor listing by acquiring listed company, Tianyi Science & Technology. In June 2008, the asset restructuring was completed where Sanan Electronics held 46.69% of shares and Sanan Group held shares of 22.06%. On 14 July 2008, Tianyi Science & Technology shares were renamed to  Sanan Optoelectronics and the backdoor listing was completed.\nIn March 2016, Sanan was in discussion with Taiwanese semiconductor firm, GCS Holdings to acquire it for US$226\u00a0million. However, in August 2016, the transaction was blocked by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Instead a memorandum of understanding was signed to form a new joint venture, with the aim of building a 6-inch wafer plant.\nIn October 2016, Sanan announced it was in talks to acquire Osram for US$8.2\u00a0billion. However, by December 2016, Sanan dropped its plans after witnessing political opposition to the acquisition of Aixtron by Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund. Sanan had previously cancelled purchase orders for Aixtron in December 2015 causing Aixtron's stock price to drop 43%.\nOn 10 April 2019, Sanan was added to the Bureau of Industry and Security Unverified List. On 27 June 2019, Sanan was removed from the list leading its shares to surge by 10%.\nIn December 2019, Sanan acquired Wipac from its parent, Carclo for \u00a310.5\u00a0million.\nFor China's top 10 chip subsidy recipients in 2022, Sanan came second receiving 1.03\u00a0billion yuan in subsidies.\nIn June 2023, Sanan and STMicroelectronics announces they signed an agreement to create a new 200-mm silicon carbide device manufacturing joint venture in Chongqing. The cost of the project would be US$3.2\u00a0billion and  is expected to begin production in the fourth quarter of 2025, with full buildout anticipated in 2028.\nIn May 2024, it was reported that Sanan was accelerating its plans to expand overseas. Sanan also announced its joint venture with STMicroelectronics would likely launch the production line by the end of 2024.\nSee also\nSemiconductor industry in China\n",

    "Clarity of near objects or letters\nNear visual acuity or Near vision is a measure of how clearly a person can see nearby small objects or letters. Near vision is usually measured and recorded using a printed hand-held card containing different sized paragraphs, words, letters or symbols. Jaeger chart, N notation reading chart and Snellen's near vision test are the commonly used charts for measuring and recording near visual acuity. Near vision testing is usually done after correcting the distance vision.\nEye conditions like presbyopia, accommodative insufficiency, cycloplegia etc. can affect the near visual acuity. According to the World Health Organization, the near visual acuity less than N6 or M0.8 at 40\u00a0cm is classified as near visual impairment.\nPhysiology of near vision\nDuane's classical curves showing the amplitude or width of accommodation as changing with age. Mean (B) and approximate lower (A) and upper (C) standard deviations are shown.\nIn human, near vision is obtained by a mechanism called accommodation. With the help of accommodation, a normal young human eye can change focus from distance (infinity) to as near as 6.5\u00a0cm from the eye. This change in focal power of the eye of approximately 15 diopters (the reciprocal of focal length in meters) occurs as a consequence of a reduction in zonular tension induced by ciliary muscle contraction. This process can occur in as little as 224 \u00b1 30 milliseconds in bright light.\nThe amplitude of accommodation declines with age. The dependency of accommodation amplitude on age is graphically summarized by Duane's classical curves.\nNear vision impairment\nThe difficulty in reading small prints or blurring at a reading distance is commonly defined as Near vision impairment (NVI). Difficulty with near vision increases with age. Eye conditions like presbyopia, accommodative insufficiency, cycloplegia etc. can affect the near visual acuity. Ocular diseases that cause defective distance vision like cataract and macular degeneration, can also  cause reduced near vision.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the near visual acuity less than N6 or M0.8 at 40\u00a0cm is classified as near visual impairment.\nPresbyopia\nPresbyopia is physiological insufficiency of accommodation associated with the aging of the eye that results in defective near vision. Management of presbyopia includes corrective glasses such as a special pair of reading glasses, contact lenses, bifocals, or progressive lenses.\nInsufficiency of accommoation\nInsufficiency of accommoation also known as Accommodative insufficiency is another condition that causes blurring of the near vision. Management of accommodative insufficiency needs correcting any underlying refractive errors. Vision therapy may also help improving the condition.\nCycloplegia\nCycloplegia is the paralysis of the ciliary muscle causing paralysis of accommodation and defective near vision. Cycloplegia can be caused intentionally by instilling some medications into the eyes, or it can occur due to some neurological disorders, or trauma to the eye.\nHypermetropia\nHypermetropia, the most common refractive error in childhood, affects the near vision more than distant vision.\nTests for near vision\nTo measure near vision, a patient is seated in a well illuminated room is asked to read the handheld near vision chart kept at a distance of 25\u201335\u00a0cm away from the eye. The distance used for near vision testing may vary depending on the occupation or basic need of the patient. The smallest test type that the patient can read is the measure of his near acuity. Commonly used tests for near vision are described below.\nJaeger chart\nThe Jaeger chart is a card on which paragraphs of text are printed, with the text sizes increasing from 0.37\u00a0mm to 2.5\u00a0mm. This card is to be held by a patient at a fixed distance from the eye dependent on the J size being read. The smallest print that the patient can read determines their near visual acuity.\nRoman test types\nRoman test types also known as N notation reading charts or Point chart, uses Times New Roman font, and records near visual acuity as N5, N6, N8, N10, etc. N notation is the standard near vision test in the United Kingdom and Australia.\nM-scale notation\nThe M-scale indicate the distance in metres at which the height of a lower case 'x' letter subtends a visual angle of 5 minutes of arc at the nodal point of the eye. The M system is said to have sufficient advantages over other systems for near vision testing to make it a universally accepted standard method. M-scale notation is widely used in North America.\nSnellen's near vision test\nSnellens near vision chart\nSnellen's near vision test is a near vision chart introduced by Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen, which uses the same principle of his distance vision Snellen chart. Size of Snellen's near vision chart is approximately 1/17th of the normal Snellen chart.\nMNREAD acuity chart\nThe MNREAD acuity chart is a text based chart used to measure near visual",
    "Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich, commonly referred to as simply GC, GCZ, or Grasshoppers, is a professional multisports club based in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. Founded on 1 September 1886, it is the oldest active football club in Z\u00fcrich and second only to FC St. Gallen in Switzerland. With 27 national championships and 19 Swiss Cup victories, Grasshoppers are still the most successful club in the country.\nEarly History\nFoundation and first championship wins\nGrasshopper was founded on 1 September 1886 by Tom E. Griffith, an English student. Using a 20 Swiss franc donation, the club acquired an English football shirt in blue and white colours (as worn by Blackburn Rovers). The English students were from Manchester Grammar School in Manchester. Arthur J. Finck was one of the students who was part of the group that founded the club. Its first match came in October of that year against ETH and ended in a goalless draw. In 1893, Grasshopper became the first Swiss team to play in (what was then) Germany, defeating Strasbourg 1\u20130.\nThe first Swiss championships (then called \"Serie A\") were held in 1897\u201398 and were won by Grasshopper, as was the first championship played using a league system in 1899\u20131900. After two more titles in 1901 and 1905, Grasshopper had to withdraw from the Swiss championships in 1909 because they lacked a suitable playing ground. They rejoined in 1916.\nThe illustrious coach Vittorio Pozzo played briefly for Grasshoppers, around 1905\u201306, before he joined Torino.\n1920s: Dori K\u00fcrschner era\nAfter rejoining the Swiss championship in 1916, GC won their fifth championship in 1921. In 1925 started the era of the Hungarian manager Izidor \"Dori\" K\u00fcrschner, a former member of the coaching staff of the Swiss national team that won the silver medal at the 1924 Olympics. Under K\u00fcrschner in the 1920s, Grasshopper won the championship twice (in 1927 and 1928) and also the first two editions of the Swiss Cup in 1925\u201326 and in 1926\u201327.\n1930s: Beginning of Karl Rappan era\nDori K\u00fcrschner stayed with Grasshopper until 1934, winning another championship in 1931 and two more Swiss Cups in 1932 and 1934. Then started the era of Austrian coach Karl Rappan who managed also the Swiss national team for several years during that time. The first title under Rappan came in 1937 and the second one in 1939. They also won the Swiss Cup in 1937 and 1938.\n1940s: More titles during World War II\nDespite the turmoils of World War II the Swiss championships were held during the 1940s with the Grasshoppers winning in 1942, 1943 and 1945. Until Karl Rappan left the team in 1948, the team also won another five Cups (in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1946).\nSwiss football giants\n1950s: Last successes for a long time\nIn 1952, Grasshopper won their 14th Swiss championship title and their 12th Swiss Cup. They managed to win the double again in 1956, but it turned out to be their last silverware for a long time, as they had to wait for 15 years until their next championship and for 27 years until their next Cup win. In 1956\u201357 Grasshopper participated for the first time in the European Cup which was founded in the previous season. They reached the quarter-finals where they were eliminated by Fiorentina.\n1960s: No titles\nDuring the 1960s, Grasshopper won no championships and no Cups. The best result was a second place in 1968, which qualified them to play in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the predecessor of the UEFA Cup. However they had no success at European level either, and they were eliminated in the first round.\n1970s: Return to success and UEFA Cup semi-final\nIn 1971, Grasshopper finally returned to the top of the Swiss league. After the end of the season, GC and Basel were tied at the top of the table and thus a play-off match was played in Bern. In front of 51,000 spectators, GC defeated Basel 4\u20133 after extra time to win their 16th championship. Throughout the decade Grasshopper was among the best Swiss teams. Their next championship win came in 1978.\nThanks to their top finishes in the league, GC was able to play in European competitions almost every year. In 1978\u201379 they defeated Real Madrid in the second round of the European Cup, but lost the quarter-final against the eventual winner, Nottingham Forest. But their biggest European success to date came in the 1977\u201378 UEFA Cup where they reached the semi-final against French side Bastia. After a 3\u20132 win at home, they traveled to Corsica for the second leg but lost 0\u20131 and were eliminated due to the away goal rule.\n1980s: Hat-tricks\nThe 1980s were a successful decade for Grasshopper. In the years 1982, 1983 and 1984, GC won the championship three times in a row, achieving the \"title hat-trick\". In all three seasons, Servette from Geneva was their strongest rival, and in 1984 a championship-deciding game had to be staged in Bern because the two teams were equal on points after the regular season. GC won that match 1\u20130 by a converted penalty kick by Andy Egli in the 104th minute.\nGrasshopper were also ",
    "Luke Wadding (1628 - 1687) was a Roman Catholic priest, Bishop, and author of Christian poetry during the Stuart Restoration. \nLuke Wadding was born at Ballycogley Castle in County Wexford into a wealthy Recusant mercantile family and was descended from Ireland's Old English nobility. Following the slaying of his father during the Sack of Wexford by Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army and the confiscation of the family's property by the Commonwealth of England, Wadding fled to France and was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest after attending the Irish College in Paris and the Sorbonne.\nAfter 17 years of living in exile, Fr. Wadding returned to Ireland with orders to rebuild the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns following the devastation of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. He continued to do so covertly despite the renewed religious persecution caused by the anti-Catholic witch hunt masterminded by Titus Oates and Lord Shaftesbury. He died shortly before the 1688 overthrow of the House of Stuart and was buried beneath the Chapel of the Franciscan Friary in Wexford Town.\nBishop Wadding also remains well known as one of the later Metaphysical poets. Two of his works of Christian poetry, heavily influenced by the works of Richard Crashaw, are still sung as part of the Wexford Carols cycle during the Twelve Days of Christmas and have also been recorded commercially.\nEarly life\nWadding was born in his father's castle at Ballycogley, in the Yola-speaking Barony of Bargy. He was one of four children, in a family of staunchly Catholic, Royalist, and Old English descent. His father, Walter Wadding, was a successful merchant of Wexford, while his mother, Mary (n\u00e9e Sinnott), was the daughter of Raheen landowner David Sinnott.\nDespite the Wadding family's Royalist preferences, escalating pressure was being put on Irish Catholics, and particularly on Ireland's Hiberno-Norman elite, to conform to the State-controlled Protestant Church of Ireland. After the massacres of the Old English Catholic civilians of The Pale by New English Royalist and Protestant soldiers under the command of Sir Charles Coote during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Walter Wadding found it impossible to continuing balancing political loyalty to King Charles I with religious loyalty to the Catholic Church in Ireland. He reluctantly joined the Irish Catholic Confederation. During the later Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Walter Wadding was killed for this very reason by Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army during the 2\u201311 October 1649 Sack of Wexford and all his property was declared forfeit to the Commonwealth of England under the Act of Settlement. Later that same month, Luke Wadding fled Ireland for a 17-year long exile in Catholic Europe.\nAccording to historian D.P. Conyngham, \"It is impossible to estimate the number of Catholics slain the ten years from 1642 to 1652. Three Bishops and more than 300 priests were put to death for their faith. Thousands of men, women, and children were sold as slaves for the West Indies; Sir W. Petty mentions that 6,000 boys and women were thus sold. A letter written in 1656, quoted by Lingard, puts the number at 60,000; as late as 1666 there were 12,000 Irish slaves scattered among the West Indian islands. Forty thousand Irish fled to the Continent, and 20,000 took shelter in the Hebrides or other Scottish islands. In 1641, the population of Ireland was 1,466,000, of whom 1,240,000 were Catholics. In 1659 the population was reduced to 500,091, so that very nearly 1,000,000 must have perished or been driven into exile in the space of eighteen years. In comparison with the population of both periods, this was even worse than the famine extermination of our own days.\"\nMeanwhile, Luke Wadding entered the Irish College in Paris in 1651, where he is known to have closely followed the ongoing debates over Gallicanist and Jansenist heresies. He is also known to have been ordained to the priesthood at an unknown date and to have received a doctorate in theology from the Sorbonne in 1668.\nRebuilding a Diocese\nAccording to Diarmaid \u00d3 Muirithe, \"Ferns was without a regular Bishop between 1651 and 1684. Bishop Nicholas French had left Ireland to seek the help of the Duke of Lorraine, but because of the enmity of the Duke of Ormonde he was refused permission to return even after the restoration of Charles II. In 1668, French invited his first cousin Luke Wadding to return to Wexford to represent him as Vicar General of Ferns. He appointed him parish priest of New Ross.\"\nDue to the sympathies of the King and his suspension of all anti-Catholic religious persecution through the Declaration of the Indulgence, there was a general relaxation and the Tridentine Mass increasingly moved from outdoor Mass rocks (Irish: Carraig an Aifrinn) to thatched \"Mass houses\" (Irish: C\u00e1b\u00e1n an Aifrinn, lit. \u2018Mass Cabin\u2019). Writing in 1668, Janvin de Rochefort commented, \"Even in Dublin more than twenty houses where Mass is secretly said, and in about a thou",
    "American planter, patriot and politician\nHugh Innes (August 12, 1729 \u2013 March 22, 1797) (sometimes spelled Innis) was an American patriot, attorney, real estate investor and politician who represented Pittsylvania County, Virginia in the House of Burgesses and first Virginia Revolutionary Convention, but whose home was located in Henry County by 1783 (during which he served as delegate for one term alongside the county's namesake and future Governor Patrick Henry) and helped secure the creation of Franklin County.\nEarly and family life\nSources disagree as to whether this man's father was William Innes or James Innes, and his surname is also sometimes spelled \"Innis\"--all of which affect the precise relationship between this man and two orphaned brothers, the sons of Scottish immigrant Rev. Robert Innes of Caroline County: future U.S. District Judge Harry Innes of Kentucky and Virginia attorney general James Innes of Williamsburg. However, all agree that they were related. Their father was either this man's uncle, cousin or half-brother. This man's last will named that Harry Innes (as well as local merchant Samuel Callend) as administrators of the estate and charged them to educate this man's youngest children. During Innes' legislative visits to Williamsburg, the colonial capital, as described below, Innes met Hannah Eggleston, whom he married there (technically in James City County in 1772), and whom he survived. His sons were Robert, Hugh, (another) James and (another) Harry and his surviving daughters were Mrs. Turley and Elizabeth Eggleston Innes.\nCareer\nTrained as a lawyer, after the French and Indian war ended in the 1760s, Innes settled near the Pigg River and Elkhorn River in an area which at the end of his life became the Snow Creek district of Franklin County. It was about 30 or 40 miles from the earliest Pittsylvania county seat at Peytonsburg. Innes was one of the eight landowners who established Pittsylvania County from then-vast Halifax County in 1769, and served as a justice of the peace in that new county, as well as on the Antrim Parish vestry. Henry County was established from Pittsylvania County in 1777; Franklin County would be created in 1785 and Patrick County in 1791. The inventory of Innes's estate in 1798 included land in Franklin County as well as Patrick County and Montgomery County and the new state of Kentucky. Some of it may have reflected a thousand pounds sterling Innes lent to fellow burgess John Donelson mentioned below in 1773, for which Donaldson mortgaged his 1019 acre home plantation in Pittsylvania County (including eighteen slaves) and which he used to construct a bloomery (primitive iron forge) in what became Franklin county.\nMeanwhile, Pittsylvania County voters elected Innes and Donelson (who had moved there from eastern Maryland and would move to Tennessee  in 1779), as their first representatives to the House of Burgesses in 1769, and re-elected both men until what turned out to be the last session of the House of Burgesses in 1774, in which both were replaced, although then all four former burgesses represented Pittsylvania County at the first Virginia Revolutionary Convention. On May 27, 1774, Innes and Donelson, as well as Charles Lynch and Hugh Talbot (of what was then Bedford County but would also become Franklin County) were among the signatories of a nonimportation act. Innes also served a single term in the House of Delegates in 1783 representing Henry County upon its formation (and also served as one of that county's original justices of the peace) and helped secure the creation of Franklin County.\nWhen the Franklin County court met for the first time in January 1786 at the ordinary owned by prominent ironmaker James Callaway, Innes was not present, so his tenure among the first justices of the peace (and coroner) for the new county began a month later, as did the tenure of Robert Williams as the commonwealth attorney for Franklin County. Innes was the eighth wealthiest taxpayer in Franklin County in 1786. He was also among eight storekeepers licensed in 1787. However, Innes' tenure in contentious Franklin County did not prove smooth, for Thomas Arthur (who served in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1787 and 1788 as well as in the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788) and fellow Franklin justice of the peace John Rentfro, in 1786 complained to Governor Patrick Henry that Innes was an improper choice for colonel of the new county's militia because of his short stature, age and supposed lack of demonstrated affection to the patriot cause in the previous war. Having served alongside Innes in the Pittsylvania Committee of Safety, Henry issued the commission nonetheless, and Innes took the oath of office on July 3, 1786.\nIn the 1787 Virginia tax census, Col. Hugh Innis paid taxes in Franklin County for owning six enslaved teenaged Blacks and six Black adults, as well as ten horses and 25 cattle, and was the only taxpayer in the county with that surname.

    "1340 battle in Denmark\nThe Battle of Lunden\u00e6s (Danish: Slaget ved Lunden\u00e6s), also known as the Battle of Skjern River (Danish: Slaget ved Skjern \u00c5) was a military engagement between Holsteinian and Jutish rebel forces on 2 May 1340 possibly at Lunden\u00e6s Castle near Skjern River in the then Holsteinian-held Jutland. The battle ended in a Jutish rebel victory and it is alleged that many Germans died in the Skirmish.\nBackground\nDuring the early 14th century, Denmark was mortgaged off to foreign rulers including Count Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg, who by the 1330s ruled much of Denmark. In 1340, 50 rebelling Jutes under Niels Ebbesen, who were furious with the current regime, assassinated Count Gerhard in Randers. After the assassination, Ebbesen and his men fled south over the Guden\u00e5 and west to the Skjern River.\nBattle\nEbbesen reached Lunden\u00e6s in B\u00f8lling county on 2 May 1340. Here the Holsteinians were concurrently fortifying and building a castle to act as a base against the Danish rebels. Ebbesen and his Jutish men stormed and assaulted the constructions of the fortification in what would be described as a great battle. Ebbesen and the Jutes came out victorious and as a result, many Holsteinians were said to have lost their lives or fled in action, and the Holsteinian attempt to erect a castle failed.\nAftermath\nAfter this battle, Ebbesen and his revolt likely controlled most of Jutland, except the larger castles and cities. Ebbesen and his men may even have participated in the meeting at Viborg and hailed the newly elected Valdemar IV of Denmark the same year. Despite this success, Ebbesen was killed in the Battle of Nonnebjerg the same year.\nPlace of Battle\nThere has been raised uncertainty about the place of the battle. According to the Chronica Jutensis Niels Ebbesen after the killing of Count Gerhard in Randers \"Same year, on 2 May killed ... many Germans at Skjern River, where they were about to build a castle against the Danes\". This has since then been interpreted to take place near Lunden\u00e6s Castle.\nHowever, in 2010 Anders B\u00f8gh and Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen working for Jysk Ark\u00e6ologisk Selskab raised uncertainty about the place of battle. The two writers suggest that the Chronica Jutensis is referring to N\u00f8rre\u00e5 River, which is located between Viborg and Randers.\nConsidering that Niels Ebbesen's other known war activities are linked to East Jutland, where he committed his murder in Randers and fell during the siege of Skanderborg on 2 November 1340, it is quite likely that it was in Skjern parish that the Germans were by building a castle, and that we have the first mention of a castle on the site\u2014\u200aAnders B\u00f8gh & Carsten Porskrog Rasmussen\nThis theory has been met with critique from among others Poul Grinder-Hansen at Nationalmuseet, who argues that B\u00f8gh and Rasmussen do not support their claim efficiently enough. Nevertheless, the battle tells us much about the conditions in Jutland until Valdemar IV took over.\nLegacy\nIn February 1933, Scheel Pousel tried to get Skjern Museumsforeningen to raise a memorial stone for the 600-year jubilee of the Danish victory, however, this would never be accomplished.\nSee also\nGerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg\u00a0\u2013 Count of Holstein-Rendsburg\nSiege of Kolding (1368\u20131369)\u00a0\u2013 Siege in Denmark, 1369\nNiels Ebbesen\u00a0\u2013 Danish folk hero\nSiege of Skanderborg\u00a0\u2013 1340 siege in Denmark\n",
    "\nbefore 1915\nMarita Loersch (born Marie-Luise Beaucamp  25 August 1853 Lyon - 20 June 1915 Aachen ) was a German-French charitable worker, and founding member of several Catholic women's associations.\nLife\nAfter the sudden death of her father, she moved with her mother and three younger brothers to her maternal relatives in Aachen. There she attended the St. Leonhard Higher Girls' School and, after her mother died in 1868, she first went to the Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur girls' boarding school in Paris and, after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, to the Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur boarding school in M\u00fcnster. After one of her brothers was killed in the war, she dropped out of school and moved back to Aachen to look after her two younger brothers. There she met the cloth manufacturer Heinrich Hubert Arthur Loersch (1843\u20131896), a brother of the legal historian Hugo Loersch, and only agreed to marry him on the condition that her two brothers would be accepted into the new family.\nAs her own marriage remained childless and her brothers were adults very soon, she devoted herself to charitable causes. She became a member of the \"Mariannenverein Aachen\", which looked after the Aachen Marianneninstitut and cared for young women who had just given birth in need, as well as the \"Elisabethverein\", which worked voluntarily for women in need, and from 1907 the \" Hildegardis-Verein \", which was concerned with women's studies. She also worked in the so-called \"M\u00e4gdehaus\", which aimed to train, find jobs and temporarily care for girls looking for work. After her husband's death, Loersch also took on the task of visiting and caring for young female prisoners. For many years she also held the office of treasurer of the Patriotic Women's Association in Aachen, which set up rehabilitation aid for war veterans and set up kindergartens. She was also a co-founder of the first day-care centers in Aachen and  Sunday schools for working women. She was also one of the co-founders of the Catholic Women's League, founded in Cologne in 1903, and was elected to its central board several times between 1903 and 1910.\nIn 1900, Loersch helped found a branch of the \"Good Shepherd Association\" in Aachen. In 1901, it was renamed the \"Catholic Welfare Association for Girls and Women\" and in 1903 the \"Catholic Welfare Association for Girls, Women and Children\". Loersch took over the chairmanship of the Aachen local association from 1904.\u00a0At the same time, she had also founded another local association in D\u00fcren in 1902, which joined the overall association in 1906.\nMarita-Loersch-Weg, in Aachen\nIn order to be able to communicate on an equal level with the many ordinary citizens of Aachen and to gain their trust, she studied the Aachen dialect intensively . Throughout her life she maintained close contact with her two surviving brothers, Charles Beaucamp (1855\u20131932), who became a lawyer and legal advisor, and Eug\u00e8ne Beaucamp (1859\u20131936), who became a gynecologist and medical advisor, as well as the director of the Mariannen Institute and co-founder of the hospital in Aachen-Forst .\nLegacy\nA street in Aachen and the youth home of the Catholic welfare association were named after her. Marita Loersch was buried in the Kuetgens family grave in the Aachen Ostfriedhof cemetery .\n",
    "\nOperation Sadejstvo 93 is the code name for the operation of the Army of Republika Srpska in the summer of 1993, in Bosanska Posavina. The operation is also known as the battle for the \"Strujni Corridor\".\nPrelude\nSince the stable and adequate electricity supply of Bosnian Krajina was threatened due to the state of war, the VRS decided to expand the corridor near Br\u010dko in order to include and repair the electric line that passed through the villages of Brod, Donja Brka, Kolonija, Lipovac, \u0110uki\u0107i and Baji\u0107i.\nIn the operation, the VRS engaged units of the 1st Krajina Corps and the East Bosnian Corps, divided into two tactical groups. The first tactical group (TG-1) relied on the Garda Panteri, the special detachment \"Pe\u0161a\" of the 1st Posavina Brigade, the 4th Battalion of the 43rd Prijedor Mtbr, as well as parts of the elite 1st Battalion of the Military Police; TG-1 advanced in the direction of s. Brod and s. Mustache. The second tactical group (TG-2) was led by the 16th Krajina Motorized Brigade and the 5th Kozar lpbr in the direction of s. Baji\u0107i, s. Lipovac and s. Djuki\u0107i. An armored battalion of the First Armored Brigade also participated in the operation; artillery support was provided by the 1st and 3rd mixed artillery regiments.\nThe ARBiH relied on the following brigades during the operation: 21st Srebrenik Brigade, 108th Motorized Brigade and 108th HVO Brigade; all together 12,000 soldiers. The advantage of the defense was reflected in the terrain impassable by tanks (intertwined with canals) and flat area (easy control of enemy infantry attacks). This meant that the armor and maneuverability of the elite infantry units, one of the main strengths of the VRS \u2014was of little or no use from the start. In addition, the VRS could not use the great superiority in artillery due to the density of the enemy's defense (the length of the front was about 15 kilometers, which means that the ARBiH had almost one man per meter in defense); high density allowed defense in depth, that is, more lines. On the other hand, the basic handicap of the ARBiH was the lack of heavy weapons (about 6,000 soldiers only possessed infantry weapons), which condemned the ARBiH to leave the initiative to the attacker in the plains.\nOffensive\nThe operation lasted seven days, from July 20 to 27, and ended successfully. During the first few days of the operation, the advance of VRS forces was weak. The turning point occurred on July 24, when special units of the VRS broke through the  Muslim positions and occupied the villages of Brod and Lipovac. By July 27 and the end of the operation, the VRS conquered the following places: Dizdaru\u0161a, Brod, Kolonija, Lipovac, Omerbegova\u010da and Brk. Thus, the current corridor was secured.\n",
    "\nIsrael Keech Tefft (February 12, 1794 \u2013 June 30, 1862) was an American writer and businessman who was co-founder of the Georgia Historical Society in Savannah, Georgia. \nLife and career\nThe former Tefft family home, at 1 West Jones Street in Savannah, Georgia\nTefft was born in 1794 in Smithfield, Rhode Island. His father died when Israel was around four years old, and his mother relocated so that he could be educated in Boston, Massachusetts.\nIn 1816, he relocated to Savannah, Georgia, and started a hardware business. A year later, he married Penelope Waite Sessions, a native of Thompson, Connecticut, and granddaughter of Darius Sessions, deputy governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. From 1849, the couple lived at the corner of Bull Street and West Jones Street in Savannah.\nTefft fell into heavy debt by December 1818, a month after becoming a father, having had several planned business transactions fail. The business folded during the Panic of 1819.\nWith his friend Henry J. Finn, Tefft became joint editor and manager of Savannah daily newspaper The Georgian and Evening Advertiser in 1821, albeit briefly. He sold his share in the business to George Robertson Jr., who restored the paper's name to The Georgian, and started a new career with the Bank of the State of Georgia in 1822. He was elected its cashier in 1848, and remained in the role until his death.\nAfter departing his newspaper role, Tefft wrote the historical work the Native American. He followed it with The Remains of Henry Denison in 1823. The latter was due to appear as 56 pages within The Columbian Lyre: or Specimens of Transatlantic Poetry in 1828. It was to be published in Glasgow, Scotland, but was abandoned. It instead appeared in the literary periodical The Coronal, which was published in Greenock, Scotland.\nTefft was a first corporal with the Chatham Artillery; he resigned after losing out to William Turner for the role of fourth sergeancy.\nSometime between 1835 and 1845, Cornelius Ver Bryck painted an oil-on-canvas portrait of Tefft.\nIn 1839, Tefft co-founded the Georgia Historical Society, in which he became a close friend of Alexander Smets. Tefft possessed a large library of autographs and manuscripts, which he had begun around the age of 21. His collection of autographs was believed to have been one of the world's rarest. In 1867, William Gilmore Simms arranged a sale in New York City of Tefft's autograph collection for the benefit of his widow.\nDeath\nTefft died in 1862, aged 68, having been ill for around three months. He was interred in Savannah's Laurel Grove Cemetery. His widow, who survived him by eleven years, was buried beside him. The couple survived each of their three children.\n",
    "Milo R. Maltbie, Commissioner of the New York State Public Service Commission\nMilo Roy Maltbie (born Hinckley, Illinois, April 3, 1871; died New York City, New York, December 22, 1962) was an American economist who specialized in public utilities. He is best known for his service as the chairman of the New York Public Service Commission from 1930 to 1949.\nEarly life\nMaltbie was the third of four children of Henry Munson Maltbie (1836\u20131902) and his wife Harriet Delano Maltbie (1840\u20131915). He graduated from Upper Iowa University in 1892, received a Ph.B at Northwestern University in 1893 and a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1897. He taught economics and mathematics at Mount Morris College in Mount Morris, Illinois from 1893 to 1895. From 1895 to 1897 Maltbie was a fellow in administrative law at Columbia.\nHe was a student of legal scholar Frank Johnson Goodnow there and contributed an article to a 1935 volume of essays in his honor.\nCareer\nMaltbie had become interested in municipal governance; in 1897 he published English Local Government of Today, A Study of the Relations of Central and Local Governments. From 1897 to 1902 Maltbie was the secretary of the City Reform Club in New York City; he travelled to Europe in 1899 to study the problems of municipal governance. He was also the editor of Municipal Affairs, the quarterly publication of the club on civic reform. In 1898 the club published his Municipal Functions\u00a0; A Study of the Development, Scope and Tendency of Municipal Socialism. In 1901 he edited and contributed to a study of the street railways of Chicago; in the introduction he was referred to as \"...a well-known writer on municipal and economic subjects...\" Starting in 1901 Maltbie, building on the work of Henry Carter Adams on railroads, developed the idea of the \"uniform system of accounts\" for utilities, legally-required standards of accounting that required utilities to keep separate detailed records for each distinct part of their operations.\nFrom 1902 to 1907 Maltbie was the secretary of the New York City Art Commission. After another visit to Europe he wrote a report on \"Civic Art in Northern Europe: A Report to the Art Commission of the City of New York\" in 1903.\nIn June 1907 Maltbie was appointed to the newly created New York Public Utilities Commission, first division (Greater New York City), by governor Charles Evans Hughes. He was reappointed by successive governors until 1915. In 1916 he was appointed chamberlain of New York City by reform mayor John Purroy Mitchel.\nMaltbie was frequently called upon to consult on utility rates and testify in court proceedings involving rate setting. Maltbie served as an advisor to the Federal Electric Railways Commission (1919\u20131920).\nIn 1930 Maltbie was appointed as chairman of the reconstituted statewide New York Public Service Commission by governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a post he held until 1949.\nFamily\nMaltbie married Lucia McCosh (1869\u20131957) in 1901; they had no children.\nLegacy\nMaltbie donated over $500,000 to his alma mater Upper Iowa University in 1960 to build Maltbie-McCosh Hall, a men's dormitory.

    "Lifeboat station in Troon, United Kingdom\nPortpatrick Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboats at Portpatrick in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It opened in 1877 and today operates an all-weather lifeboat.\nHistory\nLifeboat stations had been established at Port Logan and Ballantrae by 1871 but on 15 December 1877 one was opened in between them at Portpatrick at the request of local people for the protection of the numerous vessels passing that port as well as for the benefit of the fishing-boats of the place when overtaken by sudden gales of wind. A boathouse was built at a cost of \u00a3280 but the lifeboat was launched by lowering it from a davit. The station's first lifeboat was wrecked in 1899 when it fell 14\u00a0ft (4.3\u00a0m) from the davit.\nThe first lifeboats were 'pulling and sailing', that is they were powered by rowing or with sails. The RNLI started to experiment with petrol motor lifeboats in the early 1900s and one of the first, the Maria came to Portpatrick in 1922 after serving at Broughty Ferry since 1910. Diesel engines were tried in the 1930s and Portpatrick was one of the stations selected for comparative trials of the new engines. It was found that theirs could cruise for 57 nautical miles (106\u00a0km) while using 64 imperial pints (36\u00a0L) of petrol but another lifeboat with a different engine at Yarmouth achieved 118\u00a0nmi (219\u00a0km) with just 29\u00a0imp\u00a0pt (16\u00a0L).\nThe RNLI started to deploy inshore lifeboats in the 1960s. One was placed at a new lifeboat station in Stranraer in 1971 but the all-weather lifeboat remains at Portpatrick.\nService awards\nThe lifeboat was called out on 15 December 1913 to rescue the crew of five from the SS Dunira which was being blown onto rocks in a storm. Coxswain James Smith was awarded an RNLI Silver Medal for his skill in getting the lifeboat alongside the stricken steam ship.\nThe SS Camlough developed engine trouble near the Isle of Man on 12 January 1932. The captain decided to return to his home port, Belfast, but a gale got up the next day and the ship was blown towards the Scottish coast. Another ship came to the Camlough's aid and took it in tow but the line kept breaking. The Portpatrick lifeboat arrived and monitored the situation. When the tow broke again, the Camlough put down its anchors but they didn't hold and it was swept towards some rocks. The lifeboat swung into action and saved the ten crew, one of whom fell into the sea between the lifeboat and the ship and was in danger of being crushed but was hauled to safety by the coxswain. It was now 14 January and the lifeboat was away from Portpatrick for 12 hours. The coxswain, John Campbell, received an RNLI Bronze Medal for this service.\nMemorial to the Princess Victoria\nThe stern-loading car ferry Princess Victoria left nearby Stranraer on its regular crossing to Larne in Northern Ireland on the morning of 31 January 1953. A storm was building and soon after reaching more open water its stern doors were damaged by heavy waves and it started to take on water. The Portpatrick lifeboat was launched and was later joined by the lifeboats from Donaghadee, Cloughey and Newcastle. The car ferry sank at about 2 o'clock but there was confusion about its precise location and the lifeboat did not reach the wreck until more than an hour later by which time the storm had developed into a hurricane. The Portpatrick crew rescued 2 people and took them to Donaghadee, and the lifeboat from that harbour saved 31. When the ferry had left Stranraer there had been 127 passengers and 49 crew on board; this is regarded as one of the worst disasters in British coastal waters in the twentieth century. The Portpatrick lifeboat returned to her station on the afternoon of 1 February, more than a day after launching into the storm. Its coxswain, William McConnell, was awarded an RNLI Bronze Medal and a British Empire Medal.\nThe whole crew received a collective 'Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman' for their teamwork, seamanship and determination when they took the lifeboat out in a Force 10 to rescued the crew of three from a fishing vessel\u00a0which was sinking on 23 November 1995.\nPortpatrick lifeboats\n'ON' is the Official Number used in RNLI records from 1884. 'Op. No.' is the Operational Number displayed on the boat.\n47-033 Mary Irene Millar\n16-21 John Buchanan Barr\nSee also\nList of RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n",
    "Football tournament\nThe Copa Rodr\u00edguez Arzuaga (Spanish: Rodr\u00edguez Arzuaga Cup was a friendly football competition contested by clubs from Madrid which ran from 1910 until 1913. It was named in honor of the donator of the trophy, Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Arzuaga, one of the founders of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\nAll editions of the competition were held in league form, with the winner being the one who, in the end, obtained the greatest number of points. The registration was open to all Madrid clubs of the time, with the city's biggest clubs, especially Madrid FC, often competing with their second and third teams. The four most important Madrid clubs participated in its inaugural edition in 1910, which was held between January and February. The first third editions were won by Sociedad Gimn\u00e1stica while the second and fourth were won by Madrid FC and Atl\u00e9tico respectively. In the fourth and last edition in 1914, Madrid FC refused to participate.\nNotably, Atl\u00e9tico played its first game as a red and white team in the second edition of this competition on 22 January 1911. Notable figures of this tournament are Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, Pichichi, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier and Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara.\nCopa Rodr\u00edguez Arzuaga I\nIn the inaugural edition, the four most important Madrid clubs of that time participated, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Madrid FC, Espa\u00f1ol de Madrid, and Sociedad Gimn\u00e1stica, which was held between January and February and contested by the first, second and third teams of each club. It was won by Gimn\u00e1stica with 13 points (6 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses) followed by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid with 8 points (4 wins and 4 losses), Madrid FC with 7 points (3 wins, 1 draw and 4 losses) and Espa\u00f1ol at 6 points (3 wins and 6 losses).\nResults\nCopa Rodr\u00edguez Arzuaga II\nThe second edition of the Rodr\u00edguez Arzuaga was contested by the first, second, and third teams of Madrid FC, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, and Sociedad Gimn\u00e1stica, and held at the Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico fields in front of an enthusiastic and large audience. On 22 January 1911, Atl\u00e9tico debuted its new clothing, the now famous red\u2013and\u2013white shirts, in a match against Gimn\u00e1stica at the Campo del Retiro. The match was not finished because Gimn\u00e1stica left the field after the referee validated an athletic goal that meant the victory of the red and whites. Madrid won the Cup with 9 points (3 wins and 3 draws) ahead of Atl\u00e9tico with 7 points (2 wins, 3 draws and 1 loss), and Gimn\u00e1stica with 2 points (2 draws and losses).\nNotably, in the meeting between the first teams of Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico played on 30 January, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw, Atl\u00e9tico's goalkeeper Luis Astorquia, after saving a shot from Luis Saura, took the ball and avoided the opposing forwards to reach almost half the field with it, but immediately afterwards, Madrid retrieved it and threw it towards Astorquia's goal again, where almost all of Madrid's forwards were fighting with Athletic's defenders, which gave enough time to Astorquia to run from midfield and arriving on goal at the same moment that they shoot, producing a save that drew thunderous cheers from the spectators.\nOn 19 November 1911, the Copa Juli\u00e1n Ruete was held for the first time, organized by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The results for the host team were a one\u2013goal tie with the first team of Madrid FC and a 3\u20130 victory over the second team of Gimn\u00e1stica, both matches played on the Ciudad Lineal field.\nResults\nCopa Rodr\u00edguez Arzuaga III\nThe third edition of the Copa Rodr\u00edguez Arzuaga was held in January and February 1912, and it was played between the first, second, and third teams of the four most important clubs in the capital. Gimn\u00e1stica won the title after a close fight with Espa\u00f1ol, while Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico performed at a level well below their usual level.\nResults\nCopa Rodr\u00edguez Arzuaga III\nThe fourth and last edition was held in April 1913 and was contested only by Atl\u00e9tico, Espa\u00f1ol, and Cardenal Cisneros Club. It was won by its organizers, Atl\u00e9tico, who defeated the other two sides.\nResults\nSee also\nUEFA Regions' Cup\n",
    "Valentine Thomas was an English servant or soldier whose confession in 1598 as a would-be assassin of Elizabeth I caused tension between England and Scotland.\nValentine Thomas said a door keeper had given him access to James VI at Holyrood Palace\nArrest and confession\nA Scottish man captured in England, Robert Crawforth, gave testimony that prompted Thomas's arrest. He described meeting Thomas and the usher or door keeper John Stewart at Holyrood Palace in 1597. John Stewart gave Thomas access to the palace and James VI. James had another servant of that name, John Stewart of Rosland, usually identified as a valet. Crawforth, who was transferred to the Marshalsea prison in London, described one aspect of the conspiracy, that Valentine Thomas had offered to engage the support of English Catholics to put James on the English throne.\nThomas was arrested in Morpeth, following Crawforth's statement, in March 1598. He was taken to the Marshalsea and then questioned in the Tower of London. He had used alias surnames of Anderson and Alderson. Thomas claimed to have had access to the Scottish royal court via John Stewart, an usher or keeper of the king's chamber door. He said that he had heard James VI wish that William Cecil, the English Lord Treasurer was dead. Thomas said he offered to kill Cecil, and after further discussion, James suggested he should stab Queen Elizabeth while delivering a petition. It was said that Thomas's confessions also described a meeting at Linlithgow Palace.\nIn his description of the conversation, Thomas said he told James that he was to attend the wedding of a kinsman in Glasgow, and James responded mentioning \"Sorley Boy\", meaning James MacDonald, a brother of Angus MacDonald of Dunyvaig. Thomas also mentioned the Campbell laird of Ardkinglas at Holyroodhouse. James MacDonald was understood to be a kinsman of Sorley Boy MacDonnell, who had been regarded by Elizabeth I as rebel in Ireland.\nDiplomacy\nAlthough it is unlikely that James VI had instructed Valentine Thomas to assassinate Elizabeth and Cecil, and the allegations were not widely believed, the situation embarrassed James VI. He hoped to succeed Elizabeth (he gained her throne in 1603). Elizabeth had passed laws against plotters in 1585, with an Act of Safety which might work against the Scottish king's ambition.\nAn English diplomat in Edinburgh, George Nicolson, discovered that James VI had heard of Thomas's confession in April and believed Elizabeth I kept it secret in order to use it against him in the future. Nicolson wrote that James was \"much troubled and grieved, albeit in secret sort\". One of James's councillors, Edward Bruce, advised that Elizabeth would not believe he was at fault. Other courtiers suggested that Bruce made such suggestions because Elizabeth had given him a rich gold chain as a reward.\nNicolson worried that the ambassadors Peter Young and David Cunningham, Bishop of Aberdeen, sent by James VI to Denmark and to German princes in the wake of the visit of Anne of Denmark's brother the Duke of Holstein to request their future support for his succession to the throne of England would now spread news of \"griefs and slanders\" suffered by James because of the Valentine Thomas affair.\nIt was reported in June 1598 that James VI had been told that William Cecil thought the issue was of low importance, that Thomas was \"but a knave\" and could be released. Edward Bruce told George Nicolson that James was still displeased by the affair, focussing on the failure of the English ambassador William Bowes to keep him informed. James thought the business should have been made open, \"kindly discovered\", to Bowes and himself.\nJames prepared to send diplomats including David Foulis to London to try and resolve the situation, and ensure that the king's honour was not dented. On 1 July 1598, Elizabeth I wrote to James that she would \"make the deviser have his desert\" more for impuning James than his other misdemeanours. Thomas was found guilty of plotting with \"Pickering of the North\" to rebel with Catholic recusants.\nJames VI was informed that Valentine Thomas had written a poem with charcoal on a chimney breast at the Tower of London:I shot at a fair white: And in loosing of my arrowMy elbow was wrested. But I melt for griefTo lose such a game: having so fair a mark.But if I had escaped that wrest, God knoweth without all peradventureI had won that game: To the great comfort of EnglandAnd profit of myself.\nJames wrote to Elizabeth on 30 July that the \"foggy mists of groundless calumnies\" were clearing. He hoped that Thomas's execution could be delayed until he was fully satisfied that he was exonerated in the \"minds of all men\". Nicolson told him that Thomas was still alive in August.\nIn September, David Foulis discussed the affair the Privy Council of England at Greenwich Palace with reference to the \"Act of Association\". The Council insisted Elizabeth I had not tried to slander James using Thomas's confession, and they beli",

Equally high production value as Mainstage shows.\nUnlike other performance groups, casting is not guaranteed for those who audition for Marquee shows. Two performances every year (one before 2011).\nPrograms\nTheater As Digital Activity (TADA!)\nIn 1996, CMT started an online program to allow children from around the world to collaborate and fully create musicals to be produced by CMT and performed by their members. The program ended after its last production in 2003.\nA website called ConvoNation, which was a communications platform for sick and disabled children created by Apple\u2019s Worldwide Disabilities Solutions Group, collaborated with CMT to create TADA's first project, the original musical \"Pulse: The Rhythm of Life.\" It was released and performed in 1998, featuring Alex Brightman in a lead role. In 1999 PBS made a documentary about the development of Pulse, hosted by Annette Benning.\nOther projects developed under the TADA program included Our Tree: The Family Chronicles, released in May 2000, 2101 in 2001, A Little Princess in 2002 and Persephone in 2003. Of these, three were written and composed in part by Richard Link.\nClasses and Workshops\nCMT offers classes for recital, dance, acting, improv, vocal and auditions for ages ranging from 4 to 20. Occasionally, professional guest artists are brought in to teach classes. The following notable artists have taught or presented at CMT: Thomas Schumacher, theatrical producer,  Anthony Rapp, broadway & film actor, Jason Robert Brown and Drew Gasparini, broadway composers and Jacob Brent, actor and choreographer.\nCMT alumni have also returned in a teaching capacity, including Alex Brightman, Aaron Albano and Matt Hill, among others.\nEvents\nCMT San Jose holds the following annual events:\nGala \u2013 Fundraising event early in  the year during which alumni and current performers put on multiple show numbers during a brunch and dinner.

In November 1985 it was transferred to the General Logistics Department of the PLA and renamed the \"First Strategic Rear Base of the General Logistics Department\" (MUCD Unit 59191).  In March 1994, the First Strategic Rear Base of the Base Command of the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and its affiliated warehouses in Henan Province were transferred to the Logistics Department of the Jinan Military Region and renamed the 33rd Logistics Branch of the PLA (Unit 55201).

    "\nEthiopia Street (during the British Mandate period and even afterwards: Abyssinian street or Habashim Street) is a street in the center of Jerusalem, branching off from HaNevi'im Street, and parallel to the nearby B'nai B'rith Street.\nThe Uniqueness of the Street\nEthiopia Street is an extension of Prophets Street and together they form an axis that connects the east of the city with its west, the old city with the new city, and the secular city with the ultra-Orthodox city. This traffic axis constitutes a historical, architectural, and religious complex with unique characteristics and embodies an important part of the chronology and essence of the city's construction. The traffic axis of Prophets Street begins at Damascus Gate in the old city, from where it ascends westward until it connects with Jaffa Street at Davidka Square. Approximately in its middle, Ethiopia Street branches off northward. The pedestrian walking along the street up the traffic axis sees unique historical evidence of 19th-century and early 20th-century architecture. Ethiopia Street contains institutions and residential buildings that together create an exceptional urban fabric.\nHistorical Background\nThe connection of Ethiopia Street to Prophets Street, which serves as a central traffic artery into the western part of the city, naturally turned the entire area into one of the first development and construction zones outside the walls. During the Ottoman period, the street was nothing more than a dirt path, but with the British conquest of Jerusalem in 1917, a development boom began, from which the small street also benefited. Construction on Ethiopia Street began in the 19th century by representatives of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II. Menelik's wife, Taitu Betul, and his senior minister, Ras Makonnen, built more than a dozen buildings in what began to be called \"Habashim Street.\" Two buildings that serve as landmarks of Ethiopian construction on Ethiopia Street and the entire area are Kidane Mehret - the Ethiopian Church, and the Ethiopian Consulate building on Prophets Street, which was established in 1928.\nThe Ethiopian Community\nChristian Ethiopians have a deep connection to Jerusalem. The Christian church belongs to the Oriental Orthodox branch of Christianity. According to the belief of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Ethiopia is the new Zion, and the Ethiopian royal family, according to the national ethos, belongs to the seed of King Solomon.\nEthiopian monks probably resided in Jerusalem as early as the fifth century. Initially, they resided within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre but were expelled from there and founded the Deir al-Sultan Monastery adjacent to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1884, at the initiative of Emperor Yohannes, the construction of the Kidane Mehret Church (Covenant of Mercy) began on a plot called Debre Genet (Mount of Paradise), in the center of the Ethiopian compound adjacent to Prophets Street. In 1930, when Ras Tafari Haile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia, the ties between the Ethiopian monarchy and Jerusalem were strengthened. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered by Mussolini's army and was under Italian control until 1941. Selassie himself fled with the conquest and arrived in Jerusalem, as well as in Geneva, to speak before the League of Nations. After about three months in Jerusalem, he moved to England. The Ethiopian community in Jerusalem was a humiliated and oppressed community for hundreds of years. Its exit outside the walls and the foothold it gained in the new city and on Ethiopia Street marked the intensification of religious feelings in the renewed Ethiopia and among the community's representatives in the country.\nThe Street Name\nInitially, the entire area was named after the community - the Habashim neighborhood. The street name was determined at the end of the 19th century when the Ethiopian Church was built on the street, and during the Mandate period, the street was named Abyssinian Street, the Latin name of the country known as Habash (and in a distorted form, Abys). Since the name Habash - which originates from Arabic and means \"a mixture of tribes\" - was considered a name that does not include all Ethiopian citizens but only the Semitic-speaking citizens, the street name was changed in December 1968 to Ethiopia Street.\nNotable buildings\nEthiopia 1 / HaNevi'im 58 - Tabor House\nMain article: Tabor House (Jerusalem)\nTabor House was inaugurated in 1889 as the residence of German archaeologist and architect Conrad Schick (1822\u20131902). Above the entrance to the house, Schick, a Protestant, inscribed the name THABOR inspired by Book of Psalms (Chapter 89, Verse 13): \"The north and the south, thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.\" The house's style combines German architecture with Eastern motifs. The house is surrounded by a Jerusalem stone wall with an entrance gate reminiscent of a German medieval fortress gate, complete with a small watchtower. Sinc",

    "Augustinian canon of Groenendael Priory\nStart of De mystieke mondkus\nWilhelm Jordaens (Latin: Wilhelmus Jordani; died 23 November 1372) was an Augustinian canon of Groenendael Priory who wrote in both Latin and Middle Dutch and also translated the Dutch works of the mystic Jan van Ruysbroeck.\nLife\nJordaens was born in Brussels. He was of noble birth, being the son of Jordaen van Heerzele, a cupbearer of Duchess Jeanne of Brabant, and his wife Katherine. His birth has been dated to 1321\u20131322, but this is highly speculative. He probably received his primary education in the liberal arts at the cathedral of Saint Gudula. He was an ordained priest and a magister when he joined Groenendael around 1350, probably having completed his education at the University of Paris.\nThe only sure dates in his life are provided by his obituary in the necrology of Groenendael. These are 1358, when he wrote a lament for a deceased deacon, and 1372, the date of his death. The date of his death was 23 November.\nWorks\nJordaens wrote a planctus (lament) on the death of a deacon in 1358, Planctus super obitu fratris Johannis de Speculo, alias de Cureghem.\nJordaens translated at least four of Jan van Ruysbroeck's works from Middle Dutch into Latin:\nThe Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage\nThe Seven Steps of the Ladder of Spiritual Love\nThe Spiritual Tabernacle\nThe Spiritual Espousals\nHe also translated Henry Suso's Hundred Articles on the Passion from a Middle Dutch version.\nJordaens also wrote his own vernacular mystical works in the tradition of Ruysbroeck. His Avellana (or Conflictus virtutum et viciorum) is a debate between the virtues and the vices in the form of a dream vision with elements of an estates satire. The sole surviving manuscript of the Avellana, formerly of the Rouge Clo\u00eetre, is now found in the Austrian National Library, Codex Series nova 12828. This contains the Latin text, although a scribal note indicates that the poem written in both Latin and Middle Dutch.\nDe mystieke mondkus, also known by the Latin titles De oris osculo (The Kiss of the Mouth) and De osculo amoris (The Kiss of Love), is a mystical treatise in Middle Dutch. It is preserved in two manuscripts and is considered a masterpiece of 14th-century Dutch literature and of later medieval spirituality. It presents a person's relationship with God as a courtship progressing to a kiss on the mouth.\nNotes\n^ a b c \u00d6nnerfors 1986, pp.\u00a07\u20138.\n^ a b c Desoer 1977, p.\u00a013.\n^ a b c d e Johnson 1985, p.\u00a01.\n^ a b Colledge 1969.\n^ Johnson 1985, pp.\u00a01\u20132.\n^ Johnson 1985, p.\u00a033.\n^ Ruh 2000, p.\u00a0707.\n^ Van Nieuwenhove 2014, p.\u00a0216.\n^ a b Van Nieuwenhove, Faesen & Rolfson 2008, p.\u00a01.\nBibliography\nColledge, Edmund (1969). \"Review of Reypens 1967\".

    "\nFukunaga attending the opening ceremony at the 28th annual Tokyo International Film Festival in 2015\nThe following is a list of unproduced Cary Joji Fukunaga projects in roughly chronological order. Over the course of his career, American filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga has ammased a number of projects he worked on that never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects fell in development hell or were cancelled, while others were taken over and would see life under a different production team.\n2000s\nUntitled musical film\nAs early as January 2009, Fukunaga was reported to be developing a musical as a next possible film following Sin nombre. Further details were revealed in March, when he said was collaborating with Zach Condon of Beirut and Owen Pallett to write the music for the film, with the intention to \" narrative forward through song in a way that the songs aren't ruined.\" Fukunaga modeled his script after the Babylonian tale of Pyramus and Thisbe, and was working on the project for Focus Features. Fukunaga had since described it as \"an urban-set film about unrequited love  a road trip component.\"\nUntitled Pompeii film\nAt the same time as the musical,  Fukunaga was working on a \"tragic love story\" set in Pompeii, for Universal Pictures. \"I went down to Napoli, researched at Herculaneum and Pompeii. It took me two weeks,\" he said. \"In two weeks, I got enough information to tear apart that movie frame-by-frame.\"\nUntitled time travel film\nOn March 19, 2009, Fukunaga was said to be developing a science fiction feature, also for Universal. On March 26, 2009, The Playlist gathered that the project would center on time travel and also be \"very human character piece that will transcend the genre.\"\nA Soldier of the Great War\nFukunaga revealed in 2014 that he had been working with Edward Norton on an adaptation of Mark Helprin's A Soldier of the Great War for \"almost five years\" and that they \"want to do it as soon as possible.\" Fukunaga was still writing the adaptation as of 2016.\n2010s\nThe Foldings\nOn May 7, 2011, screenwriter Jeff Vintar tweeted that Fukunaga was in talks to direct his sci-fi script Spaceless for producer Gore Verbinski and Universal. In August, it was officially reported that Fukunaga would direct the film, as well as rewrite the screenplay. In 2013, Fukunaga confirmed that the project was still being developed, and that he had retitled it The Foldings, following several rewrites. \"Because I kept rewriting it and it kept changing and changing, the story is so different from the original, that it metamorphosed,\" he said. \"It's its own thing.\"\nNo Blood, No Guts, No Glory\nOn May 24, 2011, Variety reported that Fukunaga was hired by Focus Features to co-write (with Chase Palmer) and direct No Blood, No Guts, No Glory, a heist film set during the Civil War. The project, previously set up at Paramount, appeared on The Black List in 2009 and was based on the real-life commando mission. In 2012, Fukunaga told the Financial Times, \"It is a version of Buster Keaton's The General, which was based on a real train heist, but told from the Yankee side.\" By 2013 however, he was no longer working on it. Palmer would reveal in 2019 that the project had \"an endless array of directors attached over the years,\" before expressing interest in directing it himself.\nThe Wolverine\nMain article: The Wolverine (film)\nVariety also indicated that Fukunaga had been in contention to direct The Wolverine for 20th Century Fox at the time, before choosing to focus on No Blood, No Guts, No Glory as a project instead.\nIt Chapter One and It Chapter Two\nMain articles: It (2017 film) and It Chapter Two\nIn June 2012, Warner Bros. chose Fukunaga as the director of its adaptations of Stephen King's It, the first of which was initially due to start shooting in summer 2015. Fukunaga was set to direct the first film and was expected to co-write the second. With the help of writer Chase Palmer, Fukunaga developed the script for the first film, inserting a lot of their own childhoods into the story and updating the initial setting from the 1950s to the 1980s. But by May 2015, three weeks before production was slated to begin, Fukunaga left the project, citing that the studio did not trust him with the material.\nSpectre\nMain article: Spectre (2015 film)\nBefore Fukunaga was hired to direct the James Bond film No Time to Die, he had been considered as a potential candidate for the previous entry in the series, Spectre. When Sam Mendes was signed to direct it, Fukunaga expressed his interest to Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson in directing future installments.\nThe Noble Assassin\nIn August 2013, DreamWorks Pictures attached Fukunaga to direct a film adaptation of the unpublished book The Noble Assassin by Paul Nix, which tells the wartime story of French aristocrat-turned-anti-Nazi saboteur Robert de La Rochefoucauld. In 2014, Scott Silver was brought on to adapt the work, and in 2016, writers Ad",

    "Football club\nSportfreunde Oesede (officially: Sportfreunde Oesede \u2013 Georgsmarienh\u00fctte e.V.) is a German football club based in Georgsmarienh\u00fctte, Lower Saxony. The club's first team played in the highest amateur league of Lower Saxony between 1953 and 1958 and participated in the DFB-Pokal once.\nHistory\nThe club was founded in 1921 and only played at the local level until the end of World War II. In 1949, Sportfreunde were among the founding members of the then third-class Amateurliga 2 (Amateur League 2). In 1953, the team won the championship and gained promotion to the Amateuroberliga Niedersachsen-West (Upper Amateur League of Lower Saxony West). Two years later, the club achieved its best placement of this era, finishing seventh. This period ended in 1958 with the club's relegation as the last-placed team.\nUntil the dissolution of the Amateurliga Niedersachsen (Amateur League of Lower Saxony) in 1964, Sportfreunde played in the Amateurliga 8. The qualification for the newly created Verbandsliga West (Regional League West) was missed, and the club had to continue playing in the Bezirksliga Osnabr\u00fcck (District League Osnabr\u00fcck). It was not until 1974 that Sportfreunde gained promotion to the Verbandsliga West. After four years, they were relegated back to the district level, before qualifying for the Bezirksliga Weser-Ems S\u00fcd (District League Weser-Ems South) in 1979. Two years later, Sportfreunde were relegated to the Bezirksklasse (District Class).\nAfter finishing as runners-up in 1983, the club managed to gain promotion to the Bezirksliga (District League) the following year. There, the became runners-up in 1985, narrowly missing out on promotion. A year later, they finished as runners-up again, this time behind the second team of VfB Oldenburg. In 1988, under coach Herbert M\u00fchlenberg, the club finally gained promotion to the Bezirksoberliga Weser-Ems (District Premier League Weser-Ems), before earning a further promotion to the fifth-tier Landesliga West (State League West) the following year. In 1992, the team narrowly missed out on the league title under coach Vitomir Rogoznica. Two years later, Sportfreunde qualified for the Oberliga Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony Premier League). Also in 1994, the team first won the district cup with a 4:2 win against Amisia Papenburg and later the Niedersachsencup . This qualified them for the DFB Pokal. In front of 13,000 spectators at the Osnabr\u00fccker Bremer Br\u00fccke, Sportfreunde, coached by former international player Erwin Kostedde, lost 1:6 in the first round to Bundesliga club Karlsruher SC.\nIn the 1995/96 season, Sportfreunde reached their sporting zenith with fourth place in the Lower Saxony League West. A year later, there was a major break when the board was no longer willing to finance high-paying football. Halfway through the season, the entire team was given permission to change clubs. With just twelve points and 113 goals conceded, Sportfreunde were relegated as bottom of the table in the 1996/97 season and were relegated to the lower division in the following 1997/98 regional league season, in which the team remained winless. After being relegated for the third time in a row, Sportfreunde Oesede finally reached the district league in 1999. The low point of the 1998/99 district league season was a 0:11 defeat at TV Dinklage. But in 2001, Sportfreunde were runners-up in the district league behind Eintracht Neuenkirchen , but failed in the promotion round against BV Essen . One year later, the team was promoted to the district league, which was followed in 2003 by promotion to the Weser/Ems regional league.\nThe team only narrowly missed out on a third promotion in a row, but Sportfreunde Oesede finished third in the 2003/04 season, two points behind champions VfL Oldenburg. Five years later, the team was relegated from the league, which had since been renamed the Bezirksoberliga Weser/Ems , and voluntarily withdrew to the Kreisliga Osnabr\u00fcck-Land, Group South . The reason for this was the departure of almost the entire team. The previous second team of Sportfreunde became the new first team.\n",

    "2024 train collision in the Czech Republic\nOn 5 June 2024, at 10:49\u00a0p.m., a train collision in Pardubice, Czech Republic occurred in the vicinity of Pardubice main railway station, near the Pardubice centrum station. Express train number RJ 1021 of the RegioJet company heading from Prague to Ko\u0161ice (3 cars should continue as RJ 1222 to Chop) collided with freight express train number Nex 41340 of the railway operator \u010cD Cargo. Subsequently, both trains derailed and as a result of the crash, four people died and another 22 were injured.\nOver 300 people were traveling in the express train. The freight train was carrying calcium carbide, but the first two cars were empty.\nBackground\nPardubice is situated on one of the most important railway corridors in the Czech Republic, specifically on the Prague to \u010cesk\u00e1 T\u0159ebov\u00e1, and as such is used by trains heading towards Ostrava, Brno, Vienna, Budapest, Ko\u0161ice and Warsaw (eastbound) and towards Prague, Plze\u0148 and Dresden (westbound), among many others. Starting from 2021, the station underwent a major reconstruction program, the largest of its kind in over 60 years, which involved adding European Train Control System (ETCS), track remodelling works and the replacement of all adjacent infrastructure. By 2024 most of the works were finished but the ETCS system was not planned to be turned on until January 2025, and the previous MIREL safety system had also been turned off, therefore according to Czech railway regulations, drivers had to follow the signal aspects and travel at no faster than 100\u00a0km/h.\nThe first train was RJ 1021 from Praha hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed to Ko\u0161ice, with three through cars to Chop, Ukraine. The train was exclusively made up of couchette cars and regular first and second class cars. On the night of the crash, it was pulled by a Bombardier Traxx MS3 locomotive. The freight train (number Nex 41340) was pulled by a \u010cD Class 363 locomotive, number 363 529-9 followed by several flat wagons with containers.\nReactions\nTransport Minister Martin Kupka and Interior Minister V\u00edt Raku\u0161an visited the scene of the crash. Prime Minister Petr Fiala described the collision as a great tragedy and expressed his condolences to the families of the victims.\n",

    "American musician (1967\u20132024)\nDavid John Legg (8 June 1967\u00a0\u2013 8 March 2024), known professionally as Brother Dege and Dege Legg was an American singer, songwriter, and musician of rock and blues.\nEarly life\nFrom Cajun-French and Irish ancestry, Legg was born and raised in southern Louisiana. His parents were Anne and John Legg, lieutenant colonel from the United States Air Force. They moved a lot and lived in Northern California and Georgia. His parents broke up so he and his mother came back to Louisiana.\nHe had a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Louisiana State University. He also discovered  Henry Miller, Charles Bukowski, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Beat Generation's writers.\nHe listened 1970s and 1980s rock and roll\u00a0: Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Jimi Hendrix, ACDC, le blues de Blind Willie Johnson, Son House, Robert Johnson, Bukka White and lyrics of Tom Waits and Bob Dylan. He taught himself how to play guitar and wrote his first songs.\nLegg suffered of chronic depression and drug dependence. After a suicide attempt in the Mississippi from a bridge he decided to go to rehab.\nCareer\nAn underground artist (1994\u20132012)\nIn 1994, Legg with his initials DJ chose \"Dege Legg\" as his professional name. He formed the band Santeria as a singer with other musicians\u00a0: Primo (guitare), Krishna Kasturi (drum), Chad Willis (bass) and Rob Rushing (percussion). During ten years the band self-released on his own label four albums and became one of the southern underground band. The band dissolved in 2008.\nTo support his artistic projects, Legg worked many odd jobs\u00a0: cabdriver, machinist, caseworker in a homeless shelter, delivery driver, dishwasher, tire mechanic, cook, journalist at The Independent and won the Louisiana Press Award in 2004 and 2008 for his article about Homelessness in Lafayette.\nLegg varied the musical experiences by joining C. C. Adcock's touring band as second guitarist in The Lafayette Marquis and he formed the new band Black Bayou Construkt and released the album Kingdoms of Folly in 2009. After several solo albums he continued to play solo tour as \"Brother Dege\". During ten years he wrote the album Folk songs of the American Longhair and recorded in non-traditional spaces\u00a0: elevator shafts, open fields, abandoned houses before recording the tracks at home. After that he  worked with professionals to mix and master his albums. Brother Dedge described his music as psyouthern (psychedelic and southern) because in his country the energy was \"dark and spooky\". David Maine of PopMatters said the album was ranged \"from quietly desperate to careening full-tilt boogie\" with slide guitar, Southern gothic and rock and roll. For Walter Pierce of The Independent, Kingdoms of Folly was a \"musical departure from the dark, Southern tribalism of Santeria\". For KLOF Magazine \"the album tunnels into the ancient mysteries of pre-war blues and its devil-obsessed masters\". Brother Dege, called by the press \"the best kept secrets in the Deep South\" went in solo tour in America with a dobro and for the first time in Europe (Belgium and Netherland). The producers of American reality television series Deadliest Catch licensed the song Hard Row to Hoe.\nWorldwide recognition (2013\u20132024)\nQuentin Tarantino heard at Sirius XM the song Too Old to Die Young and wanted it in his movie's score Django Unchained. Tarantino said\u00a0: \"every track could have been in the movie\". The movie was a great success. Tarantino won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the music was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media. About this participation Brother Dege declared\u00a0: \"I couldn\u2019t ask for a better director to be interested in my music.  People associate Quentin with a bold cinematic aesthetic and his exquisite taste in music\"\nIn 2013 Brother Dege released the new album How to kill a horse. To Robert Gluck of The Aquarian he was emerged into the spotlight with the same attention as The Black Keys and  Gary Clark, Jr.. In 2015 the album Scorched Earth Policy was atypical because he mixed new songs \"haunting and catchy compositions\" for OffBeat, old demos, covers (Black Sabbath, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc). To Blues Rock Review the album was full of surprises with \"undertones of funky, psychedelic production techniques such as echoing background vocals and spacey, saturated drums\". Brother Dege toured with his new band The Brethren founded in 2013.\nIn 2018 his concept album Farmer's Almanach \"trying to fight your way out of a small town in the South\". To Peter Lindblad of Elmore Magazine \"Farmer\u2019s Almanac is a broken piece of scuffed luggage bulging with troubled narratives of angels, drifters, ghosts and oddballs trapped in a hole of small-town desperation\". Brother Dege and his band toured in America and in Europe during nine weeks (France and Netherland) and again in 2019. In 2022 after touring two months in Europe he toured again in America alone in acoustic concert for the first time since 2014.\nBrother Deg",

There was controversy as the Caledonians had said they would not protest so long as they could also field a guest player, who did not turn up.\nBefore the 1887\u201388 season, the club seems to have taken over Cannon F.C., which played at a ground by the Park Hotel in Tottenham; W. R. T. Wilson, the secretary of Cannon, was a regular for Old St Paul's, and Cannon's 1886\u201387 players, such as Leese, Keeves, and Huntingdon, are soon found playing for Old St Paul's.\nThe club's best run in the London Senior Cup was to the semi-final in 1888\u201389, where it lost 3\u20131 to the Royal Arsenal at Plumstead.  The following season, it entered the FA Cup qualifying rounds for the only time.  The club nearly reached the competition proper, winning through three rounds (including wins over Reading and Luton Town - the tie at Reading being particularly thrilling, the Old Saints going from 2\u20130 ahead to 3\u20132 behind in the 88th minute before equalizing in the 90th, and W. Ingram completing his hat-trick in the mutually-agreed extra-time to win the tie).\nAt the final qualifying stage, a weakened Saints side lost to its neighbour Clapton.  Regular goalkeeper Horace Keeves was unavailable, but was present as a spectator.  Two days later he died of congestion of the lungs.\nThe club's final competitive football came in the 1889\u201390 Middlesex Senior Cup, with a semi-final replay defeat to the London Caledonians.  At the start of the 1890\u201391 season, the club amalgamated with the City Ramblers club, taking the Ramblers' name.\nColours\nThe club wore light blue and black shirts.  After the merger with City Ramblers, the club took on the St Paul's school colours of white shirts.\nGround\nThe club originally played at Victoria Park, an area with several pitches from which to choose and on which several clubs played.  By 1887 it was playing at Chobham Farm in Leyton, using the Eagle pub for facilities, in addition to still using available pitches at Victoria Park.\n",
    "2000 film by John L'Ecuyer\nSaint Jude is a Canadian drama film, directed by John L'Ecuyer and released in 2000. The film stars Liane Balaban as Jude, a teenage girl from a dysfunctional family who hangs out on the streets of Montreal as a prostitute and drug addict.\nThe cast includes Nicholas Campbell as Jude's father, Victoria Sanchez as her sister Maureen, Kris Lemche as Maureen's HIV+ drug addict boyfriend Gabe and Bernie Coulson as Big Al, as well as Raymond Cloutier, Louise Portal, Victor Soumis, Simon Peacock, Tom Watt, Daniela Akerblom, Robert Morin, David DiSalvio, Arizona O'Neill, Mary Morter, Gerald L'Ecuyer, Griffith Brewer and Sasha Dominique in supporting roles.\nThe screenplay was written by Heather O'Neill and Esta Spalding, based in part on O'Neill's short story \"Big Al\". It was shot in Montreal in spring 1999.\nThe film premiered in the Perspective Canada program at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival.\nCritical response\nLiam Lacey of The Globe and Mail analyzed L'Ecuyer's choice to cast Balaban, in only her second film role following the wholesome coming-of-age drama New Waterford Girl just one year earlier, writing that \"there are a couple of needless fashion-shoot closeups of her mouth and eyes, but mostly, the choice of the glamorous-looking teenager is not just about casting pretty, but casting counterintuitively. Most actresses in Hollywood have donned the miniskirt and push-up bra to play street sexy. It's a more complex idea to suggest that someone who's good-looking and bright might find the street life temptingly easy.\"\nFor the Toronto Star, Geoff Pevere wrote that \"For all its considerable kinetic energy and dramatic charm - Balaban is appropriately charismatic, and both Coulson and Campbell leave deep impressions - Saint-Jude is a movie that never quite slips the bonds of its own conceptions. Which is to say that the script's poetic conceits never quite take occupancy of the streets they describe. \"You're like Vegas,\" Jude tells the dissolute junkie/angel/ impatient Gabriel (Lemche). \"You glow in the dark.\" He disagrees. \"Things that glow in the dark are very selfish,\" he says. \"They only make themselves look good.\" This is fine writing for the purposes of song or theatre, where verse does not fall on the ears with such clattering force. But it's pretty heavy stuff to keep aloft in the more naturalistic flow of a dramatic movie, and particularly a movie with its feet planted so firmly on the concrete.\"\n",

    "4th-century Christian monasteries in Egypt\nThe Pachomian monasteries or the Koinonia of Upper Egypt were a group of Christian cenobitic monasteries founded by Pachomius the Great during the 4th century A.D. Altogether, by the mid-300s A.D., nine Pachomian monasteries formed a network or federation of monasteries known as the Koinonia. All of the nine historical Pachomian monasteries are now defunct.\nHistory\nIn 329 A.D., Pachomius founded the Koinonia (originally a Greek word from the New Testament meaning 'fellowship'), or network of monasteries, when he established the new monastery of Pbow and moved there from Tabennisi.\nList of monasteries\nFrom north to south, the nine monasteries of the Koinonia were Tse, Tkah\u0161min, Tsmine, Tbew, Tmou\u0161ons, \u0160eneset, Pbow, Tabennesi, and Phnoum.:\u200a160\u200a Tse, Tkah\u0161min, and Tsmine, formed a cluster near Panopolis in the north, while Tbew, Tmou\u0161ons, \u0160eneset, Pbow, and Tabennesi made up the core nucleus of five monasteries near the modern-day town of Nag Hammadi. Phnoum was located much further to the south, near Latopolis. Pachomius also founded two nunneries in Tabennesi and Pbow.\nEach monastery was added to the Koinonia (monastic federation) in the following chronological order. Not all monasteries were newly founded or built by Pachomius when they were added to the koinonia; some were pre-existing monasteries.\nTabennesi\nPbow\n\u0160eneset (or Sheneset)\nTmou\u0161ons (or Thmoushons)\nTse\nTkah\u0161min\nTbew (or Thbew)\nTsmine\nPhnoum\nLeadership\nThe leadership hierarchy of the Koinonia was as follows.:\u200a126\u200a\nSuperior of the Koinonia, or \"father\" (apa or abba)\nSuperior of the individual monastery, or \"steward\" (oikonomos). The vice steward, or steward's assistant, is known as the \"second\" (deuteros).\n\"Housemaster\" (oikiakos) of an individual house (oikos) within each monastery. A housemaster also had had an assistant or \"second\" (deuteros). Each house had around a few dozen monks, while each monastery had a few dozen houses.\nPachomius was the first superior of the Koinonia. After Pachomius's death, Petronius became the superior of the Koinonia for three months until he also died, and was succeeded by Horsiesius. In 350, Horsiesius was succeeded by Theodorus when Horsiesius resigned. Horsiesius again became the superior of the Koinonia when Theodorus died in 368.:\u200a119\u200a A timeline of the superiors of the Koinonia is given below.\nPachomius (329\u20139 May 346)\nPetronius (9 May 346\u201321 July 346)\nHorsiesius (21 July 346\u2013350)\nTheodorus of Tabennese (350\u201327 April 368)\nHorsiesius (27 April 368\u2013387)\nDemographics\nAccording to John Cassian, there was a total of 5,000 monks in the Pachomian monasteries. Palladius gave a figure of 3,000 monks during Pachomius's time, and 7,000 monks by the end of the 4th century. Ammon gave a figure of 600 monks at Pbow when he resided there in 352 A.D.:\u200a123\u200a\nArchaeology\nArchaeological excavations of Pachomian monasteries have been conducted at Tabennesi, Pbow, and Sheneset-Chenoboskion.\nManuscripts\nVarious manuscripts have been discovered near the locations of Pachomian monasteries, leading scholars to propose that they were likely part of Pachomian monastic libraries. Tbew, Tmou\u0161ons, \u0160eneset, Pbow, and Tabennesi are all located within a day's walk of each other, and so the texts were likely to have been borrowed and exchanged among the different monasteries.:\u200a220\u200a\nNag Hammadi library\nDishna Papers\nBarcelona Papyrus\nThe Vision of Dorotheus\nSee also\nNag Hammadi library\nKellia\nCoptic monasticism\nChristian monasticism\nChristian monasticism before 451\nCenobitic monasticism\n",

    "Aboriginal Australian outlaw)\nJohnny Campbell (1846 \u2013 16 August 1880) was an Kabi bushranger active in South East Queensland. He was hanged in Brisbane Gaol in 1880.\nEarly life\nKagariu was born at Imbil on Yabber Creek (now known as Yabba Creek) in Baiyambora territory into the Dherwain section of the Dilbai moiety. His mother, Kami, was of the Bonda-gan section, and his father was a Barang of the Kopait-lhin moiety. It is thought that his father was killed during the Frontier Wars as part of a reprisal for spearing sheep. His mother went on to marry his paternal uncle, Bual, and later gave birth to a half-brother, Kilkaibriu.\nAs a young boy, Kagariu learned horsemanship before moving to Drayton, to work as a stockman. He returned to his clan a few years later, who were then residing on John Mortimer's Manumbar Station. During his time on Manumbar, he attended the Sabbath School run by Mrs. Mortimer. In 1865, he met John Mortimer's nephew, John Mathew, and rescued him from drowning in a waterhole. Mathew described him as being '5ft 3in in height' and weighing 40kg, with 'thick, long, wavy and tangled' hair and attired in 'a blue serge shirt gathered at the waist by a saddle strap.'\nWork as a stockman and first arrest\nAround 1865, Campbell was accused of molesting the daughter of a shepherd. He and an associate robbed the shepherd's hut and fled the station. In 1867, he returned to Manumbar to continue working as a stockman. By this time, the station workers believed he was innocent. Around this time, he married a woman of the Balkuin-gan section, known as Nelly, who gave birth to their son. In 1871, Campbell and Nelly became estranged after an incident in which he beat her and made her dive into a waterhole to retrieve his tomahawk. He then worked as a stockman for Edgar Foreman at Lake Dunethin. He got into a drunken fight one weekend and had his wounds tended by Foreman. Foreman then moved south to the Pine River, and Campbell returned to Manumbar.\nOn 4 June 1871, he was delivering rations to a shepherd's hut on Manumbar when the shepherd, Thomas O'Farrell, made arrangements for him to look over his sheep while he was away in Black Snake. During this time, Campbell was said to have assaulted the wife of the shepherd, Eliza O'Farrell. He then fled to Nanango, where he stole a horse and abducted an Aboriginal-Chinese girl from Gayundah. He went into hiding with Aboriginal people on Boonara Station, where he was betrayed to the station owners and held captive for a week. He was taken to Maryborough and, in October 1871, was sentenced to ten years penal servitude for assault and attempt to commit rape.\nBushranging\nIn 1879, Campbell was released from gaol on good behaviour. He stated to a settler that he intended to treat white women the same way white men treated native women. On 12 June, he held up and robbed two isolated farmhouses near Black Snake, and on 20 June, he robbed a further three houses at Mount Coora. On 25 June, it was reported that a woman had been attacked four miles from Tiaro. The police were sent in pursuit, and he led them on a chase around the Upper Mary. He stole a gun and ammunition from a hut near Gympie. On 23 July, he attacked a residence on Lochaber Station, near Gayndah, firing a gun at the house. In the morning, his stolen horse was found nearby, and he travelled to Dalgangal Station, where he stole another horse. The police tracked him from Bandon Station to Mount Perry. He was reportedly seen in the vicinity riding a black horse with his face whited and armed.\nOn 3 August, an Aboriginal woman attended the Kilkivan police barracks and reported that Campbell had visited her hut the previous night. Campbell attempted to convince an Aboriginal man named Wild Toby to procure grog for him. The man reported this to the head station, and a party of station workers rode out with breechloaders in an attempt to apprehend him. They attempted to sneak up on the hut, but Campbell was alerted to their presence when the dogs near the hut started barking. He ran towards the party and, on seeing them, crossed a creek and disappeared over a ridge. The party fired at him and gave chase, and during their pursuit encountered three mounted marsupial scalpers who had lost sight of him. In the evening of the same day, Campbell reportedly rode up to another hut near Cinnabar, belonging to an Aboriginal shepherd, and attempted to kidnap his daughter. When the shepherd's wife attempted to intervene, he assaulted her.\nOn 15 August, he was spotted outside a property near Gympie. He stole food and a watch and threatened to shoot a woman with a shotgun if she intervened. In September, he attempted to rob two houses near Kilcoy. He had two women in his company who he used as scouts, sending them to nearby farmhouses to request food and tobacco. On 27 September, he held up a woman at gunpoint at a house near the police paddock in Gympie until her husband scared him off. The police arrived two hours later to tra",
    "Military campaign of the Great Turkish War\nThe Moldavian campaign of the Polish\u2013Ottoman War of 1683\u20131699 was launched by the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth led by the Polish king, Jan III, in order to control Moldavia. The theatre of the war was split up into four separate phases: of 1684 and the two years following it, and again in 1691. All four efforts ended in failure for the commonwealth, and the last marked the end of the military career of Jan III.\nBackground\nAfter the victory at the Battle of Vienna, the Polish king, Jan III, decided to continue the war to oust the Ottomans from Europe. He made plans to conquer Moldavia and Wallachia, which would be under the control of his son, Jakub. In fall 1683, the Polish king appointed Stefan Kunicki as the leader of a campaign to oust the Ottomans from Moldavia. After initial success, the Polish-Cossack army was defeated by the Ottoman-Crimean army in the Battle of Reni. In April 1684, Jan made plans to launch another Moldavian campaign by conquering the Danube river mouth. He hoped to achieve two things: cut the supplies off Kamianets-Podilskyi, which was under Ottoman rule, force it to surrender, and isolate the Crimean Khanate from the Ottomans. The Polish king began mobilizing his army; he recruited an army of 17,000 to 20,000 Polish-Lithuanians and 50\u201360 cannons. Jan also made an agreement with Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg which the latter provided 2,000 Brandenburg troops. The Papacy significantly played a role in preparing the campaign. His generals, Stanis\u0142aw Jan Jab\u0142onowski, Andrzej Potocki, and Kazimierz Jan Sapieha, were appointed commanders-in-chief.\nCampaign\nFirst phase\nThe Polish army set out in August 1684; their first success was capturing Yazlovets on August 24. A strong Ottoman hold in Podolia slightly complicated the situation in Kamenets, but they did not give up. By the end of August, the Polish troops had captured the crossing of the Dniester river, ensuring the safety of the crossing into Moldavia. On September 1, the Polish army reached Zhvanets, where one of the crossings was located. On September 3, the king held a council where they would have disagreements regarding the campaign. The king favored the continuation of the campaign, while Stanis\u0142aw Jan Jab\u0142onowski was arguing for the siege of Kamenets. On September 4, the construction of a bridge to cross the Dniester had begun, which was complicated by the rain and strong winds, as well as battles with the Crimean troops. After a month, the almost-completed bridge was destroyed by a storm. Jab\u0142onowski spoke in favor of Kamenets siege. On October 1, The Polish army began leaving for Kamenets while simultaneously carrying out another bridge construction. The King dispatched a force to build another crossing near Gr\u00f3dek; however, the Polish army would face the Crimeans in bloody battles, which would slow down their march. Large Ottoman-Crimean forces approached the Dniester, and famine and disease began in the Polish army. The king was forced to abandon the campaign in Moldova and decided to retreat.\nSecond phase\nPope Innocent XI demanded the Polish king more vigorous action against the Ottoman front. In June 1685, Poland received money from the Papacy to launch another campaign. In July, Constantin Cantemir became the ruler of Moldavia. Constantin learned of Polish preparations for another campaign. He proposed to the Hetman, Stanis\u0142aw Jan Jab\u0142onowski, to focus on the siege of Kamenets instead of invading his country. The Polish king, facing serious difficulties during the siege, preferred to march against Moldavia, hoping not only to obtain territory but to cut off supplies from Kamenets. The Polish army consisted of 16,000 to 18,000 men; 12,000 Polish, 2,000\u20133,000 Lithuanians under Jozef Bogus\u0142aw S\u0142uszka, and 2,000\u20133,000 Cossacks under lieutenant Palij.\nOn August 1, 1685, the Polish army began moving towards the Dniester. On September 10, the Polish army began building a crossing. Five days earlier, the Polish received information of an Ottoman army of 15,000 led by Sulieman Pasha concentration at \u021au\u021bora who were delivering supplies to Kamenets. They decided to head there; they reached Sniatyn and there they crossed the border of Moldavian Bukovina. Then the army crossed the forests of Bukovina and headed towards the village of Boiany on September 29. At this time, the Ottomans decided to change their plan, and instead of heading towards Kamianets they turned towards the enemy reaching from the west.\nBoth armies met at Boiany on October 1, the Ottomans had 12,000 men while the Crimeans 30,000 alongside Moldavians. The Allied army attacked the Polish but despite the outnumbered, the Polish resisted. Constantine at the head of his troops fought alongside the Ottomans. The Following days the Polish turned into defensive, the Polish army found itself in difficult position, afraid of being surrounded and starved, they retreated on the night of October 9 and 10.

    "\nAgostino Antonio Giorgi (10 May 1711 \u2013 4 May 1797) was an Italian Augustinian monk and scholar who produced the first description of the Tibetan language in Europe, the Alphabetum Tibetanum. He worked in the Bibliotheca Angelica in Vatican with the support of Pope Benedict XIV and published several catalogues.\nLife and work\nCover of Alphabetum Tibetanum\nGiorgi was born Francesco Maria to Antonio (1685\u20131723) and Antonia Semprini (1687\u20131767) in San Mauro di Romagna. At the age of twelve he lost his father and he took to reading and joined the order of the Augustinian Hermits in 1726. He took the name Agostino Antonio the next year. He passed exams in Latin and took courses in philosophy and metaphysics. In 1730 he studied physics, mathematics, meteorology, and metaphysics at Verona under Agostino Gioia (1695\u20131752). In 1733 he studied theology under Gianlorenzo Berti (1696\u20131766) and at the same time studied Hebrew, Aramaic and Syriac. He was ordained by cardinal Prospero Lambertini (1675\u20131758) (later Pope Benedict XIV) in 1738. He served as a rector at convents in L'Aquila, Siena, Florence, and Padua before moving to Bologna. In 1740, the newly appointed Pope Benedict wanted him in Rome as the chair of sacred writings at the Archiginnasio della Sapienza. Giorgi was appointed to the post in 1746. He produced a number of catalogues of the books in the library and he donated his own collections of manuscripts. In 1759 he published Alphabetum Tibetanum which introduced the alphabet, grammar and syntax of the Tibetan language. He was assisted by Cassiano da Macerata (1708\u201391) who lived in Lhasa for a year and a half along with Orazio della Penna Billi (1680\u20131745) and Costantino da Loro (1704\u201370) as part of the Tibet mission of the Capuchins. The text was ostensibly intended for missionaries. Modern Tibetan scholars consider it a poor work but it represented the early Western fascination with Tibet and this work was forgotten after the works of Ippolito Desideri and others became available. In 1742, Giorgi was visited by Casanova who noted that the entire city knew him for his erudition.\nGiorgi attempted a history of Buddhism and gave wide publicity to the fable that Buddhism was related to the Classical God Mercury based on the word budha used for the planet Mercury.\n",

It is a part of the Krymskorozyvska Rural Council\u00a0. The village is situated in the western part of the district.\nDemographics\nAccording to a 2014 census, the village had a population of 249 people.\nNative languages\nThe following table displays the reported native languages of the 259 residents who responded to the 2001 Ukrainian census:\nGeography\nVyshneve spans 64 hectares and is part of the Krymskorozyvska Rural Council\u00a0.

As of 2017, the village has three streets: Amet-Khan-Sultan, Lesnaya, and Tsentralnaya (Russian: \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0442-\u0425\u0430\u043d-\u0421\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430, \u041b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0423\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430, \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0423\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430). Vyshneve is located in Bilohirsk Raion, on the eastern bank of the Zuya river, a tributary of the Salhyr. The village resides within the northern foothills of the Inner Ridge\u00a0 of the Crimean Mountains. The village is 292\u00a0m above sea level, and neighbours the villages of Zuya, Balanove\u00a0, and Krasnohirske\u00a0. The distance to the district centre is about 27\u00a0km. The nearest railway station is Simferopol railway station, about 26\u00a0km away.\nHistory\nThe village, originally known as the farmstead Novo-Alekseevka (Russian: \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e-\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u043a\u0430; Crimean Tatar: \u0646\u0648 \u0648 \u0622\u0644\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0641\u06a9\u0627), likely emerged in the early 1900s. According to the 1915 Statistical Handbook of the Taurida Governorate, Part II, Statistical Sketch, issue six, the village of Novo-Alekseevka in the Zuya Volost (a former administrative subdivision) of Simferopol Uyezd (another former administrative subdivision) had 7 households with a population of 29 people, including 14 men and 15 women. The residents owned 30 desyatinas (about 32.7 acres) of arable land and 212 desyatinas (about 231.08 acres) of non-arable land. Their farms had 18 horses, 5 cows, and 10 head of small livestock, although it was not marked on a later 1922 map.\nAfter the establishment of Soviet power in Crimea, the volost system was abolished by a decree of the Crimean Revolutionary Committee on 8 January 1921, and the village was included in the newly formed Pidgorodne-Petrivske Raion\u00a0 of Simferopol Uyezd. In 1922, uyezds were renamed to raions (Russian: \u0420\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u044b, lit.\u2009'districts'). On 11 October 1923, according to a decree by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTSIK), administrative changes were made in the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Crimean ASSR), resulting in the elimination of Pidgorodne-Petrivske Raion and the inclusion of the village in the Simferopol Raion.\nAccording to the List of Populated Areas of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic According to the All-Union Census of 17 December 1926, the Novo-Alekseevka farmstead in the Neizats Village Council\u00a0 of Simferopol Raion had 7 households, all peasant, with a population of 35 people.\nA new Zuya Raion\u00a0 was formed by a VTSIK decree on 10 June 1937, and the village was included in it. Novo-Alekseevka was still marked on the 1941 General Staff map of the Red Army. After the Crimean offensive in 1944, a decree dated 12 August 1944 initiated the resettlement of collective farmers to Crimean districts. In September 1944, the first new settlers (212 families) from the Rostov, Kyiv, and Tambov regions arrived in the district, followed by a second wave of settlers from various regions of Ukraine in the early 1950s.\nFrom 25 June 1946, the village was part of the Crimean Oblast of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), and on 26 April 1954, the Crimean Oblast was transferred from the RSFSR to the Ukrainian SSR. After the abolition of Zuya Raion on 24 September 1959, the village was re-included in Simferopol Raion. The exact date of its inclusion in the Zuya village council\u00a0 is unknown, but by 15 June 1960, the village was already part of it. A decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR, \"On the Enlargement of Rural Districts of the Crimean Oblast\" on 30 December 1962, abolished Simferopol Raion, and the village was joined to Bilohirsk Raion. By 1968, the village was part of the Zuya village council.\nAccording to the 1989 Soviet census, the village had a population of 120 people. Since 5 June 1990, Vyshneve has been part of the Krymskorozyvska Rural Council. From 12 February 1991, the village was part of the restored Crimean ASSR, renamed the Autonomous Republic of Crimea on 26 February 1992. Since 21 March 2014, Crimea, including the village, has been annexed by Russia.\nThe exact date when Novo-Alekseevka was renamed Vyshneve is not established, but it likely occurred in the 1930s, during the establishment of Krymska Roza.\n",
    "Ruined castle in Galicia, Spain\nThe Castle of Saint George was a medieval fortress located in the granite massif of Mount Pindo, in Carnota.\nHistory\nThe buildings stood for a good part of the Middle Ages, after being founded (or refounded) in the 10th century (at the time of the Western Towers) by the bishop Sisnando II, as part of his strategy of fortifying the Galician coast against the continuous Norman and Arab attacks and looting from the sea, also defending at this point an important path to Santiago de Compostela, a coveted economic and religious center of the time. That is why it is considered one of the oldest stone castles of Galicia, and of the few that could never have been conquered, that is known.\nThe fortification was located on Pico Pedrullo, a steep cliff 300 meters (980\u00a0ft) high located on the coast of Carnota near the site of Quilmas\u00a0, a spectacular natural geological formation with which they melted the walls of the fortress themselves, creating a complex that was very difficult to access. Consisting of several watchtowers and a tribute tower, it offered a fantastic perspective on the southern coast of the Costa da Morte allowing them to monitor the waters located between Cabo Touri\u00f1\u00e1n and Cabo Corrubedo.\nAfter passing alternately through the hands of the Crown, church and nobles of the time, and after featuring prominently in the Carnota Revolt\u00a0, little by little this fortress lost importance as the centers of power settled in the area around Santiago de Compostela from the thirteenth century, until finally at the beginning of the fourteenth century the noble Lope S\u00e1nchez de Ulloa, who at that time held the castle's title, asked the Church for permission to demolish the fortification:\nAnd you have knowledge that Lope Sanchez de Vlloa gave to Archbishop Don Rodrigo about dismantling the house of Saint George\nUnlike the neighboring Pe\u00f1afiel Castle, the castle must have already been destroyed at the time of the Irmandi\u00f1o revolts, which is confirmed by the absence of any reference to this fortification in medieval documentation that is preserved about this event.\nOver the centuries, the ruins of the castle became part of local legends and oral tradition, which placed among its rubble the treasures of the tomb of Queen Lupa. These legends caused that its remains were successively desecrated and removed in search of treasures and remains, causing that today the structures of the castle (which in the middle of the 20th century still stood several meters high) were reduced to an immense pile of rubble and the bases of some walls. Archaeological excavations have never been carried out on its remains.\nGallery\n10th century map of the castle of Saint George in Carnota\nSee also\nCastro\nCastros in Galicia\nIron Age Europe\nCastro culture\n",

The essay, titled \"The Ongoing Nakba: Towards a Legal Framework for Palestine,\" would have been the first piece by a Palestinian author published by the Harvard Law Review. After writing and submitting the essay in early November 2023, the Harvard Law Review met and voted to stop publication of the article. While no explanation was given, the Harvard Law Review posted a statement:\"Like every academic journal, the Harvard Law Review has rigorous editorial processes governing how it solicits, evaluates, and determines when and whether to publish a piece. An intrinsic feature of these internal processes is the confidentiality of our 104 editors\u2019 perspectives and deliberations.

They said:\n\"Days before the finalized piece was to be posted, at a time when the Law Review was facing a public intimidation and harassment campaign, the journal\u2019s leadership intervened to stop publication. The body of editors\u2014none of whom are Palestinian\u2014voted to sustain that decision.\nWe are unaware of any other solicited piece that has been revoked by the Law Review in this way.

    "2024 studio album by Thou\nUmbilical is the sixth studio album by American sludge metal band Thou. It was released on May 31, 2024, through Sacred Bones Records. Recording sessions took place in December 2023 at Hightower Recording in New Orleans.\nCritical reception\nUmbilical was met with positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 88, based on six reviews, which the website catgorized as \"universal acclaim\".\nHarry Sword of The Guardian praised the album, saying \"what results is the most maximalist and invigoratingly cathartic exercise in introspection you could possibly imagine \u2013 and one of the finest metal albums of the past decade\". Olly Thomas of Kerrang! resumed: \"this is simultaneously both the most pulverising and the most memorable release the band have put their name to in years\". Sputnikmusic staff Sunnyvale concluded: \"Umbilical unleashes a different side of the band's signature blend of bone-crunching riffs and ear-splitting screeching, but it's characteristically well-crafted and certain to satisfy music fans previously seduced by Thou's grim and imposing style\". Patrick Lyons of Pitchfork stated: \"Thou are a blast even when Funck is digging into esoteric philosophy over the slowest riff you've ever heard, but it's refreshing to hear them get real with themselves, jogging their music out of the enthralling but insular world they've created over the past 15-plus years\". John Amen of Beats Per Minute concluded, \"with Umbilical, Thou toe the doom-metal line re the inevitability of suffering/the urgent need for defiance while rummaging in an expanded playbook.

    "Student nation of Lund University\nWermlands Nation is one of thirteen student nations of Lund University in Sweden. It has 657 members and is thus the twelfth-largest student nation in Lund - ranking behind Hallands but ahead of Sm\u00e5lands Nation.\nHistory\nOne of the oldest nations in Lund, Wermlands was founded in 1682 with the intention of uniting students from the V\u00e4rmland region. It had four registered students at the time. Its first Inspektor,  Johannes Eric Ahlstr\u00f6m, was a professor of Roman poetry and rhetoric.\nIn 1947, Wermlands built their first nation house in its current place, on Stora Tv\u00e4rgatan 13. An extension wing was added to the house's west side by 1959. Around the same time, work started on a joint housing estate together with Kalmar Nation and Blekingska Nationen on M\u00e5sv\u00e4gen in western Lund. Wermlands' part of this estate has since been sold.\nIn 2021, Emily Boyd, head of the university's Centre for Sustainability Studies, was installed as the nation's Inspektrix. She succeeded Inspektor P\u00e4r Omling, who was installed in 2009.\nNotable members\nTage Erlander, who would later become Prime Minister of Sweden, served as a member of the nation's board and as Kurator (head executive) in 1922. He was a founding member of Kuratorskollegiet (KK) - the umbrella organization for Lund's student nations.\nAwards\nCited as a \"pioneer within sustainable student life\", the nation was awarded a stipend by the Sk\u00e5ne regional government in 2018 for its work towards environmental awareness within the organization.\nControversies\nEmbezzlement scandal\nIn late 2023, a former Prokurator Ekonomi (PQE), the nation equivalent of a treasurer, was convicted for gross breach of trust after embezzling 314,000 SEK (approx. \u20ac30,000) over a period of 14 months. After a successor had discovered unusual purchases as part of the nation's bookkeeping, authorities were alerted. The former treasurer, a 30-year-old woman, was arrested in April 2023 at Stockholm Arlanda Airport as she was about to leave the country. After a search of her apartment, expensive clothing items and accessories were found. She admitted to having done personal shopping using the nation's credit card with the intent of paying back the funds once able.\nAs part of the criminal investigation against the former treasurer, it was revealed that the nation had been paying her in the form of a stipend of 132,000 SEK over a period of 12 months. The payments - which had allegedly been approved by the nation's board and Proinspektor Martin C.E Asker - were not reported as salary payments with the Tax Agency, and as such the nation avoided paying over 200,000 SEK in taxes through this disallowed practice. A reason attributed to this form of payment was that the convicted treasurer was a foreign citizen without a work permit, which meant that she had not been allowed to receive a salary while residing in Sweden.\nBreach of alcohol serving regulations\nAs a consequence of \"financial misconduct\" - due in part to the convicted former treasurer's illicit compensation - Wermlands Nation received a formal warning by the municipal alcohol licensing authority in June 2024. Another reason given was that a person in charge of serving during an official inspection was not deemed suitable to be responsible, as the person could not identify what certain containers in the serving area contained, nor what their duties as serving-responsible entailed.\n",

    "\nThe Bombing of Calcutta was a series of aerial raids carried out by Imperial Japanese Army Air Force on Calcutta, the capital of the British Raj. The bombing caused significant damages to infrastructure and killed hundreds however it failed to achieve it's primary goal of significantly disrupting allied supply lines.\nBackground\nAfter the end of rainy season in 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force became much more active and raided north eastern Assam with the next target of Bombing Calcutta , with the objective of destroying the Calcutta port and  delaying the Allied preparations for a counter-offensive. The 7th Air Brigade had been given the responsibility and they had carried out rehearsals in Malaya in November. In late November 1942 the brigade was reinforced by some aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and, as reconnaissance showed a large concentration of shipping at Calcutta, the Japanese decided to raid the airfields in the Chittagong area at the end of the month to draw the Allied fighters away from Calcutta which was to be attacked on the 5th December but the attack was delayed till December 20.\nBombing\n1942\nOn December 20, 1942, aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force started bombing the city of Calcutta causing damage to infrastructure and multiple casualties.  The bombing campaign continued till 24 December. The airstrikes on Christmas Eve were mainly targeting the Europeans but failed to do significant damage and human casualties were not significant. The target Howrah Bridge wasn't damaged but other parts of the city faced damages.\nCalcutta had good air defence systems which forced the Japanese pilots to fly high to evade the air defence and they raised Calcutta only during the night. This bombing affected the industrial area and caused the displacement of 350,000 people. United States Army Air Force was also deployed in Calcutta and engaged with the Japanese.\n1943\nThe Royal Air Force bomber responded to these raids by destroying many Japanese aircraft and a Japanese aircraft carrier. By 1943, air defences were strengthened and RADAR guided night fighters were deployed which destroyed  several Japanese Mitsubishi Ki-21 and Mitsubishi Ki-46.\nIn January 1943, multiple Japanese raids were foiled by Royal Air Force.\nIn August 1943, Royal Air Force deployed Spitfires.\nOn 5 December 1943, a Japanese bombing on Calcutta's Kidderpore docks caused  hundreds of deaths and destruction of several ships and warehouses. Japanese aircraft dropped heavy explosives and anti-personnel bombs on the docks during day, without facing any resistance. The docks were devastated. Royal Air Force warplanes were deployed but they weren't able to engage.\n1944\nJapanese launched sporadic raids till 1944.\nAftermath\nIn 1944, due to allied advances on multiple fronts, the Japanese aircraft had to be relocated to other areas for providing support and thus the bombing raids over Calcutta stopped. In 1945, after the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the war came to an end.\n",
    "2024 Martial arts tournament film\nThe Last Kumite is a Kickstarter-funded 2024 low-budget martial arts film. It is directed by Ross W. Clarkson with a soundtrack by Paul Hertzog and Stan Bush, who composed for the classic martial arts tournament film Bloodsport. It is an homage to popular action movies of the last century.\nPlot\nMartial artist Michael Rivers wins an official martial arts competition, attracting the attention of Ron Hall, a promoter. Hall, also a human trafficker who does business mainly in Eastern Europe, invites Rivers to compete in an underground tournament in Bulgaria for a million dollar prize. Rivers, who has already decided to retire, declines the offer.\nHall needs to recruit challengers to face infamous underground champion Dracko, who is in the habit of crippling and killing his defeated opponents; he kidnaps Rivers' daughter Bree to force him to participate. On Rivers' arrival in Bulgaria, he meets Damon Spears and Lea Martin, other fighters who have been blackmailed out of retirement in a similar manner. They team up to save their family members during the tournament. Other martial artists Master Loren, whose wife was murdered and daughter kidnapped by Ron Hall, \"Lightning\", and Dracko's former Sensei Julie Jackson prepare Rivers for victory.\nProduction\nIn August 2023, Capelight Pictures released a 4K UHD DVD version of Bloodsport, which included a variety of features. As Bloodsport proved to be still popular, Capelight re-invested some money in a Kickstarter project titled The Last Kumite, \"inspired by the likes of Bloodsport, Kickboxer and No Retreat, No Surrender\".\nCast\nMathis Landwehr as Michael Rivers\nMatthias Hues as Ron Hall\nKurt McKinney as Damon Spears\nCynthia Rothrock as Julie Jackson\nBilly Blanks as Master Loren\nMichel Qissi as Wolf\nMonia Moula as Lea Martin\nKira Kortenbach as Bree Rivers\nMike Derudder aka \"Mike D.

YouTuber David Kurzhal (\"Viking Samurai\") also appears.\nSoundtrack\nPaul Hertzog composed the score, with added songs by Stan Bush. Hertzog described their renewed cooperation as \"a bit of a nostalgic nod to Bloodsport and Kickboxer\".\n",
    "\nThe assault on the presidential palace in Grozny \u00a0is a combat episode of the First Chechen war (1994\u20131996), which occurred during the assault on Grozny by Russian federal troops.\nBackground\nAfter the unrecognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria declared independence, the former building of the Republican Committee of the CPSU CHI ASSR in the city of Grozny began to be used as the residence of the leader of the Chechen separatists, President Dzhokhar Dudayev, as a result of which it became known as the \u201cpresidential palace\u201d . During this period, the building was also used for the work of the government of Ichkeria.\nOn December 26, 1994, at a meeting of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, a decision was made to storm Grozny. The plan to capture the city on the night of January 1 provided for the actions of groups of federal troops from four directions: \u201cNorth\u201d (under the command of Major General K. Pulikovsky ); \u201cWest\u201d (under the command of Major General V. Petruk); \"North-East\" (under the command of Lieutenant General L. Rokhlin ) and \"Vostok\" (under the command of Major General N. Staskov). The emphasis was on surprise and complete superiority in the quality of weapons. The groups were given a goal: to take administrative buildings, including the presidential palace and government building, radio, and railway station . From the northern direction, two assault detachments of the \u201cNorth\u201d group of troops and an assault detachment of the \u201cNorth-East\u201d group had the task, advancing in the zone allotted to them, to block the northern part of the city and the presidential palace from the north. From the western direction, two assault detachments of the \u201cWest\u201d group of troops, advancing in a designated zone, were supposed to capture the railway station, and subsequently, moving in a northerly direction, block the presidential palace from the south \u00a0.\nFor the defense of Grozny, the Chechen command created three defensive lines. The internal border, with a radius of 1 to 1.5\u00a0km, was located around the presidential palace. On the internal line, the defense of the Chechen formations was based on the creation of continuous resistance centers around the presidential palace using capital stone buildings. The lower and upper floors of the buildings were adapted for firing from small arms and anti-tank weapons. Along Ordzhonikidze, Pobeda and Pervomaiskaya streets, prepared positions were created for direct fire from artillery and tanks.\nNew Year's assault\nFederal troops \"West\" entered Grozny at 7:30\u00a0a.m., but during the operation the task of capturing the station was canceled and the forces were sent to the presidential palace. The main task of capturing the Presidential Palace of Dudayev (formerly the Republican Committee of the Chechen Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) went to the \u201cNorth\u201d group. The overall command of the North group was exercised by Major General Konstantin Pulikovsky ( 131st Motorized Rifle Brigade, 81st Motorized Rifle Regiment, 276th Motorized Rifle Regiment). Almost without a fight, the 1st Battalion of the 81st Motorized Rifle Regiment reached the railway station (by 13.00) and Dudayev's presidential palace (by 15.00). Until 12 noon, the Dudayevites did not offer resistance, as subsequent events showed - not by chance. Later it became known that Aslan Maskhadov, who was appointed in March 1994 as the Chief of the Main Staff of the Armed Forces of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, and who led the defense of the presidential palace in Grozny in December 1994 - January 1995, developed a plan according to which the Chechens deliberately let tanks into the city center, after which with the onset of darkness they struck. From buildings along the streets, infantry and armored vehicles were shot at point-blank range. Classic counteraction was organized to the movement of armored columns along the narrow streets of Grozny: usually the leading and trailing vehicles in the column were first destroyed, after which multi-tiered (floor-by-floor) fire was opened from the surrounding buildings on the rest of the armored vehicles. The battalions of the 81st Motorized Rifle Regiment and the 131st (Maikop) Motorized Rifle Brigade, standing in columns along the streets near the railway station and Dudayev's presidential palace, did not take care of organizing the defense and dispersing the units. Without covering the equipment, without setting up checkpoints along the route of movement and without conducting reconnaissance, they allowed the Chechens to secretly concentrate a strike force there, numbering up to 3.5 thousand militants, 50 guns and tanks, 300 grenade launchers, and suddenly attack with the onset of darkness. The battle began at about 19:00 and lasted all night on January 1. The soldiers and officers retreated to the station, where they tried to gain a foothold, but the building, which had huge windows and many entrances, was unsuitable for defense. Therefore, at night, at about 24 hours, the",
    "\nSecondary school in Makak, Cameroon\nThe Evangelical College of Libamba near Makak was established in 1945 during the expansion of the Presbyterian Church in the Bassa region of Cameroon.\nHistory\nInitially named the Institute of Evangelical Missions of Libamba, it later became the Evangelical College of Libamba. The college was created to meet the need, after World War I, to educate Cameroonians up to the baccalaureate level. An elite group of American professors, such as David Gelzer, and European professors were assigned to the school.\nThe college is located midway along the railway line between the stations of Makak (10\u00a0km) and Minka (2\u00a0km).\nConstruction of the institution\nThe construction of the institution and its boarding school was funded by a grant of 15 million CFA francs from the French colonial administration. The land was provided by the local populations to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des missions \u00e9vang\u00e9liques de Paris, which, along with the Presbyterian Church, divided the space equally for the construction of the church and the college and its boarding school.\nFirst Cameroonian Elite\nThe inter-missionary college with a full cycle has long been one of the top secondary schools in Cameroon. The first batch of graduates in Cameroon came from this college, although some completed their education at Lyc\u00e9e Leclerc in Yaound\u00e9. The play Trois pr\u00e9tendants...un mari, a classic of Cameroonian literature, was written by Guillaume Oy\u00f4n\u00f4 Mbia while he was at the Evangelical College of Libamba.\nNotable alumni and associated personalities\nAndr\u00e9 Ngongang Ouandji, minister, obtained his BEPC in 1955\nGuillaume Oy\u00f4n\u00f4 Mbia, writer, author of Trois pr\u00e9tendants...un mari which he wrote at the Evangelical College of Libamba\nList of directors and enrollment\nNotes and references\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Coll\u00e8ge \u00e9vang\u00e9lique de Libamba.\n^ Ekollo, Thomas (2003).

They would briefly reunite in 2009 for a tour, but would soon dissolve again. It wouldn't be till September 2017 that the band would re-unite permanently. While the rest of the band wanted too, lead vocalist David Yow was not committed to making another record, but upon hearing the demos the rest of the band sent to him, he was impressed and began to workshop vocals in 2019.\nThe album was announced on June 5, 2024, along with the release of the lead single and music video for \"Hide and Seek\" and tour dates spanning from June 2025 to May 2025. Yow would describe \"Hide and Seek\" as a \u201ca perky ditty about a witch who can\u2019t behave, and it\u2019s got nearly as many hooks as a Mike Tyson fight.\u201d\nRecording\nIn an interview the band did for The New York Times, the band began working on the record in 2019 at Audio Eagle in Nashville, Tennessee with local producer and session guitarist Paul Allen. According to bassist David Wm. Sims, they chose to write a new record because \"we thought it would be fun\".\nThe only track on the record to have its origins in the nineties is \"Lord Godiva\", with everything else written within the past five years.\nIn a statement by guitarist Duane Denison on the musical direction of the record, \u201cthere are definitely some references to the past, but it\u2019s more as a point of departure: We don\u2019t stay there,\u201d Drummer Mac McNeilly also noted in a statement that \"we are bonded by the music we make, and also by the respect we have for each other.\", when talking about the making of the record.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nThe Jesus Lizard\nDavid Yow \u2013 vocals\nDuane Denison \u2013 guitar\nDavid Wm.

Clarke worked as a dentist as a profession, and collected specimens as a hobby. Most of Clarke's specimens were collected between the 1910s and 1940s, and Clarke published findings in the Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand between 1920 and 1934.\nIn 1915, a moth specimen collected by Clarke from Flagstaff Hill, Dunedin was used by George Howes to describe the moth species Hydriomena clarkei, which Howes named after Clarke.\nClarke discovered and identified numerous moth species between 1920 and 1936, including Ericodesma cuneata, Heterocrossa sanctimonea and Asterivora urbana. Clarke's specimens were also used by New Zealand entomologists to describe new species, including Edward Meyrick in 1924 describing Atomotricha prospiciens, George Hudson to describe Asaphodes glaciata in 1925, and by entomologist Alfred Philpott, who described Proteodes clarkei in 1926, naming the species after Clarke.\nIn 1929, Clarke donated much of his insect collection to Auckland War Memorial Museum. Using Clarke's collections, Philpott described numerous moth species, including Archyala culta, Orocrambus clarkei, Paramorpha marginata and Zapyrastra stellata.\nClarke died on 17 September 1952. After his death, Clarke's collection of beetles was acquired by Auckland War Memorial Museum and the British Museum.\nOver 5,500 specimens by Clarke are found in the collections of Auckland War Memorial Museum.

    "Somali clan\nEthnic group\nAbokor Musa (Somali: Abokor Muuse, Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648\u0628\u0643\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649) is a Somali clan, and part of the Muse Daoud, which  belongs to the Eidagale clan.\nOverview\nThe Abokor Musa is a Somali clan that belongs to the Eidagale clan of the Isaaq clan family. Members of the Abokor Musa subclan are descendants of Ismail Sh-Ishaaq.They inhabit the Hargiesa and Salahley regions of Somaliland, in addition to the Somali Region and Kenya. Historically, the Abokor Musa traditionally consists of nomadic pastoralists, merchants, and skilled poets.\nEtymology\nThe Eidagale clan traces its lineage back to Ismail Sh-Ishaq. Formerly, the Abokor Musa were chiefly nomadic pastoralists, merchants, and skilled poets. Members of the subclan of the Abokor Musa are descendants of the Sh-Ishaq.\nThe name Abokor originates from the root word \"Awar\", which means \"a large male  camel.\". The name is derived from a historical event involving Musa daoud, where camel breeding was a tradition passed down from their father, Daoud.\nThe progenitor of the Abokor Muse clan had two sons but is divided into five major sub-clans, which belong to the Abokor Musa family. The clan undertakes the traditional rural lifestyle of the nomadic Somali culture of herding camels and other livestock.However, they have settlements in towns in Somaliland, such as Salahley, and also in the southern districts of the Maroodi Jeex region.\nHistorically, the Abokor Musa made an influential Somali caravan trade in long-distance, procuring merchants different items from the Somali Region, such as livestock and other goods, into the markets of Hargiesa City, then the coastal city of Berbera, which were then subsequently exported to Southern Arabia.\nHistory\nMedieval period\nHistorically, the Eidagalle participated in the conquest of Abyssinia, were part of the Adal Sultanate, and are mentioned in the book Futuh Al-Habash (Conquest of Abyssinia) as Habar Magaadle. The Habar Magaadle are known for producing a historical figure known as Ahmed Gurey bin Hussein who was the right-hand man of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi.\nI. M. Lewis discusses the existence of another leader named Ahmed Gurey, and suggests that the two leaders have been conflated into one historical figure:\nThe text refers to two Ahmed's with the nickname 'Left-handed'. One is regularly presented as 'Ahmed Guray, the Somali' identified as Ahmad Gurey Hussein, chief of the Habar Magaadle. Another reference, however, appears to link the Habar Magadle with the Eidagalle clan. Another Ahmed is simply referred to as 'Imam Ahmad' or simply the 'Imam'.This Ahmad is not qualified by the adjective Somali.The two Ahmad's have been conflated into one figure, the heroic Ahmed Guray.\nFor centuries, the tomb of saint Aw Barkhadle, which is located between Berbera and Hargeisa, was used by the Isaaq clans to settle disputes and to swear oaths of alliances under a holy relic attributed to Bilal Ibn Rabah. As traditional leaders of the Isaaq clans, the Eidagale placed themselves as mediators during the disputes.\nWhen any grave question arises affecting the interests of the Isaakh tribe in general. On a paper yet carefully preserved in the tomb, and bearing the sign-manual of Belat , the slave of one of the early khaleefehs, fresh oaths of lasting friendship and lasting alliances are made...In the season of 1846 this relic was brought to Berbera in charge of the Haber Gerhajis, and on it the rival tribes of Aial Ahmed and Aial Yunus swore to bury all animosity and live as brethren.\nFor centuries, the Eidagale were influential stakeholders in the long-distance Somali caravan trade. Eidagalle merchants procured various goods from the Somali Region in present-day Ethiopia, such as livestock, acacia gum, myrrh, and ghee, which were subsequently exported to Southern Arabia. The Ciidagalle caravan merchants founded several inland trade entrep\u00f4ts in the interior, which also includes the modern city of Hargeisa, founded in the 19th century as a caravan junction between Berbera and the Somali interior.\nSomalis of the Habar Gerhajis tribe arrive from Ogadain with feathers, myrrh, gum, sheep, cattle, and ghee, carrying away in exchange piece goods; they also make four trips in the season; they remain for less than a month, and during their stay reside with fellow-tribesmen, taking their meals in the mokhb\u00e2zah or eating-house.\nClan tree\nA summarised clan family tree  of the Abokor Musa, is presented below:\nDaoud (Eidagale)\nMuuse Daoud\nAbokor Muuse\nHassan Abokor\nMuse Hassan\nLaqshe Hassan\nBasirale Hassan\nDhimbil Hassan\nMohammed Dhimbil\nMusa Mohammed\nAdawe Muse (Rer Cadawe)\nAllemagan Adawe\nAbsiye Adawe\nAden Muse (Rer Aden Muse)\nHad Aden\nGeedi Aden\nBoqorre Aden\nMuawiye Mohammed\nFatah Mohammed (Rer Fatah)\nGuled Mohammed (Rer Guled)\nMuuse Dhimbil\nAbdalle Muuse\nJibriil Abdalle Muse\nKaliil Jibriil (Baho Jibriil)\nAden Jibriil  (Baho Jibriil)\nAbdi Jibriil\nAli Abdi (Rer Ali-Abdi) (Ba Younis)\nNour Abdi (Rer Nour) (Ba Younis)\nBiniin Abdi (Rer Biniin",
    "2007 case of a National Serviceman going AWOL in Singapore\nOn 2 September 2007, 20-year-old Corporal Dave Teo Ming (\u5f20\u94ed Zh\u0101ng M\u00edng), a full-time National Serviceman from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), went absent without official leave (AWOL) from Mandai Hill Camp and deserted his unit with a SAR-21 assault rifle and eight live 5.56mm rounds. Teo was arrested at a shopping mall in Orchard Road after a 20-hour manhunt and he was charged with possessing a rifle and live rounds of ammunition under the Arms Offences Act. It was alleged that Teo escaped camp and intended to use the rifle to murder his ex-girlfriend and several other people he hated in his life. In July 2008, Teo was put on trial, convicted and sentenced to nine years and two months' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. During February of that same year, Teo's accomplice Ong Boon Jun (\u738b\u6587\u4fca W\u00e1ng W\u00e9nj\u00f9n) was also given a sentence of 78 months' jail with six strokes of the cane for consorting with Teo who illegally possessed a firearm.\nAWOL incident and manhunt\nOn 2 September 2007, 20-year-old Corporal Dave Teo Ming of the 1st Singapore Infantry Regiment of the Singapore Armed Forces went missing from Mandai Hill Camp. His disappearance was only noticed at 11.59 pm, and it was also discovered by the army personnel that Teo's rifle and five bullets, which were issued to him for guard duty, were also missing. As a result, the military police were alerted to Teo's desertion and they conducted a search within the camp premises. After the search failed to locate Teo, the Singapore Police Force took over the case and thus initiated an island-wide manhunt, and over 200 police officers participated in the manhunt to capture Teo, although this operation was conducted in secrecy and away from the public eye.\nAbout 20 hours later, at about 8pm on 3 September 2007, Teo was finally arrested at a shopping mall near Orchard Road; the police discovered him at a toilet in the mall's third floor, just when Teo managed to load the rifle. The police managed to recover the rifle and five bullets; they also recovered three more live rounds of ammunition which Teo stole from the camp back in August 2007 during a live-firing exercise. A 40-cm long knife was also recovered in Teo's possession. Based on first-hand investigations, the police managed to uncover that while on the run, Teo and a friend had stayed at a Geylang hotel and asked for a Thai prostitute. The same friend was also arrested on suspicion of having accompanied and abetted Teo during his desertion. The police announced to the public regarding the incident, and they admitted that this manhunt was not publicized out of consideration for the operation to be carried out safely and successfully, and for fear that it may only provoke the suspect into resorting to worse measures. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) also stated in a media statement that MINDEF and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) would cooperate with the police in investigating the case.\nIn response to the arrest of Dave Teo, his 70-year-old grandmother Tan Ah Hoon, who was his primary caregiver after his parents' divorce, was in a state of anguish over her grandson's actions, especially since she already lost one of her grandsons (Teo's younger brother) to a car accident in 2001. Tan died from liver cancer in late 2007 while Teo was still in remand awaiting trial for the AWOL incident he perpetuated. The public was also shocked at the desertion, and it was also speculated that Teo had went AWOL due to a failed relationship, although a source revealed that Teo, who was originally supposed to end his National Service (NS) in October 2007, had performed well in his NS duties. Teo's army partner and superior also noted that Teo did not show any unusual behaviour during his time at the army camp, although the superior recalled that Teo was stressed about issues related to his ex-girlfriend.\nThe AWOL case of Dave Teo was the first time in 23 years where a National Serviceman had gone AWOL with a rifle and ammunition. The last such case happened on 6 August 1984, when 18-year-old Teo Yong Kuan, who came from the 30th Singapore Combat Engineering Battalion, was charged with stealing an AR-15 rifle and 30 bullets from Khatib Camp. Teo Yong Kuan, who admitted to all charges, was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 12 May 1986.\nCriminal charges of Ong and Teo\nOn 5 September 2007, 20-year-old Dave Teo Ming was officially charged in the Subordinate Courts with an unlawful possession of a firearm under the Arms Offences Act. His 21-year-old accomplice Ong Boon Jun was also charged in the same court, and he faced one count of consorting with Teo while being aware that Teo possessed a firearm. Teo, who did not wish to plead guilty, faced a sentence of between five and 14 years' jail with the mandatory minimum of six strokes of the cane for the charge he faced in court. A week later, Teo faced two additional charges on top of the firearms ",
    "American attorney\nJames Roberts Troupis (born September 30, 1953) is an American lawyer and Republican political operative from Dane\u00a0County, Wisconsin.  He was an attorney for Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, and was involved in the efforts to overturn the election results.  He was also involved in the plot to produce fraudulent electoral votes to challenge the legitimate electoral votes at the January\u00a06 certification.  He has been charged with conspiracy to utter as legitimate a forged document.\nHe was also a member of Wisconsin's Judicial Conduct Advisory Committee from 2021 until 2024, when he was suspended due to his indictment.  Earlier, he served one year as a Wisconsin circuit court judge in Dane\u00a0County (2015\u20132016) and was mayor of Mendota, Illinois (1985\u20131987).\nEarly life and career\nJames Troupis was born in 1953 and raised in Mendota, Illinois.  During Jim's childhood, his father was mayor of the city.  He earned his bachelor's degree from the Northwestern University, then immediately continued his education at the Northwestern University School of Law, earning his J.D. in 1978.  While attending law school, he was editor-in-chief of the Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology and clerked for Howard C. Ryan, then a justice of the Illinois Supreme Court.  From 1979 to 1987, he practiced law in Mendota in partnership with his father, in a law firm known as Troupis & Troupis.\nHe became involved in Republican politics during these years.  He was elected mayor of Mendota in 1985, and was director of state representative Judy Koehler's campaign for United States Senate in 1986.  Koehler lost badly in the general election.  The following year, Troupis moved to Dane County, Wisconsin, where he became a partner in the law firm Michael\u00a0Best &\u00a0Friedrich\u00a0LLP.  He remained at that firm until 2010, handling significant corporate litigation.  After 2010, he practiced in his own law firm, the Troupis Law Office.\nRepublican Party legal advocacy\nShortly after moving to Wisconsin, Troupis became a prominent lawyer for the Republican Party of Wisconsin.  He was one of the lead attorneys for the Republican Party in 1992 litigation over redistricting, culminating in the federal court case Prosser v. Wisconsin State Elections Board, 793 F. Supp. 859 (1992).  The named plaintiff in that case was Troupis' client, David Prosser Jr., then the Republican minority leader in the Wisconsin State Assembly.\nIn 2001, Troupis applied for appointment to a newly created federal judgeship in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.  That appointment ultimately went to William C. Griesbach.  Troupis again represented Republican legislators in litigation for the 2000 redistricting cycle.  In this cycle, he petitioned for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take jurisdiction over the redistricting case, hoping this time to avoid a map drawn by the federal court.  In the case of Jensen v. Wisconsin State Elections Board, 249 Wis. 2d 706 (2002), the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined the case in a per curiam opinion. The maps were eventually redrawn by a federal court panel, in the case Baumgart v. Wendelberger.\nThrough the following decade, Troupis was involved in more litigation on behalf of the state Republican Party.  He represented state senator Joe Leibham in a recount of his senate election in 2002.  Leibham sought federal intervention to set uniform counting standards, and prevailed by 46 votes.\nIn 2007, Troupis represented recently elected conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court justice Annette Ziegler after she was accused of violating the state code of judicial ethics.  In her ten years as a circuit judge, Ziegler had ruled on more than 30 cases in which she or her husband had a direct financial interest.  Ziegler settled the case with the state Ethics Board for $17,000, and Troupis then represented her at a hearing before three state Court of Appeals judges assigned to adjudicate the ethics complaint.  Troupis reassured the judges that she would not make that mistake again.  The panel ultimately recommended a reprimand; the Wisconsin Supreme Court then voted to reprimand her in a 5\u20131 decision.\nIn 2008, Troupis represented the state Republican Party as an intervenor in the state Attorney General's lawsuit to force the state elections board to implement more strict voter identification rules before the 2008 United States presidential election.  The lawsuit was dismissed in October 2008.\nThe next year, he represented former state Veterans Affairs Secretary John Scocos in a lawsuit against the state Veterans Affairs Board over his firing.  Discovery in the lawsuit revealed that the board had agreed to fire him a week before taking action and had coordinated their communications with the governor's office, technically a violation of the state open meetings laws.\nIn 2011, Troupis represented David Prosser again.  The former Assembly speaker was, by then, a justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  After a na",
    "Dutch priest and politician (1936 \u2013 2013)\nHerman Alphons Verbeek (17 May 1936 \u2013 1 February 2013) was a Dutch priest and politician.\nBiography\nVerbeek studied theology and became a Catholic priest in 1963. From 6 September 1963 to 28 August 1965, he was a chaplain in Joure. Between 1968 and 1973, he was an advisor to the diocese of Groningen. He was a priest of the diocese of Groningen, but since becoming politically active in 1969, he no longer held any ecclesiastical office. In 1999, he openly clashed with the newly appointed bishop of Groningen, Wim Eijk, over his views on sexuality, publicly coming out as a homosexual priest.\nFrom 1974 to 1977, he was the chairman of the provincial board of the Political Party of Radicals in Groningen. From 1977 to 1981, he was the national party chairman. In 1984, he was elected to the European Parliament for the Green Progressive Accord, a coalition of the PPR, the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN), and the Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP). It was agreed that the PPR candidate would step down halfway through the term in favor of the CPN candidate, Nel van Dijk. Verbeek left the European Parliament in 1986.\nIn 1989, Verbeek became the lead candidate for the Rainbow, a coalition of PPR, CPN, PSP, and the EVP, for the 1989 European Parliament election. Again, it was agreed that the PPR candidate would step down halfway through the term, this time in favor of the PSP candidate, John Hontelez. In 1991, Verbeek refused to do so, believing he still had work to do for organic farmers. The party board of GroenLinks (which included PSP, PPR, and CPN) wanted to expel him, but the party council refused to approve the expulsion. Verbeek remained a member of the European Parliament but operated independently of his party. In 1994, he left GroenLinks and became the lead candidate for The Greens in the 1994 European elections, but the party did not meet the electoral threshold.\nVerbeek authored many spiritual and political books, such as Tegen de tijdgeest and Liedboek Voor De Ziel.\nHe passed away on 1 February 2013. A posthumous autobiography was published.\nThe ecumenical songbook Zangen van Zoeken en Zien (2015) is dedicated to Herman Verbeek.\nIn 2018, Dat gij het zingt, a collection of Verbeek's posthumous songs and reflections, was published, edited by Chris van Bruggen and Micha\u00ebl Steehouder.\nPublications (selection)\nHerman Verbeek: Liedboek voor de ziel.

    "Jersey cricketer (born 2005)\nCharlie Brennan (born 23 September 2005) is a cricketer who plays for Jersey.\nCricket career\nHaving been involved with Jersey's cricket performance programme since the age of 10, Brennan was still only 16 when he got his first call-up to the island's senior squad for the ICC T20I World Cup Europe qualifier tournament in October 2021 at Desert Springs Cricket Ground, Almer\u00eda, Spain. He went on to make his full international debut in the event against Germany on 19 October.\nBrennan was named Jersey Cricket Young Player of the Year in 2022 after a season which saw him further establish himself in the senior national squad as well as captaining Jersey to victory over Guernsey in the under-18s version of the inter-insular Muratti competition.\nHe scored his first international half-century on 7 July 2023, when he hit 67 not out in the opening contest of the home three-match T20I inter-insular series against neighbours Guernsey, earning himself player of the match honours in the process.\nLater that month he was part of the Jersey squad for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier event in Edinburgh, Scotland. The highlight of the tournament for Breenan was scoring 43 in a 28-run win over Denmark as Jersey finished fourth.\nSwitching to the 50-over format in August 2023, Brennan was selected among the Jersey contingent to compete in the Netherlands at the European play-offs for 2024 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup qualification where they finished third in the six-team competition.\nIn September 2023, he was a member of the Jersey team which won their group to reach finals week at the T10 2023 European Cricket Championship in M\u00e1laga, Spain. Brennan scored 59 off 26 balls as Jersey defeated Guernsey in the qualifying round to advance straight through to the group final where they beat Belgium.\nReturning to M\u00e1laga in March 2024, Brennan helped his club side, Old Victorians, make it into championship week at the fourth edition of the T10 European Cricket League. He scored 20 off 12 balls in a 76-run opening partnership with international teammate Jonty Jenner as the Jersey team defeated Swiss outfit Olten in the group C final.\nFootball career\nBrennan has captained the Jersey under-18s football team including leading them to victory in the age-group Muratti final against Guernsey in March 2024. He has also played for the island's under-21s.\n",
    "Japanese racing team\nK-tunes Racing is a racing team based in Kurashiki, Okayama Prefecture, Japan, run by Okayama Toyopet.\nHistory\nToyota car dealership Okayama Toyopet founded K-tunes Racing in 2013. The team was named after the Kurashiki GR Garage, taking the \"K\" with the word \"tunes\" to indicate car tuning.\nIn 2018, the team competed in the GT300 class of Super GT with a Lexus RC F GT3. The car number was 96, the drivers were Morio Nitta and Toyota factory driver Yuichi Nakayama, and they used Bridgestone tires. They had a collaboration with LM Corsa to operate the team, competing in a joint system with three teams, with Inging Motorsport in charge of vehicle maintenance. They won two races, and Nitta gained the record for the most wins in a row, which had been previously held by Shinichi Takagi. For 2019, they recruited Sena Sakaguchi as Nitta's co-driver, and changed the team management to a system where the team is operated solely by the company, while Inging continued to be in charge of vehicle maintenance. They won the opening race in Okayama and the third race in Suzuka, and finished the season in second place in the driver/team rankings, their best result since the team's founding.\nIn 2020, the team changed its tire manufacturer to Dunlop and became independent by carrying out in-house vehicle maintenance. After a strong performance the previous year, the team finished the season winless with only two points finishes. In 2021, Sakaguchi competed in the GT500 class as a replacement for Sacha Fenestraz for a couple of rounds, with Hibiki Taira replacing Sakaguchi for those rounds. Shinichi Takagi replaced Sakaguchi, who was promoted to the GT500 class. Nitta and Takagi were reunited for the first time in 12 years, having been teammates at ARTA until 2010.\nK-tunes Racing also made their debut in GT World Challenge Asia in 2022, with Nitta and Masanori Nogami in the Lexus RC F GT3 for the fifth round. They returned for the Japan Cup in 2023 with Kazunori Suenaga replacing Nogami. They also entered a GT4 Toyota Supra with Hiromitsu Fujii and Masanori Nogami. In 2024, the team expanded their entry with an additional car, the Ferrari 296 GT3 driven by Takagi and Daisuke Yamawaki.\n",
    "15th race of the 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series\nMotor car race\nThe 2024 Hy-Vee PERKS 250 was the 15th stock car race of the 2024 NASCAR Xfinity Series, and the 10th iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, June 15, 2024, at Iowa Speedway in Newton, Iowa, a 0.875 miles (1.408\u00a0km) permanent asphalt tri-oval shaped racetrack. The race was originally scheduled to be contested over 250 laps, but was extended to 253 laps due to a NASCAR overtime finish. In an action-packed race, Sam Mayer, driving for JR Motorsports, would take the lead from Riley Herbst in the late stages, and held off the field on an overtime restart to earn his sixth career NASCAR Xfinity Series win, and his second of the season. Chandler Smith had dominated the majority of the race, leading a race-high 131 laps before fading back in the final stage to finish 8th. To fill out the podium, Herbst, driving for Stewart\u2013Haas Racing, and Corey Heim, driving for Sam Hunt Racing, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively. \nThis was the first race for the series at Iowa since 2019, after the 2020 race was canceled due to the pandemic and the race was removed from the 2021 schedule.\nReport\nBackground\nFlagstand of Iowa Speedway in June 2007, the track where the race was held.\nIowa Speedway is a 7/8-mile (1.4\u00a0km) paved oval motor racing track in Newton, Iowa, United States, approximately 30 miles (48\u00a0km) east of Des Moines. The track was designed with influence from Rusty Wallace and patterned after Richmond Raceway, a short track where Wallace was very successful. It has over 25,000 permanent seats as well as a unique multi-tiered Recreational Vehicle viewing area along the backstretch.\nEntry list\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\nPractice\nThe first and only practice session was held on Friday, June 14, at 3:35 PM CST, and would last for 50 minutes.

    "Irish-American merchant\nFor other people named William Redmond, see William Redmond.\nWilliam Redmond (October 22, 1804 \u2013 September 13, 1874) was an Irish-born American merchant.\nEarly life\nRedmond was born in Ballymena, County Antrim in Northern Ireland on October 22, 1804. He was a son of cattle dealer Samuel Redmond (1780\u20131825) and Anne (n\u00e9e Ramage) Redmond (1780\u20131847), who was related to the Moores of Moore Lodge, Ballymoney, and the McNeales of Ballycastle, both in County Antrim.\nCareer\nAt the age of 17, Redmond moved from his native Northern Ireland to Charleston, South Carolina before settling in New York City. He was the founder of Wm. Redmond & Sons.  He was one of the founders of the Union Club.\nIn New York, the Redmonds lived at 6 North Washington Square. After spending two summers in Orange, he purchased the Squire farm in South Orange, New Jersey in 1850, including the Squire homestead built in 1774. There he built a large brownstone mansion called Hillside, which, today, is the clubhouse of the Orange Lawn Tennis Club.\nPersonal life\nRedmond married Sabina Elizabeth Hoyt (1812\u20131870), a daughter of Sabina (n\u00e9e Sheaff) Hoyt and Goold Hoyt Jr., native of Norwalk, Connecticut who was a merchant with Hoyt & Tom and was involved with the East India and China trade and one of the founders of the Merchants' Exchange National Bank. The niece of Jesse Hoyt, a Collector of the Port of New York who was known for his role in the Swartwout-Hoyt scandal, she was also sister to Lydig Monson Hoyt (who married Blanche Geraldine Livingston (a daughter of Maturin Livingston) and Henry Sheaffe Hoyt (who married Frances Duer, a daughter of Judge William Alexander Duer), and Goold Hoyt III (who married Adeline Camilla Scott, a daughter of Gen. Winfield Scott). Together, they were the parents of ten children, including:\nWilliam Redmond Jr. (1835\u20131898), who married Mary Lawrence Griffin, a daughter of Lt. William Preston Griffin.\nSabina Redmond (1836\u20131905), who married Glasgow native, John Walter Wood, who went into business with his brother-in-law under the name Wood & Redmond (later J.

    "\nAbell 2219 BCG (short for Abell 2219 Brightest Cluster Galaxy), also known as PGC 2285869, is a massive type-cD elliptical galaxy residing as the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the Abell 2219 galaxy cluster located in constellation Hercules. At the redshift of 0.224, the galaxy is around 2.7 billion light-years from Earth.\nProperties\nAbell 2219 BCG is one of the largest galaxies. Radio loud and estimated to be 713,400 light-years across in diameter, the galaxy is the most luminous object found. Distinctive from other galaxies located in the same cluster, Abell 2219 BCG is considered to have a narrow distribution of luminosity with a luminosity evolution of estimated dM/dt = 1.09 (1 + z) H0 mag yr -1, based from the Friedmann universe model. This high luminosity indicates, the galaxy was brighter during the past. It also contains an X-ray source at high-galactic latitude.\nMoreover, Abell 2219 BCG is aligned together with its parent cluster with a large galactic halo, making it the most massive observed at slightly later cosmic epoch. It contains an extended intracluster light profile, with surface brightness of the ranging between 27.5 mag arcsec-2 at 100 kpc and ~32 mag arcsec-2 at 700 kpc, observed by r-bands. Light profiles tend to reach up to several hundreds of kiloparsecs.\nOne such possible theory for special properties of BCGs like Abell 2219 BCG, is the galactic cannibalism. As the BCG in Abell 2219, the galaxy tends to merge and engulf its neighboring and satellite galaxies through the process of dynamic friction, becoming more luminous in appearance. As it is a mass-dependent process, these galaxies merge quickly with their central galaxy. From major mergers, comes the building-up of mass in the central galaxy as well as reducing the number of massive satellite galaxies. According to  Lauer who looked for evidence of interactions between the BCG and secondary galaxies, the cannibalism rate is estimated to be \u223c2L* per 5 \u00d7 109 yr.\nThe recent star formation in Abell 2219 BCG that contains a blue rest-frame ultraviolet color, has an age less than 200 million years old, in which contributes mass fractions of less than one percent. By looking at the young star population, it is said to be fueled by cooling gas flowing out of the intracluster medium.\nAccording to researchers, Abell 2219 BCG has a hot X-ray core with multiple surface brightness edges surrounding it. These galaxy edges are likely shock and cold front origins and corresponding to Mach numbers of \u223c1.15. Moreover, Abell 2219 BCG is said to be \u223c180 kpc apart from the second brightest cluster galaxy in Abell 2219, 2MASX J16402369+4642099 or PGC 3870329, classfied a low-power radio galaxy with 1.4\u00a0GHz luminosity between 2 \u00d7 1023 and 3 \u00d7 1025 W Hz\u22121. These galaxies are yet to cross each other.\nAbell 2219\nThe galaxy cluster where Abell 2219 BCG is residing, is found to be the hottest (TX = 9.5 keV) and the most X-ray luminous clusters known with luminosity of LX>= 8 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121, 0.1-2.4 keV at z = 0.2. Twice as bright compared to the Bullet Cluster and Abell 520, it is a massive cluster. It is found to gone through a violent merger-driven shock, due to collisions by other galaxy clusters and by dissipated energy that is going into the intra-cluster medium (ICM) through the injection of turbulence and acceleration of particles.\nAccording to optical and X-ray observations, researchers found clear evidence of a disturbed, elongated morphology for Abell 2219 and with more than one dominant mass clumps. According to the multiwavelength analysis, conducted by Boschin et al. (2004), this suggests a complex merger history in Abell 2219. The system is currently undergoing an in-fall of many clumps aligned together with a galactic filament in the foreground, oriented at an oblique angle with respect to the line of sight.\nAbell 2219 is notable to contain a powerful diffuse radio halo measuring (1.99 \u00b1 0.11)M 200 wide. The radio emission in the halo located inside the central regions of the cluster is dominated by a blend of discrete sources at 1.4\u00a0GHz. From Chandra X-ray space telescope observations, researchers detected traces of large-scale and high temperature shock fronts measuring \u223c 2 arcmin or \u223c430 kpc from the cluster core. Looking at observed temperature and density jumps, they found this lead to Mach numbers of >1.3 with an estimated shock velocity of \u223c2500 | $\\rm \\thinspace km\\rm \\thinspace s^{-1}\\,$ |\u2060. Surprisingly, they found that Abell 2219 also has a hot core which is >20 keV. What caused the hot core is unclear.\nThe cluster appears at a peak in velocity space, whom researchers selected 113 cluster members. They noted it by computing high values for the line-of-sight velocity dispersion, \u03c3v= 1438+109-86 km s\u22121, consistent with the high average X-ray temperature of 10.3 keV. Assuming dynamical equilibrium, the cluster is estimated to be M\u223c2.8\u00d7 1015 M\u2299 global masses.\nGravitational lensing\nAbell 2219 has two gravitational lensing arcs, as o",
    "Welsh Liberal Democrats frontbench team (2008\u20132016)\nKirsty Williams, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, formed her frontbench team of party spokespeople in the National Assembly for Wales on 11 December 2008 after she was elected to succeed Mike German as party leader on 8 December. She reshuffled her frontbench team after the 2011 National Assembly for Wales election before her party's seat share was reduced from five to one at the 2016 National Assembly for Wales election, with Williams becoming the party's sole assembly member (AM).\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 assembly election, Williams participated in the 2016 Welsh government formation as the deciding vote in the renomination of Carwyn Jones as first minister. Afterwards, Jones brought Williams into his third government. She also served under his successor Mark Drakeford before standing down at the 2021 Senedd election, where her party once again returned a single seat in the legislature, this time with Jane Dodds as the only Welsh Liberal Democrat elected into office.\nBackground\nKirsty Williams was elected to the National Assembly for Wales at the 1999 National Assembly for Wales election. She was a member of Mike German's first and second frontbench teams of party spokespeople in the assembly. After German announced his resignation in 2008, Williams stood in the leadership election to succeed him as leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats. She defeated the runner-up Jenny Randerson in the election and became the new leader of the party. At the time of her election, Williams was the first woman to lead a political party in Wales. Her party had six assembly members (AMs) in the National Assembly at the time of her election.\nHistory\nWilliams formed her frontbench team of party spokespeople on 11 December 2008. Her leadership rival Jenny Randerson was made the spokesperson for the economy and transport and the spokesperson for education, children, lifelong learning and skills. Peter Black was appointed as the group's business manager and as its spokesperson for health and local government. Other appointments to the frontbench included Eleanor Burnham as spokesperson for communities, culture and equality and Mick Bates as spokesperson for environment, sustainability and rural affairs. Commenting on her frontbench team, Williams said she appointed Randerson to the economy portfolio as the \"economy is the number one issue in politics today\".\nOn 8 February 2010, Bates was dismissed from the frontbench after he was accused of assault and put under a police investigation over an alleged incident on 20 January 2010. A mini-reshuffle followed, with former leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Mike German appointed to replace Bates in the frontbench team, taking on his portfolio in the environment, sustainability and rural affairs. Bates had already announced his intention to retire from the assembly at the 2011 National Assembly for Wales election in the previous year. German left the assembly in May 2010 to take up a seat in the House of Lords, with his seat in the assembly being taken by his wife the Welsh Liberal Democrat politician Veronica German. A reshuffle followed on 24 July 2010, with Williams becoming spokesperson for environment and rural affairs and appointing Veronica German as spokesperson for health, local government and equal opportunities. Peter Black remained business manager but became spokesperson for housing and finance. Other appointments included Eleanor Burnham as spokesperson for communities, culture, social justice and European affairs and Jenny Randerson as spokesperson for the economy and education.\nAt the assembly election in May 2011, the Welsh Liberal Democrats' share of seats was reduced from six to five. On 11 July 2011, Williams reshuffled the party's frontbench team in the assembly. All five Liberal Democrat AMs were given portfolios. Williams appointed herself as spokesperson for health and social care. Peter Black was appointed as spokesperson for local government, heritage, housing and finance and remained business manager. Newly elected AMs Elunded Parrott, Aled Roberts and William Powell were made spokesperson for enterprise, transport, Europe and business, spokesperson for children, education and the Welsh language, and spokesperson for environment, sustainability and rural affairs respectively.\nAt the 2016 National Assembly for Wales election in May 2016 the Welsh Liberal Democrats lost four of its five seats, with Williams being the only Welsh Liberal Democrat who was returned to office at the election. In the aftermath of the election, Williams held the deciding vote in the assembly vote to nominate a first minister during the 2016 Welsh government formation. The incumbent first minister Carwyn Jones of the Labour Party put himself forward for renomination but this was challenged by the nomination of Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, which was supported by the Welsh Conservatives and the UK independence Party.

    "American actress\nCorinne B. Grace (n\u00e9e Bissette, November 9, 1929 - August 23, 2016) was an actress and oil and gas producer based out of New Mexico. She had been instrumental in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reassessing the new federal regulations allowing pipelines to cancel oil and gas producer contracts as was seen in Corinne B. Grace v. El Paso Natural Gas Company. She was also instrumental in protecting stripper wells (wells with small volumes of gas production) as well as being supportive of state interpretations of FERC regulations as was seen in Transwestern Pipeline Company v. Corinne Grace. She also was part of the tax law theory of equitable recoupment being applied to city revenue from leased property with the court case of Grace v. City of Carlsbad.\nEarly life and career\nGrace was born Corinne Bissette on November 9, 1929, in Zebulon, North Carolina. Her parents were Oscar Bissette and Dolly Massey Bissette. She grew up during The Great Depression. She graduated from the University of North Carolina, Greensboro.  After graduating, she pursued a career in theatre. She went on to play Manny Davis in Twin Beds at the WRVA Theater in Richmond, Virginia and later work in two commercials, one for Blue Bonnet Bread and the other for Beacon Wax.\nIn 1954, she married theater producer Michael P. Grace II. The wedding was held at Michael Grace's alma mater, the University of Notre Dame at the university's chapel of the Sacred Heart. They would both later start a career in oil and gas production.\nOil and Gas Production\nStarting 1960, Michael and Corinne Grace started an oil and gas company in Southeast New Mexico. They were involved in various oil and gas operations. After her divorce in 1982, she was involved in the following hearings at FERC which affected the oil and gas industry:\nThe El Paso Natural Gas buildingCorinne B. Grace v. El Paso Natural Gas Company\nTranswestern Pipeline Company v. Corinne Grace\nCorinne B. Grace v. El Paso Natural Gas\nIn the 1990 hearing against El Paso Natural Gas, the effects of the then recent Natural Gas Wellhead Deregulation Act of 1989 were called into question. Although Grace did not win the case, FERC made the following statement:Order No. 490 was never intended to be an unconstrained grant of regulatory authority to interstate pipelines to terminate and abandon small producer contracts, subject only to later judicial review of the contract expiration dispute.\u00a0 At a minimum, the Commission should investigate the types of serious allegations presented here by the complainant and render a decision based on the substantive merits.\u00a0 As a practical matter, in the absence of such investigation, many small producers effectively will have no remedy of any kind in the event of such alleged pipeline conduct, because a contract lawsuit will be financially burdensome, if not impossible. Consequently, I urge the Commission to reconsider this policy.El Paso Natural Gas is presently a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners.\nTranswestern Pipeline Company v. Corinne Grace\nAlso in 1990 was the case where Grace was the defendant and Transwestern Pipeline, which was at that time was a subsidiary of Enron, was the plaintiff. The hearing resulted in FERC recognizing a state's interpretation of federal rules and regulations in terms of specific type of geology. In this case, the state was New Mexico. FERC made the following statement about the issue in support of wells which produce little natural gas (stripper wells):New Mexico has approved recompletions such as Grace's as enhanced recovery techniques under section 108, but it has not approved applications for a new onshore reservoir determination under section 102 for any well in the pool, even if the well appears not to be in communication with any other well in the pool, because the pool produced before April 20, 1977. This result is also consistent with the pricing scheme established in the NGPA because the section 102 ceiling price, which applies to gas from new onshore reservoirs which did not produce before April 20, 1977, was intended to reward producers for incurring the risks involved in exploring for new sources of gas.\u00a0 Since producers who drill in the pool know that if they drill to a certain depth that they will encounter the Morrow Formation, with the possibility of multiple pay zones, they do not bear as great a risk as other producers.\nIn Grace v. City of Carlsbad, 126 N.M. 95 (N.M. Ct. App. 1998), the City of Carlsbad, New Mexico had leased property to Grace for the production of oil and gas. Grace had unfortunately overpaid the city and the statute of limitations for recovering from the mistake had expired. The unique application of equitable recoupment from tax law was presented in the court case as way to recoup the overpayment as the city was to receive future oil gas revenue.\n",

The film will premiere during Christmas 2024 on BBC One and BBC iPlayer in the United Kingdom and on Netflix internationally.\nThis will be the sixth Wallace and Gromit film, the first since A Matter of Loaf and Death in 2008, and their second feature-length film following The Curse of the Were-Rabbit in 2005. This film marks the return of Feathers McGraw, the villainous penguin from The Wrong Trousers in 1993.\nPremise\nGromit's concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified when Wallace invents a 'smart gnome' that seems to develop an evil mind of its own. When it emerges that a vengeful figure from the past might be masterminding things, it falls to Gromit to battle sinister forces and save his master\u2026 or Wallace may never be able to invent again!\u2014\u200aNetflix\nVoice cast\nSee also: List of Wallace and Gromit characters\nBen Whitehead as Wallace, an eccentric inventor from Northern England.

    "\nMilitary unit\nThe Fermanagh Militia, later the Fermanagh Light Infantry, was an Irish militia regiment raised in 1793 for home defence and internal security during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. It also served during the Crimean War and Indian Mutiny. In 1881 it became a battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and was embodied in the Second Boer War. During World War I, as part of the Special Reserve, it trained thousands of reinforcements for battalions of that regiment serving overseas. Postwar it retained a shadowy existence until it was formally disbanded in 1953.\nBackground\nAlthough there are scattered references to town guards in 1584, no organised militia existed in Ireland before 1660. After that, some militia forces were organised in the reign of King Charles II and in the war between James II and William III, but it was not until 1715 that the Irish Militia came under statutory authority. During the 18th Century there were various Volunteer Associations and local militia units controlled by the landowners, concerned mainly with internal security. In 1778, during the War of American Independence, the threat of invasion by the Americans' allies, France and Spain, appeared to be serious. While most of the Regular Army was fighting overseas, the coasts of England and Wales were defended by the embodied Militia, but Ireland had no equivalent force. Under the leadership of George Ogle, the Parliament of Ireland passed a Militia Act. This failed to create an effective militia force but opened the way for the Irish Volunteers to fill the gap; even Ogle became a general in the Volunteers. The paramilitary Volunteers, however, were outside the control of either the parliament or the Dublin Castle administration. The invasion threat having receded, the Volunteers diminished in numbers but remained a political force. On the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War In 1793, the Irish administration passed an effective Militia Act that created an official Irish Militia, while the paramilitary volunteers were banned. The new Act was based on existing English precedents, with the men conscripted by ballot to fill county quotas (paid substitutes were permitted) and the officers having to meet certain property qualifications.\nFermanagh Militia\nUnder the new Act County Fermanagh was given a quota of 356 men to raise as a battalion of 6 companies, and on 3 May the regiment was ordered to be formed at Enniskillen.\nFrench Revolutionary War\nThe first task for the Governor of Fermanagh was to appoint the adjutant, non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and drummers, before the balloted men could be assembled; in most Irish militia units a proportion of these were experienced men obtained from the Regular Army. Initially there was some difficulty in providing arms for the new regiments, and  many were bought second-hand. In September a detachment of the battalion formed part of a 400-strong force including some Regular cavalry, infantry, and artillery, sent to prevent a planned review of the illegal Volunteers at a village outside Belfast. The force quietly marched out to the site at 05.00 without beat of drums, and the review did not then take place.\nTo prevent the militia from being influenced by their friends and neighbours, the regiments were moved around the country. By the end of August 1794 the Fermanagh Militia was quartered at Newry. In February 1794 the regiments were each ordered to form a 24-man detachment to man the light cannon issued as 'battalion guns'. These detachments were trained at central  'schools of instruction'. Early in 1795 the Irish government ordered an augmentation of the militia from 1 April; the establishment of the Fermanagh Militia was increased to 460 rank and file. The additional men were to be found by voluntary enlistment where possible. In that year the practice of gathering the militia into summer training camps began. In July the Fermanagh Militia was in camp at Lehaunstown when it was ordered to send a party to disperse an illegal gathering in County Kildare.\nAnxiety abut a possible French invasion grew during the autumn of 1796 and preparations were made for field operations. A large French expeditionary force appeared in Bantry Bay on 21 December and troops from all over Ireland were marched towards the threatened area. However, the French fleet was scattered by winter storms, several ships being wrecked, and none of the French troops succeeded in landing; there was no sign of a rising by the United Irishmen. The invasion was called off on 29 December, and the troop concentration was dispersed in early 1797. At the same time the Light companies were detached to join composite battalions drawn from several militia regiments. When the militiamen of 1793 reached the end of their four-year enlistment in 1797, most of the Irish regiments were able to maintain their numbers through re-enlistments (for a bounty). At the time of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 the strength o",

    "Chinese anarchist (1898\u20131927)\nWong Sau Ying (Chinese: \u9ec3\u7d20\u82f1; c.\u20091898\u20131927), also known by her alias Wong Sang, was a Chinese anarchist, known for her attempt to assassinate colonial officials in British Malaya.\nBorn in Imperial China, in 1919, she moved to British Malaya, where she became involved in the Malayan anarchist movement. Her lover, a Malayan anarchist, was deported by the British authorities and shot by order of the Chinese authorities. By 1925, she was plotting to assassinate Laurence Guillemard, the British High Commissioner of Malaya, but missed her opportunity. She then went to the Chinese Protectorate in Kuala Lumpur, where she detonated a bomb, injuring a colonial official and herself.\nHer trial became a spectacle, in part due to the fixation of both the press and the British administration on her bob cut. She was reported to have smiled calmly through the proceedings, pleading guilty and refusing to explain her actions. Although the prosecution understood her to have had vague anarchist political motivations, the British authorities were unable to provide a clear explanation for her motives. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison, where she committed suicide by hanging.\nIn the wake of the bombing case, the Malayan anarchist movement came under heavy political repression, severely weakening it. Chinese women with bob cuts also came under suspicion, as press and state authorities began to associate the hair cut with anarchist political motivations.\nEarly life and activism\nWong Sau Ying was born in China, c.\u20091898. She spent time in Beijing and Shanghai, and from an early age, she was involved with the Chinese anarchist movement in Canton. By 1919, she had moved to Penang, in British Malaya. She was one of the first Chinese women to become involved in politics in Malaya, where women were largely involved in social issues and did not engage with politics. She also dressed in a modern fashion, keeping her hair cut short and refusing to wear a hat, which made her stand out among the women of her day.\nShe soon joined the Malayan anarchist movement, in which her lover Mak Peng-cho was a prominent member. Their house was raided by police, who discovered pamphlets implicating Mak in the Chinese anarchist movement, forcing him to flee to China, before returning again in May 1923. In July 1923, Mak was deported for his continued involvement in the anarchist movement. Wong followed him to Canton, where he was shot for his anarchist activities in February 1924, by order of the local Chinese authorities. In December 1924, she moved to Singapore, where she quickly contacted the local anarchist movement, taking shelter with the anarcho-communist film-makers Luk Ngai-man and Wang Yu-ting.\nAssassination attempts\nIn early 1925, she plotted to assassinate Laurence Guillemard, the British high commissioner of Malaya, who she considered a representative of \"a system which hinders the progress of the world\". She purchased bomb-making materials, and together with her comrade Yat Mun, she tracked Guillemard's movements throughout the peninsular. She missed her chance to assassinate him at the Penang golf course and again when he was on board a train to Kuala Lumpur, as he got off early to visit the Sultan of Kuala Kangsar. She decided to continue with her explosives to Kuala Lumpur, where she planned to attack the Chinese Protectorate.\nOn 23 January 1925, Chinese New Year's Eve, she made her way to the Protector's office, carrying a briefcase. In the office, she came face to face with Protector Daniel Richards and his assistant Wilfred Blythe. She claimed that someone was threatening her and gave Richards her briefcase, saying a friend had told her to give it to him. She opened the case and stepped back as it exploded, blowing a hole in the table and showering the room with shrapnel. Richards and Wong, both injured and unconscious, were rushed to nearby hospitals. The lightly packed bomb had failed to kill its target, although Richards lost one of his hands. Wong had shrapnel removed from her arms, face and torso, all the while under armed guard.\nThe attack became a sensational story in the British press, which dubbed Wong \"the bobbed-hair woman\" and wildly speculated about her identity and motive. The \"Kuala Lumpur Bomb Outrage\", as it became known, was the most striking violent attack committed by the Malayan anarchist movement up until that point.\nTrial and imprisonment\nShe first appeared in court six days after the attack; the press that reported on the trial were obsessed with her appearance, from her short hair to her scars. At another appearance in court in February, when her name was finally revealed to the public, she was noted to appear calm when walking to the dock and smile when the charges against her were read. The British colonial authorities considered her \"new style\", from her haircut to her education and grievances with the world order, to be at the centre of the case.\nOn 23 March, her trial at the ",
    "Language of Indonesia\nThe Mukomuko language (bahaso Mukomuko) is a language in the Minangkabau language family spoken by the Mukomuko people, a subgroup of the Minangkabau people living in Mukomuko Regency in northern Bengkulu that borders West Sumatra. In 1993, there were an estimated 26,000 Mukomuko speakers.  Mukomuko is closely related to the Minangkabau language and shares similarities with the Pancung Soal dialect, spoken in the southern part of Pesisir Selatan Regency in West Sumatra. The distribution area of this dialect also extends to the northern part of Mukomuko Regency. Geographically, Mukomuko is situated on the border between Bengkulu and West Sumatra, which fosters interaction between the people of Mukomuko and the Minangkabau. This proximity results in a culturally rich environment, representing the convergence of two or more cultures.\nThe native inhabitants of northern Mukomuko are the Minangkabau people. Traditionally, culturally, and linguistically, they are closely related to the Pesisir Selatan of West Sumatra. In the past, the Mukomuko region was part of the Pesisir Selatan diaspora of the Minangkabau. In addition to the Minangkabau, the southern part of Mukomuko regency is inhabited by the Pekal people. The Mukomuko region is also a Minangkabau diaspora (rantau) area, often referred to as the Riak nan Berdebur region, along the west coast from Padang to South Bengkulu. However, since the British colonial period, the Mukomuko region has been politically separated from West Sumatra. Since then, the Mukomuko people have been separated from their relatives in West Sumatra, which continued to the Dutch colonial period, the Japanese occupation, and into the independence era. Centuries of separation have resulted in the Mukomuko language gradually diverging from standard Minangkabau, particularly in its vocabulary. However, despite these changes, mutual intelligibility between the two dialects generally persists.\nThe Minangkabau language has been regarded as the lingua franca in northern Bengkulu, exerting its influence on neighboring languages like Bengkulu Malay, particularly in terms of phonology and vocabulary.\nClassification\nMukomuko belongs to the Malayic languages branch of the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup of the Austronesian language family, which also includes Malay and standard Indonesian. Linguistically, it shares a strong resemblance with the Minangkabau language, particularly the Pesisir Selatan dialect spoken in the neighboring Pesisir Selatan Regency. Lexically, the Mukomuko language shares approximately 86% to 90% of its vocabulary with the Pesisir Selatan dialect. Due to these linguistic similarities, some research suggests classifying Mukomuko as a dialect of Minangkabau.\nGeographical distribution and usage\nThe majority of Mukomuko speakers lives in North Mukomuko District and South Mukomuko District of the Mukomuko Regency in northern Bengkulu. The capital of North Mukomuko District is Mukomuko, while the capital of South Mukomuko District is Ipuh. North Mukomuko District comprises 39 hamlets, and South Mukomuko District comprises 30 hamlets. In addition to Mukomuko, the community in these districts also speaks Javanese and Kerinci. Javanese is primarily spoken by transmigrants from Java, whereas Kerinci is spoken in the hamlets of Sungai Ipuh, Pondok Baru, and Sungai Jarinjing in North Mukomuko District. The geographical range of Mukomuko language speakers extends from Pondok Suguh hamlet in the south to Lubuk Pinang hamlet in the north.\nMukomuko generally only functions as a social language. It is used within family and community environments in daily life in informal settings. During wedding ceremonies, public meetings, mosque sermons, and other ceremonies, the Mukomuko people tend to code-switch between Indonesian and Mukomuko. Meanwhile, in government offices, schools, and formal settings, Indonesian is used. However, in the early grades of elementary school, teachers from the Mukomuko area often use the Mukomuko language to present the material. In markets and among the general public, the Mukomuko language is used among members of the Mukomuko community, while between people from different areas, a mix of Mukomuko and Indonesian or other regional languages is used.\nAs of 2024, recognizing the importance of preserving local languages, the regional government of Mukomuko has initiated the inclusion of regional languages such as Rejang, Mukomuko, and Serawai in the school curriculum.\nPhonology\nVowels\nLike other Malayic languages, there are five different vowels in Mukomuko, which are  /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/, and /o/. The Mukomuko language mostly follows the standard Indonesian orthography. The table below illustrates the vowel chart of the Mukomuko language.\nConsonants\nThere are twenty consonants in Mukomuko, which are /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/, /q/, /c/, /j/, /\u0263/, /r/, /s/, /l/, /m/, /n/, /h/, /\u014b/, /\u0272/, /w/, and /y/.

    "The Licensing Act of 1904 was a controversial Act of the British Parliament regulating the closure of public houses (pubs) in England and Wales. It was introduced by the Home Secretary,  supported by \nPrime Minister Arthur Balfour. and passed by his Conservative Party.\nThe issue helped the Liberal Party win the  1906 United Kingdom general election by a landslide. The Licensing Act of 1904 aimed to reduce the number of pubs. It proposed to compensate brewers for the cancellation of their licence, through a fund the brewers themselves would have to pay into. This led many Nonconformists who adhered to temperance to denounce it as a \"brewers' bill\". Meanwhile, the brewers themselves were  generally dissatisfied, and they let their customers know.\nSee also\nAlcohol licensing laws of the United Kingdom\nIndex of drinking establishment\u2013related articles\nPub\nNotes\n^ Ruddock F.

    "Early association football club from north Wales\nFootball club\nWhite Stars F.C., also known as White Star or Newtown White Stars, was an association football club from Newtown, Powys, active in the 1870s, and (indirectly) a progenitor club of the current Newtown club.\nHistory\nFoundation\nThe club was formed at a meeting at the Greyhound Inn at a date variously given as 1873 1874, or 1875; the club was certainly playing by 1876 as there was confusion between the White Stars and the Newtown club.\n1877\u201378 season\nThe White Stars entered the first Welsh Cup in 1877\u201378.  The club won 1\u20130 at Ruabon in the first round and drew at Aberystwyth in the second, but Aberystwyth scratched from the replay and the Stars were drawn to play Druids at Plasmadoc in the \"final five\" stage.  The White Stars played a defensive game in the tie to earn a home replay, which the White Stars won thanks to scrimmaging the only goal in the first half, but the result was overturned on appeal, on the basis that the home crowd kept coming onto the pitch every time the Druids threatened the White Stars' goal, and the referee failed to award a goal to Druids after a Ketley shot was only stopped behind the goal-line - and were not given a free-kick after goalkeeper Tom Jones carried the ball for several yards in the aftermath in contradiction to the laws at the time.  Indeed a story was later bruited that the White Star supporters had been brandishing knives.  The second replay was played at Oswestry and the Druids put the tie beyond any doubt with a 3\u20130 win.\nWelsh Cup winner\nNewtown White Stars\nThe Stars gained ample compensation in the 1878\u201379 Welsh Cup.  The club was not considered one of the stronger entries in the competition, but won through to the third round after two away wins.  In the third, the club met Bangor at Wrexham, and after being two goals to the good, were forced into a replay after it conceded a bizarre late own-goal, defenders trying to get out of the way of a goal-bound throw-in but one inadvertently touching the ball en route.  The replay, at Chester, ended in controversy; half-an-hour into the game, with the White Stars 3\u20131 up, a fight between two players on the pitch was interrupted by the Bangor umpire punching a White Star player to the ground, and the match abandoned.  The Welsh Association ordered a replay, but Bangor refused to accept the decision, and resigned from the Welsh FA.\nIn  club reached the semi-final, where it was drawn to play Newtown.  The first match, at Oswestry, ended in a draw, and the replay, at Newtown's ground, went the White Stars' way 2\u20131, holding on after scoring twice in the first half-an-hour.  The final against Wrexham was played at Oswestry, where the White Stars proved to be the favourites with the thousand-strong crowd, even though they were the outsiders; one expert stating that he would bet \"Lombard Street to a bottle of pop\" on the Wrexhamites.  However the White Stars won 1\u20130, the winning goal coming on the hour when Rees followed up up after a Davies shot was saved.\nFailed merger\nDespite the Cup win, in August 1879, the White Stars' secretary wrote to his opposite number at Newtown with a view to fielding a combined club in the Welsh Cup.  A new club, Excelsior, was duly formed, but although most of the Newtown players joined it, most of the White Stars remained aloof, or played for Excelsior in addition to the Stars.\nThe White Stars' defence of the Cup ended against the eventual winners Druids in the \"semi\" final (due to an imbalance in the draw, there were 3 teams remaining at the time) at Oswestry, the match being delayed by the referee not turning up and the clubs having to select a suitable individual from the crowd; the White Stars never recovered after conceding twice in the opening nine minutes.  By this time White Stars was in the process of swallowing Excelsior - the clubs met in February 1880, White Stars winning by 4 (or 5) goals to nil, and by the 1880\u201381 season many of the former Newtown players(such as goalkeeper Hibbott, captain Edward Morgan, and forward Gittins) were all playing for the White Stars.\nFinal season and revival as Newtown\nMore players joined the White Stars later in the season, in time to play for the White Stars in the 1881 Welsh Cup final on Wrexham's Racecourse Ground.  The match attracted a crowd of 3,000, of whom 700 had come on special trains from Newtown.  Druids again proved to be the White Stars' nemesis, winning 2\u20130, the second goal coming when Hibbott was charged through the goal having just caught a Vaughan shot.\nThe White Stars protested the eligibility of the Druids' captain Jack Powell, to no avail.  The failure of the protest seems to have dispirited the team to the extent that it did not re-emerge for the 1881\u201382 season.  Indeed, football in Newtown went into abeyance until a meeting at the Lion Hotel on 23 July 1884 re-established a Newtown association football club.  Notably, many of those involved with the new club, including play",
    "1948 coup d'\u00e9tat in Peru\nThe 1948 Peruvian coup d'\u00e9tat took place on October 27, 1948, headed by general Manuel A. Odr\u00eda in Arequipa, referred to by him as the \"Restorative Revolution\" (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n Restauradora), against the government Jos\u00e9 Luis Bustamante y Rivero. The military coup gave way to a period of almost twenty months in which the deposed president was prosecuted, a state of emergency was declared throughout the country, and the national congress was dissolved.\nBackground\nJos\u00e9 Luis Bustamante y Rivero became the president of Peru in the 1945 elections with the support of the National Democratic Front, an alliance of parties including APRA (under the name \"People's Party\"), the Peruvian Communist Party, and other democratic and left-leaning parties. He also had the support of unionists and the popular classes.\nBustamante's government had to face difficult political and social situations, such as the predominance of APRA in Congress and the subsequent confrontation between executive and legislative, and the murder allegedly at the hands of Apristas of the director of the newspaper La Prensa, Francisco Gra\u00f1a Garland\u00a0. The disagreements between the conservative and military sectors with the government due to the refusal to distance itself from APRA caused the crisis to escalate until the resignation of the cabinet chaired by Julio Ernesto Portugal\u00a0.\nThe turning point for the export oligarchy and the anti-APRA sectors to begin the path to taking power through a coup d'\u00e9tat occurred on October 3, 1948, with the uprising of the sailors in Callao, encouraged by the APRA and related soldiers.\nCoup\nOn October 27, 1948, Manuel A. Odr\u00eda, who had been Minister of Government and Police in the Bustamante y Rivero government, revolted at the head of the Arequipa garrison. He called his subversive act the \"Restorative Revolution.\" A visibly nervous Odr\u00eda read his Manifesto to the Nation on Radio Continental, in which he declared the following:\nThe revolution that broke out in Arequipa is for a just, noble and patriotic cause: to save the armed institutes that are the basis of national defence; rebuild democratic life, reestablish the rule of the Constitution and, finally, end the period of misery and hunger that overwhelms our people.\u2014\u200aManuel A. Odr\u00eda\nThe other garrisons in the country, such as Cuzco and those in the north of the country, hesitated to join the movement initiated in Arequipa, but its triumph was decided when the garrison at Lima, under the command of General Zen\u00f3n Noriega, joined Odr\u00eda. The coup d'\u00e9tat culminated successfully with the deportation of President Bustamante to Buenos Aires. Noriega assumed interim power, as President of the Military Junta, until the arrival of Odr\u00eda on October 29, 1948.\nSee also\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\nOdr\u00eda's post-coup speech (in Spanish)\nHistory of Peru (1948\u20131956)\n",

    "\nCleo Hill Jr. (born September 1966) is an American basketball coach who is the current head coach of the Maryland Eastern Shore Hawks men's basketball team. He played college basketball for the North Carolina Central Eagles and has previously coached at the collegiate level for the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Shaw Bears, Cheyney Wolves and Winston-Salem State Rams.\nEarly life\nHill was born in September 1966, the son of Cleo Hill, who was a star basketball player for the Winston-Salem State Rams (1957\u20131961) and was a first-round NBA draft pick in 1961. He attended Orange High School in New Jersey and became a starter on the basketball team as a sophomore, remaining starter for every game afterwards. As a junior, he helped the school reach the state championship, and as a senior, he became the third player in Orange history with 1,000 career points. Among the honors he received in high school were selection to the All-State, All-County and All-City teams; he still ranks in the top ten in school scoring history as of 2024 and is an inductee to the school's hall of fame.\nHill played college basketball for the North Carolina Central Eagles from 1984 to 1988. He led the team in scoring as a freshman and was the second-leading scorer as a senior, as the team had a top ranking nationally with an appearance in the NCAA Division II Tournament. He won South Atlantic Region All-Tournament honors that year and scored over 1,000 points in his collegiate career, among the best totals in school history. He also served as team captain.\nAfter his collegiate career, Hill played in Australia for the Swan Hill Flyers of the Country Victorian Invitational Basketball League (CVIBL). He was a member of the team during the 1990 and 1991 seasons, having an average of 32 points per game in 1990 and 41 points per game in 1991. He was a CVIBL All-Star and was the most valuable player of the All-Star game with 24 points, 19 assists and 10 rebounds.\nCoaching career\nHill entered coaching in 1991, serving until 1994 as an assistant for Orange High School. He then worked with Elizabeth High School from 1994 to 1996 before joining the staff of Mount Zion Christian Academy for the 1996\u201397 season. He served two years there and helped the team compile a record of 52\u20137 with him as an assistant. Among the players he coached there was future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Tracy McGrady, and one of the teams he helped coach went 26\u20133 with a number one ranking nationally.\nHill was hired as an assistant coach for the Nebraska Cornhuskers in 1998, helping the team reach the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) while serving two years with the school. He then assisted for the Shaw Bears from 2000 to 2002, helping them win a Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) title while reaching the Final Four in the NCAA Division II Tournament. In 2003, he was appointed the head coach of the Cheyney Wolves, where he coached until 2008 and won a division championship in his first year.\nHill returned to Shaw in 2008, being named head coach. In seven years with the Bears, he compiled an overall record of 116\u201367, which included the 2011\u201312 season when they finished fifth nationally, went 27\u20134 overall, won the CIAA crown with a 16\u20130 mark and reached the NCAA Tournament. He was named the NSAA/NCAA DII Clarence Big House Gaines Coach of the Year and BOXTOROW Coach of the Year for the 2010\u201311 season and was the CIAA Coach of the Year and BOXTOROW Coach of the Year for the 2011\u201312 season.\nHill worked three years as a trainer after his stint at Shaw. In May 2018, he returned to coaching, being named the head of the Winston-Salem State Rams, where his father had began his career over 60 years earlier. In his second season, the team went 19\u201310 and won the CIAA championship, with Hill being named the conference coach of the year. After the 2020\u201321 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he helped the team win the division title in 2021\u201322, then helped them win the CIAA Tournament and reach the NCAA Division II Tournament in 2022\u201323, followed by a 19\u20139 record during 2023\u201324.\nOn June 1, 2024, Hill was announced as the head coach of the Maryland Eastern Shore Hawks.\n",
    "\nPKS 0529-549 known as MRC 0529-549 and PKS B0529-549, is a radio galaxy located in the constellation Pictor. At the redshift of 2.57, the object is located nearly 10.8 billion light-years away from Earth.\nCharacteristics\nPKS 0529-549 is one of the high redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) found. Detected from high-resolution 12-mm and 3-cm images, obtained by the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the galaxy is found to have a Type-II active galactic nucleus (AGN) showing two radio lobes. With a rest-frame of -9600 rad m-2, the eastern radio lobe holds a record for the highest Faraday rotation measure to date, signifying a strong magnetic field or either a dense circumgalactic medium.\nThe host galaxy for PKS 0529-549 is a starburst galaxy in the final stages of merging with another galaxy. The result of this galaxy merger would be progenitor of an elliptical galaxy, in which causes increasing luminosity due to high star formation in its regions. Signs of star formation included a plethora of absorption line features detected through using the deep X-shooter spectrum, stellar photospheric and wind features indicating presence of OB-type stars as well as both emission lines and low-ionization absorption features.\nFrom further observations, PKS 0529-549 has an energetic source of radiation located throughout most of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such HzRGs like PKS 0529-549 are extremely massive, including old stars (up to ~ 1012 M\u25cb), hot gas (up to ~ 1012 M\u25cb) and molecular gas (up to ~\u00a01011 M\u25cb). Furthermore, galaxies with M\u22c6 \u22731011 M\u2299 at z \u2243 2\u20133 tend to have star formation rates of order of \u223c100 M\u2299 yr\u22121. This suggests PKS\u20090529-549 lies above the mean SFR\u2013M\u22c6 relation, in the so-called star-forming main sequence.\nLike most HzRGs, PKS 0529-549 is known to host large reservoirs of interstellar dust and gas.  Apart from that, the galaxy is found to exhibit both hot dust emission at 8.0 \u03bcm, with a significant internal visual extinction (~1.6 mag), inferred from Spitzer Space Telescope near/mid-IR imaging.\nObservations\nAccording to researchers who observed PKS 0529-549 from Atacama Large Millimeter Array in Chile, it contains chlorine  and doubly ionized oxygen  which display regular velocity gradients. However, their systemic velocities and kinematic PAs differ by \u223c300\u00a0km s\u22121 and \u223c30\u00b0, respectively. The  is consistent with a rotating disc, meaning it is aligned together with both the stellar and dust components, while the  has a possible outflow trace, that is aligned with two active galactic nuclei-driven radio lobes in the host galaxy of PKS 0529\u2013549.\nMoreover, the  cube is reproduced through a 3D disc model with Vrot \u2243 310\u00a0km s\u22121 and \u03c3V \u2272 30\u00a0km s\u22121\u2060, giving Vrot/\u03c3V \u227310, comparable to local spiral galaxies. This indicates that the  disc of PKS\u20090529-549 is not particularly turbulent and indeed remarkable considering that PKS\u20090529-549 is has a star formation at the rate of at \u223c1000 M\u2299 yr\u22121. Not to mention, it hosts a powerful radio-loud active galactic nucleus, with large amount of energy injected into its interstellar medium.\nPKS 0529-549 is known to lie on the local baryonic Tully\u2013Fisher relation. This is interesting since it has both estimates of both M\u22c6 and Mmol, other than Vrot and \u03c3V according to researchers who studied the galaxy. The stellar mass of PKS 0529-549 according to them, are estimated to be M\u22c6/L = 0.5 M\u25cb/L\u25cb which is similar for all galaxies, as expected from stellar population synthesis models with a Kroupa IMF.\nResearchers further measured the rotation velocities along the flat part of the rotation curve (Vflat) in PKS 0529\u2013549. This is probed by deep H\u2009I observations by Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves. In the case, Vrot is an intensity-weighted estimate over the semimajor axis, since the  emission is resolved with \u223c2 beams. Thus, one might wonder whether they are probing Vflat. Local galaxies that have similar masses as PKS\u20090529-549 normally have rotation curves, peaking at very small radii (R \u2272 1 kpc). These tend to decline by around \u223c20\u201330\u2009percent before reaching Vflat. This suggests some massive galaxies like PKS 0529-549 are in place and kinematically relaxed at z \u2243 2.6, when the universe was only \u223c2.5\u2009billion years old.\n",

It is expected to launch after the teams' contract with NBC Sports Chicago expires on October 1, 2024.\nHistory\nChicago's sports teams had originally vacated FSN Chicago in 2004 after Jerry Reinsdorf, Bill Wirtz, and the Tribune Company\u2014the owners of the Bulls, White Sox, Blackhawks, and Cubs respectively\u2014formed a new regional sports network with Comcast known as Comcast SportsNet Chicago (now NBC Sports Chicago). The network would be jointly owned by the four teams, while Comcast would hold a 30% stake and handle operations.\nThe Cubs departed the network in 2020, forming Marquee with Sinclair Broadcast Group as the exclusive broadcaster of all regional Cubs games (the games had previously been split between NBC Sports Chicago, WGN-TV, and WLS-TV). Concurrently in 2019, NBC Sports Chicago signed a five-year extension with the Blackhawks, Bulls, and White Sox, making it the exclusive home of all three teams through the end of the 2023\u201324 season.\nIn April 2024, the Chicago Sun-Times  reported that the three teams were in negotiations with Stadium to assume their regional rights after the conclusion of their contract with NBC Sports Chicago. Stadium is owned by the White Sox's investment arm Silver Chalice, and had previously been a joint venture with Sinclair until they sold their stake in 2023. In May 2024, The Athletic subsequently reported an agreement with Standard Media that would involve a newly launched multi-platform regional sports network; the Sun-Times later reported that Standard Media would primarily serve as a funding and distribution partner, and that Stadium was to serve as the teams' new home.\nOn June 3, 2024, the three teams and Standard Media officially announced Chicago Sports Network; it will be led by former Stadium CEO Jason Coyle. Unlike most regional sports networks, Chicago Sports Network is expected to be made available via over-the-air networks and streaming services along with traditional cable providers.\n",

As a result, Drasche-L\u00e1z\u00e1r retired from politics.\nIn 1930, Drasche-L\u00e1z\u00e1r became the head of IBUSZ (Idegenforgalmi Beszerz\u00e9si Utaz\u00e1si \u00e9s Sz\u00e1ll\u00edt\u00e1si), a travel agency based in Budapest, and in 1932 he became the editor-in-chief of a Budapest trade union newspaper.\nLiterary career\nThroughout his literary career, Drasche-L\u00e1z\u00e1r wrote twenty-one novels, three plays, and a one-act poem. He mainly wrote dramatic fiction, with historical fiction and science fiction influences.\nDrasche-L\u00e1z\u00e1r's literary career began in 1906 when a portfolio of short stories he had submitted appeared in the newspapers Magyar H\u00edrlap and Pester Lloyd. He achieved further success in 1917 with the release of his novel T\u0171zpr\u00f3ba (English: Fire Test). T\u0171zpr\u00f3ba was adapted into a film in 1918 by Lux Film Factory.

During the summer after her junior year, she was an intern at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, an experience she credited with inspiring her to pursue a career in museums. Ash-Milby received a master's degree in Native American art history from the University of New Mexico.\nCareer\nEarly curatorial career\nAsh-Milby began her career as a curatorial research assistant at the George Gustav Heye Center in New York City, a branch location of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI).\nAmerican Indian Community House\nIn 2001 Ash-Milby began working at the American Indian Community House (AICH) Gallery, a New York nonprofit that provides services for Native people living in the city. Ash-Milby served as curator and co-director of the AICH Gallery alongside artist G. Peter Jemison. In 2005, Ash-Milby curated a solo show for the gallery by artist Jeffrey Gibson.\nNational Museum of the American Indian\nAsh-Milby returned to the NMAI's Heye Center in 2005, first as an assistant curator and eventually as an associate curator.\nWhile at NMAI, Ash-Milby organized a large number of exhibitions, including a solo show by Edgar Heap of Birds produced as a collateral exhibition for the 52nd Venice Biennale, and solo shows at the museum by C. Maxx Stevens in 2012 and Kay WalkingStick in 2015. She also produced several thematic exhibitions for the museum, including Off the Map: Landscape in the Native Imagination (2007); HIDE: Skin as Material and Metaphor (2010); and Transformer: Native Art in Light and Sound (2017).\nAsh-Milby's final exhibition for NMAI, a retrospective on artist Oscar Howe, opened after her departure.\nPortland Art Museum\nIn 2018 Ash-Milby was named Curator of Native American Art at the Portland Art Museum (PMA), where she began in 2019.\nAsh-Milby has overseen the repatriation of several objects, artifacts, and artworks from the museum's collection by Native makers that had been stolen or improperly purchased by their donors, which she said was a priority in her time at the museum.\nIn conjunction with the 60th Venice Biennale in 2024, Ash-Milby commissioned and co-curated artist Jeffrey Gibson's solo exhibition The Space in Which to Place Me for the American pavilion. The exhibition, commissioned by the PMA and SITE Santa Fe, was the first solo exhibition by an Indigenous artist to represent the United States at the Biennale, and Ash-Milby was the first Indigenous person to curate an exhibition for the American pavilion.\nPublications\nBooks\nOff the Map: Landscape in the Native Imagination (2007).

    "Eigil (died 29 May 870), also spelled Eigel, Eogil, Egil, Egilo or Heigil, was the abbot of Pr\u00fcm from 853 to 860, abbot of Flavigny from 860 to 865 and archbishop of Sens from 865 until his death.\nEigil was a monk at Pr\u00fcm in August 843, when he was the recipient of two letters from Lupus of Ferri\u00e8res. Like his fellow monk Ansbald and Abbot Markward\u00a0, he cooperated with Lupus to collate classical texts. In a letter to Markward, Lupus writes that \"Eigil, the faithful interpreter of my affairs, will explain what I want you to do in regard to Suetonius and Josephus.\" Eigil and several other monks of Pr\u00fcm visited the abbey of Ferri\u00e8res in the summer of 847, after having recovered from a serious illness.\nEigil succeeded Markward as abbot in 853. Five diplomas in favour of Pr\u00fcm were issued by the Emperor Lothair I during 853\u2013855. He fell out with his successor, King Lothair II, over the latter's divorce from Theutberga.\nEigil was still abbot of Pr\u00fcm when he attended the Council of Aachen on 9 January 860, which dealt with Lothair's attempted divorce. Not long after, he voluntarily resigned his abbacy and relocated to West Francia, perhaps claiming illness. He was granted the abbacy of Flavigny by King Charles the Bald later that year or in 861. He was present when the king gave the original copy of the Annals of Saint-Bertin to Archbishop Hincmar of Reims. He transferred the relics of Saint Regina to Flavigny.\nEigil succeeded Wenilo as archbishop of Sens in 865. He discontinued Wenilo's rivalry with Hincmar. He presided over the Council of Soissons in 866 concerning the dispute over clerics ordained by Ebbo. He crossed the Alps to deliver the council's letter to Pope Nicholas I and also to act as Charles the Bald's envoy in the case of the divorce of Lothair II. In two letters of 866, Hincmar wrote to him about the prison conditions of the accused heretic Gottschalk of Orbais and about the case of Ebbo's clerics. On 20 May 867, according to the Annals of Saint-Bertin, Eigil \"brought to the lord Charles letters from Pope Nicholas to Lothar and the bishops of his realm concerning the case of his wives ...  transmitted the pope's command that Waldrada be sent to Rome.\"\nNotes\n^ a b c Levillain 1949, p.\u00a033.\n^ a b c d Pohl 2023, p.\u00a0330.\n^ a b Regenos 1966, p.\u00a074.\n^ Nelson 1991, p.\u00a0133.\n^ Heidecker 2010, p.\u00a074n.\n^ a b Heidecker 2010, p.\u00a038.\n^ a b Regenos 1966, p.\u00a044.\n^ Gillis 2017, p.\u00a0215.\n^ Regenos 1966, pp.\u00a044, 46.\n^ Regenos 1966, pp.\u00a050, 81.\n^ Regenos 1966, p.\u00a082.\n^ Stone & West 2016, pp.\u00a0105\u2013106 and n95.\n^ Heidecker 2010, p.\u00a076n.\n^ Tellenbach 1962, pp.\u00a05\u20136.\n^ a b Nelson 1991, p.\u00a010.\n^ Pohl 2023, p.\u00a0325.\n^ Gillis 2017, pp.\u00a0215\u2013216.\n^ Nelson 1991, pp.\u00a0132\u2013134.\n^ Gillis 2017, p.\u00a0148.

    "German politician (1921\u20131993)\nHerbert Ziegenhahn (27 October 1921 \u2013 29 June 1993) was a German politician and party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as the longtime First Secretary of the SED in Bezirk Gera and was a member of the Central Committee of the SED.\nLife and career\nEarly career\nHerbert Ziegenhahn was born on 27 October 1921, as the son of a small farming family in Dankerode. After completing elementary school, he attended an agricultural vocational school and worked from 1936 to 1941 as a farm laborer, mason, and in his parents' business.\nAs a soldier in the Wehrmacht, he served as a gunner and in a sound-ranging company. Ziegenhahn was captured by the Soviets during the war and returned to Germany in 1949 after attending Antifa schools.\nIn 1950, he became a municipal representative and in 1951, the mayor of his hometown Dankerode, and shortly thereafter of Harzgerode. In 1951, he joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn 1952, the party appointed him as the First Secretary of the SED in Quedlinburg, a position he held until 1959. Simultaneously, the SED delegated him to a distance-learning program at the \"Karl Marx\" Party Academy from 1954 to 1960, which he completed with a degree in social sciences.\nFrom 1959 to 1963, Ziegenhahn served as the First Secretary of the SED in Dessau.\nBezirk Gera SED First Secretary\nZiegenhahn (center) greeting Erich Honecker (right) on a visit to Jena in May 1986\nIn January 1963 (VI. Party Congress), Ziegenhahn was elected as a candidate member of the Central Committee of the SED and succeeded Paul Roscher as First Secretary of the Bezirk Gera SED on 14 February. Roscher was promoted to First Secretary of the SED in the much larger Bezirk Karl-Marx-Stadt.\nAdditionally, later in 1963, he was given a mandate by his party as a representative of the Volkskammer, nominally representing a constituency in the northeast of his Bezirk. In September 1966, Ziegenhahn became a full member of the Central Committee of the SED.\nHe held all these positions until the political change in the GDR in the fall of 1989.\nZiegenhahn's tenure was viewed negatively, him being seen as a model student of the SED headquarters and him becoming increasingly intolerant of criticism from subordinates.\nZiegenhahn was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in silver, in Gold in 1971, the Order of Karl Marx in 1981 and the Banner of Labor in 1984.\nPeaceful Revolution\nDuring the Wende, on 2 November 1989, the Bezirk Gera SED removed him from the position of First Secretary and installed reformer Erich Postler as his successor. He was removed by his party from the Volkskammer two weeks later, on 16 November 1989.\nAt its last session on 3 December 1989, the Central Committee expelled Ziegenhahn from the Central Committee and from the SED shortly before its collective resignation \"due to the severity of their violations against the SED statute and in consideration of numerous demands and requests from district delegate conferences.\"\nZiegenhahn faced an arrest warrant in January 1990, an investigation being underway against him for breach of trust. He was however released from pre-trial detention on 13 February due to his poor health.\nReunified Germany\nZiegenhahn passed away in 1993 at the age of 71.\nZiegenhahn's son, Herbert Ziegenhahn Jr., was an unsuccessful candidate for the WASG in the 2006 Gera mayoral election and was a member of the WASG state executive committee.\n",

    "Japanese anarchist-feminist (1900\u20132001)\nMochizuki Yuriko (Japanese: \u671b\u6708\u767e\u5408\u5b50; 1900\u20132001) was a Japanese anarchist-feminist writer and activist. A leading figure in the early Japanese feminist movement, she cut her hair short and advocated for women's suffrage, but eventually split from others in the feminist movement over her political views. She joined up with other anarchist-feminists, including Takamure Itsue, in criticising both Marxist feminism and the antifeminism of male anarchists. Following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, she and other revolutionary feminists moved to Manchukuo, fleeing political repression in Japan. There she established women's schools and criticised the chauvinism displayed by Japanese settler colonists, although she herself played her own role in the expansionism of the Empire of Japan.\nBiography\nEarly life and feminist activism\nMochizuki Yuriko was born in 1900.\nHaving travelled abroad to study in Europe, after World War I ended, she returned to Japan, aspiring to become a novelist. She was one of the first Japanese women that cut her hair short during the 1920s, at a time that the feminist ideal of the \"new woman\" was gaining traction, although she rejected the label herself. She recalled people reacting with shock and indignation at her new bob cut, especially in her small hometown, where her appearance caused such scandal that she was forced to move to Tokyo. Nevertheless, she continued to insist that women's liberation required that women rid themselves of \"encumbering entrapments\", from long hair to the kimono, which she believed prevented women's social advancement.\nMochizuki became a major contributor to the feminist journal Nyonin Geijutsu; in its inaugural issue, she advocated for women's suffrage in Japan. She also wrote about her experiences with poverty. She and many of her fellow contributors stopped writing for the journal, due to political differences. They went on to establish the newsletter Kagayaku, which they saw as more in line with the founding principles of their previous publication.\nAlongside Takamure Itsue, Mochizuki was one of the leading figures of Japanese anarchist-feminism, who advocated for the abolition of patriarchy and the state. Mochizuki and Takamure participated in debates against Marxist feminists, out of which, in February 1930, they established the anarchist-feminist magazine Fujin sensen (English: The Woman's Front), with Takamure as editor-in-chief. The journal was critical of Marxist feminists, as well as male anarchists, even taking aim the inegalitarian tendencies of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin. At this time, Mochizuki travelled to France, bringing back with her contributions from European anarchist-feminists and writing a biography about the French libertarian Louise Michel.\nActivities in Manchukuo\nIn the wake of the Mukden incident in 1931, Nyonin Geijutsu was banned from publication. A wave of political repression followed in Japan, forcing many Japanese revolutionaries and left-wing activists to move to Manchukuo, where they attempted to continue their social and political initiatives. Mochizuki and other Kagayaku contributors were among those that relocated to Manchukuo.  Mochizuki herself spent 10 years in Manchukuo, where she attempted to establish a \"modern utopia\". She set up a number of schools, where she taught both Japanese expatriate and native Manchu women; one of her goals being to teach Japanese women the local Manchu language.\nMochizuki was highly critical of Japanese settler colonists in Manchukuo, who segregated themselves from their Manchu neighbours and refused to integrate into Manchurian society. She likewise rejected Japanese complaints that Manchurian women weren't assimilating to Japanese culture, pointing out that many Japanese colonists were young, single men, and thus failed to uphold Japanese cultural ideals on women in society. She wrote of Japanese people that had moved to Xinjing, that \"perhaps because the New Capital is small, the Japanese here seem to be as if in a close-up, and we can see the good and the bad.\"\nHistorian Masuz\u014d Tanaka placed Mochizuki and her fellow feminist Taiko Hirabayashi at the centre of his analysis of Japanese women's role in the expansionism of the Empire of Japan.\nLater life and death\nMochizuki supported Tsuneko Gauntlett's initiatives to hold a Pan-Pacific Women's Conference in 1937, shortly before the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War.\nMochizuki Yuriko died in 2001.\nSelected works\n\"Fujin kaih\u014d no michi\"  (Nyonin geijutsu, 1928)\n\"Shindanpatsu monogatari\"  (Josei, 1928)\n\"Warera no eien Ruizu Misshieru\"  (Fujin sensen, 1930)\n\"Jiyu to katei\"  (Fujin sensen, 1930)\n\"Shinky\u014d no josei\"  (Kagayaku, 1938)\n\"Zai Man-Ri xi n\u00fcxing tan\"  (Qingnian wenhua, 1943)\n",
    "United States federal law\nThe Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act (ROSCA) is a United States federal law passed during the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama. The legislation was introduced as S.B.3386 by Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) on May 19, 2010, and signed into law on December 29, 2010.\nThe legislation was drafted to protect online consumers from being automatically enrolled in services that would lead to them receiving recurring charges without their explicit consent. Additionally, the  law places certain limits on online sellers' ability to share consumer data with third party actors.\nHistory and background\nThe bill was introduced in the aftermath of the release of two reports by the committee regarding the spread of deceptive internet sales practices. One of the reports, titled \"Aggressive Sales Tactics on the Internet and Their Impact on American Consumers\", centered on how three companies (Affinion, Webloyalty, and Vertrue) engaged in deceptive practices to auto-enroll consumers without their consent.\nSenator Jay Rockefeller, then-chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, formally introduced the legislation as S.B.3386  May 19, 2010. The legislation passed both houses of Congress ultimately signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 29, 2010.\nProvisions\nROSCA limits sellers ability to engage in \"negative option marketing\", which refers to a tactic in which an online seller considers a customer's silence or inaction as acceptance of an offer and permission to charge them.\nThe legislation mandates that online sellers disclose specific terms of their offers to customers. Additionally, the law requires covered sellers them to directly obtain consumers' billing information, rather than obtain the information through third-party online partners.\nReception and legacy\nThe Washington Post reported in 2021 that the law successfully \"combated some abuses, such as the sharing of sensitive customer data with third parties\" and put rules in place requiring companies to implement \"simple mechanisms for a consumer to stop recurring charges\".\nHowever, the report noted that the law has criticism from consumer advocates, who argue the law provides companies' loopholes to charge customers while limiting their ability to stop recurring charges. This includes company policies that require customers to sign up for a service online but prevent cancelations using the same method, and instead require customers to call customer service during business hours to cancel.\n",

    "Musical artist\nSonnyjim is a rapper and hip-hop producer from Birmingham, England.\nHe first began making music in 2005, steadily building an underground following, before reaching a significant buzz with his 2016 album Mud in My Malbec. His 2022 album White Girl Wasted with producer The Purist, featuring prominent U.S. artists MF Doom, Jay Electronica and DJ Premier, saw Sonnyjim gain more widespread attention.\nStyle and Works\nReviewers have noted Sonnyjim's laid back and nonchalant vocal delivery, with intricate lyrics covering topics of drugs, cooking and luxurious debauchery. His early influences include UK hip-hop artists like Skinnyman and U.S. east coast hip hop like Jay-Z, Nas and Roc Marciano.\nThroughout his career he has rapped with various noted U.S. hip hop artists, including MF DOOM, Jay Electronica, DJ Premier, Madlib, Roc Marciano and Buckwild. Labels he has been involved with include Daupe! and Blah Records as well as collaborations with artists on Griselda Records like Conway the Machine and Westside Gunn.\nCareer\nSonnyjim is from Birmingham, England, and is of Indian heritage. He started rapping in the mid-2000s UK hip-hop scene, appearing on mixtapes alongside British artists like Stig of the Dump and Jehst. Over the years he slowly built up an underground following, with releases like 2013's Psychonaut and the Purple Patch series, as well as founding his own label EatGood Records.\nHis 2016 Mud in My Malbec garnered considerable underground attention, including features with New York rappers Westside Gunn and Heems.\nThat sparked a run of collaborations with American rappers, from then until present. In 2018, Sonnyjim linked up with long-term acquaintance The Purist after returning from Croatia's Outlook Festival. Their sessions resulted in the track Barz Simpson, which would eventually grow into the joint project White Girl Wasted. The song title was inspired by the cartoon character Bart Simpson, the rapper David Bars and the saxophonist Gary Bartz.\nAfter recording Barz Simpson, the duo decided to contact MF DOOM for a guest verse on a whim, as they thought the track sounded like his style. Doom liked the track and recorded a verse, but soon got back to Sonnyjim and asked to license the track for an Adult Swim compilation. He and The Purist declined, but kept the track to themselves in order to expand their collaboration into a full album release.\nWhen the album dropped in 2022 the list of features including the posthumous verse from MF DOOM, alongside The Purist's eclectic sample-based productions and Sonny's laconic punchlines, saw the release gain wider attention. That included positive coverage from prominent music publications like Pitchfork, Rolling Stone and The Fader.\nIn 2023, Sonnyjim made an appearance for a freestyle session on New York radio's Hot 97 show Real Late with Peter Rosenberg.\nDiscography\nAlbums\nOrtolan and Armagnac with Lee Scott (2023, Blah Records)\nWhite Girl Wasted with The Purist (2022, Daupe!)\nNo Vi$ible Means of Income 2 with Giallo Point (2021)\nBetween the Lines with Da$h (2021)\nCoke le Roc with Buckwild (2021)\nA Joint Venture with Kev Brown (2021)\nSpencer for Hire 2 & 3 (2020)\nTailor Made Ostrich with Must Volkoff (2020)\nNo Vi$ible Means of Income with Giallo Point (2020)\nSpencer for Hire with Vic Spencer (2018, Daupe!)\nDeath by Misadventure with Conway the Machine (2018)\nMud in My Malbec (2016, Daupe!)\nSources\n^ a b c Nast, Cond\u00e9. \"Sonnyjim / The Purist: White Girl Wasted\".

    "\nThe Battle of Sarai-Sobhachand was fought between the Jat ruler of Bharatpur kingdom- Maharaja Surajmal and his rival Mughal empire's Mir Bakshi Salabat Jung in 1750.\nBackground\nMir Bakshi (head of Military department in Mughal period) Salabat Jung was not marching towards Bharatpur, in real he was ordered to help the Rathore chief of Marwar Bhakt Singh. There was a throne succession war being in progress at that time in Marwar (Jodhpur). Mir Bakshi with a 18,000 force marched from Mewat which was under Maharaja Surajmal of Bharatpur kingdom. Mir Bakshi's plan was to first deal with the Jats and then proceed to reinforcement Bhakt Singh.\nBattle\nKunwar Natwar Singh notes: The Mir Bakshi's progress was leisurely. He first stopped at Patuadi for ten days. Thereafter he ravaged Mewat and captured the mud fort of Nimrana in the Jat kingdom. This minor success made the Mir Bakshi overconfident and he haughtily dismissed an emissary from Suraj Mal and decided to teach Suraj Mal a lesson. Ajmer and Jodhpur were for the time being forgotten. Suraj Mal held his hand. He was watching and waiting. When the Mir Bakshi got to Sarai Sobhachand, the Jats descended on him. Suraj Mal with a mobile force of 6,000 surrounded the Mughals on New Year's Day 1750.\nContemporary court poet has mentioned Maharaja Surajmal was accompanied by Jat chiefs like Maharaja Bhim Singh Rana of Gohad, Rao Gokala, Suratram singh (who was leading 500 horsemen) Raja Balram Singh of Ballabhgarh kingdom had 1,000 soldiers and Maharaja Surajmal's brother Raja Pratap Singh of Weir had 500 horsemen. Mir Badshi was surrounded from all sides. He sent a message to Mughal court of Delhi which got delivered very late and the returning path was blocked by the Jat army. Surajmal's mounted gunners would come closer in small groups and without dismounting from their horses, would start firing their guns at the frightened Muslim soldiers of Mughas. Surajmal's mounted gunners had no chance of fighting the fast-moving army in the dark of night. The Jats attacked with great speed and determination and killed many men of Mughal army. Two prominent Mughal army's chiefs were killed \u2013 Ali Rustam Khan and Hakim Khan. Mir Bakshi Salabat Khan was now under the control of Surajmal.\nGirish Chandra Dwivedi writes- Next day (lst January, 1750) at midday hi men surrounded and harassed Salabat's troops under Fateh Ali (the same whom Suraj Mal had helped against Asad Khan, 1745) some 3 miles away from the Sarai. Ali Rustam Khan and Hakim Khan and HakimKhan Kheshgi led re-inforcements two hours-before sunset. But the Mughals could not cope with the mounted Jat matchlockmen. Pannic gripped the Bakhshi's camp. The Jats fired the volley of muskets causing heavy slaughter. Hakim Khan, the commander of the Bakhsni's right wing, was fighting on an elephant. Har Narain charged his horse upon the elephant and killed the Khan. Ali Rustam who led the vanguard was severely wounded. The Jats achieved a singular victory. They fell upon Salabat Khan's camp and plundered it for four \"gharres\". The Amrr-ul-Umra was so much struck with terror that it was only the vigilance of his commanders that prevented his cowardly flight. At last, after two or three days of strict confinement, the helpless Bakhshi sued for terms, He sent his Vakil (probably Fateh Ali) to Suraj Mal, offering to vacate the lands he had just recovered. Jawahar Singh was then sent to the Bakhshi to dictate peace.\nAftermath\nSalabat was forced to sue for peace, which was granted by the Jats on the following terms:\n(i) the imperial Government would promise not to cut down pipal trees, (ii) nor to hinder the worship of it, while (iii) Surajmal undertook to collect 15 lakhs of Rupees from the Rajputs as the revenue of the province of Ajmir and pay it into the imperial Exchequer, provided that the Bakhshi took his advice and did not proceed beyond Narnol (present-day Mahendragarh, Haryana).\n",
    "British architect, 1866\u20131933\nArnold Dunbar Smith FRIBA (2 December 1866\u00a0\u2013 7 December 1933) was an English architect  who in 1897 formed Smith & Brewer (1897\u00a0\u2013 1949) with Cecil Claude Brewer (1871\u00a0\u2013 1918) who were responsible for the design of the Mary Ward House in London (1899) and the National Museum and Gallery in Cardiff (1912) who are both Grade I listed buildings. \nEarly life and education\nSmith was born on 2 December 1866 in Islington, north London, England. Smith attended the Brighton School of Art, the Architectural Association School and later went onto the Royal Academy Schools.\nProfessional career\nIn 1883 Smith was an apprentice to John George Gibbins in Brighton then later between 1884 and 1896 he went onto work as an assistant for a number of other architects including Frederick Mew, and to Frank (Francis) Thomas Baggallay & Walter John Nash Millard. He also travelled in France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland and before he started his independent practice in 1895. By 1895 Smith and Cecil Claude Brewer (1871\u00a0\u2013 1918) had won a limited competition for the design of a new building for the settlement in for the Passmore Edwards Settlement in Tavistock Place, London. Later in 1897 the two men had formed the Smith & Brewer partnership. Both men were members of the Art Workers' Guild. Brewer was elected in 1901 while Smith was elected in c1922. Brewer was also on the Art Workers Guild Committee from 1906 to 1907 and was one of the founding leaders of the Design and Industries Association.\nThe Passmore Edwards Settlement building established the partnership's reputation as arts and crafts architects working in the \u201cFree Style\u201d of the 1890s. The partnership designed mainly for the residential houses, such as The Fives Court, in Pinner. That was until 1909 when again they won a design competition, this time to design the National Museum of Wales building in Cathays Park, Cardiff. The conditions of competition had the following guidelines:\n\"From the position of the site on the east side of the City Hall and the relation of the Law Courts on its west side, to that building as a centre, it is thought desirable that externally the Museum building should be designed in harmony with these buildings, that, so far as possible, it may be in sympathy with the general scheme adopted.\"\nThe partnership worked with the Welsh sculptor Sir William Goscombe John (1860\u20131952) to design the sculptures that would decorate the building. They became pioneers of the Neo-Classical Revival with this building, and it played an important role in establishing the American Beaux-Arts style of classicism in the United Kingdom.\nLater in 1916 they designed Heal's furniture store in Tottenham Court Road in London (1916). After Cecil Brewer's death in 1918, Smith continued the work and he designed many residential houses as well as additions to the Fitzwilliam Museum (1924\u20131933). In 1930, Joseph Abraham Meikle (1876\u20131942) and Kenneth William Furneaux Harris (1902\u20131991) became partners under the firm name of A. Dunbar Smith. After Smith's death in 1933, Meikle, Harris and Sidney Charles Clark (1894\u20131962) continued the work under the original partnership's name of Smith and Brewer. The firm ended with the death of Clark in 1949.\nSignificant buildings by Smith & Brewer\nGrade I listed buildings\nMary Ward House, Tavistock Place, London (1899).\nNational Museum Cardiff, Cardiff (1912).\nEly House, 37 Dover Street, London.

    "\nBattle of the War of the Second Coalition\nThe Battle of Chiusella River or Battle of Romano (26 May 1800) saw part of a French Republican army led by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte attack a Habsburg Austrian division led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant (FML) Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak during the War of the Second Coalition. In May 1800, Bonaparte's Reserve Army crossed the Great St Bernard Pass into the Aosta Valley in northwestern Italy. Though its advance was delayed by Fort Bard, the Reserve Army's vanguard under GD Jean Lannes moved past the fort and captured Ivrea. Hadik attempted to block the French at the Chiusella River north of Romano Canavese. After a hard-fought action, the Austrians withdrew toward Turin. Hadik's battle report finally convinced the Austrian army commander General der Kavallerie Michael von Melas that the main French threat was coming from the Aosta Valley.\nBackground\nItalian operations\nBy the beginning of 1800, the French armies in Italy had lost all the ground that Napoleon Bonaparte had conquered in his Campaign of 1796\u201397. The French Army of Italy under GD Andr\u00e9 Massena counted only 36,000 men fit to take the field. The army held a line from Genoa to the Col de Tende while 10,000 more held the passes through the Alps.. GD Jean-de-Dieu Soult with 20,000 soldiers held Genoa, GD Louis-Gabriel Suchet defended the Col de Tende with 12,000 men, while GD Louis Marie Turreau was far to the northwest with 4,000 more at Mont Cenis.\nOn 4 April 1800, Michael von Melas launched an offensive against Genoa with 62,000 troops. Guarding the mountain passes leading into northwest Italy was FML Konrad Valentin von Kaim with 31,000 men, while there were 20,000 more soldiers in various Italian garrisons. Melas' forces also included 14,389 Piedmontese soldiers. After desperate fighting between 6 and 19 April, Melas split the French Army of Italy in two, isolating Massena and Soult in Genoa. In this two-week period, the Austrians sustained over 8,000 casualties while inflicting 7,000 losses on the French. Directing FML Peter Karl Ott von B\u00e1tork\u00e9z and 24,000 men to carry out the Siege of Genoa, Melas and FML Anton von Elsnitz with 28,000 troops drove Suchet's outnumbered corps west along the Mediterranean coast. By 11 May, Melas was in Nice and his troops reached the Var River.\nReserve Army\nBonaparte returned to France from Egypt on 9 November 1799 and immediately conspired to overthrow the unpopular French Directory. He succeeded in the Coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) and on 25 December, Bonaparte became First Consul, a position in which he exercised dictatorial power. On 25 January 1800, Bonaparte ordered GD Louis-Alexandre Berthier to create a 60,000-man Reserve Army at Dijon. To mask this from Coalition spies, various strategems were employed, so that the Austrian government did not appreciate that the Reserve Army was a real threat to its operations in Italy.\nBerthier was appointed Commander-in-chief of the Reserve Army with GD Pierre Dupont as Chief of staff. The army's Chief of Artillery was General of Brigade (GB) Auguste de Marmont who commanded 48 guns. The initial organization of the Reserve Army was as follows.\nBonaparte intended for the Reserve Army to march to Geneva and use the Great St Bernard Pass to enter northwestern Italy. Chabran's division would use the Little St Bernard Pass and join the army at Aosta. Turreau would advance from Mont Cenis and a token force would use the Simplon Pass. By agreement, GD Jean Victor Marie Moreau, the army commander in Germany, was supposed to send GD Claude Lecourbe's corps across the Gotthard Pass. On 13 May 1800, Moreau informed Bonaparte that he could only spare GD Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey leading a smaller corps. Ultimately, Moncey brought 11,500 soldiers into northern Italy.\nFort Bard overlooks the road passing along the Aosta Valley.\nEarly on 15 May 1800, he Reserve Army started from Martigny to cross the Great St Bernard Pass. By 16 May, Lannes' Vanguard occupied Aosta after a skirmish with its Austrian defenders and was joined by Chabran's division. By 17 May, the French had 12,300 infantry, 1,400 cavalry, and 14 artillery pieces in the Aosta Valley. The following day, Lannes' Vanguard defeated six Austrian infantry companies and three guns at Ch\u00e2tillon. GD Fran\u00e7ois Watrin's division captured the town while GB Jean Rivaud's cavalry brigade harassed the retreating Austrians. The French sustained only 90 casualties while capturing 350 of their foes despite the Austrians getting some belated cavalry support. On 19 May, the French encountered Fort Bard which proved to be a formidable obstacle defended by a bristling array of cannons. Though the fort had only 350 defenders, its commander Captain Stockard di Bernkopf determined to hold the place.\nOn 21 May, the French bombarded Fort Bard with three 12-pounder guns but this had little effect. An attempt was made to storm the fort, but it failed. Lannes used difficult footpaths to get his ",
    "Intelligent personal assistant & dictation software\nALICE is an Artificial Intelligence project initiated by Microsoft Research, known as Automated Learning and Intelligence for Causation and Economics. The project focuses on leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques combined with econometrics to enhance economic decision-making processes.\nHistory\nThe primary goal of ALICE is to measure causation in economic systems, which is crucial for making informed policy decisions. This involves understanding the reasons behind the movements within complex economies. The project builds on Microsoft's long history of integrating Economics and Computer Science, bringing together researchers from various fields such as Social Science, AI, and Machine Learning. The ALICE team aims to scale up the adaptation of existing ML technologies for economic applications and develop new deep learning architectures for causal inference. Their research addresses practical policy-relevant applications, including demand estimation, price optimization, effectiveness of advertising, sales strategies, and designing incentives for desirable healthcare and education outcomes. This endeavor aims to democratize economic research using AI, while simultaneously advancing the frontier of AI through economic theory.\nOne notable aspect of the ALICE project is the collaboration with TripAdvisor. A case study between Microsoft Research and TripAdvisor explored the use of causal AI for customer segmentation, This partnership emerged from a chance encounter between data scientists from both organizations, leading to a joint effort in understanding the impact of a membership model on user engagement. By leveraging an A/B test, the ALICE team developed a new statistical method to measure the direct effects of membership on engagement. This approach, which builds upon traditional instrumental variables techniques, revealed significant variation in user engagement based on the platform used and pages visited by the user.\nThe collaboration resulted in valuable insights for TripAdvisor. The ALICE team found that membership positively affects user engagement, with significant variation among users. The major drivers of this variation included the platform from which the user accessed TripAdvisor and the pages they visited before the experiment. The key innovation was developing an ML-based method for estimating heterogeneous causal effects in A/B tests with non-compliance, which allows for complex individual-level differences in both compliance and the intervention's effect.\nThe methodology has been implemented in the EconML software package, an open-source Python library developed by the ALICE team. EconML applies machine learning techniques to estimate individualized causal responses from observational or experimental data.\nPrincipal Economist Eleanor Dillon currently leads the ALICE project at the Microsoft Research Lab - New England.\n",
    "\nThe Blue Peter: The Magazine of Sea Travel was a British sea travel magazine that ran from 1921 to 1939, when it was succeeded (or, perhaps, subsumed) by The trident, incorporating Blue Peter\u00a0: a magazine of the sea, which ran to September 1957.\nHistory\nBlue Peter: A Magazine of Sea Travel (later subtitled, 'The Magazine of Sea Travel') was named for given to the nautical signal flag that represents the letter \u201cP\u201d, which, \"hoisted at the foremast-head of a ship in port, is the signal for all persons concerned to repair on board, as  is about to proceed to sea\" It was published by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O) to promote P&O and its shipping companies and served as a kind of \"nautical ... in-flight magazine\" provided gratis to passengers on ships. When not on a P&O boat, the magazine was sold for 1s, and annual subscriptions of 12 issues (post paid) could be had for 13s. 6d.\nThe magazine published artwork, non-fiction and historical articles, poems, fiction, travel stories, book reviews, maps, correspondence, and advertisements. Charles Dixon, Jack Spurling, Frank Henry Mason and other maritime painters and illustrators featured on the magazine's cover. By 1923, it was possible to purchase prints of the covers for 1 shilling and 6 pence. The Scottish author Richard Curle wrote a number of essays about Joseph Conrad for The Blue Peter, which, in October 1923, published \"A Clipper Ship I Knew\" by Joseph Conrad and, in October 1925, \"Joseph Conrad's diary (hitherto unpublished) of his journey up the valley of the Congo in 1890.\" It also published Jessie (Joseph's wife) Conrad's \"Our Visit to Poland in 1914\" in August and September 1925. Other regular contributors included the historian Basil Lubbock, the novelist Louis Golding, Walter George Bell, and John Scott Hughes. \nNotes\n^ A note in early editions of the magazine obliquely explained its purpose as an advertisement: \"This publication is intended to serve as the official magazine of a group of shipping companies, whose identity the reader will readily discover. Its further aim will be, in outline or in detail, as the occasion may demand, to place before the travelling public some account of the manifold aspects of the important world-travel system over which, now that war conditions are passing away, the ships of the grouped companies are plying once more, in the service of itinerant mankind, his mails and merchandise.\" See:\"The Blue Peter\".

    "Espionage against Peru by Soviet intelligence agencies\nThe following activities were or are supposed to have been carried out by the Committee for State Security (KGB) in Peru.\nGovernment of Juan Velasco Alvarado\nFollowing the 1968 coup d'\u00e9tat, Nikolai Leonov was sent to Lima to investigate the new regime, staying in a hotel under the cover of a correspondent from RIA Novosti. While in Lima, he made contact with some members of the regime; although the CIA alerted its local contacts of his presence, which led to him being threatened by telephone and a photographer following him. While in Lima, he had difficulties communicating with the KGB to send his reports, which meant that, on one occasion in early 1969, he had to travel to Chile to send an encrypted telegram from the KGB residence there.\nIn August 1969, after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Peru in February of the same year, a KGB residence directed by Arseni Fyodorovich Orlov was established in Lima.\nThrough the residence, the KGB established contact with various members of the regime who became \"confidential contacts\", among them the \"most trusted confidant\" of Juan Velasco Alvarado. In addition, contact was established with Velasco through another member of the regime and one of his advisors was recruited as a KGB agent. This advisor was paid US$5,000, according to a 1971 report, and through him the KGB exerted influence on Velasco and other members of government, while public opinion was formed through him, as he owned two government newspapers.\nKGB\u2013SIN relations\nIn addition to establishing contact with members of the regime, the KGB proposed cooperation with the National Intelligence Service (SIN). For this purpose, the SIN was assigned the code name KONTORA and negotiations were established between the SIN and the KGB, from which a draft agreement was produced where the exchange of intelligence, cooperation between both agencies, the training by the KGB of SIN members and the provision to the SIN of a KGB \"operational technical team.\" In June 1971, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union approved the agreement. As part of the agreement, two operations officers and a technical specialist arrived in Lima to serve as liaison with the SIN. On the other hand, the SIN stopped monitoring the KGB. Meetings between KGB and SIN officers took place once a week in SIN apartments.\nOne of the first operations between both agencies was the establishment, by the SIN and with the support of the KGB, of a surveillance post near the U.S. embassy. In addition to taking photographs and recording activities at the embassy in files, the SIN received equipment from the KGB to record telephone calls and intercept radio messages. These operations allowed \"the neutralisation of a network of US agents in the  unions and the liquidation of a technical operational group of US intelligence.\" From the operations between both agencies, various officials related to the CIA were expelled and the English courses sponsored by the US were reduced, in addition to the activities of the Peace Corps.\nIn 1973, General Enrique Gallegos Venero, leader of the SIN, visited Moscow, where he spoke with Yuri Andropov and senior KGB officials. At this meeting, it was agreed to expand the scope of intelligence cooperation to include Peruvian military intelligence, which was designated with the code name SHTAB.\nInitially, KGB officers noted \"cautious\" treatment of them by SIN members. Despite this, the KGB managed to convince them through intelligence articles, gifts, \"material aid\" and invitations to the USSR. The KGB subsequently criticised the behaviour of SIN officers who were invited to Moscow. According to a KGB report, \"the Peruvians who studied in the special departments  dedicated themselves to establishing contact with girls and women of relaxed behavior in Moscow, and maintaining intimate relations with them, after which they were handed over to another group of students to maintain intimate relationships. The students did not pay attention to the course supervisors' attempts to enlighten them.\"\nRelations with Peruvian communists\nOrlov reported to the KGB that the government was adopting a \"progressive and anti-imperialist line\" with the support of the Communist Party, which was allowed to operate openly and publish its newspaper.\nDue to the Sino-Soviet split, the KGB carried out operations against the Maoists, including those in Peru. As part of these operations, in June 1975, the KGB established contact with a leader of the Marxist\u2013Leninist Party, who operated under the code name VANTAN. Through VANTAN, the KGB disrupted the party congress in 1976 where VANTAN \"harshly criticized Beijing's policy, including its dividing line of the communist and labour movement, and decided to break with Maoism and dissolve.\"\nGovernment of Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez\nAfter the 1975 coup d'\u00e9tat, during which Velasco was overthrown by Francisco Moral",
    "2015 book by John Marenbon\nPagans and Philosophers: The Problem of Paganism from Augustine to Leibniz is a 2015 book by the British philosopher John Marenbon. It is about the treatment of pre-Christian thought among Christian writers and theologians from late antiquity to the early 18th century. The author labels his subject as the \"problem of paganism\" during the \"Long Middle Ages\".\nSummary\nPagans and Philosophers covers what John Marenbon calls the \"Long Middle Ages\", spanning from the 5th to early 18th centuries. Marenbon calls his method \"historical synthesis\", which is about tracing the handling of a perceived problem from the past, rather than looking for past solutions to a current problem. The book is about how Christians received and treated pre-Christian material, notably that of Aristotle, Cato the Elder and indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Christian material the book looks at includes theological writings, travelogues and poetry. The main areas of discussion were virtue, leading to the conception of the virtuous pagan, knowledge, leading to discussions about the merits of ancient wisdom, and salvation, including the implication that people who lived before the revelation of Jesus or never were reached by Christian teachings must be condemned to Hell. Marenbon coins the term \"the problem of paganism\" as a collective name for these discussions.\nThere are three main sections in Pagans and Philosophers. The first is about the emergence of the problem of paganism in late antiquity, with focus on Augustine of Hippo and Boethius. The second part is about the period from the Carolingian Renaissance to the 15th century, covering a disparate body of literature that includes discussions on pagan knowledge and how it relates to knowledge of God, how Christian charity distinguishes Christian and pagan virtue, and conflicting views of whether pagans could be saved. The third section addresses contacts with non-Christian populations outside of the Old World and how the previously developed views continued through Christian humanism and Protestantism.\nReception\nPrinceton University Press published Pagans and Philosophers on 22 March 2015. Lionel Wickham reviewed the book in The Journal of Ecclesiastical History, calling it \"erudite, informative, stimulating and interesting to read\". Alfonso Herreros Besa wrote in Medievalista that the subject gives justification to Marenbon's conception of the Long Middle Ages. He wrote that the breadth of the study makes the book suitable both as a resource for scholars and an introduction to the intellectual history of grace.\nSee also\nChristianity and paganism\n",
    "Public educational institution school in Senegal\nThe Prytan\u00e9e militaire de Saint-Louis is a Senegalese secondary school under the Ministry of Armed Forces, located in Saint-Louis.\nIt admits the best students in Senegal, selected through a highly competitive exam held nationwide. Annually, 50 students are chosen from over 3000, all being boys. Additionally, about fifteen students from foreign countries are also admitted. It is regarded as the best school in Senegal.\nHistory\nThe School for Enlisted Children of Saint-Louis-du-S\u00e9n\u00e9gal was established in 1923 and welcomed its first students the following year at the Oudeoud camp (El Hadj Omar camp) in the Pointe Nord neighborhood of Saint-Louis. The school's mission was to meet the needs of French West Africa by providing intellectually and technically trained cadres. Recruitment was open to the sons of active military personnel, canton chiefs, and other notable figures.\nStudents received primary education leading to the Primary School Certificate and then to advanced primary education (1st and 2nd year). After this training, students joined the platoon of the 1st Senegalese Tirailleurs Regiment. In 1926, a specific platoon for the school was created.\nThe living conditions for the Enlisted Children were rather Spartan: fed with ordinary African meals, they slept on low beds with mats and a blanket. Their attire included a fez, a red flannel belt, and they were unshod. Non-commissioned officers maintained strict military discipline.\nIn 1938, the School for Enlisted Children was attached to the out-of-rank company (C.H.R) and placed under the authority of the Officer commanding this unit. The school was later placed under the command of Captain Charles N'Tchor\u00e9r\u00e9. His tenure left a lasting impact, and his influence and legend continue to inhabit the school.\nFrom 1940, education was provided on-site: four classes were created and established within the school (2nd year elementary, 1st and 2nd year middle school, 1st year upper school). Teachers were seconded to the school alongside military instructors. The teaching staff included a director of studies and a college of teachers. In 1944, an additional class was added: the 2nd year upper school. The school's command was now entrusted to an officer solely dedicated to this role. Among the teachers was Mamadou Dia, a former Prime Minister of Senegal.\nIn 1946, the school was transferred to the Dakhar Bango camp, which was renamed Camp D\u00c9 Momar Gary on 22 December 1992, after Captain D\u00c9 Momar Gary, a former student of the school in 1946.\nFrom 1949, primary classes were gradually phased out and replaced by middle school classes (6th, 5th, 4th, and 3rd grades). In 1953, the school presented students for the first time for the Secondary School Certificate (B.E.P.C). The school changed its status and name to the African Preparatory Military School (E.M.P.A.) Charles N'Tchor\u00e9r\u00e9, with the motto: \"United, always serving France-Africa.\"\nIn June 1973, the school was renamed for the second time: the African Preparatory Military School (E.M.P.A.) became the Prytan\u00e9e militaire Charles N'Tchor\u00e9r\u00e9 de Saint-Louis (PMS). The Prytan\u00e9e militaire Charles N'Tchor\u00e9r\u00e9 de Saint-Louis was led by a Senegalese officer for the first time in 1974, Commandant Papa Assane Mbodj.\nIn 1994 and 1995, the Prytan\u00e9e militaire de Saint-Louis won the international G\u00e9nies en herbe competition.\nSee also\nRelated articles\nCharles N'Tchor\u00e9r\u00e9\nHistory of Senegal\n",
    "Plaid Cymru frontbench team in the Senedd (2023\u2013present)\nRhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid Cymru, formed his frontbench team of party spokespeople in the Senedd on 27 June 2023 after he was elected unopposed to succeed Adam Price as party leader on 16 June. He reshuffled his frontbench team on 6 June 2024 to prepare for the next Senedd election following the passage of a motion of no confidence in First Minister Vaughan Gething.\nHistory\nRhun ap Iorwerth formed his frontbench team on 27 June 2023. Delyth Jewell was appointed the new spokesperson for climate change and deputy leader of Plaid Cymru. Heledd Fychan was given a prominent role as the Plaid Cymru Group's new business manager. She also became the spokesperson for education, Welsh language and culture. Outgoing acting leader Llyr Gruffydd returned to the chairmanship of the Plaid Cymru Group and also became the spokesperson for agriculture and rural affairs. Mabon ap Gwynfor became the group's chief whip and the spokesperson for health, social care and housing. Other appointments included Peredur Owen Griffiths as spokesperson for finance and local government, Adam Price as spokesperson for justice and European affairs, Sioned Williams as spokesperson for social justice and social services and Luke Fletcher as Spokesperson for the Economy.\nOn the formation of his frontbench team in June 2023, ap Iorwerth continued Plaid Cymru's co-operation agreement with Welsh Labour. As part of the agreement, he appointed members of the Plaid Cymru Group in the Senedd to serve as \"designated members\" who spoke on issues included in the agreement and co-ordinated with the First Minister and members of their government to implement its agreed policies. Under ap Iorwerth, Si\u00e2n Gwenllian was the group's lead designated member while Cefin Campbell served simply as a designated member. In May 2024, ap Iorwerth terminated the co-operation agreement with Labour over concerns around the activities of First Minister Vaughan Gething and his government, who was found to have accepted a \u00a3200,000 donation from a company owned by a former convict for his Welsh Labour leadership campaign in March 2024 and sacked Hannah Blythyn from his government in May after she was accused of leaking private government text messages to the media.\nThe termination of Plaid's co-operation agreement with Labour left it with an effective minority in the Senedd and introduced the risk of a motion of no confidence in Gething's premiership. Later in May, the Welsh Conservatives tabled a non-biding motion of no confidence in Gething as first minister which was backed by Plaid Cymru and Welsh Liberal Democrat MS Jane Dodds. The motion was voted on in the Senedd on 5 June which Gething lost by two votes after two Labour MSs abstained. Following the confidence vote, ap Iorwerth reshuffled his frontbench team to prepare for the next Senedd election, which must be held no later than 7 May 2026. He appointed himself as Plaid's new constitution and international affairs spokesperson. Other changes included the addition of transport to Peredur Owen Griffiths' portfolio in place of his previous responsibility for finance, which was given to Heledd Fychan in place of her education brief, which was given to Cefin Campbell. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian became the new spokesperson for housing and planning and Sioned Williams' portfolio was reorganised into responsibility for social justice and early years.

    "Historical neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York with a large Mohawk population\nLittle Caughnawaga is a historical neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York with a large population Kahnawake Mohawks, as well as those from Akwesasne and other Haudenosaunee peoples, many of whom were members of the Brooklyn Local 361 Ironworkers\u2019 Union who were known as the Mohawk skywalkers and their families. During the mid-20th century, an area of ten square blocks north of the Gowanus Canal contained the largest Mohawk settlement beyond the borders of Canada. The neighborhood is now called Boerum Hill or North Gowanus. In the 1950s there were as many as 700 Mohawk people living in Little Caughnawaga.\nIn the 1920s Indigenous people from Kahnawake began moving into this section of Brooklyn. This was during a time when New York City was transforming   and skyscrapers and bridges were being built. A community gathering place for these ironworkers included the Doray Tavern, informally known as the Wigwam (now called Hank's Bar or Saloon). It was located on Nevins Street between State Street and Atlantic Avenue. An alternative name for the neighborhood was Downtown Caughnawaga. The reason why Mohawks moved to the area is because the Brooklyn Local 361 of the Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Ironworker\u2019s Union was located nearby on Atlantic Avenue between Third and Fourth avenues. While the men worked as ironworkers, the Mohawk women of Little Caughnawaga had jobs as housekeepers as well as holding positions at local factories, for example, the Fred Goat Company metal-stamping plant at the corner of Third Avenue and Dean Street.\nSome of the community members would attend the Cuyler Presbyterian Church, which was located at Pacific Street between Hoyt and Bond. During the 1940s and early 1950s, the pastor, David M. Cory (who was non-Indigenous) gave his sermons in the Mohawk language.\nIn the media\nIn 2005, a film was made by Reaghan Tarbell, titled Little Caughnawaga, about the neighborhood and the Indigenous people of Canada who lived there.  Tarbell expanded upon the topic in her 2008 film, To Brooklyn and Back: A Mohawk Journey.\nIn 2021, Building Brooklyn: Like Coming Home\nSeason 4, Episode 1 was produced that featured the stories of the women of Little Caughnawaga who helped establish the neighborhood community.\n",
    "\nJusto Pastor Rom\u00e1n Garr\u00e1n Moso (1867\u20131942) was a Spanish Catholic lawyer, publisher and politician, related to Valladolid and Navarre. He owned and managed a local vallisoletano newspaper, Diario Regional (1908\u20131926). In terms of ideology he was closest to Traditionalism. In terms of politics Garr\u00e1n approached various right-wing currents, in-between maurismo, Integrism, corporativist Christian Democracy, primoderiverismo and Francoism, yet he was most associated with Carlism. His career climaxed during two terms in the Cortes (1919\u20131920, 1923); he was also member of the primoderiverista quasi-parliament, Asamblea Nacional Consultiva (1928\u20131930). He served in the Navarrese self-government, Diputaci\u00f3n Foral (1928\u20131930), and was member of the republican Tribunal de Garant\u00edas Constitucionales (1933\u20131936). Garr\u00e1n was also the author of few theoretical treaties, dedicated to Church-state relations and to separate Basque-Navarrese legal establishments.\nFamily and youth\nmother\nThe Garr\u00e1ns have been for generations related to Valladolid. Justo's great-grandfather, Nemesio Garr\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, was regidor of the city, where he represented \"artes y oficios\"; in the Napoleonic period he voiced against resistance and advocated loyalty to \u201crey D. Jos\u00e9 Napoleon I\". Justo's grandfather, Esteban Garr\u00e1n Vitores (1797 -1865), was \"propietario fabricante de sombreros\" and in the 1830s also served as regidor. Justo's father, Mauricio Garr\u00e1n Rom\u00e1n (1827\u20131898), graduated as engineer; initially posted to Tarragona, he briefly worked as jefe of Obras P\u00fablicas in Pamplona and Burgos, until in the mid-1860s he assumed the same role in Barcelona. For some 10 years he was heavily involved in development of its harbor infrastructure and until today he is considered one of key people in its history. In the mid-1880s he moved to Ministerio de Ultramar and then Ministerio de Fomento, in the Caminos, Canales y Puertos section; he also published some works on engineering.\nDuring his service in Navarre, Garr\u00e1n Rom\u00e1n married Josefa Mar\u00eda Micaela Moso Navarlaz (1831\u20131921) from Olite. Her ancestors belonged to hidalguia related to Tafalla; the Navarlaz owned more land than the Moso. Her father, Juan Moso Villanueva, \u201ctesorero de rentas\u201d, acquired prestigious status when following death of her mother he remarried with descendant to Conde de Espoz y Mina. Mauricio Garr\u00e1n Rom\u00e1n and Micaela Moso Navarlaz will have 4 children; apart from Justo also Mauricio, Mar\u00eda and Josefa. In line with professional assignments of Mauricio the family soon moved to Barcelona, where the young Justo spent his childhood and adolescence; he obtained bachillerato in Ciudad Condal, before they moved to Madrid. In the mid-1880s he enrolled in law at Universidad Central and was an excellent student. Garr\u00e1n Moso graduated in 1891, with his thesis titled La divisi\u00f3n de poderes. El poder moderador. The same year he was admitted to Colegio de Abogados de Madrid. He was initially employed in the law firm of Germ\u00e1n Gamazo (in some sources \"despacho Maura-Gamazo\") before returning to Valladolid to open his own office.\nson Mauricio\nIn 1900 Justo Garr\u00e1n married a Pamplonesa, Catalina Moso Subiza (1870-1925). Both were fairly closely related as they had the same grandfather, Juan Moso Villanueva; Justo was his descendant from the first marriage, and Catalina from the second one. Her father, II. Conde de Espoz y Mina, was a prestigious Navarrese aristocrat and served as diputado foral in the mid-1870s. The couple settled in Valladolid, where Justo practiced and owned urban real estates, inherited from his father, though from his maternal ancestors he inherited also some rural estate in Olite. Justo and Catalina had 3 children, born between 1901 and 1912: Mauricio, Mar\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 Garr\u00e1n Moso. Both sons engaged in Carlism and served as requet\u00e9s during the civil war. Jos\u00e9 became a well-known Navarrese politician of early Francoism; he served as alcalde of Pamplona (1940\u20131941) and FET leader and civil governor of Biscay (1941\u20131942). None of Justo's grandchildren from Garr\u00e1n Arraiza, Huarte Garr\u00e1n and Garr\u00e1n Sagarra families became a public figure.\nEarly public engagements (until 1919)\nValladolid, turn of the centuries\nGarr\u00e1n's ascendants were associated with Liberalism. His paternal grandfather commanded liberal militia during the First Carlist War, while his father was \u201cun alfonsino declarado\u201d; his maternal grandfather was related to the iconic liberal Espoz y Mina family. However, the young Justo did not follow suit. Already during his academic period he co-signed letters which protested alleged anti-religious governmental policy and were published in the Integrist (1885) or Catholic (1888) papers. Following death of his father, Garr\u00e1n burnt his liberal books. In the 1890s he engaged in local Catholic organisations and emerged as their prominent member; in 1901 in name of Uni\u00f3n de Cat\u00f3licos de Valladolid he was signing various declarations.

Both the Vega and Utrera families were awarded the National Prize for Arts and Sciences in the Popular Arts and Traditions category.\nBiography\nVega learned to play by accompanying his father Mario Vega Per\u00e9z and taking his instruments to learn and play, as well as listening to other older musicians. In 1950, at the age of 18, he arrived at Boca de San Miguel before marrying his wife Hermelinda Hern\u00e1ndez Vel\u00e1zquez. Apart from being a musician, he dedicated himself to many other jobs, he was a muleteer, a sailor on the commercial boat in Tlacotalpan, a farmer and a charcoal seller. Since 1980, he was part of Mono Blanco along with his sons Jos\u00e9 Tereso and Octavio.\nFandango\nAs a musician, Vega learned, organized and attended many fandangos in Saltabarranca, Villa Lerdo, Tlacotalpan. Also, as part of his presentations, he directed fandangos throughout Mexico and in the United States.\nMono Blanco\nIn 1980, Vega attended a festival in Tlacotalpan with his son Tereso and, playing together with the Casarines, they won the contest. Two days later, the three winning groups went to Xalapa for an interview for television and Gilberto Guti\u00e9rrez, who led the group. Some time later, Guti\u00e9rrez went to look for Vega at his house to offer him to be the one to play the son guitar in the group, in which the latter accepted. Together with the group he toured various countries such as England, Spain, Morocco, Malaysia, India, France, North Korea, Cuba, Canada, El Salvador, Portugal, Venezuela, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, China, Japan and United States multiple times, playing at festivals and working with the communities of Mexican origin. On 30 October 2017, Vega accompanied the group in the celebration of its 40 years at the Teatro de Bellas Artes, this being his last concert with the group.\nDeath\nVega died on 9 May 2024, at the age of 93.\nLegacy\nThe government of the state of Veracruz created the \"Andr\u00e9s Vega Delf\u00edn\" Medal, which constitutes recognition of the traditional musicians of the region, which is awarded annually at the \"Fiesta de La Candelaria\" in Tlacotalpan, Veracruz.\nDiscography\nWith Mono Blanco\nSones Jarochos Volumen V - Grupo Mono Blanco - Ediciones Pentagrama CD, \u00c1lbum M\u00e9xico (1997)\nEl mundo se va a acabar - Grupo Mono Blanco y Stone Lips - CD (1997)\nAl Primer Canto Del Gallo - Grupo Mono Blanco Ediciones Pentagrama CD, \u00c1lbum, M\u00e9xico (2004)\nSoneros Jarochos - Grupo Mono Blanco Arhoolie Records CD, \u00c1lbum US (2006)\nMatanga.

    "American real estate investor\nLeo Francis Corrigan (August 30, 1894 \u2013 June 12, 1975) was an American real estate investor and developer, who was described as the country's largest landlord. He reportedly owned more commercial property than any other individual in the United States in the early 1970s.\nBiography\nCorrigan was the second oldest of eight children. He was born into a poor family that lived in a \"St. Louis slum\". He went to grammar school in St. Louis, came to Dallas in 1910 and sold classified advertising for the Dallas Dispatch. In 1917, one of his clients, a real estate investor, offered him a job leasing office space downtown. He soon struck out on his own, buying and building on a vacant lot at the corner of Lemmon Avenue and Wycliff Street. Corrigan began buying, leasing and reinvesting in suburban shopping areas, and soon expanded into buying and building hotels and apartments. Corrigan secured leases from merchants and used them as collateral to finance his developments, as he had little capital of his own. His holdings included the Sinclair Building in Fort Worth, the Stoneleigh, Maple Terrace, Thomas Building and Stevens Park Apartments in Dallas, and several apartment buildings in Houston and Shreveport. He and Leland Fiske were involved in one of the largest real estate transactions in history, the purchase of what was then the world's largest apartment complex in Washington, D.C., along with two other developments. Corrigan purchased a majority interest in the Adolphus Hotel in 1948. Corrigan is said to have made several unsuccessful attempts to buy the Empire State Building. He bought the Tower Petroleum Building in 1943. He also owned the Corrigan Tower, 211 North Ervay, and other office buildings in Dallas. Corrigan also developed the Hong Kong Hilton and the Emerald Beach in Nassau. For a time he also owned the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. Carrigan married Catherine Redman in 1917 and they had two children, Louise and Leo Francis Jr. He and his wife donated to Southern Methodist University and Austin College to endow chairs in real estate. Corrigan's grandchildren continue to run Corrigan Properties and Corrigan Investments.\n",
    "Screensaver for Roku\nRoku City is the name given to a screensaver present on Roku streaming devices. The looping background depicts a virtual metropolis at night, colored by hues of magenta and blue.\nBackground\nThe screensaver depicts a slowly looping city street in the foreground, composed of businesses, a diner, a movie theater, and a city hall. Across a body of water in the background sits a silhouette of skyscrapers and buildings, with unusual amounts of chaos: volcanoes, a spaceship, a robot monster, and more. The complimentary color scheme is prominently composed of pink and purple hues. The scene changes with the seasons; in the autumn months, trees change colors. The illustration contains easter eggs of various films and characters, including King Kong andThe Wizard of Oz, and more.\nThe illustrations were created by Kyle Jones, a freelance graphic artist, who took inspiration from art deco architecture to design the city. The name of the background known internally at Roku was City Scroll: Movie Magic, and it debuted in 2018.\nAdvertising\nIt slowly began adding advertising to the city through branded partnerships in 2023, including with McDonald's, Paramount+, and Disney. Roku built a real life, pop-up display of Roku City for the 2023 SXSW festival.\nReception\nAs Roku became a popular player in the streaming space, the ubiquity of Roku City gave rise to semi-ironic fascination among users, and it became the focus of memes. Olivia Craighead of Gawker wrote: \"Roku City haunts me. What would it be like to live in such a place, where there is peace in one borough while just a river away there is mass hysteria and a giant robot is terrorizing the masses.\" Roku's internal team observed an uptick in attention at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when most people stayed home and nightlife was nonexistent.\nIts widespread usage has been considered unprecedented. Luke Winkie at The New York Times wrote: \"Roku has become the unlikely venue for a massive public art experiment. Due to the size of the company\u2019s customer base, countless homes peer into Roku City every weeknight.\"\n",
    "\nFormer Italian bank\nThe Societ\u00e0 generale di credito mobiliare italiano (lit.\u2009'General Company of Italian Financial Credit'), often referred to simply as Credito Mobiliare, was a major Italian bank in the last third of the 19th century. \nIt was established in 1863 in Turin with support from the Pereire brothers, succeeding a previous venture, the Cassa del Commercio e dell'Industria di Torino (lit.\u2009'Bank of Trade and Industry of Turin'), which had been founded in 1852 and had been supported by the French Rothschilds in the late 1850s. \nThe Credito Mobiliare failed to survive the major Italian financial crisis of the early 1890s and was liquidated in 1893. Some of its operations were re-organized as the Banca Commerciale Italiana, marking the transition from French to German influence in Italian investment banking.\nHistory\nThe Cassa del Commercio e dell'Industria di Torino was established in 1852 and reorganized in 1856 with support from Paris-based financier James Mayer de Rothschild, who wanted to pre-empt efforts by his French competitors the Pereire brothers to expand on the Italian market. That effort, however, did not succeed. The Cassa was again restructured in 1860, and once again in 1863 when it was renamed Credito Mobiliare. The latter transaction was executed with the support of the Pereire-controlled Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier, and as a consequence, half of the equity belonged to the previous shareholders of the Cassa and the other half to stakeholders of the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier, including the Pereires themselves.:\u200a90\u200a The newly rebranded bank was immediately listed on the stock exchange. \nDuring the panic of 1866, the Credito Mobiliare underwent a bank run but avoided failure thanks to the support of the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier and of the National Bank of the Sardinian States. Following that experience, Domenico Balduino, the bank's general manager since the 1860 restructuring, pivoted towards investment banking, making the Credito Mobiliare the dominant player on that market in the following two decades, financing numerous industrial and infrastructure ventures and helping them sell securities. \nFollowing Balduino's death in 1885, Giacinto Frascara became the Credito Mobiliare's general manager. As the bank had become overexposed to the construction sector, Frascara attempted to mitigate the risk by purchasing deposit banks and other financial institutions, including the Milan-based Banca di Credito Italiano in 1892. This did not prevent the Credito Mobiliare from being placed in liquidation in 1893, with the newly created Bank of Italy assuming some of its losses.\nSee also\nBanca Generale\nBanco di Sconto e Sete\nBanca di Credito Italiano\nNotes\n^ Maffeo Pantaleoni (1998), La caduta della Societ\u00e0 Generale di Credito Mobiliare Italiano, Bancaria\n^ Leonardo Giani (2008), \"Ownership and control of Italian banks: A short inquiry into the roots of the current context\" (PDF), Corporate Ownership & Control (6(1)): 87\u201398\n^ \"Banca di Credito Italiano Soc.

    "Municipal building in Falmouth, Cornwall, England\nThe Palacio Lounge is a former municipal building on The Moor in Falmouth, Cornwall, a town in England. The structure, which currently operates as a restaurant and bar, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe elected corporation of Falmouth was based at what is now the Old Town Hall until the mid-1860s. They then decided that they required larger premises, and so commissioned a new building on The Moor. The site they selected, on the corner of Webber Street and Killigrew Street, was formerly occupied by Allen's Brewery.\nConstruction work on the new building began in 1864. It was designed by Charles Reeves and Lewis George Butcher in the Italianate style, built by Olver & Sons in rubble masonry with a stucco finish at a cost of \u00a34,000, and was completed in 1866. It was also used as a courthouse, and contained a county court office, registrar's office, high bailiff's office and apartments for judges.  In 1895, the building was extended to the northwest, with the new section serving as a fire station. However, in 1896, the corporation moved to new premises in the Municipal Buildings.\nThe building continued to serve as the local magistrates' court until 1990. It was then converted into the Rumours nightclub, shortly thereafter, with modifications which were later described as \"not particularly sympathetic\".  In 2015, it was restored at a cost of \u00a3600,000 and converted into a restaurant and bar named the Palacio Lounge.\nThe Palacio Lounge featured in the novel, Troubled Blood, in the Cormoran Strike series, written by J. K. Rowling and published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith in 2020. Scenes for the television adaptation of the same book were filmed there and released as Strike Series 5 Troubled Blood in 2022.\nArchitecture\nThe design involves a main frontage which is five bays wide and almost symmetrical, except that the rightmost bay is wider to incorporate the main entrance, designed to be viewed from Killigrew Street.  The curved doorway is flanked by Tuscan columns and has a royal coat of arms in the cornice above. The ground floor is rusticated. The central section of three bays, which is slightly projected forward and features a squat attic storey, contains, at ground floor level, a segmental headed window with voussoirs and a keystone in the middle bay, and segmental headed doorways with voussoirs and keystones in the bays on either side. On the first floor, the central section is fenestrated by round headed windows with keystones and ogee-shaped hood moulds and, on the attic floor, it is fenestrated by small rectangular windows. The two-storey end bays are fenestrated by segmental headed windows on both floors. At roof level, the central section is surmounted by eaves supported by brackets, while the end bays are surmounted by modillioned cornices. The fire station section is also five bays wide and fenestrated in a similar style.\nInternally, some original features survive, including many of the windows, a cantilevered stone staircase, and a canopy in the old magistrates' court. The building was grade II listed in 1973.\n",
    "2023 novel by Dolly Alderton\nGood Material is a 2023 romantic comedy novel by British author Dolly Alderton. The novel follows Andy, a 35-year-old struggling comedian who is blindsided when his girlfriend of almost four years, Jen, unexpectedly ends their relationship. The story explores Andy's attempts to cope with and understand the breakup, while navigating the challenges of dating and maintaining friendships in his thirties. Good Material has been praised for its wit, insight, and ability to capture the complexities of modern relationships.\nPlot\nAndy Dawson, a 35-year-old struggling comedian in London, navigates the aftermath of his unexpected breakup with his girlfriend of nearly four years, Jen Hammersmith. Blindsided by Jen's decision to end their relationship with little explanation, Andy becomes consumed with understanding her reasons, believing that uncovering the truth might help him win her back. As he grapples with his emotions, Andy engages in self-destructive behaviours, excessively drinking and obsessively monitoring Jen's social media presence.\nIn the wake of the breakup, Andy moves out of the apartment he shared with Jen, briefly staying with his mother and then his best friend Avi and Avi's wife Jane, who is also Jen's best friend, before finding a new place with Morris, an elderly conspiracy theorist. Seeking support from Avi and Jane, Andy attempts to gather information about his ex-girlfriend while simultaneously struggling with feelings of loneliness and personal failure. Despite his friends' efforts to be there for him, Andy feels like a burden and avoids openly discussing his pain.\nAndy's attempts to distract himself from his heartbreak, including a short-lived stay on a houseboat and hiring a personal trainer, prove ineffective. His obsession intensifies when he discovers that Jen has started dating a new man, leading him to fixate on her boyfriend's social media presence. Alongside his personal struggles, Andy's comedy career begins to suffer, punctuated by a scathing viral review that criticises his lack of effort and originality in his performances.  He enters into a brief relationship with a 23-year-old woman named Sophie, though he ultimately ends the relationship upon realising her feelings for him are stronger than his feelings for her.\nAndy and Jen reconnect at the birthday party of Avi and Jane's son and end up spending the night together. The following morning, Andy realises that their relationship is truly over, prompting him to reassess his life and begin the process of moving on. Andy starts to revamp his comedy routine, incorporating his breakup into his material. The new, more authentic approach resonates with audiences, and he receives positive feedback, including from Jen herself.\nIn the novel's final pages, the narrative shifts to Jen's perspective, offering insight into her side of the story. She reveals that her relationship with Andy was challenging due to his emotional struggles and lack of ambition. Although the breakup was extraordinarily difficult for her as well, Jen believes that being single is the best decision for her personal growth. The book concludes with Jen planning a year-long tour of South America in 2020, fulfilling a long-held dream, while Andy prepares to perform his new show at The Fringe Festival in Edinburgh that summer.\nThemes\nA significant theme in the novel is the exploration of heartbreak and modern relationships. The protagonist, Andy, struggles to accept the end of his relationship with Jen, leading him to engage in various self-destructive behaviours such as drinking before noon, cyber-stalking Jen, and entering a morally dubious relationship with a much younger woman. The novel delves into the complexities of these coping mechanisms and Andy's journey towards closure. Friendship and support are highlighted as crucial elements during difficult times. The novel addresses the challenges men face in expressing their emotions and seeking help from friends.\nStyle\nGood Material is primarily written in the perspective of the male protagonist Andy, but in the final pages of the novel, Alderton employs a narrative shift, giving Jen a voice and allowing her to share her side of the story.\nBackground\nAlderton started writing Good Material in 2020, in the wake of a painful breakup. To authentically capture the male experience of heartbreak and relationships, Alderton conducted extensive research, interviewing around 15 men of various ages, backgrounds, and personality types. Through these interviews, Alderton discovered a common theme: men often felt they lacked the language or permission to discuss their emotions in detail with their male friends. \"They told her that when they spoke to their friends about their break-ups, 'they felt they were boring them. Some of them said they could talk for a while but eventually they would worry they weren't being entertaining enough or that their dignity was compromised.'\"\nAlderton's decision to write from",
    "\nFrank Rockwell Comfort was a competitive swimmer for Syracuse University and the head swim coach for the University of North Carolina from 1977 to 2007 where he led the Tarheels to 349 dual meet wins.   Combined with his prior wins coaching Johns Hopkins University, in 2004 he reached 578 dual meet wins, a number that uniquely distinguished him as the coach with the most wins in collegiate swimming history.  In the year before beginning his long service as coach for North Carolina, he led the Johns Hopkins Swim team to a 1977 NCAA National Championship.  Comfort coached 8 Olympic participants, four women, and four men, primarily at the University of North Carolina.\nEarly life and swimming\nComfort was born on December 20, 1945, to Robert and Francis Meck Comfort, an educator, and Syracuse University graduate, and grew up in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. His father taught business administration as a Professor at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania. His mother served as the chief librarian at Harrisburg Area Community College.   Swimming for Harrisburg, he qualified for the Pennsylvania State Swimming Meet in March 1963, by placing fourth in the 200-yard freestyle, and third in the 400-yard freestyle at the Eastern Regional Meet.  Comfort also swam for Colonial Crest Swim Club of Harrisburg during his High School years and in July 1963 broke pool records in the 100 freestyle and butterfly events.  In July, 1964 in the summer after his High School Senior year, swimming for West Shore Swim Club, he won two events, the 100-meter backstroke, and the 100-meter butterfly in a time of 53.1 at a Tri-County Swim League Meet.\nCollege era swimming and coaching\nHe graduated Syracuse University with a Bachelor's in History in 1968, where he was a three-year letterman in swimming from 1964 to 1967.  In competition he excelled in middle distance events and occasionally swam the 500 freestyle.  As a Syracuse college upperclassman in 1967, he also coached the Syracuse Jewish Community Center swim team, which had a wide range of age group swimmers.  He received his Masters in Physical Education from Carolina in 1968, and coached their Freshman swimming team to a perfect 7\u20130 record as well as assisting with the Varsity team as a Student Coach.\nCoaching Johns Hopkins\nBefore assuming the position as head coach at Carolina, between 1968 and 1977 Comfort served as the head swimming and diving coach at NCAA Division III Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md. In nine seasons, the team achieved a record of 82\u201336 in dual meets. Comfort led the Hopkins's Blue Jays to 8 Mid-American Conference (MAC) Championships, 4 Mason-Dixon Championships, two NCAA Runner-up finishes and most notably the 1977 NCAA Team Championship. While coaching at Hopkins, he also served as Director of Physical Education, Assistant Track Coach, and the Director of the Summer Athletic Program.\nIn his career with Hopkins, he produced 159 All-Americans, 22 individual national champions in individual events and one relay national champion during his nine-year tenure at Baltimore. He coached the Johns Hopkins women in their first two seasons to a 12\u20135 record and back-to-back MAC Championships, and was the first coach for the women's program.  Upon leaving Hopkins in 1977, Comfort was replaced by Assistant Coach Tim Welsh. Comfort had also coached the Homewood AAU Aquatic club during his tenure at Hopkins, and had mentored nationally rated swimmers with the Homewood Aquatic team, Teresa Hecht, Nancy Thompson, 1976 Olympic medalist Wendy Weinberg, and Ellen Mangels.\nCoaching University of North Carolina\nIn the 30 years between May, 1977 and July, 2007, where he replaced Jim Wood as Head Coach, Comfort had an exceptional winning career at North Carolina. He led the university to 26 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championships, consisting of 10 men's teams championships, and 16 women's team's championships. Comfort\u2019s women\u2019s team at Carolina finished in the NCAA's top 10 five times.  Nearing the end of his tenure with the tarheels, by January 2003 he had won 500 dual meets and had achieved an exceptional career record of 501\u2013146\u20131.  Comfort remarked in 2003, that \"Getting the 500th is a great tribute to a lot of great swimmers and divers who've competed for me at Johns Hopkins and Carolina over the past 35 years\".\nComfort always noted that he stressed education first and swimming second.   He required a minimum of three morning and six afternoon practices, rather than many programs that required five or six morning practices.  He also established an Alumni Club for his swimmers to help build team loyalty and improve recruiting by creating a network of graduates who could look for top talent in their communities.\nThe swimmers and divers under Comfort's management won both at North Carolina and previously at Johns Hopkins University with a frequency and consistency unparalleled by any former swimming coach. Of his 565 career wins, 303 came while coaching men and 262 whi",

    "Tolkien scholar\nElizabeth Whittingham is a former lecturer in English at the State University of New York College, Brockport, New York. She is known for her Tolkien studies research, including her 2008 book The Evolution of Tolkien's Mythology, which examines his legendarium as published in the 12-volume The History of Middle-earth.\nLife\nElizabeth Whittingham is the daughter of Thomas Whittingham and his wife Dorothy M. McEwen, who was chair of nursing at Roberts Wesleyan College. She was a lecturer in English at the State University of New York College, Brockport, New York, and at Monroe Community College, Rochester, New York. She has contributed to The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia. She retired from teaching early in the 2020s.\nTolkien studies\nWhittingham wrote one of the first scholarly studies of Christopher Tolkien's 12-volume The History of Middle-earth (1983\u20131996), in her 2008 book The Evolution of Tolkien's Mythology, based on her PhD thesis. She contributed a chapter on Unfinished Tales and The History of Middle-earth to the 2014 Wiley-Blackwell A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien, and a chapter on Tolkien's music and songs to the 2019 book Music in Tolkien's Work and Beyond, from which she has been quoted as stating that music is \"the most powerful force in Tolkien's universe\".\nReception\nDeidre Dawson, reviewing The Evolution of Tolkien's Mythology in Tolkien Studies, noted that it was one of the first books on Christopher Tolkien's 12-volume work, barring studies such as those by Verlyn Flieger and Tom Shippey. She finds the analysis of theology and comparative mythology \"quite dense\", showing an \"impressive\" command of both the legendarium and Tolkien's ancient sources, and finds \"convincing\" the argument for the growing importance of \"Judeo-Christian theology\" in Tolkien's writings. She disagrees, however, with Whittingham's claim that his struggles with the legendarium's original flat world cosmology showed that \"his mythology was not relevant to people of a modern, scientific age\". On the contrary, Dawson writes, if he had failed to make his mythology relevant, there would neither be so many readers of his work, nor such a variety of researchers studying it.\nB. N. Wolfe, reviewing the book for the Oxford C. S. Lewis Society, writes that it does much that should assist other scholars, and is \"serious scholarship in a field full of insubstantial popularizations.\" Wolfe is relieved that while Whittingham acknowledges her debt to Flieger, she does not agree with Flieger's view that \"most of Tolkien's ideas\" came from Owen Barfield. All the same, Wolfe suggests that Barfield should have been discussed. He finds interesting her analysis of Christopher Tolkien's elimination of all forms of framing of The Silmarillion as he published it. Overall, he recommends the book, forgiving its \"many\" faults since \"it is blazing a relatively new path\".\n",
    "1763 siege and occupation of Serampore\nThe British occupation of Serampore also referred to as the English occupation of Serampore (Danish: Den engelske bes\u00e6ttelse af Serampore) was a siege and thereafter a minor military occupation by the United Kingdom on the Danish trading post of Serampore (Frederiksnagore) in 1763.\nBackground\nIn 1755 the Danes got permission from Alivardi Khan to establish a trading post at the Hooghly River near Calcutta. The colony of Frederiksnagore was established as a result of this agreement. \nIn 1756, the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, wanted the Danes to assist him in the Siege of Calcutta. However, because of bad living conditions, the Danes refused to support the siege, and ud-Daulah thereafter fined the Danes 25,000 Indian rupees. Later in 1757, the English would blockade the Danish vessel King of Denmark from entering Serampore, because of the Danish hospitality to the French.\nOccupation\nA more serious incident with the British happened in 1763. Demarchis, the commander of Serampore, took office in 1762 and the British quickly took a hostile view of him. This hostility only grew bigger when some English sepoys were changed with 25 lashes each, because of their assaulting on Danish peons. As a response, a British force surrounded Serampore on 4 April and would besiege it until 15 April when the British could take over. The occupation did not last long though, and already in the same year, the British withdrew the city because of a Danish apology.\nAftermath\nAs a result, this left Serampore being a rather impoverished colony in the first two decades of its existence. Subsequently, Demarchis would be deposed from his post as commander three years later in 1766 and would return to Copenhagen.\nSee also\nCapture of Tranquebar\u00a0\u2013 Capture of Tranquebar by British forces in 1801\nCarnatic wars\u00a0\u2013 18th century wars between the French and the British\nGondalpara\u00a0\u2013 City/town in West Bengal, IndiaPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nDano-Mughal War\u00a0\u2013 Danish colonial conflict against the Mughal Empire\n",

She was a member of the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) during the time of the Second Spanish Republic, led the Joventuts Llibert\u00e0ries de Catalunya\u00a0 (JLC) during the Spanish Civil War, and joined the Uni\u00f3 de Joventuts Antifeixistes\u00a0 (UJA) to resist the Spanish State. She died from tuberculosis, aggravated by wounds inflicted by torture, in Les Corts prison\u00a0. \nBiography\nJulia Romera Y\u00e1\u00f1ez was the daughter of miner Francisco Romera Rodr\u00edguez and Matilde Y\u00e1\u00f1ez P\u00e9rez. In 1918, as a result of the influenza pandemic, her parents died within three days of each other. Mar\u00eda, her older sister, was left in the care of her maternal grandparents in Cartagena and Julia remained with her paternal grandparents in Mazarr\u00f3n. In 1921, Murcia was in the middle of an economic crisis; mine closures, persistent drought and widespread unemployment caused a massive emigration to industrialised areas. The Romera family decided to emigrate to Santa Coloma de Gramenet, a town outside Barcelona. In 1930, at the age of 14, Julia started working as a weaver in Can Bar\u00f3, where many of the workers were affiliated to the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT).\nIn 1931, following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, the CNT, which had been underground during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, was legalised and reorganised. The Joventuts Llibert\u00e0ries de Catalunya\u00a0 (JLC) was established soon after. Romera joined the JLC around 1934-35 and soon became a leading figure. Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, in July 1936, most of the young people volunteered to go to the front and Romera was appointed secretary general, a position she combined with that of treasurer; she also collaborated with International Red Aid (MOPR) and worked as editor-in-chief of the magazine Aurora Libre. On 27 January 1939, the Army of Africa occupied Santa Coloma. Many Republicans went into exile, but Romera at the time was caring for her ailing grandmother, and despite the advice of her colleagues, she decided to stay behind.\nBy May 1939, Romera had joined the Uni\u00f3 de Joventuts Antifeixistes\u00a0 (UJA), a group of young anti-fascists that attempted to carry out guerrilla warfare against the Spanish State. They were discovered and, on 30 May 1939, many of their members were arrested. They were found in possession of a typewriter, five rifles, three rifles and ammunition. Romera was taken to the Civil Guard headquarters where she was held incommunicado. For three days she was interrogated, tortured and humiliated, but she made no confession. On 2 June, unable to walk, disfigured and with her belly swollen from internal injuries, she was transferred to the Cervantes Theatre in Badalona, which had been converted into a prison, and was subsequently remanded in custody in the Les Corts prison\u00a0 in Barcelona.\nOn 2 January 1940, the court-martial of the UJA was held, in which twenty-five people (three of them minors) were tried. The prosecutor asked for the death penalty for Romera, but she was finally sentenced to life imprisonment. When Romera entered Les Corts, there were 1,400 inmates, food was scarce and living conditions were harsh. She shared a cell with Conxita Vives and the actress Maruja Tom\u00e1s\u00a0. At the end of the summer of 1941, after suffering from recurrent fevers, the prison doctor diagnosed her with advanced tuberculosis, aggravated by the serious internal injuries she had suffered as a result of torture and poor living conditions. She was admitted to the prison infirmary and died on 6 September at 22:00, having refused the spiritual help offered by the prison priest. Romera's companions raised some money so that she could have a proper funeral.\nHistorical memory and recognition\nStreet sign of Carrer de Julia Romera Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\nIn 2002, as a culmination of neighbourhood petitions, an Ateneo Popular named after Romera was inaugurated in Santa Coloma de Gramanet. In 2016, an exhibition and a tribute to Julia Romera Y\u00e1\u00f1ez was organised by the Jos\u00e9 Berruezo history group. In 2017, as part of the actions to recover the historical memory of Santa Coloma de Gramanet, the Francoist name of the Passatge de la Vict\u00f2ria was changed to Carrer de la Julia Romera Y\u00e1\u00f1ez. The plaque reads \"Lluitadora per la llibertat\" (English: \"Fighter for freedom\").\n",

    "Indigenous ethnic group of Brunei\nEthnic group\nThe Dusun people of Brunei, also known as Sang Jati or Suang Jati, are an indigenous ethnic group primarily residing in the Tutong and Belait Districts of Brunei. They constitute one of the seven indigenous ethnic groups in Brunei Darussalam, known locally as the Sang Jati Dusun.\nThe Brunei Dusun ethnic group is closely related to the Bisaya ethnic group of Limbang, with a strong presence in Tutong district and scattered communities in Belait. Their cultural richness, distinct traditions and linguistic diversity significantly contribute to Brunei's cultural heritage.\nEtymology\nDusun\nThe term \"Dusun\" has a complex and multifaceted etymology, reflecting historical, cultural, and linguistic influences. The word Dusun is a Malay term that literally means \"people of the orchards.\" It was originally used to refer to groups of people living in the inland regions of North Borneo. In the context of the Dusuns in Brunei, their contact with coastal Malays led to the imposition of the \"Dusun\" ethnic label. This designation was primarily due to their inland residence, which was surrounded by fruit orchards and coconut plantations, and their occupation as rice farmers and fruit growers.\nOriginally an exonym given by the Bruneian Malays. Over time, it became an official term used by both the Brunei Sultanate and the colonial administration to refer to various indigenous communities in the region.\nSang Jati\nThe Dusun people, also known as \"Sang Jati\" in their own endonym, have a distinct understanding of their identity. In the Bruneian Dusun language, sang means tribe or ethnic group, and jati means \"ours\" or \"us.\" The Dusun community in Brunei refers to themselves as Sang Jati rather than the Dusun tribe, a term originally associated with their traditional farming practices of rice cultivation and fruit farming. Despite its origins, the Sang Jati community embraces the name Dusun with pride.\nThe term \"Sang Jati\" gained prominence in the 1960s with the establishment of the Pakatan Sang Jati Dusun association, marking a significant moment in the reclamation of their identity. Before this, the Dusun people were known by various names, reflecting regional and contextual variations. The adoption of \"Sang Jati\" signified a unified and empowered identity for the community.\nOther names\nBefore the widespread use of \"Dusun\", outsiders commonly referred to the Dusun people as \"Bisaya\" or \"Orang Bukit\" (the Hill People).  These terms were prevalent until the early 20th century and were used interchangeably to denote the Dusun communities.\nHowever, because the Dusuns demonstrated some similarities with other ethnic groups in the country, particularly the Bisayas, the Belaits, and the Tutongs, the term \"Dusun\" was inevitably used interchangeably with the terms Kedayan, Dusun Tutong, Iddeh Kitah, Sang Kedayan, Idahan, Bisaya, Tutong and Belait. These names and terms are used to refer to the Brunei Dusun as communities having similar 'cultural stock' or linguistically very closely related to each other.\nThese diverse names for the Dusuns led to some ambiguity, which was clarified by the Constitution of Brunei in 1959 and later by the passing of the Nationality Law in 1961. The Nationality Law offers an authoritative classification that defines the Dusuns, the Tutongs, the Bisayas and the Belaits as four of the seven separate ethnic groups.\nSettlements\nThe Dusun population in Brunei primarily inhabits the Tutong and Belait Districts. Although precise statistics are challenging to ascertain, estimates indicate that the majority of the Dusun reside in the Tutong District, with significant populations in villages such as Bukit Sawat, Sungai Mau, Merangking, Ukong, Kiudang, Lamunin, and Rambai. Smaller numbers are also found in the interior of the Brunei Muara District.\nDusun settlements are spread across various regions in Brunei:\nCoastal Settlements: Danau, Telisai, Sungai Liang, and Lumut.\nLowland Settlements: Located along the Tutong river valley in villages such as Sungai Damit, Ukong, Rambai, and others.\nUpland Settlements: Situated in the Tutong and Belait Districts, including Bukit Udal, Long Mayan, Merimbun, Merangking, Bukit Sawat, and Sukang.\nHistory\nEarly history\nThe history of the Dusun people is deeply rooted in their settlements across the highland and lowland areas of Brunei, spanning centuries of tradition and cultural evolution. Traditionally, Dusun society was structured around compact nucleated settlements, creating close-knit communities that fostered strong kinship ties and intermarriages within the group. This communal way of life was integral to their identity and played a vital role in shaping their social structure.\nDuring the era of Brunei Sultanate rule, which dates back centuries, the societal dynamics of the Dusun people began to undergo gradual transformations. Bilateral kin groups, led by respected male elders known as tatuwo, formed the foundation of their egalita",
    "For other uses, see John Campbell (disambiguation).\nJohn Campbell (abt. 1720\u20131776) is credited for founding Campbelltown, Pennsylvania. He was part of the wave of Scotch-Irish immigrants who voyaged to the New World in the 1700s. These immigrants, mostly of Scottish origin, were lured to the New World by a promise of cheap land and a fresh start.\nPersonal Life and Family\nJohn Campbell was born in Ireland to James Campbell Sr. sometime around 1720. John's great-great grandfather, Duncan Campbell, was born in Inverary, Argyllshire, Scotland and moved to Londonderry County in 1612 where he later had three grandchildren named Dugald, John and Robert. John's branch of the family emigrated from Ireland in 1726 along with his son James and two grandsons John and Patrick to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where settled in the area then known as Derry Township in Lancaster County, named so after his homeland. James owned a large plantation in modern-day Hershey, Pennsylvania and left it to his grandson James Campbell Jr. and would be divided if his son John were to ever have a surviving male child.\nDuncan Campbell was \"of the noble house of Breadalbane\" and was the great-great grandson of Archibald Campbell, the 3rd Lord of Auchinbreck and Kilmichael and the great-grandson of Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell.\nCampbell was of Scotch-Irish descent, a group of immigrants who were originally from Scotland and had settled in Ireland before moving to the New World by a promise of cheap land and a fresh start. Scotch-Irish immigrants began arriving in droves starting in 1718 after they had faced discrimination in Ireland along with skyrocketing rents. They were also politically minded, and became involved in local governments quickly after settling in the area.\nCampbelltown\nFurther information: Campbelltown, Pennsylvania\nJohn Campbell seemed to be in the business of buying, selling, and renting properties, especially in his later years. Campbell, a farmer, was given one of the largest tracts of land (352 acres) in the area. He initially obtained a warrant for 100 acres from Thomas and Richard Penn, proprietors of the Province of Pennsylvania in 1752 and sons of the famous William Penn. After returning his survey, he purchased an additional 252 acres and patented it on August 6, 1759. Campbell had then laid out various lots subject to the ground rent system for his new town which he called \"Campble's Town.\"\nThe town was subsequently sold to Peter Grubb for \u00a37,000 in 1779, who presumably finished laying off the parcels, and renamed it to \"Campbelltown.\"\nLater Life and Death\nOn 7 May 1761, Thomas Willing, a merchant of Philadelphia, executed a transaction with Campbell. The property, located on Swatara Creek, was conveyed to Campbell for the sum of \u00a3200. This deed was officially recorded on 5 November 1761.\nJohn Campbell died intestate before April 3, 1776, at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. His wife, Margaret (surname unknown), sold her interest in the estate to John's brother, Patrick.The said John Campbell did afterwards lay out part of the first above described Patented tract for a town or village and divided the said part into lots and granted and confirmed the same lots of ground unto sundry persons subject to the payment of a yearly ground rent\u2026 And whereas, the said John Campbell soon after died intestate and without issue.\nLegacy\nCoat of Arms of Clan Campbell\nThe names of the Townships of Derry and Londonderry are used interchangeably at a time when Londonderry was split from Derry in 1767. Today's Derry Township, Londonderry Township, North Londonderry Township, and South Londonderry Township all originated from the original Derry Township in Lancaster County. These areas were named after Londonderry County in Ireland, the homeland of John Campbell's family.\nThe 'coat of arms' for the Clan Campbell of Argyll, Scotland was used in the design of the shoulder patch of the South Londonderry Township Police Department, highlighting the area's connection to Campbell and his Scottish heritage.The Latin words 'Ne Obliviscaris' scrolled above the helmet were original to the Campbell coat of arms. Its meaning is 'Forget not'. The helmet signifies protection and security in defense; The two lions in red depict strength and courage; The two objects in black and yellow are called Gyronnys. They stand for Unity (and are also the main objects in the Campbell families from both Ireland and Scotland).\nFamily Tree\n",

She has published widely in her field.\nShe became an alternate member of the group of independent experts for the European Charter of Local Self-Government in 2007 and was promoted to full membership in 2013.\nPolitician\nJerini\u0107 became politically active with the Do not let Belgrade drown (NDB) movement, serving on its legal team. At NDB's nomination, she was a deputy member of the Belgrade election commission for the 2018 Belgrade City Assembly election.\nNDB contested the 2022 Serbian parliamentary election as part of the We Must (Moramo) coalition. Jerini\u0107 was given the seventh position on the coalition's electoral list and was elected when the list won ten mandates. The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its allies won the election and afterward formed a coalition government with smaller parties; NDB served in opposition. In her first assembly term, Jerini\u0107 was the deputy chair of the judiciary committee, a member of the committee on the rights of the child, a deputy member of the European integration committee and the committee on human and minority rights and gender equality, and a member of Serbia's parliamentary friendship groups with Albania, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Japan, Jordan, the Netherlands, Slovenia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.\nIn July 2023, NDB joined with four local citizens' groups to create the Green\u2013Left Front (ZLF).

Jerini\u0107 appeared the twentieth position on the coalition's list and was re-elected when the list won sixty-five mandates. The SNS and its allies won a majority victory, and the ZLF remains in opposition.

She appeared in the fourth position on the We Choose New Belgrade opposition coalition list in the New Belgrade city municipality and was elected when the list, according to the official preliminary results, won nine seats. The SNS and its allies, according to the same results, won a narrow majority victory.

The club is playing its home matches at the 11,000-capacity Kon Tum Stadium. They currently play in the Vietnamese Second Division, after finishing top of their group in the Vietnamese Third Division during the 2023 season.\nHistory\nEarly years and first dissolution\nThe forerunner of Kon Tum was the Gia Lai - Kon Tum football team, founded in 1976. Despite being an amateur team, the team also once won the A2 championship, the second  highest division of the country. The incarnation of the Kon Tum Football Club came into being in 1992 when the club was split into Gia Lai FC and Kon Tum FC.\nFrom its establishment until 1999, Kon Tum competed in the National A2 League, the second division of the country. In 2000, when the football league system in Vietnam was reorganized, Kon Tum played in the Second Division (third tier) from 2000 to 2004 before being relegated to the Third Division. From 2005 to 2013, Kon Tum was playing in the fourth tier of the country but failed to gain a promotion due to the club's limited financial condition. The turning point was in the 2013 season when Kon Tum surpass regional rivals L\u00e2m \u0110\u1ed3ng and ranked first in their group, thus returning to the  a promotion to the Second Division after 10 years.\nIn the first season back in the Second Division, Kon Tum continued to performed well and ranked second in their group and qualified to the promotion play-off game. However, the team lost with a score of 0\u20134 to B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc and missed the chance to promote to the V.League 2.\nIn the following season, Kon Tum finished at the bottom of the group and got relegated. On 25 December 2015, the executive committee of the Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) announced the dissolution the of Kon Tum Football Club due to the lack of fund to the club.\nReformation, second dissolution and second reformation\nIn 2016, Kon Tum club returned and competed in the Vietnamese Third Division. They ranked second in their group and promoted to the 2017 Second Division. They remained in the league until 2022 where Kon Tum suffered a relegation to the Third Division. After the unsuccessful season, the club dissolved for the second time.\nA new Kon Tum FC was created, being named V\u1ecb Tr\u00ed V\u00e0ng Kon Tum for sponsorship reasons. The club competed in the 2023 Vietnamese Third Division and finished first of their group, thus making their return the Second Division. Following the promotion, the club changed its name back to the current Kon Tum FC.\nCoaching staff\nCurrent squad\nAs of 30 March 2024\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

    "\nMain article: Prehistory of Colorado\nMap of Fremont County, Colorado. The Arkansas River, one of the longest rivers in the United States, crosses through the center of the county. In southwestern Fremont county, the river is just north of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The altitude of the river descends as it moves east to the plains in eastern Fremont County. North of the river are the Front Range mountains.\nEarly history of Fremont County, Colorado includes Native Americans, such as the Ute people, and later the establishment of the Colorado Territory by European explorers and settlers. \nPaleo-Indians came into the Arkansas River Valley of Fremont County, Colorado more than 10,000 years ago and left evidence of their being there. About 700 years ago, Ute people passed through and inhabited the Ca\u00f1on City area for centuries. A favored area was Temple Canyon along Grape Creek. Plains tribes, like the Arapaho, Comanche, Kiowa, and Cheyenne, and Pueblo people also hunted in the area. As European American settlers established themselves, the Utes continued to come to the area and had a peaceful existence with its residents. After 1863, the Ute were pushed to the Western Slope and then onto Ute Mountain Indian Reservation in southwestern Colorado in the Four Corners region and the Southern Ute Indian Reservation in southern Colorado.\nIn 1540, explorer Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado claimed the area for Spain. Zebulon Pike explored the Arkansas River area in Colorado in 1806. Part of the Stephen H. Long's Expedition of 1820, included travel from the Canadian River to the Arkansas River. John C. Fr\u00e9mont, whom the county is named after, traveled the Arkansas River area in 1844. On a survey expedition for a railroad in 1848, Fr\u00e9mont traveled to Hardscrabble Creek (near Hardscrabble), Mosca Pass over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, to the San Luis Valley.\nThe Fort Le Duc trading post was established in the 1830s. From 1844 to 1845, a trading post, an early farming settlement, and cattle ranch supported 70 people at Hardscrabble. European Americans moved into Fremont County in 1859 during the Pike's Peak gold rush.\nNative peoples\nPaleo-Indians\nStarting more than 10,000 years ago, Paleo-Indians (11,500 to 7,500 years ago) camped in the present-day Ca\u00f1on City area in Fremont County.:\u200a30\u200a Evidence of Paleo-Indians habitation includes fire pits, animal bones, and stone tools, generally projectile points used in hunting. Archaeological sites in Fremont County, particularly around Ca\u00f1on City, held evidence of Native American habitation, including portable skin tents, wooden articles, hearths, and evidence of stone tool manufacturing. Four Fremont County wilderness areas\u2014Lower Grape Creek, Upper Grape Creek, McIntyre Hills, portions of Beaver Creek\u2014were studied for archaeological evidence of prehistoric life with negligible findings.:\u200a19\u201323\u200a\nUte people\nCharles Craig, Uncompahgre Ute Indian Camp, 1893, Denver Art Museum\nUte people spent time seasonally in the area 700 years before Europeans appeared. They favored the mountains and visited the Arkansas Valley area during seasonal treks to the plains. Utes hunted buffalo, visited the Soda Springs, and camped nearby. They drank the spring water for its healing properties. One of the city's parks, Temple Canyon, about 30 by 70 feet (9.1 by 21.3\u00a0m), would have been accessed after a hike along Grape Creek. A legend states that Blackfeet and Ute warriors fought at the canyon to marry a maiden. It is reportedly the site of a battle between U.S. soldiers and Ute people.:\u200a58\u200a\nChief Ouray\nThe Tabeguache band of the Uncompahgre Utes, including Chief Ouray and Chipeta, spent the winters at Ca\u00f1on City due to its hot springs and mild weather.:\u200a12,\u200a104\u200a Dakota Hot Springs are located between Ca\u00f1on City and Penrose. Hot springs are considered sacred to the Utes. As Ca\u00f1on City was settled, Utes continued to come to the area where they camped. They were on good terms with the settlers. Ute chief Colorow was a friend of Otto Morganstein, the first settler of Red Canyon Park, north of Ca\u00f1on City.:\u200a59\u200a Ouray had dinners with local residents and was a friend of Richard Houle of Red Canyon.\nPlains and Pueblo people\nSanta Fe Trail and native tribal lands in 1845. The Santa Fe Trail paralleled the Arkansas River for much of its route through southern Colorado. It became the dividing line between the Comanche and Kiowa, south of the river, and the Cheyenne and Arapaho north of the river.:\u200a47\u201356\u200a The Cheyenne had a winter camp on along the Arkansas River on Mountain Route of the Santa Fe called Big Timbers\nPlains cultures\u2014including Arapaho, Comanche, Kiowa, and Cheyenne people\u2014visited and hunted the area, as did Pueblo people. By the mid-1600s, the Arapaho left the Great Lakes region for the Great Plains. They moved west and met up with the Cheyenne, who left the Great Lakes area later than the Arapaho, in the Black Hills. The tribes, whose languages were Algonquian languages, developed an alliance an",
    "\nPKS 0226-559 known as PMN J0228-5546 is a quasar located in the constellation Horologium. At the redshift of 2.464, the object is roughly 10.6\u00a0billion light-years from Earth.\nCharacteristics\nPKS 0226-559 contains a flat-spectrum radio source found brighter than S4.8\u00a0GHz=65 mJy. It is classified as a blazar, a type of powerful extragalactic object shooting out an astrophysical jet towards Earth's direction with a jet axis of \u227220\u00b0 with strong variability across electro-magnetic spectrum. Such blazars like PKS 0226-559 have a rapid broad-band flux density and polarisation variability, with fast superluminal motion, and a high degree of polarisation. There are two classifications based on the presence of emission lines. The first classification are BL Lacertae objects with weak or emission lines absent. The second classification are flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) with strong emission lines, whom PKS 0226-559 belongs to.\nThe quasar is known to have a non-thermal emission in which from the jets, accessible bands of the electromagnetic spectrum can been seen, right up to high energy (HE; >100 MeV) and very high energy reaching up to (VHE; >100 MeV) in \u03b3-ray bands. The broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) in PKS 0226-559 shows two broad humps features, in which the synchrotron peak frequency (\u03bd S peak) in PKS 0226-559 is positioned between 1012.5 and 1014.5 Hz.\nAccording to observations conducted from the Large Area Telescope, one of the instruments has found that PKS 0226-559 shows an increasing gamma-ray emission from a source. It is believed that the accretion of matter is responsible for powering emission into the supermassive black hole in PKS 0226\u2013559.\nPKS 0226-559 has a power-law index of p = 1.56 \u00b1 0.064; this signifies a flux variation, which in the 0.3\u201310 keV band, the weakest sources tend to exhibit fluxes on the order of (1.06 \u00b1 0.32) \u00d7 10\u221213 erg\u2009cm\u22122s\u22121, while the brighter source reaches up to (2.96 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10\u221211 erg\u2009cm\u22122s\u22121, while majority of the sources exhibits a soft photon index.\nThe bolometric luminosity of PKS 0226-559 is found to exceed 1048 erg\u2009s\u22121 with \u03b3-ray flux ranging between 4.84 \u00d7 10\u221210 to 1.50 \u00d7 10\u22127 photon cm-2 s-1. This allows it to be observed even located at very high redshift. Distant blazars like PKS 0226\u2013559, are particularly interesting, as since the study offers insights how supermassive black holes form and evolve overtime, as well as proving insight to relativistic jets, and the connections between accretion discs and jets. Moreover, their \u03b3-ray emission is important for probing the early universe given \u03b3-ray emission from distant blazars undergoes attenuation via \u03b3\u03b3 absorption when they interact with extragalactic background light (EBL) photons, that enables observations constraining the EBL's density.\n",
    "1997 studio album by T-Model Ford\nPee-Wee Get My Gun is the debut album by the American musician T-Model Ford, released in 1997. Ford was 75 years old when the album was released. He supported it by touring with labelmate R. L. Burnside; the dates represented the first time Ford had performed outside of Mississippi.\nProduction\nFord wrote all of the album's songs, although he was not shy about lifting ideas from other songwriters. He was backed by his drummer, Tommy Lee \"Spam\" Miles. Frank Frost played keyboards on some of the tracks, despite the fact that he did not get along with Ford and had to be goaded by coproducer Matthew Johnson to participate in the recording sessions. The producers decided to keep Ford's mistakes, which included bad tunings and coughing fits. Many of the songs reference the violent acts that Ford had both administered and received.\nCritical reception\nGuitar Player opined that \"T-Model's ravaged voice and harrowing guitar attack are quite literally stunning.\" The Santa Fe New Mexican praised the \"demented songs of love and violence and human endurance.\" CMJ New Music Monthly concluded that \"this is the timeless blues, so alive and mysterious that it could have been recorded 60 years ago or 60 minutes ago.\"\nThe Chicago Tribune listed Pee-Wee Get My Gun as the third best blues album of 1997. The Commercial Appeal listed it as the fifth best album of the year. Newsday also considered the album to be among the best of 1997, writing that \"there's little fancy fretwork in 76-year-old Ford's debut album, but that doesn't dilute the potency of his primitive grooves.\" The Rocket noted the \"grind-in-the-grease, down-in-the-dirt jamming.\"\nAllMusic said that the music \"can be hypnotic or tedious, depending upon your taste.\" In 1999, Rolling Stone deemed Pee-Wee Get My Gun \"a creditable batch of backwoods grooves.\"\nTrack listing\n\"Cut You Loose\"\n\"T-Model Theme Song\"\n\"Been a Long Time\"\n\"Turkey and the Rabbit\"\n\"Can't Be Touched\"\n\"Nobody Gets Me Down\"\n\"I'm Insane\"\n\"Where You Been\"\n\"Feels So Bad\"\n\"Sugar Farm\"\n\"Let Me In\"\n",
    "Motor car race\nThe 2024 Music City 200 was the 3rd stock car race of the 2023 ARCA Menards Series East season, and the 3rd iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, May 13, 2023, at the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway in Nashville, Tennessee, a 0.596 mile (0.959\u00a0km) permanent asphalt oval shaped short track. The race was originally scheduled to be contested over 200 laps, but was increased to 205 laps, due to a NASCAR overtime finish. In an action packed finish, Luke Fenhaus, driving for Pinnacle Racing Group, would steal the win from the dominating William Sawalich, taking the lead on the final restart and leading the final lap to earn his first career ARCA Menards Series East win. Sawalich had dominated the entire race, leading all but three laps, but eventually lost the lead on the final restart, finishing 2nd. To fill out the podium, Sean Hingorani, driving for Venturini Motorsports, would finish in 3rd, respectively. \nReport\nBackground\nNashville Fairgrounds Speedway, the circuit where the race was held.\nNashville Fairgrounds Speedway is a motorsport racetrack located at the Nashville Fairgrounds near downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The track is the second-oldest continually operating track in the United States. The track held NASCAR Grand National/Winston Cup (now NASCAR Cup Series) races from 1958 to 1984.\nThe speedway is currently an 18 degree banked paved oval. The track is 0.596\u00a0mi (0.959\u00a0km) long. Inside the larger oval is a 1\u20444\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km) paved oval.\nThe track was converted to a 1\u20442\u00a0mi (0.80\u00a0km) paved oval in 1957, when it began to be a NASCAR series track. The speedway was lengthened between the 1969 and 1970 seasons. The corners were cut down from 35 degrees to their present 18 degrees in 1972. The track was repaved between the 1995 and 1996 seasons.\nEntry list\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\nPractice\nThe first and only practice session was held on Saturday, May 13, at 2:00 PM CST, and would last for 60 minutes. William Sawalich, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, would set the fastest time in the session, with a lap of 19.683, and a speed of 109.008\u00a0mph (175.431\u00a0km/h).\nQualifying\nQualifying was held on Saturday, May 13, at 4:00 PM CST. The qualifying system used is a single-car, two-lap based system. All drivers will be on track by themselves and will have two laps to post a qualifying time. The driver who sets the fastest time in qualifying will win the pole.\nWilliam Sawalich, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, would score the pole for the race, with a lap of 19.415, and a speed of 110.512\u00a0mph (177.852\u00a0km/h).\nQualifying results\nRace results\nStandings after the race\n",
    "Genus of lichens\nCrocynia is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Ramalinaceae. It has five species. The genus is currently in taxonomic limbo because molecular studies have shown that Crocynia, which has nomenclatural priority over Phyllopsora, is phylogenetically nested within Phyllopsora. This has led to a proposal to conserve the name Phyllopsora over Crocynia to ensure nomenclatural stability and avoid taxonomic disarray.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus Crocynia was initially circumscribed by Erik Acharius in 1810 as a section within the genus Lecidea, under the name Lecidea sect. Crocynia. It was later elevated to genus rank by Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1860. The type species of the genus is Crocynia gossypina, which was originally described as Lichen gossypinus by Olof Swartz.\nPhyllopsora was described by Johannes M\u00fcller Argoviensis in 1894 to accommodate several species from New Zealand. Over time, it has become recognised as a pantropical genus, mainly occurring in moist woodlands and rainforests. The genus comprises nearly 60 species, including those indicating the types of three genera that have priority over Phyllopsora: Triclinum (1825), Symplocia (1854), and Crocynia (1860).\nRecent molecular studies have shown that Crocynia is phylogenetically nested within the genus Phyllopsora. This has led to a proposal to conserve the name Phyllopsora over Crocynia and other competing names to ensure nomenclatural stability. According to the authors of the 2019 proposal, the conservation of Phyllopsora against Crocynia and Triclinum is favoured to avoid taxonomic disarray, given that the type material for many Crocynia species has been lost, and the historical inclusion of distantly related species has caused confusion.\nCrocynia gossypina is a pantropical lichen species characterised by its byssoid (cottony) thallus, which lacks an upper cortex, making it distinctive. However, many species historically placed in Crocynia have been reassigned to other genera, such as Lepraria. The genus name Phyllopsora is widely known and used among lichenologists, particularly those working with tropical material, making it a practical choice for conservation.\nIf the proposal is accepted, the genus Crocynia will be synonymised under Phyllopsora, reflecting current phylogenetic understanding and simplifying the classification of these lichens. This change will also help maintain continuity in the scientific literature and avoid the need for extensive renaming of species.\nSpecies\nAs of June\u00a02024, Species Fungorum (via the Catalogue of Life) accept five species of Crocynia:\nCrocynia didymica Sipman (2018)\nCrocynia fragilis B.de Lesd. (1924)\nCrocynia glaucescens (F.Wilson) S.Y.Kondr., Elix & K\u00e4rnefelt (2011)\nCrocynia microphyllina Aptroot (2011)\nCrocynia minutiloba Aptroot (2014)\n",
    "\nPodcast\n200 Plus is an Australian podcast hosted by Network 10 Sport's Journalist Nick Butler and Australian Rules Football players Charlie Comben and Sam Draper. It launched on April 27, 2022, with Daniel Gorringe as a host, who in 2024 would eventually be replaced full time by Comben. In 2024 the show added former AFL player Max Lynch as guest host. The show is based around Australian Rules Football, more specifically players with the height 200\u00a0cm (6\u00a0ft 5 in) or more and features a wide array of guests, including Ivan Soldo, Mason Cox, Nick Larkey and more. 200 Plus is a part of Dylan Buckley's Clubby Sports network and is recorded at Buckley's studio space Producey in Richmond, Victoria.\nFormat\n200 Plus is released weekly across all platforms during the Australian Football League season. Each episode, spanning 45 to 90 minutes, offers insightful Australian Rules Football commentary and engaging comedic discussions. Additionally, the show occasionally treats its audience to bite-sized content with 20-minute mini-episodes titled 'Chooked' and 'Tall Tales', hosted by the charismatic Nick Butler as well as 'The Recovery' Hosted by both Butler and producer Joshua Moffit .\n200 Plus is sponsored by the Australian betting company Neds.\nCriticism\nIn April 2024, Sam Draper made a comment on the future of Western Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge saying \u201cI\u2019ve got a big call about the Doggies. If Bevo\u2019s still there, there\u2019ll be some players requesting trades,\" before affirming names - including Jack Macrae, Bailey Smith, Caleb Daniel and Bailey Dale - suggested by his co-hosts.\u00a0\nSpeaking on\u00a0the comments made by Draper, Beveridge said \"We are breaking ground all the time, aren't we? It was bizarre to me. I'm not going to say anything about it really because I think the people that became aware of it and are close to him and their football club were extremely alarmed and reached out to me and expressed their apologies. This is normally one where I\u2019m sure that he has had a think about it and maybe he wouldn\u2019t do it again, I\u2019m not sure\".\nWhen Draper's coach Brad Scott was asked about the comments, he replied \u201cHe\u2019s very, very clear how disappointed I was. He thought he was in an environment where he thought he was being funny. I said \u2018mate, it\u2019s the furthest thing from funny. It\u2019s disrespectful\u2019.\u201d \nFollowing the incident, Caroline Wilson reported on Nine Network's Footy Classified that \"Sam Draper wanted to keep doing the podcast, Essendon didn't. His management Michael Doughty intervened and said he can have a four-week spell,\". Draper eventually returned to the podcast after two weeks, denying Wilson's claims that the club wanted him to stop the podcast.\n",
    "Australian nurse (1875 \u2013 1954)\nIda Greaves RRC (1875 \u2013 1954) was the Australian Matron of the Australian Voluntary Hospital in WWI who became a member of the Royal Red Cross.\nLife\nGreaves was born in Newcastle in 1875. She trained to be a nurse at the Newcastle Hospital from 1901 to 1904. She left nursing in Australia in 1910 to work as a nurse in Britain.\nIn 1914 Rachel, Lady Dudley who was the estranged wife of a former governor-general of Australia completed her discussions with the King and Lord Kitchener. She had noticed that there were a large number of Australian doctors and nurses in Britain and war had been declared. She proposed to create a new hospital staffed by Australians. Her idea was accepted by the British Army and Australia made the official offer on 15 August and two days later advertisements appeared in the British press. Female Australian nurses and male Australian doctors could apply.\nDonated Ambulances outside the Australian Voluntary Hospital in Wimereux.\nGreaves became the hospital's matron and there were 36 nurses and, in time, a staff of 120. One of the nurses was Ida's sister Susie. The new hospital's staff left for France before the end of August. They were the only Australians on the Western Front until April 1916. By that time Greaves had already received a Royal Red Cross in recognition of her work. This was an award only given to women and she and Nora Kathleen Fletcher were the first Australians, during the war, to receive this award.\nGreaves and the other staff had arrived at Le Havre on a private yacht and the hospital was assembled at St Nazaire. It was moved to Wimereau by the end of October. It was to find its permanent home at the Hotel Golf in Wimereux. The nurses slept in tents until a house was found for them.\nGreaves later worked at the British General Hospital 12 in Rouen. When she returned to Australia she was lauded as one of the longest serving Australians in uniform during the first world war. She was called \"the senior war nurse\" and she helped raise funds for returned veterans. She opened a private hospital which they named Iluka in her home city of Newcastle.\nGreaves died in the Sydney suburb of Chatswood in 1954. In 2021 her biography, Matron Ida Greaves \u2013 'a Right Daughter of Australia', was published.\n",
    "The ability to understand, use, monitor, and critically reflect on AI applications\nAI literacy or artificial intelligence literacy, is the ability to understand, use, monitor, and critically reflect on AI applications. The term usually refers to teaching skills and knowledge to the general public, not to people who are adept in AI.\nAI literacy is necessary for school and college students. AI is employed in a variety of applications, including self-driving automobiles and Virtual assistants. Users of these tools should be able to make informed judgments. AI literacy is also likely to have an impact on pupils' future employment prospects.\nDefinitions\nOne of the common and early definitions for AI literacy was that it is \"a set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies; communicate and collaborate effectively with AI; and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace.\"\nLater definitions are the ability to understand, use, monitor, and critically reflect on AI applications, or  the ability to understand, use, evaluate, and ethically navigate AI.\nAI literacy is linked to other forms of literacy. AI literacy requires digital literacy, whereas scientific and computational literacy may inform it, and data literacy has a significant overlap with it.\nCategories\nAI literacy encompasses multiple categories, including theoretical understanding of how artificial intelligence works, the usage of artificial intelligence technologies, the critical appraisal of artificial intelligence, and its ethics.\nKnow and understand AI\nKnowledge and understanding of AI refers to a basic understanding of what artificial intelligence is and how it works. This includes familiarity with machine learning algorithms and the limitations and biases present in AI systems. Users who know and understand AI should be familiar with various technologies that use artificial intelligence, including cognitive systems, robotics and machine learning.\nUse and apply AI\nUsing and applying AI refers to the ability to use AI tools to solve problems and perform tasks such as programming and analyzing big data.\nEvaluate and create AI\nEvaluation and creation refers to the ability to critically evaluate the quality and reliability of AI systems. It also refers to designing and building fair and ethical AI systems. To evaluate correctly, users should also learn in which areas AI is strong, and in which areas it is weak.\nAI ethics\nAI ethics refers to understanding the moral implications of AI, and the making informed decisions regarding the use of AI tools. This area includes considerations such as:\nAccountability: Hold AI actors accountable for the operation of AI systems and adherence to ethical ideals.\nAccuracy: Identify and report sources of error and uncertainty in algorithms and data.\nAuditability: Enable other parties to audit and assess algorithm behavior via transparent information sharing.\nExplainability: Make sure that algorithmic judgments and the underlying data can be presented in simple language.\nFairness: Prevent biases and consider varied viewpoints. To do so, increase the diversity of researchers in the field.\nHuman Centricity and Well-being: Prioritize human well-being in AI development and deployment.\nHuman rights Alignment: Ensure that technology do not infringe internationally recognized human rights.\nInclusivity: Make AI accessible to everyone.\nProgress: Choose high value initiatives.\nResponsibility, accountability, and transparency: Foster trust via responsibility, accountability, and fairness.\nRobustness and Security: Make AI systems safe, secure, and resistant to manipulation or data breach.\nSustainability: Choose implementations that generate long-term, useful benefits.\nEnabling AI\nSupport AI by developing associated knowledge and skills such as programming and statistics.\nPromoting AI literacy\nSeveral governments have recognized the need to promote AI literacy, including among adults. Such programs have been published in the United States, China, Germany and Finland. Programs intended for the general public usually consist of short and easy to understand online study units. Programs intended for children are usually project-based. Programs for students at colleges and universities often address the specific professional needs of the student, depending on their field of study. Beyond the education system, AI literacy can also be developed in the community, for example in museums.\nSchools\nSchools use diverse pedagogies to promote AI literacy. These include:\nPerforming a Turing test with an intelligent agent\nCreating chatbots\nBuilding apps using Blockly-based programming\nProject-based learning\nBuilding robots\nData visualization\nTraining AI models\nArtificial intelligence curricula can improve students' understanding of topics such as machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning.\nCase study: DAILy\nThe DAILy (Developing AI Literacy) program was developed by MIT and Boston University with th",

    "Archaeological culture known from the Late Pleistocene -early Holocene of Western North America\nExamples of Western Stemmed Tradition projectile points\nThe Western Stemmed Tradition (WST) is a Paleoindian archaeological culture known from the Intermountain West of North America, particularly the Great Basin and the Columbian Plateau, spanning from over 13,000 years Before Present (and thus overlapping with the more well-known Clovis culture) to around 8,500 years Before Present. Unlike Clovis and related traditions, the stone projectile points produced by the Western Stemmed Tradition are unfluted (lacking flakes removed at the base). Other types of tool produced by WST peoples include stone crescents. The Western Stemmed Tradition has a wide variability in tool morphology, and is divided up into a number of chronologically separated subtypes, including Haskett (~12,600-11,500 years BP), Cougar Mountain (Great Basin, 11,700-9,000 years BP), Lind Coulee (Columbia Plateau, 12,000-11,200 years BP, named after Lind Coulee Archaeological Site) Parman (Great Basin 11,300-9,000 years BP) Silver Lake (Great Basin, 11,000-9,850 BP) and Windust (11,300-8,500 years BP, named after Windust Caves). Some of the oldest sites of the tradition are at Cooper's Ferry in Idaho (up to 16,000 years ago) and Paisley Cave in Oregon, dating to the B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d Interstadial.\nWST type points include both stemmed (those with a basal section narrower than the main body of the point) as well as lanceolate forms. The points were manufactured from a variety of core types primarily using percussion flaking, with pressure flaking also being utilized. These points were likely mutlifunctional, also serving as cutting tools and knives.\nWST-type tools are most often found around current or former lakes and wetlands, though they have also been found in other environments like deltas, caves, rockshelters and canyons.\nWST peoples are suggested to have produced textiles and rope based on finds in caves associated with WST-type tools, and are also suggested to have produced rock art, and traded with coastal peoples for marine shell beads.  Unlike the Clovis culture, which are suggested to have been specialised mobile big-game hunters, WST peoples (with perhaps the exception of the Haskett, which have lanceolate points) are suggested to have been generalists than consumed a wide range of food resources. Evidence from Paisely cave suggests that WST peoples consumed animals like pronghorn, bighorn sheep, mule deer, jackrabbits and sage grouse, as well as crickets, alongside consuming various plant foods. Find at other sites like Connley Caves in Oregon and Old River Bed in Utah suggest the hunting of bison, mule deer, rabbits, waterfowl and fish. The Buhl Woman, a woman found buried in southern Idaho with a WST-style tool, had a diet with a significant component of fish as evidenced by isotopic analysis.\n",

From 1951 to 1954, he worked as an assistant teacher in Ma\u00efn\u00e9-Soroa and Magaria. From 1955, he taught at the regional school of Birni, the historical center of Zinder. In the same year, Inn\u00e9 became the secretary-general of the Zinder section of the National Union of Teachers of Niger (SNEG) and the Zinder section of the National Union of Workers of Niger (UNTN). During the 1950s, he twice visited France for further training.\nTeaching career\nFrom 1960 to 1964, Inn\u00e9 was the director of the regional school of Birni. From 1964 to 1967, he served as a school counselor, and from 1968, he was an academy inspector for the Zinder Region. In 1966, he also took on the role of deputy mayor of Zinder. As an academy inspector, he was actively involved in establishing experimental schools. In these experimental primary schools, established in 1973, the national languages of Niger were taught in addition to the official language, French. Marcel Inn\u00e9 and Andr\u00e9 Salifou also established the theatrical tradition in the city of Zinder.\nPolitical career\nA military coup on 15 April 1974 ended the long-term presidency of Hamani Diori. Seyni Kountch\u00e9 became the new leader. Marcel Inn\u00e9 was sent to the capital, Niamey, losing his positions as a union leader, academy inspector, and deputy mayor. In 1974, the military regime appointed him head of educational television. Later, in 1978, Kountch\u00e9 appointed him the first director-general of the public television channel ORTN, a position he held until 1981. From 1981 to 1987, Inn\u00e9 was deputy director of the National Institute of Documentation, Research, and Pedagogical Animation (INDRAP). He also served as a consultant for UNESCO and the CILSS from the 1970s onwards and occasionally oversaw teacher training at the University of Niamey.\nAfter Seyni Kountch\u00e9's death in 1987, Ali Saibou succeeded him as the head of state. For Marcel Inn\u00e9, this meant another career leap. From 1987 to 1989, he was a member of the National Development Council, the highest state body, where he was responsible for training regime cadres. On 19 May 1989, Marcel Inn\u00e9 was appointed Minister of National Education, succeeding Ousmane Gaz\u00e9r\u00e9. However, he remained in office only a few months. On 20 December 1989, Mamadou Dagra became the new Minister of National Education. Inn\u00e9 retired on 1 January 1990.

    "\nThe Weaver family of North Carolina is a locally prominent Pennsylvania Dutch family that founded Weaverville along Reems Creek in North Carolina.\nOrigins\nThe progenitor of the family was an unknown linen weaver, surnamed Weber, that fled from the Holy Roman Empire to the United Provinces of the Netherlands due to religious persecution, likely because he was a member of the Reformed church. He married a Dutch woman and fathered John, Frederick, and two other sons in the Netherlands. \nJohn Weaver (1763\u20131830) was a German-Dutch settler, immigrant, and Revolutionary War veteran who came to the Province of Pennsylvania from the United Provinces in the 18th century with his 3 brothers. Eventually, John would settle in the Reems Creek valley in North Carolina, where his son, Montraville Weaver (1808\u20131882) would found the town of Weaverville.\nPer the Family Tree DNA Weaver DNA Project, the family has the Y-DNA haplogroup J-FTC77280, originating in the Balkans.\nHistory\nInitial settlement\n1899 Weaver family reunion in Weaverville, North Carolina\nJohn Weaver maintained friendly relations with the local Cherokee in the valley and built an Indigenous-style house, before purchasing 320 acres of land to construct a European log cabin as his family's permanent residence.\nSlavery and the Civil War\nJohn's son, Montraville, became a slaveholder. Despite the vast majority of Germans in the Antebellum South not using slaves and many being generally opposed to the practice, there was a minority of German slaveholders located primarily in the Shenandoah Valley and other parts of the region.\nAs a slaveholding family, many members of the Weaver family fought for the Confederacy during the American Civil War, such as Captain Elbert Weaver (1841\u20131935), who was Montraville's first son, and Private Abraham Weaver (1832\u20131913), who deserted in northern Georgia after his unit was slaughtered during Wheeler's October 1863 Raid. Abraham was the grandson of Frederick Weaver (1750\u20131839), John Weaver's brother, Revolutionary War veteran, and slaveholder in Sullivan County, Tennessee.\nWeaver College\nWeaver College, founded in 1851 as Weaverville College, was a co-educational Methodist academy located in Weaverville.

Following promotion as champions of Division Three the previous season, the club competed in Division Two, as well as the League Cup and FA Cup.\nSummary\nHereford's rapid progress up the Football League was halted as they made an immediate return to Division Three, becoming the first team ever to finish bottom of Division Two having been promoted as Third Division champions the previous season.\nAfter a promising start which saw only one point dropped in the first three matches, Hereford's form nosedived as it became clear that most other clubs possessed greater strength in depth and players more suited to the demands of Second Division football. This was amply demonstrated by successive matches in the autumn when Hereford were beaten 4\u20131 at Fulham by a team containing Bobby Moore, Rodney Marsh and George Best, then thrashed 6\u20131 at home a week later by a Wolverhampton Wanderers side containing the likes of Steve Kindon, Kenny Hibbitt, Alan Sunderland and Bobby Gould.\nA late rally (four wins and only one defeat from the final nine matches) proved to be too little, too late and relegation was confirmed following a goalless draw against Carlisle United with three matches still to play.\nSquad\nPlayers who made one appearance or more for Hereford United F.C. during the 1976-77 season\n\nSecond Division\nSource: Rules for classification: 1) Points; 2) Goal difference; 3) Goals scored(R) Relegated\nResults\nSecond Division\nMain article: 1976\u201377 Football League\nHereford United v Hull City\nSheffield United v Hereford United\nHereford United v Burnley\nNottingham Forest v Hereford United\nCarlisle United v Hereford United\nHereford United v Charlton Athletic\nFulham v Hereford United\nHereford United v Wolverhampton Wanderers\nLuton Town v Hereford United\nSouthampton v Hereford United\nHereford United v Notts County\nMillwall v Hereford United\nHereford United v Chelsea\nBristol Rovers v Hereford United\nHereford United v Oldham Athletic\nBlackburn Rovers v Hereford United\nHereford United v Bolton Wanderers\nHereford United v Orient\nCardiff City v Hereford United\nChelsea v Hereford United\nHull City v Hereford United\nHereford United v Plymouth Argyle\nBurnley v Hereford United\nBlackpool v Hereford United\nCharlton Athletic v Hereford United\nHereford United v Nottingham Forest\nHereford United v Fulham\nWolverhampton Wanderers v Hereford United\nHereford United v Luton Town\nHereford United v Sheffield United\nNotts County v Hereford United\nHereford United v Cardiff City\nPlymouth Argyle v Hereford United\nHereford United v Bristol Rovers\nOldham Athletic v Hereford United\nHereford United v Millwall\nHereford United v Blackburn Rovers\nBolton Wanderers v Hereford United\nHereford United v Carlisle United\nHereford United v Blackpool\nHereford United v Southampton\nOrient v Hereford United\n\nLeague Cup\nMain article: 1976\u201377 Football League Cup\nChester v Hereford United\nHereford United v Chester\n\nFA Cup\nMain article: 1976\u201377 FA Cup\nHereford United v Reading\nMiddlesbrough v Hereford United\n\n",
    "Gladys Stone Wright (born 1925) was an American band director. She was among the first woman band directors in the United States, and was the first one in Oregon. She is also a composer, author, music judge, and clinician. Wright won multiple awards.\nPersonal life\nWright was born in 1925 in Wasco, Oregon. Her childhood was spent in Oregon at a lumber camp, and she started to learn music when she received a year's worth of free piano lessons along with a $5 clarinet. Wright attended Lebanon High School, where she was part of the school's band and newspaper. She graduated from high school in 1943. She was educated at Willamette University for one year and then attended the University of Oregon in 1948. She received her undergraduate and master's degree from the university. Her husband was the Purdue University band director Al G. Wright.\nCareer\nWright was a high school band director at a time when it was considered unusual for a woman to be a band instructor. Many school administrators were against hiring women to conduct a band. Wright was the second woman to become a member of the American School Band Directors Association, which had 450 men as members. In Oregon, Wright conducted the band at Elmira Union High School for five years. During Wright's final year at Elmira Union, the high school's band joined the North-West Music Educators' Conference. Wright said of the conference, \"It was the only time they had had a woman director, and the clinic session was packed by male directors just to see what a woman could do.\" The male band directors applauded the performance of Elmira Union High School. She was the first woman band director in Oregon.\nShe founded the Women Band Directors National Association and was a part of the North American Congress of Bands. Wright served as a member of various band-related organizations. Wright was the first woman to be guest conductor of the United States Navy Band and the Goldman Band. Over 22 years, Wright has received \"consecutive superior ratings\" for the bands that she led. She is also a composer, author, music judge, and clinician. She has written for national magazines as well as written the compositions \"The Big Bowl March\" and \"Trumpets and Tabards\".\nAwards\nIn 1969, Wright received a citation of excellence from the National Band Association. Wright won the Tau Beta Sigma \"National Award for Service to Music\" at the University of Michigan in 1971. The award \"recognizes the contributions made by distinguished female conductors, composers, educators, administrators, artists, and clinicians\" who have helped promote bands as a \"musical art form\". In 1999, Wright was the first woman to be elected to the National Hall of Fame of Distinguished Band Conductors. Her induction ceremony was held on February 6, 1999, and the Band Conductors Hall of Fame building. On February 5 of the same year, she was the Honored Guest Conductor of the Troy State University Symphony Band.\n",

    "\nComputer programming portal\nVerse is a static typed object-oriented programming language created by Epic Games. It was released alongside UEFN in March 2023 and was authored by a team of well-known programmers led by Simon Peyton Jones, and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Verse is designed to interact with Fortnite Creative's existing \u200d\u200bdevices system. As of June 2024, UEFN remains the only way to interpret, parse, compile or run Verse code; plans to implement the language into the release of Unreal Engine 6 have been discussed.\nFeatures\nModules and importing\nVerse supports modular programming, allowing developers to import specific modules required for their scripts. Commonly used modules include the API digests that are generated every time a project containing verse is opened. There is an API digest to access and interact with Fortnite objects, Verse objects, and Unreal Engine objects. Developers can also create their own modules and import them into scripts if needed,\nClasses and objects\nVerse employs a class-based object-oriented programming model. Developers can define classes to represent various game entities and behaviors.\nFor example:\nhello_world_device\u00a0:= class(creative_device):\n    OnBegin<override>()<suspends>:void=\n        Print(\"Hello, world!\")\n        Print(\"2 + 2 = {2 + 2}\")\nThe above code defines a new class inheriting from `creative_device` and prints the traditional \"Hello, world\" message. All classes inherited from a `creative_device' can be placed into the engine's spatial environment when compiled. The `creative_device` class is necessary to interact with the pre-existing Fortnite Creative toolset.\nFunctions and methods\nVerse allows defining functions within classes. These can perform various operations, such as mathematical calculations, game logic, and more. The example below is a method to determine if a character is looking at a specific location.\nIsLookingAtLocation(Character:fort_character, LocationToCheck: vector3, Threshold: float):logic\nEvent handling\nThe language supports event-driven programming, where events like EliminatedEvent and PlayerAddedEvent can trigger specified functions. Events can also be subscribed to and listened for.\nMathematical and spatial operations\nVerse supports various mathematical functions necessary for game development, such as calculating magnitudes, normalizing vectors, and converting rotations to direction vectors. The spatial math module provides classes and functions for vector and rotational math, essential for game development tasks like positioning and movement.Cos, Normalize, Distance , ArcTan,  and Lerp are a few of the functions are available for mathematical operations.\nLambda Calculus\nVerse code shares several similarities with lambda calculus, particularly in how it handles functions and data. In lambda calculus, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables; while in Verse functions can be passed around and manipulated similarly, showcasing the functional programming paradigm. Examples include methods like Normalize(v1:vector3) and DrawDebugLine(LineStart: vector3, LineEnd: vector3). Verse supports lambda expressions and anonymous functions, allowing for inline function definitions, similar to how lambda functions are used in languages like Python or JavaScript. Verse also allows for composing functions by chaining method calls and passing functions as parameters. The declarative style used in lambda calculus is also a prominent feature of Verse for defining data transformations and computations rather than an imperative control flow model. This is seen in functions like Normalize and DrawDebugLine which are defined declaratively.\nFuture plans\nEpic Games has described Verse as the programming language for the metaverse and has factored mass scalability into its development. Until the proposed convergence with Unreal Engine, it is yet to be seen how Verse will behave interacting with various systems and processes outside of the Fortnite ecosystem.\n",
    "Online forum\nBoyChat is an internet support forum founded by the Free Spirits. The website describes itself as being frequented mostly by people who are attracted to \"teen and/or pre-teen boys\".\nThe forum has stated that its goal is to help its users live productive lives instead of inflicting harm on people under the age of consent. The website is part of a group of support websites organized by the Free Spirits, a Canadian nonprofit organization. Explicit and unlawful materials, as well as \"erotica or overly\u2010detailed sexual discussions\", are not allowed on the website.\nHistory\nBoyChat was founded in 1995 by the Free Spirits, a nonprofit organization based in Montreal, Canada, that has managed a number of support websites for people who are attracted to minors. The forum has been part of a network of other similar forums in other languages managed by the organization, including Castillo Azul (in Spanish), Jongens Forum (German), Jungs Forum (Dutch) and La Garconni\u00e8re (French). BoyChat has also been a partner site of and reciprocally linked to Annabelleigh.\nPerverted-Justice president Xavier von Erck stated in 2007 that BoyChat was part of a growing trend of pedophile websites. He told The Gazette in the same year that the Free Spirits \"has been around since 1995 and has thousands of members\", and that, \"at one point, they were hosting 85 pedophile websites\".\nContent\nAs of 2022, BoyChat was divided between a number of boards, including the main board, Meta BoyChat for discussions related to the website's functioning, Treehouse for real-time discussions, Other Chat for off-topic discussions and a board titled You Can't Do That On BoyChat, where some rule-breaking posts are listed. As of 2004, the website was receiving an average of 230 posts per day.\nThe forum has functioned as a peer-support group for its users. An introductory text on the website stated that BoyChat is a forum where people can \"learn to lead productive lives in ways that help young people rather than harm them\", \"communicate positively and find emotional support\". The logo of the forum reads BoyChat: you are not alone.\nDemographics\nAlthough the precise demographics of BoyChat's userbase is difficult to assess due to its anonymous structure, BoyChat has stated that its users are mostly adult males.\nIn a series of posts made on BoyChat in 2004, euphemistic labeling, a psychological process proposed by some researchers of child sexual abuse, was present in 24% of the messages. Other cognitive distortions were relatively uncommon, with moral and psychological justifications for sexual abuse appearing in 5% and 2% of the posts, respectively, and 1% and 2% of the sample minimizing or misattributing the consequences of sexual relationships with minors. The idea that minors are able to consent to sex with adults was present in 3% of the messages.\nRules\nBoyChat does not allow explicit or illegal materials, including pictures and external links to child pornography, to be posted on the website. Posting \"erotica or overly\u2010detailed sexual discussions\" is also forbidden by the forum's rules. The website also prohibits posts that \"advocate or counsel sex with minors\", a rule that, the forum states, \"does not extend to philosophical, political, or biological discussions\". Other rules of the forum forbid users from encouraging others to engage in illegal activities or engaging in harassment campaigns against other users.\n",

The power will be transmitted from the wind farm to the off-taker by Eskom, the national electricity utility company under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) and a long-term  \"wheeling agreement\".\nLocation\nThe power station is located near the town of Murraysburg, in \tBeaufort West, in Central Karoo District in extreme northeastern Western Cape Province, close to its border with the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Murraysburg is located approximately 619 kilometres (385\u00a0mi), by road, northeast of Cape Town, the provincial capital.\nOverview\nThe design calls for a wind farm with generation capacity of 140 megawatts.\nDevelopers\nThe table below illustrates the ownership of this power station. The owner(s) are expected to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) company to own, design, fund, build, operate and maintain the wind farm. For descriptive purposes, we will refer to the SPV company as Umsinde Emoyeni Power Consortium.\nFunding and time table\nAfrican Infrastructure Investment Managers (AIIM) are funding the renewable energy project. AIIM is the parent entity of the two main  shareholders, ACED and EIMS Africa. The project received financial support from Old Mutual Alternative Investments (OMAI)\u2019s IDEAS Fund and from a syndicated loan arranged by Rand Merchant Bank. Construction is expected to start in June 2024 with commercial commissioning planned in the fourth quarter of 2026.\nOther considerations\nWith the attainment of financial closure for Umsinde Emoyeni Wind Farm, Sibanye-Stillwater has attained 407 MW of green renewable energy for its exclusive use, in its decarbonization and greening efforts. The 407 MW mitigates 24 percent of the miner's carbon footprint, equivalent to approximately 1,450,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, beginning in January 2027. Sibanye-Stillwater still plans to increase this portfolio of renewable green power sources to 600 MW, as it progresses towards total carbon neutrality by 2040.\nSee also\nSouth Africa portalRenewable energy portal\nList of power stations in South Africa\nWesley\u2013Ciskei Wind Power Station\nKangnas Wind Power Station\n",

The race was held on Saturday, April 1, 2023, at Irwindale Speedway in Irwindale, California, a 0.50 mile (0.80\u00a0km) permanent asphalt oval shaped short track. The race took the scheduled 150 laps to complete. In an action-packed race, Sean Hingorani, driving for Venturini Motorsports, would hold off a challenging Landen Lewis throughout the entire race, and led the final 16 laps of the race to earn his first career ARCA Menards Series West win. Pole-sitter Trevor Huddleston dominated the early portions of the race, leading the first 72 laps, before falling back in the final stage and finishing 4th. Hingorani led 61 laps and had a hard-fought battle with Landen Lewis throughout the remainder of the event. To fill out the podium, Tyler Reif, driving for Lowden Jackson Motorsports, would finish in 3rd, respectively.\nReport\nBackground\nIrwindale Speedway, the circuit where the race was held.\nThe Irwindale Speedway & Event Center (a.k.a. Irwindale Speedway, Irwindale Dragstrip, or \"The House of Drift\") is a motorsports facility located in Irwindale, California, United States. It opened on March 27, 1999, under the official name Irwindale Speedway. Toyota purchased the naming rights to the facility in 2008, and from that time until 2011 it was also known as the Toyota Speedway at Irwindale.\nThe speedway features banked, paved 1\u20442- and 1\u20443-mile oval tracks and a 1\u20448-mile drag strip. The property is primarily used for NASCAR races such as ARCA Menards Series West and Whelen All-American Series events. In late 2011, NASCAR announced it was dropping Toyota Speedway from its schedule. The company that managed the track, Irwindale Speedway LLC, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on February 13, 2012.\nEntry list\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\nPractice\nThe first and only practice session was held on Saturday, April 1, at 3:30 PM PST, and would last for 1 hour.

    "American embezzler (1890\u20131957)\nJames T. Peasgood (March 8, 1890\u00a0\u2013 July 12, 1957) was a municipal treasurer who was convicted in 1922 of embezzling from the city of Venice, California, United States. After serving three and a half years in San Quentin State Prison, Peasgood moved to Salinas, California, where he ran produce-packing companies. \nBiography\nPeasgood was born in Pennsylvania but had come to California at early days with his father, who became a Santa Monica city councilman and Santa Monica superintendent of buildings. Before taking a position in local government, Peasgood had served as a teller at the First National Bank of Venice. Peasgood had served as Venice city treasurer for seven years before he suddenly vanished in April 1922. According to a history published in 1975, \"Peasgood's troubles started in May of 1921 when rumors began to stir around the canal city that Venice was on the verge of bankruptcy. The Los Angeles County Grand Jury began to make inquiries and the Venetian mayor suddenly resigned. Treasurer Peasgood was eventually hauled before the grand jury on five counts of misconduct in office. The charges stemmed from his habit of depositing city funds in certain banks without collecting interest on the monies. The grand jury dismissed the charges and James Peasgood rested a little easier.\"\nHowever, two days after the city of Venice hired an independent auditor, Peasgood suddenly left for a fishing trip to Oxnard on Saturday, April 29, and did not return for the workweek following, leading the city council to elevate his deputy to the treasurer position. According to the Los Angeles Examiner, Peasgood left a note for his wife that read, \"I have been playing a losing game and I cannot stay and face the disgrace. You will never see me again!\"\nAn independent auditor was brought in and discovered $19,000 missing from the city's accounts. Peasgood turned himself in on May 17, 1922, confessing that he had taken the money to pay gambling debts and sustain an extravagant lifestyle. Peasgood had apparently been monkeying with the books since 1918. According to the Venice Vanguard:\nHis statement revealed that a home, upon which he was called to make substantial monthly payments, furniture for same, a piano and an automobile, all bought on installments together with increased living costs, resulted in fixed monthly expenses which the salary he was paid fell considerably short of meeting. Thus grew, from month to month, a deficit, to meet which Peasgood, desperate and seeking to maintain his credit and standing as a city official, began borrowing now and then from the paving bond fund, held and handled by him in trust. Thus, in turn, was created an accumulated shortage in the paving bond fund and to prevent the discovery of this condition, Peasgood, according to his explanation, transferred moneys from the general fund of the city. These amounts from the general fund, as nearly as Peasgood could remember, tally almost to the cent with the figures arrived at and submitted by Macleod, Macfarlane and Co. in their report to the trustees last Monday evening.\nPeasgood was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to one to 10 years in the state penitentiary. He served approximately three and a half years, from December 15, 1922, to July 15, 1926, in San Quentin prison. The theft shook public confidence in the government of the city of Venice, a shift that contributed to the Venice electorate's decision to accept annexation by the city of Los Angeles in 1925. Peasgood eventually moved to Salinas in Monterey County and worked in the fruit-packing industry. He died in Salinas in 1957.\nPeasgood at San Quentin\n",

Her parents spoke High German when she was young, her mother in memory of Vienna, her father because he preferred it to the Glarus dialect. After they decided to live in Geneva, French was spoken in the family. The family were part of the Protestant Geneva bourgeoisie. At the age of six, she invented the characters Mimi and No\u00e9mie, who were allowed to do things that Z'Graggen was not allowed to do.\nShe earned her high school Maturit\u00e9 in Geneva and then trained as a secretary. She also studied at the University of Florence.\nDuring the Second World War, Z'Graggen worked for the International Red Cross from 1941 to 1946.\nCareer\nIn 1939 she wrote her first book, L'Appel du r\u00eave, which was published five years later in 1944 under the pseudonym Dani\u00e8le Marnan.

From 1982 to 1989, Z'Graggen worked at the Com\u00e9die de Gen\u00e8ve theatre when it was under the direction of Benno Besson.\nHer 1982 book, Les ann\u00e9es silencieuses (The Years of Silence) dealt with the Swiss refugee policy of the war years and the shame of those who had not recognised their shortcomings. In Matthias Berg (1995) and Ciel d'Allemagne (Germany's Sky (1996) she considered the ambivalent feelings her generation harboured towards Germany. In M\u00e9moire d'elles (1999) she used two letters discovered in her late mother's belongings to explore the life of her grandmother.\nPersonal life\nIn 1953, she married Robert Brunel, with whom she had a daughter in 1963. The marriage ended in divorce in 1978.\nYvette Z'Graggen in 2003\nDeath and commemoration\nYvette Z'Graggen died on 16 April 2012 in Geneva at the age of 92, after a long illness.

    "\nZaou\u00efa sufi sunni maliki school in Wilaya of Algiers, Algeria\nThe Zaou\u00efa of Sidi Sa\u00e2di is a religious building located in Algiers, Algeria. It is part of the Zaou\u00efas in Algeria affiliated with the Rahmaniya Sufi order under the supervision of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Wakfs and the Algerian Religious Reference.\nConstruction\nThe theologian \"Sidi Sa\u00e2di\" constructed this zaou\u00efa in 1706 above what is now the \"Jardin de Prague\" in the Kettani neighborhood of Bab El Oued, traversed by the \"Rampe \u0623\u0631\u0632\u0642\u064a \u0644\u0648\u0646\u064a\".\nThe full name of this learned faq\u012bh is \"Abou Abdallah Mohamed ben Mohamed Sa\u00e2di\".\nHe acquired a plot of land of about five hectares at the western exit of the Casbah of Algiers in 1706 Gregorian equivalent to 1118 Hijri.\nThis land overlooked the Bay of Algiers and the estuary where the Oued Mkacel flows.\nThe history of the Casbah of Algiers mentions that it was Mezzomorto H\u00fcseyin Pasha, then Ra\u00efs of the Regency of Algiers, who rewarded this theologian for his religious activities in the Algerian city, allowing him to acquire this land.\nThe dilapidated buildings that existed on this large plot were refurbished after its acquisition, and several other buildings were erected over a year of sustained work.\nUpon completion of the new version of this zaou\u00efa in 1707, this place of worship was then registered in the Habous records of Dar Es-Soltane.\nDescription\nThe zaou\u00efa of Sidi Sa\u00e2di comprised several buildings:\nA mosque without a minaret, with a roof in tiles in the Berber architectural style.\nA house for the cheikh of the zaou\u00efa.\nA mausoleum honoring the late \"Sidi Sa\u00e2di\".\nClassrooms for teaching the Qur'an and Islamic sciences.\nAccommodation for the disciples.\nMausoleum\nThe mausoleum of \"Sidi Sa\u00e2di\" was located within the zaou\u00efa's enclosure, where he was buried upon his death in 1734 Gregorian equivalent to 1147 Hijri.\nIt was registered as a protected building in the records of Dar Es-Soltane by a notarial deed.\nThis dome containing a shrine was less than a kilometer from the Zaou\u00efa of Sidi Abderrahmane and the Emir Abdelkader High School.\nVisitors practiced tawassul and du'a according to the precepts of the Algerian Religious Reference.\nWaqfs\nThe zaou\u00efa of Sidi Sa\u00e2di funded its operations and maintenance through revenues generated from various waqf properties it owned.\nThese waqf properties included several buildings that formed the endowment of this zaou\u00efa:\nAn agricultural field.\nThree rental houses.\nTwo pottery workshops.\nTwo shops.\nThe income from these waqf properties enabled the zaou\u00efa to sustain its religious, educational, and social activities.\nImportance\nThe zaou\u00efa of Sidi Sa\u00e2di played a significant role in the spiritual and social life of Algiers. It served as a center for Islamic education and the dissemination of the Rahmaniya Sufi order's teachings. It was also a place of refuge and support for the needy, embodying the principles of charity and community service central to the Sufi tradition.\nDecline\nOver the years, the influence and activities of the zaou\u00efa diminished due to various socio-political changes in Algeria. The site itself experienced neglect and deterioration, reflecting broader changes in the urban landscape and religious practices in Algiers.\nRestoration efforts\nIn recent years, there have been initiatives to restore and preserve the zaou\u00efa of Sidi Sa\u00e2di as part of efforts to maintain Algeria's cultural and religious heritage. These efforts aim to revitalize the zaou\u00efa as a historical landmark and a living center of Sufi practice and community life.\nSee also\nRahmaniya\nSufi order\nBab El Oued\nCasbah of Algiers\n",

    "American architectural firm\nDavis, McGrath & Kiessling was an architecture firm formed as a partnership of Herbert E. Davis, Dudley McGrath and Calvin Kiessling (previously Davis & Shepard and Davis, McGrath & Shepard), that was active between 1910 and 1921. The New York firm specialized in design of homes and public buildings on the East Coast of the United States, with an emphasis on the \"Italian Renaissance Revival\" and \"Jacobethan Revival\" styles. A number of its works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nHistory\nThe New York firm of Davis, McGrath and Kiessling existed as a partnership from 1910 until 1921 and located at 175 Fifth Avenue (in the Flatiron Building). Herbert E. Davis, who was born in Newark, was a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was resident of Glen Ridge from 1910 until 1929 and designed numerous houses in Glen Ridge and Montclair. Dudley McGrath, a Brooklyn native who attended Columbia University, was an active member of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects and was well known in the field of residential design until his death in 1922. Calvin Kiessling, who was born in Boston and began his career with Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, left the firm in 1921 and moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, where he was credited with initiating the use of Colonial Revival architecture in the New Canaan business district. Prior to their partnership, Kiessling designed a number of Carnegie libraries, including the Colorado Springs Public Library (extant) and the Davenport Public Library (demolished in 1966, and replaced by a library designed by Edward Durell Stone).\nStructures\nIndustrial Savings Bank Building, 2014\nThe following is a list of structures designed by the firm, ordered by state and locality:\nMassachusetts\nBrookline:\nBrookline House, c.\u20091911\nMichigan\nFlint:\nCharles Stewart Mott House (known as Applewood), 1400 E.

    "2024 video game\nKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is an upcoming action-strategy game developed and published by Capcom. The game is set to be released for Windows PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Series S in July 2024.\nGameplay\nKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is an action game played from a third-person perspective, and features elements from real-time strategy and tower defense games. In the game, the player assumes control of Soh, who is tasked to protect a divine maiden named Yoshiro who must \"purge and cleanse\" villages of \"defilement\" and return the legendary Mt. Kafuku to peace.\nGameplay is divided into two different parts. Daytime is the preparatory phase in which Soh must explore the village and rescue villagers, as well as setting up various contraptions. At night, evil spirits named the \"Seethe\" will invade the village from Torii gates, and the player must ally with the rescued villagers to defend Yorshiro from hostile attacks until sunrise. Players can strategically place villagers in tactical positions, and assign them with different roles. For instance, a woodcutter is a powerful melee attacker, while an archer can provide ranged support. Players can also further equip Soh and the villagers with one of twelve masks that also grant them divine powers. The position and the roles of the villagers can also be changed during combat. If Soh becomes severely injured in the game, he will enter \"Spirit mode\", allowing him to continue issuing commands to other villagers.\nDevelopment\nKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is developed by Capcom Development Division 1, the studio behind games such as Resident Evil and Devil May Cry. Shuichi Kawata, who previously worked on Shinsekai: Into the Depths, is the game's lead director. Development of the game lasted for more than four years. Like Shinsekai: Into the Depths and Okami, the game was heavily inspired by Japanese folklores. Soh's combat was inspired by an ancient ceremonial form of dance named kagura, while enemy design was influenced by Japanese yokai. The game is powered by Capcom's in-house RE Engine.\nKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess was officially revealed by Capcom in June 2023. The game is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Series S on July 19, 2024, and will be available at no additional cost for Xbox Game Pass subscribers at launch. Players who pre-ordered the game will receive additional in-game items and an artbook.\n",

    "\nWilliam Joppy vs. Roberto Dur\u00e1n, billed as Legendary History was a professional boxing match contested on \nAugust 28, 1998, for the WBA middleweight title.\nBackground\nIn his previous fight, William Joppy had regained the WBA middleweight title after defeating Julio C\u00e9sar Green, whom had upset him the previous year to take the title, in a rematch. For the first defense of his second reign, 28-year old Joppy was matched up against former 4-division world champion Roberto Dur\u00e1n, whom at 47-years old was two decades older than his opponent and had turned professional in 1967, 3 years prior to Joppy's birth. Dur\u00e1n had not fought for a major world title since challenging Sugar Ray Leonard for WBC super middleweight title in December 1989 and had had limited success since then, only defeating unknown journeymen and losing the three big fights (two against Vinny Paz and one against H\u00e9ctor Camacho) he did have.\nDur\u00e1n, who had been experiencing financial troubles, excepted Joppy's promoter Don King's offer of a $250,000 purse. After his payday became public knowledge, a Florida judge issued an injunction against King and Showtime (whom was to broadcast the fight), claiming Dur\u00e1n owed $41,000 in child support to the mother of his 10-year-old son, while the IRS looked to seize part of the purse due to Dur\u00e1n owing $300,000 in unpaid taxes.\nWhen the fight was first announced, it was to take place on June 6 as the featured undercard bout on an event headlined by an Evander Holyfield\u2013Henry Akinwande heavyweight title bout. However, when Akinwande tested positive for Hepatitis B the day before the fight, the entire card was cancelled. The Joppy\u2013Dur\u00e1n fight was then rescheduled for August 29 (and then subsequently moved up a day to August 28) with a Bernard Hopkins\u2013Robert Allen IBF middleweight championship as the co-headliner.\nThe fight\nDur\u00e1n, looking every bit his age, was dominated by Joppy who landed punches nearly at will. After easily winning the first two rounds on the scorecards, Joppy wobbled Dur\u00e1n early in the third round and proceeded to continue to brutalize Dur\u00e1n, who offered little offensively or defensively, for the remainder of the round until referee Joe Cortez stopped the fight with six seconds left in the round and awarded Joppy the victory by technical knockout.\nAfter the fight Dur\u00e1n all but officially announced his retirement stating simply \"I am finished.\", though he would return the following year and fight until 2001. Said Joppy of the victory \"This was kind of a sad victory for me, Roberto Duran is a great legend. I've watched him fight since I was a kid. But it's my time now. He's had his years. I want to have mine.\"\nFight card\n^Note 1 For WBA Middleweight title ^Note 2 For IBF Middleweight title ^Note 3 For NABA Cruiserweight title\n",

    "1340 battle in Denmark\nThe Battle of Nonnebjerg (Danish: Slaget ved Nonnebjerget), also known as the Battle of Skanderborg (Danish: Slaget ved Skanderborg) and the Battle of Marbjerg (Danish: Slaget ved Marbjerg), was a battle near Skanderborg Castle on 2 November 1340 between Holsteinian and Danish rebel forces. The result is generally considered a German victory, with the Danish rebel leader, Niels Ebbesen being killed in action.\nBackground\nIn the early 14th century, Denmark was under the control of foreign powers, with Count Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg holding significant sway over a large portion of the country by the 1330s. However, in 1340, a group of 50 Jutes, led by Niels Ebbesen, a minor nobleman, launched a surprise attack on Count Gerhard in Randers, resulting in his assassination which sent shockwaves throughout the country. In the aftermath, Ebbesen and his followers fled south across the Guden\u00e5 River, using a bridge to escape.\nAs they continued their revolt further south, Ebbesen and his men stormed a Holsteinian fortification located near present-day Skjern, killing many Germans. Next, Ebbesen sought to capture the strategically important Skanderborg Castle.\nPrelude\nMain article: Siege of Skanderborg\nWhile besieging Skanderborg, the besieged Germans received help from a 600-strong relief force of professional knights, and the Danes were now confronted by two sides.\nBattle\nAt a hill outside Skanderborg, the two sides met in open terrain. The Danish force was roughly 2,000 strong, consisting of peasants and knights, while the German force was made up of armed knights and cavalry. The ensuing battle of bloody and stubborn. At last, the Jutish peasants began to flee and were ousted. Followingly, the Danish landlords and knights, seeing the now superior German forces, decided to give up. A massive bloodbath followed with up to 2,200 Danes killed, including Ebbesen and his two brothers.\nAftermath\nAccording to the L\u00fcbeck Chronicle, the Danish bodies were dismembered and put on wheels and pillars, by the Holsteinian counts as revenge for the assassination of their father, Gerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg, and given as food for the birds.\nAccording to the Chronica Jutensis, the Danes won the battle, however, it agrees with the L\u00fcbeck Chronicle that Niels Ebbesen died in the battle. According to the Chronica Sialandie, another final battle should have taken place at Manbjerg.\nLegacy\nAs a memory of the battle of death of Niels Ebbesen, there has been raised a memorial stone in Skanderborg near European route E75. It was raised a couple of years after the Second Schleswig War, when anti-Germanisation was at its highest in Denmark. Additionally, N. F. S. Grundtvig has also published a psalm on Ebbesen's revolt and fall in 1839.\nSee also\nSiege of Kolding (1368\u20131369)\u00a0\u2013 Siege in Denmark, 1369\nSiege of Vordingborg\u00a0\u2013 Siege between the Hanseatic League and Denmark between 1368\u20131370\nSiege of Copenhagen (1368)\u00a0\u2013 Siege and looting of Copenhagen by Hanseatic forces in 1368\nBattle of Lunden\u00e6s\u00a0\u2013 1340 battle in Denmark\n",
    "Romanian politician and agronomist\nRomulus Z\u0103roni or Zeroni (Hungarian: Zaroni Romulusz; 28 April 1906 \u2013 23 October 1962) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian politician and agronomist, who collaborated with Petru Groza in establishing the left-agrarian Ploughmen's Front.\nBiography\nBeginnings\nZ\u0103roni was born on 28 April 1906 in Hunyad County, Transylvania (the region as a whole was in the Hungarian partition of Austria-Hungary). Sources report his exact birthplace as either H\u0103\u0219dat (now part of Hunedoara city) or N\u0103d\u0103\u0219tia de Sus (absorbed by C\u0103lan). In some descriptions, he is listed as \"a simple man  a peasant from \u021aara Ha\u021begului\", located further to the south, on what was then the border with the Kingdom of Romania; his ethnic Romanian parents are known to have been named Ioan and Eva. His official biography noted that he was the son of \"destitute plow-wielding peasants\", and that he himself \"toiled from his earliest years to for his parents' sliver of land, to earn himself a bitter loaf of bread.\" Various sources contradict this take, describing the Z\u0103ronis as a family of wealthy peasants, or chiaburi.\nAttending primary school in N\u0103d\u0103\u0219tia de Sus, Romulus witnessed the union of Transylvania with Romania, during which he had enrolled at what later became Decebal National College in Deva. Young Z\u0103roni reportedly got interested in the \"workers' movements and the proletariat's struggle\", which became main subjects on his reading list. He is known to have studied at an agricultural school in Weimar Germany, returning as a trained agronomist with a direct involvement in improving working techniques\u2014back home, he set up a model farm. In October 1931, Ioan Mo\u021ba's newspaper Libertatea hosted Z\u0103roni's letter calling for a near-complete prohibition. In this text, he was also claiming that the production and sale of spirits was a Jewish business, whereby \"the Jewish heathen sucks dry the soul of this nation\". Rumors recorded by historian Sorin Radu and Cosmin Budeanc\u0103 claim that Z\u0103roni's first political engagement was with a right-wing group called \"Agrarian League\", which he represented during an election in Timi\u0219oara. The authors note that such accounts remain uncorroborated. Z\u0103roni was however officially registered as a League candidate for the Assembly of Deputies in Hunedoara County for elections in July 1932.\nZ\u0103roni eventually rallied with the peasants' protest movement, formed in reaction to the Great Depression; as one of Petru Groza's \"closest collaborators\", he helped establish the Ploughmen's Front in early 1933, when he was aged 26. Unverified reports suggest that he was also Groza's employee, or \"servant\", at a mill in C\u0103lan-Strei. Z\u0103roni's output included amateur poetry, taken up by the Front's newspaper Horia in 1932\u20131933. Samples include the fable S\u0103tulul nu crede \u0103lui fl\u0103m\u00e2nd (\"Those Who Have Dismiss Those Who Have Not\"). In February 1933, he published therein a sketch of the Front's political program. It called on all peasants to unite into a single political-and-professional organization, while also demanding that the state abolish its courts of arbitration, or Agricultural Chambers, seeing them as instruments of exploitation. That April, speaking at the Front's first congress in Deva, he expressed the belief that the movement would soon catch on \"throughout the country.\" He was thereafter leader of the Front's plas\u0103-level organization in Hunedoara\u2014in which capacity he \"stood up to the landowners and the exploiters\", convincing various peasants that they should never vote for the leading right- and left-wing parties. He therefore competed with a dominant agrarian force, the National Peasants' Party (PN\u021a), but still had friendly contacts with some of its representatives, including Corneliu Coposu. The latter provided some biographical detail on Z\u0103roni, reporting that he had once attended a congress of the International Agrarian Bureau in Prague.\nZ\u0103roni was fourth on the Ploughmen's Front list during the Assembly election of December 1933\u2014his colleague Miron Berlea held the top position. Their activity, and that of the Front as a whole, soon became intertwined with efforts undertaken by the underground Romanian Communist Party (PCR, or PCdR). According to the latter's official reports, Z\u0103roni had grown \"convinced that the working class, with the Communist Party at its helm, was the only political force that could express the workers' community aspirations toward a dignified and free life\". He therefore militated \"for the industrial workers' alliance with the toiling peasantry\". Z\u0103roni took the initiative in sealing pacts with the PCR and its satellites: in September 1935, he signed the accord of B\u0103cia, creating an alliance between the Front and the Hungarian People's Union (MADOSZ), which represented pro-communist sections of the Hungarian Romanian community; in December, he approved of the \u021aebea alliance with the United Socialists. He was however supportive of drawing the PN\u021a into a popular front, a",

He also joined the University of Johannesburg's public law faculty, becoming an associate professor in January 2010 and a full professor in December 2012. As of 2024, he was the university's Professor of Fundamental Rights and Constitutional Law, and, since July 2020, he has additionally been a part-time professor at the University of Reading in Reading, England. He has held fellowships at the University of Sydney in 2009 and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in 2016, and he has been a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore, the Humboldt University of Berlin, and the Tel Aviv University.\nScholarship\nThe National Research Foundation has twice (in 2012 and 2019) given Bilchitz a B1 rating for internationally acclaimed research on human rights and constitutionalism. In addition to co-editing five collections, he has published two monographs: The Justification and Enforcement of Socio-Economic Rights in 2007, on socioeconomic rights, and Fundamental Rights and the Legal Obligations of Business in 2021, on corporate obligations with respect to fundamental rights.\nOther academic activities\nIn tandem with his research, from 2011 to 2023, Bilchitz was a member of the South African Law Reform Commission's Advisory Committee on the Law Relating to Witchcraft, and he was appointed to the boards of the Constitutional Court Trust and Animal Law Reform South Africa in 2015 and 2017 respectively. In 2020, he was appointed as the managing editor of the Constitutional Court Review.\nInternationally, he has been the vice-president of the International Association of Constitutional Law since June 2020, having formerly served as the organisation's secretary-general from 2013 to 2020. In 2022 he was shortlisted for possible appointment as the African representative to the United Nations Working Group on Business and Human Rights.\nConstitutional Court\nIn October 2023, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that Bilchitz had been appointed to serve as an acting judge of the Constitutional Court between 1 February and 31 March 2024. Two years earlier, Bilchitz himself had argued publicly that academics should be directly appointed to the court in this fashion. During his service in the court, he dissented from the majority's order of dismissal in Rivonia Circle v President of SA.\nMeanwhile, Bilchitz became one of five candidates shortlisted for possible permanent appointment to the Constitutional Court, the others being Matthew Chaskalson, Alan Dodson, Tati Makgoka, and Ashton Schippers. He was the first legal academic to be shortlisted in several years, and Judges Matter suggested that his limited experience \u2013 both as a judge and as a practising lawyer \u2013 might disadvantage him.

    "1991 short story by Greg Egan\n\"Appropriate Love\" is a science-fiction short story by Australian writer Greg Egan, first published in Interzone #50 in August 1991. The short story was included in the collection Axiomatic in 1995 and The Best of Greg Egan in 2019.\nPlot\nAfter a horrible car crash, which completely shattered the body of her husband Chris Perrini, his wife Carla Perrini is offered a strange solution to restore his former life as their insurance only covers the cheapest option: By enclosing his brain in a fluid-filled membrane, putting it inside her uterus and connecting it to her bloodflow, it can be kept alive while a new brainless body is cloned for him. The process takes two years in total. Chris wakes up in his new body and expresses his love for Carla. When they sleep together again, she begins to realize, that the fake pregnancy and his youthful body causes her to begin loving him like a son.\nTranslation\nThe short story was translated into French by Sylvie Denis and Francis Val\u00e9ry (1994 and 2006), Finnish by Tapani Ronni (1997), German by Irene Holicki (1998), Hungarian by Orsolya Erdo (1998), Spanish by Carlos Pav\u00f3n and Sonia Baldr\u00e9s (1998), Czech by Petr Kotrle (1998), Romanian by Mihai-Dan Pavelescu and Florin P\u00eetea (1999), Italian by Riccardo Valla (2003), Japanese by Makoto Yamagishi (2003) as well as Korean by Kim Sang-hoon (2002). The French translation appeared under two different titles, the former being \"Baby Brain\" and the latter being a French translation of \"Appropriate Love\". The Chinese translation appeared in Science Fiction World, as well as in translations of the collections Axiomatic and The Best of Greg Egan.\nReception\nReviews\nRussell Letson, writing in the Locus Magazine, states that \"Egan does not shrink from looking into any abyss, whether the topic is the authenticity of subjectivity or the genuineness of the most intimate relationships.\" He adds that \"the agent of change is not some neurological black box but, ironically, the severe physical and emotional adaptations the narrator undergoes in order to save her husband\u2019s life. Nevertheless, despite her genuine initial devotion, romantic attachment evaporates.\"\nKaren Burnham writes in Greg Egan (Modern Masters of Science Fiction), that the short story \"asks how much trauma we may require loved ones to go through in order to preserve the life of a family member\" and that \"Egan\u2019s fiction paints a rather cynical view of the healthcare industry as a whole and the insurance industry in particular.\"\nAwards\nThe short story reached the 9th place in the Interzone Reader's Poll in 1992 and was nominated for the Seiun Award in 2004.\nLiterature\nBurnham, Karen (2014).

    "1995 studio album by the Walter Trout Band\nBreaking the Rules is the fifth solo studio album by American blues rock musician Walter Trout, credited to the Walter Trout Band. Recorded from January 15 to February 28, 1995, at Soundcastle in Los Angeles, California, it was Trout's first album to be self-produced, and was released on June 6, 1995, by Provogue Records. The album reached number 58 on the Dutch Albums Chart and number 4 on the UK Jazz & Blues Albums Chart.\nBackground\nAfter releasing his band's fourth studio album Tellin' Stories on Silvertone Records, Walter Trout returned to his original label Provogue Records for Breaking the Rules. In a 1999 interview, the guitarist recalled that \"they  didn't do a very good job for me, either in Europe or America. All my record sales in Europe started to go down and I realised that Europe was my bread and butter\", leading to him re-signing with Provogue. Recording for Breaking the Rules took place between January 15 and February 28, 1995, at Soundcastle in Los Angeles, California, with Trout taking on production duties for the first time in his career.\nReception\nCommercial\nBreaking the Rules reached number 58 on the Dutch Albums Chart and number 4 on the UK Jazz & Blues Albums Chart.\nCritical\nBreaking the Rules received positive reviews from critics. Reviewing the album for the Los Angeles Times, Mike Boehm proclaimed it to be Trout's best album since 1990's Prisoner of a Dream, writing that \"Trout can handle pop and rock songwriting, as well as play within the styles and forms of traditional blues. His approach here is to strike a balance \u2013 a good choice that lets him blaze bluesily on some tracks, while demonstrating a good ear for melody on such pop-leaning highlights\". Boehm also praised Trout's first effort as a producer, claiming that he \"gives himself and his band mates something they lacked on Tellin' Stories and its predecessor, Transition: a broad, uncluttered sonic field on which to operate\". A review in Music & Media described Breaking the Rules as \"a refreshing mix of rock and blues\".\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Walter Trout; track 7 co-written by Jimmy Trapp, Bernard Pershey and Martin Gerschwitz\nPersonnel\nWalter Trout Band\nWalter Trout \u2013 vocals, guitar, harmonica, production, art concept\nJimmy Trapp \u2013 bass\nBernard Pershey \u2013 drums, percussion\nMartin Gerschwitz \u2013 keyboards, violin\nAdditional musicians\nTeresa James \u2013 backing vocals\nDanny Timms \u2013 backing vocals\nAdditional personnel\nCharlie Watts \u2013 engineering\nTim Nitz \u2013 engineering assistance\nGabe Chiesa \u2013 engineering assistance\nMike Iacopelli \u2013 mastering\nPaul Roos \u2013 design\nDora Larson \u2013 illustration\nCharts\nFootnotes\n^ Trout is also credited under the alias \"Wally Bass\" with performing backing vocals.\n",
    "American folk/Americana group\nMusical artist\nRoma di Luna was an American folk/Americana group from Minneapolis, Minnesota formed in 2004. The band released four records, including most recently We Were Made To Forgive in 2018. The group began as a husband-and-wife duo comprising Alexei Casselle of Kill the Vultures and Channy Leaneagh, later of Poli\u00e7a, before expanding to a group of seven.\nWhile the group did not break through to mainstream success, they were consistently praised by critics and musicians such as Liz Phair.\nHistory\n2004-07: Formation, Face Of My Friends, and Find Your Way Home\nCasselle and Leaneagh met in high school and dated off and on before starting a musical duo in 2004, and started performing by busking at local farmer's markets in Minneapolis. The name \"Roma di Luna\" roughly translates to \"gypsies of the moon,\" and refers to the band's interest in Eastern European folk music, and shared European and Native American heritage.\nCasselle had previously been known as a rapper with the groups Oddjobs and Kill the Vultures. His interest in blues and folk music was ignited by becoming a fan of Bob Dylan while living in New York with Oddjobs, which inspired him to learn guitar. Leaneagh, who grew up listening to folk and Americana music, was also classically trained on violin.Leaneagh was also influenced by singers such as Billie Holiday, Hank Williams, and Indian and South Asian female singers. (She had lived in Southeast Asia for  several years.) The couple co-wrote most of their songs, which often dealt with dark, serious topics, such as violence in north Minneapolis and Casselle's relationship with his father, as well as the couple's shared Native American heritage. Star Tribune critic Chris Riemenschneider described the duo as a \"rustic, semirootsy, sometimes uncomfortably intimate folk act.\" He also praised Leaneagh's singing as \"riveting ... at once sirenlike and sweet but also fragile and haunted-sounding. It's a sharp contrast to  booming, dry, leathery voice.\" Casselle worked on both Kill the Vultures and Roma di Luna simultaneously. Casselle and Leaneagh married in 2005.\nThe duo released a short EP, Face Of My Friends, in 2006. Riemenschneider's review called it \"a less-than-happy mix of haunting dirges and candlelight ballads\" that he felt was among \"this year's prettiest local .\" A full-length debut record, Find Your Way Home, followed in 2007, which included a cover of Neutral Milk Hotel's \"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\". It was produced by Ben Durrant, who also worked on Andrew Bird's Armchair Apocrypha and Martin Dosh's The Lost Take, and would later join Roma di Luna as a full band member. Riemenschneider wrote that the album \"features a lot of eerie ambience and rustic instrumentation, which suits the hallowed-sounding songs.\"\n2008-11: Casting the Bones, Then The Morning Came, and breakup\nOver time, the group grew larger, becoming a seven-piece band by 2010. Its musical style also began to broaden, drawing in influences from soul, gospel, and rock as well as folk and blues, drawing comparisons to alt-country groups such as Cowboy Junkies and Calexico.\nThe group released their second album, Casting the Bones, in 2008. It was recorded in a single weekend. The songs began as spare arrangements for the duo, but were fleshed out into lusher versions by the full band, such redoing as the older song \"These Tears Ain\u2019t Mine\" in a more R&B-inflected arrangement. The band also tackled political material on songs like \"Pearls for Pigs\", which was about the history of the American Indian Movement. Riemenschneider named Casting the Bones one of the best albums of 2008, praising the \"intimate, evocative songs\" and Leaneagh's \"serene, siren-like singing\".\nThe band followed Bones with the limited-release EP Home Recordings later in 2008 and the holiday EP Christmas in 2009.\nThe band's third album, Then The Morning Came, was released in 2010, after a delay caused by several of the band members (including Casselle and Leaneagh) taking a break to have children. Thematically, the album dealt with not only new life and parenthood, but the loss and grief from the recent deaths of close friends and family members. Ross Raihala of the St. Paul Pioneer Press praised the album's diverse sound, saying that it \"uses dusty Americana as a base and adds blues and soul to the mix to create alluring, highly dramatic music.\" The album was also named No. 5 in a list of the top 10 Minnesota records of 2010 in the Star Tribune's annual survey of Twin Cities music critics, which called it \"a truly soul-searching batch of powerful songs.\"\nCasselle and Leaneagh divorced in 2011, also ending Roma di Luna. The band's last performance before breaking up was at the 2011 festival SoundTown in Somerset, Wisconsin. Alexei Casselle did not perform with the group.

First known as the settlement of Beaver Creek, it became Glendale, and finally Penrose.\nSettlement\nSettlers followed the Pike's Peak gold rush (July 1858 and lasted until the creation of the Territory of Colorado on February 28, 1861). Farmers were incentivized by the Homestead Act to come to the area. It was known as the Beaver Creek settlement initially, with a post office there by 1868. Then, the settlement became known as Glendale. In 1870, 22 families lived in the community, and more in 1880.\nStage coach station and hotel\nA stage coach stop was established along Beaver Creek, on a stage road from Old Colorado City.

It is also known as the Glendale Inn Stage Coach Stop and Glendale House and Stagecoach Inn. It had a restaurant, orchards, and a garden. Corrals held 1,000 horses and mules for the stage line. The stage coach road was built by William McClelland and Bob Spotswood. The stage delivered up to 100 people per day, food, supplies, and the mail. Trappers and scouts stopped by. Cowboys and Native Americans on cattle drives from Texas camped nearby.\nIn 1869, the business was renamed Glendale House and, operated by its new owner Rev. John Jeffries, and by 1874, it took in boarders. Church gatherings, parties, and weddings were held there.\nGlendale school\nThe Glendale School was established, the first in the Penrose area, in a log cabin in 1868. It was rebuilt in stone in 1873 after a fire. The schoolhouse was used for community functions, like pot luck dinners. It was used as a school until 1912, when a school was built in Penrose. Only the stone foundation remains.\nEarly 20th century\nSpencer Penrose began buying up water rights by 1909. The settlement was abandoned after the flood of Red Creek and Beaver Creek on July 3, 1921. Most of the stone walls of the hotel and stage coach stop remain, but the roof and porches were burned in a fire.\nLegend\nA woman and a man, Kathleen Cooper and Julian LaSalle, a miner from Leadville were to be married at the Glendale State Stop. LaSalle was just a few miles from Glendale when he was robbed and killed for his gold. Cooper, daughter of a rancher, waited in a bridal dress and veil. Wedding attendees also awaited LaSalle at the stop. Cooper died about one year later of influenza. The site of their planned wedding is reported to be haunted since then.\n",

    "Temple in K\u014dfu, Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan\nThe Main Hall\nZenk\u014d-ji (\u5584\u5149\u5bfa), or, to distinguish it from temples with the same name, Kai Zenk\u014d-ji (\u7532\u6590\u5584\u5149\u5bfa), with the mountain name J\u014dgaku-zan (\u5b9a\u984d\u5c71) is a temple of the J\u014ddo-sh\u016b sect located in K\u014dfu, Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan.\nHistory\nWhen Takeda Shingen got into trouble in the war with Uesugi Kenshin, he brought the temple treasures of Zenk\u014d-ji in Nagano to this area and built a new temple of the same name in 1558. After 6 years of construction, the first buildings were finished in 1565, and by 1568 the temple complex had taken shape. After Shingen's death in 1573, the temple was not fully completed and the temple treasures were not preserved. The main figure became a standing Buddha (\u524d\u7acb\u4ecf Maedachi-butsu ), and the temple became the head of the J\u014ddo-sh\u016b sect in the province. The Tokugawa clan also supported the temple during the Edo Period.\nIn 1754, most of the complex burned down, but was rebuilt in the architectural style of the era by 1796. In 1937, it was incorporated into the city of K\u014dfu.\nGate\nThe Main Gate\nThe main gate (\u5c71\u9580 Sanmon) to the temple grounds is designed as a two-story r\u014dmon. It is 16.88 m wide, 6.758 m deep and 15 m high, with a roof width of 22.9 m. It is designed in a mixed style of Japanese and Chinese elements. The two guardian figures (\u4ec1\u738bNi\u014d ) are distributed to the right and left below. The gate is registered as an important cultural asset of Japan .\nThe current main hall (\u91d1\u5802 Kond\u014d ) was completed in 1796 after thirty years of construction. It is 23 m wide, 38 m deep and 26 m high, making it one of the larger temple buildings in Japan. The building is similar in depth to the original Zenko-ji and has the same Shumoku-style roof (\u649e\u6728\u9020\u308a-zukuri ). The main hall, like the gate, is registered as an Important Cultural Property.\nTreasures\nIn the main hall, in a shrine (\u53a8\u5b50 Zushi) on the altar, there is the main figure, an Amida Buddha made of bronze, protected by an attendant on either side. The Buddha is unusually tall at 1.42 m. An inscription states that it dates from 1195. In the hall there are two more Amida with attendants, which are also registered as important cultural assets.\nOther treasures include a temple bell (\u68b5\u9418 Bonsh\u014d ) from 1313 and a picture of Minamoto no Yoritomo from 1336.\n",

She holds the world record for being the oldest person to play international cricket.\nBiography\nBorn in London and raised in Ilford, Barton credits her parents - from Yorkshire and Lancashire - and her twin brother for fostering an early interest in cricket.\nWhile at school she represented Essex in junior cricket and Kent Invicta ladies. She also played as wicket-keeper for Nottingham University men's 3rd XI during her student days.\nBarton's cricketing exploits were put on hold when she spent 10 years working as a \nChristian missionary in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1990s before returning to England.\nWhile teaching at the London School of Economics, she resumed playing cricket, turning out for the Heronettes in Wanstead.\nBarton moved to Gibraltar in 2020 after her husband, Ian Tarrant, an Anglican priest, was appointed Dean of Gibraltar and she began playing regularly in the men's domestic league on the British Overseas Territory.

She became world famous in the early 1960s. She gained great fame in Paris, where she was called \"the most beautiful weapon of the Kremlin\". She was also known by the nickname \"the Soviet Sophia Loren\".\nBiography\nThere are two versions regarding the place of birth of Zbarskaya and her parents. Those who knew Zbarskaya personally claimed that she was born in Vologda, where her mother, Daria Tikhonovna Kolesnikova, worked as a doctor, and her father, Nikolai Dementievich Kolesnikov, was a retired officer.\nIn 1953, seventeen-year-old Regina Kolesnikova came to Moscow and entered the Faculty of Economics at Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. While studying, she began to appear at bohemian parties, where one day she was noticed by fashion designer Vera Aralova. It was from this meeting that Kolesnikova's modeling career began. The French magazine Paris Match called her \"the most beautiful weapon of the Kremlin\". And when Vyacheslav Zaitsev cut Zbarskaya's pageboy hair and created the image of an \u201cItalian beauty,\u201d Zbarskaya was dubbed the \u201cSoviet Sophia Loren\u201d in the Western press\nIn 1958, she starred in the film The Sailor from the Comet (Russian: \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u0441 \u00ab\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044b\u00bb) as the Italian singer Silvanna (credited as R. Kolesnikova).\nZbarskaya's only husband was the Moscow artist Lev Zbarsky, the son of the scientist Boris Zbarsky, the marriage took place in the early 1960s. In 1967, Zbarskaya became pregnant, but her husband did not want children, she decided to have an abortion, after which she tried to suppress her feelings of guilt with antidepressants. At this time, Zbarsky became interested in actress Marianna Vertinskaya, and then went to Lyudmila Maksakova, who gave birth to his son in 1970. After this, Zbarskaya was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with signs of severe depression.\nSoviet illegal intelligence officer Vitaly Shlykov claimed in an interview that he lived with Zbarskaya for one year in her apartment, and during the period when she was still officially married, but no longer lived with her husband. It was during this period that one of Zbarskaya's suicide attempts occurred by cutting herself with nail scissors. Shlykov named the main reason for the suicide attempt as severe stress after an attempt to recruit the model by KGB officers through blackmail. Also in his memoirs, he categorically rejected the speculation that he encountered in various sources that Zbarskaya worked for the KGB, helping to collect the necessary data for this department in various ways.\nAfter leaving the hospital, Zbarskaya, with the help of the deputy director of the Model House, Elena Stepanovna Vorobey, returned to the podium. She began dating a young Yugoslav journalist who used her to achieve his own fame. Soon, under his authorship, a book was published in German, \u201cOne Hundred Nights with Regina Zbarskaya,\u201d which describes erotic scenes, and also contains information about Zbarskaya's alleged connections with members of the Central Committee and denunciations of other fashion models.\nAfter the political scandal, Zbarskaya tried to commit suicide three times; she succeeded on the third attempt and died from sleeping pills poisoning on November 15, 1987, at the age of 52.\nThere is also a version that Regina Zbarskaya died at home and not in the hospital. According to this version, she was found dead in the apartment with a telephone receiver in her hands. Colleagues from the House of Models (Russian: \u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u043e\u044e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u044b) did not come to her funeral; her body was cremated. The circumstances of her death remain mysterious, and her burial place remains unknown. According to one version, she was buried in Vologda next to her father and aunt.\nVyacheslav Zaitsev in an interview with Ogoniok magazine said about her:\nRegina Zbarskaya was not just a stunning beauty, but also smart. She has a tragic fate. But I always adored her. I took her to the House of Models as a \u201ctype figure\u201d - a fashion model on whom they did fittings. She also worked simply as a cleaner. I supported her in every possible way until the very end.\nHer character was played by Ksenia Lukyanchikova at the serial The Red Queen.\n",

It is bundled with the 2024 rerelease of Sonic Generations (2011) and players can switch between both games at will. Shadow Generations's story takes place during the events of Sonic Generations. It follows Shadow the Hedgehog as he faces his archenemy, the alien Black Doom, who has returned following his defeat in Shadow the Hedgehog (2005) and plots to take over the world.\nShadow Generations's levels, like those in Sonic Generations, are drawn from previous Sonic games, such as Sonic Adventure 2 (2001), Sonic Heroes (2003), Shadow the Hedgehog, and Sonic the Hedgehog (2006). Shadow serves as the player character and controls similarly to Sonic, but can use his \"Chaos Control\" power to freeze objects and access alternate paths. Unlike Sonic Generations' side-scrolling hub world, the hub world in Shadow Generations is 3D and features open-world gameplay similar to that of Sonic Frontiers (2022).\nDevelopment\nShadow Generations is part of the Year of Shadow, a Sonic the Hedgehog marketing campaign centering around Shadow-themed content. Katsuyuki Shigihara, one of Sonic Generations's designers, directed Shadow Generations, and other Sonic Team members who worked on Generations contributed. Sonic's producer Takashi Iizuka said that like Sonic Generations, Sonic Team chose to revisit levels from past Sonic games to recall Shadow's history. They chose levels they found the most interesting and the most popular among fans, while integrating Sonic Frontiers's open-world gameplay to add modern elements.\nRelease\nSega announced Shadow Generations on January 31, 2024, during one of PlayStation's State of Play livesteams.

    "\nRobert Zotoumbat (born September 19, 1944, in M\u00e9kambo, Gabon; died April 22, 2017, in Libreville) was a Gabonese writer, often regarded as either the first Gabonese novelist or a precursor of Gabonese novels.\nBiography\nRobert Zotoumbat was born on September 19, 1944, in M\u00e9kambo, Gabon. After completing his studies, he became an English teacher and later took on administrative roles within private Protestant education as the director of secondary education. In 1971, he published Histoire d'un enfant trouv\u00e9. This 58-page autobiographical account tells the story of Ngoye, a child orphaned by famine in 1905. As a \"moana-wa-za,\" or \"child of the famine,\" Ngoye is adopted by a wealthy merchant, Mboula, but is mistreated by Mboula's wife, who acts like a wicked stepmother. Ngoye embarks on a quest to learn about his origins. Histoire d'un enfant trouv\u00e9 is frequently considered the first Gabonese novel by some specialists in African literary history and the media. Robert Zotoumbat passed away in 2017. Jean-L\u00e9onard Ngu\u00e9ma Ondo, in an article on the history of the Gabonese novel, refers to him as \"the precursor of the Gabonese novel and its successors from the 1980s generation.\"\nWork\nThe literary genre of Histoire d'un enfant trouv\u00e9 is subject to debate, with several specialists disputing its status as a novel. Ludovic Emane Obiang notes that the text vacillates between the genre of a short story and a tale but considers that, despite its weaknesses, it is the first Gabonese text resembling a novel. Ngu\u00e9ma Ondo argues that the text uses more techniques from the tale genre.\nWorks\n1971: Histoire d'un enfant trouv\u00e9. Yaound\u00e9, \u00c9ditions CLE.

    "2024 rugby union competition in New Zealand\nThe 2024 Bunnings NPC season is the nineteenth season of New Zealand's provincial rugby union competition, the National Provincial Championship, since it turned professional in 2006. It involves the top fourteen provincial rugby unions of New Zealand. For sponsorship reasons, the competition is known as the Bunnings NPC. The regular season begins on Friday 9 August 2024, when 2023 Champions Taranaki host Counties Manukau. The Final is scheduled for Saturday 26 October 2024.\nFormat\nUnder the current competition format, which is a continuation of that of 2023, the 14 provincial unions participating in the Bunnings NPC are grouped in one single division, ranked on one single competition table and play for one NPC title.\nAll provincial teams play ten games during the regular season (round robin): five games are played at the provincial union's home ground and five games are away games. The seven teams that finished the previous season in 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th place will play each other as well as four cross-over matches against the teams that finished 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th and 14th. Likewise, the teams that finished 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th and 14th will also play each other as well as four cross-over games against the provinces that were ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th or 13th at the end of the previous season. The ten round robin games in 2024 are played over a period of nine weeks (starting on Friday 9 August 2024) and include one mid-week game to be played on a Wednesday night.\nThe regular season is followed by quarter-finals to be played by the eight highest ranked teams on the competition table. The finals rankings are determined by the number of competition points earned during the regular season. Competition points can be gained in the following way: four points are awarded to the winning team, two points to each team for a draw, and no points for a loss. Teams can also receive a bonus point if they score four or more tries in a match, or lose by seven points or less.\nIf two or more provincial teams finish with an equal number of competition points, the following tiebreaker rules apply. If two unions are tied, the union which has defeated the other in a head-to-head is placed higher. In case of a draw between them, the side with the biggest points difference is ranked higher. If three or more unions are tied and they have all played each other, the team with most competition points in that year against the other tied unions is ranked higher; if they have not all played each other, the team with the biggest points difference in the round robin is ranked higher. In all cases, if these unions are still tied, the ranking is decided by the highest number of tries scored, the most points scored, or a coin toss.\nThe quarter-finals are played as follows, with the highest ranked team hosting:\nQF 1: 1 v 8;\nQF 2: 2 v 7;\nQF 3: 3 v 6; and\nQF 4: 4 v 5.\nIn the semi-finals, the highest-ranked quarter-final winner hosts the lowest-ranked quarter-final winner and the second highest-ranked quarter-final winner hosts the third highest-ranked quarter-final winner.\nThe NPC Final will be played between the two semi-final winners, again at the home venue of the team with the higher finals ranking.\nThe rules governing Ranfurly Shield Challenges state that every home game during the regular season played by the union that holds the Ranfurly Shield is a mandartory challenge match. No challenge matches will be played after the regular season has ended (i.e., during the finals). A holder who competes in the Bunnings NPC must also accept at least two challenges from unions competing in the Heartland Championship, including a challenge lodged by the winner of the Meads Cup at the end of the previous season. These non-mandatory challenge matches must be played before the start of the NPC season.\nStandings\nThe current standings for the 2024 Bunnings NPC season are:\nFirst match(es) will be played: Friday 9 August 2024.

    "\nTelevision channel\nHorizon Pacific Television was a network of four regional television stations operated by Television New Zealand from 1995 to 1997, with services in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Dunedin on the UHF band. The service carried a mix of local programmes and relays of BBC World. It was later shut down and replaced by a time-shifted feed of MTV Europe with local inserts.\nHistory\nHorizon Pacific Television started on 19 March 1995 (Sunday) at 3pm as part of a diversification of TVNZ's business units post-deregulation. It was created following criticisms regarding the lack of regional programming on TVNZ's channels, and competed against established local services such as Max TV, Mainland Television and Eastland Television.\nThe network was composed of the following stations:\nATV (Auckland)\nCoast to Coast (Hamilton)\nCapital City Television (Wellington)\nSouthern Television (Dunedin)\nThese stations were joined by a fifth, Christchurch's Canterbury Television, which was an independent television station, in November 1995.\nIn 1997, Television New Zealand announced that it was going to withdraw the operations of Horizon Pacific due to a lack of financial sustainability to continue. TVNZ replaced it with MTV, which was seen as a more \"competitive\" alternative. MTV would eventually become unprofitable and shut down less than a year later.\nThe shutdown led to redundancies at TVNZ, some of which were compensated for gaining new jobs at TVNZ's news and current affairs division.\nProgramming\nAt launch, Horizon Pacific carried news bulletins from BBC World, documentaries, drama series (such as Hill Street Blues), lifestyle and musical programming, as well as local programmes. From its launch day, BBC World began being carried overnight on TV One instead of closing down.\nAlthough the channel pledged \"regional public service television\", critics of the service called the supposed statement of the service as an \"oxymoron\" due to the abundance of foreign content.\nAfter closing, its imported output moved to TV One.\n",
    "American athlete (1897\u20131980)\nAlexander Harvey Bright (December 16, 1897 \u2013 November 17, 1980) was an American stockbroker and athlete who played college and semipro hockey and was a member of the 1936 United States Olympic ski team.\nEarly life\nBright was born on December 16, 1897, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His parents were Elmer H. and Mary (Bill) Bright and he was a descendant of John Stark. He attended the Browne & Nichols School and Harvard College.\nHockey\nBright was a standout player for the Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey team. His hockey career was interrupted by World War I, during which time he served as a second lieutenant in the infantry, but did not serve outside the United States. After graduating from Harvard in 1919, Bright played amateur in Boston. He was a member of the Harvard Club during the 1919\u201320 season. The team folded at the end of the season and Bright and three of his teammates joined the Boston Athletic Association ice hockey team. He returned to the B.A.A. team for the 1921\u201322 season and from 1922 to 1924 he played for the Boston Hockey Club.\nBusiness career\nIn 1924, Bright and his brother, Horace, joined their father's stock brokerage firm \u2013 Elmer H. Bright & Co. In 1959, the firm merged with Tucker, Anthony & R. L. Day and was a limited partner with that company until his retirement in 1975.\nSkiing\nBright was a founding member of the Ski Club Hochgebirge and the Woodstock Ski Runners Club. After seeing Europe's tramways during the 1933 FIS championships, Bright lobbied the American Steel and Wire Company to construct the first aerial tramway in North America at the Cannon Mountain Ski Area. His efforts were successful and on June 17, 1938, the Cannon Mountain Tramway opened to the public.\nBright was a member of the 1936 United States Olympic ski team and competed in the Olympic trials. In 1951, he won the Eastern amateur senior giant slalom championship.\nBright was on the selection committees for the 1940, 1948, and 1952 U.S. Olympic ski teams. He also served a vice president of the National Ski Association and was responsible for many changes in the sport's rules and regulations. He was inducted into the National Ski Hall of Fame in 1959.\nAviation\nBright received his pilot's license in 1927. In 1942, he was appointed to the Massachusetts Aeronautics Commission by Governor Leverett Saltonstall. That May, Bright was commissioned a captain in the United States Army Air Forces. He served as an intelligence officer with the 91st Bombardment Squadron and was a spare gunner on a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress during the Allied bombing of the Lorient Submarine Base.\nBright-Landry Hockey Center\nWith possibility that the Boston Arena would no longer be available for college hockey, Bright led a fundraising drive for a new Harvard hockey rink and donated $20,288 towards the cause. In 1978, Bright financed renovations to the rink, which was renamed the Alexander H. Bright Hockey Center on November 19, 1979. In 2013, the arena was renamed the Bright-Landry Hockey Center in recognition of supporter C. Kevin Landry.\nPersonal life and death\nIn 1959, Bright married Clarita Heath, a fellow member of the 1936 United States Olympic ski team. They had one son and two daughters and resided in Brookline, Massachusetts. Bright died on November 17, 1980, at a nursing home in Waltham, Massachusetts.\n",
    "\nShurahbil (Arabic: \u0634\u0631\u062d\u0628\u064a\u0644, romanized:\u00a0Shura\u1e25b\u012bl) is an Arab male given name of Syriac and Aramaic origin. Alternative spellings of this name include Sharhabil, Sharhabeel, Charhabil, Cherhabil and Shurihbi'il.\nLexicology and meaning\nThe meaning of the name Shurahbil is generally unknown. According to the Muslim lexicographer Ibn Duraid, the name Shurahbil is not of native Arab origin, rather it is derived from Syriac. Ibn al-Kalbi states that every name with \"il\" at the back means something that is from El, which is Aramaic for God (Allah). Muslim scholar Ibn Abbas compares the name with other names of Aramaic origin like Ismail (derived from Ishmael) and Israfil (derived from Raphael). The name is also said to be of Indian origin with links to the word Shura which is another name for the Hindu god, Shiva. A Mandaean female version of the name, Sharhabeil, exists as well.\nTransliterations and popularity\nThe name Shurahbil is also transliterated as Sharhabil or Sharhabeel. It also has the alternative spellings Charhabil and Cherhabil. An ancient version of this name, Shurihbi'il, appears in inscriptions from the Himyarite Kingdom of Yemen. The name is most common in Nigeria, Morocco and Malaysia.\nPeople with the given name\nShurahbil\nShurahbil ibn Hasana (died 639 CE) one of the earliest converts to Islam and a companion of Muhammad, as well as a key military commander for the Rashidun Caliphate\nShurahbil ibn Simt, 7th-century South Arabian Muslim warrior and military commander from the tribe of Kinda\nSharhabil\nSharhabeil, a saint of the faith of Mandaeism\nSharhabil Ya'fur (died c.\u2009465 CE) a Himyarite king who ruled in the 5th century CE\nSharhabil Yakkuf (died c.\u2009480 CE) a Himyarite king who founded a new ruling dynasty in the 5th century CE and persecuted Christians in his realm\nSharhabil Ahmed, musician from Omdurman, Sudan\nPeople with the surname\nSharhabil\nYusuf ibn Sharhabil (died c.\u2009530 CE) a Jewish ruler of the Himyarite kingdom who was well known for his persecutions of Christians throughout his realm and an infamous role in both Islamic and Christian traditions\nAyyub ibn Sharhabil, 8th-century Umayyad governor of Egypt\nCherhabil\nHocine Cherhabil, former Minister of Digitization and Statistics in Algeria\nSee also\nAll pages with titles beginning with Shurahbil\nAll pages with titles containing Sharhabil\nAll pages with titles containing Cherhabil\n",
    "American biochemist and organic geochemist (1936\u20132010)\nJohn Read Cronin  (August 3, 1936 \u2013 June 30, 2010) was an American biochemist and organic geochemist renowned for his pioneering research in the field of meteoritic organic chemistry. His work significantly advanced the understanding of the role of extraterrestrial organic molecules in the origin of life.\nEarly life\nJohn Read Cronin was born on August 3, 1936, in Marietta, Ohio. He grew up in New Philadelphia, Ohio, where he developed an early interest in science and nature. Cronin's fascination with chemistry and the natural world led him to pursue a career in biochemistry.\nEducation\nCronin attended The College of Wooster, where he obtained his undergraduate degree in chemistry. He then went on to earn a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. His doctoral research laid the foundation for his later work in organic chemistry and prebiotic chemistry.\nCareer\nIn 1966, Cronin joined the faculty at Arizona State University (ASU) as a professor of biochemistry. At ASU, he became involved in the emerging field of exobiology, focusing on the study of organic materials in extraterrestrial environments. His work at the ASU Center for Meteorite Studies, particularly with carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, positioned him as a leading figure in the field.\nCronin's research explored the organic chemistry of meteorites, with a specific focus on carbonaceous chondrites like the Murchison meteorite. His work provided valuable insights into the diversity and complexity of extraterrestrial organic compounds and their potential role in the origin of life on Earth. John worked closely with Sandra Pizzarello with whom he made a number of important discoveries and collaborated extensively.\nThe meteorite center explained the significance of Cronin's findings and contributions. As the world consensus at the time was skeptical about the presence of amino acids in meteorites, John Cronin and his colleagues  conducted independent tests using different analytical techniques to detect amino acids in various meteorites, including Murchison, Murray, and Allende. Their findings showed that:\n Murchison and Murray contained amino acids, while\nAllende did not, proving that contamination wasn't an issue.\nThis led Cronin and his team to further study the organics present in meteorites. They identified various compounds, including carboxylic acids, complex amino acids, and aliphatic hydrocarbons also using nuclear magnetic resonance.\nThe team also collaborated with  Samuel Epstein from Caltech to examine the isotopic signatures of organic molecules in meteorites, which further supported their  extraterrestrial origin.  Cronin and Sandra Pizzarello discovered the  asymmetry of organic molecules  before they fell to Earth, which might have originated from the interstellar medium. This research is significant because the exclusively left-handed nature of life's molecules is essential for the structures and functions of terrestrial biopolymers and is assumed to be crucial for the  emergence of life.\nResearch Contributions\nOrganic Compounds in Meteorites\nCronin's extensive analysis of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites revealed a rich diversity of organic molecules, including amino acids, hydrocarbons, and nucleobases. His research demonstrated that these meteorites contain complex organic compounds that could have been significant in prebiotic chemistry.\nKey Publication:\nCronin, John R.; Chang, Sherwood (1993). \"Organic Matter in Meteorites: Molecular and Isotopic Analyses of the Murchison Meteorite\".

    "Military unit\nThe 12th Mississippi Infantry Regiment was a Confederate infantry regiment from Mississippi. As part of the Army of Northern Virginia, the 12th Mississippi fought in many battles of the Eastern theater of the American Civil War before surrendering in April 1865. \nHistory\nJoseph C. White, of the 12th Mississippi Infantry, photographed at Corinth, Mississippi, c.1861\nThe companies of the 12th Regiment were organized in the spring of 1861, initially for state service. The Regiment was sent to Virginia in July, with an original strength of 1,013 men. The 12th arrived too late to participate in the First Battle of Bull Run, and spent the remainder of the year in camp. The 12th's colonel, Richard Griffith was promoted to brigadier general in November and given command of a brigade of Mississippi regiments. Griffith had previously served in the Mexican-American War alongside Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The 12th did not see combat until 1862, when it fought in the Battle of Seven Pines, losing 41 killed and 152 wounded. As part of General Winfield S. Featherston's brigade, the 12th fought in the Seven Days Battles, where Richard Griffith was mortally wounded on June 29.\nThe Regiment took part in the Second Manassas Campaign, the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Fredericksburg. The 12th took so many casulaties in these battles that Col. William H. Taylor wrote to the governor of Mississippi the day after Antietam asking for conscripts to replinish the ranks: \"My Regiment has Suffered Severely in Evry  Engagement it has been in and at this time does not number One Hundred effective men for Battle So reduced is it by Deaths Discharges and wounds...I am very much afraid if I can not get the Conscripts my Regiment will be disbanded.\"\nAs part of General Carnot Posey's brigade, the 12th fought at Chancellorsville, where Col. Merry B. Harris was severly wounded. During the Battle of Gettysburg, the 12th Regiment was held in reserve and did not see much fighting. After the retreat from Pennsylvania, the regiment fought at Bristoe Station, where brigade commander Carnot Posey was killed, and Mine Run before spending the winter in Virginia.\nIn 1864, during the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse, the 12th Mississippi took part in some of the bloodiest and most intense combat of the war, at the location known as the \"Bloody Angle\". This location was the site of some of the fiercest combat of the civil war, as Union and Confederate troops made desperate attacks and counter-attacks over nearly 24 hours of continuous battle. General Nathaniel H. Harris, commanding a Mississippi brigade that included the 12th Regiment, described the intensity of the battle his troops were engaged in: \"Thus from 7 a.m. of the 12th to 3.30 a.m. on May 13 (twenty hours) my men were exposed to a constant and destructive fire, both from front and flank, and during the hours of day to a heavy artillery fire, in which mortars were used by the enemy for the first time during the campaign. A cold, drenching rain fell during the greater portion of the day and night and the trenches were filled with water. Great difficulty was experienced in procuring supplies of ammunition, man after man being shot down while bringing it in... As an instance of the terrible nature of the fire, trees 22 inches in diameter were hewn to splinters and felled by the musketry.\"\nThe regiment was sent to defend Petersburg, Virginia, and was engaged in several battles on the defensive lines. Col. Merry B. Harris was hit by sniper fire in the Petersburg trenches and was permanently disabled. In the Battle of Globe Tavern, more than 100 men from the 12th and 16th Mississippi were captured, including Colonel S.B. Thomas of the 12th. During the final stages of the Siege of Petersburg, the 12th was assigned to hold Fort Gregg, and took part in brutal hand-to-hand fighting during the Federal breakthrough on April 2. The survivors were captured, although at least some men of the 12th escaped the fall of Petersburg and were present at the final surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.\nNotable members\nWilliam M.

    "\nWilliam A. Link is an American historian, academic and author. He is a Richard J. Milbauer Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Florida.\nLink is most known for his works on the history of the American South. Among his sole-authored works are his publications in academic journals, including the Journal of Southern History, as well as books such as A Hard Country and a Lonely Place: Schooling, Society and Reform in Rural Virginia (1986), The Paradox of Southern Progressivism (1992), Southern Crucible: The Making of the American South (2015) and The Last Fire-Eater: Roger A. Pryor and the Search for a Southern Identity (2022).\nEducation\nLink earned his B.A. in History from Davidson College in 1976, subsequently completing an M.A. in American History at the University of Virginia in 1979. He then pursued his PhD in American History at the same institution, completing it in 1981.\nCareer\nAt the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, he initially served as an assistant professor of history from 1981 to 1986, followed by appointments as an associate professor (1986 to 1992), and subsequently professor of history (1993\u20131999) and Lucy Spinks Keker Excellence Professor (1999\u20132004). Concurrently, he held positions as associate dean of UNCG's College of Arts and Sciences (1995\u20131998) and head of the Department of History (1998\u20132004). Moreover, between 2004 and 2022, he held the position of Richard J. Milbauer Professor of History at the University of Florida.\nWorks\nLink has authored various books throughout his career. In 1986, he authored A Hard Country and a Lonely Place: Schooling, Society, and Reform in Rural Virginia. The book examined the transformation of Virginia's rural schools between 1870 and 1920, emphasizing the impact of localism on education expansion initially, and later, the clash between urban reformers and local communities, resulting in significant changes in governance, curriculum, and the imposition of segregated pedagogy. His 1993 book The Paradox of Southern Progressivism, 1880\u20131930 explored the cultural conflicts between social reformers and rural communities in the American South during the Progressive Era, highlighting how differing values and approaches ultimately hindered the success of progressive reforms. Through his 2003 book Roots of Secession: Slavery and Politics in Antebellum Virginia he offered a fresh perspective on the politics of secession in antebellum Virginia, highlighting the significant role of African Americans, both enslaved and free, in shaping the state's political landscape and contributing to the onset of the Civil War.\nLink, in his book North Carolina: Change and Tradition in Southern State (2009; 2nd edition, 2018) provided a comprehensive exploration of North Carolina's history, tracing its evolution from pre-contact times to the 2008 elections, highlighting the interplay between traditionalism, class, race, gender dynamics, and modernization, offering insight into the state's past and future. The book was reviewed by L. Scott Philyaw, who is a faculty member at Western Carolina University. In his review of the book, he said \"Bill Link has written a valuable contribution for college-level classes in North Carolina history. His well-written text is balanced in terms of chronology and topic selection. North Carolina: Change and Tradition in a Southern State is a significant and welcome addition to current North Carolina history texts\". His 2013 book Atlanta, Cradle of the New South: Race and Remembering in the Civil War's Aftermath explored the significance of the Civil War and its aftermath, focusing on Atlanta as a pivotal city where the destruction, rebuilding, and struggles for power and identity shaped the transition from the Old South to the New South for both white and African American populations.\nIn his 2015 publication Southern Crucible: The Making of the American South, Link examined the American South's history, presenting a balanced narrative of its social, political, cultural, and economic evolution over four centuries. His later work included a biography exploring the multifaceted life of Roger A. Pryor, a prominent figure in the American South whose journey from fervent secessionist to post-war reconciler reflects the broader transformations of the region during the 19th century. The book was reviewed by Brianna Frakes, who said \"In The Last Fire-Eater, renowned historian William A. Link brings readers into the world of Roger A. Pryor, a man whose life Link argues is emblematic of the American South's transformation during the Civil War era.\" She further commended the book for focusing significantly on how Pryor had to adapt to the profound transformations brought about by the Civil War and its aftermath, despite not being a comprehensive biography of his entire life. In addition to books, he has authored a variety of publications, encompassing book reviews and articles.\nAwards and honors\n1993, 1995 \u2013 North Carolina Mayflower Award, S",

    "Canadian historian\nTrevor Harvey Levere FRSC (1944\u20132022) was an English-born, Canadian historian of science, specializing in the history of chemistry. He was the author of six books and the coauthor of three books.\nBiography\nAfter graduating from St Paul's School, London, Levere matriculated in 1962 at the University of Oxford. As an undergraduate, he enjoyed reading about the history of science as presented in the work of Herbert Butterfield, Henry Leicester, and Thomas Kuhn. Levere received his B.A. in chemistry in 1966. His Part II B.A. thesis on an historical topic in chemistry eventually appeared as a chapter in the 1969 book Martinus van Marum. Life and Work, edited by R. J. Forbes. At Oxford, Levered graduated in 1969 with a Ph.D. in the history of science. His thesis supervisor was A. C. Crombie. Levere's Ph.D. thesis, published in 1971 with the title Affinity and Matter: Elements of Chemical Philosophy 1800\u20131865, remains an important reference for historians of chemistry.\nAt the Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology (IHPST) and the Department of History of the University of Toronto, Levere was employed as Lecturer from 1968 to 1969, Assistant Professor from 1969 to 1974, Associate Professor from 1974 to 1981, Professor from 1981 to 2006, and University Professor from 2006 to 2007, when he retired as University Professor Emeritus. He helped to develop the IHPST (founded in 1967) into an internationally important organization and served as the IHPST's director from 1981 to 1986 and again from 1993 to 1998. In addition to the history of chemistry, Levere did research on the relation between science and Romanticism, the history of science in Canada, and the history of arctic exploration. He published more than 80 refereed articles or book chapters. His book Transforming Matter: A History of Chemistry from Alchemy to the Buckyball (2001, Johns Hopkins University Press) was written for chemistry students and teachers interested in the history of chemistry, as well as anyone else interested in the history of chemistry. The book was translated into Japanese and published in 2007 with the support of the Japanese Society for the History of Chemistry. Transforming Matter is noteworthy for its \"readable style\" and, according to David M. Knight, is \"amazingly full of information.\"\nLevere was the editor or co-editor of several books. He served in various editorial capacities for several journals \u2014 most notably at the editor from 1999 to 2013 of the journal Annals of Science. He held Visiting Fellowships in France (1981, Centre national de recherch\u00e9 scientifique, Paris), in the UK (1983, Clare Hall, Cambridge); in the USA (1995, Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology, MIT); and in Spain (2006, Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona). He also held short-term fellowships in Japan (2004, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) and in Germany (2006 & 2007, University of G\u00f6ttingen).\nTrevor Levere married Jennifer Tiesing on the 30th of July 1966. Upon his death in 2022, he was survived by his widow Jennifer, their son and daughter, and five grandchildren.\nAwards and honours\nLevere was a Killam Senior Research Fellow from 1975 to 1977.

    "Municipal building in St Just in Penwith, Cornwall, England\nThe Old Town Hall is a former municipal building on Chapel Road in St Just in Penwith, a town in Cornwall, in England. The building, which was in municipal use for much of the 20th century, is now managed as a community venue.\nHistory\nThe roundel in the gable\nThe building was commissioned as a drill hall for the 1st Cornwall (Duke of Cornwall's) Artillery Volunteers, which was raised in Cornwall in response to the threat of a French invasion. It consisted of thirteen Artillery Volunteer Corps and the last numbered of these was the 13th (St Just) Cornwall Artillery Volunteer Corps, which was raised in St Just in Penwith on 26 September 1862.\nThe drill hall was designed in the Victorian Free style, built in local granite and was completed in late 1862. The design involved a canted main frontage at the southwest corner of the building. The frontage was fenestrated with a Diocletian window on the ground floor and a single casement window on the first floor. Above that, in the swept back section of the gable, there was a small roundel containing three artillery pieces surrounded by olive leaves and surmounted by the number \"13\", identifying the corps which it accommodated. The design of the Chapel Road frontage involved three bays fenestrated by cross-windows on both floors, while the side elevation of four bays was fenestrated in a similar style but with a doorway in the first bay. It was a substantial two-storey stone building, which has been described by the Drill Hall Project as \"of no great architectural merit\".\nThe 13th (St Just) Cornwall Artillery Volunteer Corps formed the guard of honour for a visit by the Prince and Princess of Wales to Botallack Mine in 1867. The unit was re-designated No. 10 Battery, Duke of Cornwall Artillery Volunteers in May 1880, but was then absorbed into No. 9 Battery at Marazion in 1883. During the First World War, the building was used as a drill hall for No. 2 Heavy Battery, Cornwall Royal Garrison Artillery \u2013 Defended Ports, which was responsible for coastal defence.\nThereafter, the War Office had no further use for the drill hall: it was deemed surplus to requirements and made available for community use, and became the offices and meeting place of St Just Urban District Council. It continued to serve as the local seat of government for much of the 20th century, and, following local government re-organisation in 1974, continued to be used by Penwith District Council as an office for the delivery of local services, and by St Just in Penwith Town Council as their meeting place. However, following the introduction of unitary authorities in 2009, Penwith District Council was abolished and, by 2010, the St Just in Penwith Town Council had relocated to new offices at No.1 Chapel Street, also known as \"Bank House\". Since then, the old town hall has been managed by St Just Community ABC as a community venue.\n",

    "Uzbek military commander, emir of Samarqand\nYalangto\u02bbsh Bahodir (Persian: \u067e\u0627\u0628\u0631\u0647\u0646\u0647 \u0642\u06cc\u0645\u062a \u0627\u0633\u062a) 1578, Bukhara, Bukhara Khanate - 1656, Samarkand, Bukhara Khanate), a major representative of the military-owning nobility during the Ashtarkhanid era. He belonged to the Olchin tribe of Uzbeks and served as the governor of Samarkand since 1626. Yalangtosh Bahadir was brought up under Bukhara Khan Abdulla Khan\nCorrect spelling of name\nIn the documents related to him, his name is written as Yalangtosh biy. The name of this commander in the form of Yalangtoshbi is found in written sources written both in the Bukhara Khanate and in the Safavid state.\nIn the historiography of the Russian Empire, he was called only Yalangtushbi. Brockhaus and Yefron named him \"Yalantush Bahadur\" in their encyclopedic dictionary.\nOnly the name Yalangtushbi is used in world oriental literature.\nThe name of Boykhoja's son Yalantash is engraved on the tombstone.\nThe name \"Yalantosh Bohodur\" is engraved in the modern Uzbek language on the stone tablet placed next to his grave.\nEducation\nYalangtush-biy was educated in Bukhara in a kuttab and madrasah during the reign of the Uzbek khan Abdullah Khan. According to written sources, Yalangtush-biy's career developed as follows: his father Boykhoji was an emir - one of the highest dignitaries of the Shibanid khans in Bukhara, so Yalangtush-biy was raised from childhood at the court of the Bukhara khans from the Shibanid dynasty. At school, Yalangtush-biy studied Persian. All legal documents drawn up on his behalf, including the inscription on one of the madrassas on Registan Square, are written in Persian.\nOrigin\nNalangtosh Bahadir was born in Bukhara.\nNalangtosh Bahadir was from the alchin (cherry) clan of Uzbeks. His father was called Boykhoji. His father and his son were students of Khoja Hashim Dahbetii, a descendant of the famous Naqshbandi Sufi leader Mahdumi Azam (1461-1542). Yalangtoshbi and his daughters: Iqlima bonu, Ayibibi were buried in the cemetery in Dahbet, under the feet of Khoja Hashim Dahbeti. According to the document of 1643, it was his literate son Boybek. But he died before his father, according to the document of 1650, he died.\nLiteracy and subsequent political activity\nIn Bukhara, he learned the science of management and military work very early. At this event, the mayor notices Yalangtosh's high intelligence for his age.\nYalangtosh knew the Persian-Tajik language very well. All legal documents drawn up in his name, as well as an inscription in one of the madrasas on Registan Square, are written in Persian-Tajik.\nAfter the death of Baqi Muhammad Khan janid dynasty in 1605, Yalangtosh first supported Vali Muhammad Khan, and then in 1611 he opposed him by supporting another Ashtarkhanid ruler, Imam Qulikhan. As a result, in 1612, the new khan appointed Yalangtosh as the amir (representative) of Samarkand, and later as the patriarch.\nHe owned large areas in various parts of Central Asia. For example, on April 30, 1650, a will was drawn up about \"buying 2/6 of a garden and 2/6 of land in Posarchak quarter of Shovdar district of Samarkand from Niyozbek and Khojibek, sons of Boyhojibi, son of Yalantoshboy Ashura Qushbegi, for 1000 coins.\".\nYalangtush and Abdulaziz Khan\nIn 1645, Abdulaziz Khan ascended the throne in Bukhara and, probably, Yalangtushbiy was again appointed khokim of Samarkand.\nIn 1646, Abdulaziz Khan came to the aid of the Kazakhs in the fight against the Dzungars.\nMilitary services\nIn 1611, he actively participated in the enthronement of Imam Qulikhan. After that, the position of Yalangtosh Bahadur increased, he began to rule Samarkand practically independently from 1626. He was given the title of father. Yalangtosh was Bahadur's own army, and as a result of his raids on the surrounding districts, he collected a lot of material resources. Yalangtosh Bahadir actively participated in all military operations of the Bukhara Khanate. For example, in 1623 and 1631, when the Iranian troops came to Balkh province, a large army led by Yalangtosh Bahadir came to the aid of the Governor of Balkh, Nadr Muhammad Khan.\nIn 1640, Imam Quli Khan sent a message to Moscow through ambassadors, stating that he was ready to send 12 amirs and a large army under the leadership of Yalangtosh Bahadur to fight the Russian state against the Kalmyks. In 1642, when Imam Quli Khan became blind, Yalangtosh Bahadir and other emirs brought Nadr Muhammad from Balkh and put him on the throne. Nadr Muhammed Yalangtosh gave Darai Suf region, Molgan, Kahmerd and the Tulchichi, Saiganchi, Zirangi, Kilachi, Hazaranikudari tribes around Kabul with their herbs in the form of iqta. In 1645, Yalangtosh Bahadir quarreled with Nadr Muhammad Khan in Bukhara and led the revolt of the emirs against the Khan in Khojand. The rebels marched to Bukhara, taking Sultan Abdulaziz, who was sent from Bukhara to suppress the rebellion, as a prisoner. In Oktepa region west of Bukhara, they proclaimed Abdulaziz Khan and then ",
    "Gabonese writer\nDieudonn\u00e9 Pascal Ndouna Okogo, known as Ndouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud, was a Gabonese writer, poet, playwright, educator, and diplomat, born on July 7, 1937, in Aki\u00e9ni, Haut-Ogoou\u00e9 province in the southeast of the country, and assassinated on July 19, 1977, in Libreville.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nHe completed part of his primary and secondary education in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. In 1955, he obtained his BEPC (Certificate of Primary Studies) in Libreville. That same year, he won a competition to join the Mitzic Normal School in northern Gabon. The following year, in 1956, he obtained his end-of-studies certificate. He was then assigned as an assistant teacher in Batouala in the Ogoou\u00e9-Ivindo province in northeastern Gabon. On January 1, 1958, the young teacher was confirmed in his position by the territorial administration.\nCareer\nDuring the 1960\u20131961 school year, he was appointed regional director of Makokou and a teacher at the general education college in the same city.\nFrom 1966 to 1968, he underwent training at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure d'Abidjan in Ivory Coast. In July 1968, upon his return to his country, he was appointed as a teacher in a general education college. In May 1972, he was appointed director of primary education concurrently with his teaching duties at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure and the National School of Administration in Libreville.\nIn September 1972, he embarked on a diplomatic career. He was appointed first counselor at the Gabonese embassy in Israel. The following year, he was appointed ambassador of Gabon to Equatorial Guinea.\nIn October 1975, he returned to national education as director of the Teacher Training Center in Oyem after serving as head of the school district of Woleu-Ntem and being appointed inspector of national education.\nDeath\nNdouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud was assassinated on July 19, 1977, near his home in the Ak\u00e9b\u00e9 neighborhood in Libreville. According to Pierre P\u00e9an, Ndouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud had reportedly married Josephine Kama Dabany, also known as Patience Dabany, in a customary union, who later became the wife of Omar Bongo, President of Gabon. For the French journalist, the death of the Gabonese poet was linked to this past relationship with Omar Bongo's wife. Although the assassination of Ndouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud remains unresolved, he is said to have been \"cold-bloodedly murdered\" by three members of the presidential guard. Placide Ondo also mentioned rumors of a crime of passion involving Ndouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud and Josephine Kama. Jeune Afrique magazine indicates that Ndouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud was an opponent of Omar Bongo's regime.\nAt the time of his death, Ndouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud left behind a widow and six children, including his daughter Flore Andr\u00e9a Ndouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud, who continues to honor her father's memory by organizing events and cultural workshops to promote the poet's work.\nWorks\nNdouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud published two collections of poetry:\nPassages. Poetic Essays, Libreville, National Pedagogical Institute, 1969.\nR\u00eaves \u00e0 l'aube (Dreams at Dawn), Libreville, National Pedagogical Institute, 1975.\nHe also published a four-act play, La Plaie (The Wound).\nAt the time of his death, he left several projects awaiting publication: a novel titled Le Gouverneur des lacs (The Governor of the Lakes); a play titled Elle ne l'\u00e9pousera pas (She Won't Marry Him); and a collection of tales and proverbs titled Les miettes du pass\u00e9 (The Crumbs of the Past).\nNdouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud expressed his love for writing and especially for poetry in these words: \"I cannot say how or why I came to poetry. An essentially literary education, a particular taste for the marvelous, and a very sensitive nature must have led me to poetry... Why poetry? Simply because I have a fundamentally Negro soul, and poetry is the literary form that suits the expression of the Negro soul, imbued with sensitivity\".\nIn his anthology of Gabonese poets, Eric Jo\u00ebl Bekale notes that Ndouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud was \"the best-known Gabonese writer of the seventies\".\nNdouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud's work is well-represented in anthologies of Gabonese literature. Literary critic Fortunat Obiang notes that \"Ndouna D\u00e9p\u00e9naud favors themes that sufficiently indicate that his writing is on the margins of the lyrical protest inherent in Negritude\".\n",
    "\nThe Naf War was a major military engagement between the Bangladesh Rifles (now Border Guard Bangladesh ) and the Burmese military.  The battle lasted three days.  The 2,500 soldiers of the Bangladesh Rifles fought against two divisions of the Burmese Army and Burmese Navy, i.e. 25,000 soldiers.\nBackground\nIn 1966, an agreement was reached between the governments of Pakistan and Burma during the border settlement. According to the agreement, the middle part of the Naf River sector was specified as the border between the two countries. The Naf River has twelve tributaries in Myanmar. As per the agreement, the middle part of the Naf River sector was recognized as the international boundary, so Myanmar could not take any action, which could cause major disruption in the course of the Naf River. But Myanmar ignored the agreement and built dams on eleven out of twelve rivers by 2000. Due to this, the main flow of Naf River was diverted towards Bangladesh and about 2500 acres of land was lost from the territory of Bangladesh.\nIn 2000, when Myanmar attempted to build a dam at the last tributary, there were several rounds of meetings between the border guards of the two countries. When this dam was being built, it was feared that the Bangladeshi part of the Naf River would flood causing Teknaf city to disappear, so when the Bangladesh Rifles requested not to build the dam in accordance with the 1966 agreement, but the Myanmar border guards sent a letter in threatening tone. \"From NASAKA HQ to BDR HQ Bangladesh. We are warning you to behave otherwise we will teach you lessons you will never forget.\"\nUltimately  the Bangladesh Rifles decided to stop the dam by military force.\nBattle\nIn terms of military position, the military position of Bangladesh was slightly below the position of Myanmar. However, the Bangladesh Rifles identified ammunition sufficiency as the deciding factor in a potential battle.\nAccording to the then Director General of BDR, Major General Alam Fazlur Rahman, he sent different types of ammunition from mortar shells to Cox's Bazar the night before the war started. He ordered half of this to be deployed at Cox's Bazar, while the rest of the ammunition was sent to the main battlefield.\nThe main battle started on January 8, 2000, at 2:30 PM. General Fazlur Rahman was staying in Dinajpur that day as part of a regular border inspection. From there he ordered the start of the operation through a codename \"Bismillah\" .\nThe battle was organized in the area adjacent to Parrot Island in the Huaikung Union of Teknaf. Here the BDR opened fire in front of a bend in the Naf river. About six hundred Myanmar soldiers and dam construction workers were killed in the ambush. Burmese army gathering and casualties in the war received from intelligence sources. Shortly before the battle several spies were sent to Burma to collect information. Information from them shows that 25,000 soldiers of the Burmese regular forces, under a major general and a rear admiral, appeared on the battlefield. Compared to that, the military preparedness of Bangladesh was very inadequate (only 2,500 regular soldiers). The then ruling military junta, a council called the State Peace and Development Council, was in charge of the Myanmar government. The chairman of this council, Senior General Than Shwe, was the head of government of Myanmar, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.\nGeneral Than Shwe summoned foreign journalists and ambassadors stationed in Rangoon on January 9 and announced that \"We want Bangladesh and us to discuss and settle the disputed issues together without any preconditions.\"\nHe also sent a letter from Myanmar asking Bangladesh to stop the attack.\nCeasefire\nBy January 10, the war had ended due to a unilateral withdrawal from the war. A high-level delegation was sent to Maungdaw, accepting Burma's offer of unconditional talks. The delegation led by the then Joint Secretary (Political) of the Ministry of Home Affairs Zanib ul Haq presented Bangladesh's proposals. A handwritten pledge was signed at the meeting, in which the Myanmar government promised to refrain from any future attempt to build any form of dam on the Naf River.\nAftermath\nAlthough the Naf War was short-term conflict in terms of its scope and duration, it had a long-term impact. After this war regular conferences were held at the level of the Border Guards. In recognition of victory in the battle, the government of Bangladesh awarded a gallantry medal called Operation Naf Padak to every soldier who participated in the battle. For the first time in Bangladesh, BDR won a single victory in a battle without the participation of the army.\nAlso the rarest feat achieved by BDR in Naf war was zero mortality. In the fierce battle that lasted for three days, more than six hundred people were killed on the Burmese side, but not a single person was killed in the BDR. Only a few were wounded.\n",

In order to present the best effect of Olympic athletes, the actors engaged in high-intensity training for short track speed skating and in order to play the role of a short track speed skater, Meng Meiqi started training four months in advance and in order to be closer in terms of physique of a short track speed skater, she gained 15\u00a0kg (33\u00a0lb). In order to embody her character's role, Meng put a rock inside one of her ice skates in order to feel the real pain, causing her foot to bleed. The film was shot in Northeast China at temperatures of \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C (14\u00a0\u00b0F). To present the summer training part of the film, the actresses wore short sleeves and completed several hours of intensive filming.\nDuring the filming, when Heilongjiang was in the midst of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee provided assistance in the filming process through location scouting, production safety and epidemic prevention and control, ensuring that the film crew successfully completed filming. On May 9, the filming  was officially completed after 68 days and nights of shooting.\nPre-publicity and release\nOn 26 September 2018, the film crew held a press conference to announce the start of filming. On 31 December 2020, the concept poster of the film was released and it was announced that it would be released on the first day of the Chinese New Year in 2022 (February 1). On 22 February 2022, the final trailer was released revealing that the film would be released on 25 February 2022, five days after the closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

Following its official release in China on 25 February 2022, the film was officially released in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries in September 2023, and in Nigeria in April 2023.\nPrior to its release on February 25, the film was estimated to make \u00a5100 million in box office. However, following its release and till March 2022, the film only made less than \u00a56 million in box office and according to Hong Kong news portal HK01, this made the film a box office flop.\nSoundtrack\nThe film's official theme song My Heart is Flying (Chinese: \u5fc3\u98de\u626c; pinyin: X\u012bn f\u0113i y\u00e1ng) was sung by Meng Meiqi.\nAwards and nominations\n",
    "Welsh Conservatives frontbench team (1999\u20132007)\nNick Bourne, the leader of the Welsh Conservative Group in the National Assembly for Wales, formed his frontbench team of party spokespeople between 18 August and 25 August 1999 after he was elected unopposed to succeed Rod Richards as group leader on 18 August, having already served as acting leader since 11 August. He made a minor reshuffle to his frontbench team in 2000 and made further changes to the team after the 2003 and 2007 National Assembly elections. Bourne's party became the official opposition after the 2007 Welsh government formation in July 2007, with Bourne leading a shadow cabinet as the leader of the opposition.\nBackground\nNick Bourne contested the 1998 Welsh Conservatives leadership election with Rod Richards to become leader of the Welsh Conservative Group in the National Assembly for Wales after its establishment in 1999. At the first assembly election in May 1999, Bourne was elected as the assembly member (AM) for Mid and West Wales. The Conservatives returned nine AMs in total and it became the third-largest party in the assembly behind the official opposition Plaid Cymru and the governing Labour Party.\nOn 11 August 1999, Bourne was elected by the Welsh Conservative Group to serve as its acting leader after Richards' temporary resignation and his appointment of deputy leader David TC Davies as acting leader earlier that month following accusations of assault which he was later cleared of in 2000, a move which was opposed by the other members of the group. Richards resigned in a permanent capacity in response and on 18 August Bourne was elected unopposed as his successor.\nHistory\nOn his election as leader on 18 August 1999, Bourne appointed David TC Davies to his frontbench team as policy director after praising him for his conduct during the leadership election. He formed the rest of his frontbench team on 25 August, keeping Davies as the group's chief whip while abolishing his deputy leadership position and making him the new spokesperson for environment, transport and planning. Davies also lost his role as group business manager to William Graham, who became the new business manager. Peter Rodgers, the previous spokesperson for environment, transport and planning, became the spokesperson for agriculture and rural affairs. His predecessor Glyn Davies became the new spokesperson for finance, which was the portfolio previously held by Bourne before he became leader. Alun Cairns, David Melding and Jonathan Morgan retained their previous positions in the frontbench as spokesperson for economic development and Europe, spokesperson for health and social services and spokesperson for education respectively. Previous leader Rod Richards was not given a post in Bourne's new frontbench team, making him the only Conservative AM to serve as a backbencher.\nA minor reshuffle occurred in 2000, with David TC Davies losing his role as policy director to David Melding, a role which he kept until 2011. In the same year, former leader Rod Richards was suspended from the Welsh Conservative Group for voting against the party whip in a budget vote in 1999. He served as an independent conservative in the assembly for the remainder of his term.\nAt the 2003 National Assembly for Wales election, Bourne's Welsh Conservatives increased its share of the seats in the assembly from 9 to 11. However, it remained the third-largest party behind the official opposition Plaid Cymru which had 12 seats and the governing party Welsh Labour which had 30 seats. Bourne reshuffled his frontbench team alongside the other opposition parties as First Minister Rhodri Morgan formed his new cabinet on 8 May 2003. All but one member of the Welsh Conservative Group were given portfolios, including Alun Cairns who became spokesperson for economic development and transport, David TC Davies who became spokesperson for education and lifelong learning, Glyn Davies who became spokesperson for local government, environment and planning, Lisa Francis who became spokesperson for Welsh language and culture, William Graham who became spokesperson for social justice and chief whip, Mark Isherwood who became spokesperson for finance, Laura Anne Jones who became spokesperson for sport, Jonathan Morgan who became business manager and spokesperson for health and social services, and Brynle Williams who became spokesperson for farming and rural development. David Melding was the only Welsh Conservative AM without a role in the frontbench team, as he decided to move to the backbenches to focus on his campaign for a federal United Kingdom and further devolution to the National Assembly. He rejoined the frontbench in November 2004, when he took over from Jonathan Morgan as business manager, and in 2005 he returned to his post as policy director.\nAt the 2007 National Assembly for Wales election in May 2007, the Welsh Conservatives increased its share of assembly seats from 11 to 12. Bourne made another reshu",

As a performer, she is best known for playing the lead role in various productions of Georges Bizet's Carmen. She has been a member of the National Assembly of Serbia since February 2024, serving with the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).\nOpera singer\nVrane\u0161 is originally from Vr\u0161ac in the province of Vojvodina. In her youth, she often travelled to Belgrade on weekends to watch operas, ballets, and plays. She holds a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from the Faculty of Music at the University of Arts in Belgrade, where she studied under Radmila Bako\u010devi\u0107.

She became a member of the ensemble of the National Theatre in Belgrade in 2011 and has also performed regularly with the Romanian National Opera, Bucharest. An Austrian reviewer has described her as \"perfectly cast\" for the role of Carmen.\nIn 2022, she performed Carmen at the Oper Burg Gars in Austria, in a production that had been postponed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She received excellent reviews, with one writer praising her as an \"attractive, sensual, and yet not exaggerated Carmen, who found convincing role interpretation in her differentiated expression.\"\nVrane\u0161's many performances of Carmen include a rock version in Craiova, Romania. Her other roles include Santuzza in Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, Eboli in Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlos, and Delilah in Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns's Samson and Delilah. In 2019, she was part of an international cast of star performers at the Minsk International Christmas Opera Forum in Belarus.\nPolitician\nVrane\u0161 was given the sixth position on the Serbian Progressive Party's Serbia Must Not Stop electoral list in the 2023 Serbian parliamentary election. This was tantamount to election, and she was indeed elected when the list won a majority victory with 129 out of 250 seats. She has said, \"I am a patriot and I will always do the best for my country. That's why I wholeheartedly support Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107's policy and everything he does.\" It was rumoured after the election that she would be appointed as Serbia's minister of culture, although ultimately this did not happen.\nShe is now a member of the culture and information committee and a deputy member of European integration committee and the committee on the diaspora and Serbs in the region. One of her colleagues in the SNS parliamentary caucus is operatic mezzo-soprano Jadranka Jovanovi\u0107, whom she has described as a role model in her singing career.\n",
    "2024 novel by Brandon Sanderson\nWind and Truth is an epic fantasy novel written by American author Brandon Sanderson and the fifth book in The Stormlight Archive series.

Sanderson has said that the latter half of the series will be written after he finishes writing the upcoming Era Three Mistborn trilogy and the two Elantris sequels.\nAs with Kaladin in The Way of Kings, Shallan in Words of Radiance, Dalinar in Oathbringer and the characters Eshonai and Venli in Rhythm of War, Wind and Truth will have a sequence of flashback chapters, this time from the perspective of Szeth, the Assassin in White.\nThe unabridged audiobook will be read by narration team Michael Kramer and Kate Reading.\nDevelopment\nThe writing process for the book started in January 2022.

    "Italian composer\nCarlo Alessandro Landini\nCarlo Alessandro Landini (born April 20, 1954, in Milan, Italy) is an Italian composer, scholar and essayist.\nBiography\nCarlo Alessandro Landini began his musical studies in the piano and composition classes of the Milan Conservatorio \"Giuseppe Verdi\", under the guidance of Piero Rattalino and Bruno Bettinelli respectively, graduating in 1978 and 1979. However, his interests did not limit themselves to the sole field of music but led him to graduate in 1982 in Modern Literature, with a dissertation dedicated to the Capuchin nun Saint Veronica Giuliani, a text later on revised and published in the form of a more extensive essay.\nAfter graduating in composition, Landini followed, between 1975 and 1978, the specialization courses held by Franco Donatoni at the Accademia Chigiana (Siena) and again, between 1978 and 1986, the summer courses in Darmstadt held by the masters of French \"spectral music\" (G\u00e9rard Grisey, Tristan Murail, Hugues Dufourt). He then attended courses with Iannis Xenakis, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti (Aix-en-Provence) and Witold Lutoslawski (Gro\u017enjan). In 1979 he moved to Paris, where he received lessons from Olivier Messiaen and, once admitted to the prestigious CNSM, attended the classes of Ivo Malec and Claude Ballif. He was awarded the Premier Prix by a unanimous jury. In 1981 he moved to the United States on a Fulbright Fellowship. He resided in San Diego for two years, where he studied and taught at the University of California, eventually graduating in 1983.\nFrom 1983 he taught in the Conservatory of Piacenza with the role of Professor with tenure, eventually retiring in 2021. Appointed at Columbia University (New York) in 2003, he works with Jonathan Kramer, attending Fred Lerdahl\u2019s lessons, thus investigating the modelling of tension and relaxation in pitch-space. A Fellow of the Italian Academy (Columbia, New York), he served as Visiting Professor at the University of Maryland in Baltimore (2006), the Musikhochschule in Trossingen (2010), the Hamu in Prague (2012).\nHis works have been performed in important contemporary music festivals, including the historic Ferienkurse in Darmstadt, Chigiana in Siena, the Venice Biennale, the World New Music Days in Vienna-Bratislava, the Prokofiev Festival in St. Petersburg, Salle Gaveau in Paris, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Pomeriggi Musicali in Milan, the Roy O. Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the Livewire Festival in Baltimore, JD Robb Composers\u2019 Symposium in Albuquerque, the Autunno Musicale Campano in Caserta, the Filharmonia \u015al\u0105ska Season in Katowice and many others. His works are published by Pizzicato, Sonzogno, Alphonse Leduc, Curci, Carisch.\nLandini is the winner of important international awards for his compositions, such as the Valentino Bucchi (Rome, 1986), Ernest Bloch (Lugano, 1994), K. Serocki (Warsaw, 2002 and again 2004), Athens (2010), the prestigious W. Lutos\u0142awski (Warsaw, 2007), being the first and only Italian ever to have won this contest. He also emerged as the winner in the \"Francesco Siciliani\" Competition (Perugia, 2016) with his Kyrie for choir of 9 mixed voices.\nMusic\nHis Sonata No. 1 for piano (1981) lasts over an hour his Piano Sonata No. 2 (1987) an hour and a half, his string quartet Changes is a single, long and uninterrupted movement of 40 minutes (its first performance, entrusted to the prestigious Arditti quartet, took place on August 5, 1994, in Darmstadt) the Sonata No. 5 lasts \"seven hours without even a break\" whereas its short version lasts 2 hours and a half. The \"mammoth\" score of this huge work (dedicated to the Genoese pianist Massimiliano Damerini) consists of 650 pages and has been defined a \"massage of the body and mind\" pretending to give the listener \"hours of reflection, rest, well-being\".\nThe musicologist Quirino Principe sees in his music \"a search for beautiful sound\" that is, the sound vehicle of beauty, which is not present in other composers\". In his music the durations are always, continues Principe, \"in an organic and necessary relationship with the gradualness that carves the beauty of sound\". The cultural sphere in which his music moves is, as the musicologist Renzo Cresti states, \"closely linked to the Middle-European one, expanded to the ancient Greek-Latin civilization\", such as to situate Landini \"a thousand miles away from a volatile communication that doesn't convey anything meaningful: the composer ends up being obsessed with a subtle chisel work that digs and deepens, like a spiral that plunges into the meanders of being\".\n",

    "Species of flowering plants\nOurisia macrocarpa or snowy mountain foxglove is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. Joseph Dalton Hooker described O. macrocarpa in 1853. Plants of this species of New Zealand foxglove are showy, perennial, large-leaved, tufted, rhizomatous herbs that are mostly glabrous (hairless) or with some non-glandular hairs. They have broadly ovate leaves. The flowers are in whorls in each node, with an irregular calyx, a large, white irregular corolla, and fruits up to 1\u00a0cm long. The corolla tube is yellow with three lines of yellow hairs inside. It is listed as Not Threatened.\nTaxonomy\nOurisia macrocarpa Hook.f. is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. Joseph Dalton Hooker described O. macrocarpa in 1853. It is also known as snowy mountain foxglove.\nThe type material was collected by David Lyall from Dusky Bay, South Island, New Zealand. The holotype is housed at the herbarium at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew (K000979333).\nOurisia macrocarpa plants are large and showy perennials with whorls of flowers with large white corollas and large fruits (up to 1\u00a0cm long), characters they share with other New Zealand species O. calycina and O. macrophylla. Like O. macrocarpa, South American species O. coccinea and O. ruellioides are also large and showy with large fruits, but their flowers are in pairs instead of whorls in each node, and have red corollas.\nOurisia macrocarpa is morphologically most similar to another large-leaved New Zealand species, O. calycina. The two species were once treated as varieties of O. macrocarpa by both Leonard Cockayne and Lucy Moore, and Mary Kalin Arroyo treated them as subspecies. Although Heidi Meudt followed Arroyo's taxonomy in her monograph, a later phylogenetic study that showed that O. macrocarpa and O. calycina were not each other's closest relatives, which lead the authors to conclude that species rank would be more suitable.\nA number of morphological differences also distinguish O. macrocarpa from O. calycina, including its  broadly to very broadly ovate leaves (vs. narrowly to broadly ovate), rounded to cordate leaf bases (vs cuneate to truncate), petiole fringed with hairs on the lower portion only (vs fringed for its entire length), smooth calyx lobe edges (vs irregularly notched), irregular calyx (vs regular calyx), and glabrous peduncle (vs hairy). In addition, the two species are allopatric with O. macrocarpa found in southern South Island only, and O. calycina in northern and central South Island.\nOurisia macrocarpa can be distinguished from another large-leaved species, O. macrophylla, by its irregular calyx (vs. regular), and a lack of glandular hairs anywhere on the mostly hairless plants (vs. glandular hairs present at least on the pedicel and generally hairy plants).\nDescription\nOurisia macrocarpa plants are large perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, with opposite leaves that are tightly tufted along the horizontal stem. Leaf petioles are 34.5\u2013150.0\u00a0mm long. Leaf blades are 12.3\u2013135.1\u00a0mm long by 7.4\u201371.4\u00a0mm wide (length: width ratio 1.0\u20131.7: 1), broadly to very broadly ovate, widest below the middle, with an acute apex; rounded or cordate base; and regularly crenate edges. Leaves are mostly glabrous (hairless), with a fringe of non-glandular hairs on the lower edges only, and densely punctate on the lower surface, sometimes also with non-glandular hairs on the midvein. Inflorescences are erect, with usually glabrous racemes up to 61\u00a0cm long, and with 1\u20138 flowering nodes and up to 32 or more total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node has up to 9 flowers and 3\u20139 sessile and clasping bracts that are usually lanceolate to narrowly ovate or oblanceolate to obovate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves, 12.2\u201324/- mm long and 3.9\u201310.2\u00a0mm wide, and become smaller toward the apex of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a glabrous or hairy pedicel that is up to 64.7\u00a0mm long and has non-glandular hairs only. The calyx is 7.5\u201312.2\u00a0mm long, irregular, with two lobes divided to the base and three lobes divided to one-half to two-thirds the calyx length, with a few non-glandular hairs to densely distributed hairs on the smooth edges and base. The corolla is 16.4\u201331.3\u00a0mm long (including the 5.7\u201316.1\u00a0mm long corolla tube), bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous and white (sometimes flushed pink) on the outside, and yellow and with three lines of yellow hairs on the inside. The corolla lobes are 5.9\u201315.3\u00a0mm long, spreading, and obovate or obcordate. There are 4 stamens up to 15.9\u00a0mm long which are didynamous, with two long stamens that are exserted, and 2 short stamens reaching the corolla tube opening; a short staminode 0.5\u20134.1\u00a0mm long is also present. The style is 5.5\u201310.7\u00a0mm long, exserted or reaching the corolla tube opening, with an emarginate stigma. The ovary is 3.0\u20134.6\u00a0mm long and glabrous. Fruits are capsules 5.0\u20139.9\u00a0mm long and 4.0\u20138.0\u00a0mm wide with loculicidal d",
    "1974 studio album by Baikida E.J. Carroll\nOrange Fish Tears is the debut album by trumpeter and composer Baikida Carroll, on which he is joined by saxophonist Oliver Lake, pianist Manuel Villardel, and percussionist Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos. It was recorded during June 3\u20135, 1974, at Studio Palm in Paris, during a visit to France by members of the Black Artists Group. The album was initially released on vinyl in 1974 by Palm Records, and was reissued in 2023 in remastered form on vinyl, CD, and as a digital download, by the French label SouffleContinu Records.\nReception\nJJ Skolnik of Bandcamp Daily called the recording \"a rich and joyous album that more than deserves its place in the free jazz canon,\" and wrote: \"Orange Fish Tears is perhaps free jazz at its most approachable, but that in no way means that it's any less fiery than the more avant-garde side of things.\"\nThe New York City Jazz Record's Duck Baker stated: \"As one of the most significant improvising trumpet voices of the past 50 years, it's shocking to realize that Baikida Carroll has only averaged barely one record per decade as a leader... This was a most impressive debut, and it stands the test of time extremely well as a unique gem that amply rewards repeated listening.\"\nEd Hazell of Point of Departure commented: \"the album certainly ranks among the most assured leader debuts in jazz... Carroll emphasizes a collective group approach, careful integration of composition and improvisation, and a fine balance between musical elements... The reissue lets us consider its place among the most innovative and important albums of its day.\"\nWriting for JazzWord, Ken Waxman noted that the album \"heralds further explorations,\" and remarked: \"Creation of sound collages as well as whinnying and staccato pivots into pure improvisation and rhythmic asides is what makes Orange Fish Tears a BAG-classic and progenitor of musical currents that would be more fully investigated in the following decades.\"\nTrack listing\n\"Orange Fish Tears\" (Baikida Carroll) \u2013 8:00\n\"Forest Scorpion\" (Baikida Carroll) \u2013 12:06\n\"Rue Roger\" (Oliver Lake) \u2013 9:41\n\"Porte D'Orl\u00e9ans\" (Baikida Carroll) \u2013 14:15\nPersonnel\nBaikida Carroll \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn, cowbell, horns, percussion\nOliver Lake \u2013 soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, flute, bamboo flute, percussion\nManuel Villardel \u2013 piano, electric piano, percussion\nNan\u00e1 Vasconcelos \u2013 cuica, tabla, timbales, bells, percussion\n",
    "2nd race of the 2023 ARCA Menards Series East\nMotor car race\nThe 2023 General Tire 125 was the second stock car race of the 2023 ARCA Menards Series East season, and the 9th running of the event. The race was originally scheduled to be held on Friday, April 28, 2023, but was postponed until Saturday, April 29, due to constant rain showers. The race was held at Dover Motor Speedway in Dover, Delaware, a 1-mile (1.6\u00a0km) permanent asphalt oval shaped speedway. It was originally scheduled to be contested over 125 laps, but was increased to 127 laps, due to a NASCAR overtime finish. In a wild finish, Jake Finch, driving for Venturini Motorsports, would hold off Landen Lewis in a side-by-side battle on the final restart to earn his first career ARCA Menards Series East win. Finch would also dominate the race, leading a race-high 89 laps. To fill out the podium, Luke Fenhaus, driving for Pinnacle Racing Group, would finish in 3rd, respectively.\nReport\nBackground\nDover Motor Speedway, the circuit where the race will be held.\nDover Motor Speedway is an oval race track in Dover, Delaware, United States that has held at least two NASCAR races since it opened in 1969. In addition to NASCAR, the track also hosted USAC and the NTT IndyCar Series. The track features one layout, a 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) concrete oval, with 24\u00b0 banking in the turns and 9\u00b0 banking on the straights. The speedway is owned and operated by Speedway Motorsports.\nThe track, nicknamed \"The Monster Mile\", was built in 1969 by Melvin Joseph of Melvin L. Joseph Construction Company, Inc., with an asphalt surface, but was replaced with concrete in 1995. Six years later in 2001, the track's capacity moved to 135,000 seats, making the track have the largest capacity of sports venue in the mid-Atlantic. In 2002, the name changed to Dover International Speedway from Dover Downs International Speedway after Dover Downs Gaming and Entertainment split, making Dover Motorsports. From 2007 to 2009, the speedway worked on an improvement project called \"The Monster Makeover\", which expanded facilities at the track and beautified the track. After the 2014 season, the track's capacity was reduced to 95,500 seats.\nEntry list\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\nStarting lineup\nPractice and qualifying were both scheduled to be held on Friday, April 26, but were both cancelled due to constant rain showers. The starting lineup would be determined by the ARCA rulebook. As a result, William Sawalich, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, would start on the pole.\nStarting lineup\nRace results\nStandings after the race\n",
    "1919 coup d'\u00e9tat in Peru\nThe 1919 Peruvian coup d'\u00e9tat took place on July 4, 1919, headed by former president and president-elect Augusto B. Legu\u00eda, with the support of the gendarmerie forces of Lima, against the outgoing government of Jos\u00e9 Pardo y Barreda. The result of the coup was successful for Legu\u00eda, who began the political process known as the New Motherland, through which he sought to modernise the country through a change in relations between the state and civil society, and which led to an eleven-year dictatorship. This new government ended abruptly due to another coup d'\u00e9tat in 1930, led by Commander Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro.\nBackground\nIn the 1919 elections, called by then-president Jos\u00e9 Pardo y Barreda, \u00c1ntero Asp\u00edllaga\u00a0 (president of the ruling Civilista Party) and former president Augusto B. Legu\u00eda (candidate of the opposition Reformist Democratic Party) who had governed the country between 1908 and 1912. During the presidential campaign, Legu\u00eda presented himself as the standard bearer of the desires of university youth and the working and popular classes to change the structures of the country. His victory was in sight, as he was the most charismatic candidate.\nThe elections were held and the scrutiny showed Legu\u00eda as the winner; It was then that the Supreme Court annulled a large number of votes that favored the Democratic Reformist Party (the Supreme Court annulled some 15,000 votes in favour of Legu\u00eda) and it was feared that the elections would be annulled by Congress. Faced with this panorama, and alleging that his victory was not going to be recognised by the government, Legu\u00eda and his supporters staged a coup d'\u00e9tat in the early hours of July 4, 1919.\nCoup\nThe plan consisted of two battalions of the gendarmerie of Lima attacking the Government Palace. The plot, started on July 3, was a success since the Army did not repel the coup, the sailors of Callao Naval Base were inclined to put an end to the civilian government, and the conspirators managed to arrest President Jos\u00e9 Pardo, who was to complete his mandate in just 45 days, and part of his government. Legu\u00eda made his brand new entry into the Presidential Palace at six in the morning, being applauded by the related troops and civilian supporters.\nThe commander in chief of the national Army greets the chiefs and officers of the different bodies of the garrison and the navy, and informs them that by virtue of the movement carried out this morning, President Jos\u00e9 Pardo has been deposed, and proclaimed the one chosen by the people, A. B. Legu\u00eda. \u2014\u200aProclamation of Colonel Gerardo \u00c1lvarez\nThere was an attempt to restore constitutional order by Colonel Samuel del Alc\u00e1zar, who commanded an Army battalion that was deployed through the streets surrounding the main square. As the companies arrived at the palace, they joined the coup. After a brief skirmish between the gendarmes guarding the Presidential Palace and the troops accompanying Colonel Alc\u00e1zar, he was arrested. For his part, the chief of the General Staff, Colonel Pedro Pablo Mart\u00ednez, tried to gather the troops quartered in the Santa Beatriz barracks to assault the palace, but the soldiers had joined the coup, cheering on Legu\u00eda.\nA mob attacked the facilities of the El Comercio newspaper, while another set fire to President Pardo's residence.\nPardo was exiled to New York City. Legu\u00eda assumed power as provisional president and his first act was to dissolve Congress, which was adverse to him. On July 21, Legu\u00eda published a manifesto in the official newspaper El Peruano, justifying his actions:\nThe consideration that it is an unavoidable duty to ensure that the popular vote already cast is not frustrated forces me to assume the Supreme Headquarters of the Republic as Provisional President. \u2014\u200aAugusto B. Legu\u00eda, 21 July 1919\nThe coup d'\u00e9tat was supported only by the Constitutional Party of Andr\u00e9s Avelino C\u00e1ceres.\nAftermath\nLegu\u00eda called a plebiscite to submit to the vote of the citizens a series of constitutional reforms that he considered necessary; Among these reforms, it was contemplated to elect at the same time the President of the Republic and the members of Congress, both with five-year terms (previously, the presidential term was four years and Parliament was renewed by thirds every two years). In this way, he wanted to strengthen the Executive against the Legislative and avoid the exacerbated parliamentary opposition that he had suffered in his first government. He also called for elections to be held in September to form a new constituent congress, which would take the name of the National Assembly, whose mission would be to give a new Political Constitution, replacing that of 1860, which was the one in force at that time. The Assembly was installed on September 24, 1919, and was chaired by the sociologist and jurist Mariano H. Cornejo\u00a0. On October 12, the Assembly proclaimed Legu\u00eda as Constitutional President of the Republic.\nTo reward the Army for its complicity in the coup, ",
    "Peruvian APRA militant; assassin of Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro\nAbelardo Mendoza Leyva (Cerro de Pasco; April 11, 1914 \u2014 Lima; April 30, 1933) was a Peruvian militant of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) who assassinated President Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro while he was reviewing troops at the Santa Beatriz racetrack and was at the same time killed by his presidential escort.\nBiography\nBorn in Cerro de Pasco, he arrived in Lima at a very young age. He got a job as a domestic in a warehouse located on the second block of Malambo Street (current Francisco Pizarro Avenue, in R\u00edmac). He stayed there for three years, until, wanting to earn more money, and with the recommendation of his former boss, he started working as an employee at the La Pi\u00f1ita bar, located on a corner of Nicol\u00e1s de Pi\u00e9rola Avenue. At La Pi\u00f1ita he worked for four years, until 1930, when he was fired after being caught stealing. This is because his meager salary was not enough to support his partner. Becoming unemployed, he lent himself money for a while, giving the bar as collateral; On one occasion, one of his creditors took him to the police station.\nAccording to Luis Alberto S\u00e1nchez, around 1931 he was a street chocolate seller in Chosica. At that time he enrolled in the Aprista Party, attending the local branch in said town.\nThen he rotated through various temporary jobs in Callao, La Punta and Miraflores, until he found a better job as a cook in an inn in Surquillo. One of the owners of that business was Alejandro Cortijo, an APRA who held party meetings at his premises, which Mendoza also attended. Intervened by the police, Mendoza was imprisoned on March 13, 1933, in the El Sexto Prison. He was released on April 4.\nOnce again unemployed, Mendoza was supported by his friends, who gave him housing, until he finally found refuge in the premises of the Graphic Federation, thanks to the protection of Pedro Catalino L\u00e9vano, who was the janitor of said premises. Mendoza spent the night there the night before the murder of S\u00e1nchez Cerro. It is also mentioned that he received advice from Leopoldo Pita, a lower-ranking APRA leader.\nAssassination of S\u00e1nchez Cerro\nMain article: Assassination of Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro\nOn the morning of April 30, 1933, President Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro reviewed the troops who were going to fight in the armed conflict with Colombia and who were gathered at the Santa Beatriz Hippodrome, today the Campo de Marte. After the ceremony, he retired in his open vehicle with an escort. Accompanying him inside the vehicle were Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Manzanilla\u00a0, Chief of Military Staff Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Ram\u00edrez and his aide-de-camp, Major Eleazar Atencio. S\u00e1nchez Cerro sat in the back seat of the car, on the right side, while Manzanilla was to his left. Rodr\u00edguez and Atencio were in the front seats, in addition to the pilot. Next to it was a horse escort and followed by another car, where the members of the Military Staff were riding. The vehicle moved slowly, in the middle of the crowd, at the request of the president himself, who wanted to avoid any accidents.\nIt was in that circumstance when Abelardo Mendoza Leyva, armed with a Browning brand automatic pistol, crossed the line of gendarmes, rushed towards the presidential car, and holding onto the hood, fired several shots at the president in the back. The driver accelerated the car, throwing Mendoza to the ground, who was instantly shot by the members of the presidential escort who were closely following the car and by the members of the Military House who were in another car, a few metres away. behind the one carrying the president. Even some soldiers from the escort pierced him with their spears. The autopsy protocol determined that Mendoza's body had 20 gunshot wounds caused by thirteen projectiles, and 4 spear wounds that destroyed a lung, liver and intestines. The weapon used by Mendoza was picked up by an individual named \u00c1ngel Mill\u00e1n Ramos, who took it with him, although a witness identified him, and he was captured and involved in the crime.\nSee also\nLuis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro\n",

    "Stories that are part of the culture of the Galician people\nRemains of the mythical Castle of Saint George, on Mount Pindo, the \"Celtic Mount Olympus\"\nGalician mythology is the set of myths and stories that are part of the culture of the Galician people. They are a series of narrative stories or cultural expressions of sacred origin and later secularized and treated stories of the culture. Sometimes they relate to a specific era or to a series of beliefs of an imaginary nature.\nBackground\nDating to pre-Roman times, these stories, once of a religious or spiritual nature, are based on traditions and legends created to explain the universe, the origin of the world, natural phenomena, and anything else for which there was no simple explanation. Not all stories have an explanatory purpose.

Teaming up with Sir Silke, Marius, and the Witch (resembling Jessica), the two face off against the realm's evil king (resembling Jerry, who seeks to invade reality) as they quest to return home.\nPremise\nPart One\nMorty finds himself struggling with his school reading, a bleak folklore tome proving too daunting to conquer. Despite Jessica finally showing interest in connecting with him over the book, Morty's progress is slow. Fortunately, Rick has just completed his latest invention: a device promising to imbue the reader with all of a book's knowledge in mere seconds. But as with many of Rick's creations, things quickly spiral out of control. Instead of a quick fix, Morty and Rick find themselves inexplicably transported into the very pages of the book. Rick awakens in the guise of a sorcerer, surrounded by arcane tools and ancient tomes. Meanwhile, Morty finds himself transformed into a humble squire, trapped within the confines of a towering castle. Together, they're thrust into an adventure unlike any they've faced before in the vast expanse of the multiverse.\nPart Two\nTrapped within the enchanted confines of a fairy tale book, Wizard Rick finds himself commissioned by the king ((resembling Jerry) to vanquish an ominous witch (resembling Jessica) who's been snaring the kingdom's children. Initially hesitant to pursue this matter, Rick's resolve solidifies when he learns that the witch has ensnared Morty, his own grandson. Thus, with a reluctant but loyal dim-witted knight by his side, Rick embarks on a perilous journey into the foreboding depths of the forest. Meanwhile, Morty's path intersects with another valiant knight before Rick's arrival. This knight, a captivating woman, ensures Morty's safety, though the duo faces the daunting task of traversing the treacherous forest to return to the safety of the castle. However, Rick soon discovers that the truth about the missing children may not align with the king's decree. As they investigate deeper into the mysteries of the magical realm, Morty and Rick find themselves grappling with forces beyond their comprehension.\nPart Three\nAs Rick ventures through the ominous Dank Forest alongside the realm's champion, he faces a daunting challenge: confronting a clone of himself. This task proves to be one of his toughest yet, testing his skills and cunning in unexpected ways. Meanwhile, Morty grapples with his own daunting mission: learning the art of conversing with women. This becomes particularly complicated as he finds himself in the company of Ser Silke, the female knight. Fortunately, fate brings the two groups together just as the malevolent witch makes her appearance. However, her true intentions quickly come to light, revealing that she is not the true adversary. With time running short, the fate of the realms hangs in the balance, urging Rick, Morty, and their companions to act swiftly.\nPart Four\nTrapped in a fantasty realm, Rick and Morty seek a means of escape, their only hope lying in the defeat of the malevolent king bent on world destruction. Differing in their approaches, Morty opts for subtlety while Rick charges ahead with full force. Yet, both strategies falter, thwarting their individual efforts. With time running out, they realize that their only chance lies in collaboration. United, Rick and Morty must pool their strengths if they ever hope to break free from the clutches of the fantasy world and return to reality.\nReception\nThe series has received a generally positive critical reception.\nPart One\nComicBook's Charlie Ridgely says that \"Rick and Morty\" is special because it has a unique tone that's hard to copy. He thinks some licensed stuff based on the show tries to copy it but doesn't do it well. \"Ever After #1\" is like that sometimes\u2014it feels like \"Rick and Morty\" but other times not really. However, the story is interesting enough to make people want to keep reading.\nPart Two\nComicBook's Charlie Ridgely thinks that \"Rick and Morty\" fans will enjoy this story because it feels like a real episode of the show. In the second issue, Rick's character feels authentic, but Morty still seems a bit off, probably because his creator's voice gives him his unique personality. Overall, the story is improving, and Ridgely is now looking forward to the next issue more than ",

    "2023 video game\nSynapse is a 2023 first-person shooter video game developed and published by nDreams. The game was released for the PlayStation VR2 virtual reality headset in July 2023 and received generally positive reviews upon release.\nGameplay\nIn Synapse, which is played from first-person, the player assumes the role of a special agent who must infiltrate the mind of a rogue colonel and extract intel to stop a plan that will result in mass destruction. Gameplay focuses on dual-wielding combat, with the player wielding a gun in one hand while performing telekinetic abiltiies with the other. The game utilizes the eye-tracking functionality of the PlayStation VR2 headset, allowing players to select interactable objects through simply looking at it.\nThe game adopts a structure commonly found in roguelike games. Each successful run will grant players \"Revelations\", which are permanent upgrades for combat. The game features three distinct skill trees, focusing on the player character's weapons, telekinetic abilities, and general resilience. As players progress in the game, they will unlock new weapons such as a pistol, a shotgun, an submachine gun, and a grenade launcher, as well as new abilities such as directly lifting and throwing enemies, as well as capturing grenades mid-air.\nDevelopment\nSynapse was developed by UK developer nDreams. It was considered to be an important project for the studio, which described it as \"the culmination of a decade of VR-only development\". The game was initially envisioned as a spiritual successor to Fracked, the studio's previous game. Paul Weir, who previously worked on No Man's Sky, served as the game's composer. He was inspired by the works of Hans Zimmer, especially his score for Christopher Nolan's \"cerebral blockbuster movies\". Jennifer Hale and David Hayter were cast as Colonel Peter Conrad and Handler Clara Sorensen respectively. Hayter described his character as \"legitimately insane\", while Hale described hers as \"goal-oriented\".\nSynapse was announced at a State of Play livestream event in February 2023, and was released for PlayStation VR2 on July 4 the same year.\nReception\nSynapse received generally positive reviews upon release, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game was awarded \"Best AR/VR Game\" at TIGA Awards 2023.\nIan Higton from Eurogamer described the game as \"a pure power fantasy that epitomises everything great about virtual reality\" and a \"must-buy game that deserves to be played by anyone who owns a PSVR2\". He praised the gameplay for enabling players to feel \"unstoppable\", and noted that the game was more replayable than most other VR shooters. Graham Banas from Push Square liked the frentic gameplay, though he felt that the monochromatic visuals failed to create distinctive in-game environments, and noted that Synapse did not have content. Gamereactor's Petter Hegevall also remarked that the monochromatic visuals made the overall gameplay experience repetitive. While he noted that the game was mechanically effective, the game ultimately felt like a \"glorified tech demo\".\n",
    "Major events and trends in Latin music in the 2010s\nFor Latin music from a year in the 2010s, go to 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19\nRomeo Santos was named Top Latin Artist of the 2010s by Billboard.\nThis article includes an overview of the major events and trends in Latin music in the 2010s, namely in Ibero-America (including Spain and Portugal). This includes the rise and fall of various subgenres in Latin music from 2010 to 2019.\nOverview\n\"Bailando\" by Enrique Iglesias (left) and \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi (right) and Daddy Yankee brought a resurgence of Latin music's popularity to the mainstream audience.\nAt the beginning of the decade, sales of Latin music continued to plummeted, although digital sales began rising. This led to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to lower the threshold for their Latin certifications even further in December 2013. By the mid-2010s however, Latin music began generating revenue thanks to rise of music streaming services. By the late 2010s, Latin music had became mainstream again as it had done in the late 1990s thanks to songs such as \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee and \"Mi Gente\" by J Balvin and Willy William. The trend in Latin music also led Latin artists collaborating or remixing their hits with other mainstream artists such as Justin Bieber, Beyonc\u00e9, Little Mix and Drake.\nLatin pop\nCamila continued the pop rock style music in Spanish during the early 2010s.Latin boyband CNCO became one of the pioneers of the popet\u00f3n movement in the late 2010s.\nIn the early 2010s, the Spanish-language pop rock continued to be popular in the Latin pop field with artists such as Camila, R\u00edo Roma, Jesse & Joy, and Reik being notable artists in the genre. Around the same time, albums of cover versions became popular as well with artists such as Marc Anthony, Cristian Castro, Kalimba, Jenni Rivera, and Sergio Dalma recording hits that are decades old. Colombian superstar Shakira released Sale el Sol in 2010 and sold over four million copies. By the mid-2010s however, pop ballads, which had been popular in the Latin pop field for decades began to slip in popularity. Up-tempo dance, reggaeton, and urbano tracks began taking pop ballad's place due to a change in demographics on radio stations. As a result of said changing demographics, Latin pop began embracing the sounds of reggaeton and has been dubbed \"Popet\u00f3n\" with pop groups such as CNCO and Cali y El Dandee popularizing it.\nRegional Mexican\nCalibre 50 mixed the sounds of norte\u00f1o and banda and would become the artist with the most number-ones on the Billboard Regional Mexican Airplay chart.Christian Nodal became one of the faces of the Mexillenial movements in the late 2010s.\nThe banda genre continued its popularity through the decade and saw the death of Jenni Rivera in 2012. Calibre 50 fused the genres of banda and norte\u00f1o and would later become the act with the most number ones on the Billboard Regional Mexican Airplay chart. 3BallMTY popularized the Tribal guarachero genre with their song \"Int\u00e9ntalo\". By the end of the decade, younger musicians, dubbed \"Mexillenial Artists\" by Billboard began to rise with artists such as Christian Nodal, Luis R. Conriquez, and Luis Coronel.\nTropical\nPrince Royce represented one of the newer generations of bachata music.Gente de Zona became well-known for their tropical fusion.\nFor the first time since its popularity in the 1970s, salsa began to slide as bachata took over as the tropical field's most popular genre. However the salsa field still had veteran artists such Marc Anthony, V\u00edctor Manuelle, Gilberto Santa Rosa, and La India. Anthony scored his biggest Spanish-language hit with \"Vivir Mi Vida\", which revived his career. In the bachata field, Romeo Santos, former lead singer of Aventura, launched his own career and became the most successful Latin artist of the decade. As he had done while with Aventura, he mixed bachata with contemporary genres such as R&B and collaborated with artists such Usher and Drake by having them perform bachata. The decade saw the debut of popular bachata artists such as Prince Royce, Leslie Grace, and Karlos Ros\u00e9. They began their careers by remaking decades old English-language songs such as \"Stand by Me\" and \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow as a bachata tune. Merengue music saw a comeback with the newly style \"merengue mambo\" led by artists such as Omega and Fuego giving it an urban feel. Merengue was further popularized by Venezuelan artists such as Chino & Nacho, El Potro \u00c1lvarez, and Oscarcito. Cumbia remained  popular throughout South America, namely in Argentina and Chile, with such artists such as Santa Feria and R\u00e1faga popularizing the cumbia villera movement. Another form of tropical music that emerged in the 2010s was tropical fusion, with groups such as Gente de Zona mixing tropical music with other urbano beats.\nUrbano/reggaeton\nJ Balvin emerged as one of reggaeton's most popular singers throughout the decade.Ozuna bec",
    "\nKen Buchanan vs. Roberto Dur\u00e1n was a professional boxing match contested on June 26, 1972, for the WBA and The Ring lightweight title.\nBackground\nIn May 1972, it was announced that the reigning WBA lightweight champion would face the number-one ranked contender Roberto Dur\u00e1n in Madison Square Garden on June 26th, two day before Buchanan's 27th birthday. Heavily anticipated, Buchanan was given a $125,000 purse, a then-record for a fighter in the lightweight division. Buchanan had first won the lightweight title in 1970 after defeating Dur\u00e1n's countryman Ismael Laguna, the win propelled Buchanan into one of the boxing's top fighters and he was named the top fighter of 1970 by the American Boxing Writers' Association. The 21-year old Dur\u00e1n,  meanwhile, was a perfect 28\u20130 with all but four of his wins coming by knockout and had quickly established himself as a top contender.\nThe brazen Dur\u00e1n predicted he would knockout the champion out \"in 9 rounds or less\", Buchanan however discredited Dur\u00e1n's impressive record claiming none of the fighters he had beaten previously had been a top fighter asking, \"Who's He Beaten?\u2019 He has a fair record, but he's not fought anybody. He's the No. 1 challenger, but who's he beaten? He's never fought anybody in the top ten. But the World Boxing Association told me I had to fight him because he's the No. 1 challenger. As long as he's legitimate, I'll fight the man.\"\nBuchanan entered the fight as a slight 2\u20131 favorite. The fight drew a crowd of 18,821 and produced a gate $223,901, a then-record for an indoor lightweight fight.\nThe fight\nDur\u00e1n would be named the winner by technical knockout in the 13th round, but the result was highly controversial. Serving as the aggressor, Dur\u00e1n was able to control the fight and had built up a sizeable lead on the judge's scorecards prior to the stoppage while Buchannan struggled to both offensively and defensively. Dur\u00e1n would score a first round flash knockdown (the only one of the fight) after landing a right hand that caused Buchanan to place his gloves on the mat to break his fall. As the 13th and final round came to an end, both fighters continued to throw punches after the bell had sounded just before referee Johnny LoBianco could separate the pair, Dur\u00e1n landed a low blow that sent Buchanan down to the mat in obvious pain. Buchanan was able to get back up but had to be helped to his corner and after being checked by LoBianco, it was determined that Buchanan could not continue and the fight was stopped with Dur\u00e1n being named the winner by technical knockout despite Buchanan's insistence that he could continue with the fight.\nBoth Dur\u00e1n and LoBianco maintained that Buchanan had been hit with a legal punch to the abdomen and not a low blow. Immediately after the fight LoBianco defended his decision explaining \"They fought after the bell, but the punch that put Buchanan down was in the abdomen, not any lower. It was impossible for him to continue. He was groaning in terrible pain. But it wasn't that punch alone, it was a culmination. Buchanan was unable to continue.\" Dur\u00e1n meanwhile, dismissed Buchanan's claims that he had won with an illegal blow stating \"A lot of boxers try to make you think they were hit low because they are losing. I won it legally.\" Buchanan insisted Dur\u00e1n had taken liberties in the fight not only with low blows, but also with headbutts and was critical of LoBianco's officiating claiming \"I got no protection from the referee. No matter where I put my head, his (Duran's) head was there and it was cracking.\" A post-fight examination by A. Harry Kleiman of the New York State Athletic Commission  backed up Buchanan's claims that he had been hit with a low blow confirming that Buchanan had \"swelling of the right testicle. He\u2019s in extreme pain.\"\nFight card\n^Note 1 For WBA and The Ring Lightweight titles\n",

    "Israeli attorney and diplomat (1892\u20131950)\nMordechai Eliash (Hebrew: \u05de\u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d0\u05e9), also spelled Mordecai Eliash, (1892-March 11, 1950) was an Israeli attorney and diplomat. At a time when most Zionists were not observant Jews, and most observant Jews were not Zionists, he quickly became one of the leading lawyers in Mandatory Palestine after his arrival in 1919. Amidst a rise in intercommunal violence, Eliash represented the Jewish community to the Shaw Commission in 1929, the Western Wall Commission in 1930, and the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry in 1946. \nAfter the establishment of the State of Israel, he was briefly the country's first representative to the United Nations, before his service as the first Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1948 until his death in 1950.\nBiography\nMordechai  Eliash was born in Uman, then part of the Russian Empire, in 1892. He received a religious Jewish education, before studying law and Oriental studies in Berlin and at Oxford University, where he received a B.Litt in 1919 with the thesis, The Risala of Shafi'i. In 1919, Eliash moved to Mandatory Palestine.\nActivities in Palestine\nAt a time when most Zionists were not observant Jews, and most observant Jews were not Zionists, he quickly became one of the leading lawyers in Mandatory Palestine. He served in the Jewish Agency's legal department and was a legal advisor to the Jewish National Council.\nWith the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the formation of Mandatory Palestine under British administration, there was an increase in activity among of the Hebrew Courts of Arbitration, and the Hebrew Law Society was newly reestablished in Palestine. Eliash, along with other prominent Jewish lawyers in Palestine, such as Norman Bentwich and Gad Frumkin joined the society, which published two scholarly journals and founded two legal presses. By 1925, Eliash was vice president of the society and co-editor of its journal Ha-Mishpat ha-'Ivri.\nAs president of the Jewish Bar Association, Eliash was a leader of the pro-Hebrew language camp in mandatory courts. A debate within the Jewish legal profession was whether the Hebrew language was essential to the development of a legal system in the Yishuv that was Jewish in the historical and cultural sense. Eliash implored Jewish lawyers to use Hebrew in court correspondence and sought sanctions against Jewish lawyers who did not use Hebrew. He allowed exception in cases involving non-Jews or in private appearances before the judiciary. However, even the heads of the Histadrut, normally zealous about their use of Hebrew, did not follow the decree to use Hebrew in court. Eliash also protested the use by courts of Arabic or English in the courtroom, even if the case involved Jews.\n1929 Palestine riots\nIn the aftermath of the 1929 Palestine riots in Jerusalem, a British court had sentenced Simcha Hinkis, a Jewish policeman, and Joseph Urphali to death for allegedly killing an Arab family during the riots. Eliash represented Hinkis and Urphali at trial. Both men won appeals of their sentences in 1930 and had their punishments commuted to prison time.\nEliash served as a witness to the Shaw Commission established by the British Mandatory government in December 1929 to investigate the Arab riots against the Jews.\n1930 Western Wall Commission\nEliash was the chief counsel representing the Jewish community to the 1930 Wailing Wall Commission set up by the League of Nations to investigate competing Muslim and Jewish claims to the Western Wall. He worked alongside David Yellin, Meer Berlin, Kook, Sonnenfeld, and Blau to present the Jewish case, largely based on the arguments of Cyrus Adler, then with the American Jewish Committee and the Jewish Theological Seminary.\nAnglo-American Committee of Inquiry\nEliash was the ranking member of a Jewish National Council delegation representing the Jews' position to the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. In oral arguments on March 14, 1946, he stressed to the committee that the Jews did not threaten Arab rights in Palestine, and it was the Jews who were subject to land and immigration restrictions.\nDiplomatic career\nAccording to Arab newspaper Al Youm, on November 27, 1947, days before the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Partition Plan for Palestine, the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini sent an emissary to Eliash, proposing secret direct talks between al-Husseini and the Jewish Agency. The Jews unanimously rejected entering into any talks with al-Husseini, who had provoked bloodshed against Jews and collaborated with Adolf Hitler during the Holocaust.\nOn the evening of May 14, 1948, the Israeli Declaration of Independence, Eliash was appointed as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations and was the first Israel envoy to speak for his government before the United Nations at Lake Success.\nOn February 14, 1949, Eliash was appointed as the first Israeli Ambassador to the United Kingdom. After Britain granted Israel de facto recogni",

    "2001 studio album by Mark Murphy\nLucky to Be Me is a studio album by Mark Murphy.\nLucky to Be Me is the 40th album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded in  when Murphy was 69 years old and released by the HighNote label in the United States in 2002. It is his third of five releases on HighNote. This album is a collection of standards and one original song by Mark Murphy performed with a jazz sextet.\nBackground\nDon Sickler, who worked with Murphy on Some Time Ago and Links returned as producer for Murphy's third project with HighNote. Lee Musiker also returned as arranger and pianist. Musiker was known for accompanying singers such as Chris Connor, Susannah McCorkle, Carol Sloane and Tony Bennett. Memo Acevedo, who also performed on Links, returned on percussion and Tim Horner returns on drums. Jay Leonhart and David Finck share duties on double bass. Trumpeter Scott Wendholt and Bobby Porcelli round out the sextet.\nRecording\nThe album opens with a medley of three song's from Leonard Bernstein's On the Town, set in New York City. The recording took place in New York not long after the 9/11 attacks. Murphy's said, \"I wanted to sing 'New York, New York' (from the song 'Lonely Town') first because right away those words trumpet New York and New Yorkers' courage in the wake of the tragedy of Sept. 11. I found these songs in books at the school where I taught in Graz, Austria, and in helping the students find material I was re-drawn to these three, all killer Bernstein songs.\"\n\"Dearly Beloved\" is a Johnny Mercer and Jerome Kern Oscar nominated song from the 1942 movie musical You Were Never Lovelier, where it was introduced by Fred Astaire. It lost the Academy Award for Best Original Song to Irving Berlin's \"White Christmas\" from Holiday Inn.\n\"Then I'll Be Tired of You\" by Arthur Schwartz and E.Y. Harburg had a special history with Murphy. Murphy said, \"When I got to New York in 1953 'Then I'll Be Tired of You' was one of the 'in' songs. I got into this little piano bar thing, a place that later moved around the corner and became Jilly's  . . . But when I started going there 'Then I'll Be Tired of You' was one of the cult hits of a guy named Nicky DeFrancis, who sang and played piano at this particular bar. He was something else. Played like Erroll Garner and was one of those South Philadelphia crooners, of the Italian style.\"\nMurphy often recorded Brazilian jazz and here he includes Jobim's \"Photograph (Fotografia)\". Murphy said, \"I don't think he ever got more tension out of fewer notes; I don't believe he used more than six or seven in the entire melody. It just encapsulates his genius\".\nMurphy considered himself a rhythm singer.  Murphy said,\" 'Dearly Beloved' and 'Serenade In Blue' have got natural drummers' rhythms.\" Referring to \"Serenade In Blue\" by Harry Warren and Mack Gordon, Murphy said, \"it becomes such a rhythmic romp that when you get to the bridge, when does it end? Certain songs invite rhythm, even though they might have been written for another era, you know?\"\n\"Just as Though You Were Here\" was a hit for Frank Sinatra and Pied Pipers with the Tommy Dorsey band. In the liner notes, Murphy dedicated the recording to a friend from England, \"for whom the song 'has deep personal meaning. Jesus, the way Lee  plays on that. I heard him 25 years ago when he came to San Francisco with Chris Connor, and it took me all that time to get him' \".\n\"I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart\" by David Lasley was a song Murphy heard \"on a jukebox in a bar near his home in the Poconos\". The recording was by Bonnie Raitt, with Herbie Hancock, on her 1989 three time Grammy award-winning album Nick of Time. Murphy said, \"I call it a country blues. I always tell my students to listen to this woman, because you can hear every word she sings.\"\nMurphy contributes an original composition, \"Blues for Frances Faye\". It was developed spontaneously in the studio. Murphy said it recalls a singer who, \"dared to be bizarre in the up-tight, button-down '50s. Did you ever see Bruce Weber's documentary 'Chop Suey'? Frances is in it, and so is that woman who used to run Vogue . It's so off-the-wall, I was in hysterics for practically half the film. I get the feeling that maybe Janis Joplin stumbled across Frances somewhere in a former life or something, and heard that extra-ballsy type singing\"\n\"I Wonder What Became of Me\" by Harold Arlen and Jonny Mercer was dropped from their musical St. Louis Woman. Along with No\u00ebl Coward's \"If Love Were All\", they form the final medley. Murphy fantasizes, \"I would end my last concert with them, then walk slo-o-o-w-l-y backward into a dimming spotlight. Or, if l've learned to levitate myself by then, l'd do that. There are a couple of Noel Coward songs, I suppose they're not really in my style, but they bring tears to my eyes every time I hear them\".\nMurphy explains his approach in the liner notes. Speaking about his hipster bebop image he says, \"I've grown beyond that, and my answer",
    "Mingma Norbu Sherpa (October 31, 1955 \u2013 September 23, 2006) was a pioneering figure in Himalayan conservation, renowned for his tireless efforts in environmental protection and sustainable natural resource management. Born in Khunde village within the Sherpa homeland of Khumbu (now Sagarmatha National Park), Mingma's upbringing amidst the breathtaking landscapes of the Himalayas instilled in him a deep reverence for nature.\nEarly Life and Education\nSherpa was born in the Khunde village. Due to his proficiency in several local languages and English, Mingma began working as a translator for visiting trekkers and conservationists in his teens. His remarkable aptitude and dedication caught the attention of Sir Edmund Hillary, the first Westerner to scale Mount Everest in 1953, who became his mentor.\nMingma was part of the inaugural class of the first school established by Hillary in the Everest region. He went on to graduate from Lincoln College (now under University of Canterbury) in 1980, receiving a diploma in Parks and Recreation. Continuing his academics, he earned a master's degree in natural resources management from the University of Manitoba in 1985.\nConservation Efforts\nMingma's commitment to conservation led him to become a key proponent of the conservation area concept in Nepal. Alongside Chandra Gurung, he played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Annapurna Conservation Area in 1985, where he later served as the first director. Recognizing the importance of local involvement in conservation efforts, Mingma advocated for empowering residents to assume full responsibility for conservation area management, as exemplified by the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area.\nCareer\nMingma's career trajectory underscored his unwavering dedication to environmental conservation. He began his tenure at Sagarmatha National Park as a ranger in 1980, quickly rising to become the park's first Sherpa warden within six months.\nIn 1989, he joined the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), where he directed programs in Nepal, Bhutan, and the Terai Arc region of Nepal and India. Among his numerous achievements, Mingma led initiatives to protect endangered wildlife, including the Bengal tiger and the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros.\nLegacy\nMingma's legacy continues to inspire future generations of conservationists. The annual Mingma Norbu Sherpa Community Engagement Fellowship, established in his honor, provides financial support to graduate and professional students conducting field study and engaged research in environmental areas. The fellowship reflects Mingma's belief that conservation efforts should harmonize with the well-being of local communities.\nMemorial scholarships\nIn commemoration of Mingma's invaluable contributions, various organizations have established scholarships and awards in his name. The Mingma Norbu Sherpa Memorial Scholarships, supported by WWF, Lincoln University, and the Greater Himalayan Foundation, assist Nepalese students pursuing careers in nature conservation. Mingma's influence extended beyond Nepal, as evidenced by his involvement with WWF's Tibet program, where he played a pivotal role in shaping public opinion on environmental conservation issues.\nPersonal life and death\nMingma Norbu Sherpa, affectionately known as \"Mingma\" within conservation circles, was revered for his modesty and selflessness. His life was cut short in a helicopter crash on September 23, 2006, along with 23 other conservationists. His untimely passing was mourned by his family, colleagues, and the global conservation community. Mingma is survived by his wife and their two children.\nRecognition\nIn recognition of his outstanding contributions to conservation, Mingma Norbu Sherpa was posthumously awarded the Order of the Golden Ark Award by His Royal Highness Prince Bernard of the Netherlands. This prestigious accolade celebrated Mingma's enduring legacy and his profound impact on Himalayan conservation efforts.\nSee also\nEdmund Hillary\nChandra Gurung\n",
    "Military campaign of Demetrius Poliorcetes\nAfter the disaster of the Battle of Ipsus, Demetrius I Poliorcetes launched a campaign of raids in the Thracian Chersonese in 300-299 BCE. These raids, directed against Lysimachus, were a last-ditch effort by the Antigonid to rebuild his forces and buy time to avoid complete annihilation.\nHe contested Lampsacus with Lysimachus and captured it at least twice, without occupying it. During this campaign, Demetrius won skirmishes with his troops and managed to establish a complete blockade of the Hellespont. Aided by the emerging dissensions among the victorious Diadochi of Ipsus, he left the Thracian Chersonese for the Middle East in 299-298 BCE, where he reunited with his former enemy, Seleucus I, to whom he gave his daughter Stratonice in marriage. Overall, his very precarious position was strengthened by this campaign, which restored him among the Diadochian powers and allowed him to rebuild his troops and a portion of his prestige.\nBackground\nThe Battle of Ipsus was a disaster for the Antigonids; their army, encountering the combined forces of Seleucus and Lysimachus on the battlefield, was completely destroyed. Demetrius was not a stranger to this defeat: he broke through the enemy lines and advanced decisively against Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, but this cut him off from the main battle, and he had to witness, helplessly, the complete destruction of the Antigonid phalanx and the death of his father. Antigonus I, a central figure in the Wars of the Diadochi and one of the main contenders for Alexander's succession, indeed met his end on the battlefield. Antigonus's death finalized the decisive defeat of the Antigonids and placed Demetrius in a very difficult position.\nOperations\nFlight\nGeopolitical situation before the Battle of Ipsus\nDemetrius assessed the lost situation of the battle and the death of Antigonus, then fled the battlefield. This was a pragmatic choice aimed at preserving the remnants of the available Antigonid power. While the victorious Diadochi gathered to divide Antigonus's lands, Demetrius rushed westward and quickly headed toward Ephesus. Plutarch states that Demetrius had less than ten thousand soldiers remaining, a minimal fraction of the Antigonid forces before the battle. Clearly, Demetrius aimed to extract himself from Anatolia as swiftly as possible; indeed, he found part of his well-preserved fleet in the city, allowing him to reengage in the Hellenistic and Aegean world and to reach the two remaining centers of his power, Athens and Cyprus. Despite the wavering loyalty of his troops, who threatened to plunder the city's temple, Demetrius managed to have them embark without major issues.Geopolitical situation after the Battle of IpsusThe subsequent events are difficult to establish, but it seems that Demetrius intended to go to Athens, where part of his fleet remained. However, the city declared that he was no longer welcome. He retrieved his fleet and \"solidified\" his position somewhat, according to Plutarch, though it is unclear what this entailed\u2014probably a short period of consolidation and administration of the territories still under his control. During this period, he likely went to Corinth to recruit mercenaries, and despite the division of his territories and the loss of Athens, he managed to maintain control over Ephesus, certain cities in Phoenicia, Cyprus, and some islands in the Aegean Sea. In Ephesus, specifically, he thwarted a betrayal attempt by the leader of the garrison during this period.\nHe then set out for the Thracian Chersonese and began to ravage the territories of Lysimachus.\nStrategic choices and Campaign\nThe fact that Demetrius chose to attack Lysimachus, specifically targeting the Thracian Chersonese, was a strategically sound decision by the Epigone. He likely selected this Diadochus because Lysimachus had inherited a significant portion of the former Antigonid territories in Anatolia. Furthermore, Lysimachus, being the most isolated and the most dangerous to his peers, made an ideal target for Demetrius. Demetrius and Lysimachus also had a long-standing personal rivalry. Additionally, Demetrius could utilize his well-preserved fleet to secure control of the Hellespont, thereby threatening Thrace and obstructing any attempts by Lysimachus to seize Anatolian lands, exploiting the geographical division of Lysimachus's territory between Europe and Asia. This fleet undoubtedly enhanced Demetrius's mobility, and it seems that he crossed the Hellespont with his troops multiple times, capturing Lampsacus at least twice without holding it permanently, indicating his lack of interest in territorial conquest at that moment. At this time, his fleet likely consisted of around 170 auxiliary ships, theoretically allowing him to transport more than 40,000 people, far more than his actual troops.\nAfter disembarking his troops, still vastly outnumbered, he embarked on a campaign of asymmetric warfare while enforcing a c",
    "Mountain summit in Utah, United States\nReids Peak is an 11,724-foot-elevation (3,573-meter) mountain summit in Summit County, Utah, United States.\nDescription\nReids Peak is located 50 miles (80\u00a0km) east of Salt Lake City in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. It is situated in the western Uinta Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains north into headwaters of the Weber River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 2,300 feet (701 meters) above the Weber River in one mile (1.6\u00a0km). Access to the mountain is via the Mirror Lake Highway. The mountain was first named \"Reeds Peak\" in 1875, and the present spelling of the toponym was officially adopted in 1932 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The peak is named after an early explorer of this region. William \"Toopeechee\" Reed was an early pioneer of this region who founded Reed Trading Post in 1828, making this the first permanent non-Indian residence and business in what would become the State of Utah.\nGeology\nReids Peak is composed of metasedimentary rock of the Mount Watson Formation. Fluvial sediment processes deposited a sequence of nearly white quartz arenite and subarkose interbedded with minor amounts of pale-red arkosic arenite and grayish-green shale during the Late Precambrian. The Uintas were uplifted during the Laramide orogeny about 70 to 50 million years ago. The area around Reids Peak and Bald Mountain became an ice cap during glaciation of the Ice age, transforming these peaks into nunataks. Numerous glacial cycles during the Quaternary Period sculpted the peak and scoured the surrounding land forming many depressions that are now lakes. Viewed from the summit, as many as 70 lakes can be counted.\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Reids Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold snowy winters and mild summers. Tundra climate characterizes the summit and highest slopes.\nSee also\nGeology of the Uinta Mountains\nList of mountains in Utah\nGallery\nNorth aspect of Reids Peak (center), with Bald Mountain (left).

    "Convent in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain\nThe Convento de las Br\u00edgidas (Basque: Brigiden komentua) is a former Bridgettine convent in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country, Spain. The  convent, whose current building dates from the early 20th century, has been vacant since 2007.\nHistory\nThe earliest documental evidence of the convent dates from 1291. The document is an agreement between the city of Vitoria and the Brotherhood of Arriaga\u00a0 in which Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena was mentioned as marking the borders of the city. At the time the site was a leper hospital operated by the Order of Saint Lazarus. The earliest municipal documents mentioning the hospital, from 1480, called it Casa de la Magdalena. In 1575 the decision was taken to convert the hospital into a convent, with the first Discalced Carmelites arriving in 1589.\nRelations between the Carmelite nuns and the city were contentious, often requiring the intervention of the nuncio. As a consequence, on 15 March 1653, the Bridgettines arrived to the city to replace the Carmelites. The Bridgettine convent in Lasarte-Oria\u00a0 was founded in 1671 by nuns from Vitoria. The Convent of Santa Br\u00edgida\u00a0 in Mexico City was also founded by Bridgettines from Vitoria in 1739.\nThe old convent was demolished in 1906 to make room for the construction of the New Cathedral. The new convent was built from 1907 to 1909 under the direction of Fausto \u00cd\u00f1iguez de Betolaza. The neoclassical fa\u00e7ade of the old convent, dating from 1783, was dismantled and rebuilt at the new site. The convent has been vacant since 2007, when the last remaining nuns relocated to Valladolid. A proposal was made in 2022 to turn the premises into a hospice, but the plans were dropped in early 2024.\nArchitecture\nThe most notable element of the convent is the Neoclassical fa\u00e7ade designed by Olagu\u00edbel in 1783, originally flanked by two Ionic columns. The church itself has a floor plan in the shape of a Latin cross with very short arms. Its vault is painted with frescoes by local painter Lucio Ruiz. The main altarpiece was purpose-built for the new convent, but the lateral ones were originally from the old one.\n",
    "Chinese-indigenous descended ethnic group of Sabah, Malaysia\nEthnic group\nThe Sino-Native, often referred to simply as Sino, represent a population with a diverse background resulting from marriages between the Chinese community and indigenous people in Sabah. They are distinguished by their mixed genealogical heritage, resulting in a fusion of oriental and local cultures. This blending of traditions has given rise to distinct sub-groups within the Sino community, such as Sino-Kadazan, Sino-Dusun or Sino-Murut, each reflecting a unique combination of Chinese and indigenous influences.\nAnalogus to other Peranakans of Maritime Southeast Asia, the Sino-Natives embody a unique cultural blend resulting from intermarriages between Chinese and the indigenous peoples of Sabah. This cultural synthesis is evident in various aspects of their lives, including language, cuisine, customs and religious practices.\nCultural nomenclature\nThe term \"Sino\" is often rendered in Malaysian Mandarin as \"B\u00e0n t\u00e1ng f\u0101n\" (\u534a\u5510\u756a, which translates to \"half Chinese and half Native\"). Similarly, terms like Peranakan, Peranakan Cina and Peranakan Tionghua, mostly used by older Sino generations, also highlight this unique identity. These designations emphasize the unique identity of the Sino-Natives, showcasing their distinctiveness from multiple cultural angles.\nWhile \"Sino\" commonly refers to denote individuals with mixed Chinese and Kadazan-Dusun or Murut heritage, it is occasionally extended for other biracial Sabahan people that have Chinese ancestry, such as Sino-Bajau, Sino-Brunei and Sino-Bisaya. However, such extensions are rare and occur infrequently within Sabah's diverse ethnic landscape, underscoring the complexities of identity in the region.\nHistory\nHistorical Intermarriage\nA Chinese junk in Kinabatangan, North Borneo\nThe historical practice of intermarriage between Kadazans and Chinese can be traced back to the mid-18th century, specifically between the 1760s and 1790s. During this period, the Brunei Sultanate played a pivotal role in facilitating the migration of thousands of Chinese farmers to Sabah, with the aim of bolstering pepper cultivation for the global market. These Chinese farmers, backed by Bruneian landlords, embarked on establishing pepper plantations along the west coast of Sabah, marking a significant economic and cultural exchange between the Chinese and local communities.\nBritish explorer Dalrymple provided early documentation of this phenomenon, noting in his records that around 50 Chinese individuals from Brunei and the local Dusun community cohabited at the mouth of the Tuaran River on Sabah's western shores. This coexistence and collaboration in agricultural endeavors laid the foundation for subsequent interactions and intermarriages between the Chinese immigrants and the indigenous Kadazan communities, shaping the demographic and cultural landscape of the region.\nIn 1776, explorer Thomas Forrest further documented the presence of Chinese-operated pepper plantations, this time at the mouth of the Putatan River. His accounts shed light on the expanding role of Chinese settlers in the agricultural activities of the area, highlighting their significant contribution to Sabah's economic development during that era. These historical narratives underscore the enduring legacy of intercultural exchanges and intermarriages that have profoundly influenced the social fabric and heritage of Sabah's diverse population.\nEmergence of Sino-Natives\nIn a broader context, the intertwining of Chinese and indigenous communities in North Borneo (Sabah) has given rise to diverse Sino-Native groups. This development illustrates the dynamic cultural exchanges that have shaped the region's identity.\nThe earliest documented mention of the Sino-Natives dates back to Spenser St. John's account in 1862. St. John, who served as the British Consul to Brunei at that time, chronicled the migration of Chinese traders from Labuan to Bundu and the Klias Peninsula. These migrants intermarried with native families, leading to the emergence of the Tatanas or Sino-Dusuns, a community that has retained significant Chinese cultural influences. St. John noted that many of the descendants claimed Chinese ancestry and were proficient in the Hokkien dialect, showcasing the cultural fusion resulting from these unions.\nIn his extensive study \"Pagans of North Borneo,\" Owen Rutter provided a detailed analysis of how Chinese culture has profoundly influenced the Bundu Dusuns. He meticulously explored the unique Chinese cultural elements embedded within this particular group, emphasizing their distinctive characteristics compared to other Dusun communities across North Borneo. Rutter's research underscored the substantial impact of historical intermarriages and ongoing cultural exchanges on the Bundu Dusuns, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of cultural assimilation and hybridization within the region.\nIn a more contemporary context, Monica Glyn-Jones,",
    "\nThe Yokotashimo Kofun (\u6a2a\u7530\u4e0b\u53e4\u58b3)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the Hamatama neighborhood of the city of Karatsu, Saga Prefecture Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1951.\nOverview\nThe Yokotashimo Kofun is an enpun (\u5186\u58b3)-style circular burial mound, with an estimated diameter of about 30 meters, located on a hill about 60 meters above sea level at the eastern foot of Mount Kagamiyama, which is located almost in the center of the Karatsu Plain facing Karatsu Bay. It was discovered in 1924 when the owner of the land dug up the passage to the stone chamber while clearing a forest, and discovered the grave goods when he opened the sarcophagus inside. The horizontal-type stone burial chamber opens to the south and is divided into a passageway and a rear chamber. The  rear chamber is about 4 meters long, 2.25 meters wide and 2.34 meters high and gradually narrows towards the top, reaching a ceiling on consisting of three huge stones.  It was constructed using broken basalt stones and granite, and the entire wall is painted with red pigment. Part of the western wall of the passageway has been destroyed, but what is thought to be the gate remains in its original state and is blocked by a single slab of stone. Inside the burial chamber are three stone sarcophagi made of flat slabs, with the first stone sarcophagus adjacent to the back wall having a cover stone, and the stone on the south side forming the northern wall of the second stone sarcophagus which is parallel to it, and the third stone sarcophagus placed separately, parallel to the western wall of the antechamber.  Grave goods include a round and a square bronze mirror, magatama in the first sarcophagus, cylindrical copperware, iron arrowheads, and a short armor in the second sarcophagus, and Haji ware pottery in the third sarcophagus, as well as the bones of eight people.  The burial mound is of a common form, but the style of the burial chamber and layout of the stone coffins is unique in kofun which have been excavated to date.   The grave goods designated are a Saga Prefectural Tangible Cultural Property. \nThe tumulus is about a 25-minute walk from Hamasaki Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuhi Line.\nSee also\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Saga)\n",

    "Australian artist (1906\u20131998)\nMaidie McGowan (n\u00e9e MacWhirter) (1906\u20131998) was an Australian artist.\nBiography\nMcGowan was born in England in 1906, and arrived in Victoria in 1920 as a teenager. She studied art at the National Gallery School under W.B. McInnes, later doing weekend classes at George Bell's Bourke Street studio in the 1930s. She studied at the Gallery School at the same time as Sybil Craig, Constance Stokes, and Helen Ogilvie, though they were in different classes. Her mother didn't want her to continue studying art, and got her to go work at a flower shop instead. Bernard Hall allowed her to continue studying part time, a privilege not afforded to many at the time.\nShe first exhibited with The New Group at the Athenaeum Gallery in 1937, at a show consisting of still-life, landscape, and drawings. The group consisted of artists Albert Tucker and Hal Porter, and Maidie's work The Portrait of Minka was considered second only to Tucker. A review of the show in The Herald by Basil Burdett described her work as showing real promise. McGowan's portrait Manya featured in the Herald Exhibition 'Outstanding Artists of 1937' and alongside Thea Proctor's article in Art in Australia.\nMcGowan attended classes at the Victorian Artists Society with her future husband Colin around this time. She was a founding member of the Contemporary Art Society and later a three-terms President of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Her and Colin married in 1948 and moved to Mount Eliza, mostly withdrawing from the art scene. They later returned in 1954 by invitation to help launch the Peninsula Arts Society. She was encouraged to return to practicing art during this time by George Bell, returning to his classes while also teaching art at Mount Eliza.\nColin worked in printing at an advertising firm, and Maidie's work Collage of Screenprinted Paper was made out of posters he screenprinted. She would gift this work to Bell on his 80th birthday. In the 1960s McGowan would become the first secretary of the McClelland Gallery Group, with Colin printing and designing the invitations and catalogues. The group's membership included artists such as Daryl Lindsay. Her work and experience led to her assisting in curation for two exhibitions at the National Gallery of Victoria in the 1960s and 1970s.\nExhibitions\nApril\u2013May 1978, Paintings of Figure and Landscape by Maidie McGowan, Clive Parry Galleries\nApril\u2013May 1988, George Bell Students & Friends, Holland Fine Art\nOctober 1988, Jim Alexander Gallery Spring Exhibition\nMay\u2013June 1990, Modern Australian Paintings, Bridget McDonnell Gallery (with Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd, Charles Blackman)\nFurther reading\nMaidie McGowan retrospective\u00a0: November 4, 1995 \u2013 January 7, 1996, State Library Victoria\nForm and flowers\u00a0: Maidie McGowan, Anne Montgomery, Marjorie Woolcock, State Library Victoria\nNew Group, Melbourne, Vic.\u00a0: Australian Gallery File, State Library Victoria\nMaidie McGowan\u00a0: Australian Art and Artists file, Art Gallery of New South Wales Research Library and Archive\nBiographical cuttings on Maidie McGowan, National Library of Australia\n",
    "Village in South Governorate\nChehabiyeh (Arabic: \u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629), also spelled Shehabiya or ech-Chehabiye, formerly Teir Zinbeh (Arabic: \u0637\u064a\u0631\u0632\u0628\u0646\u0627), is a village located in the South Governorate of Lebanon, located in the Tyre District. Chehabiyeh is home to a significant Shi'a Muslim population, consistent with most of southern Lebanon.\nChehabiyeh faces multiple challenges, including waste management issues and waste burning in local dumps. Iranian-backed political party and militant group Hezbollah is active in the village, and in 2024, a senior member of the Redwan Force was killed in an airstrike.\nName\nThe town was originally known as \"Teir Zinbeh,\" but was renamed \"Shehabiya\" in 1968 in honor of former Lebanese President Fouad Chehab. This name change was initiated by Ibrahim Muhiddin Baydoun, a prominent local leader who had a close friendship with Chehab. The official name change was enacted through a law passed by the Lebanese Parliament on January 6, 1968.\nChehab was a member of the noble Chehab dynasty, an Arab family that held significant influence in the region. The dynasty's name itself is derived from the Arabic word \"\u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628\" (Shihab), which means \"shooting star\" or \"meteor.\"\nThe name \"Chehabiyeh\" (also spelled \"Shehabiya\" or \"Ech Chehabiye\") is the English form of the Arabic word \"\u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629\" (Shah\u0101b\u012byah). \nGeography\nThe village is situated at an elevation of approximately 422 meters (1,385 feet) above sea level. Chehabiyeh is close to several other localities, including Kfar Dounin and Selaa. It is part of the Tyre District, which is one of the administrative divisions within the South Governorate.\nHistory\nIn 1875, Victor Gu\u00e9rin noted on Their Zibna: \"This village contains a great number of cut stones, dispersed, coming from an ancient church now destroyed. On the base of a pillar once belonging to this building, I remarked two Greek crosses extremely well sculptured.\" He estimated that the village had 400 Metawileh inhabitants.\nIn 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Teir Zinbeh as: \"A village, built of stone, containing about 300 Metawileh, situated on a ridge, with figs, olives, pomegranates, and arable land round. Water supply from spring and cisterns.\"\nOn April 16, 2024, an airstrike in the area targeted and eliminated Muhammad Hussein Mustafa Sh'houri, a commander of the rocket and missile unit of Hezbollah's Redwan Force.\nServices\nOne of the prominent landmarks in the area is the Saint Peter Hospital, which serves as a key healthcare facility for the local population. The hospital is an important institution in the region, providing medical services to residents of Chehabiyeh and neighboring villages.\nFurthermore, the village is in proximity to several other localities and landmarks, including the UNP 9-1 military facility located approximately 3.5 kilometers northeast of Chehabiyeh. This facility is part of the United Nations peacekeeping operations in the region.\nInfrastructural challenges\nChehabiyeh faces several infrastructural challenges, particularly in the areas of waste management and public services.\nOne of the critical issues in Chehabiyeh is waste management. The village has struggled with inadequate resources and delayed disbursements from the central government, leading to reliance on open dumping and burning of waste. This practice has significant environmental and health implications for the local population. The municipality has sought support from international agencies and the central government to improve waste management facilities, but consistent financial and technical support remains a challenge.\nWater infrastructure in Chehabiyeh has seen some improvements through international aid programs. For instance, the WISE-Lebanon program rehabilitated the Chehabiyeh pump station.\n",
    "\nThe Alioune Blondin Beye Peacekeeping School of Bamako (EMP) is a center in Mali designed to train African civilian and military leaders in peace support operations (PSO), at both fundamental and tactical levels.\nThe EMP is part of two main networks. The first is ECOWAS, within which three centers provide PSO training: the National War College in Nigeria (strategic level), the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre in Ghana (operational level), and the EMP in Bamako (tactical level). The second is the African Peace Support Trainers Association (APSTA).\nThough it is the only center for PSO in the Francophone region, the instruction is bilingual (French-English) to best meet the linguistic realities of the continent and the multinational nature of PSO. Trainees come from all African states, either nominated by their administrations or volunteering after their applications are reviewed. Courses are open to both men and women.\nHistory\nInitiated as part of French military cooperation, the school was established in 1999 through an initial partnership between C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and France. Initially located in Zambakro, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, it trained over 600 trainees, primarily as brigade or battalion staff officers and military observers. Following internal conflict in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the partnership was interrupted and re-established with the Republic of Mali. After a six-month hiatus, the EMP resumed instruction at the camp in Koulikoro, 60\u00a0km northeast of Bamako. In April 2007, it moved to the Malian capital in modern facilities built with international community support, totaling around 8 million euros. Contributions came from: France 32%, Mali 23%, Netherlands 13%, Germany 13%, Canada 9%, Switzerland 4%, United Kingdom 3%, Denmark 2%, United States 1%.\nThe school's status changed during the transfer; it is now a Malian law school attached to the Minister of Defense and Veterans Affairs, with autonomous multinational funding under the control of a board of directors comprising representatives from contributing countries. It is led by a Malian general. Since its relocation to Mali, it has trained nearly 7,300 African officers, police officers, and civilians as of September 2013. Partnerships with organizations like the United Nations and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) have expanded the courses to include areas such as Human Rights, Gender studies, and the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) process.\nIn 2007, the school was named in memory of Alioune Blondin Beye, a Malian professor, lawyer, and politician who served as Minister of Youth, Sports, Arts and Culture, and later as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mali. He was also a member of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights. During the Angolan civil war, he was appointed in June 1993 as the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG). He led the UN Verification Mission (UNAVEM II and UNAVEM III) from June 1993 to June 1997, and the UN Observer Mission (MONUA) from July 1997 to June 1998. He tragically died in a plane crash off the coast of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire on June 26, 1998, while on a UN mission.\nThe events in Mali since March 2012, including a military mutiny and the invasion of the north, significantly disrupted the EMP's operations due to the cessation of funding by most international donors. Following the French military operation Operation Serval in early 2013 and the gradual return to democracy, many countries have expressed a desire to renew their support for this unique institution that contributes to the education of African leaders. The EMP plans to establish a Sahel-Saharan Analysis and Research Center between 2013 and 2018, as part of a five-year strategic plan. This future center aims to provide better understanding of the Sahel region and its characteristics through direct-source studies, attracting researchers, doctoral candidates, and African students from universities across the continent.\nAlthough the school remains commanded by a Malian general officer and its board of directors, which determines its policies and operations, is chaired by the Malian Minister of Defense and Veterans Affairs, the ambassadors of contributing countries, as ex-officio members of the board, play an active role in defining and validating the school's general policy.\nList of Commandants\nMalian Directors\n2007\u20132012: Brigadier General Souleymane Y.

    "Quasar in the constellation Caelum\nPKS 0451-28 (full name PKS 0451-282), also known as MRC 0451-282, is a quasar located in the constellation of Caelum. Its redshift is 2.55, estimating the object to be located nearly 10.8 billion light-years away from Earth.\nCharacteristics\nObserved by the 20-GHz Australia Telescope Compact Array radio survey, PKS 0451-28 is classified as a blazar. It is a type of an active extragalactic object launching out a relativistic astrophysical jet towards the direction of Earth with the observer's line of sight.\nThe emitted radiation from PKS 0451-28 shows a strong variability across its entire electro-magnetic spectrum. As a source of non-thermal emission, from radio to high energy (HE; >100 MeV) or very high energy (VHE; >100 GeV) \u03b3-ray bands, the jets of PKS 0451-28 are known to cover the entire spectrum. This tend to vary in a short time-scales such as in minute scales within the \u03b3-ray band causing an increase in luminosity. The flux variation in PKS 0451\u201328, the observed superluminal motion, high degrees of polarization, and other features observed are explained by the relativistic beaming effects.\nMoreover, PKS 0451-28 is a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ). It has a strong emission lines (EW >5 \u00c5) and contains a powerful radio source observed by NuSTAR, with a visual magnitude of 16.7 and redshift of 0.9, which its radio fluxes have been catalogued at 1.8 Jy at 5\u00a0GHz and 3 Jy at 31\u00a0GHz respectively.\nObservations of PKS 0451-28\nAccording to researchers, the \u03b3-ray luminosity in PKS 0451-28 is found to exceed 1048\u2009erg\u2009s\u22121 with the highest \u03b3-ray luminosity of (5.54 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 1048\u2009erg\u2009s\u22121, that is estimated for another blazar, B3 1343+451. Naturally, compared to the distribution of all BL Lacs and FSRQs that are considered \u03b3-ray-emitting, in the \u0393\u03b3\u2212L\u03b3 plane, the blazars observed, are considered to occupy the highest luminosity range.\nInterestingly, PKS 0451-28 appears as a bright X-ray emitter, but however does not have signs of distinguishable features in the X-ray band, only having a flux and photon index similar to those of the other considered sources in blazars. Along with other studied blazars like PKS 0537-286, PKS 1351-108, PKS 0438-43, PKS 0834-20 and TXS 0222+185, a thermal blue-bump component is found in PKS 0451\u201328, suggesting emission directly from its disc.\nResearchers also noted the X-ray flux in PKS 0451-28 is known to be consistent, remaining at (9.52 \u00b1 1.21) \u00d7 10\u221214 erg\u2009cm\u22122\u2009s\u22121 compared to a few blazars like PKS 0438\u221243, whose X-ray flux was in a bright X-ray state on December 15, 2016, with a flux of (1.09 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d7 10\u221211\u2009erg\u2009cm\u22122\u2009s\u22121 as compared with the flux of (1.30 \u00b1 0.31) \u00d7 10\u221211\u2009erg\u2009cm\u22122\u2009s\u22121 in the quiescent state.\nMoreover, the adaptively binned light curves for PKS 0451-28 shows show several episodes of \u03b3-rays brightening, whereas the \u03b3-ray flux increase within day scales is observed. The peak \u03b3-ray flux of (2.20 \u00b1 0.50) \u00d7 10\u22127\u2009photon\u2009cm\u22122\u2009s\u22121 in PKS 0451-28 is found to be above 163.2 MeV. During the observation, it has a MJD of 56968.60 \u00b1 0.79 with 9.64\u03c3, corresponding to a flux of (3.70 \u00b1 0.84) \u00d7 10\u22127\u2009photon\u2009cm\u22122\u2009s\u22121 above 100 MeV. During this period, \u0393\u03b3 was 2.06 \u00b1 0.19. This shows only the photon index of PKS 0451-28 varies in time; the variation is highly significant in which the blazar shows a value of P(\u03c72) \u2264 10\u22125.\nDisc luminosity\nThe disc luminosity of PKS 0451-28 is estimated to be Ld \u2243 (1.09\u221210.94) \u00d7 1046\u2009erg\u2009s\u22121 according to researchers calculating the energetics of the considered source for the blazar by using modelling results.\nSupermassive black hole and jet luminosity\nThe supermassive black hole in PKS 0451-28 has a solar mass of within (1.69\u22125.35) \u00d7 109\u2009M\u2299 as calculated by researchers through a traditional virial method. Around 5\u201316 percent is contributed by the Eddington luminosity.\nAs for jet power in PKS 0451\u201328, it is in the form of the magnetic field (LB) and relativistic electrons (Le). Researchers calculated the jet power as L = \u03c0R2c\u2009\u03932Ui, where Ui is either electron (Ue) or magnetic field (UB) energy density. Furthermore, the jet luminosity (defined as L = Le + LB) is \u22641.41 \u00d7 1046\u2009erg\u2009s\u22121 for PKS 0451\u201328. It is found to be lower compared to the disc Ld \u2243 (1.09\u221210.94) \u00d7 1046\u2009erg\u2009s\u22121 although it has a significant correlation with the broad-line luminosity in the blazar, hence supporting the theory of jet power having a closer bond with accretion.\nThe jet power is found to have an approximate value of logLBLR \u223c (0.98 \u00b1 0.07)logPjet for all blazars including PKS 0451\u201328. The values are consistent with the theoretical predicted coefficient of logLBLR-logLjet relation. Results do support the jets in blazars like PKS 0451\u201328, are powered by energy extraction from both accretion and black hole spin as observed by Fermi. This finds PKS 0451-28 is a powerful blazar with high luminosity and of the same order calculated for other blazars studied both distant and nearby since the jet power do not differ substantially and those that are usua",
    "Spanish silversmith and noble from Logro\u00f1o\nJos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano (1561\u20131622) was a Navarrese noble and artist from the House of Medrano in Logro\u00f1o and the most significant silversmith of his time during the Spanish Golden Age.\nBackground\n1568 Coat of arms of the House of Medrano: Ave Maria legend on sable border, gules field, goshawk in the hand of the progenitor, a hollow cross in Or of Calatrava\nDon Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano was born in Logro\u00f1o, La Rioja. He belongs to the illustrious and influential House of Medrano. Don Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano has been credited as being one of the best examples of Spanish silversmith's craft at the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century.\nMarriage\nOriginally from Logro\u00f1o, Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano completed his apprenticeship in Pamplona under Don Felipe de Guevara, whose daughter he married.\nApprenticeship\nDon Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano completed his apprenticeship in the home of his father-in-law, who had practiced his craft in Castile and Aragon before settling in Navarre and opening a workshop in Pamplona, as stated in his own declaration from 1571. However, there has been no verifiable evidence of Felipe de Guevara's presence in Aragon, despite documentation of other silversmiths with the same surname.\nMedrano's silversmith workshop in Arga\nDon Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano continued in Guevara's workshop until the latter's death in 1588. Subsequently, he completed some of Guevara's unfinished projects, often overshadowing Guevara's son, Hernando, who was also a silversmith. This situation reportedly caused tensions, prompting Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano to establish his own workshop for gold and silversmithing. Medrano quickly gained a reputation as the leading silversmith in the city of Arga and expanded his influence into the regions of Aragon, leaving behind some of his most noteworthy works.\nIt's likely that the Guevara family facilitated Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano's introduction to the Aragonese episcopal circles during a period when the local silver workshops, prominent throughout the century, were in decline. \nAttorney\nIn a related note from 31 December 1594, Margarita Marcuello appointed Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano as her attorney. Documented as residing in Pamplona and currently in Tarazona, he was responsible for managing the inheritance of her brother, the silversmith Juan D\u00edez Marcuello, who had recently passed away in the capital of Navarre.\nArtistic Contributions\nThe master silversmith Don Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano's significant works primarily include a series of stationary monstrances and Eucharistic pavilions. These pieces, created between 1594 and 1608, reflect the heightened importance of Eucharistic worship in the Spanish Church post-Trent Council. His craftsmanship is particularly noted in several major works. Jose's work has been described by historians as a synthesis between the classicist aesthetic driven by El Escorial, assimilated from the treatise by Juan de Arphe y Villafa\u00f1e, and the practice more concerned with highlighting the plastic values of the architecture typical of Romanist altarpieces, which had a distinguished creative center in Navarre.\nPortrait of Juan de Arphe. Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano is recognized and elevated to the ranks of the finest \"sculptors of silver and gold\" who were shaped by Juan de Arphe y Villafa\u00f1e\nAll of Medrano's works are distinguished by their high technical quality, showcasing both intelligent and detailed architectural design as well as comprehensive iconographic schemes related to the Eucharist. Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano's works are distinguished by their technical quality and architectural design, which includes extensive iconographic programs. His ability to combine practical craftsmanship with theoretical knowledge allowed him to achieve significant standing among his contemporaries. According to historians, these qualities elevate Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano to the ranks of the finest \"sculptors of silver and gold\" who were shaped by Juan de Arphe y Villafa\u00f1e (b. 1535, active 1564\u20131603). Solid proof of Medrano's proficiency in drawing is demonstrated by Bishop Antonio Zapata y Mendoza (1596\u20131600), who commissioned him to design the main altarpiece for the Pamplona Cathedral in 1597, contrary to the previously suggested year of 1598.\nDon Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1zquez de Medrano's influence extended beyond Navarre to Aragon, where his works were commissioned and appreciated. His ability to adapt his training and theoretical knowledge into practical and revered ecclesiastical art cemented his legacy as the most significant figure in Spanish silversmithing during his time.\nWhile many of Medrano's creations are no longer extant, it is documented that he crafted the parish crosses for Santa Mar\u00eda de Tafalla, Mendavia, Falces, Iroz, Lerruz, and Iragui, none of which have survived.\nPreserved works\nSome of Medrano's preserved works include the chrismatories of Arr\u00f3niz, completed before 1610, and two of the fo",
    "Future Intel microprocessor\nLunar Lake is the codename for the upcoming Series 2 Core Ultra processors designed by Intel, set for release in the second half of 2024. It is set to follow on from Meteor Lake which saw Intel move from monolithic silicon to a disaggregated MCM design. Meteor Lake was limited to a mobile release while Arrow Lake includes both socketable desktop and mobile processors.\nBackground\nOn May 24, 2024, details on the Lunar Lake architecture were unveiled during Intel's Computex presentation in Taiwan. SKU names of Lunar Lake processors or details such as clock speeds were not announced.\nArchitecture\nLunar Lake is an ultra-low power mobile SoC design. It is a successor to 15W Meteor Lake-U processors while Arrow Lake replaces the midrange 28W Meteor Lake-H processors. Lunar Lake's focus on low power efficiency targets premium ultra-thin laptops and compact mobile designs. Intel said that with Lunar Lake, it aimed to \"bust the myth that  can't be as efficient\" as ARM.\nProcess node\nLunar Lake is the first processor design by Intel where all logic dies are entirely fabricated on external nodes outsourced to TSMC. An analysis by Goldman Sachs indicated that Intel would be spending $5.6 billion in 2024 and $9.7 billion in 2025 outsourcing to TSMC. In March 2024, Intel's chief financial officer admitted during an investment call that the company was \"a little bit heavier than we want to be in terms of external wafer manufacturing versus internal\". The following month, Intel disclosed that their foundry business made a $7 billion operating loss during 2023.\nCompute tile\nThe Compute tile is Lunar Lake's largest tile. It has expanded functions over Meteor Lake's compute tile which solely housed CPU cores and cache. Instead, Lunar Lake's compute tile houses CPU cores and their cache, the GPU and the NPU. The previous generation Meteor Lake used the Intel 4 process on its compute tile while Lunar Lake moves to TSMC's N3B node. N3B is TSMC's first generation 3\u00a0nm node with lower yields compared to the updated N3E node. Lunar Lake's compute tile was originally planned to be built on Intel's 18A node. 18A will not debut until 2025 with Panther Lake mobile processors and Clearwater Forest server processors. Lunar Lake shares the same Lion Cove P-core and Skymont E-core architectures with Arrow Lake desktop and mobile processors.\nWith the Lion Cove P-core Intel claims a 14% IPC uplift on average over Redwood Cove. Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) has been removed from Arrow Lake's Lion Cove P-cores. SMT first made its debut in an Intel desktop processor with the Northwood-based Pentium 4 in 2002. Its removal in Lion Cove marks the first time since then that SMT has been completely removed from a new x86-64 Intel performance-oriented core architecture rather than it simply being disabled in some lower-end Celeron and Pentium SKUs. SMT, or Intel's marketing term HyperThreading, allows a single physical CPU core with 2 threads to execute two tasks simultaneously. In the early 2000s, SMT was a way to add more processing threads to dual and quad-core CPUs while not using too much die space. The removal of SMT allows the physical core die area to be reduced. Increasing the number of processing threads with a greater number of physical cores can compensate for the removal of SMT providing 2 threads per core. Intel's removal of SMT yields a 15% saving in die area and 5% greater performance-per-watt. To counteract the removal of SMT, Intel prioritzed executing more instructions per cycle for high single-threaded performance rather than parallel execution. L2 cache per core for Lion Cove is increased to 2.5MB from Redwood Cove's 2MB. Lunar Lake is able to exercise more granular control over Lion Cove's boost clocks. Lion Cove's boost clocks are able to increase in increments of 16.67\u00a0MHz rather than in 100\u00a0MHz increments.\nLunar Lake's cluster of 4 Skymont E-cores exist on a 'Low Power Island' separate from the P-cores. As a result, the E-cores have their own dedicated L3 cache not accessible to the P-cores rather than sitting on a ringbus fabric with P-cores. Intel claims a massive 68% IPC gain in Skymont E-cores over Crestmont. It achieves this with the inclusion of new 8-wide integer ALUs, doubled from Crestmont.\nNeural Processing Unit (NPU)\nLunar Lake's Neural Processing Unit (NPU), which performs AI operations locally, in-silicon rather than in the cloud, has been updated to Intel's \"NPU 4\" architecture with increased clock speeds. Intel claims that Lunar Lake can achieve a total of 120 TOPS of performance in AI workloads, with 48 TOPS coming from the NPU alone while an additional 67 TOPS come from the GPU and 5 TOPS from the CPU. Lunar Lake's 48 dedicated NPU TOPS meets Microsoft's requirements for laptops in order to be certified as Copilot+ PCs. Microsoft has mandated 40 TOPs on NPU performance in order to run Copilot locally on Windows PCs. For comparison, the NPU in Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake processors",

    "Argentinean rabbi and diplomat\nShimon Axel Wahnish is an Argentinean rabbi and diplomat. Since 2024, he has been Argentina's ambassador to Israel. For the major role that Wahnish played in fostering Argentian President Javier Milei's growing affinity and interest in Judaism, Wahnish has been called Milei's rabbi and spiritual advisor, even though Milei is not Jewish.\nEarly life\nWahnish born into a non-religious Moroccan Jewish family. On a trip to Israel when he was 18, he discovered his passion for Judaism and became more religious as a young adult, according to Mishpacha. After high school, Wahnish studied in yeshivas in Israel before returning to Argentina and obtaining a degree in education.\nIn 2012, Wahnish became the chief rabbi of ACILBA, the official group of Argentina's Moroccan Jewish community. Among his responsibilities was to certify Argentinian applicants for Spanish and Portuguese citizenship.\nRelationship with Javier Milei\nThrough his work with ACILBA, Wahnish first encountered Javier Milei, then a National Senator and fringe political figure in Argentina. Milei hoped to speak to ACILBA to counter the perception that he was antisemitic. An initial 15-minute pro forma meeting between Wahnish and Milei on June 28, 2021, turned into 2 hours. The two formed a close friendship, and Wahnish joined Milei's inner circle alongside Milei's sister Karina.\nAmidst Milei's political rise, he remained close with Wahnish, attending the rabbi's classes at the Great Temple of Piedras Street and joining Washnish's family for Jewish holidays and Shabbat dinners. During his presidential campaign, Milei began infusing Jewish elements into his events, including the blowing of the shofar, and he hinted at a desire to convert to Judaism. During Milei's inaugural ceremonies, he held an interfaith service in December 2023 at the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral to include Wahnish.\nWahnish accompanied Milei on his first official visit as president, a three-day trip to Israel in February 2024.\nDiplomatic career\nMilei nominated Wahnish to be Argentina's ambassador to Israel on December 11, 2023.\nDuring his confirmation in the Argentine Senate, Wahnish faced accusations of dual loyalty from National Senator Luc\u00eda Corpacci, whose comments were condemned by the Delegaci\u00f3n de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas (DAIA). On March 27, Argentinian Foreign Minister Diana Mondino convinced National Senator Mart\u00edn Lousteau to sign off on Wahnish's confirmation after Mondino assured the lawmaker that Milei's pledge to move the Argentinian embassy to Jerusalem would not threaten Argentina's claim to the Falkland Islands, moving Wahnish's nomination forward. Wahnish's nomination unanimously passed the Senate on April 18, 2024.\nUpon his confirmation, Wahnish became the first rabbi to serve as an ambassador to Israel. The role of Argentinian ambassador to Israel had been vacant since April 2022 since Sergio Urribarri was convicted of corruption and resigned from the position.\nPersonal\nWahnish is married with six children. His brother Hernan is also a rabbi and succeeded Washnish as leader of ACILBA. Wahnish is fluent in Hebrew.\n",
    "1878 Krupp breech loader naval artillery\nThe 35.5\u00a0cm Mantel Ring Kanone L/25 was a 35.5\u00a0cm 25 caliber long Krupp Mantel Ring Kanone (MRK). It was a rifled breech loader built-up gun with a Krupp cylindroprismatic sliding breech. It was one of the few Krupp breechloaders that was designed to profit from slower burning gunpowders, but not for using very long projectiles. The gun was used by Denmark.\nContext\nUp to the 35.5\u00a0cm MRK L/22.5\nMain article: 35.5 cm MRK L/22.5\nIn the race between naval guns and armor, Krupp developed a series of heavy rifled breech loader built-up guns (Ring Kanone) starting in the mid-1860s. At first, the Prussian Navy thought that a 15\u00a0cm gun would suffice to penetrate armor. This caliber soon proved insufficient, and by 1867 the caliber of the Krupp cannon had increased to 24\u00a0cm, see 24 cm K L/20. This was still not enough, and by 1875, the caliber of the biggest Ring Kanone had increased to 35.5\u00a0cm. The dimensions of this gun and its siblings followed a pattern. In general, they were either short (19 calibers long) or long (22 calibers long), but of comparable construction.\nThe 35.5 cm MRK L/22.5 was the direct ancestor of our 35.5\u00a0cm MRK L/25. It already had the Mantel Ring Kanone (MRK) construction, which meant that it was jacketed and hooped instead of only hooped. This increased the maximum explosive gas pressure that the barrel could withstand by about 25%.\nThe effects of slower burning gunpowder\nWhen the North German Federal Navy accepted the Krupp system of guns in the late 1860s, Krupp guns already depended on using a type of slow-burning gunpowder called prismatic gunpowder. In German Prismatisches Pulver (P.P). This made it possible to use a higher charge without reaching a higher peak gas pressure inside the gun. The first kind of prismatic gunpowder that was adopted for service was the so-called P.P.\u00a0c/68 which had a density of 1.66.\nAlready during the tests of the gunpowders that led to the P.P.\u00a0c/68, it was known that for profiting from prismatic gunpowder the length of the gun was important: The higher the absolute length of the barrel, the more one would profit from the advantages of prismatic gunpowder. When in late 1868, Krupp got the order to design what would become the 21 cm RK L/22 and the 24 cm RK L/22, the requirements included making them longer but of the same weight as the previous shorter models.\nAdvances in gunpowder manufacturing\nBy the winter of 1875/76, when Krupp was developing and testing the Mantel Ring Kanone (MRK) construction, developments in gunpowder science had led to the P.P.\u00a0c/75. This was a gunpowder with a density of 1.75. It burned even slower than the P.P.\u00a0c/68 and was accepted for use in the 26 and 28\u00a0cm guns.\nDevelopment\nProblems with the new gunpowders\nThe discoveries about the properties of different kinds of gunpowder and the project to develop what would become the P.P.\u00a0c/75 led to a lot of experiments. It also proved quite a challenge to actually produce the new kinds of gunpowder in a uniform quality. E.g. even in 1876 a big variation in the density of a batch of P.P.\u00a0c/75 led to dangerously high pressures in the 28\u00a0cm gun.\nAnother problem was that gunpowder that sufficed for one gun did not necessarily work in another gun. A good quality P.P.\u00a0c/75 led to excellent results in the 26 and 28\u00a0cm guns. However, with the heavier 30.5 cm MRK L/22, it led to many problems with dangerously high peak pressures.\nFirst longer guns\nIn light of what Krupp knew about developments in gunpowder, it's logical that it wanted to make longer guns. Longer guns were the way to profit from the advantages that slower burning gunpowder offered.\nOne of the first heavy caliber guns which was significantly longer than the L/19's and L/22's of the original Krupp system was the 17 cm RK L/25, developed in 1874. However, a test of this gun showed that while the P.P.\u00a0c/75 gunpowder did well in many respects, it did not suffice for this 17\u00a0cm gun, because not enough of the charge burned inside the barrel.\nThe 35.5 cm MRK L/25 is revealed\nIn 1878 Krupp presented its latest achievements to a large delegation of national and foreign officers and dignitaries. On 27 June 1878 the guests attended the test-firing of a 15.5\u00a0cm gun that was in an armored emplacement. (The test of this Panzerkanone was a sequence to a November 1877 test.) On 2 and 3 July 1878, the guests then attended a large test-firing at Krupp's new artillery range in Meppen.\nIn Meppen, the new 35.5\u00a0cm MRK L/25 was the centerpiece of the show. Other guns that where tested simultaneously were the 30.5 cm MRK L/25, the 'Dutch' 28 cm A No. 1 gun and a 15\u00a0cm gun.\nOf these guns, the 35.5\u00a0cm MRK L/25, the 30.5 cm MRK L/25, and the 15\u00a0cm MRK L/26 were long guns, called 'lange', the 28\u00a0cm gun was only L/22 long and was called 'kurze'. The three heaviest guns were mounted on a coastal carriage, while the 15\u00a0cm gun was on a ship carriage.\nCharacteristics\nThe barrel and carriage\nThe 35.5\u00a0cm MRK L/25 had a cali",

    "Species of lichen\nMycoblastus sanguinarius, commonly known as the bloody heart lichen, is a widespread species of crustose lichen in the family Tephromelataceae. It is distinguished by its pale to dark grey thallus, which can appear very irregular and uneven, often with a thick, coarse, wart-like texture. The thallus may be continuous or somewhat cracked, with a prothallus that ranges from pale to dark grey. The apothecia (fruiting bodies) are frequent, black, and become convex or hemispherical as they mature. These structures develop on a bright carmine-red thalline cushion, which is revealed when the thallus is damaged or worn. The lichen grows in temperate and montane forests across Asia, Europe, and North America. Usually found on tree bark, it has been recorded less frequently on decorticated wood and moss-covered rocks.\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum. As was the practice at the time, ha classified it in the eponymous genus Lichen. It was shuffled around to various genera in its taxonomic history, including Lecidea, Patellaria, Sphaeria, and Verrucaria, among others. In 1926, Johannes Musaeus Norman transferred it to the genus Mycoblastus. Molecular phylogenetics analyses have revealed that M.\u00a0sanguinarius forms a monophyletic group within the genus Mycoblastus. This species complex includes multiple cryptic clades that are distinguished by their fatty acid profiles rather than morphological differences.\nStudies have shown that M.\u00a0sanguinarius is closely related to several other species within the genus, including the rare M.\u00a0glabrescens. Within the broader M.\u00a0sanguinarius complex, two deeply divergent species can be identified: one corresponds to the southern hemisphere species M.\u00a0sanguinarioides, and the other matches M.\u00a0sanguinarius in the strict sense, which is widely distributed in North America and Asia. These findings indicate that chemical differentiation, particularly in fatty acid composition, often precedes morphological changes and may drive speciation within the complex.\nThe presence of a deep red pigment, rhodocladonic acid, is a key characteristic of M.\u00a0sanguinarius. This pigment is often visible in the tissue below the apothecia and gives the lichen its common name, \"bloody heart lichen\". The taxonomy of M.\u00a0sanguinarius has been further complicated by historical recognition of unpigmented forms, which were sometimes classified as separate species, such as M.\u00a0affinis and M.\u00a0alpinus. Molecular data have now clarified these relationships, supporting the distinction of M.\u00a0sanguinarius from other similar taxa and highlighting the cryptic diversity within this species.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Mycoblastus sanguinarius ranges in colour from pale to dark grey. The thallus is often very irregular, thick, and has a coarse, wart-like (verrucose or papillose-warted) texture, giving it a marbled appearance. It can be continuous or somewhat cracked, and sometimes a pale to dark grey prothallus (the initial growth stage) is present. Soralia (propagules for asexual reproduction) are rare but, when they do appear, they are rounded, scattered, often few in number, and can be the same colour as or paler than the thallus. These soralia are convex and have an efflorescent (powdery) appearance.\nThe apothecia (sexual reproductive structures) are usually frequent and measure between 0.5 and 1.7\u00a0mm in diameter, occasionally up to 3.0\u00a0mm. They are black, becoming convex or hemispherical as they mature, and can be sessile (sitting directly on the thallus) or slightly constricted at the base. These apothecia develop on a bright carmine-red thalline cushion that becomes visible when the thallus is damaged or worn. The asci (spore-producing cells) typically contain 1 to 3 spores. The ascospores themselves are cylindrical with rounded ends, measuring 70\u2013100\u00a0\u00b5m in length and 35\u201345\u00a0\u00b5m in width, with a thick wall of about 6\u20137\u00a0\u00b5m.\nMycoblastus sanguinarius also commonly has pycnidia, which are small asexual reproductive structures. These pycnidia are 40\u201350\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter, with dark green walls, and produce bacilliform (rod-shaped) conidia measuring 6\u20139\u00a0\u00b5m in length and about 1\u00a0\u00b5m in width. The cortex of the thallus reacts to chemical spot tests with C\u2013, K+ (yellow), and Pd+ (yellow), while the medulla reacts K+ (red) in parts and UV\u2013, indicating the presence of chemical compounds such as atranorin, chloratranorin, rhodocladonic acid, and caperatic acid. The soralia do not react to Pd. Underneath the apothecia, the tissue and hypothecium are carmine to blood-red, reacting K+ (bright red), with the pigment diffusing into the solution.\nHabitat and distribution\nMycoblastus sanguinarius grows in a variety of habitats, primarily growing as an epiphyte on tree bark in cool, moist environments. It is found in temperate forests across North America, Europe, and Asia. This lichen is particularly abundant in boreal and montane forests, where it often grow",
    "Municipal building in Redruth, Cornwall, England\nThe Old Courthouse, also known as the Old Town Hall, is a historic building in Penryn Street in Redruth, a town in Cornwall, in England. The structure, which was used for judicial purposes before being converted for use as a social club, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe building was commissioned as a courthouse established to enforce debts under the Small Debts Act 1845. The site the court officials selected was on the west side of Penryn Street. It was designed by Robert Blee in the neoclassical style, built in granite and was completed in 1850. It also served as a public events venue and, in April 1853, the Redruth Band performed a concert there. By the 1870s, the building was being let out for monthly meetings of the County Court, which had exclusive jurisdiction over all small claims throughout west Cornwall.\nIn October 1873, a trial took place at Camborne Town Hall, during which the prosecuting solicitor, Richard Holloway, demanded that the miners, James and Joseph Bawden, be sentenced to five months on the treadmill in Bodmin Jail for their part in the Camborne riots. During the trial, the defendants' supporters threatened to blow up the Redruth Courthouse, which as the small debts courthouse was particularly unpopular with the miners, and pursued the prosecutor down the street. The Redruth Courthouse was also used as a Wesleyan reform meeting room at that time.\nIn 1891, it became the office of the solicitor and archaeologist, Thurstan Collins Peter, who outside his legal activities, carried out excavations at Carn Brea. Peter became clerk of the rural sanitary authority and, after that entity was superseded by Redruth Rural District Council in 1894, he became the clerk of the rural district council with his office in the courthouse.\nAfter the county court was transferred to Camborne in 1977, the building went on to serve as a private members club, originally founded as a gentlemen's club but later expanded to include ladies as well. Monthly meetings of the Redruth and Camborne Branch of the Royal Naval Association continue to be held in the club.\nArchitecture\nThe building is constructed of granite, and has a slate roof.  It is two storeys high and three bays wide.  The central bay features a central recessed porch formed by a pair of Tuscan order columns supporting a frieze with wreaths and a cornice; on the first floor there is a central window flanked by pilasters supporting an entablature and a cornice. The outer bays are fenestrated by sash windows with voussoirs on the ground floor and by sash windows with architraves on the first floor. At roof level there is a frieze with triglyphs and wreaths and projecting eaves supported by a series of mutules. Inside, there is an original staircase leading up to the former courtroom on the first floor. The building was grade II listed in 1978.\n",
    "\nThe 2024 Western Cape provincial election was held on 29 May 2024, concurrently with the 2024 South African general election, to elect the 42 members of the 7th Western Cape Provincial Parliament.\nBackground\nMain article: 2019 Western Cape provincial election\nThe previous provincial election was won by the ruling Democratic Alliance (DA), but with a reduced majority of 55.45%, down from 59.38% in the 2014 election. The party lost two seats and achieved a majority of 24 seats in the legislature.  The Official Opposition African National Congress (ANC) declined from 32.89% to 28.64%, and also lost two seats. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) significantly grew, going from 2.11% to 4.04%, and, consequently, gained one seat. The newly-formed Good received 3.11% of the vote and won a seat. The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) grew to 2.66% and retained its sole seat. The Freedom Front Plus (FF+) and Al Jama-ah also won one seat each.\nIssues\nDevolution of policing\nOver the last term of government, the devolution of policing power has become a key issue between the Western Cape Government and the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele. The Western Cape Government argues that the Minister has the power to devolve policing, but the Minister denies having the power of devolution, saying that \"the centralisation of the SAPS  in line with the Department  constitutional mandate to prevent, combat and investigate crime...\" Section 205 of the Constitution of South Africa sets out policing policy in South Africa, noting that the police service \"must be structured to function in national  provincial...spheres of government.\" The Constitution gives provincial executives the power to monitor police conduct within their respective provinces, as well as the responsibility for policing functions in three cases; namely Chapter 11 of the Constitution, assigned to provincial government in terms of national legislation and allocated to it in national policing policy.\nThe African Growth and Opportunity Act\nThe Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde and a Western Cape Government delegation made a trip to the United States to detail the possible impact that a loss of preferential access to the U.S. market through the African Growth and Opportunity Act would have on the agricultural industry in the province, largely in response to increased U.S. scrutiny over the South African government's increased military co-operation with Russia and China and potential co-operation with Iran. The Leader of the Opposition in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament, Cameron Dugmore (ANC) accused the provincial government of wasting taxpayer's money, saying \"this trip was about the DA\u2019s desperation to secure support for the 2024 elections by creating a certain narrative about this matter\".\nCape independence\nMain article: Cape independence\nThe Freedom Front Plus and the Referendum Party contested the election with Cape independence as part of their platform. The Referendum Party was formed in November 2023 as a single-issue political party aiming to pressure the Western Cape Democratic Alliance government into holding a referendum on Western Cape independence as part of any potential coalition agreement.

    "Australian rules football match\nThe 2004 AFL Cairns Grand Final was an Australian rules football match contested between Port Douglas and North Cairns at Bundaberg Rum Stadium on 18 September 2004. It was held to determine the premiers of the AFL Cairns competition, a semi-professional competition in Cairns, Queensland, for the 2004 season.\nBefore the match began, a brawl began moments after the conclusion of the national anthem. Further fighting occurred on the field and in the crowd during the match.\nNorth Cairns, who were seen as underdogs going into the match, won the match by 48 points. However the premiership was stripped following a lengthy investigation, with no premiers awarded for the 2004 season.\nThe grand final gained national media attention, and is considered one of the ugliest moments in Australian rules football history.\nBackground\nNorth Cairns (nicknamed the \"Tigers\") was a founding member of the AFL Cairns competition (then known as Cairns AFL) in 1956, while Port Douglas (nicknamed the \"Crocs\") had joined in 1989. The clubs were bitter rivals.\nThe coach of North Cairns was Jason Love, a former VFL/AFL player who played 68 games for North Melbourne and Sydney from 1986 until 1992, while Port Douglas was coached by Andy Viola.\nThe previous grand final in 2003 had been won by South Cairns, who defeated North Cairns by 36 points.\nFinals series\nPort Douglas defeated North Cairns by 65 points in the second semi-final, however the Tigers were still able to qualify for the grand final after defeating Cairns in the preliminary final.\nMatch summary\nMoments after the rendition of \"Advance Australia Fair\" was completed, North Cairns players charged at the Port Douglas players. A brawl immediately began, with some club officials and spectators joining in before the match had officially begun.\nThe brawl, which involved all 44 players, eventually ended when umpires ran to the centre of the field and bounced the ball to start the game. Fighting continued on the field throughout the game.\nA junior exhibition match that was scheduled for half-time was cancelled after parents left the stadium with their children. Video broadcast on Nine News showed a North Cairns supporter punching another man in the face as fighting continued.\nSix police units were called to the stadium, with a 36-year-old woman arrested for obstructing police and contravening directions. A police spokesman later said officers were \"too busy breaking up fights\" to make more than one arrest.\nNorth Cairns won the game by 48 points. Medal presentations were not held out of fear for more violence, and Port Douglas players almost fought with spectators as they left the field. Some fighting continued in the crowd following the final siren.\nScoreboard\nAftermath\nImmediate reactions\nThe brawl made national news, including reports on Nine News and Ten News in Brisbane the following night. Port Douglas coach Andy Viola said that \"all week  Jason Love had indicated it was going to be fiery, he was in the radio, in the paper, saying 'watch for the start of the game'\".\nOn 20 September, two days after the match, an investigation was formally launched. The probe was headed by Jim Henry, a former Crown prosecutor and future Supreme Court of Queensland judge.\nA report into the brawl was handed down in October following a short delay. It was the lengthiest investigation in the history of Australian rules football.\nPenalties\nOn 23 December 2004, AFL Cairns handed down suspensions for all 22 North Cairns players. The length of the suspensions ranged from ten matches to five years, and totalled 400 weeks. Only two players pleaded guilty.\nAFL Cairns said the tribunal had targeted only North Cairns players because their actions before the brawl occurred. Love, who was banned from coaching for three years after being found guilty of striking, described the tribunal as \"a witch hunt with a foregone conclusion\".\nOn 24 February 2005, Love was given an eight-year ban from coaching, to be served concurrently with the three-year ban, after being found guilty of \"bringing the game into disrepute\".\nLove attempted to have the ban ended in 2010, but was unsuccessful. It was eventually ended on 15 January 2013 after he appealed to AFL Victoria, having since moved away from Queensland.\nLegacy\nSee also: 1990 OMFL Grand Final\nIn 2015, AFL Queensland called the brawl \"one of the ugliest incidents in  history\". The game has also been compared to the 1990 \"bloodbath\" grand final in the Ovens & Murray Football League.\nThe Cairns Post has described it as \"one of the darkest days in Far North Queensland sport\" and one of the most infamous moments in Cairns sporting history.\n",
    "\nThe following is a list of unproduced Hal Ashby projects in roughly chronological order. During his career, American film director Hal Ashby worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these productions fell into development hell or were cancelled, while others remain unrealized as of his death.\n1950s\nBrave New World\nIn his early days in the industry working as an assistant editor, Ashby discussed with his friend Tom Blackwell the possibilities of turning Aldous Huxley's Brave New World into a film. Ashby decided it wasn't viable, believing the material to be \"way too far ahead of the Zeitgeist\" at the time.\nThe Sound of Silence \nAround 1958, Ashby and Ian Bernard wrote a film script inspired by their activities with the antinuclear group SANE titled The Sound of Silence. Set twenty years after the dropping of the atomic bomb, the story follows a war correspondent obsessed with Hiroshima who begins a personal crusade to prevent further nuclear activity. Ashby and Bernard both thought of Robert Mitchum for the lead role, feeling he would be sympathetic with the film's views. Mitchum was supposedly interested, but nothing came of it.\n1970s\nOwen Butler\nAfter shooting was completed on Harold and Maude, Ashby was setting up to direct a screenplay by Joseph Gillette titled Owen Butler, a satire in which the main protagonist systematically kills a number of high-profile figures and gets away with it. He already pitched the project to Robert Evans and interested Beau Bridges in the lead role, planning to get it made through a short-lived company he and Charles B. Mulvehill had just set up, Dumb Fuck Films.\nHair\nMain article: Hair (film)\nIn April 1972, Ashby was approached by producer Michael Butler to direct the film version of his stage musical Hair. After word got out that Ashby pulled out of directing North Dallas Forty, Butler told him that the offer to direct Hair was still on the table. By July 1974, a deal was set up to make the film at Paramount, with Colin Higgins and Michael D. Haller signed as screenwriter and production designer, respectively. While editing commenced on Shampoo, Ashby decided to go to England with Butler to work on ideas for Hair. However, Ashby eventually withdrew from the project due to ill health and, as Butler suspected, was \"worried sick about the scope of the film project.\" The film was made in 1979 without his participation.\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\nMain article: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)\nSimultaneously as Butler was trying to sign him to direct Hair, Ashby was in talks with Michael Douglas about adapting Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which Ashby would direct, Kesey would write, and Douglas would produce along with Saul Zaentz. After finishing shooting The Last Detail, Ashby returned to the project, and met up with Kesey in February 1973 to work on the script. Douglas and Zaentz wanted the film ready to shoot in July. Ashby began auditioning actors in New York that May, including Danny DeVito, James Woods, F. Murray Abraham, William Devane, Meat Loaf and John Belushi. Ashby wanted Jack Nicholson to play the lead character McMurphy, but both Douglas and Zaentz claimed he asked for too much money. When they continued to express dissatisfaction with Kesey's work, he and Ashby withdrew from the project. \"I worked on that for a whole year or more and they wouldn't cast Jack Nicholson in the part,\" Ashby later said. \"So I took a walk. That's the truth. They made up excuses.\" Ironically, Nicholson was later cast by Ashby's replacement, Milo\u0161 Forman, who also replaced him on Hair.\nThree Cornered Circle\nMain article: The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981 film)\nWhile Kesey was writing the screenplay for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Ashby signed to direct MGM's Three Cornered Circle (alternately titled No Way Out), which was a modern take on James M. Cain's classic novel The Postman Always Rings Twice. Ashby saw potential in the script and immediately started pursuing Jack Nicholson to play the lead. Ashby shot screen tests with Andrew Davis of Nicholson and his then-girlfriend Michelle Phillips (who Ashby wanted to cast alongside him), but MGM balked at the choice. They wanted Raquel Welch to play the female lead and since they never came to agree, Nicholson and Ashby left the project and made The Last Detail together instead. Nicholson later brought the property to director Bob Rafelson in the early 1980s, and the film was produced as the only production under Ashby's NorthStar company banner.\nArigato\nDuring filming of The Last Detail, Peter Sellers, who wanted to work with Ashby, sent him a number of scripts including Arigato, based on Richard Condon's comic novel about a wine heist. Ashby enlisted Terry Southern to help with the script. Later, after One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest fell through, Ashby went to London to discuss Arigato with Sellers as well as Jerzy Kosinski's Bein",
    "\nThe Battle of Dhat Irq (Arabic: \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0630\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0631\u0642) was an armed conflict which took place between the forces of Nebuchadnezzar II and the Hijazi Arab tribes in 599 BCE. It ended with an indecisive victory between both parties. This battle was one of the campaigns of Nebuchadnezzar II during the sixth year of his rule.\nIslamic tradition relates that the biblical prophet Jeremiah was involved during the battle as helping to keep the young Ma'ad ibn Adnan safe from the conflict.\nBackground\nThe Arabs in the Hijaz and areas surrounding it had abandoned monotheism and were slowly adopting polytheism and atheism. This issue was brought to the attention of Baruch ben Neriah, who encouraged Nebuchadnezzar II to carry out an invasion on the Arabs as a punishment for their religious situation. In the Islamic traditions, however, it is believed that the battle occurred because God had sent his wrath down on the Arabs for murdering the prophet Shu'ayb ibn Mahdam ibn Dhi Mahdam al-Haduri, and so Nebuchadnezzar II was sent against them.\nCourse of conflict\nIn 599 BCE, on the sixth year of his rule, Nebuchadnezzar II and his forces marched on to Najd where he fought off the attacks of several Arabs. He proceeded on a journey to the Hijaz, and news of his journey reached the ears of Adnan who was the ruler of the Hijaz at the time. Adnan ordered all the tribes of the Arabs to gather their forces in preparation for the attack. They encountered Nebuchadnezzar II at the place of Dhat Irq in the Hijaz, where a bloody battle ensued.\nAccording to the Islamic traditions, while the fighting was ongoing, the biblical prophet Jeremiah entered the city of Mecca where he took into his care the young Ma'ad ibn Adnan, who was around twelve years at the time and had been sent away by his father for safety.\nAftermath\nSome years after the battle had commenced, Ma'ad ibn Adnan returned to his homeland in the Hijaz after 562 BCE, and succeeded his father in ruling. The cities damaged and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II were rebuilt under his rule. Ma'ad would be honoured by his descendants as well, and he became the revered ancestor of several Arab tribes including the Quraysh.\nHistoricity\nWhile a direct invasion of the Hijaz is not mentioned, some contemporary sources do in fact mention a raid against the restless Arab tribes around 599 BCE, one of them being the Qedarites. There was in fact a ruler of the Qedarites during this time who is not Adnan, but rather a king named Yuwai\u1e6fi\u02bf.\nSee also\nQedarites, an Arabian tribe who ruled a kingdom named after themselves and were raided by Nebuchadnezzar II in 599 BCE\nYawm al-Nakhla, an attempted invasion on the Hijaz by the Himyarite Kingdom in 280 CE\n",

    "Former Italian bank\nThe Banco di Sconto e Sete (lit.\u2009'Discount and Silks Bank') was an Italian credit institution based in Turin, created in 1863 by merger of two previous banks, the Cassa di Sconto di Torino (lit.\u2009'Turin Discount Bank', est. 1853) and Banco Sete (lit.\u2009'Bank of Silks', est. 1857). It failed in the severe Italian banking crisis of the early 1890s, was placed into liquidation in 1892, with its remaining assets and liabilities eventually absorbed into the Societ\u00e0 Bancaria Italiana in 1904.\nOverview\nThe Casse di Sconto were part of a plan outlined by Cavour to complement the role of the money-issuing National Bank of the Sardinian States with specialized discount banks. The Cassa di Sconto of Turin was established on 30 August 1853, with financial support from the National Bank. Its branch in Genoa became an autonomous affiliate in 1856.\nThe Cassa di Sconto di Torino started activity with initial capital of one million lire and seat in Palazzo Pallavicino Mossi in Turin, today via Santa Teresa 11.:\u200a6\u200a It was authorized to discount trade bills, grant advances against deposits and public and private funds. It could also receive sums in current accounts with and without interest and make collections and payments on behalf of third parties. During 1856, two capital increases were approved which brought the capital to 8 million lire; a statutory change in 1857 expanded its scope by allowing it to own shares in commercial enterprises.\nIn 1856-1857, the Banco Sete was established by a group of partners including Pietro Brambilla\u00a0, the Ceriana brothers, Gustavo De Fernex, Vincenzo Denina, Vincenzo Luciano, Giuseppe Dupr\u00e8, Gilberto Dumontel, Giuseppe Fontana, G. Paolo Laclaire, Carlo Ogliani, Agostino Plutino\u00a0, Costantino Soldati, and Felice Genero.:\u200a51\u200a The Banco Sete concentrated on financing the silk industry, made advances against raw and processed silks, and granted financing to twisters and spinners, furthermore it was authorized to hold current accounts and issue bonds.\nOn 20 May 1863, the Cassa di Sconto di Torino, which had survived the turbulence of the years 1859-1862 thanks to prudent management, merged with the Banco Sete to form the Banco di Sconto e Sete with support from French financier James de Rothschild. In 1883, the bank moved from Palazzo Pallavicino Mossi to the nearby Palazzo Lascaris\u00a0, but had to sell the latter in 1887 under financial stress.:\u200a6\u200a\nSee also\nCredito Mobiliare\nBanca Generale\nBanca di Credito Italiano\n",

Nearby, there is the Bat Yam municipal stadium and a bus terminal.\nInitially, the cemetery covered an area of 500 dunams (about 123 acres), and later it was expanded by an additional 300 dunams (about 74 acres). The cemetery also includes a military cemetery.\nHistory\nThe cemetery was established in 1964, after the burial grounds at the Nachalat Yitzhak Cemetery and the Trumpeldor Cemetery began to fill up. The mayor of Bat Yam, David Ben Ari, opposed its establishment as he preferred other uses for the land taken for this purpose. The cemetery was intended to be the main regional cemetery for Tel Aviv, and so it was for 15 years until the opening of the Yarkon Cemetery. It was designed by architect R.M. Meir. The opening ceremony was conducted by the Rabbi of Tel Aviv, Isser Yehuda Unterman, on the 7th of Adar 5724. In the month of Iyar of the same year, the first deceased was buried in the cemetery.\nDespite being within the jurisdiction of Bat Yam, it is often referred to as the \"Holon Cemetery\" because, upon its opening, the only entrance was from the eastern gate, coming from Holon. Only after several years was the northern gate built from the Bat Yam direction, which, with the construction of the Ayalon Highway, became the main gate.\nAs in most large cemeteries in Israel, the South Cemetery has many memorials for communities that perished in the Holocaust, and beneath some of them, there are ashes of the victims.\nApproximately 200,000 deceased are buried in the cemetery, and it is designated by the National Insurance Institute as a \"closed cemetery.\"\nThe cemetery contains a section for bereaved parents, a section for children, and sections for other unique population groups.\n",
    "Labor dispute between the National Football League (NFL) and the NFL Referees Association\nThe 2001 NFL referee lockout was a labor dispute between the National Football League (NFL) and the NFL Referees Association that resulted in the use of replacement officials through Week 1 of the 2001 NFL season. The lockout began in August 2001 after both sides failed to reach consensus on a collective bargaining agreement, which had expired upon the conclusion of the 2000 NFL Season. It was the first time in the history of the league that replacement officials were used for regular season games.  On September 19, 2001, an agreement was reached to end the lockout, which was precipitated by the September 11 attacks that had occurred the previous week and caused the postponement of all week 2 games.\nTimeline\nIn 1994, the NFL Referees Association and the NFL agreed to a collective bargaining agreement lasting through the 2000 season. However, following the expiration of the contract in March 2001, the two sides found themselves far apart in negotiations for a new deal. Several referees wished to boycott all training camps and mandatory league officiating clinics, but union leaders asked for no action to be taken as they sought to negotiate with the league. On August 13, 2001, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue stated that the two sides were far apart in negotiations and placed a 10-day time limit on getting a new contract signed before the league would pivot towards using replacement officials.\nOn August 22, 2001, the NFL began the process of hiring replacement referees by sending out over 100 contractional letters to officials in the Arena Football League, NFL Europe, and college football.\nFollowing a breakdown in negotiations, the NFL officially locked out the officials on August 28 beginning with the last week of preseason games. Following more failed negotiations, it was announced on September 6 that the replacement officials would work the Week 1 games after the union rejected a revised offer from the league.\nOn September 10, 2001, replacement officials were informed that they would be working in Week 2 regardless of if the union and league came to an agreement or not.\nAgreement\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, the NFL cancelled all Week 2 games and rescheduled them to the weekend of January 6 and 7. Afterwards, the negotiations between the parties gained steam, with Bill Carrillo, the executive director of the NFL Referees Association, and Jeff Bergman negotiating directly with Dan Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and NFL council Jeff Pash. On September 17, 2001, the league and union agreed to a new 6-year contract, which would see the officials receive a 50% increase in salary with a 100% increase by year 4. On September 19, 2001, the union ratified the contract by a roughly 2-to-1 vote, officially ending the lockout.\nIssues\nThe primary sources of disagreement between the league and the NFL Referees Association pertained to the salaries, pensions, and severance for the officials. The NFL claimed that under their original proposal to the union, officials would receive a 40% increase in salary in the first year of the new agreement with a 120% increase by 2005, along with an increase in pay for preseason and postseason games. After the lockout was imposed, the league increased their offer to the union by offering a 60% increase in salary immediately with a 100% increase by 2003, but the union chose to reject it, leading the lockout to extend into the regular season. The lead negotiator for the union, agent Tom Condon, stated that the officials simply wished to be paid in line with what officials in the NBA, NHL, and MLB were making, while commissioner Tagliabue claimed that the officials were seeking a pay increase of four to five times what they were currently making as part-time officials, wherein the officials for the other major professional sports leagues work full time.\nReplacement officials\nPrior to the first games played with replacement officials, the league chose not to reveal their identities until shortly before the scheduled kickoff. Many of the replacement officials used had experience officiating either in college football or in other professional leagues such as the Arena Football League and NFL Europe. According to Mike Pereira, then the director of officiating for the NFL, union members sent letters to prospective replacements telling them not to cross the picket line, but the letters had the reverse effect and many college officials chose to cross the picket line to spite the perceived arrogance of the union officials. Replacement officials were guaranteed $2,000 per game for four games, regardless of how many games they ended up working.\nBruce Smith incident\nAfter a Week 1 loss to the San Diego Chargers, Washington Redskins defensive end Bruce Smith complained to reporters about replacement official Jim Sprenger, contending that Sprenger was failing to call obvious cases of holding and c",

    "Australian journalist (1861 - 1937)\nFlorence Baverstock born Louisa Florence Blair (1860 \u2013 8 September 1937) was an Australian journalist. She started writing by helping her father write books. She led the women's section of The Bulletin, The Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Morning Herald. She was chosen to be the inaugural President of the Australian Society of Women Writers.\nLife\nBaverstock was born in 1860 in Melbourne. She had a sister named Lillian. Their parents were both immigrants. Her mother Annie (born Macpherson) was the sister of another politician. Her father David Blair was a journalist, writer and politician in Melbourne. Her father decided to write The History of Australasia and the Cyclopaedia Australasia. While she was in her teens she was helping her father in the construction of these books. They were published in 1878 and 1881. Her father further assisted her career when he became the editor of the newspaper The Age. She submitted articles to that paper\nShe was involved with a periodical that was launched called \"The Bohemian\" in the 1880s. Its contributors were Florence and her sister Lillian and a group of moonlighting writers from The Argus. The editor forbade his writers from working elsewhere and paid them extra for their loyalty. Florence and Lillian became contributors but not employees of the Argus.\nIn 1895 veteran journalist Mary Hannay Foott interviewed Florence about her time on \"The Bohemian\" and about her and her sisters visit to Samoa. Florence had met Robert Louis Stevenson and his family who lived there. She championed him and she noted that he was well regarded by the Samoans who were much afraid of becoming a German colony. She and Lillian used the nom de plume of \"Victorian Girl\" jointly.\nIn 1896 she was employed by The Bulletin to lead their women's section. She was employed by the periodical, as their lead writer \"Sappho Smith\" (Ina Wildman) was ill and she died that year. She used the name \"Cleo\" when writing. A commentator who welcomed her appointment, noted that she was the only woman who had written a leader for The Argus. Her career was interrupted by marriage and three children, but she was employed again on the women's section in 1907. This time it was in Sydney for the Daily Telegraph.\nIn 1918 she retired from the Sydney Morning Herald in 1918 after leading its woman section from 1914. Her place was taken by Jean Williamson who was to also be a leader in writing for Australian women in newspapers.\nIn 1925 the Society of Women Writers was formed and Baverstock was the inaugural President. Her four vice-presidents were Pattie Fotheringhame, Mary Gilmore, Isobel Gullett and Mary Liddell and the aim was to encourage other women writers.\nBaverstock died in the Sydney suburb of Mosman on 8 September 1937. She was buried in a family plot. The Melbourne Press Club includes her in their Hall of Fame.\n",
    "Football club from London, England\nFootball club\nCity Ramblers F.C. was an amateur association football club, notionally based in the City of London, but which played at a number of grounds around Greater London.\nHistory\nCity Ramblers F.C., The Sketch, 3 October 1894\nThe club was formed in 1881, out of a cricket club which had existed the previous decade, originally under the name of The City Cricket Club.\nThrough the 1880s, the club played at a low-key level, as the game outside London turned more professional; the club's most senior appearances were in the London Senior Cup but it did not get past the second round.\nAt the start of the 1890\u201391 season, the club amalgamated with the Old St Paul's club, taking the Ramblers' name but the St Paul's colours.  The club effectively inherited the Old St Paul's place in the FA Cup so entered the qualifying rounds for the first time, and, after its scheduled opponents from the Crystal Palace School of Engineers admitted it had entered by accident and scratched, was humbled 8\u20130 by the Old Carthusians in the second.  \nOne of the earliest matches for the new merged club, at Marlow in September, was acrimonious, the Marlow board resolving never to play the Ramblers again, \"in consequence of the disgraceful behaviour of J. W. Meggs\", who was the brothers of the Ramblers' new club secretary Charles.  Meggs was suspended for 3 months for using \"filthy and disgusting language\".\nFrom 1891, London clubs such as Woolwich Arsenal and Millwall Rovers started to turn professional, and the Ramblers were left behind.  The club did not enter the Cup in 1891\u201392, but in 1892\u201393 gained its first win in the competition, beating Old Cranleighans 5\u20131 in the first round; the professionals of Woolwich Arsenal scored double figures against the Ramblers in the second.  Even at the FA Amateur Cup level the club struggled - it lost 6\u20131 at Tottenham Hotspur in the second round in 1894\u201395.\nThe players did however finish the 1893\u201394 season with an unexpected set of medals; as Smethwick Carriage Works scratched from the final of the Wolverton Charity Cup, the Ramblers stepped up to play a friendly for the benefit of the local charity, and, in gratitude, the charity voted to award the runner-up medals to the Ramblers players.  It was a consolation after the death of Sam Larkin, the club's long-running President, the previous month; Larkin had been one of the leading tenants of the Billingsgate Fish Market.\nThe last season for the club was 1895\u201396, in which it lost 1\u20130 to Maidenhead in the first qualifying round of the FA Cup (despite Maidenhead starting with 9 men because of a train problem), and finished the season losing to Wolverton in the semi-final of the Wolverton Charity Cup - both sides were reduced to 10 men due to sendings-off for foul play.  It had had its best run in the London Senior Cup, reaching the last 16, and losing 4\u20132 at Ealing Association.\nThere was a curious aftermath for the club, as in 1906 a fraudster, purporting to represent the City Ramblers Football Club, sent letters requesting charity for a widow of a deceased player; one of the contributors was Arthur Balfour.  The fraudster - one Alfred Whale of Harringay - was sentenced to 3 months' hard labour.\nColours\nThe club originally played in chocolate and white before adopting the St Paul's school colours of white shirts.\nGround\nThe club had something of a nomadic existence, playing at the following:\n1881\u201384: Victoria Park, Dulwich\n1884\u201390: Spotted Dog, Upton Park\n1890\u201394: Silver Street, Edmonton\n1894\u201395: Hermit Road, Canning Town\n1895\u201396: Ponders End Athletic Ground, adjoining Ponders End railway station.\nNotable players\nCharlie McGahey, more famous as a cricketer, but who played for the Ramblers from 1891 to 1896.\n",
    "1563 siege between Denmark and Sweden\nThe Siege of \u00c4lvsborg (Swedish: Bel\u00e4gringen av \u00c4lvsborg), also known as the Siege of Elfsborg (Danish: Belejringen af Elfsborg), was a siege of the Swedish fortress of \u00c4lfsborg by the Danish army under King Frederick II at the start of the Northern Seven Years' War. The siege ended in a quick Danish victory, and the Swedish commander would surrender the fort before any direct assault would be initiated.\nBackground\nMain article: Northern Seven Years' War\nIn August 1563, the Northern Seven Years' War began. Frederick II of Denmark was stationed in Scania with 28,000 men and began marching up to \u00c4lvsborg Fortress.\n\u00c4lvsborg Fortress was one of Sweden's most important fortifications, and from here you could control shipping from places further inland, like L\u00f6d\u00f6se. Therefore, it was of strategic importance to control the fortress, and if Frederick were to take the castle it would be a big blow to Sweden.\nOn 22 August, the Danish army reached \u00c4lvsborg, made camp, and surrounded the fortress.\nSiege\nOn 22 August, the Danish army made camp at \u00c4lvsborg and surrounded the fortress. The Swedes awaited the attack, yet supplies and reinforcements could not be sent to the besieged Swedes. On 1 September, the Danes were ready and the siege began. Under Erik Kagge, the Swedish garrison stood at 700 men and 32 cannons of various sizes. The garrison was keen on defending the castle from the Danish artillery, and Frederick II describes an incident from the siege:\nIllustration of Daniel Rantzau, by Oskar Alin in 1889. Rantzau would play a prominent role in the Northern Seven Years' War and be promoted to commander-in-chief.\nWe  were in front of the castle with our colonels and men of war; and (just) as we stood outside one rampart, he shot  with half a snake out of the castle us right overhead, not \u00bd cubit, midway between Count von Schwartzburg and Count Johan of Oldenburg, and the rush of the lot flew right over J\u00f8rgen von Holle while he was sleeping, and met one of his generals and broke his arm. Glory be to God who preserved us.\u2014\u200aFrederick II of Denmark\nAfter three days of shooting, the besiegers had made a hole in the fortification, and thereby the fortress could be assaulted. Commander, Daniel Rantzau, got the task of assaulting the fortification, however before he would do that, Erik Kagge had already surrendered.\nAftermath\nAfter this, the Danes took much booty, including the 32 cannons in the fortress and two warships which would be incorporated into the Danish fleet. Frederick II installed J\u00f8rgen Rantzau as commander of the conquered fortress, with a garrison of four companies, later reduced to two. The Danish army would later march south to Halland where it would confront Eric XIV's army.\nSee also\nBattle of Marstrand\u00a0\u2013 1677 battle of the Scanian War\nBattle of Mared\u00a0\u2013 1563 Swedish-Danish battle\nGothenburg\u00a0\u2013 City in V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, Sweden\nEstonian campaign (1563)\u00a0\u2013 Swedish invasion of Danish Estonia in 1563\n",

There is some suspicion that Eshtewi died in custody and was shot after death, from reports of people who saw his body before burial and thought the bullet wounds looked suspicious.

    "\nThe AITEX Textile Technological Institute is a technological center headquartered in Spain dedicated to research in the fields of science and technology that have applications in the textile industry.\nDetails\nIt is a private non-profit association, made up of textile and related companies, with the main objective of improving the competitiveness of the sector and offering society textile-based solutions that contribute to improved well-being, health, and quality of life for people. The commonly used name is AITEX as it is the Spanish language acronym for \"Textile Industry Research Association\". It was established in 1985 at the initiative of the Valencian government, through the Institute of Small and Medium Industry of the Valencian Government (IMPIVA). Its founding President was Ricardo Cardona Salvador, who served until 1992. Rafael Terol Aznar was Honorary \"Conseller\" from 1992 to 2009. The headquarters are located in Alcoy, a city in Alicante with an industrial and textile tradition, but it also has two Technical Units. One is located in the Valencia Technology Park, and the other in Ontinyent, from where support is offered to each of these industrial areas. On an international level, it also has delegations in China, India, and Pakistan.\nThe institute works in various areas of knowledge, including intelligent and functional textiles, textile comfort, biotechnology applications in textile processes, nanotechnology applied to the development of textile materials, new textile processes, and textile solutions for areas such as health, personal protection, and security.\nAITEX has published a publication called AITEX Review since 2000, a four-monthly publication that collects innovations and the technical and scientific news that is applied in the textile sector.\nIn 2005, AITEX created the Made in Green label, a certification that guarantees that products do not have harmful substances for health and that from its perspective the environment and the universal rights of workers have been respected.\n",
    "Genus of planthoppers\nLevu is a genus of small planthoppers from the family Derbidae, tribe Rhotanini, with more than 30 species. The species are found mainly on the islands of the western Pacific, particularly Melanesia. A few species have been also reported from eastern Australia and mainland Asia. The adult hoppers are around 4\u20135 mm long from head to the tip of the forewings. They lack the bright colours or conspicuous wing patters of other derbids, but a few species have red or orange markings. The wings may be carried in a roof-like (tectiform) position when the insects are at rest or they form a common plane like in house flies.\nType species: Levu vitiensis Kirkaldy, 1906\nDistribution\nDistribution ranges of the species in the genus Levu (blue outline) and that of the type species, Levu vitiensis (brown outline)\nMost of the species of Levu have been reported from the islands of the western Pacific, especially from Melanesia, including New Guinea (7 species), the Solomon Islands (7 species), Vanuatu (4 species), Fiji (2 species) and New Caledonia (1 species). Levu species are also found in Polynesia (3 species), Micronesia (5 species) and the Philippines (6 species). Further, one or two species each have been recorded in Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan and mainland Asia. The type species Levu vitiensis has an unusually wide distribution compared to other species of Levu, ranging from Fiji in the East to Australia in the West, as far south as New South Wales, and including parts of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia.\nDescription\nForewing venation of Levu samoensis\nThe species of Levu have a similar forewing venation compared to the sister genus Rhotana. In general however, the forewings are narrower, especially the basal median cell. The species are smaller than those of Rhotana, although the smallest species of Rhotana are of similar size compared to the largest species of Levu. The forewings of Levu are less transparent and are often lightly powdered. The forewings have few conspicuous markings and lack the colour pattern often found in Rhotana, but some species have dark brown forewings (L. rufulus, L. nocturnus). The hind wings always lack any markings. When the insects are at rest, the wings may be carried in a roof-like (tectiform) position (see the taxobox above) or form a common plane like in house flies. While most Levu species have a uniformly straw-coloured body, some species have red or orange marks on the head, for example around the eyes or along the face (frons) like in Levu knighti. The forewings venation of Levu samoensis is unusual in that the 2 sub-branches of the first branch of the media curve towards each other and touch each other briefly around half way before reaching the wing margin (arrow in illustration at left). This venation is found in 7 species which have been grouped into the \"Levu samoensis species group\".\nBiology\nThere is almost no information on the biology of the species of Levu. It is assumed that the nymphal stages live in decaying organic matter like other derbids, feeding on fungi. There is also little information on the host plants the adults feed on. Some species have been collected from palms like many other derbids (e.g. Levu apiatus), others seem to be polyphagous like Levu vitiensis which has been reported on palms (Araceae), but also on Pipturus, Flagellaria and Acalypha plants.\nTaxonomy and species\nThe genus Levu and the type species Levu vitiensis have been named after the Fijian island Viti Levu, the locality of the type. Actually, in Fijian, \"levu\" means big (Viti Levu = big land), a grand name for a group of tiny insects. A total of 34 species of Levu have been described (as of 2024), most of them restricted to a few islands. The most frequently collected species include:\nLevu apiatus (New Guinea)\nLevu erraticus (New Guinea, Vanuatu)\nLevu knighti (Solomon Islands)\nLevu rubropleuralis (Philippines)\nLevu samoensis (Samoa)\nLevu vitiensis (many parts of Melanesia and eastern Australia)\nLevu vitiensis Kirkaldy, 1906\nPatterns on head and forewing of Levu vitiensis, of specimens from Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands\nThe type species Levu vitiensis is unusual, not only because of its wide distribution range but also because of its variation in colour patterns. As illustrated on the left, the markings on the head can vary from none to one or two orange, orange-brown or red marks in front of the eyes. The background colour of the head and mesonotum can vary from straw-coloured to distinctly brown. While there are always 2 dark brown or black marks near the forewing tip, the remaining colouration of the forewing can vary considerably, from nearly white veins and a little light brown around some of them, to most veins being brownish or orange brown and accompanied by brown areas. There is a continuous range among these colour forms, even on the same island and an absence of other characters which could separate these forms.\n",
    "Austrian poet (1891\u20131963)\nHildegard Jone (1 June 1891 \u2013 28 August 1963) was an Austrian poet and artist. As a poet she produced poetry collections and books throughout her life. She was also a painter and sculptor, with works infused with Expressionism and Christian imagery.\nMany of her lyric poems were set to music by her colleague Anton Webern.\nLife and career\nHildegard Jone was born Hildegard Huber on 1 June 1891 in Sarajevo of Austria-Hungary. Her parents were the architect Ludwig Huber and Am\u00e9lie (n\u00e9e the Countess Deym), both of whom encouraged her early interest in the arts. In 1908 Jone and her mother moved to Vienna so the former could attend the Wiener Frauenakademie\u00a0, a women's art academy. At the Frauenakademie, her instructor was the sculptor Josef Humplik; the two would later marry in 1921.\nAs a visual artist, Jone created paintings and sculptures throughout her life. Her work was often Expressionist and infused with Christian imagery or inspiration. Jone was well aquatinted with many other artists and writers of her time, including Peter Altenberg, Adolf Loos, Ludwig von Ficker\u00a0 and Karl Kraus, who became a spiritual mentor.\nJone is well known for her collaborations with the composer Anton Webern, who set her music numerous times. Webern's compositions on poems by Jone include the song cycles Drei Ges\u00e4nge aus 'Viae inviae' (1934), Drei Lieder (1934), the orchestral-choral work Das Augenlicht (\"The Eyes' Radiance\") and both his first (1939) and second (1943) cantatas.\nJone died on 28 August 1963 in Purkersdorf, near Vienna. Purkersdorf's local museum includes a room dedicated to Jone and her husband.\nWritings\nall in German\nJone, Hildegard (1918). \"Ring, Mein Bewu\u00dftsein!\" . Verlag des Ver. No.\u00a014/15.

    "Television station in Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil\nTV Vit\u00f3ria is a Brazilian television station based in Vit\u00f3ria, capital of the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. It operates on channel 6 (UHF digital 38) and is affiliated to Record. It is owned by Rede Vit\u00f3ria de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, a subsidiary of the Buaiz Group, also responsible for the radio stations Jovem Pan FM Vit\u00f3ria and Jovem Pan News Vit\u00f3ria. The broadcaster maintains studios at the Buaiz Group headquarters in Parque Moscoso, in addition to commercial offices in Praia do Canto, and its transmitters are at the top of Morro da Fonte Grande.\nHistory\nTV Vit\u00f3ria was the first television station in Esp\u00edrito Santo, being opened on September 8, 1961, on the 410th anniversary of the capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Vit\u00f3ria, by Di\u00e1rios Associados. Initially, it produced local programs and retransmitted attractions produced by TV Tupi S\u00e3o Paulo, the embryo of Rede Tupi, which emerged in the following decade. The station was opened without a concession to operate, and its status was only regularized in June 1979, under the administration of communications minister Haroldo Corr\u00eaa de Mattos.\nWith the end of Rede Tupi in 1980, TV Vit\u00f3ria was one of the Associated broadcasters that was freed from revocation. After a period of independent programming and the retransmission of programs produced by TVS Rio de Janeiro and Record, TV Vit\u00f3ria became, in 1981, one of the first affiliates of SBT. In 1984, Di\u00e1rios Associados sold the station and R\u00e1dio Vit\u00f3ria to the Buaiz Group, after businessman Jo\u00e3o Calmon bought the shares from the other shareholders and resold the station to Am\u00e9rico Buaiz Filho. In the same year, the broadcaster became affiliated to Rede Manchete.\nIn 1992, the broadcaster launched Rede Vit\u00f3ria de Not\u00edcias, which consisted of a partnership with newspapers in the interior of the state to disseminate articles that were broadcast over the telephone by a reporter from the local newspaper during the broadcast of the news, and in return, the TV broadcast the name of the newspapers in the credits. This partnership lasted for two years, because newspaper owners started asking for money and the company was not willing to pay. On October 1, 1998, after two and a half years of negotiations and the decline of Rede Manchete, TV Vit\u00f3ria became affiliated to Rede Record, which was expanding across the country.\nTechnical information\nBased on the federal decree transitioning Brazilian TV stations from analogue to digital signals, TV Vit\u00f3ria, as well as other stations in Vit\u00f3ria, ceased broadcasting on channel 06 VHF on October 25, 2017, following the official schedule of the ANATEL. The switch-off happened at 11:59 pm, during the airing of the Gugu program.\nProgramming\nAs well as relaying Record's national programming, TV Vit\u00f3ria produces and airs the following programss:\nES No Ar: news, with Eduardo Santos;\nBalan\u00e7o Geral ES: news, with Michel Bermudes;\nFala Esp\u00edrito Santo: variety, with Roberta Salgueiro;\nCidade Alerta ES: police news, with Fernando Fully;\nJornal da TV Vit\u00f3ria: news, com Juliana Lyra;\nBalan\u00e7o Geral ES Edi\u00e7\u00e3o de S\u00e1bado: news, with Amaro Neto;\nMundo Business: news, with Ricardo Frizera;\nAgro Business: agricultural news, with Stefany Sampaio;\nMais Doce: culinary competition, with Alessandro Eller;\nChef de Fam\u00edlia: culinary competition, with Alessandro Eller;\nEspirito Startups: program about startups;\nMega Vendedor: reality format.\n",
    "American fire chief and convicted drug dealer\nJoseph \"Bum\" Farto (born July 3, 1919) was a fire chief and convicted drug dealer in Key West, Florida who disappeared in 1976.\nEarly life\nFarto's father was a restaurant owner who came to Key West from Spain via Cuba in 1902. He was the youngest of three children, growing up in a house behind Key West's Fire Station No. 1. He was nicknamed Bum because as a child he would frequently hang around the fire station in Key West. When his father died he quit school to go to work. Farto worked for the WPA's National Youth Administration and became a fireman in 1942. He married his wife Esther Beiro in 1955.\nCareer\nFarto worked his way up at the fire station from lieutenant to captain and finally to Fire Chief in 1964. He was known for his ostentatious behavior, driving a bright green car with El Jeffe written on its side, smoking big cigars, and wearing red suits and rose-tinted glasses. He was reported to practice voodoo and wore a gold double-headed fire axe pinned to his tie. He drove a \"key lime-yellow Ford Galaxy 500 LTD with mirrored tint  chrome hubcaps...\" He received a thirty-day suspension from his position in 1968 by Key West's Civil Service Board for illegal check cashing. His nephew was serving on the board and some felt that Farto not receiving criminal charges was the result of favoritism.\nArrest and conviction\nFarto was arrested and charged with selling cocaine and marijuana to an undercover officer in a sting operation called Operation Conch, a six-month investigation undertaken by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Florida Department of Criminal Law Enforcement and the Dade County Organized Crime Bureau. Twenty-eight other drug dealers were arrested. He was convicted in thirty minutes in early February, 1976.\nDisappearance\nFarto disappeared on February 16, 1976, while he was awaiting sentencing after being convicted of drug trafficking, facing a prison sentence of up to 31 years. He jumped bail and drove a rental car from Key West to Miami where he disappeared. After his disappearance, his name appeared on t-shirts asking \"Where is Bum Farto?\" with companion t-shirts stating \"The Answer is Bum's Away.\" He was declared legally dead in 1986 so that his wife could collect his pension.\nLegacy\nFarto's life story was the subject of a seven-episode podcast, The Bum Farto Story, in 2020 and a musical by Pamela Stephenson called Bum Farto \u2013 The Musical in 2021.\n"
