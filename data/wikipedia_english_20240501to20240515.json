    "Brazilian award\nThe APCA Television Award (Portuguese: Pr\u00eamio APCA de Televis\u00e3o) is one of the areas covered by the APCA Award, a traditional Brazilian award created in 1956 by the S\u00e3o Paulo Association of Theater Critics (now the S\u00e3o Paulo Association of Art Critics). Television became part of the APCA Awards in 1972. Until then, it only awarded theater and classical music. In the same year, film, literature and popular music were also recognized. New areas were incorporated into the competition over the following years.\nThe winners of the APCA Award are chosen between the end of November and the beginning of December during a meeting of APCA member critics. Some categories may include a six-monthly pre-selection of finalists according to demand. Each critic votes exclusively within their area of expertise, selecting a maximum of seven categories in each area, which may change each year according to the critics' perception of the most pertinent in each period. There is also a requirement that a minimum of three critics from each area be present at the vote, which can mean that certain categories are not awarded in some years due to a lack of quorum. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the winners of the 65th edition of the APCA Awards were determined in January 2021. Each area had fewer categories than in previous years. The television area had six categories instead of seven, while in most areas the reduction was to three categories.\nMain categories\nAPCA Award for Best Telenovela;\nAPCA Award for Best Television Actress;\nAPCA Award for Best Television Actor;\nAPCA Award for Best Breakthrough Actor;\nAPCA Award for Best Breakthrough Actress;\nAPCA Award for Best Supporting Actor;\nAPCA Award for Best Supporting Actress.\nWinners by Year\n1970s\n1972\n1973\n1974\n1975\n1976\n1977\n1978\n1979\n1980s\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990s\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000s\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010s\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\nVoting: B\u00e1rbara Sacchitiello, Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Fl\u00e1vio Ricco, Jos\u00e9 Armando Vanucci, Le\u00e3o Lobo, Neuber Fischer and Nilson Xavier.\n2016\nVoting: B\u00e1rbara Sacchitiello, Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente, F\u00e1bio Maksymczuk, Fl\u00e1vio Ricco, Jos\u00e9 Armando Vanucci, Neuber Fischer, Le\u00e3o Lobo, Nilson Xavier and Paulo Gustavo Pereira.\n2017\nVoting: Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Fl\u00e1vio Ricco, Jos\u00e9 Armando Vanucci, Le\u00e3o Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Nilson Xavier and Paulo Gustavo.\n2018\nVoting: Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Fl\u00e1vio Ricco, Le\u00e3o Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Nilson Xavier and Paulo Gustavo Pereira.\n2019\nVoting: Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Fl\u00e1vio Ricco, Le\u00e3o Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Nilson Xavier and Tony Goes.\n2020s\n2020\nVoting: Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Le\u00e3o Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Paulo Gustavo Pereira and Tony Goes.\n2021\nVoting: Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Le\u00e3o Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Paulo Gustavo Pereira and Tony Goes.\n2022\nVoting: Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente (except for the Best Documentary Series category), Fabio Maksymczuk, Le\u00e3o Lobo and Tony Goes.\n2023\nVoting: Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Jos\u00e9 Armando Vannucci, Le\u00e3o Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Paulo Gustavo Pereira and Tony Goes.\nSee also\nMelhores do Ano Trof\u00e9u Doming\u00e3o\nMeus Pr\u00eamios Nick\nTrof\u00e9u Imprensa\n",
    "NCAA Division I ice hockey conference\nAtlantic Hockey America (AHA) is a college ice hockey conference which operates primarily in the northeastern United States. It participates in NCAA Division I as an ice hockey-only conference. The  conference was formed by the merger of the men-only Atlantic Hockey Association and the women-only College Hockey America (CHA).\nHistory\nIn 2010, the men's division of CHA collapsed and two of the remaining teams joined the Atlantic Hockey Association. At that time, the two leagues began working together by sharing a commissioner and administrative staff in order to streamline their operating costs. The arrangement worked well enough that by 2023, the two entities decided to formalize their relationship and announced that they were merging. The new league would begin in the 2024\u201325 season and would welcome a new member, Delaware, the following year.\nMembership\nThree schools, Mercyhurst, RIT and Robert Morris, have programs in both the men's and women's divisions. Holy Cross, Lindenwood, Penn State and Sacred Heart each operate teams of both sexes, but only one is a member of AHA. Niagara and Syracuse only have one varsity program active as of 2024 but both previously supported the other gender.\nCurrent\nConference affiliations are current for the first season of the merged AHA in 2024\u201325.\n^ The Academy grounds lie almost entirely outside the Colorado Springs city limits. The U.S. Postal Service and U.S. Census Bureau respectively treat the Academy as \"USAF Academy\" and \"Air Force Academy\".\n^ Mailing address is \"Niagara University\".\n^ The entire Penn State campus is designated by the U.S. Postal Service as \"University Park\". It straddles the boundary between State College and College Township.\n^ Mailing address is Rochester.\nFuture\nPrimary conference affiliation is current for the first season of AHA play.\n^ As of the date of joining AHA.\n^ Delaware is legally chartered as a \"privately governed, state-assisted\" institution. This status is broadly similar to that of New York's statutory colleges, mostly housed at Cornell University, or institutions in Pennsylvania's Commonwealth System of Higher Education.\nTimeline\nAmerican InternationalArmyBentleyCanisiusHoly CrossMercyhurstNiagaraPenn StateRITRobert MorrisSacred HeartSyracuseDelawareclass=notpageimage| Location of teams in the Northeast full future\n\u00a0\u00a0Men\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Women\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Both\u00a0\u00a0\nChampions\nConference arenas\nAwards\nSee also\nAtlantic Hockey\nCollege Hockey America\nMAAC Awards\n",
    "Human settlement in the Region of Murcia, Spain\nSettlement in Region of Murcia, Spain\nPortm\u00e1n is a locality of the Region of Murcia located to the south of the municipality of La Uni\u00f3n at the foot of the mining mountain range of Cartagena-La Uni\u00f3n in a bay bathed by the Mediterranean Sea.\nIts territory has a very rugged topography, surrounded by mountains that surround the coastal plain, where the population center is located. To the north is the Sancti Spiritu hill, 434 meters high, which is the highest point of the entity, with Fortuna hill further south and the Cabezo de las Lajas, 283 meters above sea level. To the west are located the cabezo of El Pino (271 m above sea level) and the cabezo of La Galera (177 m above sea level), whose slopes plunge towards the Mediterranean Sea; to the east are the Pe\u00f1a del \u00c1guila (387 m above sea level) and the Monte de las Cenizas (307 m above sea level), integrated in the regional park of Calblanque, Monte de las Cenizas and Pe\u00f1a del \u00c1guila. About 3 kilometers from the town, on a promontory to the east of the Portm\u00e1n inlet, stands the lighthouse of the same name.\nToponymy\nIt was founded by the Romans in the first century, with the name of Portus Magnus (Large Port), origin of its current toponymy.\nIn Arab times it was called Burtuman Al-Kabir (Burtuman the Great).\nLater, in the 14th century, in the hunting book of Alfonso XI of Castile it appears as Porte Mayn.\"In the land of Cartagena there are these mountains (...) The Sierra de Porte Mayn is a good pork mountain in winter, and in these mountains there are these springs, the Fuente del Ca\u00f1averal, the Fuente del Porte Mayn. The mountain of Cabo de Palos is a very good mountain for pork in winter, and this mountain is near the sea. And near this mountain is an island, which enters the sea: and it is well over a league long, and there are many deer on it\".\nBook of the hunting of Alfonso XI of Castile. 14th century.The first reference to the current name appears in a book of Cabildos of the City Council of Cartagena in 1590.\nIt shares the origin of its etymology with the municipality of San Antonio Abad (in Catalan: Sant Antoni de Portmany) on the island of Ibiza.\nPortm\u00e1n Bay, clogged by mining waste.\nHistory\nIts location, as a natural port near the mines of Cartagena and La Uni\u00f3n, made it a strategic enclave in Roman times. There are numerous remains of Roman mining and industrial facilities for smelting ore throughout the area.\nWith the new mining boom in the mid-19th century began a new period of great splendor until the mid-20th century.\nIn 1860 it separated from the municipality of Cartagena to become part of what would later become the municipality of La Uni\u00f3n.\nThere are numerous events and celebrations that this district celebrates throughout the year and among them highlights the festival in honor of its patron saint James the Great on July 25, not forgetting the traditional procession of the Virgen del Carmen on July 16, Carnival, Easter and the Portman Theatre Festival which has two editions (December and June), organized by the company PortmanTeatro, which receives in each edition numerous theatrical successes both in the Region of Murcia and other companies in the rest of Spain.\nFor many years, Portm\u00e1n's economy was based on mining, fishing and tourism. Nowadays the inhabitants of Portm\u00e1n find employment opportunities in culture and ecotourism.\nOn August 18, 2011, a serious fire originated in the residential complex La Manga Golf spread rapidly towards the Regional Park of Calblanque, Monte de las Cenizas and Pe\u00f1a del \u00c1guila. Arson was suspected.\nBeaches\nPortm\u00e1n has two main beaches, Playa de San Bruno (the pedestrian beach of the bay) and Playa del Lastre. Next to the Playa de El Gorguel, in the direction of La Uni\u00f3n, is the Playa or Cala de Cola de Caballo.\nClimatology\nThe summers are very hot (the average in July and August is 37-38\u00a0\u00b0C), and in winter the minimum temperature does not drop below 8\u00a0\u00b0C. The annual average is 16-18\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe annual maximum pressure is 970.5 hPa and the minimum 941.2. It rains the most in autumn, less in winter and spring. The average annual rainfall is only 323 mm, although the mist and marine humidity help the existing vegetation a lot.\nWinds usually blow from the southwest (dry libeccio) and in autumn from the east or northeast (levant), which brings clouds and rain. In autumn there is also sometimes a libeccio or northwesterly wind, which clears the sky of clouds.\nIn summer, the strong winds send a certain coolness to the mountains, and when it blows from the south, coming from Africa, the heat lashes the area.\nArchaeological and architectural heritage\nThe intense exploitation of the Sierra Minera de Cartagena since Roman times has left numerous archaeological remains throughout the area.\nThe great Roman Villa of Paturro was discovered in the vicinity of the town, between the boundaries of the municipalities of Cartagena and La Union and was linked to the mining operations ",
    "2020 single by PnB Rock featuring Pop Smoke\n\"Ordinary\" is a song by American rapper PnB Rock featuring American rapper Pop Smoke.\nBackground and release\nAmerican rapper PnB Rock released his sophomore album TrapStar Turnt PopStar in 2019, with it hitting number four on the US Billboard 200. In January 2020, PnB Rock became involved in a street race in Burbank, California, and crashed his car into other parked vehicles, injuring two people in the process. He was arrested for driving under the influence and reckless driving. American rapper Pop Smoke released his sophomore mixtape Meet the Woo 2 on February 7, 2020. Less than a week later, he released a deluxe version of the mixtape featuring new songs and remixes, including \"Like Me\" featuring PnB Rock. PnB Rock released \"Ordinary\" on February 12, 2020, featuring Pop Smoke. It was PnB Rock's first release since \"Fundi\" with Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz in 2019. Just days after the track was released, on February 19, 2020, Pop Smoke was shot and killed at the age of 20 during a home invasion.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\"Ordinary\" is a drill song. The staff of BrooklynVegan mentioned \"Ordinary\" went in a \"darker, harder direction\", compared to PnB Rocks other music. Patrick Johnson of Hypebeast stated the song featured Pop Smoke's \"signature raspy delivery\" over an \"ominous and hard-hitting beat\". \"Ordinary\" begins with Pop Smoke saying \"woo\" numerous times and rapping in the first half of the song, with PnB Rock then rapping for the rest of the song. Lyrically, PnB Rock and Pop Smoke rap about different luxury brands they own in the chorus and during their respective verses.\nPerformances and critical reception\nPnB Rock performed \"Ordinary\" live in Philadelphia on February 16, 2020. The staff of WQHT said the track is \"fire\", with Trace William Cowen for Complex saying the song \"pairs nicely\" with \"Like Me\". Alex Zidel of HotNewHipHop called it \"boisterous\", mentioning that both rappers were \"proving to be quite the formidable duo\". Writing for Revolt, Jon Powell described \"Ordinary\" as a \"hard-hitting release\" and \"infectious\", saying PnB Rock and Pop Smoke had \"obvious chemistry\" and that they needed to collaborate on more music.\n",
    "\nAmerican trial attorney\nKristina Archena Baehr (n\u00e9e\u00a0Scurry, born 1980 or 1981) is an American trial attorney who specializes in bringing class actions on behalf of people who allege they were poisoned by environmental toxins. She has brought several lawsuits representing victims of the Red Hill water crisis at Joint Base Pearl Harbor\u2013Hickam on Oahu.\nEarly life, education and career\nKristina Scurry was born to Pamela M. Scurry and Richardson G. Scurry Jr.; her father worked for an investment firm in Purchase, New York, and co-founded the Bible Literacy Project. She graduated from Princeton University and Yale Law School. At Yale, she authored a law review comment that examined the effect of mandatory minimum sentencing of sex crimes in South African criminal law. She argued that the existing structure favored judicial consideration of mitigating factors and should be replaced with a framework centered on aggravators. In 2007, she married fellow Princeton alumnus Evan Baehr.\nBaehr began her career with the Carter Center helping the Liberian Ministry of Justice launch a sex crimes prosecution unit. She was then a clerk for federal district judge Nancy Gertner. The Baehrs moved to Austin, Texas, where they had four children and where Kristina joined McKool Smith as a corporate litigator.\nBaehr believes that she and her children were being harmed by indoor \"toxic mold\", which is considered a myth by experts. The Baehrs said they spent $700,000 on home mold remediation.\nIn 2021, the Baehrs, represented by counsel, sued 11 builders and contractors involved in their home's construction. All but one defendant settled prior to trial. In August 2023, a Travis County jury proportionally awarded $3.1 million to the Baehrs from the remaining defendant, an HVAC contractor.\nEnvironmental law career\nAfter finding that few Texas attorneys specialized in environmental toxic torts, Baehr in 2021 founded a boutique law firm called Just Well Law to focus on this area of practice.\nRed Hill water crisis\nMain article: Red Hill water crisis\nAfter CNBC featured her in a 2021 segment, Baehr said that she received many calls, including from Hawaii, where military families at Joint Base Pearl Harbor\u2013Hickam claimed serious harms from tap water contaminated by a jet fuel leak. In 2022, Just Well Law and local counsel filed suit in federal court on behalf of military families and civilians who claimed harm from the leak. The number of claimants grew over the next year, reaching 7,500 represented by Just Well Law in three separate cases. The suits were filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\nSome of the plaintiffs against the Navy in the Red Hill litigation are active-duty service members. Although the Feres doctrine bars most tort claims by active-duty personnel, Baehr has argued that it cannot be used to bar claims by service members for injuries they suffered off duty in their own homes.\nA bellwether trial for a limited number of plaintiffs began on April 29, 2024. Media outlets have described Baehr as \"lead counsel\" for the plaintiffs. The U.S. government admitted to liability for negligence at the fuel storage facility and that residents using the water line suffered injury. Baehr described the government's stipulation to liability as \"historic\". The trial is set to determine the extent of harm experienced by plaintiffs and whether the government failed to warn residents of the military base.\n",
    "Notable Gadigal interpreter and sailor\nPortrait of Nanbaree by Thomas Watling\nNanbaree (c.1782 \u2013 12 August 1821), also named Nanbarry and Andrew Snape Hamond Douglass White, was an Aboriginal Australian of the Gadigal clan who undertook a prominent role in establishing communication between the Aboriginal people and the colonists during the early stages of British occupation of the Sydney area. While still a child, he was the first Aboriginal Australian to acquire a functional level of English and became an important interpreter as he had very close kinship ties with prominent figures such as Bennelong and Colebe. During adulthood, he became a notable sailor, voyaging with Matthew Flinders.\nEarly life\nNanbaree was born around 1782 into the Gadigal clan of the Dharug people who spoke the Eora language in what is now the Sydney region.\nArrival of the British and smallpox\nIn 1788, Nanbaree witnessed the arrival of Arthur Phillip in Sydney Harbour with the First Fleet to establish a penal colony consisting of British military personnel and transported convicts.\nIn April 1789, a major smallpox epidemic broke out amongst the Dharug people living around the harbour, killing approximately half of the population. Phillip with the colony's surgeon, John White and a captured Dharug man named Arabanoo, went to look for survivors. They found a boy around 7 years of age and his father lying sick on a beach covered in smallpox lesions. Nearby were the dead bodies of the boy's mother and baby sister. The boy and his father were taken back to the British settlement where they were cared for by White and Arabanoo in a hut next to the field hospital. The boy's name was Nanbaree. His father soon died, as did Arabanoo, but Nanbaree recovered and was taken to live with White and his servant.\nLiving with the British\nWhite helped teach Nanbaree English and gave Nanbaree the British name of Andrew Snape Hamond Douglass White, after Sir Andrew Hamond, who he had served under previous to being assigned to the First Fleet. Soon after Nanbaree's arrival at the British settlement, another young smallpox survivor, a twelve-year-old girl named Boorong, was brought in. She was taken into the household of the colony's chaplain Richard Johnson and developed a close friendship with Nanbaree. A couple of months later they were further joined by Nanbaree's uncle Colebe and by Bennelong, who were both forcibly abducted by the British, but they managed to escape after several months. Nanbaree also tried to escape when he was taken by boat to be shown to his surviving relatives, but was restrained from swimming to them.\nInterpreter for the colonists\nBy 1790, Nanbaree had become accustomed to living with the British and became quite good at speaking English. He was utilised as an interpreter by the colonists to communicate with his kinspeople. Despite his young age, he acted as an important interlocutor when a group of officers encountered Bennelong and Colebe at Manly, a situation that later developed into the incident where Phillip was speared and wounded by the warrior Willemering. Despite this violence, further interactions between Bennelong and the British, translated by Nanbaree and Boorong, saw a thawing of relations resulting in more Aboriginal people visiting the British settlement.\nNanbaree's language skills and position within the colony also became useful in warning his people about military operations that were planned against them. On one occasion he informed Ballooderry that soldiers were coming to shoot him and on another he told Colebe that a punitive expedition had been ordered by the governor against the warrior Pemulwuy.\nWhite's household\nNanbaree continued to live with White, whose household was expanding. White took on a convict mistress named Rachel Turner, who had arrived with the Second Fleet in 1790. The couple had a baby in 1793. White was also assigned a convict artist named Thomas Watling, who became friends with Nanbaree and drew portraits of him and other Dharug people; the portraits later became part of the Watling Collection. In 1794, White returned to England, leaving Nanbaree in Sydney without a patron.\nAdulthood\nNanbaree and others participating in an Aboriginal initiation ceremony near Sydney in 1795\nWith White gone, Nanbaree became somewhat more aligned with his Aboriginal relatives. In January 1795, he underwent an initiation ceremony called yoolang erah-badiang with several other boys at Farm Cove. The British were allowed to observe and document the event, in which Nanbaree and the other initiates had one of their upper incisor teeth ritually evulsed. In a break from tradition, Nanbaree's extracted tooth was given to the Judge Advocate, David Collins.\nAs the British colony expanded throughout the greater Sydney area, Aboriginal life became increasingly fractured. Factional feuds between Nanbaree's kin and the remnants of other clans escalated in 1797 when Nanbaree's uncle, Colebe, killed a young rival named ",
    "Spanish footballer\nAlfredo Arr\u00f3niz Vidal (15 September 1902 \u2013 15 May 1976) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Valencia CF and CD Castell\u00f3n.\nBiography\nAlfredo Arr\u00f3niz was born on 15 September 1902 in Murcia, but lived most of his life in Valencia, where he began his sporting career at Gimn\u00e1stico FC in 1923, featuring alongside the likes of Silvino and Enrique Molina. Initially, he played as a forward, becoming one of the best scorers in the region. His good performance eventually drew the attention of Valencia CF, who signed him in the summer of 1925, making his debut on 19 July against Nataci\u00f3n de Alicante. In his first season at the club, he played 32 games, scored 3 goals and won a regional champion\u00a0, which he won again in his second and last campaign with the club. While at Valencia, he showed himself as a player of determination and courage, sometimes more concerned with the fight with the opponent than with finishing the plays. The presence of Arturo Montesinos moved him to the right wing, where he had to play as a winger without being able to show off his best qualities. On 1 May 1926, he played a friendly match against Real Madrid, scoring once to help his side to an epic 4\u20133 victory.\nIn 1927, Arr\u00f3niz returned to Gimn\u00e1stico, and on his first visit to Mestalla Stadium on 8 December 1927, he provided a spectacular assist to Silvino for his side's second goal in an eventual 2\u20134 loss, but at the end of the match he was sent off along with Francisco Reyes because he \"had harassed Lluch in a bad way, who had fallen to the ground; the referee finally put the matter to rest by inviting them to end the discussion off the field\". Then he went to Castell\u00f3n de la Plana, where he settled permanently and married in December 1929, becoming one of the most important players of the club, winning two Regional Championships in 1929 and 1930. He returned to Mestalla on several occasions, always starring in great and controversial performances. He ended his career at Sport Club de La Plana\u00a0 in 1935.\nHonours\nValencia CF\nValencia Championship:\nWinners (2) 1926 and 1927\nCD Castell\u00f3n\nValencia Championship:\nWinners (2) 1929 and 1930\n",

    "Genus of lichens\nKnightiellastrum is a single-species fungal genus in the family Icmadophilaceae. This monotypic genus the contains the corticolous (bark-dwelling), squamulose lichen species Knightiellastrum eucalypti, found in Tasmania, Australia.\nTaxonomy\nThis lichen was originally described by Gintaras Kantvilas in 2011. It was first identified from specimens collected in Tasmania, Australia, where it was found on the moist trunks of old Eucalyptus obliqua trees in mixed forests. The type specimen was collected by Kantvilas along Hartz Road near the entrance to the Hartz Mountains National Park, and is stored at the Tasmanian Herbarium with duplicates at the British Museum.\nKantvilas provisionally classified the species in Icmadophila. This genus is characterised by a crustose to squamulose thallus that contains thamnolic acid and hosts a Coccomyxa-type photobiont. The genus is typically recognized for its sessile to stipitate fruiting bodies and Icmadophila-type asci. The original classification of Icmadophila eucalypti within this genus was based on its morphological, anatomical, ecological, and chemical features, although, as explained by Kantvilas, this placement was provisional due to unsuccessful attempts to confirm its taxonomy through DNA analysis. Further uncertainty regarding the generic placement was added by the absence of apothecia.\nSubsequent molecular phylogenetics analysis suggested that this Tasmanian endemic species does not align closely with Icmadophila. Instead, it shares closer ties with the genera Thamnolia and Knightiella, and is distantly related to Icmadophila. As a result, the species was reclassified in 2018 by Kantvilas as Knightiella eucalypti. This reassignment was supported by similar morphological traits and ecological niches between Knightiella eucalypti and other species within Knightiella, alongside their shared geographical distribution.\nFurther phylogenetic analyses using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and nuclear large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (nuLSU) gene sequences clarified the taxonomic position of Icmadophila eucalypti, leading to its reclassification into the new genus Knightiellastrum. These studies revealed that Icmadophila, as previously understood, was not a monophyletic group. Icmadophila eucalypti, now referred to as Knightiellastrum eucalypti, and Icmadophila splachnirima (renamed to Knightiella splachnirima) are distantly related to each other and also to the core Icmadophila species, which include I.\u00a0ericetorum, I.\u00a0aversa, and I.\u00a0japonica. The separation was strongly supported by Bayesian inference, showing Knightiellastrum eucalypti as sister to a large clade containing traditional Icmadophila species and other related genera. This restructuring reflects significant phylogenetic distinctions warranting a new genus, confirming earlier provisional assignments based solely on non-molecular characteristics.\nEtymology\nThe species name, eucalypti, reflects the lichen's common association with eucalyptus trees. The genus name Knightiellastrum combines Knightiella with the Latin suffix -astrum, suggesting a partial resemblance. This designation reflects that the thallus morphology of the type species vaguely echoes that of a smaller, infertile Knightiella splachnirima.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Knightiellastrum eucalypti is squamulose, showing colours ranging from whitish to pale grey, and occasionally with hints of pale bluish, creamish, or beige. It forms expansive, irregular colonies that can reach up to 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) in width. The individual squamules vary in size from 1 to 5\u00a0mm across, and have an uneven thickness between 130 and 350\u00a0\u03bcm. These squamules are densely packed with crystals that shine under polarised light and dissolve in a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\nThe squamules emerge from a diffuse, very thin, and ephemeral primary thallus that appears white. They are scattered and discrete or overlapping, rarely merging into each other. The shapes of the squamules are notably diverse, ranging from stellate and rosette-like forms to flabellate arrangements. Typically, one side of the squamule adheres closely to the substrate while the other side ascends. The edges are initially finely toothed and somewhat thickened, but they soon develop nodules, small lobes, or palmate lobes and become slightly shrubby (subfruticulose) in appearance. The upper surface of the squamules is matt, smooth, or minutely rough, featuring a pseudocortex made up of randomly oriented, short hyphae measuring 3\u20135\u00a0\u03bcm wide, interspersed with occasional dead algal cells.\nThe lower surface is white and lacks a cortical layer (ecorticate). Soredia, which are coarse granular structures about 40\u201380\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter and the same colour as the thallus, emerge along the margins of the squamules. These soredia begin to erode the margins and spread across the upper surface.\nThe photobiont of Knightiellastrum eucalypti is a unicellular green alga, which forms spherical cells betwe",
    "Australian guest house owner (1873\u20131942)\nThe Meyers residence with the family standing at the front, this would later become 'Stuarts Guest Home', 1908\nStuarts Guest Home, sometimes referred to as Mrs Meyers' Guest House, in 1951\nThe Charlie Meyers Saddlery on Todd Street\nAnnie Meyers (7 July 1873 \u2013 25 January 1942) was the owner of the first guest house called 'Stuarts Guest Home', sometimes referred to as 'Mrs Meyers Guest House', in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory.\nEarly life\nMeyers was born in Cornwall and immigrated with her family the Moonta, South Australia when she was three years old. In Moonta her family worked as copper miners.\nLife in the Northern Territory\nMeyers moved to Alice Springs, then known as Stuart, in the late 1890s and began working at the Stuart Arms Hotel which was then being leased by Thomas and Maryanne Gunther. Little is known of her early life but her sister, Elizabeth (Bessie) Williams also lived in Stuart and later married Ernest Allchurch, who was then employed at a telegraphist at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station where he would later become the postmaster.\nOn 23 May 1897 Meyers married saddler Aaron Schunke (Charlie) Meyers at the hotel, where she was still working, and the wedding was officiated by the Lutheran Pastor John Bogner from Hermannsburg. Following their marriage the purchased a block of land on Todd Street, what is now the Todd Mall, and established a saddlery. This saddlery, known as \"Charlie Meyer's Saddlery\" was at the Southern end of the street and was a simple structure with whitewashed stone walls, a thatched roof  and a verandah constructed of wooden packing cases. Meyers and Charlie lived a short distance away, on the Todd River and, by 1908, had three living children: Dorothy, Herman John (Jack) and Gwendoline (Gwen); they had lost an infant daughter Henrietta some years before. Meyers and her sister supported each other through their pregnancies and deliveries.\nMeyers marriage was not a happy one and in 1909 she decided to leave Alice Springs and take her children 'south', likely to Adelaide, for schooling. She did not return until 1924 when her sister also came back. When Meyers returned she and her husband Charlie were still estranged and he was spending much of his time working at Haasts Bluff where he ran cattle cattle and coming back to Alice Springs regularly for his saddlery and home-brew businesses. Meyers returned to their home on the river and, over the next two years, turned it into 'Stuarts Guest Home', the first boarding house in the town, which opened in 1926.\nThe guest home included a large vegetable garden, with many fruit trees and a large poultry run and, with these in place, she soon gained a reputation for serving the \"best food in town\". She applied for a liquor license in 1929 but was declined; she was, however, granted a publicans license in 1930 and the foundations for a new building were prepared but did not eventuate. Meyers blamed this on the Great Depression and the failure of The Granites gold mine.\nMeyers gave up the guest home in the late 1930s and then moved to Adelaide and, later, to Boulder (Western Australia) where she lived with her daughter Gwen. She died there on 25 January 1942.\nLegacy\nOlive Pink was a regular visitor at the 'Stuarts Guest Home' when she was working as an anthropologist at Thompsons Rockhole, which necessitated frequent visits to Alice Springs, and it was she who asked that, what was gazetted \"Meyers Hill\", be named \"Annie Meyers Hill\", part of Olive Pink Botanic Garden, after her. The Arrernte language name for this site is Tharrarletneme and it is a sacred site for Arrernte people.\n",

The first battle of V\u00ebrrin was fought on July 16 1998. During the period from September 1 to 5, 1998, Yugoslav Milicija units conducted an operation against the KLA. As part of this action, KLA positions located near Prizren, in the villages of Lez, Je\u0161kovo, Ku\u0161tendil, Ljubi\u010devo, and Ho\u010da Zagradska were attacked. However, the primary engagement occurred in the village of Jeshkovo. The area where these villages are situated is referred to as V\u00ebrrin by Albanians, hence the designation \"Battle of V\u00ebrrin.\" This was the first battle in the Prizren District during the Kosovo War.\nBackground\nOn July 7,  1998, Yugoslav forces failed to liquidate a KLA unit in Billushe and were forced to retreat. The Yugoslav army and police pledged retaliation for the ambush, strategizing an offensive against KLA positions in what had been declared a KLA free zone.\nFirst Battle\nAround 1:30 PM, the Yugoslav forces tried to enter from the Tusus neighborhood, in the direction of Leskovec, Lybe\u00e7eva, and towards the village of Ho\u00e7\u00eb e Qytetit. KLA forces started attacking the Yugoslav forces. The first day of confrontation between the two forces lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes. On the part of the KLA soldiers, there were neither killed nor injured, while the Yugoslav forces were separated with losses.\nSecond Battle\nOn Monday, August 31, Yugoslav Police surrounded Lez. By Tuesday morning, September 1, 1998, around 8:00 a.m, they commenced shelling KLA positions in the hills surrounding the village. The villagers fled to nearby Ljubi\u010devo, while the KLA members remained. The night before the second offensive, the KLA had information about large movements of Yugoslav troops around the territories where the KLA positions were located. The KLA soldiers were all in a state of readiness in their positions, with the command of the 125th brigade being put into action.\nThe 1st Battalion observed Yugoslav movements towards the top of Cyileni, commanders Salajdin Berisha and Xhevat Berisha with a part of the soldiers went to Cyilen. On September 1, 1998, at around 7 am, Yugoslav forces began the offensive against KLA positions. Initially, the attack began in the village of Lez, where fierce fighting took place and Yugoslav forces were met with heavy resistance. At a postion called Livadhet te Lavdices, a grenade exploded in the trench at this position, resulting in the deaths of four KLA members. Additionally, six KLA members were killed in the same position during the exchange of fire with the police. 3 more KLA soldiers were killed. Those killed were identified as KLA soldiers Xhevat Berisha, Salajdin Berisha, Shefqet Berisha, Hasim Berisha, Nehat Berisha, Alajdin Berisha, Bekim Berisha, Shahadin Berisha, Naip Berisha, Samidin Emini, Ibrahim Osmani, Asllan Berisha, and Izair Berisha.\nThe fighting soon spread throughout the territory of V\u00ebrrin. The Yugoslav forces shelled the positions of the 2nd Battalion from a distance, while the Yugoslav infantry tried to enter the positions of the 1st Battalion. Around 5 pm, Yugoslav forces broke through a KLA position and captured Lez. In Lez, three policemen were wounded: Miroslav Rakonjac was wounded by automatic weapons around 2:00 p.m., while Miroljub Risti\u0107 was seriously wounded, and Nenad Aleksi\u0107 was lightly wounded by soldiers using automatic weapons, hand-held launchers, and mortars around 4:20 p.m.\nDuring the same night, while KLA soldiers were observing the terrain between the villages of Kushnin and Arb\u00ebri, the soldiers Tamil Shala, Refki Shala and Milaim Tha\u00e7i were ambushed. Yugoslav forces began penetrating towards the territory which was under KLA control. Kushnin, Arb\u00ebria, Lez, the headquarters of the 125th Brigade in Jeshkovo and the village itself, Ho\u00e7a e Qytetit, Kushtrimi, Billush\u00eb, Poslisht as well as the KLA positions in V\u00ebrrin were shelled constantly by the Yugoslav forces. The shelling led to civilian casualties.\nThe fighting continued on September 2, fierce fighting was concentrated in the village of Jeshkovo because of the Yugoslav goal of penetrating the headquarters of the 125th Brigade, which was located in Jeshkovo. During the afternoon of September 2, Agim Shala, Avdi Shala, Besim Shala, and Fatmir Berisha died.\nHeavy shelling continued at Kushtrim and Billush\u00eb, and Yugoslav forces tried to enter Dushkaja of Poslisht, then the positions of Tusus. After some positions of the 1st Battalion were broken, the position at Tusus was in danger and the command of the 1st Battalion retreats to the village of Arb\u00ebri, while the 2nd Battalion remained at their positions. Astret Poniku, and Arsim Poniku were killed. KLA forces held their positions against the Yugoslav forces, and Jeshkova was under KLA control.\n",
    "\nIn Haiti, the disruption of the water cycle remains a major environmental challenge, affecting biodiversity and the daily lives of the country's inhabitants. The problem has multiple causes, including the proliferation of shantytowns and the absence of a comprehensive urban development policy. Global warming is one of the main causes of this problem, faced with one of the most disastrous economic, social and political situations on the planet, Haiti is unable to implement an urban development policy. On the other hand, deforestation encourages natural disasters. Thus, the disruption of the water cycle remains a lasting threat to the country's development.\nHydrological context in Haiti\nLocated in the Caribbean, Haiti is exposed to a considerable ecological imbalance, characterized by catastrophic floods associated with torrential rains and hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, extreme climatic and meteorological variations that disrupt the water cycle. These problems are exacerbated by deforestation, soil degradation and unsustainable agricultural practices. Climate change, pollution and deforestation are the main causes of water cycle disruption in cities and slums. These causes include an increase in ocean water temperature, and a considerable reduction in the quantity of water available at groundwater level.\nEnvironmental impact\nClimate change is often described as one of the most pressing environmental challenges we face worldwide. Long-term changes in temperature and precipitation are often accompanied by heat waves and intense rainfall, increasing the risk of flooding, especially in Caribbean countries such as Haiti.\nFloods, droughts and the degradation of aquatic ecosystems are examples of the effects of disruption of the water cycle. Shortages of drinking water also aggravate public health problems.\nFloods, torrential rains, droughts, changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation and water scarcity are just some of the consequences of these disturbances. Important steps can be taken to reduce these disturbances, such as water conservation, protecting aquatic ecosystems, reducing pollution and promoting sustainable management of water resources, reforestation to preserve watersheds, improving agricultural techniques to reduce erosion, and adopting more efficient technologies for water management.\nClimatic disturbances are also the cause of numerous infectious diseases, including vector-borne diseases transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods such as dengue fever, Zika, chikungunya and malaria.\nClimate change is often described as one of the most pressing environmental challenges challenges we face worldwide.\nLong-term changes in temperature and precipitation are often accompanied by heat waves heat waves and intense rainfall, increasing the risk of flooding, particularly in countries Caribbean countries such as Haiti.\nConsequences\nDisruption of the water cycle has a greater impact on physical ecosystems than temperature variations. ecosystems, which are sensitive to changes in hydro-climatic conditions.

    "Historic house in Raleigh, North Carolina\nNorris-Heartt House, also known as Norris House and Heartt House, is a historic Victorian house in Raleigh, North Carolina. The home was built in 1879 and was given as a wedding present for the socialite Cornelia Alice Norris. Following her death in 1935, it was purchased by Leo D. Heartt and converted into a boarding house. It was acquired by the state government in 1968 and housed the offices of the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the North Carolina State Office of Archaeology. It was vacated in 2007. The house underwent renovations from 2016 to 2018 and is now used as a private event venue.\nHistory\nNorris-Heartt House was constructed on North Blount Street in 1879 by Alexander Boyd Andrews and was purchased by Jesse Allen Norris and Amy Ann Adams Norris as a wedding present for their daughter, Cornelia Alice Norris, and her husband, the merchant Matthew Tyson Norris. Her parents deeded the house exclusively in her name, not her husband's. The Norrises lived their entire married lives in the home and raised their five children in it. Cornelia Norris was a prominent Raleigh socialite who founded the Caswell-Nash Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the local press wrote about her entertaining in the home.\nMatthew Norris died in 1915. Following Cornelia's death in 1935, the house was sold to Leo D. Heartt. The Heartt family enlarged the house, converted it into a boarding house, and removed the original Italianate designs on the front, as well as interior decorative trim and some of the fireplaces, and replaced them with colonial features.\nIn 1968, the state government acquired the house from Heartt's widow and converted it into an office building housing the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the North Carolina State Office of Archaeology. The state archaeology office used the house as a curation space for artifacts and site files as well as an office space. The state's artifacts were relocated to a new research center in 1997 and the state office moved into the North Carolina Archives and History Building in 2007.\nAfter being vacant and falling into disrepair under government ownership, the house was sold and began being renovated in 2016, finishing in 2018. The 1930s addition of a two-story Colonial Revival front porch was removed and replaced with the original style Italianate Victorian front elevation. The Italianate elevation was made following historical records and the original masonry foundation, unearthed on site in April 2017. The house interior includes original doors, trim, stained glass windows, and a fireplace with mantel. The house is now used as a venue for private events.\n",

    "Lithuanian American publisher and banker (1863\u20131942)\nAntanas Ol\u0161auskas (June 13, 1863 \u2013 May 10, 1942) was a Lithuanian American businessman. He was the published of the Lithuanian weekly Lietuva and founder of A. Olszewski Bank.\nOrphaned at an early age, Ol\u0161auskas did not receive any formal education. He worked as a carpenter before emigrating to the United States at the age of 25. He managed to get a job at a Polish printing press. In 1893, he took over the struggling Lithuanian weekly newspaper Lietuva and turned it around. It became a popular liberal periodical. He then established A. Olszewski Bank which served the Lithuanian American community. It became successful and customer deposits peaked at $1 million. Ol\u0161auskas used customer deposits to build offices and open other business ventures (Theater Milda, clothing shop, car dealership, residential real estate). A bank run in 1916 forced him to sell these businesses and liquidate the bank. However, he was able to raise capital and establish the Universal State Bank in 1917. After quarrels with the new leadership of the Universal State Bank, Ol\u0161auskas resigned in 1919. He then made a modest living selling ship tickets and insurance.\nBiography\nEarly life\nOl\u0161auskas was born on June 13, 1863, in A\u0161truliai\u00a0, a small village near Liudvinavas, to a family of petty Lithuanian nobles. He was orphaned at the age of four and his family's farm was sold off for debts. He was raised by his maternal grandparents who taught him basic literacy skills. Ol\u0161auskas never received any formal education. Due to poor health, he could not perform hard physical labor and searched for better means of living. He learned carpentry and worked to construct furniture, repair church altars, etc. For two years, he worked to restore the Catholic church in Krasnopol. In 1889, having saved 300 rubles, Ol\u0161auskas decided to emigrate to the United States.\nPublisher of Lietuva\nHe arrived to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in April 1889. He tried to pursue carpentry, but could not get a better job due to poor English language skills. Ol\u0161auskas was inspired by the example of two Lithuanian businessmen who published the Lithuanian newspaper Vienyb\u0117 lietuvinink\u0173 and pursued jobs at emigrant publishing houses. Eventually, he was hired by the Polish Gazeta Polska published in Chicago. In 1892, Ol\u0161auskas worked as a typesetter for Polish newspaper Nowe \u017bycie but it went bankrupt. He convinced the new owner, Stasys Rako\u0161ius, to publish the first Lithuanian newspaper in Chicago Lietuva. The first issue was published on December 6, 1892, but Rako\u0161ius sold the printing press to Vincas \u017daliauskas who fired Ol\u0161auskas.\nThe printing press of Lietuva continued to struggle. Ol\u0161auskas and three other men agreed to take it over for US$300 (equivalent to $10,173 in 2023). Ol\u0161auskas was primarily in charge of content starting with the 24th issue. The newspaper became a liberal publication which advocated for unity among Lithuanian immigrants, campaigned for a Lithuanian representative in the U.S. Congress, promoted entrepreneurship and self-improvement, discussed relations between Poles and Lithuanians, debated political issues concerning Lithuania. The newspaper gained popularity and the printing press relocated to more spacious premises in 1894. Experienced journalist Juozas Adomaitis-\u0160ernas became chief editor of Lietuva in December 1895.\nIn addition to publishing Lietuva, the printing house also published Lithuanian books. In 1894\u20131917, it published a total of 131 books, of which 45 were original and others were translations. These included 28 books on fairytales, legends, novellas, 31 theater plays, 20 popular science works, 15 texts on history, ethnography, culture, and three dictionaries.\nBanker\nOl\u0161auskas became known as a reliable man. Thus, Lithuanians began bringing him sums of money for safekeeping. This inspired Ol\u0161auskas to establish a bank which primarily served as a bank of the Lithuanian American community. He built two-floor house on the 33rd Street for $5,000 (equivalent to $183,120 in 2023) in 1896. He lived on the second floor, while the first floor had the printing press, bookstore, and A. Olszewski Bank. The business was going well and Ol\u0161auskas was able to buy out other owners of Lietuva remaining the sole shareholder of the printing press in 1901. In 1905, socialists inspired printing press workers to go on strike. When Lietuva missed an issue, rumors spread that Ol\u0161auskas was going bankrupt, but his bank withstood a bank run and continued to grow. Customer deposits at A. Olszewski Bank peaked at $1 million. Lithuanians sent some $4 million to relatives at home via the bank in 1895\u20131914.\nIn 1906, Ol\u0161auskas decided to build three-floor house on the corner of 33rd and Halsted Street at a cost of $100,000 (equivalent to $3,391,111 in 2023). It housed not only the printing press and bank, but also a clothing store, medical offices, and rented apartments. He used customer deposits for other business ven",
    "\nJoseph Maria Louis, Prince of Lorraine-Vaud\u00e9mont (23 June 1759 \u2013 29 March 1812) served as an Austrian general during the French Revolutionary Wars. Born into a noble family in France, he went into exile in 1791 during the French Revolution and offered his services to the Habsburg monarchy. He fought in the Austrian army during the War of the First Coalition, rising in rank from leading a cavalry regiment to commanding a brigade. He led a division during the War of the Second Coalition and the War of the Third Coalition. He died in Hungary in 1812.\nEarly career\nJoseph Maria Louis, Prince of Lorraine-Vaud\u00e9mont was born on 23 June 1759 in Paris, in the Kingdom of France. His father was Louis, Prince of Brionne (1725\u20131761) and his mother was Louise Julie Constant of Rohan. His older brother was Charles Eugene, Prince of Lambesc (1751\u20131825) and his sisters were Princess Jos\u00e9phine of Lorraine (1753\u20131797) and Princess Charlotte of Lorraine (1755\u20131786). He married Louise Auguste de Montmorency-Logny in 1778. When his father died, his 10-year-old older brother Charles became the head of the family. Sometime after he turned 26-years-old, Charles became the proprietor of the Royal Allemand Dragoon Regiment, a unit recruited from Germans loyal to the French crown. After the outbreak of the French Revolution, Charles, his younger brother Joseph, and the entire Royal Allemand Regiment went into exile. On 1 February 1793, the unit was accepted into Austrian service and in 1798 was named the Lorraine Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 10.\nWar of the First Coalition\nOn 7 June 1791, vice president of the Hofkriegsrat Ferdinand Tige announced the appointment of the Prince of Vaud\u00e9mont as Oberst (colonel) in the Austrian army. Vaud\u00e9mont was assigned to the Austrian Netherlands under the command of Blasius Columban, Baron von Bender. In February 1792, he was appointed commander of the Coburg Dragoon Regiment Nr. 37. He fought at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792. At that battle, the regiment was split, with four squadrons assigned to the Center and four squadrons serving with the Reserve. On 8 March 1793, he was promoted to Generalmajor. In early 1795, Vaud\u00e9mont commanded a heavy cavalry brigade in Gottlieb Friedrich von Schmertzing's division on the lower Rhine River. He transferred to the Army of the Upper Rhine under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser.\nWhen Wurmser was sent to northern Italy, the Prince of Vaud\u00e9mont served under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour in the Army of the Upper Rhine as a commander of cuirassiers. During the Rhine campaign of 1796, he led his cavalry at the Battle of Ettlingen on 9 July, the Battle of Neresheim on 11 August, the Battle of W\u00fcrzburg on 3 September, and the Battle of Schliengen on 24 October. He was promoted Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 1 March 1797 to rank from 20 February 1797. In September 1797, he commanded the Second Meeting of the Imperial and Royal Army camp at Villingen.\nWar of the Second Coalition\nBattle of Stockach, 25 March 1799\nIn March 1799, the Prince of Vaud\u00e9mont served in the army of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen in Swabia. He commanded a brigade that consisted of the Kaiser Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 1 and the Duke Albert Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 3. He was successful leading his cavalry at the Battle of Stockach on 25 March 1799. He commanded an infantry division at the First Battle of Zurich on 4\u20137 June 1799. For his good leadership at Zurich, Archduke Charles wrote a letter of commendation to Emperor Francis. At Zurich, Vaud\u00e9mont's division included two battalions each of the Kaiser Infantry Regiment Nr. 1 and Gemmingen Infantry Regiment Nr. 21, two squadrons of the Waldeck Dragoon Regiment Nr. 7, and one squadron of the Motschlitz Uhlan Regiment Nr. 1.\nIn the 1800 campaign, Paul Kray commanded the army in Swabia. In the Battles of Stockach and Engen on 3 May 1800, Jean Victor Marie Moreau managed to concentrate 84,000 French troops against 72,000 Austrians. At Engen the main armies fought to a draw, but at Stockach the French massed 20,000 men under Claude Lecourbe against the Prince of Vaud\u00e9mont's 12,000 Austrians. Lecourbe defeated him and drove the Austrians out of Stockach, capturing its supply base. This event convinced Kray to retreat. Two days later at the Battle of Messkirch the two armies clashed again. Kray posted Vaud\u00e9mont on his left flank to hold the town of Messkirch supported by strong artillery batteries. A French division led by Joseph Montrichard made a frontal assault but was repulsed. Later, Montrichard's division returned to the attack from the south, together with a second division under Dominique Vandamme that struck from the southeast. Finally, Vaud\u00e9mont abandoned Messkirch when he was outflanked. Kray withdrew his army to Sigmaringen that night.\nLater career\nOn 7 October 1803, Emperor Francis appointed the Prince of Vaud\u00e9mont the second inhaber of Kaiser Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 1. In 1805, he commanded a cavalry division in the Army of Ita",

Despite the gravity of his crimes, Gorin was given a lenient sentence of 22 years imprisonment after he was convicted in 2018.\nIn early 2023, while in a penal colony, Gorin signed a contract with a PMC and was sent to Ukraine to participate in the Russian invasion of the country. Gorin fought in the ranks of the Storm-Z and was wounded during a battle, after which President Vladimir Putin pardoned him and allowed him to return to his hometown. This act sparked outrage across Russia, causing great debate about the morality of pardoning criminals to fight in the ongoing war.\nEarly life\nVery little is known about the early years of Denis Gorin's life. He was born on November 15, 1979, in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, Khabarovsk Krai, but later in life, his family moved to Aniva, in the Sakhalin Oblast. He has one brother named Evgeniy and a sister whose name is not known to the public.\nWhile living in the town, Gorin was regarded well by locals, as he was not known to engage in any criminal activities or aggressive behaviors. After graduating from high school, he married and had two children, but the family began experiencing financial struggles later on due to Gorin's lack of high education. In the early 2000s, Gorin became an alcoholic and started living on the streets.\nMurders\nFirst murder and imprisonment\nIn late 2002, the then-23-year-old Gorin committed his first known murder, with the victim being an acquaintance of his. He was arrested a short time later and charged with murder and desecrating a corpse. At trial, Gorin stated that after killing the victim, he cut off the soft tissues of his body and then ate them, claiming that he had done so under the threats of his brother Evgeniy, an accomplice who threatened to kill him if he didn't cannibalize the victim.\nOn March 6, 2003, Gorin was sentenced to 9 years and 11 months imprisonment in a strict regime colony, which he served at an undisclosed location in the Irkutsk Oblast. After serving seven years, he was paroled on April 19, 2010, and returned to Aniva, where he continued to live on the streets for the next two years. During this period, he never worked and earned his money by doing odd jobs and stealing, spending most of his time among other homeless people and alcoholics.\nSerial murders\nIn June 2011, the Gorin brothers became enraged after learning that their nephew had been abused by an acquaintance, after which they went to the apartment to confront him. However, once they got inside, they instead beat up a young man, who was not involved, to the point of unconsciousness. Taking advantage of the fact that he was knocked out, Denis proceeded to slit his throat. After that, the two brothers carried the body to the bank of the Lyutoga River, where they buried it in a shallow grave. The victim's body was discovered in the spring of 2012.\nThe next murder the brothers committed took place during the celebration of the Old New Year, on the night of January 14\u201315, 2012. The two were at the \"Cheremushki\" store when they got into some sort of conflict with an acquaintance, whom Denis proceeded to stab at least 29 times with a knife; the man would later succumb to the injuries. That same day, Gorin was arrested by the police and immediately began confessing. On February 27, 2013, he was convicted of the two murders and sentenced to 20 years and 10 months imprisonment. His brother Evgeniy did not live to see the trial; in mid-2012, he died while incarcerated at a temporary detention center in Aniva under unclear circumstances.\nConfession to unsolved murder\nAfter the trial, Gorin was transferred to a penal colony. In June 2017, he contacted the Sakhalin Oblast Prosecutor's Office and confessed to an unsolved murder, after which he was transported back to Aniva to give testimony. According to him, this killing was committed on November 21, 2010, with the victim being another acquaintance named Alexander, whose brother Denis had been incarcerated at a temporary detention center from February 25 to March 6, 2003. While drinking together, Gorin recalled an incident that seemed amusing to him: while he and Alexander's brother had been incarcerated at the detention center, a drunken Alexander attempted to deliver a parcel to his brother but was detained for disorderly conduct because of his state of intoxication. Alexander seemed to be annoyed by this story, causing them to have an argument and separate.\nThat same evening, after attending his ex-wife's birthday party, an intoxicated Gorin decided to go to Alexander's house to resolve their argument from earlier. However, they instead continued arguing, whereupon Gorin grabbed a knife and stabbed Alexander twice in the chest. After killing him",

    "The term iron frame describes the structural use of either cast iron or wrought iron in the columns and beams of a building. While popular in the 19th century, the iron frame was displaced by the steel frame in the early 20th century.\nCast iron\nSee also: Cast iron architecture\nCast iron frame in Watervliet Arsenal building 40 (c.\u20091840)\nColumns made of cast iron were introduced in 1770s, the first building with multiple storeys using cast iron for both columns and beams is the Ditherington Flax Mill in Shrewsbury (1797). Columns were joined usually at the floor level and sometimes bolted together, the longer beams were made of sections that were also kept together by bolts. At first,  the stiffness of the frame was achieved through the use of masonry that filled the openings in the frame, but since 1844, a rigid frame was used that was stable by itself (former fire station at the Portsmouth Dockyard).\nWith its high compression strength, the cast iron is well-suited for columns. At first, the cruciform profile was used, later displaced by the hollow round shape and H-beams. Relative tensile weakness made the cast iron not the best choice for the beams and girders, this was compensated by making the bottom flange of an I-beam (the one experiencing the tension) much wider than the top, compressed, one and varying the beam profile to be wider at the middle, where the stress was higher. Cast iron was rapidly replaced in the beams by the wrought iron in the mid-19th century, the process had accelerated after the Dee Bridge disaster of 1847.\nWrought iron\nUse of wrought iron in construction has a long history (cramps made from wrought iron were used in classical antiquity). The first all-wrought iron roof was apparently installed in 1837 at the Euston railway station in London.\nFrame of the Crystal Palace\nBeams and girders were made of wrought iron with I-beam cross-section. The material was rarely used for the columns, as the cast was both stronger under compression and cheaper, so a typical iron frame building in the second half of the 19th century had cast iron columns and wrought iron beams. Columns at the Crystal Palace (1851), as well as short trusses, were made from the cast iron, while longer beams used wrought iron. A less-known precursor to the modern steel frame construction, the four-storey Boat Store (\"Shed 78\", 1858\u20131860), has its rigid frame constructed also from cast iron columns and wrought iron girders. With no internal walls and external walls made from sheet metal, the stability of this structure is provided exclusively through the rigid column-beam joints.\n",

    "2024 video game\n2024 video game\nHarold Halibut is a 2024 video game developed by German independent developer Slow Bros for Windows, the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5. The game is a narrative-based adventure video game in which players control Harold, a janitor on a spacecraft submerged in an alien planet, and complete odd tasks for the ship's inhabitants. The game was created over a ten-year development process, first conceived as an unfunded part-time project to create a narrative game inspired by stop-motion animation. To implement a stop-motion aesthetic, the developers hand-made characters, objects and environments using various materials scanned into the game and animated in the Unity engine. During development, the game received several features, nominations and accolades for video game, film and culture festivals. Upon release, Harold Halibut received mixed to average reviews, with critics praising the ambition and detail of the game's visual presentation and the themes in its narrative, although critiquing the game's narrative focus as lacking puzzles and interactivity and having a slow pace. \nGameplay\nThe game's adventure gameplay is a linear, story-driven experience that takes place across six chapters. Players navigate the interior districts of the Fedora and interact or overhear conversations from its characters to progress the story. Characters provide the players with tasks, some necessary to complete the game and others optional, which are logged as a to-do list in a PDA menu. Completion of tasks requires simple point-and-click interactions with objects in the game, with some tasks involving small puzzles or minigames, such as cleaning a room through a Tetris-based minigame. Optional interactive minigames can be played in an arcade on the Fedora.\nPlot\nDuring the peak of the Cold War in the 1970s, the space ship Fedora I, controlled by the All Water corporation, was sent from Earth to find a planet for humankind to colonise. Drifting for over two hundred years, the ship encounters a solar flare and is stranded at the bottom of an alien ocean on an uninhabitable planet, where it has remained for another fifty years. The player is Harold, a shy and withdrawn maintenance worker on the staff of the ship, who assists the scientist Jeanna Mareaux, who is commissioned to look for ways to escape the planet. Harold also performs odd jobs for the other inhabitants, many with different philosophies, including their views on whether to leave the Fedora or stay. When a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to relaunch the craft unaffected by the solar flare and return to home is discovered, Harold is placed in a unique position to make a difference in the future of the ship and its populace. During the game, Harold discovers a fish-like humanoid stuck in the ship's filtration system he names 'Fishy', providing him with a window into the perspective of the alien life on the planet. Harold also discovers the original mission of the Fedora may not have been as essential as its inhabitants believe. \nDevelopment and release\nThe developers of Harold Halibut created all the assets for the game from hand-made materials, including clay, wood, and textiles.\nHarold Halibut was created by Slow Bros., a Cologne studio led by independent developer Onat Hekimo\u011flu, a filmmaker and graduate of the Cologne Game Lab. The development process for the game took place over ten years, with the development team first working on the game on a part-time basis with low funding, and developing in size and commitment as a full-time project over time. In 2012, the initial three-person development team conceived the idea from a conversation about the potential to create a narrative-led video game using stop-motion animation, citing inspiration from classic adventure games and films including Jason and the Argonauts and The Valley of Gwangi. The team also were interested in the use of hand-made assets and stop-motion as they lacked experience in 3D modelling, preferring to leverage their skills of carpentry, sculpture, lighting and costume design to create a game.\nTo create and animate the assets for the game, the development team hand-made puppets, sets, props, and costumes from various materials including clay, textiles, welded metal, and recycled wood. These items were then rendered in 3D using photogrammetry by photographing the objects from all angles, animated as \"digitally rigged\" puppets and imported into the Unity engine. To animate the characters, motion capture was used through a motion tracking rig, which filmed the movements of actors and fit them to the models of the 3D puppets. This approach was taken instead of the originally intended approach of using stop-motion animation for characters to streamline the production process, as art director Ole Tillman stated the original approach was \"too restrictive\" and time-consuming. Hekimo\u011flu estimated that the production process required 200 kilograms of clay. Originally conceived to be ",

    "\nTraditional Azerbaijani yurt (tent)\nAzerbaijani nomadic life- refers to the historical and contemporary practice of individuals or groups living a nomadic (t\u0259r\u0259k\u0259m\u0259) or semi-nomadic (elat) lifestyle within the cultural environment of Azerbaijan, along with its historical, cultural, and customary aspects. Temporary dwellings used by nomads in Azerbaijan include various types such as \"oba, shenlik, s\u0131\u011f\u0131rxana, yataq, bin\u0259, yurd, d\u00fc\u015f\u0259rg\u0259, q\u0131\u015flaq, d\u0259kk\u0259, d\u0259ng\u0259, yaylaq, etc\".

In modern times, this term is used for tribes (t\u0259r\u0259k\u0259m\u0259l\u0259r, qarapapaqlar).\nTat: In its first meaning, used to refer to non-Turkic-speaking populations (Tats) in and outside Iranian Azerbaijan. In its second meaning, used to describe Turkic-speaking populations leading settled lives not affiliated with any tribe, observed only in Iranian Azerbaijan.\nPhysical and human geography\nPlains\nA herd of sheep on a meadow in Guba district\nIn Azerbaijan, as in other Turkic-speaking regions, highland pastures used for nomadic animal husbandry are called \"yaylaq.\" Many of these yaylaqs are located at an altitude of up to 2800 meters above sea level. The ancient yaylaqs where sheep grazed were traditionally situated in the alpine and subalpine meadows of the Greater and Lesser Caucasus mountains. Yaylaq husbandry, known as a profession, emerged during the Early Bronze Age in the Transcaucasian region, particularly in modern Azerbaijan, and had formed by the early millennia BCE.\nYaylaq husbandry was primarily practiced by the population owning pasture lands in mountainous regions. Evidence of this can be seen in the form of cyclopean, sturdy stone structures built for seasonal habitation and defense against sudden attacks from neighboring tribes. Similar constructions to those inhabited by individuals engaged in animal husbandry during the Late Bronze Age can often be found in the yaylaqs of the Lesser Caucasus, such as Xa\u00e7bulaq, Kalbajar, Gadabay, La\u00e7\u0131n, Batabat, as well as in the Ordubad mountains. Yaylaqs in Azerbaijan were extensively utilized until the 1980s.\nComparing archaeological data with the ethnography of Azerbaijan allows us to form an understanding of the nomadic migration pattern and the lifestyle in the yaylaq during ancient times. The population would gather their belongings onto carts and move along with their herds. Upon reaching the designated stop where the road turned into tracks, the property would be unloaded from the carts and loaded onto pack animals. According to historian Teymur Bunyadov, such movements to the yaylaq were already present during the Bronze Age.\nThe main reason for the settlement of Turks in Azerbaijan was the abundance of pastures, vineyards, and orchards, along with favorable conditions for animal husbandry. As a result, Azerbaijan and the region of Iraqi Azerbaijan became yaylaqs and q\u0131\u015flaqs for two million nomads.\nHistorical migration routes\nKhudafarin bridge with 11 arches. XIII century\nThe nomadic routes of the Western region of Azerbaijan began with crossings over the Kura River and continued along the flatlands, switching to mountain trails upon reaching the yaylaqs. Since the Western region's nomadic routes crossed the Kura River, livestock and sheep were ferried across the river using small boats, hence the presence of sailors on the river. The winter quarters of the Western region were located in Garayazi and Jeyranchol, while the summer pastures were in the Shahdag and Murguz ranges. By the late 19th century, the main roads used by the nomads of Gazakh and Elisabethpol districts were primarily Yasamal, Zeyem Valley, Kiran, Sari Yoxush, Qosha Deyirman roads, the road leading to Qizilbulaq yaylaq, and Zada roads. Villagers in the Western region who used the yaylaqs (Poylu, Salahli, Kesaman, and Qarabagli) independently moved via the Jeyranchol-Qedili pass, Annefeld, the German colony, to Morul village, and from there to the yaylaqs via the Yasamal road. In the Shusha district, there were two nomadic routes: along the Kura River, through the Asgeran Valley to Qirqqiz yaylaq, and the road from Khachin to Aylishli, Shusha village, and Kirs mountain. The inhabitants of Javanshir district also used the latter route.\nThe migration routes of the Shirvan nomads extended from the K\u00fcdru winter quarters to the Great Caucasus summer pastures. The directions of these nomadic routes are as follows: H\u0259rmida\u011f\u2014Pa\u015fal\u0131\u2014Udulu\u2014Yavann\u0131 mountain\u2014M\u0259r\u0259z\u0259\u2014Hilmilli\u2014Dibrar, Gird\u0259-Pirsaat v",

    "Species of spider\nEvarcha zougoussi is  a species of jumping spider in the genus Evarcha that lives in Ethiopia. The species was first described in 2022 by Wanda Weso\u0142owska and Anthony Russell-Smith. It is a comparatively large spider, with an oval cephalothorax measuring between 2.7 and 3.3\u00a0mm (0.11 and 0.13\u00a0in) long and an ovoid abdomen between 3 and 3.5\u00a0mm (0.12 and 0.14\u00a0in) long. It has a pattern of a light streak down its carapace, the top of its cephalothorax, and a series of spots on its abdomen. In comparison, the spider's sternum, or underside of the cephalothorax, is a plain yellow. Its legs are generally light brown. Although only the female has been identified, it is clear that the spider's copulatory organs are distinctive, including the existence of a deep pocket in its epigyne and its bean-shaped spermathecae.\nTaxonomy\nEvarcha zougoussi is a species of jumping spider that was first described by Wanda Weso\u0142owska and Anthony Russell-Smith in 2022. It was one of over 500 species identified by the Polish arachnologist Weso\u0142owska during her career, making her one of the most prolific in the field. Despite reservations, mainly due to the unusually large size of the spider, they allocated it to the genus Evarcha rather than Hyllus. The species is named for the place where it was first found.\nFirst circumscribed by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1902, Evarcha is one of the largest genera of jumping spiders, with members found on four continents. In 1976, Jerzy Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski placed the genus in the subfamily Pelleninae, along with the genera Bianor and Pellenes. In Wayne Maddison's 2015 study of spider phylogenetic classification, the genus Evarcha was moved to the subtribe Plexippina. This is a member of the tribe Plexippini, in the subclade Simonida in the clade Saltafresia. It is closer to the genera Hyllus and Plexippus. Analysis of protein-coding genes showed it was particularly related to Telamonia. In the following year, Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski added the genus to a group of genera named Evarchines, named after the genus, along with Hasarinella and Nigorella based on similarities in the spiders' copulatory organs. In 2018, Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski attempted to split the genus, but this has proved controversial and has not been universally accepted.\nDescription\nEvarcha zougoussi is a comparative large spider. The spider's body is divided into two main parts: a rather rounded oval cephalothorax and an ovoid abdomen that is shaped more like a tear-drop. The female has a cephalothorax that is between 2.7 and 3.3\u00a0mm (0.11 and 0.13\u00a0in) long and 2.4 and 2.8\u00a0mm (0.09 and 0.11\u00a0in) wide. The carapace, the hard upper part of the cephalothorax, is dark brown with a lighter streak down the middle and covered in dense brown hairs. The eye field is blackish with white scales, small white spots and long brown bristles around the eyes themselves. The underside, or sternum, is yellow. The spider's mouthparts, including its labium and maxillae, are brown. The chelicerae have a single tooth.\nThe spider's abdomen is between 3 and 3.5\u00a0mm (0.12 and 0.14\u00a0in) long and 2.2 and 2.6\u00a0mm (0.09 and 0.10\u00a0in) wide. It is greyish-brown on top, which is darker to the edges, with a pattern of six white spots in two lines. It is covered in dense brown hairs and occasional long brown bristles. The underside is yellow with a large dark grey spot to the back. The spinnerets are mainly grey with yellow areas to the rear. The spider's legs are light brown with darker markings. They are covered in brown hairs and spines.\nThe spider's copulatory organs help to distinguish the species from others in the genus. The epigyne have deep pockets at the front and two copulatory openings placed at its edges. There are areas of sclerotization on the depressions. The openings lead to short insemination ducts and bean-shaped spermathecae, or receptacles. Its epigyne is very similar to the related Evarcha pinguis, including its internal structure. but differ in the shape of the depressions in the spider's epigyne. The male has not been described.\nDistribution and habitat\nEvarcha spiders live across the world, although those found in North America may be accidental migrants. Although the genus is found across Africa, Evarcha zougoussi is endemic to Ivory Coast. The female holotype was found in near the village of Zougoussi. The village is situated in the Lamto study area, which is about 180\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi) north of Abidjan at the edge of the savanna. The spider lives in the savanna amongst tall grass.\n",

    "Mexican Catholic charity organisation.\nCaritas Mexico (Spanish: C\u00e1ritas Mexicana) is a Mexican nonprofit organisation. It is the official aid organisation of the Catholic Church in Mexico.\nThe organisation is a member of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation and of Caritas Latin America and Caribbean.\nBackground\nIn 1971, Pope Paul VI established the Pontifical Council Cor Unum. Its goal was the coordination, promotion and intensification of the Catholic relief and assistance activities and organizations. One of the two members of the council was Adalberto Almeida y Merino, Archbishop of Chihuahua. He returned home to convince the Episcopal Conference of Mexico to create a national Caritas in Mexico, which was achieved in 1973.\nThe original purpose of Caritas Mexico was to serve as the federation of the Mexican diocesan Caritas organisations, as most Catholic dioceses had established their own Caritas. However, between 1979 and 1995, Caritas Mexico mainly provided emergency relief and social assistance. In 1997, its legal status changed and it became an Instituci\u00f3n de Asistencia Privada (Private Assistance Institution). This allowed it to restore its original purpose as federation. In 2024, there were 62 diocesan Caritas branches operating in 30 Mexican states.\nStructure\nCaritas Mexico consists of dozens of regional, independent Caritas organisations in Mexico, one in each of the Catholic dioceses of Mexico. They implement social projects locally. \nThe diocesan organisations are:\nC\u00e1ritas Mexicana IAP\nC\u00e1ritas Aguascalientes AC\nC\u00e1ritas Arquidi\u00f3cesis de M\u00e9xico IAP\nC\u00e1ritas de Monterrey ABP\nC\u00e1ritas de Quer\u00e9taro IAP\nC\u00e1ritas de Guadalajara AC\nC\u00e1ritas Lomita IAP (Culiac\u00e1n)\nCaritas Mazatl\u00e1n IAP\nC\u00e1ritas de Baja California Sur AC (La Paz)\nC\u00e1ritas Diocesana Morelia IAP\nC\u00e1ritas de Chihuahua IBP\nCentro de Estudios y Promoci\u00f3n Social C\u00e1ritas AC (San Lu\u00eds Potos\u00ed)\nC\u00e1ritas de Tabasco AC\nC\u00e1ritas de Quintana Roo AC\nCaritas de Yucat\u00e1n AC\nC\u00e1ritas de San Juan de los Lagos AC\nC\u00e1ritas de Le\u00f3n AC\nC\u00e1ritas de San Cristobal de las Casas AC\nC\u00e1ritas de la Arquidi\u00f3cesis de Acapulco AC\nC\u00e1ritas de Saltillo AC\nFundaci\u00f3n de Beneficencia Privada C\u00e1ritas de Puebla IBP\nC\u00e1ritas de Nuevo Laredo AC\nC\u00e1ritas Colima IAP\nC\u00e1ritas Diocesano de Piedras Negras AC\nC\u00e1ritas Hidalgo AC (Tula)\nC\u00e1ritas Tulancingo AC\nC\u00e1ritas de Huajuapan de Le\u00f3n AC\nC\u00e1ritas de la Di\u00f3cesis de Ecatepec IAP\nC\u00e1ritas de la Di\u00f3cesis de Tenancingo IAP\nC\u00e1ritas de Tampico AC\nC\u00e1ritas de la Arquidi\u00f3cesis de Tlalnepantla IAP\nC\u00e1ritas Parral AC\nC\u00e1ritas Diocesanas de Torre\u00f3n AC\nC\u00e1ritas de Ciudad Victoria AC\nC\u00e1ritas Xalapa\nC\u00e1ritas Tehuac\u00e1n AC\nC\u00e1ritas de Cordoba AC\nC\u00e1ritas Di\u00f3cesis de San Andr\u00e9s Tuxtla AC\nC\u00e1ritas de la Sagrada Familia de Gomez Palacio Durango AC\nCaridad Pastoral Social AC (Matamoros)\nC\u00e1ritas Regi\u00f3n Mexicali AC\nC\u00e1ritas Region Siderurgica A.C.\nCaritas de Zamora AC\nC\u00e1ritas Morelos AC\nC\u00e1ritas de Tuxpan AC\nC\u00e1ritas de Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez AC\nCaritas Regi\u00f3n Noroeste AC (Tijuana)\nC\u00e1ritas Veracruz\nC\u00e1ritas Zacatecas\nC\u00e1ritas K\u00f3rima IASP (Tarahumara)\nC\u00e1ritas Toluca\nC\u00e1ritas Texcoco\nCentro asistencial y de promoci\u00f3n humana AC (Celaya)\nC\u00e1ritas Di\u00f3cesis de Irapuato AC\nC\u00e1ritas diocesana de Antequera Oaxaca\nC\u00e1ritas de Autl\u00e1n AC\nC\u00e1ritas Diocesana de Coatzacoalcos\nC\u00e1ritas Nezahualc\u00f3yotl\nC\u00e1ritas Hermosillo\nC\u00e1ritas de CD Ju\u00e1rez\nC\u00e1ritas Campeche\nC\u00e1ritas Tlaxcala\nC\u00e1ritas Nuevo Casas Grandes\nC\u00e1ritas Tepic\nC\u00e1ritas de San Agust\u00edn Tapachula\nC\u00e1ritas Tlapa\nC\u00e1ritas Teotihuac\u00e1n\nC\u00e1ritas Tehuantepec\nC\u00e1ritas de Apatzing\u00e1n\u00a0\nC\u00e1ritas L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas\nC\u00e1ritas CD Valles\nC\u00e1ritas CD Altamirano\nC\u00e1ritas del Guadiana\nC\u00e1ritas Huejutla\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in Spanish)\n",
    "\nCeratioidei, the deep-sea anglerfishes or pelagic anglerfishes, is a suborder of marine ray-finned fishes, one of four suborders in the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes. These fishes are found in tropical and temperate seas throughout the world. One of the better known traits of the deep-sea anglerfishes is their extreme sexual dimorphism where the males are many times smaller than the females, the males seek out females and use their sharp teeth to clamp onto the females where he remains for the rest of his life, in some species he becomes part of the female. This is the only known natural example of a process called parabiosis. Another common trait of deep-sea anglerfishes is that they use bioluminescence on their esca to attract prey in the darkness of the deep oceans they inhabit.\nTaxonomy\nCeratioidei was first proposed as a grouping in 1912 by the English ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan as the division Ceratiformes within the suborder Lophoidea of the order Pediculati, which included the Batrachoididae. The Batrachoididae are not now cosidered to be closely related to the anglerfishes which are now included in the order Lophiiformes. Ceratioidei are in the same clade as the Chaunacoidei with the Antennarioidei and the Ogcocephaloidei as the sisters of that clade. The 5th edition of Fishes of the World treats this grouping as a suborder within the Lophiiformes.\nEtymology\nCeratioidei takes its name from the genus Ceratias, the type genus of the family Ceratidae and of the suborder. Ceratias means \"horn bearer\", an allusion to the esca sticking up from the snout.\nFamilies\nRepresentatives of ceratioid families:1. (A) Centrophrynidae: Centrophryne spinulosa; (B) Ceratiidae: Cryptopsaras couesii; (C) Himantolophidae: Himantolophus appelii; (D) Diceratiidae: Diceratias trilobus; (E) Diceratiidae: Bufoceratias wedli; (F) Diceratiidae: Bufoceratias shaoi; (G) Melanocetidae: Melanocetus eustalus; (H) Thaumatichthyidae: Lasiognathus amphirhamphus; (I) Thaumatichthyidae: Thaumatichthys binghami; (J) Oneirodidae: Chaenophryne quasiramifera.\nCeratioidei contains the following families:\nCaulophrynidae Goode & Bean, 1896 (Fanfins)\nNeoceratiidae Regan, 1926 (Spiny seadevils)\nMelanocetidae Gill, 1878 (Black seadevils)\nHimantolophidae Gill, 1861 (Footballfishes)\nDiceratiidae Regan & Trewavas, 1932 (Double anglers)\nOneirodidae Gill, 1878 (Dreamers)\nThaumatichthyidae Smith & Radcliffe, 1912 (Wolftrap anglers)\nCentrophrynidae Bertelsen, 1951 (Prickly seadevils)\nCeratiidae Gill, 1861 (Warty seadevils)\nGigantactinidae Boulenger, 1904 (Whipnose anglers)\nLinophrynidae Regan, 1925 (Leftvents)\n",
    "East German glass\nBranded Superfest glass\nSuperfest, also called CV-Glas\u00a0or Ceverit\u00a0until 1980, was a brand of drinking glasses in the GDR. Due to being made of chemically strengthened glass, they were almost unbreakable. The Superfest glasses were produced between 1980 and 1990 in what was then state-owned Sachsenglas Schwepnitz.\nHistory\nIn the mid-1970s, attempts began in the GDR to make conventional thin-walled commercial glass stronger and more heat-resistant. The Glass Structure Research Department, founded in 1973 by the Central Institute for Organic Chemistry, investigated ion exchange. In an additional processing step, smaller sodium ions on the surface of the glass are replaced by larger potassium ions, which increases the tension in the glass surface, making it stronger. This technique is also used to make Gorilla Glass.\nOn August 8, 1977, a four-person team led by the scientist Dieter Patzig registered patent number 157966 Method and device for solidifying glass products by ion exchange for solidified drinking glass. In November 1978, a Council of Ministers decision secured the financing of this \u201cproject of particular urgency\u201d. The glass brand resulting from the invention was called CEVERIT, composed of CE (chemical) + VER (solidified) + IT (usual ending for mineral substances). The aim was to have five times\u00a0the lifespan of an ordinary drinking glass, but fifteen times lifespan was achieved. Other advantages included heat resistance, stackability, and lower weight.\nThe scientists had a small team of assistants who helped perfect the material every day. Elfriede Hilma Matzko, a trained metallographer, worked on Dieter Patzig's team as a physical assistant. For several years, she measured cracks in the glass every day, forwarded evaluations to the scientists, and thus contributed to improving the strength of the glass. The scientists and their team of assistants from the GDR Academy of Sciences (AdW) received an honor and a cash reward for their innovation. This bonus was paid to only full-time employees and not to part-time employees. Elfriede Hilma Matzko, mother of four children, therefore received no bonus as a part-time worker.\nProduction began in spring 1980 at Sachsenglas Schwepnitz and was initially limited to beer glasses. At the suggestion of the West German sales representative Eberhard Pook, the name of the brand was changed to Superfest. The total daily energy consumption of the system, which was designed for a throughput of up to 48,000 quarter-liter jars per day, was between 250 and 350 kWh. By the end of production on July 1, 1990, 110 to 120 million super-strength drinking glasses in all sizes were manufactured. The main customer was the GDR gastronomy. The intended sale in the Federal Republic did not take place. \u201cWith Coca Cola, for example, they said: Why should we use a glass that doesn't break? We make money with our glasses.  The dealers said understandably: Who would saw off the branch he was sitting on?\u201d (Eberhard Pook)Shot glasses, vases, ice cream cups, and other shapes were later added to the range.\nWith the political change, the GDR glass industry and its scientific institutions began to be wound down. In July 1990, the Schwepnitz glassworks became SAXONIA-Glas GmbH Schwepnitz, which was liquidated by the Treuhand in 1991. In April 1992, the patent was abandoned by the inventors.\nLegacy\nThe technology developed for Superfest glass has been recognized as a milestone in the field of glass science and engineering. Today, the glass is highly collectible and sought after by enthusiasts and dealers due to its rarity and historical significance.\n",
    "\nThe Miner's Trust is a 1908 Australian play by Jo Smith. It was Smith's first play and very successful. The play was rare for Australian plays at the time in that it was an original for the stage, not an adaptation of a novel or historical event.\nThe play was produced and directed by John Gunn, a leading theatre manager of the time. He said \"I have read many and good Australian manuscripts, but this is far and away the best I have been privileged to glance through.\"\nReception\nReviews were generally strong. '\nEvening Sun said \"Few imported dramas of the kind, it is said, have the absorbingly interesting plot that characterises A Miner's Trust which, moreover, is not written in the hysterical key common to most melodramas.\"\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said it \"possesses a higher standard of literary excellence and dramatic construction than much of the similar work of English playwrights.\"\nThe Daily Telegraph said \"The piece is straight-out melodrama, the central idea is as preposterous as usual, and conventionalities are well preserved. Mr. Smith, however, having got the idea, sticks to it with praiseworthy determination, and allows no side-stepping, but bustles the story along to the inevitable end with considerable ingenuity and well-contrived dramatic effects.\"\nPremise\nTwo Englishmen, John Howard and Alan Trengrove, have been prospecting in Red Hills, Victoria. They strike a rich claim, then return to Melbourne. On the way, John is shot and killed by a French bushranger, an escapee from New Caldeonia. Alan decides to impersonate John to marry John's blind fianc\u00e9e, Alice Medway, and say that Alan was murdered. Alan then discovers he has inherited a fortune from an uncle in America but this has gone to his villainous cousin Arthur, as they think \"Alan\" is dead. Alan also falls in love with Ida Medway. Alan hears of a shipwreck and helps rescues the passengers, who include the French bushranger, returning home to France. The bushranger recognises Alan which makes Arthur suspicious. Alan confesses his deception to Ida's father, which is overheard by Alice. Alice gives up her claim to \"John\" (Alan). Arthur loses his fortune. The French bushranger is arrested.\n",
    "Portuguese politician and architect (born 1952)\nMargarida Maria de Moura Alves da Silva de Almeida Saavedra (born 1952) is a Portuguese architect who, in the March 2024 election, was elected to be a deputy in the 16th Legislature of the Third Portuguese Republic. She is a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and was elected to represent the Lisbon constituency.\nCareer\nSaavedra was born on 22 October 1952. She obtained university qualifications as an architect and in 1979 joined the Lisbon City Council as a result of a public examination. She has worked with the city council on urban management since that time, being with the Empresa P\u00fablica de Urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o de Lisboa (Lisbon Urbanization Public Company) since 2010. She has said that when she served as director of urban management, she succeeded in reducing a backlog of planning cases from 12,000 to nil in two years. A former councillor on Lisbon City Council, she was also writing regular opinion pieces for the newspaper, P\u00fablico.\nPolitical career\nIn the 2024 national election, called early after the resignation of prime minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa following allegations of corruption by members of his Socialist Party (PS) government, the PSD formed an alliance with two smaller parties, known as the Democratic Alliance (AD). Saavedra was eighth on the AD list of candidates for the Lisbon district and was elected when the AD won 13 of the 48 seats available in the constituency. In the parliament she became a member of the Economy, Public Works, and Housing Committee.\nControversy\nOn 18 April 2024 a request was made by a judge for the waiving of parliamentary immunity of Saavedra and two other PSD deputies, Lu\u00eds Newton and Carlos Eduardo Reis, as part of an investigation into an alleged conspiracy on the part of PSD and PS members from 2016 to allocate political places in the parishes and municipalities of the Lisbon district. Saavedra was under investigation for \"qualified fraud\". According to the law, those elected to Parliament cannot be defendants without authorization from the Assembly of the Republic, which is mandatory when there is strong evidence of committing an intentional crime that carries a prison sentence whose limit maximum is more than 3 years.\n",

The Battalion played an important role in the history of some people, preventing the pacification and massacre of villages and becoming one of the most famous battalions in the district\nHistory\nZamo\u015b\u0107 Uprising\nIn the same area, in the south of the district, where the battalion of District 5 South, commanded by Stefan Kwa\u015bniewski \"Wiktor\", operated, there was a BCh battalion, under the command of Stanis\u0142aw Basaj \"Rys\".The history of this battalion has a relatively rich literature. It is mentioned in the publication \"\u0179r\u00f3d\u0142a i materia\u0142y do dziej\u00f3w Ruchu Oporu na Lubelszczy\u017anie\" in volume two \"Bataliony Ch\u0142opskie na Lubelszczy\u017anie\".and volume five \"Kalendarium walki Batalion\u00f3w Ch\u0142opskich na Lubelszczy\u017anie\".

On 28 November 1942, a great displacement action began, the brutality and bestiality of which were unprecedented in the history of Europe; villages were surrounded at night, the entire population was herded to a selected square, often murdering the infirm and resistant; the population was also segregated; Children were detached and sent to resettlement or concentration camps in the interior of the country or to concentration camps, while \"racially pure\" children were sent to be Germanised; as the action took place in late autumn and winter, trains full of frozen corpses of children circulated in the country.\nRy\u015b battalion\nGerman colonists from almost the whole of Europe \u2013 from the Reich, Bessarabia, Romania, Slovenia and the USSR \u2013 were brought to replace the displaced Poles; a special policy was applied to local Ukrainians (\"Ukraineraktion\"), settling them on the shores of the settlement belt to protect the Germans from attacks by the Polish underground.\nIn the spring of 1942, a small operational group was formed in the village of Ma\u0142k\u00f3w in the Hrubiesz\u00f3w district, headed by Stanis\u0142aw Basaj \"Ry\u015b\". \nBattalion was Formed and his First battles\nThis group grew rapidly in numbers and in July 1943 formed a battalion headed by the so-called 'Headquarters'.

Battalion fought at Zamo\u015b\u0107 Uprising\nIn late autumn, Stanislaw Basaj's troops were quartered and gathering strength for further battles, but this calm was disturbed by the 14th SS Grenadier Division in the strength of 2 companies. They attacked the villages of G\u00f3rka-Zab\u0142ocie and Ma\u0142k\u00f3w, where Stanislaw Basaj's forces and the Home army were stationed, and easily dealt with the attack, The next day Ry\u015b struck at the same forces that had attacked him, the Ukrainian forces were at a disadvantage, inflicting heavy losses on them, thus preventing the pacification of Malkov, but on 14 February probably 140 soldiers of the Ry\u015b battalion and the Home Army fought a battle with German forces near Zab\u0142ocie, the day-long battle ended in a Polish victory and inflicting colossal losses on the Germans, thanks to which the Basaj's troops captured ammunition and weapons from the Germans. On 27 February, there was another skirmish near Malkov, where the battalion claimed victory over the SS Beyersdorf Battle Group and the Ukrainian National Self-Defence. Sparing the Polish population, they bravely attacked another detachment of the 14th Division's Granadiers and police; the Ukrainians were beaten in the villages of G\u00f3rna and \u0141a",
    "Political party in India, 1983\u20131988\nRashtriya Sanjay Manch (RSM) was a political party founded by Maneka Gandhi, the widow of Indian politician Sanjay Gandhi and estranged daughter-in-law of then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, on April 3, 1983. The party was established along with Akbar Ahmad Dumpy, with a focus on youth empowerment and employment. RSM was launched with a grand inaugural convention at Feroze Shah Kotla grounds in New Delhi, which was attended by around 5,000 delegates from across the country. In 1988, the Rashtriya Sanjay Manch was merged with the Janata Dal, which was the main opposition party at that time.\nHistory\nManeka Gandhi had previously been associated with the Congress(I) party. However, after a fallout with her mother-in-law and PM Indira Gandhi, she was forced to leave the prime minister's residence at 1, Safdarjung Road. After that, Maneka Gandhi established Rashtriya Sanjay Manch, which aimed to provide a platform for her political aspirations and address the youth's concerns. The party was based on the ideology of Sanjay Gandhi.\nManeka Gandhi was the founder of the Rashtriya Sanjay Manch, which she named after her husband, Sanjay Gandhi.\nBefore the party's launch, Maneka had already established an organization known as the Sanjay Vichar Manch (SVM), which later transformed into the youth wing of the Rashtriya Sanjay Manch.\nManeka Gandhi was the face of the party and had a significant following. She claimed that the party had 800,000 members. Her political career took a turn when she contested the 1984 general election against Rajiv Gandhi for the Amethi Lok Sabha constituency but lost.\nAs of April 1983, the party had two Members of Parliament, including former deputy finance minister Maganbhai Barot, along with two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) from Uttar Pradesh, one MLA from Bihar, and four MLAs from Andhra Pradesh.\nIn the 1984 Malihabad assembly by-election, Brij Lal, a gram pradhan from Amethi and candidate of RSM, won against Shanti Kureel of the Congress(I) by over 7,400 votes. This victory made other political parties acknowledge growing influence of Rashtriya Sanjay Manch.\nIn 1987, the RSM candidate Akbar Ahmad Dumpy, with support from the Janata Party and the Lok Dal won the assembly election in the Kashipur  against the Congress(I) candidate and the state's Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Ammar Rizvi.\n1983 Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh\nIn the 1983 assembly election, the party formed an alliance with the Telugu Desam Party and secured victory in four out of the five seats it contested. Meanwhile, the Telugu Desam Party, its ally, won 199 seats. It was the first time in Andhra Pradesh's history that a non-Congress party was voted to power.\nControversies and criticism of Indira Gandhi\nIn September 1982, three individuals closely associated with Maneka, including Vice President of Rashtriya Sanjay Manch, Akbar Ahmad Dumpy, were arrested on charges related to the death of a servant. The court promptly dismissed the case. The media frenzy over the incident fueled public suspicion of PM Indira Gandhi suppressing Maneka's group. It also heightened criticism of Indira's leadership, with accusations of authoritarianism and cronyism.\nLater, Dumpy, who was a co-accused in the case of the killing of the servant, was acquitted by a special court in November 2022.\nSee also\nList of political parties in India\n",
    "American politician\nCharles Vernon Lisle (October 1, 1906 \u2013 April 29, 1982) was an American politician.\nEarly life and career\nVern Lisle was born in Clarinda, Iowa, on October 1, 1906, to parents Edwin Lisle Sr. and Edith Crane. He had four siblings, three sisters and a brother. Lisle was educated in his hometown, attended the University of Iowa from 1923 to 1926, then transferred to the University of Michigan, where he graduated in 1928 with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering. He then took over the leadership of family-owned manufacturing company Lisle Corporation from his father in 1936, serving as president until 1970, when he was replaced by his brother.\nPolitical career\nLisle was elected to three terms on the Clarinda school board in the 1940s, overlapping with the start of his tenure on the Iowa House of Representatives. In total, Lisle was elected to seven consecutive terms from House District 9, and served continuously from January 10, 1949, to January 13, 1963. Between January 12, 1959, and January 8, 1961, Lisle was speaker of the state house. For the 1962 Iowa Senate election, District 6 was expanded to a multi-member district, and Lisle was elected to serve alongside incumbent senator Orval C. Walter. In 1964, District 6 reverted to a single-member district, represented solely by Lisle. Lisle won a second four-year term in 1966, but left office on October 17, 1969, necessitating a special election, won by Earl Bass.\nDuring his legislature career, Lisle was an advocate of education and community colleges. During his first legislative term, Lisle helped advance a bill on presidential primary balloting through the Iowa General Assembly. He was considered the favorite for the house speakership prior to the 58th Iowa General Assembly. After his election to the role, Lisle announced the establishment of three special committees on highway safety, reapportionment, and state planning and development. During his speakership, Lisle opposed a 1959 bill permitting dove shooting. That same year, a session of the 58th General Assembly became the first in Iowa history to cost over $1 million. In 1963, Lisle worked alongside colleagues Jack Schroeder and Howard C. Buck to review fair employment legislation.\nDeath\nLisle died on April 29, 1982, in Atlantic, Iowa.\n",

    "Indian criminal lawyer and actor (born 1947)\nMiguel Transfigura\u00e7a\u00f5 de Cristo \"Michael\" Rodrigues (born 6 August 1947), known professionally as Mike Mehta, is an Indian former advocate, criminal lawyer, actor, playwright, and theatre director known for his work in Hindi, Konkani films, television, and tiatr productions. He provided legal counsel to two Goan politicians, Francisco Monte Cruz and Churchill Alemao, who served as ministers and represented the Benaulim Assembly constituency in the state of Goa.\nEarly life\nMiguel Transfigura\u00e7a\u00f5 de Cristo Rodrigues was born on 6 August 1947, in Borim, Goa, which was a part of Portuguese India during the era of the Portuguese Empire. He was born into a Goan Catholic family, with his father being Jos\u00e9 Pascoal Rodrigues and his mother being Cristalina Dias, a homemaker, also known as Cristalina Luis. Rodrigues showcased his talents during his school years by actively participating in English-language concerts and theatrical productions. His proficiency in English and his strong, powerful voice propelled him towards a career as a professional compere, showcasing his talents in hosting events and engaging audiences. Rodrigues gained recognition for his role as a host for various events including weddings, social gatherings, public assemblies, and musical performances. Despite his achievements in this field, Rodrigues experienced a sense of discontentment and yearned for greater fulfillment in his work. In his quest for artistic satisfaction, he immersed himself in the local tiatr scene, regularly attending performances and closely observing the skills and techniques employed by accomplished tiatrists.\nRodrigues achieved recognition performing under the pseudonym Mike Mehta during his participation in English concert showcases. He received his formal education at notable institutions, including St. Michael's High School in Mahim, Bombay, followed by St. Aloysius High School in Bandra and Guardian Angel High School in Sanvordem, Goa. Continuing his academic pursuits, Rodrigues pursued higher education at Parvatibai Chowgule College in Goa and Kirti M. Doongursee College in Dadar. His educational endeavors culminated in the attainment of a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Bombay. During his educational journey from school to college, Rodrigues actively engaged in a variety of English concerts, occasionally expanding his repertoire to include performances in Hindi as well. Despite his proficiency in the Konkani language, he did not have the opportunity to showcase his talents in Konkani concerts, even during his tenure at Guardian Angel High School and Chowgule College in Goa.\nCareer\nRodrigues was a playwright and performer whose socio-political plays, such as Grant Road, Goenkaranchem Rogot (Goans' Blood), and Goem Viklem Ghanttar, hold a significant place in Konkani theatrical history. In his later years, Rodrigues's affection for the Konkani language inspired him to engage in the creation, direction, and acting in tiatrs, which are traditional Konkani musical dramas. Throughout his career, Rodrigues pondered the question of why Bengali literary figure Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his Bengali work Gitanjali, while Konkani writers had not received similar recognition. This contemplation became a driving force behind Rodrigues's decision to explore complex and challenging subjects in his Konkani tiatrs, believing that dedication and sincerity could lead to comparable achievements. However, despite his commitment, Rodrigues has yet to receive any awards for his work, resulting in his relative anonymity as a tiatrist, as noted by writer Fausto V. Da Costa. Rodrigues has made a significant impact on the heritage of Konkani tiatr. Over a period of 35 years, he engaged in more than 550 theater performances, demonstrating his proficiency and experience. Furthermore, Rodrigues holds educational achievements in theater and screenplay composition, enhancing his standing in the field. It was Rosario Dias who first introduced Rodrigues to the tiatr stage, casting him in the production Vivasghat (Betrayal).\nIn 1980, Rodrigues gained acclaim for his role in the successful Konkani play titled Purtugez Kolvont (Portuguese Artist), written by Konkani playwright John Claro. This play achieved a significant milestone by staging over 200 performances in locations such as Goa, Bombay, and Poona. Subsequently, Rodrigues was cast in another play by Claro called Inglez Madam (English Madam). Throughout his career, Rodrigues collaborated with popular Konkani directors in the tiatr stage, including M. Boyer, C. Alvares, Jacinto Vaz, Remmie Cola\u00e7o, Kamat de Assolna, Premanand Sangodkar, Anil Kumar, Fr. Planton Faria, and others. Rodrigues, known for his adherence to the acting principles of \"Konstantin Stanislavski's\" school of acting, showcased his versatility as a writer, director, and producer, contrib",
    "\nBuilding in Heslington, York\nThe Deramore Arms is a pub in Heslington, York, England.\nHistory\nThere were three alehouses in Heslington, but by 1823 there were only two. At this time the pub was called The Ship. In 1840, it was called The Fox. By 1872 it was called The Yarburgh Arms, which in 1967 was updated to The Deramore Arms.\nDuring the Second World War, the pub was popular with Royal Air Force Bomber Command personnel stationed near by. On some occasions, the personnel held races between the Charles and the Deramore on top of a stuffed rhinoceros.\nWhen the University of York opened in 1963, the pub proved popular with students. It was initially the haunt of athletic students. In more recent years, the Deramore has been seen as the 'local' pub, while the Charles caters to the students, although there is considerable crossover between them. The popularity with sports teams university sports teams has remained, with Heslington Parish Council celebrating it as the traditional location for the teams to congregate after matches, and for their pub crawls to begin from. The pub has also proved to be a popular location for attendees of conferences at the university, and an important location for academics at the university to develop their work.\nThe pub has seen friction between students and locals. An attempt by The Spirit Group, the then owner of the pub, to extend opening hours in 2005 was successfully challenged by the local community.\nThe pub was the site of the sort-lived Four Thorns Brewery, but this turned out to be unsustainable.\nThe pub closed in August 2016 when the licensees claimed that it was financially inviable to remain open. It then reopened in May 2017.\nIn recognition of the pubs value to the local community, in 2017 Heslington Parish Council got it listed as an Asset of Community Value by City of York Council.\nIn November 2023 the pub again had to close. It reopened shortly after Christmas, securing Shaun Wallace for one of their regular quizzes in May 2024.\nOrigin of name\nThe pub is named after the last family to live in Heslington Hall, the village's county manor. The Deramore baronetcy had a close connection with the village, but after selling the hall in 1956 they ceased to be as core a part of the local community. The family name of 'de Yarburgh-Bateson' was the origin of the precursor name of 'The Yarburgh Arms', but in 1967 the name was change to instead the family title.\n",
    "Theatre in Richmond, Virginia\nInterior of the New Richmond Theatre from c. 1890. Photograph by Edyth Carter Beveridge.\nThe Richmond Theatre was the name of four theatres located in Richmond, Virginia. The first theatre was originally established in 1786 as the Academy of Fine Arts and Sciences of the United States or Quesney's Academy. It was renamed the Richmond Theatre after it came under the management of Thomas Wade West and John Bignall. It was destroyed by fire in 1798. The second Richmond Theatre opened in 1806 on the same site and was destroyed by fire in 1811. The 1811 Richmond Theatre fire is considered a significant disaster in the history of the city, and was described by historian Meredith Henne Baker as \"early America's first great disaster\".\nThe third Richmond Theatre opened in 1819 on a different site. After being remodeled in 1838, the theatre re-opened as the Marshall Theatre. It too was destroyed by fire in 1862. The Marshall Theatre was rebuilt on the same foundation and re-opened in 1863. It was originally called the New Marshall Theatre during construction, but was ultimately branded the New Richmond Theatre soon after it opened. By the time this fourth and final structure was demolished in 1896 it was known as the Richmond Theater. The various theatres known as the Richmond and Marshall theatres, were the leading performance venues in Richmond for the majority of the 19th century.\nFirst Richmond Theatre, originally Quesnay's Academy  (1786-1798)\nC. 1797-1798 Drawing of the first Richmond Theatre by Benjamin Henry Latrobe.\nThe first Richmond Theatre was originally intended to be not only a theatre, but a school, museum, and art gallery housed collectively under the name of the Academy of Fine Arts and Sciences of the United States. The idea for this organization originated with the French scholar and soldier Chevalier Alexandre-Marie Quesnay de Beaurepaire who had come to the United States in March 1777 to fight in the American Revolutionary War. Quesnay intended to create an American organization modeled after the French Academy of Sciences (also known as the  National Institute of Sciences and Arts).\nAfter nearly a decade of advocacy by Quesnay, a three and a quarter acre plot of land was purchased for 300 pounds from John Turpin on May 20, 1786, through funds raised through subscription to Quesnay's Academy. This land was located at the brow of Shockoe Hill. At the time, the main road on Shockoe Hill did not extend to the property, and as part of the land sale agreement, Turpin paid for the extension of the road and the creation of Academy Square where Quesnay's Academy was to be constructed. The cornerstone of the building was laid by Richmond's Masonic Lodge No. 13 on June 24, 1786. The building's cornerstone was placed at the Northeast corner of the building. The front of the building was situated on what is now 12th street,  and was located at what is now the intersection of 12th and Broad just north of Capitol Square. The academy was built with a \"barn-like wooden structure\".\n1780s theatre ticket by the Old American Company.\nQuesnay's Academy (QA) opened on October 10, 1786, in a performance given by the Old American Company of Comedians under the management of Lewis Hallam Jr. and John Henry. Sources vary as to which work was performed on this date, with some sources claiming it was the opera  Poor Soldier and others the play School for Scandal. Regardless, sources agree that the repertoire of Hallam and Henry's season in Richmond included the stage works Poor Soldier, School for Scandal, and Alexander the Great\u00a0; or , the Rival Queens.\nQuesnay's dream of an institution mirroring that of the French Academy of Sciences was short lived. Social prejudices against the morality of the theatre made operations of such an institution challenging, and he was forced to publicly make it clear that there was separation between the scholars studying at the QA and the visiting theatre troupes utilizing the QA's theatre. Quesney himself taught dance classes at the academy, but by December 1887 Quesney's Academy ceased operation.\n1798 Drawing of the green room of the first Richmond Theatre by Latrobe.\nTheatre managers Thomas Wade West and John Bignall took over the QA, and made significant alterations to the QA and its theatre.  It was renamed the Richmond Theatre, and at this time Academy Square became known as Theatre Square. West and Bignall continued to operate the theatre until it was destroyed by fire on 23 January 1798.\nThe Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788 was held in this building beginning on June 2 for three weeks after having begun the convention previously at a structure at Cary and fourteenth streets that was temporarily serving as Virginia's capitol building.  Among the many individuals in attendance were James Madison, John Marshall, James Monroe, Edmund Pendleton, George Wythe, George Nicholas, Edmund Randolph, George Mason, Richard Henry Lee, and Patrick Henry.\nSecond Ri",
    "2024 video game\n33 Immortals is an upcoming action roguelike video game developed and published by Thunder Lotus Games. The game is set to be released for Windows PC and Xbox Series X and Series S through early access in 2024.\nGameplay\n33 Immortals is an action video game played from a top-down perspective. In the game, the player assumes control of a damned soul who must fight through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven as they rebel against a cruel God who banishes them. The game supports 33-player cooperative multiplayer, and each gameplay session, which lasts around 25 minutes, is comparable to raid missions from massively multiplayer online games (MMO).\nPlayers start each session in the \"Dark Forest\", a hub world in which players can select their character archetypes (melee, ranged, support, or tank) before venturing through the Eternal Gate into the battlefield. Players are initially split into teams of six as they explore the map and completes Torture Chambers (described by the team as mini-dungeons). Once a chamber is completed, players will unlock Relics and trigger God's wrath, which causes the entire map to be engulfed in fire. The remaining surviving players are then split into three teams, with each team having one chance to complete \"Ascension Battles\", which unlock Legendary Relics that provide global bonuses to the entire team. The session will then culminate with a boss fight. Enemies placement, gameplay challenges and rewards in each session are randomly generated. The players are then returned to the Dark Forest in which they can change their loadout, discuss with non-playable characters to unlock new weapons, relics and poetic perks, which typically provide stat advantages.\nPlayers can freely customize their playable avatar with various cosmetic items. The game features 14 different weapons inspired by the seven deadly sins and the seven heavenly virtues, and players must collaborate with each other to unleash \"co-op powers\", which are powerful moves that can inflict a large amount of devastating damage to enemies. If a player is defeated, other players can revive them within a set period, though the game has a set difficulty, meaning that players are more likely to complete their objectives and defeat the bosses successfully if all of their teammates survive.\nDevelopment\n33 Immortals is currently being developed by Thunder Lotus Games, the studio behind Spiritfarer. The setting of the game was inspired by The Divine Comedy, with Dante, Beatrice, Virgil, and Charon all appearing in the game as supporting characters, though their backgrounds were reworked to meet modern values. For instance, Beatrice was reimagined from a guide in Purgatory to the \"leader of the rebellion\", and Virgil becomes a female scholar who is interested in \"science, moral values, and the use of weapons\".\n33 Immortals is Thunder Lotus' first online video game. To meet the challenges of developing an online game, the studio expanded into two parallel development team, and recruited personnel with prior experience working on a multiplayer project. While preparing extensively is essential for players to succeed in raid missions in other MMO games, 33 Immortals was described by the team as a \"pick up and raid\" experience, as the game streamlines the mission process and allows players to jump into action \"as quick and seamless as possible\". While the team initially experimented with having 100 players in a gameplay session, the maximum player count was reduced to 33. According to the team, 33 was chosen because each part of The Divine Comedy has 33 chapters.\nThunder Lotus announced 33 Immortals in June 2023 at the Xbox Games Showcase. The game is set to be released via early access in 2024 for Windows PC and Xbox Series X and Series S.\n",
    "The 1998 Danish general strike was a general strike in Denmark in the spring of 1998 involving around 500 000 workers, around 10% of the Danish population.\nBackground\nIn early 1998, members of the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) agreed on a \"three sixes\" programme, aiming to secure six weeks of paid vacation each year, a six-hour hour working day, and a 6% pay raise.\nStrike\nIn April 1998, the LO and the Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening announced a new two-year collective bargaining agreement that included only a single extra day of paid vacation per year. When the LO put the agreement to a vote of its members, 55% of the workers voted against it. Subsequently, on the 27th of April, the workers walked out on strike.\nOn 6 May, Danish Prime Minister and leader of the Social Democrats Poul Nyrup Rasmussen stated that the strike was \"irresponsible\" and announced measures to end the strike. The measures ordered workers to end the strike by the 11th of May, made it illegal for the same workers to go on strike again within the next two years, and reduced the amount companies had to pay towards employee pensions. The measures also included two extra paid vacations days for workers who had worked for at least nine months at their workplace as well as two additional days of discounted childcare to workers who had spent at least six months at their workplace. The unions accepted the measures without a members' vote, and the strike came to an end.\nAssessement\nMargaret Slusher of Swarthmore College's Global Nonviolent Action Database assessed the gains won by the workers as \"very small.\" Sam Lowry of libcom.org stated that the strike \"left workers demands largely unmet.\"\nThe European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions described the strike as \"the key event in Danish industrial relations in 1998,\" attributing the strike to the Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening beginning to break away from the traditional Danish cycle of collective bargaining, motivated by a fear of increased economic competition in a growing economy, whereas the workers expected higher increase in wages and benefits from the economic growth. Some commentators believed the government had acted to try and ensure a \"Yes\" victory in the upcoming 1998 Danish Amsterdam Treaty referendum.\nAftermath\nThe acceptance of the government's measures to end the strike led to an increase in discontent with trade unions in Denmark. The end of the strike also saw a drop in union members contributions to the Social Democrats.\n",

    "1941 United States Supreme Court case\nSkiriotes v. Florida, 313 U.S. 69 (1941), was a Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the states, under the authority of the Tenth Amendment, do have the authority to govern their citizens' conduct in the sea, when not in conflict of federal law. The Appellant in this case challenged his conviction under a Florida law which prohibited citizens from using diving equipment to gather sponges in the Gulf of Mexico or the Straits of Florida. It also further allowed States to have a broad authority in deciding their own maritime boundary, when approved by Congress. \nHistorical context\nThis case begins on March 8, 1938, when Lambris Skiriotes, a resident of Pinellas County, Florida, was spotted using diving equipment two marine leagues (6 miles) off the coast of Pinellas County. The sheriff of the county shortly thereafter went to the Pinellas County Courthouse and requested an arrest warrant against Skiriotes, which was granted and executed. Interestingly, Skiriotes challenged his imprisonment to a United States district court with a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted but reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Cunningham v. Skiriotes, 101 F.2d 635 (1939). \nNevertheless, Skiriotes was found guilty of violating the Compiled General Laws of Florida (1927), Section 8087 by Circuit Judge John U. Bird. The criminal statute reads as follows:\"It shall be unlawful for any person, persons, firm or corporation to maintain an'd use for the purpose of catching or taking commercial sponges from the Gulf of Mexico, or the straits of Florida or other waters within the territorial limits of the state of Florida, diving suits, helmets, or other apparatus used by deep sea divers. \nAnyone violating any of the provisions of this section shall be fined in the sum not exceeding five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\"\nAppeal to the Florida Supreme Court\nFollowing his conviction, Skiriotes filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida to review his case. On September 6, 1940, Chief Justice William Glenn Terrell, on behalf of Justice Elwyn Thomas, Justice James B. Whitfield, Justice Armstead Brown, Justice Rivers H. Buford, and Justice Roy H. Chapman, wrote the majority opinion of the court, in which it ruled unanimously against him and denied his petition.\nThe court reviewed Skiriotes' review which was based on the argument that Florida lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him at any point in the water past one marine league (3 miles) off the coast, seeing as the territorial jurisdiction of the United States only extended that far. He argued that the Florida Constitution approved by the United States Congress in 1885 which set the Florida maritime limit at three marine leagues (9 miles) was contrary to international law, which generally recognized a nation's maritime limit to be one marine league. The Court recognized as such, stating,\"In the absence of affirmative action on this point the Supreme Court of the United States has generally assumed the sovereignty of the State to extend one marine league from shore. This distance was fixed because it was at the time considered to be the range of a cannon shot and that the State should be permitted to protect that distance from its shore.\"Skiriotes further argued that when Congress passed an act readmitting Florida into the Union, although making reference to its 1868 Constitution, did not \"constitute an approval\" of such, and thus did not give Florida the authority to set its maritime boundary at three marine leagues. The Court however, disagreed entirely, ultimately stating, \"t appears that any State by approval of Congress has a right to fix its marine boundaries and that if fixed in reason, such right has never been questioned by Congress by any other nation or citizen thereof...It follows that the western boundary of Florida as defined in its Constitution at three marine leagues from shore is conclusive and being so by the agreed statement of facts, petitioner was guilty of violating Section 8087\"Following the decision, Skiriotes once again sought appellate review, and this time filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nThe Supreme Court did grant Skiriotes' petition, and on March 14, 1941, held oral arguments, and handed down its decision on April 28, 1941. Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes handed down the Court's majority opinion in favor of the State of Florida. \nThe Court firstly tackled the international law issue raised by Skiriotes, in which he now opted to raise various constitutional sections, treaties, and correspondence of the United States. The Supreme Court, noting the prior opinion of the Florida Court, cast aside these challenges, stating, \"one of the treaties which appellant cites is applicable to h",

It supports shortening the work week, first to 32 hours and later to 28 hours, encouraging the expansion of trade unions, progressive taxes on corporations, businesses and high-income landlords, reducing food prices, regulating the housing market by setting rent caps, and expanding women's rights and LGBT rights in Lithuania. It promotes the creation of economic democracy by promoting worker cooperatives instead of private ownership.\nIt supports Lithuania's membership in NATO and the European Union, and the strengthening of national defense. It supports Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War and, alongside the Trade Union \"May 1st\", agitates for debt forgiveness to Ukraine, as well as harsher sanctions and support to the labor movement in Ukraine. It condemns Israel's actions against Palestinians and supports a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.\n",
    "Indian islamic scholar (1872\u20131964)\nAbul Hasanat Sayyid Abdullah Shah Naqshbandi Qadiri (6 February 1872\u201327 August 1964) also known as Hadrat Abdullah Shah Sahib, was a scholar of Islam and spiritual reformer. He is more particularly known as a muhaddith, honorifically as Muhaddith-e Dakkan (the Muhaddith of the Dakkan). His contributions to Islamic scholarship and spirituality have left a lasting impact. His scholarly contributions include extensive writings on Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and his best-known work, Zujajat al-Masabih, which is a comprehensive collection of Hadiths aligned with the Hanafi school of law, compiled into five volumes.\nEarly life\nHe was born in the Qadiri family in Aurangabad, India. He received his early education in Islamic sciences and Arabic literature.\nSpiritual life\nAbdullah Shah Naqshbandi's spiritual teachings were rooted in the principles of the Naqshbandi Sufi order. His guidance emphasized the importance of inner contemplation, remembrance of God (dhikr), and spiritual connection with the divine. Key aspects of his teachings:\nAwareness of Numbers (wuquf adadi): This practice involves a conscious awareness of the number of times one recites a particular dhikr or divine name, fostering focus and mindfulness.\nAwareness of the Heart (wuquf qalbi): It encourages the seeker to maintain a constant state of awareness and presence of heart, especially during the recitation of dhikr.\nSilent Dhikr: Naqshbandi's practice includes silent dhikr, which is the remembrance of God without vocalization, allowing for a deeper internal connection.\nThe \u2018Uwaysi\u2019 Transmission of Spiritual Knowledge: This refers to a form of spiritual guidance received not through physical interaction but through a connection in the spiritual realm with past saints and prophets.\nSpiritual Exercises: The Naqshbandi path includes specific spiritual exercises designed to remove the veils between the seeker and their heavenly position, bringing them closer to the Divine Presence.\nThese teachings aim to cultivate a direct and personal experience of the divine, transcending formal rituals and external observances to achieve a state of unity with God. The Naqshbandi way, as taught by Abdullah Shah Naqshbandi, is a path of purification and self-improvement, leading to spiritual enlightenment and closeness to the divine.\nLiterary works\nSome of his notable literary works include:\nNoor Ul Masabeeh: This is a comprehensive book on Hanafi Fiqh, which he spent almost 50 years writing. It covers various chapters such as Aqaid, Salah, Zakat, Nikah, etc., and is spread across 12 volumes.\nGulzar E Auliya: This book provides brief accounts of the lives and teachings of Naqshbandi saints.\nFazail E Ramzan: This book discusses the virtues and blessings of Ramadan, along with other spiritual topics.\nZujajat al-Masabih: A unique and comprehensive collection of Hadiths pertaining to the Hanafi school of law, compiled into five volumes.\nThese books continue to be influential in the study of Sufism and Islamic spirituality.\n",
    "Former lifeboat station in Northumberland, England\nAlnmouth Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the village of Alnmouth, near the town of Alnwick, in the county of Northumberland. \nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1854. The station was closed in 1935.\nHistory\nIn 1851, Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, of Alnwick Castle, had been appointed president of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS). He set a competition for the design of a Self-righting lifeboat, with the reward of \u00a3100, which was won by James Beeching of Great Yarmouth.\nBeeching presented a 22-foot version of his boat, named Lucy, to the Duchess of Northumberland, intended for personal use. A boathouse was built on Northumberland's land at Alnmouth, and the boat was delivered in September 1852. However, the boat was then used for lifeboat trials by Capt. John Ross Ward, RN, Inspector of Lifeboats. With a crew of local men, they rowed the boat through the surf, eventually managing to roll the vessel, pitching Capt. Ward into the sea. The  boat performed as designed, righting itself, and Capt. Ward was quickly recovered. Many subsequent lifeboats would follow this design. For his efforts, Capt. Ward was awarded the Silver Medal.\nWith the boat and boathouse already in place, there was effectively a lifeboat station in Alnmouth from 1852. In 1854, the Duke of Northumberland formally transferred the lifeboat and boathouse to the (now renamed) RNLI, thus creating Alnmouth Lifeboat Station. The boat was sent to Forrestt of Limehouse for some modifications, returning in December 1854. A launch carriage was provided in 1856, and a larger boathouse was funded by the Duke and constructed in 1860.\nThree further lifeboats would see service at Alnmouth. In 1865, the RNLI would order a 32-foot 10-oar pulling and sailing lifeboat (one with oars and sails) from Forrestt of Limehouse. A gift of \u00a3320 from Miss Wardell of Tunbridge Wells funded the boat, which was transported to Alnwick free of charge by the Great Northern and North Eastern Railway Companies, arriving in March 1865. The boat was named John Atkinson. In 1888, Alnmouth would receive Allen Scott (ON 171), a 34-foot 10-oar Self Righting (P&S) lifeboat costing \u00a3329, constructed by Woolfe of Shadwell, and funded from the legacy of Mr T. W. Allen of Newbury, Berkshire. Then in 1909, a 34-foot 10-oar Self-righting Dungeness-class lifeboat constructed by Thames Ironworks, provided by a gift from Miss Maria Mercer of Clayton-le-Moors in Lancashire, and named John and Robert C. Mercer (ON 591).\nAlnmouth lifeboat station was closed in 1935. In 82 years service, the lifeboats would be launched only 19 times, and rescue 15 lives. The John and Robert C. Mercer (ON 591) was transferred to Newburgh, serving a further six years. Both the 1852 and 1860 boathouses remain, and are currently used by the Alnmouth Community Rowing Club.\nAlnmouth lifeboats\n^ ON is the RNLI's Official Number of the boat.\nSee also\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\nNotes\n^ 22-foot x 5-foot 6in 4-oared Self-righting lifeboat, built by James Beeching of Great Yarmouth, modified by Forrestt of Limehouse, London\n^ 32-foot x 7-foot 5in 10-oared Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, built by Forrestt of Limehouse, London\n^ 34-foot x 7-foot 6in 10-oared Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, built by Woolfe of Shadwell\n^ 34-foot x 8-foot 10-oared Self-righting Dungeness-class lifeboat, built by Thames Ironworks\n",
    "Species of lichen\nPhyscia magnussonii is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Physciaceae. It was formally described as a new species in 1952 by the Swiss botanist Eduard Frey. He collected the type specimen in Bern, Switzerland. The species epithet honours the Swedish lichenologist Adolf Hugo Magnusson. Frey's original specimen was later declared the lectotype of the species by Roland Moberg in a 1977 monograph on the genus Physcia.\nPhyscia magnussonii has a heteromerous and dorsiventral thallus with narrow lobes that form tightly packed, circular rosettes. The lichen produces apothecia (fruiting bodies) with club-shaped asci containing eight ascospores, and also produces pycnidia with asexual conidia, with chemical properties including the presence of atranorin.\nDescription\nPhyscia magnussonii is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure. The thallus\u2014the main body of the lichen\u2014is heteromerous and dorsiventral, with narrow lobes that are closely pressed against the substrate. These lobes form tightly packed, circular rosettes that can reach up to 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in) in diameter. The lobes themselves are up to 3\u00a0mm wide, generally overlap each other, and are slightly convex. The colour of the lobes ranges from whitish grey to brownish grey, and they are uniformly covered with a dense, white powdery coating (pruina). The underside of the thallus is white to brownish, featuring a few thick and simple rhizines, which are root-like structures that help anchor the lichen.\nThe upper layer of the thallus, or cortex, is made of densely packed cells (paraplectenchymatous), while the inner layer, or medulla, is white. Physcia magnussonii commonly produces apothecia (fruiting bodies) that are up to 3\u00a0mm across. These have a black disc that is usually white-pruinose and are bordered by a smooth, thallus-like margin. The fruiting bodies contain spore-producing structures called asci, which are club-shaped, very thin-walled, and feature a tall, blue-staining tholus with an indistinct amyloid ring when treated with iodine (K/I+ blue), characteristic of the Lecanora-type asci. Each ascus holds eight ascospores.\nThe spores are one-septate (divided into two cells by an internal partition, or septum), brown, and narrowly ellipsoid, measuring 16\u201324 by 6\u20139\u00a0\u03bcm. They have a unique verrucose (warty) ornamentation and have thickened walls at the apex and septum, typical of the genus Physcia. Pycnidia, small fruiting bodies containing asexual spores (conidia), are also common and appear as immersed black dots. The conidia are almost cylindrical in shape.\nIn terms of chemical properties, the cortex tests K+ (yellow), indicating the presence of atranorin, a common lichen product, whereas other chemical spot tests on the medulla may show negative (K\u2212) or a pale pink reaction (K+ pale pink), with no reaction to other tests: (C\u2212), (KC\u2212), and paraphenylenediamine (P\u2212).\nVariolaric acid is a secondary metabolite (lichen product) that has been shown to occur in some Norwegian specimens of Physcia magnussonii. This rare depsidone substance is know to occur in only a few lichen species, mostly in the order Pertusariales.\nSpecies interactions\nZwackhiomyces turcicus is a lichenicolous fungus that was reported growing on the thalli of Physcia magnussonii lichens in southern Turkey. Infection by the commensalistic or weakly parasitic fungus results in slight bleaching on the infected part of the host thallus. The fungus is only know to occur in its type locality in Pinus nigra forest in Gevne Vadisi, Ta\u015fkent.\nHabitat and distribution\nPhyscia magnussonii is found in Northern and Central Europe, and Greenland. In North America, its distribution is poorly known, but it has been recorded in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho southwards to Colorado.\n",
    "River in Bulgaria\nThe Dvoynitsa (Bulgarian: \u0414\u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430) is a 52\u00a0km long river in eastern Bulgaria that flows into the Black Sea.\nGeography\nThe river takes its source under the name Lekarnitsa from a spring at an altitude of 440\u00a0m in the Eminska Planina division of the Balkan Mountains. It flows in northern direction in a deep forested valley until the village of Golitsa. It then turns in direction east\u2013southeast for the duration of its remaining course, as it valley widens and divides the Kamchiyska Planina to the north and Eminska Planina to the south. The Dvoynitsa flows into the Black Sea in the northeastern outskirts of the town of Obzor. Due to the small gradient, the river forms many meanders.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 479\u00a0km2. To the north its basin follows the ridge of the Kamchiyska Planina, which separates it from the neighbouring basins of the Kamchiya and the Fandakliyska reka. To the south the ridge of the Eminska Planina forms the boundary with the drainage systems of the Hadzhiyska reka and several small short rivers that empty into the Black Sea. The Dvoynitsa receives mainly rain feed, which forms 45% of the inflow. The period of high water lasts for four months, during which the average flow is 7\u00a0m3/s. It largest tributary is the Velikovska reka (25\u00a0km).\nNature\nThe river banks are covered with forest vegetation of willows, poplars, elms, ashes, linden, oaks and the rare Oriental beech, often overgrown with climbing vegetation of ivies, leather flowers and Smilax. At places there are reeds and cattails. There is diverse avifauna with at least 50 species only in the river mouth, such as common redshank, common moorhen, common sandpiper, common tern, mallard, great reed warbler, common kingfisher, western yellow wagtail, squacco heron, grey heron, little egret, etc. Local birds of prey include Eurasian sparrowhawk, common buzzard, Eurasian scops owl, tawny owl and little owl. There are fish populations of Eurasian carp, common chub, Romanian barbel, Flathead grey mullet and others, that support the aquatic birds.\nSettlements and economy\nThe Dvoynitsa flows in Burgas and Varna Provinces and downstream of Golitsa its valley serves as border between the two administrative divisions. There are three settlements along its course, the village of Koznitsa and the town of Obzor in Nesebar Municipality of Burgas Province and village of Popovich in Byala Municipality of Varna Province. Its waters in the middle and lower course are utilised for irrigation, the main crops being barley, maize, peaches, apples, grapes, almonds, lavender.\nHistory\nIn the Antiquity the river was crossed by a Roman road that followed the Black Sea Coast linking a road station and castrum at the modern town of Obzor just south of the river to the settlement at Cape St. Athanasius a few kilometers to the north. The castrum at Obzor was abandoned in the 5th\u20136th century AD. Along the ridge of the Eminska Planina south of the river there were several fortresses that protected the northern border of the Byzantine Empire. In the 13th and 14th century the Bulgarian Empire constructed the important fortress and town of Kozyak on a height over river banks some 3\u00a0km upstream from its mouth, which guarded the only road along the coastline. During the Uprising of Ivaylo (1277\u20131280) Kozyak was temporarily occupied by the Byzantines. In 1366 the fortress was one of the several Bulgarian maritime strongholds captured by Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy during the Savoyard Crusade. It was finally destroyed in the late 14th century during the Bulgarian\u2013Ottoman wars.\nCitations\n^ a b c d Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria 1980, p.\u00a0161\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m Boev, Zlatozar (July 2015). \"River Dvoynitsa\" (PDF).

    "Municipal building in Handsworth, West Midlands, England\nThe Council House is a former municipal building in Soho Road in Handsworth, West Midlands, a suburb of Birmingham in England. The building, which is currently used as a public library and college campus, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with steam engine manufacturing at Soho Foundry, a local board of health was formed in Handsworth in 1877. The board decided to commission a municipal building for its use. The site selected was on the north side of Soho Road.\nThe foundation stone for the new building was laid on 30 October 1877. It was designed by Alexander & Henman of Stockton-on-Tees in the Gothic Revival style, built in red brick and terracotta at a cost of \u00a320,662 and was completed in 1879. The design involved a main frontage of 16 bays facing onto Soho Road. The left-hand section of five bays formed a public library and the right-hand section of 11 bays formed the council house. The library section, which was asymmetrical, featured a polygon-shaped bay which was projected forward and surmounted by a turret, and there was an arched doorway in the right-hand bay. The council house section, which was broadly symmetrical, featured a five-stage tower in the central bay. There was an arched doorway in the first stage, an oriel window in the second stage, lancet windows in the third and fourth stages, with machicolations above, and a timbered clock in the fifth stage. The central bay was flanked by connecting sections of two bays each and by end sections of three bays each which were slightly projected forward and gabled. The other bays were generally fenestrated with bi-partite or tri-partite mullioned and transomed windows.\nIn 1894, the board was succeeded by Handsworth Urban District Council, which used the Council House as its offices, but the building ceased to be the local seat of government when area was annexed by Birmingham City Council in 1911.\nThe council house was subsequently leased to the Handsworth School of Dress Design, which was a branch of the Birmingham Government School of Design. The Birmingham Government School of Design became part of Birmingham Polytechnic in 1971. In the late 1970s, the vacant building was acquired by Handsworth Technical College (later City College Birmingham), which merged with South Birmingham College to form the Handsworth Campus of South and City College Birmingham in 2012.\n",
    "\nThe Lopburi tram system (Thai: \u0e23\u0e16\u0e23\u0e32\u0e07\u0e25\u0e1e\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35) was a transport system in Mueang Lopburi district, Lopburi province, Thailand. It was the only provincial tramway system located outside Bangkok and was operated with electric trams.\nHistory\nThe Lopburi tramway system was built following the plans of then prime minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram to expand Lopburi into a \"military city\" and develop the local transportation infrastructure. Further plans to develop tramway systems in other major cities such as Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima and Songkhla were also studied, but none were ever constructed. The system was inaugurated by Phibunsongkhram on 31 January 1955 and consisted of a single line, running from San Phra Kan to Erawan Intersection, near the present-day King Narai Hospital. Rolling stock used were disused electric trams from Bangkok's tramway. The opening of the line saw significant usage in its early days and was extended west to Tha Pho Market in the old town area.\nDecline\nBy 1960, increased bus services in the area, also serving Tha Pho Market and overlapping the tram route meant passenger volumes started to decrease. The scarcity of oil after World War II, meant tram services occasionally had to be suspended, as was the case with some tram lines in Bangkok. This, coupled with the increase in private car ownership in Lopburi meant using trams were slower than going by road, in some cases obstructing traffic as well. After repeated financial losses, the short-lived Lopburi tramway system operated its final services on 1 December 1962.\nAt present, the only tracks in Lopburi remaining are in the U Rotrang Kao (Former Tram Depot) community, located near Erawan Intersection.\nOperations\nRoute Alignment\nInitially, the line started behind Si Sunthon Roundabout (San Phra Kan) and ran on Narai Maharat Road until Si Suriyothai Roundabout (Sa Kaeo), where it ran along the outer southern semi-circle curve. The line then continues on Narai Maharat Road, crossing Saphan 7 Bridge and reaching the inner circle of Thep Satri Roundabout (King Narai Monument), running adjacent to Lopburi Provincial Hall. The line then turns northward onto Phahonyothin Road, terminating near the 6th Infantry Battalion Camp (now the 31st Infantry Regiment) at Erawan Intersection where Phahonyothin Road intersects with Highway 3016. This route was approximately 4.8 kilometres (3.0\u00a0mi).\nA west extension to Tha Pho Market was constructed not long after the initial line's opening, although it is not recorded exactly when. The line was extended along the northern semi-circle curve of Si Sunthon Roundabout, crossing the State Railway of Thailand's Northern Line, passing in front of Phra Prang Sam Yot on Prang Sam Yot Road. The route then turned northward near Prang Khaek onto Sura Songkhram Road and terminated at Tha Pho Market near the Lopburi City Pillar Shrine. This resulted in a disputed total route length of 6.5 kilometres (4.0\u00a0mi), or 7.2 kilometres (4.5\u00a0mi) according to some sources.\nTicketing\nThe tram line was separated into two ticketing sections, one between Tha Pho Market and Si Suriyothai Roundabout and another between Si Suriyothai Roundabout to Erawan Intersection. Traveling within each section cost 25 satang. Crossing between sections and traveling the entire line cost 40 satang (100 satang = 1 baht).\nSee also\nTransport in Thailand\nTrams in Bangkok\nTrams in Asia\nList of town tramway systems in Asia\n",

    "American basketball player and coach (1930\u20132019)\nDon Johnson (1930 \u2013 February 6, 2019) was an American basketball player and coach. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins under head coach John Wooden. As senior, Johnson received honorable mention from United Press International for their All-American team in 1952. He became a junior college coach at Cypress College in Cypress, California, leading the Chargers to a 588\u2013259 record with two state titles and seven conference championships.\nAt the time of his retirement from Cypress, Johnson had the most wins among California junior college men's basketball coaches. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame, and Cypress dedicated its basketball court \"Don Johnson Court\".\nPlaying career\nAfter graduating from El Monte High School in El Monte, California, Johnson attended Fullerton College from 1948 to 1950, and he was named the Eastern Conference's most valuable player for the 1949\u201350 season. He played college basketball at the University of California, Los Angeles. It was early in Bruins coach John Wooden's tenure at the school, about a decade before he would win the first of 11 national champitonships.  Replacing graduated star George Stanich at guard, Johnson led the Bruins to two Southern Division championships in the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), and he led the team in rebounding in both of his seasons.\nAs a junior in 1950\u201351, Johnson averaged 5.2 rebounds per game and received honorable mention for the PCC All-Southern Division team. He averaged 5.8 rebounds in 1951\u201352, when UCLA won the PCC title and qualified for the 1952 NCAA tournament. He was named a third-team All-American by the Helms Athletic Foundation and earned honorable mention from UPI. He and teammate Jerry Norman, the Bruins' co-captains, were unanimous selections for the PCC All-Southern Division team. In 61 career games, Johnson averaged 9.8 points. His 596 points set a UCLA record for players who only played two seasons, breaking Carl Kraushaar's previous high of 543.\nStanding at 6\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (1.91\u00a0m) and 195 pounds (88\u00a0kg), Johnson was among the bigger guards in that era. Wooden said that he \"was a well-rounded basketball player. He played good defense, passed the ball well, could drive to the basket and was a pretty good outside shooter.\" Like a smaller guard, he could bring the ball up, and was also able to defend forwards due to his rebounding ability.\nCoaching career\nIn 1954, Johnson became a teacher at El Rancho High School in Pico Rivera, California. As their varsity basketball coach, he led them to the playoffs six times in his 12 seasons. He joined Cypress College when it opened in 1966.  Johnson led the Chargers to state championships in 1977 and 1980 along with seven conference titles. Seventeen times they won 20 or more games in a season and reached the state semifinals four times.\nJohnson's players included future UCLA and National Basketball Association (NBA) centers Mark Eaton and Swen Nater, neither of whom had much basketball experience before joining Cypress. Afterwards, the school gained a reputation for developing big men. Eaton and Nater both set NBA records. The 7-foot-4-inch (2.24\u00a0m) Eaton holds the NBA single-season records for total blocks (456) and blocks per game (5.6) as well as the career record for blocks per game (3.5). The 6-foot-11-inch (2.11\u00a0m) Nater is the only player to lead both the American Basketball Association and NBA in rebounding, and he also holds the NBA record for defensive rebounds in a half (18).\nJohnson was never attracted to head coaching opportunities at four-year colleges, preferring the purer coaching environment of junior colleges. He retired in 1994 after 27 seasons with Cypress, compiling a 588\u2013259 record, at time the most wins by a California junior college men's basketball coach. In 1996, he joined Biola University as an assistant coach under Dave Holmquist, who played for Johnson at Cypress from 1969 to 1971. Johnson remained at Biola until his death in 2019.\nLegacy\nJohnson with UCLA in 1950\nJohnson was inducted into the Orange County Hall of Fame in 1996, the Fullerton College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2010, and the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2013. Cypress honored him in 2009 by renaming its basketball court \"Don Johnson Court\".\nPersonal life\nJohnson's father, Jack, was a basketball coach at El Monte High. Johnson's mother, Cecile Sparks, played basketball at the University of Kansas for James Naismith, the game's inventor.\nJohnson met his wife, Colette (n\u00e9e Hill), when he was attending Fullerton. They married before his second season at UCLA. They had three children. She worked at the ASUCLA News Bureau while he was playing for the Bruins. She was later as an administrative assistant at Cypress, helping open the school in 1966.\nJohnson died on February 6, 2019, at the age of 88.\nNotes\n^ His age in one source implies that he was born in 1929/1930, while his age in another indicates that it was 1930/1931",

    "\nBritish company\nEland Cables is a company headquartered in London, with its principal operations in Yorkshire, UK. The company supplies electrical cables to the energy infrastructure industry in Europe. It specialises in distributing cables used in large civil engineering projects. Its cables are typically used in power and lighting solutions.\nHistory\nEstablished in 1975, ownership transferred to companies including Unidare before a management buy-out in 2005. Subsequently, the company has achieved approximately \u00a3200 million in annual revenue.\nIts executive director, Jean-Sebastien Pelland, moved to London from Montreal in 2001 as a finance graduate. He took a role at HW Fisher, a chartered accountancy firm, advising the company in its MBO before joining the board in 2008.\nIt has supplied the cables for various major infrastructure projects across the UK, including the electrification of the Great Western Main Line.\nThe company changed its employee remuneration around 2017 due to workforce migration towards Amazon's higher-paying jobs in its South Yorkshire warehouse. In response, the company adjusted its pay structure from the national minimum to a higher living wage, aligning with standards set by the independent Living Wage Foundation. Additionally, it offered a living wage-plus salary, alongside additional benefits such as health insurance coverage for its employees.\nFrom 2020, the company experienced a significant surge in demand and benefitted from private and public sector investment in decarbonisation and digitisation initiatives. In 2022, the company reported a turnover of \u00a3200.3 million, a 24% increase from the previous year and a substantial rise from the \u00a3107.6 million recorded in 2020. The company attributes this growth to the UK's ambitious efforts to overhaul its energy supply and distribution networks. Additionally, it benefitted from high-growth sectors such as renewable energy, battery storage, mobility and automation.\nEland Cables opened a large cable recycling plant that processes end-of-life cables and their materials. This facility recycles copper, aluminium, and other materials. The recycled materials are used for playground matting. The company recycles its floor sweepings and other site waste and turns non-recyclable materials into biofuel pellets for industrial kilns.\n",
    "Filipino judge (1920-1995)\nVicente G. Ericta (February 15, 1915 - February 18, 2007) was a former associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. He was sworn in as a member of the Supreme Court by President Ferdinand Marcos on November 20, 1981, but resigned on May 11, 1982 after being involved in a scandal over the admission of his son as a lawyer, in a case that also saw the resignation of the entire Supreme Court. \nBiography\nBorn in Laoag, Ilocos Norte on February 15, 1915, Ericta finished his elementary and secondary education in Ilocos Norte. He obtained his pre-law degree and law degree from the University of the Philippines College of Law where he graduated in 1939. He was a classmate of Ferdinand Marcos, who later appointed him to government positions during his presidency.\nDuring the Second World War, he was appointed as military mayor of Laoag.\nEricta's career in the judiciary began in 1946, when he was appointed as Assistant Provincial Fiscal (prosecutor) of Ilocos Norte. He then became a judge in Pagadian, Zamboanga del Sur in 1966 and later held judgeships in Rizal and Quezon City. In 1975, he joined the Court of Appeals as an associate justice before being appointed by President Marcos as Tanodbayan (predecessor of the Ombudsman of the Philippines) in 1979. In 1981, he was appointed as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. At the same time, Ericta also taught law at the Northwestern College of Law in Laoag.\nResignation\nEricta's tenure in the Supreme Court was cut short after he was implicated in a scandal over the conduct of the 1981 Philippine Bar Examinations that were overseen by the court. In March 1982, Associate Justice Ameurfina Melencio-Herrera publicly said that the mercantile law grades of Ericta's son Gustavo, who took the examination, was changed from 56 to 58 percent prior to publication of the test results to enable him to pass with a general average of 73 and become a fully-pledged lawyer. Chief Justice Enrique Fernando subsequently admitted ordering the revision in the younger Ericta's grade but denied allegations of unethical behavior, saying that it was done to correct an \"oversight\" by the examiner upon the advice of justices Ramon Aquino and Ramon Fernandez, who were prematurely shown Ericta's grades, and citing a similar predicament with one of his sons, who died shortly after passing the bar exam.\nFollowing public uproar and demands for their impeachment, all 14 members of the Supreme Court, including six justices who were not directly involved in the grade tampering, submitted their resignation to President Marcos on May 11. All of them were subsequently reappointed days later by Marcos, except for Ericta and Fernandez, who were both \"found responsible\" for the scandal by a group of former justices advising the president.\nDeath\nEricta died in 2007.\n",
    "Warblish refers to humans vocally imitating bird vocalizations using existing words and phrases in a human language. The term was coined by linguist Hannah Sarvasy in a 2017 academic paper that examined different techniques humans use to mimic birdsong.\nCharacteristics\nUnlike onomatopoeia, where nonsense words are created to sound like a bird's call, warblish uses real lexical items in a language to represent birdsong. For example, the call of the Barred Owl may be rendered as \"Who cooks for you?\" in English warblish.\nWarblish can take the form of phrases, sentences, or even dialogues attributed to birds. The meaning of the words often relates to the bird species in some way, either referring to its behavior, ecosystem role, mythology, or other cultural associations. However, warblish can also be humorous or nonsensical.\nSome examples of English warblish given by Sarvasy include:\nNorthern waterthrush: Nice old ladies don't chew tobacco\nCalifornia quail: Chicago! Chicago!\nThe sounds and meaning of warblish for the same bird species often varies across cultures. While warblish functions partly as mimicry of birdsong, features like rhythm, pitch, and timing may be more important for accuracy than the specific words used.\nImportant\nWhile warblish might seem trival, it has been suggested to have nontrival functions.Warblish seems at first to be a trivial phenomenon, a clownish verbal play between children or whimsical adults calling out cheeeeeseburger or whip poor will to the birds. Beyond its role as a mnemonic to help people recognize birds by their calls, it is a meaningful biocultural sensory practice that helps train people to listen carefully, make the world \u201cone\u2019s own\u201d and pay careful attention to the ecologies of the other-than-human life around them.In many societies, warblish serves as more than just a mnemonic device for remembering bird vocalizations. Sarvasy outlines several functions and meanings associated with warblish cross-culturally:Heralding seasonal changes, planting/harvesting times Warning humans of approaching people, animals, or spirits Referencing mythology in which people transform into birds Describing observable bird behaviors and routines Facetious or humorous attributions.\nResearch\nAccording to Sarvasy, warblish has been overlooked as a topic of study compared to onomatopoeia and non-vocal mimicry of birdsong. More research is needed into the forms warblish takes across cultures, its functions and meanings, conventionality within speech communities, and how it relates to cultural knowledge of avian ecology and behavior. Cataloging examples of warblish from around the world can provide insights into humans' creative linguistic responses to the natural environment. A recent study has found warblish to widespread across cultures.\nSee also\nPish\nIdeophone\n",

She is considered one of the most prolific female Greek Modernist writers.\nBiography\nThe writer and activist was born Galateia Alexiou in Heraklion, on the Greek island of Crete, in 1884, although some sources give her birth year as 1881. Her father, Stylianos Alexiou, was a publisher and author, and her sister, Ellie Alexiou, also became a well-known writer.\nKazantzakis began her career as a journalist, with her first piece appearing in the Cretan publication Pinakothiki in 1906. She then began to publish translations from French, reviews, and short prose pieces in Pinakothiki and other publications such as the magazine Panathinea. In 1909, she published her first novella, Ridi, Pagliaccio (\"Laugh, Clown\"), in the journal Nouma. This was followed by various works including the 1915 lyric narrative Brief Prose Portraits, the 1927 short story collection 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., and, in 1933, her first novel, Women. She wrote under various pen names, including Lalo de Castro and Petroula Psiloriti.\nFrom her earliest writing, Kazantzakis advocated for feminist empowerment and the dismantling of male-dominated social structures. She notably wrote in Demotic vernacular, the language of everyday people.\nKazantzakis became increasingly involved in left-wing politics and activism during the interwar years, identifying herself as both a feminist and a socialist. She served as editor in chief of the communist publication Protoporoi and then the Trostkyist-leaning Nea Epitheorisi. In her writing, she condemned women's sexual and labor exploitation. During World War II, she was active in the Greek resistance. She would be persecuted for her communism, losing her job at the Athens municipal library after the war over her views, but she was never exiled or imprisoned at length.\nCritics argue her work has been undervalued in the shadow of her former husband Nikos Kazantzakis, a major figure in modern Greek literature known for such books as Zorba the Greek. After a year living together in Athens, in 1911, the couple married, despite the groom's father opposing the union. They would divorce in 1926. In 1933, she remarried Markos Avgeris\u00a0, also a writer, whom she had known for decades, but she still published under her former husband's surname.\nIn her later years, Kazantzakis continued to produce fiction, including the short prose collection Turning Points (1952). Her last book, 1956's Humans and Superhumans, was a work of autobiographical fiction that dealt with her tumultuous relationship with her former husband. It is considered her best-known novel.\nKazantzakis was also a prolific playwright. In 1933, her play While the Ship Sails became particularly well known after it was performed by the National Theatre of Greece. Her collected plays, 17 in total, were published in 1957.\nShe died in 1962, after a motor accident in Athens.\n",
    "Intercollegiate beach volleyball tournament\nCollegiate beach volleyball tournament\nThe 2024 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship (officially the 2024 National Collegiate Beach Volleyball Championship) was an intercollegiate tournament to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) women's beach volleyball national champion for the 2023\u201324 season. The eighth edition of the tournament was held from May 3 to 5, 2024, at Gulf Place Public Beach in Gulf Shores, Alabama. The 2024 championship featured a single-elimination-only bracket for the second time, along with an expanded 17-team field. Nine of the participating schools automatically qualified by winning their respective conference tournaments, while the other eight were given at-large bids by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. The tournament was broadcast on ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPNU.\nBackground\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) began sponsoring women's beach volleyball as a championship sport in 2016, and the sport has since experienced rapid growth at the collegiate level, with a 500 percent increase in women's collegiate beach volleyball programs in the United States from 2011 to 2020. The NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship is the tournament held at the end of every regular season to determine the women's national collegiate champion across all NCAA divisions. It has been held annually since the inaugural 2016 event, and 2023 marked its seventh edition. The 2023 tournament was held in Gulf Shores, Alabama, the same venue that hosted all six previous championships, and was co-hosted by Gulf Shores Orange Beach Sports & Events, the city of Gulf Shores, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nPopularized on the beaches of California in the 1920s, beach volleyball is a sport played by two teams on a sand court. At the professional level, teams consist of a pair of players who compete in best-of-three-set matches, where the first two sets are played to 21 points and the third set, if necessary, is played to 15 points; each set must be won by a minimum two-point lead. Conversely, NCAA beach volleyball is played using a flighted team-dual format. In an NCAA dual, each team fields five individual pairs who are ranked from No. 1 to No. 5 by skill level, and each pair plays a flighted best-of-three-set match against their corresponding pair on the other team. The first team to win three of the five pairs' matches wins the dual.\nThe NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship had historically been an eight-team double-elimination tournament, in which all participating teams were selected by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. However, with the growing popularity of the collegiate sport, the NCAA agreed to double the field for the 2022 championship, adding a 16-team opening knockout round that led into the established eight-team double-elimination bracket. Along with the expanded field, the qualification process introduced eight automatic bids that teams earned by winning their respective conference tournaments. Further changes were adopted for 2023, with the tournament becoming a single-elimination-only event, and the field expanded to 17 teams to allow for nine automatic qualifiers.\nFormat and venue\nThe 2024 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship is a 17-team tournament that was held from May 3 to 5, 2024. The tournament began on Friday, May 3, with a play-in dual between the two lowest seeded teams. The 16-team single-elimination main bracket also began on Friday, May 3, with the winning teams advancing to the quarterfinals and semifinals on Saturday, May 4, until a national champion was determined on Sunday, May 5.\nThe tournament took place on one site at the Gulf Place Public Beach in Gulf Shores, which had been set up with five playing courts and five practice courts. Over the years, the playing conditions at the Gulf Shores venue have been characterized by several factors; namely the compact sand that makes it easier for players to move and jump, the strong winds, and the possibility of rain during that time of the year.\nParticipating teams\nOf the 93 eligible NCAA teams, a total of 17 qualified for the tournament and were seeded from No. 1 to No. 17. Nine of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their respective conference tournaments. The remaining eight bids were allocated at large by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. The qualifying teams and seeding order were announced by the committee on April 28, 2024.\nAutomatic bids\nThe following nine teams earned automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments.\nAt-large bids\nThe following eight teams were allocated at-large bids by the NCAA selection committee.\nPreview\nFrom its inception in 2016 to 2023, only two teams had won the NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship: the USC Trojans (five titles and two-time defending champion: 2016, 2017, 2021, 2022 and 2023) and the UCLA Bruins (two titles: 2018 and 2019).

    "\n1928 United States Supreme Court case\nUnited States v. Manzi, 276 U.S. 463 (1928), was a Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that in order to receive the full benefits of citizenship, the widow of an alien who passed away after declaring his intent to become a citizen, but before being naturalized, must file her petition within the time frame set by law, at the time being 7 years after the declaration of intent was filed. This case established that when applying for citizenship, the action undertaken by an alien to become naturalized is to be understood to also be \"as though taken by the widow herself.\"\nHistorical context\nThis case begins with Aniello Manzi, an alien who had been undergoing the naturalization process who further filed a declaration of intention to become a citizen on October 15, 1913. Aniello, however, died on December 19, 1914, before he was finally naturalized as a citizen. This left his wife, Amalia Manzi, widowed and ultimately without citizenship. Over 10 years after her husband's declaration of intention, on October 4, 1924, Manzi using the declaration filed a petition for citizenship. She eventually did receive citizenship, and was fully naturalized on February 13, 1925, even over an objection from the government stating her petition was too late.\nOn January 9, 1926, John S. Murdock, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island filed a petition for the cancellation of Manzi's naturalization certificate on the grounds it had been \"illegally procured\". The District Court dismissed the case without an official opinion. The United States appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\nCourt of Appeals\nThe Court of Appeals heard the case, and as noted by the Court, Manzi neither filed a brief nor showed up for oral arguments, leaving the United States as the sole \"voice\" in the case. Despite this, in a majority opinion written by Judge Georgia W. Anderson, of which Judge George H. Bingham and Judge Charles F. Johnson concurred, the Court rejected the historical arguments raised by the United States. With this, the United States once again appealed, this time to the United States Supreme Court.\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJustice Edward C. McReynolds, who wrote the majority opinion.\nThe Supreme Court in this case granted certiorari, and held oral arguments on February 23, 1928, and handed down its decision on April 9. Justice James C. McReynolds wrote the majority opinion for the 7-9 Court in favor of the United States, with Justice George Sutherland and Justice Edward T. Sanford dissenting. The opinion reversed the judgement of the Court of Appeals in dismissing the United States' petition for a cancellation of Manzi's certificate of naturalization. Of note, Manzi once again failed to seek representation in this case for purpose of briefs or oral arguments.\nIn its opinion, the Court firstly promulgated its belief that an application for citizenship within a marriage is sort of a simultaneous process, and thus the husband and wife are both subject to the same regulations and restrictions as prescribed by naturalization law. The entirety of this case was based on the Naturalization Act of 1906 and its provisions. The specific provision in question is as follows:\"Section 2. Not less than two years nor more than seven years after he has made such declaration of intention, he shall make and file, in duplicate, a petition in writing...\nSection 6. When any alien who had declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States dies before he is actually naturalized, the widow and minor children of such alien may, by complying with the other provisions of this Act, be naturalized without making any declaration of intention.\"The court goes on to recognize the very specific requirements of the act, stating a widow may \"obtain naturalization without her personal declaration of intention,  she must comply with all other prerequisites.\" The Court seemingly wished to err on the side of caution when dealing with naturalization law, stating,\"Citizenship is a high privilege, and when doubts exist concerning a grant of it, generally, at least, they should be resolved in favor of the United States and against the claimant.\"\nDissent\nAlthough Justice Sutherland and Justice Sanford dissented, the published opinion did not contain a dissent in writing, nor any reasoning for why they dissented.\n",
    "Spanish engineer, businessman, and politician\nAlberto Lucas Ram\u00f3n Aznar Tutor (18 October 1864 \u2013 30 March 1923) was a Spanish engineer, businessman, and politician. He was a deputy for Marquina between 1920 and 1923.\nAznar was the first president of the Neguri Golf Club, a position he held until his death, and was a member of both the Real Club Mar\u00edtimo del Abra and Real Sporting Club of Bilbao, presiding over the former between 1906 and 1908 and the latter between 1910 and 1911. He was also the first Marquis of Zuya\u00a0, a noble title that he held from 1920 until 1923.\nEarly and personal life\nAlberto Aznar was born on 18 October 1864 in Bilbao, as the fourth of the seven children of Eduardo Aznar de la Sota (1830\u20131902), a ship interpreter broker (maritime brokerage) in Bilbao and a senator for the province of Burgos, and of his wife, Luisa Tutor Fuentes (1840\u20131893). His father was first associated with his uncle Alejandro de la Sota (1820\u20131909), only ten years older than him, and later with his eldest son, his first cousin Ramon de la Sota.\nIn 1897, he married Jesusa de la Puente Atristain in Bilbao, with whom he had five children, Emilio (1898\u20131950), Mar\u00eda de la Concepci\u00f3n (1900\u20131986), Luisa Mar\u00eda (1904\u20131992), Mar\u00eda Isabel (1904\u20131965), and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Aznar de la Puente (1905\u20131934).\nProfessional career\nAfter studying at the Vizca\u00edno Institute, Aznar obtained the title of industrial engineer in Barcelona in 1893, specializing in mechanics. When he returned to Bilbao, he joined the family mining business and, above all, the shipping business.\nIn March 1902, Alberto and his two older brothers Eduardo and Luis Mar\u00eda (1862\u20131929) formed the limited partnership A. Aznar y Compa\u00f1\u00eda, in which Alberto had 15 percent of the capital and 20 percent of the profits. When their father died without a will three months later on 15 June 1902, there were quarrels between his brothers, but in the end, all three inherited their father's political affiliation linked to monarchical conservatism. Furthermore, all three were deputies and senators of the Conservative Party, as well as important shipowners and industrialists of their time.\nIn the late 1890s, Alberto and his older brother Eduardo promoted the creation of other shipping companies: Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Vapor Alaveaga (1898) and Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Vapor Axpe (1899), which were followed shortly by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Navegaci\u00f3n Bat and the Vasco Cant\u00e1brica de Navegaci\u00f3n, with a capital of 1,250,000 pesetas. He was one of the promoters of the Asociaci\u00f3n de Navieros de Bilbao (Bilbao Shipping Association).\nIn 1917, Aznar became part of the first board of directors of the Altos Hornos del Mediterr\u00e1neo, and he was also briefly a member of the Banco of Bilbao, since the appointment was agreed on 8 March 1923.\nPolitical career\nIn 1896, Aznar was a provincial deputy for the district of Markina. A few years later, in 1918, he ran with a group of conservatives, but lost to Indalecio Prieto, a socialist, and Pedro Chalbaud, a leader. They made a monarchical unification against the nationalists and Alberto Aznar was elected deputy to the Cortes for Markina on the candidacy of the Monarchist Action League with 75% of the votes in 1920, a position that he held for three years until 6 April, a week after his death.\nAznar was a conservative and although he was very close to Antonio Maura, he did not participate in Maura's party, despite having a similar ideology. He was a supporter of the conservative monarchy, and in 1919, he was the founder of the Las Arenas monarchical circle.\nSporting career\nAznar was the first president of the Neguri Golf Club, a position he held until his death. In 1902, the 38-year-old Aznar and his older brother Luis Mar\u00eda were among the founding members of Real Club Mar\u00edtimo del Abra, being the no. 370 and 26 respectively. He was a member of both the Real Club Mar\u00edtimo del Abra and Real Sporting Club of Bilbao, presiding over the former between 1906 and 1908 and the latter between 1910 and 1911.\nDeath and legacy\nOn 20 December 1920, King Alfonso XIII granted him the aristocratic title of Marquis of Zuya by royal decree. His life was spent between Bilbao and Las Arenas, where he owned the Itsaosgane palace. At the end of the First World War, he was already living in Madrid, in Calle Almagro, where he died on 30 March 1923, at the age of 58. On the third anniversary of his death, the manifest mass of the chapel of Santo Cristo de la Salud on 29 March 1926, as well as all those celebrated on 30 March, were applied in the suffrage of his soul.\nNeither his son Emilio nor his eldest daughter Mar\u00eda de la Concepci\u00f3n had descendants, so when both died the noble title of Marquis of Zuya passed down to his third-born child on 3 September 1987, the 83-year-old Luisa Mar\u00eda, who died in 1993 and was then succeeded by her daughter Mar\u00eda de la Soledad Paloma Eulate y Aznar.\n",
    "Filipino judge (1920-1995)\nRamon Fernandez (February 16, 1916 - March 25, 1997) was a former associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. He was sworn in as a member of the Supreme Court by President Ferdinand Marcos on May 27, 1977, but resigned on May 11, 1982 after being involved in a scandal over the admission of the son of a fellow associate justice as a lawyer, in a case that also saw the resignation of the entire Supreme Court. \nBiography\nBorn in Libon, Albay on February 16, 1916, Fernandez obtained his pre-law degree and law degree from the University of the Philippines College of Law where he graduated in 1939.  He was a classmate of Ferdinand Marcos, who later appointed him to government positions during his presidency.\nHe taught law at the University of the Philippines, Manuel L. Quezon University, and the Philippine Law School before joining government as an undersecretary of the Department of Justice from 1968 to 1971. In 1977 he was appointed as an associate justice of the Supreme Court.\nResignation\nFernandez's tenure in the Supreme Court was cut short after he was implicated in a scandal over the conduct of the 1981 Philippine Bar Examinations that were overseen by the court. In March 1982, Associate Justice Ameurfina Melencio-Herrera publicly said that the mercantile law grades of Associate Justice Vicente Ericta's son Gustavo, who took the examination, was changed from 56 to 58 percent prior to publication of the test results to enable him to pass with a general average of 73 and become a fully-pledged lawyer. Chief Justice Enrique Fernando subsequently admitted ordering the revision in the younger Ericta's grade but denied allegations of unethical behavior, saying that it was done to correct an \"oversight\" by the examiner upon the advice of justices Ramon Aquino and Fernandez, who were prematurely shown Ericta's grades, and citing a similar predicament with one of his sons, who died shortly after passing the bar exam.\nFollowing public uproar and demands for their impeachment, all 14 members of the Supreme Court, including six justices who were not directly involved in the grade tampering, submitted their resignation to President Marcos on May 11. All of them were subsequently reappointed days later by Marcos, except for Ericta and Fernandez, who were both \"found responsible\" for the scandal by a group of former justices advising the president.\nDeath\nFernandez died in 1997.\n",
    "Spanish footballer\nAntonio Anguera Bernaus (17 February 1921 \u2013 1 September 1993) was a Spanish footballer who played as a Defender for UE Lleida and FC Barcelona.\nEarly life\nAntonio Anguera was born on 17 February 1921 in T\u00e9rmens, Lleida as the son of Antoni and Br\u00edgida, and began playing football in Lleida in 1933, at the age of just 12, in the Escola del Treball de Lleida\u00a0 (Lleida Labor School team). Despite quickly falling in love with this sport, his parents, who ran an awning business, did not view his son's hobby very favorably, but his father's first cousin, Enric Bernaus, was his number one fan.\nPlaying career\nEarly career\nAnguera played for the school team for three years until 1936, when the Spanish Civil War broke out. After the civil war ended in 1939, he joined the first team of L\u00e9rida Balompi\u00e9, which would later become UE Lleida, where he played the 1939\u201340 season, at the age of 18. There, he quickly stood out as a great defender and eventually drew the attention of RCD Espanyol, who called him for a test in Barcelona, where he stayed at his uncles' house, who lived on Valencia Street\u00a0. In the same building lived a person closely related to FC Barcelona and, when he found out about the boy's presence, he told him to go try out for Bar\u00e7a first, and they kept him, signing him in 1940, at 19 years old.\nFC Barcelona\nAnguera made his official debut for Barcelona in the opening game of the 1940\u201341 La Liga on 29 September, which ended in a humiliating 11\u20131 loss to Sevilla CF. He quickly established himself as an undisputed starter, since he always offered his best and gave everything for the Bar\u00e7a shirt. His promising career, however, was cut short on 9 February 1941 in Bala\u00eddos, where he received a severe blow to his Achilles' heel, a setback that did not prevent him from finishing the match, which Bar\u00e7a won 1\u20134, but it did leave him absent from the next one against Real Murcia, before reappearing against Real Madrid and also playing in the final match of the league season against Athletic Bilbao on 2 March 1941. Anguera also played three matches in the 1941\u201347 FEF President Cup, including a 1\u20131 draw with Valencia in which Mundo got a red card for an attempted attack on him.\nHowever, the annoyances were always there and they did not disappear. In the following season, 1941\u201342, Anguera did not play until the sixth matchday, against Real Sociedad in San Sebasti\u00e1n (2\u20130), but he had to take a step back after a match against Granada CF on 15 February 1942, which was his last official match. While at Bar\u00e7a, the club won the 1942 Copa del General\u00edsimo, but he did not contribute to the title since he did not play any cup match due to the discomfort he suffered. Before the matches in Les Corts, \"they warmed up on the way to the field, walking with a firm step and taking a carajillo in the bar before dressing in shorts\". In total, he played 37 official matches for Bar\u00e7a.\nIn Barcelona, he cultivated friendships with Manuel Rosal\u00e9n, Jos\u00e9 Bravo, and the presidents Marqu\u00e9s de la Mesa de Asta and Josep Vendrell.\nLater career\nAnguera had to have surgery, but his father told him to \"stop fooling around, to get to work\", but Anguera kept pursuing his passion and, with great pain, returned to L\u00e9rida Balompi\u00e9 in the 1942\u201343 season, although his injured heel only allowed him to line up in one match and he ended up retiring from football at the age of just 22.\nPlaying style\nFrom a hard-working family, Anguera transmitted these values on the field, protected by a well-built physique. Bernaus stated years later that Anguera \"was all nerve, speed, and sacrifice\".\nLater life\nAfter retiring, Anguera joined the awning business run by his father, who also had a small store where he sold bags, suitcases, wallets, purses, Et cetera. He lived in Lleida, but regularly went down to Barcelona to watch their matches. On one occasion, Anguera told Nicolau Casaus, then vice-president of Barcelona, that the ex-players should have a seat in the Camp Nou, since he wanted his grandchildren to know in which team his grandfather had played, but Casaus replied that if the board did that, they would have to expand the field.\nFond of hunting, he exhausted even the dogs, and \"sometimes he returned home burdened with how tired they were\".\nDeath\nIn May 1989, Anguera followed Barcelona by car to the 1989 European Cup Winners' Cup final in Bern with his cousins Josep, Francesc, and Llu\u00eds Bernaus, which Bar\u00e7a won 2\u20130. He died in Lleida five months later, on 1 September 1993 at the age of 72, the victim of an illness.\nIn July 2015, his widow, the 91-year-old Nati, was presented with the 'Great dictionary of Bar\u00e7a players', in which Anguera shines on page 32.\n",
    "Map of Byzantine Constantinople. The Lycus runs through the city from northwest to southThe Lycus (Greek: \u039b\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, romanized:\u00a0Lykos, lit. \"wolf\"; Turkish: Bayrampa\u015fa Deresi) is a stream, now vaulted over, that flowed in Constantinople (today's Istanbul), which was important for historical reasons. The only waterway present within the walled city, it was covered in the 1950s to build the Vatan Caddesi (now Adnan Menderes Vatan Caddesi) avenue.\nCourse\nConstantinople map from 1860-70 with the Lycus Valley in evidence within the historical peninsulaThe Lycus, which was six kilometers long, was the only drainage channel for the walled city.  The maximum width of the valley it formed was 3.5 km and occupied one-third of the area of Byzantine Constantinople.\nIts springs are located in the heights of the Top\u00e7ular neighborhood, in the northern part of the present-day Bayrampa\u015fa district, about 3.5 km northwest of the Edirne (Adrianople) Gate (Turkish: Edirne Kapi\u015fi) of the Theodosian walls. Geographically, the creek separated the seventh hill of the city (located to the west) from the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth. Administratively, it marked the boundary between the twelfth regio (located to the west) and the rest of the city.\nThe Lycus reached the walls of Constantinople between the gates of Carisius and St. Romanus (corresponding to modern Edirnekap\u0131 and Topkap\u0131), just south of the Fifth Military Gate, passed under the walls and entered the city. At that point a tower, now known as \"Sulukule,\" meaning \"water tower\", protected the river. The creek continued its course inside the walls, in a valley made fertile by the watercourse, named  for that reasonYenibahce (\"new garden\" in Turkish) by Turks. It headed southeast, passing south of Lips Monastery and reached the Forum Bovis. There it turned abruptly southward, touching the heights of Avretpazar, running just before its mouth through a plain called Aksaray (\"white palace\" in Turkish), perhaps after a building inhabited by Empress Irene in the early ninth century. The watercourse finally flowed into the Sea of Marmara at the Harbour of Theodosius, also called the Harbour of Eleutherios.\nThe Lycus valley near the walls with the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque in the background in a 1836 engraving\nAlthough the water regime of the watercourse was stream-like, and thus with little water for most of the year, the heavy rains that fell especially in February brought a lot of dirt into the stream, which flowed into the west and northwest parts of the harbor. To prevent the silting up of the southeastern part, a wall was therefore built that divided the harbor into two parts and acted as a barrier. Although the sheltered part of the harbor held out longer than the rest of the basin, it too was eventually filled in by sediment. Due to that, from the 12th-13th centuries the siltation caused by the creek gradually caused the harbor to disappear, creating in its place the area called Vlanga or Langabostan\u0131, which was used for vegetable cultivation until relatively recent times.\nHistory\nThe Lycus valley at the Theodosian walls looking north at the end of 19th century\nThe area of its estuary, originally a marsh and later then due to sea level rise a body of water, hosted a Neolithic settlement, and eventually the area became the Byzantine harbour of Theodosius.\nThe Lycus valley was never much inhabited in the Byzantine period, but it was a favored place for the settlement of Greek Orthodox monasteries: famous were those of Dios and Ikasia (or Cassia), Cocorobion and Lips. In 450, while hunting in the valley near Constantinople, Emperor Theodosius II (r.\u2009402\u2013450) fell from his horse and died. Ancient Ottoman maps of the city show that the lower course of the creek, south of the Lips monastery, had become a subterranean waterway. There are hints that these works were done during the Byzantine period. The section of the the city walls which crossed the valley in the north of the city, lower than the surrounding heights, was the weakest of the entire defensive circle, and in fact it was from there that the Ottomans penetrated the city on the morning of May 29, 1453.\nThe valley remained sparsely inhabited until Istanbul's explosive population increase, but then the area under vegetable gardens began to decline until it disappeared in the late twentieth century. In the period 1956-1957 a new road, the Vatan Caddesi (now Adnan Menderes Vatan Caddesi), was built directly over the riverbed, which was then covered over. The Lycus was briefly uncovered during the construction of the M1 subway line, which connects the city center to the Atat\u00fcrk Airport.\nNotes\n^ a b c d e f g h i Janin (1950), p. 12\n^ a b c d e \"Bayrampasa (Lykos) Deresi Havzas\u0131 ve A\u011fz\u0131ndaki Yenikap\u0131 (Theodosius Liman\u0131) Liman\u0131 K\u0131y\u0131 Alan\u0131ndaki (Marmara Denizi) De\u011fi\u015fim S\u00fcre\u00e7leri\" (in Turkish). 3 August 2010.

    "\nBrazil's new high school education system\nThe new Brazilian secondary education is a government educational policy instituted by Federal Law No. 13,415 of 2017, based on Provisional Measure No. 746 of 2016, which caused the secondary school reform. It aims to provide flexibility in the subjects taught to secondary school students in Brazil, establishing compulsory and optional disciplines. It also includes an increase in the workload over the years. Mendon\u00e7a Filho, then Minister of Education, believed that the reform would help combat school dropouts and encourage the expansion of full-time education. Critics claim that it will weaken basic education in Brazil.\nOn February 8, 2017, the Provisional Measure was approved in the Senate by 43 votes to 13; on February 16, it was sanctioned by President Michel Temer. The text divides the content of secondary education into 60% compulsory subjects, which will be defined by the Common National Curriculum Base (BNCC), and 40% optional subjects. Students must choose an area of interest among languages, mathematics, humanities, natural sciences and vocational education.\nSchools will have a deadline to increase their workload from 800 hours a year to 1,000 hours (or from four hours a day to five hours a day), in order to gradually implement full-time teaching. The annual workload must reach 1,400 hours, but there is no deadline for this.\nBackground\nIn 2013, a secondary school reform proposal by Reginaldo Lopes, a federal deputy from Minas Gerais affiliated to the Workers' Party (PT), was being discussed in the Chamber of Deputies under Bill No. 6.840. At the time, he claimed that the secondary school curriculum was outdated, had too many compulsory subjects and didn't recognize the individual differences of the students.\nDefinitions and objectives\nThe secondary school curriculum was defined by the Common National Curriculum Base (BNCC). The document is composed of 4 areas of knowledge plus 1 area of technical and vocational training. One of the aims of the project is to promote an increase in the workload in order to meet target 6 of the National Education Plan (PNE), which stipulates that 50% of schools and 25% of enrolments in basic education should be in full-time education by 2024.\nReception and repercussions\nMain article: 2016 student protests in Brazil\nHigh school students occupy school against reform in Brasilia.\nThe reform is considered controversial and has divided the opinions of educators. Students held large mobilizations across Brazil, especially in the states of Minas Gerais and Paran\u00e1, against the amendment. Deputy Thiago Peixoto (PSD-GO) stated that the protests were partly due to misinformation about the content of the provisional measure. One of the main points of praise for the proposal is that it makes subjects more flexible.\nDaniel Cara, general coordinator of the National Campaign for the Right to Education, is one of the main critics of the reform. A citizen from Rio Grande do Sul sent a bill to the Federal Senate via the e-Citizenship Portal suggesting that philosophy and sociology become compulsory subjects in high school. The suggestion was included by the Human Rights Commission in Bill No. 2579 of 2019.\nProtests against the new secondary education\nProtests to repeal the new secondary school system took place on March 15, 2023, in 56 cities across Brazil. The new format, which became compulsory in 2022, has been the target of much criticism, especially regarding the reduction in the workload of traditional subjects. The demonstrators, mostly secondary school students, called on the Lula government to repeal the current model, while the Minister of Education, Camilo Santana, admitted that it was necessary to make \"adjustments\".\nApplication schedule\nIn June 2021, the Ministry of Education announced the timetable for implementing the secondary school reform, which began in 2022 and ended in 2024, when the ENEM became aligned with the new format. After protests and criticism from students and civil organizations, the reform schedule was suspended for 90 days.\nSee also\nPresidency of Michel Temer\nBrazil labor reform\n2016 student protests in Brazil\nNotes\n^ Amends the National Education Guidelines and Bases Law of December 20, 1996, which establishes the guidelines and bases of national education, and Law No. 11494, of June 20, 2007, which regulates the Fund for the Maintenance and Development of Basic Education and the Valorization of Education Professionals, the Consolidation of Labor Laws (CLT) and Decree No. 236, of February 1, 1967.

It was coined by Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a visit to Heilongjiang in 2023 to promote manufacturing and innovation in the Chinese economy.\nHistory\nThe term was first mentioned by Chinese leader Xi Jinping during an inspection trip in Heilongjiang Province in September 2023, where he for a new economic model based on innovation in advanced sectors and for China to \"lead the development of strategic emerging industries and future industries\".\nFrom 11 to 12 December 2023, during the Central Economic Work Conference, Xi said the \"core of deepening supply-side structural reform is to promote industrial innovation through scientific and technological innovation, especially disruptive and cutting-edge technologies to spawn new industries, new models, new drivers, and develop new productive forces\".\nOn 5 March 2024, on the sidelines the second session of the 14th National People's Congress, Xi addressed deputies from Jiangsu Province, calling for local governments to develop new productive forces based on their local conditions in order prevent the formation of bubbles or adaptation of a single economic model. He also said \"developing new productive forces does not mean neglecting or abandoning traditional industries\" but rather to \"use new technologies to transform and upgrade traditional sectors and actively promote high-end, intelligent and green industries\". On the same day, the State Council listed new productive forces as a top priority in a government report.\nIn 2024, Xi'an University of Science and Technology established a \"New Quality Productive Forces Research Center\", to be led by university president Lai Xingping. From Xi's first mention of the term in September 2023 to 1 May 2024, the term appeared on Chinese academic database CNKI 1,073 times.\nOverview\nThe New York Times describes the focus on new productive forces as increasing innovation and economic growth by large investments in manufacturing, especially on high-tech and clean energy sectors, as well as more spending on research and development.\nIn March 2024, Xinhua News Agency said in contrast to \"traditional productive forces\" the new productive forces are an \"advanced productivity that plays a leading role in innovation and breaks away from the traditional economic growth mode and productivity development path\". It says it features \"high technology, high efficiency, and high quality\".\nState media has used it to refer to industries ranging from tourism to the \"new three\"; electric vehicles, batteries and renewable energy. Xi has said the test for new productive forces will be whether they will be able to generate improvements in total factor productivity. Xi also said the new productive forces will come from the application of science and technology to production. Study Times of the Central Party School called the term as a development of the theory of the productive forces from Marxism and said it further enriches Xi Jinping Though on Economics.\n",

Her autobiography sheds light on the experiences and difficulties she faced as a woman in the public eye, providing insight into the gender dynamics of 18th-century England and her own economic struggles. Originally published as a serial, Charke claims that the narrative is an attempt to reconcile with her father, who at the time of writing had disowned her. The book sold well and was republished several times.\nCharke was the daughter of the famous actor and playwright Colley Cibber and followed in his footsteps, spending much of her own life in the theater. Her narrative uses dramatic language and themes, allowing the sense of the theatre to be present in her autobiography as she takes on the role of different identities. However, much of her autobiography illustrates Charke's life off the stage, including her crossdressing. While she portrayed many breeches roles throughout her career in the theater, she often chose to cross dress under male identities in her daily life. Her autobiography documents the various occupations -sometimes male- that she assumed while crossdressing, her consistent economic deficiencies, multiple marriages, and the estrangement from her family and complications of her own.\nA notable aspect of the narrative style is its episodic format, which Charke claims to have chosen for specific entertainment and to gain public opinion on the episodes of her life that are implied to be the reason for Cibber's disownment of his daughter.

    "\nLivre pour quatuor (Book for quartet) is a composition for string quartet by Pierre Boulez.\nBackground\nThe bulk of Livre pour quatuor was composed during 1948\u20131949, immediately following completion of the Second Piano Sonata, and contemporary with the publication of the essay \"Proposals.\" Boulez's first instrumental piece without piano, it can be seen as marking a transition between the hyper-expressivity and reliance on traditional forms found in the earlier works, culminating in the Second Sonata, with the serial experiments that followed. In a 1950 letter to John Cage, Boulez acknowledged the influence of the older composer, stating: \"Meeting you made me end a 'classical' period with my quartet.\"\nSketches for Livre pour quatuor reveal Boulez's initial experiments with applying serial techniques to both pitch and rhythm. In an interview, he recalled that he \"began by using completely independent schemes in which pitches, durations and rhythms were combined at first starting from cells, but these cells became so independent that they virtually became rhythmic series.\" Boulez would continue these experiments in the works that followed, namely Polyphonie X, Deux \u00c9tudes for tape, and the first book of Structures.\nLivre pour quatuor was also the first of Boulez's compositions to reflect the influence of poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. Boulez noted that the idea for the quartet came to him while reading Mallarm\u00e9's Igitur and Un Coup de D\u00e9s, during which he came to see the poetry as forming \"a continuity from which sections could be detached because they had meaning and validity even when taken out of the continuous context in which they were placed.\" Boulez's quartet was initially conceived as a group of six separable movements, or \"feuillets\" (leaves), from which the performers would select the ones they wanted to play. (Although the quartet's title suggests an homage to Mallarm\u00e9's Livre, in which the pages could be read in any order, Boulez recalled that he did not read the poem until after its publication in 1957.) He would continue to explore such ideas in later works, such as the Third Piano Sonata.\nThe quartet remained in a state of flux for many years, as Boulez grappled with its technical and expressive challenges. Although he completed movements 1 (in two parts), 2, 3 (in three parts), and 5 by mid-1949, movement 6 was not completed until 1959, while movement 4 remained incomplete. He revised the piece in 1959 with the help of members of the Parrenin Quartet, and, during 2002\u20132012, he continue the revisions, working with the Diotima Quartet.\nOver the years, as Boulez attended performances of individual sections of the work, he grew dissatisfied with it due to the numerous performative challenges resulting from his inexperience at the time it was written. He concluded that it \"posed great interpretative problems for a quartet,\" and suggested that \"you would need a conductor to solve them.\" In the late 1960s, he withdrew the work from his catalogue, requesting that it no longer be performed except by quartets that had already rehearsed and played it, and began rewriting it for string orchestra. His recomposition of the two-part first movement became Livre pour cordes (1968), while rewrites of the remaining movements remained forever incomplete.\nMusic\nMusicologist Richard Toop observed that, in comparison with the works that preceded it, Livre pour quatuor lacks the \"explosive dynamism\" of the Second Piano Sonata as well as the \"seductive lyricism\" of Le Soleil des eaux. Boulez himself commented: \"The mere fact of using a string quartet brought with it a certain reticence, a certain restraint.\" On the other hand, the music is characterized by rapid timbral and dynamic changes, in conjunction with the use of a wide variety of string techniques (sul ponticello, pizzicato, col legno, etc.), as well as a tendency for the four instrumental voices to cross, blurring their traditional registral identities. Boulez also noted the contrast between passages that he characterized as \"austere\" and \"rigid\" with others that are more \"supple,\" and that produce \"an impression of flexibility and improvisation.\"\nPremiere and publication\nThe work was premiered in fragments, beginning on 15 October 1955, when the Marschner Quartet played movements 1 and 2 at a concert in Donaueschingen, Germany. Movements 5 and 6 were performed on 9 September 1961 in Darmstadt, Germany, by the Hamann Quartet, while the Parrenin Quartet played movements 3 in Darmstadt on 8 July 1962. Movements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were first performed together on 31 March 1985 by the Arditti Quartet. The score was published by Heugel.\nReconstruction of fourth movement\nIn 2018, at the invitation of violinist Irvine Arditti, composer Philippe Manoury and musicologist Jean-Louis Leleu worked together on reconstructing and finishing the incomplete fourth movement. The entire quartet, including the fourth movement, was premiered on 10 April 2018, by both the Arditti Quartet ",

    "Hypothetical primitive eukaryotes\nA mesokaryote or mesokaryotic organism is a single-celled eukaryote that shows intermediate resemblance to both prokaryotes and 'higher' eukaryotes. The term originates from a 1965 hypothesis by John David Dodge, who proposed that certain eukaryotes (mainly dinoflagellates) with closed mitosis and other traits considered 'primitive' were an intermediate step between prokaryotes and the remaining eukaryotes. This idea originated in the late 20th century, and was later disproven by more detailed ultrastructural studies in the following decades.\nHistory\nThe first investigations of the dinoflagellate nucleus, during the 1950s-1960s, revealed a fine nucleus and chromosome structure that was completely different from other nucleated organisms or eukaryotes, lacking histones and with a permanently condensed chromatin. Based on these findings, the phycologist John David Dodge proposed in 1965 the concept of Mesocaryota (or mesokaryotes) under the hypothesis that these features were an intermediate nuclear organization between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This hypothesis led to the theory that dinoflagellates were the first to evolve from the split with prokaryotes, followed by the remaining eukaryotes. The traits considered by Dodge to define Mesocaryota were: lack of detectable histones; absence of a mitotic spindle; continuous DNA synthesis; chromatin fibrils arranged in arched swirls as in bacterial nucleoids; and chromosomes permanently condensed persistently adhered to the nuclear envelope, which remains intact throughout mitosis (i.e., it is a closed mitosis).\nThe mesokaryote hypothesis was disproven in the following decades through more detailed observations of the criteria listed above. For example, detailed studies on the parasitic Syndinium demonstrated the presence of an unconventional type of basic histone-like proteins and of an extranuclear mitotic spindle in dinoflagellates, similarly to 'higher' eukaryotes. Dinoflagellates remained considered a group of ancient but true eukaryotes. With the improvement of molecular phylogenetics, dinoflagellates, like other groups that exhibited closed mitosis, were instead revealed to be derived, branching within the Alveolata, whose members have conventional nuclei. Thus, these traits were reinterpreted as highly derived. Due to its short lifespan, the mesokaryote hypothesis has had little impact.\n",

    "German historian\nMoraw in 2003\nPeter Moraw (31 August 1935 \u2013 8 April 2013) was a German historian.\nMoraw taught as Professor of Medieval History, German Regional History, and Economic and Social History at the University of Giessen for three decades until his retirement in 2003. His work in the second half of the 20th century considerably influenced German Late Middle Ages research. He is most renowned for his contributions to integrating theory-oriented social sciences and prosopography into medieval research, the turn towards court research oriented towards structural history, and a university history understood as social history. His late medieval volume, From an Open Constitution to a Designed Consolidation of the Propylaea, History of Germany, became a standard work in medieval studies.\nLife\nPeter Moraw was born on 31 August 1935 in the industrial city of Moravsk\u00e1 Ostrava in Czechoslovakia. Following the conclusion of the Second World War, he was compelled to flee his native Czechoslovakia and seek refuge with his parents in Heidelberg. He graduated from high school there in 1955. Like his father, he pursued a degree in history, German, and Latin at the Heidelberg University from 1955 to 1960, to become a teacher. He completed the state examination for teaching at grammar schools in 1960. From 1961 to 1971, he served as a research assistant at the Institute for Franconian-Palatinate History and Regional Studies at the University of Heidelberg. As outlined in a thesis by Bernd Schneidm\u00fcller, Moraw's Moravian homeland and his academic socialization in Heidelberg were pivotal in shaping his research interests in the Late Middle Ages. In Heidelberg, Moraw was influenced by Reinhart Koselleck, who opened up the perspective to cross-epochal questions and was open to interdisciplinary methods. Moraw named Werner Conze, Erich Maschke, Ahasver von Brandt , and Hermann Heimpel as the historians who influenced him. He received his doctorate under Fritz Ernst in 1961 at the age of 26 with a thesis on the St. Philipp Abbey in Zell in the Palatinate. Moraw had chosen this small and relatively insignificant abbey because its documents were in the Heidelberg University Archives and therefore on the floor below his study. By the standards of the time, the dissertation had a \"classical-land-historical approach\". His doctoral supervisor had already passed away by the time his dissertation was published. Moraw reoriented his methodological approach, expanding beyond conceptual history to encompass the history of individuals. He undertook a detailed study of Helmut Berve's Alexanderreich and the early works of the Tellenbach school. These works served as a catalyst for his development of a more nuanced understanding of pre-modern conditions, based on a prosopographical approach.\nIn the ten years between his dissertation and his habilitation, he was a habilitation fellow of the German Research Foundation (DFG), engaged for the first time with university history, translated central sources on the life and canonization of Hedwig of Silesia, and presented a map of the monasteries and convents with detailed explanations for the Palatinate Atlas of the Palatinate Society for the Advancement of Science. He completed his habilitation in medieval and modern history at the University of Heidelberg in 1971. His habilitation thesis, K\u00f6nig, Reich und Territorium im sp\u00e4ten Mittelalter (King, Empire and Territory in the Late Middle Ages), which was almost 1,000 typewritten pages long (818 pages of text and 172 pages of notes and bibliography), remained unpublished. Nevertheless, this work provided sufficient material for several pioneering studies in which he examined various aspects, including the councils and the chancellery of King Rupert of the Palatinate or the court, the council and the chancellery of Charles IV. He delivered his habilitation lecture on 17 July 1971, at the University of Heidelberg on the subject of Hessian collegiate churches in the Middle Ages. In 1971, Moraw assumed a position as a deputy professor of medieval history at the Technical University of Darmstadt.\nIn 1972, he was appointed Professor of General History with a focus on the auxiliary historical sciences at the Bielefeld University, where the history department was dedicated to the theoretical foundations of its own discipline. From the summer semester of 1973, Moraw succeeded Franti\u0161ek Graus as Professor of Medieval History and German Regional History with a particular emphasis on economic and social history at the University of Giessen. From 1973 to 1980, he collaborated closely with Volker Press, an early modern scholar, at the University of Giessen. At the beginning of the 1980s, Moraw, Press, and the sociologist Helge Pross offered courses at the University of Giessen, a notable occurrence at the time.\nHe declined appointments to D\u00fcsseldorf, Trier (1976) and T\u00fcbingen (1981). From 1979 to 1980 and again from 1997 to 1998, he served as Dean of the Dep",
    "A bronze statue of a pig in the Villa of the Papyri, the centre of a circle of Epicureans led by Philodemus of Gadara.\nLatin phrase meaning \"A pig from the herd of Epicurus\".\nThe Latin phrase Epicuri de grege porcum (literally, \"A pig from the herd of Epicurus\") was a phrase first used by the Roman poet Horace. The phrase appears in an epistle to Albius Tibullus, giving advice to the moody fellow poet:\nEpicurus was an Ancient Greek philosopher who taught that pleasure was the natural aim of man (as well as of all living things). From the beginning, Epicureans were keen to extol man's pleasure above that of the beasts. For Epicurus, man alone had the pleasures of friendship and philosophy; indeed, philosophy gave man the important ability to drive out empty or unnatural desires. The Epicurean philosopher Lucretius, in his De rerum natura, compared primitive men to \"hairy boars\" in their unhappiness. Only humans had the ability to cooperate and form societies which fostered pleasure. Philodemus of Gadara forcefully rebutted arguments that the animals, since they did not know of the Gods, were happier than humans (who fretted constantly of the Gods' existence). Animals, he alleged, had such anxieties but lacked the capacity of reason and therefore could not dispel them (as the Epicureans had succeeded at doing).\nNonetheless, the Epicurean philosophy lent itself to uncharitable comparisons to the basest of animals. Epicurus's contemporary Timon of Phlius labelled him the \"most piggish, most doggish\" philosopher. A silver cup of 30 AD uncovered at Boscoreale depicts Epicurus discoursing on pleasure as a greedy pig jumps up to steal food from the cooking pot. Plutarch's humorous dialogue Gryllus has Odysseus debate with one of his men whom Circe has turned into a pig. The pig convinces him that, immune to unnatural desires and free from false beliefs, his new species's virtue and happiness is much greater than that of Odysseus's.\nSome Epicureans, like Horace, embraced this symbol. The pig was already a symbol of ataraxia (imperturbability) for the followers of Pyrrho, so did not have solely negative connotations. The Villa of the Papyri, the centre of a circle of Epicureans led by Philodemus, featured a large bronze statue of a pig on its hind legs.\n",

    "Demonstration in Eugene, Oregon, U.S.\nOn April 29, 2024, approximately 100 University of Oregon students established a camp on the Eugene campus to support Palestinians in Gaza and demanding action from administrators. As part of the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses, demonstrators requested for the university to divest from \u201cthe state of Israel, Israeli companies, and any weapons or surveillance manufacturing.\u201d\nBackground\nFurther information: Israel\u2013Hamas war protests in the United States\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses.\nPro-Palestinian protests on university campuses escalated in April 2024, spreading in the United States and other countries, as part of wider Israel\u2013Hamas war protests. The escalation began after mass arrests at the Columbia University campus occupation, led by anti-Zionist groups, in which protesters demanded the university's disinvestment from Israel over its alleged genocide of Palestinians. On May 7, protests spread across Europe with mass arrests in the Netherlands. As of May 12, 20 encampments have also been established in the United Kingdom, and across universities in Australia and Canada. Some protesters have referred to the movement as the \"student intifada\".\nTimeline\nMay 1\nOn May 1, the University of Oregon president, Karl Scholz, made a statement regarding the encampment. While explicitly supporting the student right to protest and exchange ideas, he criticized protester demands for divestment as having a \"performative aspect.\" Despite this, 74 university faculty and staff have signed an open letter in support of the encampment.\nMay 5\u20136\nBy May 5, the encampment had grown to nearly 150 tents. On the afternoon of May 6, encampment spokespersons alleged that they had received a letter from university administrators threatening to revoke academic amnesty from protesters should the camp remain the following day at noon. This came amidst complaints from some Jewish students among whom the encampment had caused discomfort. In response to this, one protester stated that the demonstration calls for formal protection for Jewish students, and that Jewish student-represented organizations such as Jewish Voice for Peace have helped in setting up the encampment.\nSee also\nOregon portal\n2024 Portland State University pro-Palestinian campus occupation\nList of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in the United States in 2024\nNotes\n^ The Arabic term intifada means roughly \"uprising\" and is often used in the context of Palestinian uprisings in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n",
    "\nChemical compound\nStrontium carbide (also more precisely known as strontium acetylide or strontium dicarbide) is a salt with chemical formula SrC2.  It was first synthesized by Moissan in 1894.\nStrontium carbide can be formed in an electric arc furnace from strontium carbonate and a reductant, such as a reducing sugar or magnesium metal.  Alternatively, carbothermal reduction of strontium oxide with graphite begins around 150\u00a0\u00b0C and is catalyzed by calcium oxide.  Classical organic chemistry syntheses include transmetallation from mercury acetylide or an acid-base reaction between dibenzylstrontium and acetylene, although these techniques often produce complexes with the solvent.  Direct formation from the elements has a notional enthalpy of -20\u00a0kcal/mol.\nNevertheless, strontium carbide may be only metastable when encapsulated in a fullerene.   It slowly hydrolyzes in air to acetylene.\nThe material is polymorphic, forming a monoclinic crystal structure akin to calcium carbide II and a black tetragonal phase.  Heated to 370\u00a0\u00b0C, it reversibly converts to a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice. Yttrium carbide retains the fcc lattice down to room temperature; the difference is a 3eg orbital that strontium lacks the electrons to fill. Cyanamide impurities stabilize one other strontium carbide polymorph, just as they do for calcium carbide.  The stabilized calcium carbide polymorph is triclinic, and the strontium carbide polymorph is believed to be so as well.\nAt roughly 1800\u00a0\u00b0C, strontium carbide melts.  It forms a solid solution with europium carbide, as Eu2+ has an almost identical ionic radius to Sr2+.\nStrontium carbide is a chemical intermediate in an archaic carbon-14 dating technique: burning the material to be dated releases carbon dioxide, trapped as strontium carbonate.  Magnesium then reduces the carbonate to strontium carbide and hydrolysis releases acetylene.  The radioactive decay of the acetylene can then be observed directly or heating to 600\u00a0\u00b0C polymerizes the acetylene to benzene for a liquid scintillator.\nSolid state metathesis of strontium carbide and a (complex) metal oxide gives the corresponding metal carbide and strontium oxide.  The latter washes away easily in pure water.\n",
    "\nPublic dance school in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo School of Dance (Portuguese: Escola de Dan\u00e7a de S\u00e3o Paulo - EDASP), also known as the S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Theater Dance School (Escola de Dan\u00e7a do Theatro Municipal de S\u00e3o Paulo - EDTMSP) or the Municipal Ballet School (Escola Municipal de Bailado), is located in the Brazilian city of S\u00e3o Paulo. It is linked to the training center of the S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Theater Foundation.\nCurrently run by Cristiana de Souza, the school is based in Pra\u00e7a das Artes and caters to around 800 students. It is one of the most traditional dance schools in Brazil and has trained generations of artists.\nHistory\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo School of Dance was inaugurated on May 2, 1940, under the administration of Mayor Francisco Prestes Maia, as the Experimental School of Classical Dance (Escola Experimental de Dan\u00e7a Cl\u00e1ssica). The aim was to establish an amateur corps de ballet focused on romantic classical ballet in order to meet the choreographic demands of the national and foreign operatic productions at the S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Theater. In the first month, the group premiered the opera Aida.\nIt operated in one of the rooms at the Municipal Theater. In 1943, the school was transferred to the lower level of the Viaduto do Ch\u00e1 due to the need for more space to accommodate the growing number of students. Initially, it offered a course in Classical Dance for Children and Young People. In 1952, Musical Initiation and Dance History were added. In 1957, Decree No. 3,431 regulated the 8-year training course.\nIn the 1970s, it became known as the Municipal Ballet School (Escola Municipal de Bailado) and included Modern Dance as a language of expression. At the beginning of the 1980s, a new teaching program focusing on dance awareness, both physically and intellectually, was created. Decree No. 21.988 of 1986 established the Municipal Youth Dance Corps, which provided a unique artistic development opportunity for the school's students. Decree No. 30.593 of 1991 introduced the subjects of Music, Art History, Modern Technique and Improvisation into the curriculum.\nIn 1987, J\u00e2nio Quadros, then mayor of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, abolished the course and banned homosexuals from entering the school. After criticizing the measure, Klauss Vianna, a dancer and former director of the school, was attacked in front of his house. In 2011, it was renamed S\u00e3o Paulo School of Dance (Escola de Dan\u00e7a de S\u00e3o Paulo) after the creation of the S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Theater Foundation. Since 2014 it has been based in the Pra\u00e7a das Artes building.\nSee also\nTourism in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo\n",

    "Aromanian cultural organization in Romania\nThe Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society (Romanian: Societatea de Cultur\u0103 Macedo-Rom\u00e2n\u0103, SCMR) is an Aromanian cultural organization in Romania. It was founded on 23 September 1879, succeeding the Macedo-Romanian Committee established in 1860. The SCMR has the aim of preserving and developing the Aromanian language and culture, and it has had a highly relevant impact on the history of the Aromanians. The society receives support from the Romanian state and regards the Aromanians as ethnic Romanians with specific characteristics that are to be preserved.\nHistory and activities\nThe Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society was founded on 23 September 1879, being the oldest Aromanian cultural organization. It was recognized as a legal entity by Princely Decree No. 1289 issued by Prince of Romania Carol I on 15 April 1880. The SCMR succeeded the Macedo-Romanian Committee (Romanian: Comitetul Macedo-Rom\u00e2n), founded in 1860 in Bucharest in the United Principalities at the initiative of the immigrant Aromanian historian Dimitrie Cozacovici and under the patronage of Prince of Moldavia and Wallachia Alexandru Ioan Cuza.\nThe SCMR aims to preserve and cultivate the Aromanian language, culture, specific traditions and identity, including among the young generation. It promotes contacts and cultural ties with Aromanian communities everywhere and with the other peoples together with whom the Aromanians live. A nonprofit organization, the organization receives material and moral support from the Romanian state, having been legally recognized in the country as an association of public utility on 7 May 2008. The SCMR supports the traditional notion in Romania that the Aromanians are ethnic Romanians with some distinct particularities that should be preserved. It has the power to issue documents certifying civil status, including nationality certificates to help Aromanians obtain Romanian citizenship with considerably less bureaucratic effort.\nThe SCMR, together with the Romanian state itself, funded and supported the schools and publications for the Aromanians from which many renowned writers and creators of Aromanian literature emerged. It also supported churches for the Aromanians and printed and distributed manuals and worship books in both Aromanian and Romanian for free to support these institutions. The society published Albumul macedo-rom\u00e2n (\"The Macedo-Romanian Album\"), founded in 1880 by the Romanian historian, academic and politician V. A. Urechia. It also published the weekly Revista Macedoniei (\"Macedonia's Magazine\"), which later merged with Rom\u00e2nul de la Pind.\nThe society played an important role in the emission of the ir\u00e2de-i seniyye (\"spoken will\") on 22 May 1905 by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II that recognized the Ullah millet and thus gave the Aromanians the status of a separate ethnolinguistic group within the Ottoman Empire with its own specific rights. It also initiated the Meglenia Cultural Society for the Megleno-Romanians, which had similar objectives to the SCMR. The SCMR stopped its activities in 1948, without being formally disbanded. It was reactivated following the Romanian revolution in December 1989 after which several other cultural organizations of the Aromanians in Romania were also established. In 2019, the National Bank of Romania issued a commemorative coin for the 140th anniversary of the SCMR's founding.\nNotable members of the SCMR's board of directors have included Vasile Alecsandri, Dimitrie Br\u0103tianu, Ioan D. Caragiani, Ion I. C\u00e2mpineanu, Dimitrie Ghica, Ion Ghica, Titu Maiorescu, Iacob Negruzzi, C. A. Rosetti, Christian Tell and the aforementioned Urechia. Also relevant for the society's founding were Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu and Calinic Miclescu\u00a0. As of 2020, the president of the society was the Romanian Aromanian actor, director and politician Ion Caramitru.\nSee also\nList of Aromanian cultural organizations\n",
    "Municipal building in Haverhill, Suffolk, England\nHaverhill Arts Centre, formerly Haverhill Town Hall, is a former municipal building in the High Street in Haverhill, Suffolk, a town in England. The building, which is currently used as an events centre, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe building was commissioned by Daniel and Caroline Gurteen, who were the proprietors of a textile manufacturing business at Chauntry Mills in Haverhill, as part of celebrations for their 50th wedding anniversary. The site they selected was on the southwest side of the High Street, close to Haverhill South railway station. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 11 April 1882. It was designed by Edward Sharman of Wellingborough in the Gothic Revival style, built in red brick with stone dressings at a cost of \u00a35,000 and was officially opened as Haverhill Town Hall on 2 August 1883.\nThe building had a large hall on the first floor, while the ground floor accommodated a kitchen, toilets, and rooms for lectures, committee meetings, chess and billiards.  It also included a council chamber and the town's public library.  In May 1884, a large organ, designed and manufactured by James Jepson Binns, was installed in the hall. The hall was known for its public dances in the 1950s and 1960s, and for bingo and an annual pantomime in the 1970s and 1980s.  In the early 1990s, it was owned by the St Edmundsbury Borough Council, which converted it into an arts centre and re-opened it as such on 1 December 1994.\nIn 2004, control of the building passed to Haverhill Town Council.  In 2023, the arts centre initiated a self-produced pantomime for the first time: the production of Dick Whittington was written and directed by the centre's creative director, Dan Schumann, and starred the actor, Scott Wright. The building also houses the Haverhill Local History Museum, which has a collection of local memorabilia.\nArchitecture\nThe building is constructed of red brick, with dressing of stone and glazed tile.  It has two storeys and an attic, with a slate roof.  Its main front is three bays wide, and has a projecting three-stage porch rising the full height of the building and surmounted by a gable. There is an arched opening with a hood mould in the first stage, an oriel window in the second stage and a tri-partite arched window with cusped heads and tracery in the third stage. The outer bays are fenestrated by pairs of windows with cusped heads. The side walls each have seven windows.  As built, there were also dormer windows, later removed.  The building was grade II listed in 1973.\n",

It operated until mid-December 1944, and in a residual form, until 16 January 1945. During this period, between 390,000 and 410,000 people passed through Dulag 121, among whom tens of thousands were deported to forced labor in the depths of the Reich or sent to concentration camps after a short stay in the camp. Due to diseases, exhaustion, or at the hands of guards, hundreds to several thousand prisoners of Dulag 121 perished. However, over 30,000 people managed to leave the camp thanks to the assistance of the Polish personnel employed there.\nOrigins\nThe transit camp in Pruszk\u00f3w was established on the sixth day of the Warsaw Uprising (6 August 1944). It was created based on the order of SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski (the commander of German forces designated to suppress the uprising), which was agreed upon two days earlier with the administrative authorities of the General Government. The first transport of expelled Warsaw residents arrived at the camp on August 7. It included about 5,000 survivors of the Wola massacre who were first gathered in the church of St. Adalbert and then driven on foot to Pruszk\u00f3w.\nThe establishment of the Pruszk\u00f3w camp was associated with a change in German plans regarding the fate of the inhabitants of the rebellious Warsaw. On the evening of 5 August 1944, Bach partially revoked Hitler's order from August 1, which commanded the total extermination of the city's inhabitants regardless of age or sex. Bach prohibited his units from killing women and children but maintained the order to eliminate all Polish men, both captured insurgents and civilians. This decision was not so much motivated by humanitarian concerns as by pragmatic calculation. Bach quickly realized that mass murders only increased the Poles' will to resist, and German soldiers engaged in killings, rape, and looting were unable to conduct offensive actions against the insurgents. Moreover, from the very beginning, he intended to suppress the uprising through a combination of political and military factors, fearing that the use of purely coercive measures would prevent him from achieving the main goal \u2013 namely, the rapid elimination of the dangerous hotspot behind the Eastern Front, which Warsaw engulfed in rebellion. On August 12, Bach further softened Hitler's order by issuing a prohibition on the killing of Polish civilian men. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, the economic aspect was also taken into account at that time. At this stage of the war, the Third Reich could not afford to waste such a large reservoir of potential labor. Therefore, extermination was replaced by the complete displacement of Warsaw's population. Contrary to official assurances that the aim of the displacement action was solely to ensure the safety of civilians by removing them from the front zone, the Germans were only interested in exploiting refugees as slave labor and plundering and destroying the city itself. According to the new guidelines, Dulag 121 camp in Pruszk\u00f3w was to serve as a transit camp for the displaced population of Warsaw. After a short stay in the camp, people fit for work were to be sent to farms, industrial plants, and camps in the Reich.\nDulag 121 was organized on the premises of the Railway Rolling Stock Repair Works located in the \u017bbik\u00f3w district of Pruszk\u00f3w. Several factors spoke in favor of choosing this location. In the fall of 1939, a transit camp for Polish prisoners of war was operational on the premises of the works, with a capacity of 2,000 people at that time. Later (from 20 January 1941), a labor camp for Jews was located there for a while. Thanks to this, in 1944, there were still elements of protective infrastructure (bunkers, guard towers) on the premises that could be adapted for the needs of the new camp. This place was also chosen due to its favorable location \u2013 a short distance from the capital and a convenient position on the railway line from Warsaw to Skierniewice, which allowed for efficient \"unloading\" of the camp. Dulag 121 was organized and supplied by the civilian administration of the General Government, but Bach exerc",
    "\nThe Hiawatha impact structure is a probable impact structure discovered beneath the Hiawatha Glacier in northwest Greenland, from which it gets its name. It was identified using airborne radar surveys that showed the presence of a crater-like depression in the bedrock beneath the ice. Shocked quartz grains and melt rock clasts have been found in fluvio-glacial sediments deposited by a river that drains the area of the structure. The timing of the impact has been dated using argon-argon dating and uranium-lead dating of zircon crystals within the melt rock to 57.99 \u00b1 0.54 million years ago, during the late Paleocene.\nDiscovery\nIn 2016 airborne radar surveys were acquired by the Alfred Wegener Institute to investigate the morphology of the bedrock surface beneath the ice. The results of this dataset were combined with existing data acquired by NASA as part of their Program for Arctic Regional Climate Assessment and Operation IceBridge. A circular depression was evident in the bedrock surface, which coincides closely with a circular feature on the ice surface. Fieldwork was also carried out at the margin of the ice sheet in the summer of 2016 and evidence of an impact structure was found in sediment samples taken from the river draining the crater.\nMorphology\nThe circular depression is about 31 km across and has a well-defined rim. The rim-to-floor depth is about 320 m and a broad central uplift has been identified with a prominence of 50 m. Two sub-glacial channels cut through the southeastern rim becoming poorly defined within the depression, before a single channel cuts the northwestern rim, carrying the outflow river.\nEvidence of origin\nApart from the clearly-defined circular depression, the identification of the feature as an impact structure is based on field samples taken from fluvio-glacial sediments from the outwash deposits of the river that drains the crater. Initial samples from the 2016 fieldwork contained shocked quartz grains with multiple planar deformation features (PDFs). The observed orientation of the PDFs is consistent with a high pressure origin. Further analysis of samples taken in 2019 identified clasts of melt rock, containing shocked zircon grains.\nDating\nArgon-argon dating was used on quartz grains found in samples of fluvio-glacial sand. Grains were identified as probable melted quartz based on shape and colour. The resulting Ar-Ar age spectra gave saddle-shaped patterns for 29 out of the 50 grains. No well-developed plateau were seen in any of the samples but two gave \"mini-plateaus\" indicating Late Paleocene ages, consistent with the saddles from the other samples.\nUranium-Lead dating was used on both undeformed and shocked zircon grains found within the identified melt rock clasts sampled during field work in 2019. Undeformed Zircons gave ages generally consistent with the age of the regional basement geology, which is mainly Paleoproterozoic. The shocked zircons show clear evidence of being affected by a younger event, with an overall discordant age distribution, interpreted as partial resetting with a well-developed concordant plateau at the younger ages, indicating an age of about 58 million years ago for the impact.\nInitial interpretations of the crater having a much younger age, during the Pleistocene led to it being associated with the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. The Late Paleocene age is not directly associated with any clear climatic effects.\nImpactor\nThe nature of the impactor responsible for the observed impact structure has been derived from field samples, which suggest that the asteroid responsible was a strongly fractionated iron type. For the size of crater observed, an impactor of about 1.5 km across is indicated.\n",
    "Guatemalan artist\nRosa Elena Curruchich (1958\u20132005) was a Maya Kaqchikel visual artist who was born in San Juan Comalapa, Guatemala. Her work was represented in the 60th Venice Biennale.\nCareer\nThe primary focus on her work deals with the role of women in Indigenous social milieux. According to the Archives of American Art's special archive of women artists research & exhibitions, many researchers consider her to be San Juan Comalapa's first woman painter. Her paintings have been described as \"detailed and precise\"; some of the subjects of her paintings include religious festivals, traditional customs, weaving and other artisanal practices. Curruchich began exhibiting her art in 1979 after teaching herself to paint earlier in that decade. Her first exhibition took place in Guatemala City and sold out quickly. After returning to her home, however, she was attacked by a group that believed her success \"might actually take some of the capacity for earning money away from them.\" During the Guatemalan Civil War she painted on a small scale so as to easily and discreetly transport them. The miniature scale also allowed her to paint in secret. Each of her works include written text that describes the activities depicted in the painting.\nExhibitions\nIn 1979, Curruchich work premiered at the French Institute in Guatemala City. Her early work documented and reclaimed \"the affective and political value of the parts of social life not often represented by male painters.\"\nIn addition to the Venice Biennale, Curruchich's work has been shown at the Kunsthalle Wien in Vienna. It has received critical attention from Artforum magazine, in addition to other publications. Miguel A. Lopez has written. \"Her work reveals the personal history and the way in which Indigenous women practise political actions through communal work, setting it apart from liberal, Western feminism.\"\nPersonal life\nCurruchich was the granddaughter of Andr\u00e9s Curruchich who was an important Chapin painter.\nCurruchich died in January of 2005 from diabetes complications.\nCollections\nCurruchich's work is held in the collection of the Museum of International Folk Art.\n",

He was canonized as a saint in the Orthodox Church on 14 April 2022.\nLife\nElder Evmenios Saridakis was born Constantine Saridakis on 1 January 1931 in Ethia in the province of Monofatsi in Heraklion, Crete to George and Sofia Saridakis. Because he was the eighth and last child, and because of the Nazi occupation of Crete, Constantine did not receive an education. In 1951, he entered the monastery of the Great Martyr Niketas near his village and in three years was tonsured a monk at the age of seventeen with the name Sophronios.\nIn 1954, the monk Sophronios was drafted into the Greek military. After some time, he was diagnosed with leprosy and transferred to Thessaloniki and then to the suburbs of Athens to the St. Barbara Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Athens. Fr. Sophronios recovered fully but decided to remain at the hospital to tend to the other lepers. He remained there for the rest of his life, eventually becoming the spiritual father of the lepers.\nSaint Nikephoros the Leper was transferred to the Athens hospital in 1957 and became the spiritual father of Fr. Sophronios until his repose in 1964. In 1975 at the age of forty-four Fr. Sophronios was ordained a priest with the name Evmenios. In 1992, Fr. Evmenios was awarded the rank of archimandrite and on 23 May 1999 he reposed. He was buried in the village where he was born.\nAttestation of Saint Porphyrios\nSaint Porphyrios of Kafsokalyvia, who sometimes went to Fr. Evmenios for confession, called him a \u201chidden saint of our days\" and said that \"he prays to God that he not be revealed to others but only at the end of his life will it be revealed.\" Furthermore, St. Porphyrios said, \"Go and receive the blessing of Elder Evmenios, because he is the hidden Saint of our days.

    "French photographer\nMadame Vaud\u00e9-Green (n\u00e9e Marie Melina Grin) (3 June 1822 - 9 June 1902) was a French photographer who worked in Paris in the 1850s and 1860s, specialising in photographs of religious art.\nEarly life\nMarie Melina Grin was born in Troyes, France on 3 June 1822, the daughter of Marie Rosalie Duparcq and Joseph Pierre Grin, a postal inspector. In 1848, she married Louis \u00c9douard Vaud\u00e9, a banker in Troyes. Following their marriage, the couple used the surname Vaud\u00e9-Grin or Vaud\u00e9-Grinn as well as Vaud\u00e9-Green.\nPhotographic career\nIn 1855, the press reported the arrival of a new photography studio in Paris, called Photographie catholique, owned by \"Monsier Vaud\u00e9-Green\" and specialising in the \"reproduction sur papier des chefs-d\u2019\u0153uvre de la peinture religieuse\" (the paper reproduction of masterpieces of religious painting). The prints produced included reproductions of Peter Paul Rubens, Fra Bartolomeo and Nicolas Poussin, which were offered for sale at affordable cheap prices.\nA later article explains how the studio operated: \"The artists in the new studio are two ladies, Madame Vaud\u00e9-Green and one of her relatives. They take the negatives themselves and produce the positives with truly remarkable skill. Their main aim was to apply photography to works of religious art and to reproduce as accurately as possible the beautiful compositions that had inspired the great masters (...) If it was not possible for them to work on the painting themselves, Madame Vaud\u00e9-Green copied the most famous engravings.\" Madame Vaud\u00e9-Green was soon the only person to be mentioned in publicity material, neither her husband or relative appear after this time. Her high level of technical skill was remarked upon positively. Her Paris studio at this time was at 8 rue de Milan, in the 9th arrondissement of Paris.\nIn 1856, Vaud\u00e9-Green presented a large number of reproductions of engravings in Paris. More than two hundred religious works were offered in two different formats and sold by Parisian stationers and print shops. The press was effusive, with the quality and finesse of her work admired. Her work and role in popularising religious art among the general public was highlighted. This included a journalist in the English magazine Photographic Notes suggesting that one day photography might provide pleasant and profitable employment for many young girls otherwise destined to become overworked domestic workers or seamstresses. La Lumi\u00e8re magazine praised \"the considerable work accomplished by Mme Vaud\u00e9-Green and the intelligence with which she has chosen the finest gems in this magnificent jewel box of masterpieces\".\nThe same year, Vaud\u00e9-Green took part in the Exposition des arts industriels de Bruxelles de 1856 (Brussels Industrial Arts Exhibition), where she was awarded a medal, alongside fellow photographers Charles N\u00e8gre and Nadar Jeune. In 1859, she took part in the third exhibition of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de photographie, where she showed reproductions of paintings, including a drawing after Paolo Veronese's The Wedding at Cana, and an interior view of a palace. The prints were created using a camera lens with a centralising cone, patented by Jamin in 1855. The critical reception was more mixed.\nAt the same time Vaud\u00e9-Green moved her studio to 36, rue d'Orl\u00e9ans-Batignolles, in Batignolles (later known as rue Legendre).\nBetween 1861 and 1863, she was involved in a dispute with Alphonse Bernoud, a French photographer living in Italy and a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de photographie, who had used her professional services. The issue in question was whether or not Vaud\u00e9-Green had reproduced old paintings from the original, or re-photographed modern images. After this dispute, she stopped working as a photographer.\nMelina Vaud\u00e9-Green, died at the age of eighty on 9 June1902 in M\u00e2con, her husband having predeceased her.\nSuccessors\nAround 1863, Vaud\u00e9-Green's studio was taken over by another woman photographer, Jeanne Laplanche who, with her architect husband Saint-Ange Laplanche, was based next door at 34, rue d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans-Batignolles. The name Photographie catholique was retained. After the street was renamed, the studio's address became 87 rue Legendre.\nFew traces remain of Laplance's work, apart from some photo-cards and a series of views of the Maison pomp\u00e9\u00efenne of Prince J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on on Avenue Montaigne, kept at the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet.\nAround 1870, Jeanne Laplanche in turn sold the studio.

    "Dam in the river Esla, province of Zamora, Castile and Le\u00f3n, Spain\nDam in Zamora, Castile and Le\u00f3n\nThe Ricobayo Dam (in Spanish: presa de Ricobayo or salto de Ricobayo) is a hydroelectric engineering work built on the lower course of the Esla river. It is located less than 1\u00a0km from Ricobayo de Alba, in the province of Zamora, Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Spain.\nThe section in which it is located is known as the arribes of Esla, a deep geographic depression caused by the millenary erosion of the river.\nIt is part of the Saltos del Duero system together with the infrastructures installed in Aldead\u00e1vila, Almendra, Castro, Saucelle and Villalcampo.\nHistory\nThe first project dates from 1919, although the projected height and capacity of the reservoir were lower. Soon the engineers of the Sociedad Hispano Portuguesa de Transportes El\u00e9ctricos realized that the flows of the Esla river were capable of creating the largest reservoir in Europe at that time (1200 hm\u00b3) with a large regulating capacity that would allow winter water to be stored. This is why in the Agreement of August 11, 1927, signed between Spain and Portugal to regulate the hydroelectric exploitation of the international section of the Douro River, Article 11 stipulates: \"The works to be carried out in Spanish territory, directly aimed at the regulation of the Douro in its international section, referred to in Article 10 of the Royal Decree-Law of August 23, 1926, will begin with the construction, on the Esla River, of the dam called Ricobayo, province of Zamora\".\nWork began in May 1929. The new Ricobayo Dam will regulate the flow of the Esla River and supply electricity to the north of Spain. It was put into operation in January 1934 with an installed power of 100 MW, which in 1947 will be increased to 133 MW. Notwithstanding the above, the official date of the start of operation is February 4, 1935, which is the date recorded by the Government in official documents.\nDuring the construction of the dam, the village of Salto del Esla was built to house the workers who participated in its construction. Some of these houses are still inhabited.\nIts construction led to the stone by stone transfer of the Visigothic temple of San Pedro de la Nave to the town of El Campillo.\nIt was granted a concession period of 75 years from 1935 when it began to operate, so that in 2010 the infrastructure should be handed over to the State. In 1990, Iberdrola presented a new reform and expansion plan that would add to the existing plant, Ricobayo I, another new plant, Ricobayo II, with 151 MW. With this investment of 7651 million pesetas, the Government extended by 30 years the date on which Iberdrola would have to return the reservoir to the State, in 2040, so that it would enjoy its use for a total of 108 years, until 2040.\nHowever, Decree 1022/1964, of April 15, which approves the articulated text of the State Heritage Law, establishes that no concession can last more than 99 years, so that, regardless of what was agreed at the time by the Government of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, in any case the State will necessarily and inexcusably regain control of the plant at 00:00 hours on Sunday, February 5, 2034. At that time, the Government will be obliged by law to demolish the existing power plant, having exhausted its useful life, to return the land expropriated at the time to the descendants of its former owners and to restore the natural environment damaged by the reservoir, as established in the regulations currently in force. Under no circumstances will the extension of the concession or the maintenance of the dam be appropriate, since the regional, national and European environmental regulations in force require the demolition of this type of dam at the end of its concession period.\nWeir problems\nIts surface weir, about 700 m long and with a 14% slope, caused serious erosion, as the water filtered through a breach, the land sank and the spillway was consumed 350 m upstream, which meant that between 1933 and 1939 half of the mountain was badly eroded, causing a cazuela 100 m wide and 100 m deep, excavating approximately 1,136,000 m3 of rocks. The problems of this weir made it necessary in 1943 to build a Hydraulics Laboratory, the first R&D facility of its kind, in the village of Salto del Esla, to solve and study in a reduced model the problems derived from the large evacuations of water from the spillways. German professor Theodor Rehbock advised the Spanish engineers on the preliminary project.\n2021 controversy\nIberdrola released more than 70% of the water stored in June and July 2021 to produce electricity, which meant a significant damage to the tourist companies in the area that offer activities linked to the reservoir, as their activity was significantly reduced. The controversy spread nationally at a time when the final price of electricity reached historic highs. The Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera, described the maneuver as scandalous.\nThe price of electric",

    "\nEliza Crosby Allen (1803\u20131848) was a 19th-century American journal editor. For more than eight years, she served as the editor of the Mothers' Journal.\nEarly life\nEliza Crosby was born at Winchendon, Massachusetts, August 20, 1803. At the age of three or four, she removed with her parents to Montpelier, Vermont. Her mother survived her at an advanced age, residing in Louisville, Kentucky; and two of her mother's brothers, the Hon. Joseph Locke and John Locke, Esq., were residents of Lowell, Massachusetts. Her father died at Montpelier when she was about 18 years of age. Her parents were Christians; and her mother, sought religiously to train her six children\nAt the age of fourteen, Eliza united with the Congregational Church in Montpelier. Six years after, her views changed. There being no Baptist Church at her home, she retained her membership with the Congregationalists until her removal to West Boylston, Massachusetts, when she became one of the Baptist Church in that place.\nCareer\nOn November 21, 1827, she married Rev. Ira M. Allen, then of Brandon, Vermont, but who became, in 1830, the agent of the Baptist General Tract Society, and removed in the discharge of his official duties to Philadelphia. Here she was united with the Sansom Street Church, then under the pastoral charge of the Rev. John L. Dagg.\nHer labors in this new sphere, in connection with various women's societies, in the conduct of a young women's Bible Class, in preparing and editing tracts, and in relieving her husband by assuming the charge of the depository and correspondence during his frequent absences, were complex and onerous. At the same time, she took care of her home and received her husband's guests and friends. In addition to all of these responsibilities, she found time to become a contributor to several religious periodicals.\nThe Mother's Journal was first published in Utica, New York, by Bennet and Bright. It was a monthly publication of sixteen pages,designed to instill valuable social and moral lessons for parents and children. Allen was the third editor, taking over in 1840. Having fewer personal responsibilities than the previous editors, Allen was able to give more time to the preparation of articles for its pages, and in correspondence with friends, to interest them in its behalf. At the same time, her husband's employment was transferred to the American and Foreign Bible Society, and his residence to New York City. During the time Allen conducted it, her husband, Rev. Allen, assumed its proprietorship; it was enlarged to 32 pages, and published in New York City.\nAllen never enjoyed perfect health. Before her marriage, sickness brought her close to death. After that event, at Brandon, and for a time in Philadelphia also, she was the subject of a spinal affection which caused great suffering, and disabled her from walking. Relieved from this, her constitution continued to be feeble. Still, she remained active in the order of her household, in her interest in various societies, and in her literary employments.\nLater life and death\nHer husband, then in the employ of the American and Foreign Bible Society, being required to leave home on a tour for the collection of funds, was for three months during the winter of 1847\u20131848 absent from her. The responsibility of procuring the paper for the Journal and making contracts with its printer, and conducting the correspondence, as well as supplying the editorial matter, was not only in itself severe, but it occasioned inevitable exposure to the severity of the weather, which broke down her strength. When the influenza seemed to leave behind it the incipient symptoms of tuberculosis, she hoped to recover as she had in former years from a similar affection.\nKindly invited by the Rev. John Teasdale in June 1848 to try the restorative effects of a residence at his house at Schooley's Mountain, New Jersey, she found the air and the weather, cold and stormy. Upon returning home, exceedingly ill, her lungs were examined and the case was pronounced one of decided pulmonary disease. She gave instructions to her husband on the disposition to be made of her books and effects after her death, and also of her interment. Though her brother invited Allen to winter in Florida, she died on October 15, 1848.\n",
    "Venezuelan Assembly bill\nThe Law against Fascism, Neofascism and Similar Expressions (Spanish: Ley contra el Fascismo, Neofascismo y Expresiones Similares), also known as the Law against fascism or the Anti-fascism law, is a 2024 Venezuelan bill intended to \"establish the means and mechanisms to preserve peaceful coexistence and public tranquility\" and \"protect Venezuelan society from the emergence of any expression of a fascist, neo-fascist or similar nature\". On 2 April, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez presented it to the V National Assembly of Venezuela, controlled by the administration of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro; it passed its first reading on the same day, in record time. The law, which would need a second hearing, would ban certain organizations, messages on social media, and create penalties including increased sentences for organizations that promote what Maduro's government defines as fascism.\nMaduro's government says the law is needed to address what it calls unconstitutional violence encouraged by some sectors of society in the last two decades. Rodr\u00edguez referred to the 2014 and 2017 Venezuelan protests, stating that \"extremist sectors\" (referring to the parties who make up the majority opposition) had caused \"economic and social genocide\" in the country. Critics and non-governmental organizations say the law would be used to limit opposition to Maduro's government ahead of the July 2024 Venezuelan presidential election; an article in Spain's El Pa\u00eds stated that the law \"opens a new door for the control at the discretion of the Government of political freedoms and expression in Venezuela, amid a tightening of the persecution against opponents, journalists and critics\".\nReception\nA director for Human Rights Watch tweeted that the law would \"allow opponents to be criminalized and candidates to be disqualified\". Amnesty International criticized the proposed law for its vague and ambiguous definition of fascism, its limits on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly, and criminalization of opposition to Maduro.\nVenezuela's National College of Journalists stated that the law \"constitutes a serious risk for the essential rights of Venezuelan society, which are guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution and the international pacts signed by the Venezuelan State\", specifically, \"freedom of expression, thought, association, teaching and dissent\".\nSenators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Ben Cardin (D-MD) serving on the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations issued a statement expressing concern that the upcoming presidential elections would not be \"free, fair, nor democratic\", nothing the passage of the bill as \"further proof that civil society, political opposition, and freedom of the press have no place in Venezuela\".\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center expressed concern that, if enacted, the law could have antisemitic applications.\n",
    "Historic building in Cowling, North Yorkshire, England\nThe building, in 2016\nCowling Hall is a historic building in Cowling, a village near Bedale in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe oldest part of the building was probably constructed as a peel tower in the 12th century.  It was extended around 1450 to form a manor house, with the old section as one of two wings.  The old wing was altered in the 17th century.  The great hall and one of the wings were demolished in 1700, and replaced by a rectangular house in the Queen Anne style.  At the time, the house was owned by Henry Raper.\nDuring World War II, the property was used to house Canadian air personnel based at RAF Leeming.  After the war, it had a variety of private owners, most notably Greysham Macy, who cut a large peace symbol in the lawn as a protest against the noise caused by Royal Air Force aircraft.  At some point, it was divided into two properties.  The entire building was grade I listed in 1966.\nThe main block is built of rendered brick on a plinth, with stone dressings, quoins, and a pantile roof with stone coping to the left and shaped kneelers.  There are two storeys and five bays, and a bay to the left under the same roof with three storeys.  The middle bay projects and contains a doorway with a rusticated Doric surround, pilasters on plinths, a frieze with triglyphs, and a cornice.  Above it is a window with consoles, a frieze, and a triangular pediment.  The doorway and windows are flanked by narrow sash windows with double keystones, and the outer bays contain wider sash windows with double keystones.  The projecting wing to the left is built of stone and has a stone slate roof with stone coping.  There are two storeys and six bays.  The doorway has moulded jambs and a pointed arch, and above it is an arched cusped window with a transom.  The other windows are sashes, some with quoined surrounds, and to the left is a sundial.  Inside, there is some exposed timber framing, some 17th century panelling in the south bedroom, and roof bosses in the wing depicting a rose, and the head of James I of Great Britain.  The hall has some 18th century panelling, and two early staircases.\nSee also\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Burrill with Cowling\n",

In 2019, a Yemeni court ordered his release, however the Houthis continued to detain him.\nArrest\nTwo Yemenite Torah scrolls\nIn March 2016, 17 Yemeni Jews from Raydah were flown from Yemen to Israel on a trip that had been planned for over two years. The operation involved the Jewish Agency for Israel and the United States Department of State. Among those who aided in the operation was Israeli-American businessman Mordechai Kahana. With them, the emigrants took a deerskin Torah scroll which is allegedly over 800 years old. The scroll was seen as a national treasure by both the Houthis and Yemeni authorities. Upon arrival, both the emigrants and the scroll were welcomed by Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu. Photos of the scroll in Israel were seen by the Houthis, who said that it was illegally removed.\nMarhabi, who had lived in Israel, was accused of assisting the emigrants. In the same month, he left back to Yemen due to his difficulties in assimilating in Israel, where he was immediately arrested by Houthi intelligence services. Additionally, three Muslim men were arrested alongside him, including an airport employee who was accused of permitting the emigrants to board an airplane with the scroll.\nImprisonment\nSince his arrest, the Houthis have held Marhabi in a prison in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. Throughout his imprisonment, he has faced inhumane conditions, deteriorating health conditions, and torture. Marhabi suffers from issues in his kidneys and lungs, and has lost all of his teeth, allegedly from repeated torture. Reports also suggest that he had become partially paralyzed from a stroke.\nOn 18 March 2018, the Houthis sentenced Marhabi to three years and six months in prison. The following year in September, a Houthi-controlled appeals court ordered Marhabi's release, ruling that he was innocent and being wrongfully detained. The Houthis released the three men who were arrested along with Marhabi, but despite the court ruling, did not release him.\nHouthi ultimatum\nIn March 2021, thirteen Jews from three different families, including Marhabi's mother, made a departure from Sanaa to Cairo, Egypt. They initially refused to leave, but agreed when the Houthis demanded departure in exchange for Marhabi's release. One of the Jews stated: \"They gave us a choice between staying in the midst of harassment and keeping Salem a prisoner or leaving and having him released.\" Despite the deal, the Houthis continued to hold Marhabi. The Jews who departed were some of the last of their community living in Yemen. After they left, only four elderly Jews remained in the country. In 2022, a United Nations report said that only one Jew remained in Yemen. Jason Guberman, executive director of the American Sephardi Federation, said that Marhabi was \"undoubtedly\" that Jew.\nCalls for release\nHouthi rebels in Yemen continue to persecute religious minorities. Levi Salem Musa\u202fMarhabi, a member of Yemen\u2019s Jewish community, has endured four\u202fyears\u202fof wrongful\u202fdetention. We\u202fcall for\u202fhis immediate release.\n10 November 2020\nU.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism Elan Carr called for the immediate release of Marhabi on X (formerly Twitter) in August 2020, saying that he had endured four years in prison despite legal orders to release him. In November of the same year, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for Marhabi's immediate and unconditional release, saying that he had been wrongfully detained and that he stood with Yemen's Jewish population in calling for his release. In 2021, U.S. Department of State spokesperson Ned Price on behalf of the Biden Administration called for Marhabi's release. In the same year, during a United Nations Security Council briefing about Yemen, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield described Marbabi's detention as wrongful and a violation of basic human rights over his religious beliefs. She called on the Houthis to immediately release him and cease their human rights abuses.\nThe American Sephardi Federation (ASF), in collaboration with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, launched a campaign to raise public awareness about Marhabi's conditions, however it was met with little traction. Jason Guberman said that Marhabi's release should be demanded by not only the U.S. government but Jewish organizations across the world, and called it unfortunate how his case did not receive much attention from the Jewish community.\nSenior rabbi in the United Arab Emirates Elie Abadie also called for Marhabi's immediate release.

    "Afro-Panamanian gay rights and AIDS activist\nGilberto Gerald (born November 27, 1950), more commonly known as Gil, is an Afro-Panamanian activist, essayist and architect. He is known for HIV/AIDS activism, and LGBT rights in the United States.\nLife\nGerald was born on 27 November 1950, in Panama City, Panama. He was raised there before moving to Ghana, Trinidad and Tobago, and then finally to the United States at 17 years old, where he completed high school. He came out as gay while studying architecture at the Pratt Institute in New York City, where he was the president of a fraternity.\nGerald was born into a family of three brothers. His father is Alfred Nelson Gerald, the former Inspector General of Health of the Republic of Panama and former PAHO official, and his mother is Dorothy Whiteman Gerald. Roque Gerald, the former director of the Washington, D.C. Child and Family Services Agency, is one of his younger brothers. His older brother, Alpha Gerald, passed away in August 1985. His family spoke spoke both Spanish and English while he was growing up.\nAfter a process of four years, Gerald became a naturalized United States citizen in 1980.\nGerald retired in 2016 and lives in Palm Springs, California with his husband, Jeff. He is currently writing a memoir on his life and activism.\nActivism\nAfter graduating from the Pratt Institute with a bachelor's degree in architecture, Gerald moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as an architect. He became involved with local activist organizations after being inspired by a chance encounter with ABilly S. Jones-Hennin.\nGerald was a co-founder of the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays (NCBLG) in 1978 (initially named the National Coalition of Black Gays), alongside other activists including ABilly S. Jones-Hennin, Darlene Garner, Delores P. Berry, Louis Hughes, Rev. Renee McCoy, and John Gee. The goal of the organization was to support the interests of Black gays and lesbians, since many LGBT organizations were discrimatory towards them.\nIn 1979, Gerald and the NCBLG organized the National Third World Lesbians and Gays Conference during the first March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights.\nIn 1983, Gerald was elected as the executive director of NCBLG. He organized a sit-in protest at the office of D.C. delegate Walter Fauntroy when the organizers of the 20th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington were resistant to including LGBT organizations. This protest, and the arrests of activists Ray Melrose, Melvin Boozer, Phil Pannell, and Gary Walker, attracted the attention of civil rights figures like Coretta Scott King, Joseph Lowery, and Benjamin Hooks. Along with activist Virginia Apuzzo, Gerald helped ensure that Audre Lorde spoke at the march. Afterwards, King publicly endorsed the addition of gays and lesbians to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\nIn 1986, the NCBLG held the National Conference on AIDS in the Black Community at the D.C. convention center, resulting in the creation of the National Minority AIDS Council in 1987, which Gerald founded alongside activists including Carl Bean and Craig G. Harris. \nDuring the National Conference on AIDS in the Black Community, Gerald (with activists like Suki Ports and Carl Bean) spoke for two and a half hours with C. Everett Koop, the U.S. Surgeon General, who had not previously been aware of the disproportionate impact of AIDS on communities of color. This conversation resulted in additions to Koop's report, \"Understanding AIDS,\" which was mailed to every home in the nation in 1988.\nThis same year, Gerald left the NCBLG, which disbanded a few years later. On the disbanding, Gerald said that he believed that the organization just hadn't been designed to address the issues of HIV/AIDS. The National Minority AIDS Council is still in operation.\nGerald was the director of minority affairs for the National AIDS Network in Washington, DC, focusing on the needs of Black and gay people living with HIV/AIDS. During this time, he spoke as an educator on AIDS in the gay community on multiple occasions.\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, California in 1989, Gerald became the executive director of the National Minority AIDS Council when Carl Bean stepped down.\nGerald would continue to be a prominent organizer within HIV/AIDS and LGBT organizations in California, including the AIDS Project Los Angeles, Gentlemen Concerned, and the Black Coalition on AIDS.\nHe founded the LGBT consulting firm Gil Gerald & Associates, Inc. in 1991, which assisted non-profits and government agencies with LGBT topics until Gerald's retirement in 2016.\nWriting and appearances\nGerald's work, \"The Trouble I've Seen\" (1987), is included in Freedom in This Village: Twenty-Five Years of Black Gay Men's Writing, 1979 to the Present, a 2005 anthology of black gay male literature by E. Lynn Harris. His writing and essays have appeared in other anthologies and magazines, including several connected to activist and writer Joseph Beam, as well as the NCBLG's magazin",

    "Anglo-Saxon hoard of coins\nThe West Norfolk Hoard is the largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon coins in England, comprising 132 gold coins and four gold objects dating to around 610 AD, all found over a period of 29 years in West Norfolk. Its origin is notably close in date to the Sutton Hoo burial, with some coins having been struck using the same dies as coins found in a purse at that site.\nContents\nThe large majority of the coins are Merovingian tremisses. Of those that can be traced, 3 are from Provincia, 5 from Frisia, 17 from Burgundia, 27 from Neustria, 29 from Austrasia, and 30 from Aquitania. The hoard also includes ten coins from the Byzantine Empire; nine solidi and one tremissis. One coin in the horde was previously known only from an engraving in a book by a French writer which was published in 1666, and confirmed the coin's authenticity. Very few of the tremisses fall below 80% gold purity, with one exception being a plated forgery which is broken. Three of the coins are fitted with a suspension loop, making them into jewellery.\nAll the coins were likely minted on Continental Europe as the British Isles did not mint gold coins of its own; at least two of these coins were minted using the same dies as a number of coins from the Sutton Hoo purse hoard, itself dated to 625 AD. Multiple groups of coins within the West Norfolk Hoard were struck by the same dies as each other, and likely travelled together in parcels before joining the hoard; these groups and pairs originate from Maastricht, Javols, Les Cannacs, Mainz, Rouen, Strasbourg, Thiverzay and Windisch. While few can be dated, those which are dateable feature Byzantine emperors Justinian I (527\u201365), Justin II (565\u201378), Tiberius II Constantine (578\u201382) and Maurice Tiberius (582\u2013602) as well as Frankish kings Theudebertus II (595\u2013612) and Theudericus II (595\u2013613).\nFour other gold objects complete the hoard, which consist of a bracteate, a small bar with 44% gold and 48-50% silver content, and two probable jewellery fragments.\nHistory\nThe hoard was likely built up by a person who was moving around the Merovingian kingdom. The presence of gold items in the hoard other than coins suggests that their owner used them as bullion rather than as currency.\nThe hoard was placed in about 610 AD, likely buried in a barrow due to its proximity to an Anglo-Saxon cemetery before being scattered by later ploughing.\nFinds\nThe discovery of all the coins in the hoard spans 29 years, from 1991 to 2020. The finds were deemed as being part of the same hoard on 3 November 2021, totalling to 131 coins and four gold objects.\n1991 anonymous finds\nThe first coin from the horde, a tremissis, was discovered in 1991, and initially thought to be a stray find. An anonymous metal detectorist discovered 35 Merovingian coins at the site and declared them.\n2012\u20132015 David Cockle finds\nBetween April 2012 and December 2015, David Cockle, a 50-year-old police officer based at Downham Market police station, found 10 of the Merovingian Tremissis coins at the site, valued at about \u00a34,000 each, and sold them to a dealer in three batches over 14 months for a total of \u00a315,000, keeping the money. He had previously agreed to a 50:50 split of the proceeds with the farmer who owned the land for permission to be on the land, but he did not declare the finds to the farmer nor the Norfolk coroner who would have determined if the coins were treasure. Cockle had 30 years of experience as a metal detectorist.\nThe Norfolk and Suffolk Anti-Corruption Unit began an investigation after a member of the public reported him; he was arrested in November 2015, and charged with theft and three charges of handling criminal property in May 2016, after pictures of the stolen coins were found on his mobile phone which matched with coins stocked by a local coin dealer, who had already sold some of the coins. Cockle was suspended from Norfolk Constabulary the same month. He initially denied all charges, but later admitted to stealing the coins at Ipswich Crown Court in January 2017 on the first day of his trial. He was dismissed as a policeman by Norfolk Chief Constable Simon Bailey the next month following a misconduct hearing, who declared the incident as \"one of the grossest breaches of trust\". Cockle did not attend the hearing, though apologised in a written statement.\nCockle was jailed for 16 months and banned from metal detecting, owning metal detecting equipment, and entering into metal detecting agreements with landowners, for five years in March 2017. Judge Rupert Overbury stating that Cockle's motivation was \"pure greed\" and that he knew the legal process associated with such finds. In September, he was ordered to repay the \u00a315,000 or face a further 9 months in prison.\n2014\u20132020 anonymous finds\nThe majority of the coins were found in a single field by an anonymous individual between 2014 and 2020.\n",
    "Spanish businessman\nJuan Antonio Alonso Santodomingo (1844 \u2013 10 February 1917) was a Spanish businessman in the canning sector, and founder of the Palacio de Oriente canning company. He was the pioneer of the Galician canning industry.\nBiography\nAntonio Alonso was born in Bayona, Galicia, in 1844, as the son of Juan Antonio Alonso Castro and Rosal\u00eda Santodomingo. In 1862, the 18-year-old Alonso emigrated to Havana, when the country was under the sovereignty of the Spanish Empire, where he remained working until 1881 as a commercial intermediary between Cuba and the metropolis (Spain). In Cuba, he married Elo\u00edsa Gim\u00e9nez-Cuenca (1860\u20131935), daughter of an important military man from Matanzas. The couple had six children Pedro, Salvador, Rodrigo, Antonio, Mauro, and Guillermina Alonso Gim\u00e9nez-Cuenca, who married Eduardo Mart\u00ednez V\u00e1zquez, with whom she had Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Alonso\u00a0, who went on to become a doctor known for his humanitarian work during the Spanish Civil War and Second World War.\nUpon his return to Vigo, Alonso invested in real estate. It is in Vigo where he established contact with the canning industry and in 1886, he began his own initiative, starting with the help of his partner Benito Albela and from 1890 onwards alone. First, he began to export to France, like other Galician canning businessmen, but soon he began to export to new markets such as Montevideo, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, especially the latter because he retains friendships and contacts from his time as an emigrant. He diversified the preserves, integrating vegetables, and also the fishing process, building two vessels for fishing bream, said fish was destined to be sold both fresh and pickled. However, his first product was sardines in oil.\nStarting in the 1890s, it also began its expansion in the complementary tin foil market, and participated as a shareholder in the launch of a Basque company, Basconia, to compete with the Goitia company, a monopolizer of the tin foil market. Already with part of the management of the canning company shared with his children, he lived through the first sardine crisis, in 1909, from which Palacio de Oriente emerged reinforced by his movements to obtain sardines in Huelva.\nDeath\nAlonso died on 10 February 1917, at the age of either 72 or 73. Upon his death, his children continued the family business saga. His first-born son Pedro, suffering from health problems, did not join the business, and his only daughter Guillermina did not receive the inheritance, so the business saga was continued by Rodrigo, Antonio, Mauro, and Salvador, who in 1918 created the Antonio Alonso-Hijos company. 4 5 6 7\nIn 2014, the descendants of Antonio Alonso Santodomingo met at the N\u00e1utico to strengthen family ties; it was the first time that Antonio Alonso's successors met to exchange memories.\n",
    "Spanish footballer\nAntonio Aparicio Perales (10 September 1913) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Valencia CF and CD Castell\u00f3n. He was a member of the H\u00e9rcules CF wonder team.\nBiography\nAntonio Aparicio was born in Enguera on 10 September 1913, and made his professional debut with Ontinyent CF in 1932, when he was only 19. In just one year he had become the best left-handed winger in the region and the star of the team, drawing the attention of several scouts nationwide. In the summer of 1933 he was tried out by Sevilla FC, but Valencia, criticized by the local press for letting an Andalusian club take one of the pearls of Valencian football, moved quickly and signed him before the Seville team could make you an offer.\nAgainst all odds, Jack Greenwell barely gave him any opportunities, and apart from six friendlies, he only played one official match in the First Division against an ultra-defensive Arenas club de Getxo, in a match that ended goalless and with half the stands yawning despite Aparicio's speed and overflow, with good dribbling and capable of delivering measured crosses into the area. At the end of the season, and seeing that Anton Fibver had similar football tastes to those of his predecessor, he preferred to look for other options and signed with Levante UD, where he offered excellent benefits that allowed him to sign, in 1935, for H\u00e9rcules FC, which It was in the First Division.\nAntonio settled in the Alicante club, remaining there until 1941, including the period of the Spanish Civil War, except for a brief return to Valencia to participate with the Mestalla team in two matches in the Mediterranean League. With H\u00e9rcules, he scored 15 goals in 56 games in the top category, contributing to one of the best periods in the club's history. At the end of his stay on the Costa Blanca, he accepted an interesting offer from Valladolid, which, based in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, was fighting to compete for promotion promotions. The following year he went to Granada, where he remained for four seasons, three of them in the First Division and one in the second, in 1945. In the summer of 1946 he announced his retirement as a professional footballer at the age of thirty-two, after having defended the Granada shirt on 47 occasions.\n",

Snow's career spanned twenty years, focusing on U.S.\u2013Navajo relations.\nSnow was employed by the Navajo Service for this project after the impact of \"John Collier's draconian Livestock Reduction Program of the 1930's and 40s.\"\nEarly life and education\nSnow was born in Ensley, Alabama, on April 9, 1905, to Maud and Joseph Snow. He attended Riverside Polytechnic High School, and later studied geology and photography at Riverside Junior College.\nCareer\nMilton \"Jack\" Snow, \"Effects of Flood in an Intermittent Stream\", 1936\nMilton \"Jack\" Snow, Navajo weaver spinning wool into yarn; full-length, seated, with a loom behind her, Torreon, New Mexico, 1930s\nSnow was hired by the Los Angeles Museum in 1929 as the institution's archaeological fieldman and photographer. He went on to photograph the Wupatki National Monument in 1934. Following that he was hired by the Museum of Northern Arizona as a staff photographer. In 1935 he became employed by the Works Progress Administration to photograph the Navajo Nation, and the social, environmental and economic conditions of the Din\u00e9 people.\nIn 1937, he was hired by the Navajo Service where he was charged with creating a photography department to document the \"impact of federal programs on Navajo lives.\" He built a darkroom at the Navajo Service Employees' Club in Window Rock, Arizona. He also constructed a mobile darkroom in a panel truck.\nWriting in The Avery Review, Din\u00e9 writer Zo\u00eb Toledo stated, \"In the 1930s, federal officials invented a narrative of the decline of Native land\" which was linked livestock husbandry on the Navajo Nation to erosion. The Navajo Livestock Reduction Program was created by John Collier, the Indian Affairs Commissioner in the 1930s, which resulted in the Din\u00e9 people losing more than half their livestock, causing \"massive trauma to the Navajo world.\" The program negatively impacted land use, religious practices, health, education and tribal government. The Din\u00e9 people refer to the destructive impact of the program as the \"Second Long Walk\" due to the ways it harmed their way of life and economy (they made half their income from livestock).\nIn the late 1940s he photographed numerous trading posts on Navajo land; these images are in the archives of the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe, New Mexico. \nIn the 1950s, Snow photographed uranium mining on Navajo lands and the impact thereof on the people and their land.\nIn 1985, the U.S. government released between 20,000 and 30,000 photographs taken on the Navajo Reservation between the 1880s and mid-1900s. These included the Snow Collection, which were considered \"priceless\" because they documented times when the Navajo Nation was undergoing rapid change.\nExhibitions\nIn 2023 the Navajo Nation Museum received support from the Henry Luce Foundation to present an exhibition of his work. A solo show of his photographs were exhibited in 2024 at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology.\nDeath\nSnow died in March 1986 in New Mexico.\nCollections\nHis K\u00e9yah tse Khoi' = Land of Ca\u00f1ons (1941) portfolio is held in the Arizona Archives.

    "\nThe East Asian countries of Japan and Korea have significant contemporary influence over and cultural similarities with Northeast India, which engages to a significant extent with Korean and Japanese culture and has been receiving infrastructural investment from Japan.\nChina\nSee also: Sino-Indian border dispute and Greater Yunnan\nJapan\nSee also: Japanese\u2013Meitei cultural relations\nHistorically, Northeast India and Japan have been connected to some extent through Buddhism; other cultural similarities have existed for millennia, such as in food and through an appreciation for nature. During World War 2, the Japanese military collaborated with the Indian National Army in the region; eventually, the westward expansion of the Japanese Empire was put to a stop in Northeast India in the 1944 Battle of Imphal. Since then, Japan has contributed to the construction of infrastructure in the region. Northeast Indians consume some Japanese cultural products as well, such as anime.\nNortheast India is currently being prioritized by India and Japan as part of Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy and as part of India's Act East policy, with both countries seeing the region as especially important for creating trading routes due to their collective rejection of China's Belt and Road Initiative. Northeast India, in conjunction with the neighboring BIMSTEC country of Bangladesh, is seen by Japan as an important region in containing China, while India seeks to use its northeastern region to increase engagement with Southeast Asia. The geographical similarities between Northeast India and Japan, as well as India's guarding of its northeast as a sensitive border region that it is unwilling to allow untrusted partner countries to invest in, are other major factors leading to India desiring Japan's involvement in the region.\nKorea\nSee also: Korean Wave\nNortheast India has often felt alienated from the rest of India (sometimes referred to as \"mainland India\"), leading it in recent decades to look towards phenotypically and culturally similar parts of Asia in the east for connection. Part of this alienation is due to local insurgents and others banning Hindi cinema and other potential tools of \"Indianization\" in the region. In this context, Korean culture has become popular in Northeast India, with Korean words becoming increasingly prevalent in the local languages. Korean food has also become increasingly popular at local restaurants. The popularity of Korean culture that emerged in Northeast India has since spread to the rest of India in recent years. One aspect of Korean culture's popularity in Northeast India is its ability to incorporate Christian principles in a non-Western manner, making it more relatable in some ways to Northeast Indian youth than Western culture.\nSee also\nEastern South Asia\n",
    "14th century German Minnerede\nBeginning of the Minnerede The Monastery of Love in Cod. pal. germ. 313.\nThe Monastery of Love (Das Kloster der Minne) is a Minnerede (courtly love story) or Minneallegorie (courtly love allegory) from the 2nd quarter of the 14th century. The poem consists of up to 1890 rhyming couplets and was probably composed between 1330 and 1350 in southern Germany. The author is unknown.\nThe Monastery of Love is the story of a wanderer who is shown the way to a monastery by a messenger on horseback. In the monastery, whose headmistress is said to be Lady Love herself, he meets an acquaintance who shows him the building and with whom he watches a tournament before leaving the monastery again. Despite repeated requests, he has not met Lady Love in person, as she is only visible through her effect on the inhabitants of the monastery.\nDue to the uncertain chronological classification and the anonymity of the author, The Monastery of Love has repeatedly become the focus of literary scholarship since the 19th century, for which it was of interest until the late 20th century, particularly in terms of its presumed relationship to the rules of the monastery of Ettal. In terms of content, the special feature of the work in comparison to other narrative Minnerede and Minneallegories is that it avoids personifications, meaning, for example, that Lady Love (Frau Minne) does not appear as a woman.\nTradition\nCod. Donaueschingen 104 (\"Liedersaal manuscript\")\nThe oldest known manuscript of The Monastery of Love is contained in Cod. Donaueschingen 104. The codex was created around 1433 and is written in Alemannic dialect. The manuscript probably came from Konstanz. The manuscript originally had 269 pages, and The Monastery of Love has a length of 1890 verses. Of all three surviving manuscripts, it is the oldest and most reliable version, which is also the best preserved. The Minnerede has no heading in the Donaueschingen manuscript. The Cod. Donaueschingen 104 is now kept in the Baden State Library.\nJoseph von La\u00dfberg published the Donaueschingen manuscript between 1820 and 1825 under the title Lieder Saal. This is a collection of old German poems from unprinted sources. La\u00dfberg gave the then untitled Minnerede the title The Monastery of Love. According to La\u00dfberg, who considered The Monastery of Love to be the most beautiful work in his collection, Cod. Donaueschingen 104 is also known as the \"Liedersaal manuscript\".\nCodex Dresden M 68\nBeginning of the Minnerede De monte feneris agitur hic in Codex Dresden M 68.\nCodex Dresden M 68 comes from Augsburg and was written in 1447 by Peter Grienninger in the East Swabian dialect. The manuscript has a total of 79 pages and contains 35 smaller poetic texts, such as fairy tales, prayers, love letters and Minnereden, including the Minnelehre of Johann von Konstanz. The monastery of Love comprises 1866 verses in this manuscript. Of the surviving manuscripts, Codex Dresden M 68 is the most deficient. It contains numerous individual verses, some of which even impair the meaning, and has surplus plus verses, while at the same time rhyming couplets from the other manuscripts are missing. Peter Grienninger was not always sure of the spelling either: Grienninger gave the Minnerede the title De monte feneris agitur hit, which was corrected to De monte feneris agitur hic (translation: This is about the Venusberg). The manuscript is now kept in the Saxon State and University Library Dresden.\nCod. Pal. germ. 313\nThe most recent surviving manuscript of The Monastery of Love is kept in the Heidelberg University Library. The Cod. Pal. germ. 313 is 498 pages long and dates from 1478. It was written in the North Alemannic-South Franconian dialect, which is why today the Upper Rhine region is assumed to be the origin of the scribe. The Cod. Pal. germ. 313 contains not only The Monastery of Love, which is preserved on 63 pages and in 1884 verses, but also 55 other Minnereden by Heinrich der Teichner (Knight or servant), Meister Altswert (The old sword, The smock) and Fr\u00f6schel von Leidnitz (Overheard love conversation), among others. The Minnerede The Monastery of Love is included in Johann von Konstanz's Minnelehre and Hermann von Sachsenheim's Mirror.\nManuscript relationship\nNone of the three paper manuscripts that preserve The Monastery of Love represents the original archetype. On the basis of the known manuscripts, it is possible to reconstruct two branches of The Monastery of Love. The Codex Donaueschingen forms one of the two branches, as it lacks four verses that are contained in both the Codex Dresden M 68 and the Cod. pal. germ. 313. Since both younger manuscripts lack a verse that the Codex Donaueschingen possesses, there must be a common model for these manuscripts that refers to the archetype. Furthermore, Codex Dresden M 68 cannot have served as a model for Cod. pal. germ. 313, because Cod. pal. germ. 313, together with the Donaueschingen manuscript, contains verses that",
    "Volcano in Iceland\nThis article is about the Langj\u00f6kull volcanic system. For the glacier, see Langj\u00f6kull.\nThe Oddn\u00fdjarhnj\u00fakur-Langj\u00f6kull (Langj\u00f6kull) volcanic system of Iceland last erupted about 3600 years ago and is associated with current geothermal activity. The area of its central volcano is at present under the second largest ice cap in Iceland.\nGeography\nThe volcanic system is located north of Lake Thingvallavatn and its southern lava flows contribute to the floor of the \u00deingvellir rift valley central to Icelandic cultural history and the fissure system which is up to 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) wide extends up to 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) north. The Laugarfjall lava dome on the western side of the Haukadalur valley that houses the Geysir geothermal area with its geysers and other geothermal features is part of the southern fissure swarm. The shield volcano of Skjaldbrei\u00f0ur is prominent to the north of the rift valley with a height of 1,066\u00a0m (3,497\u00a0ft) and to the north the Langj\u00f6kull ice cap at 870\u00a0km2 (340\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area and second in area in Iceland, covers its central volcano of Oddn\u00fdjarhnj\u00fakur. The highest point within the Langj\u00f6kull icecap is to its north east where the Baldj\u00f6kull part of the ice cap covers a tuya of the same name with a height of 1,435 metres (4,708\u00a0ft). The geothermal area of Hveravellir with hot springs, fumaroles and mud pools is to the north east of the central volcano in the northern part of the fissure swarm which is dominated by Kjalhraun at 840 metres (2,760\u00a0ft). To the west is the Prestahn\u00fakur volcanic system with the small ice cap of Eir\u00edksj\u00f6kull 21\u00a0km2 (8.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area, and to the east of Langj\u00f6kull is the Hofsj\u00f6kull volcanic system with the large Hofsj\u00f6kull ice cap and to its south the Kerlingarfj\u00f6ll volcanic massif. A large tuya Hr\u00fatfell with a height of 1,396\u00a0m (4,580\u00a0ft) is located between Baldj\u00f6kull and Kerlingarfj\u00f6ll at the southern end of the Kj\u00f6lur plateau between the two volcanic systems which is reached by the Kjalvegur road (F35).\nActivity\nCurrently apart from the geothermal activity already mentioned at Geysir and Hveravellir there have been earthquake swarms to the south-east of the Langjokull glacier and north of Hveravellir. While some of the fairly recently erupted Hallmundarhraun lava flow came from vents immediately adjacent to the north-west boundary of the system these eruptions are now assigned to the Prestahn\u00fakur volcanic system.\nGeology\nThe Oddn\u00fdjarhnj\u00fakur-Langj\u00f6kull volcanic system is mountainous as it has ice age subglacially erupted tuyas and tindars up to 10\u00a0km (6.2\u00a0mi) long, with post glaciation lava shields and volcanic fissures with the predominant lava being olivine tholeiite basalt. Only effusive eruptions have been identified. The Oddn\u00fdjarhnj\u00fakur central volcano has caldera structures that have at their rim silicic hyaloclastite that formed during the ice age. The oldest deposits are about 800,000 years old.\nThe Skjaldbrei\u00f0ur lava shield has three lava units deposited between 6000 and 9000 years BP, and covers 170\u00a0km2 (66\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) with a volume of about 13\u00a0km3 (3.1\u00a0cu\u00a0mi). It is sometimes considered a separate volcanic system with the southern fissures having erupted lavas with ages between 10,200 years and the most recent Thj\u00f3fahraun lava field of the Oddn\u00fdjarhnj\u00fakur-Langj\u00f6kull volcanic system of 3600 years ago.\nThe 7800 years BP Kjalhraun flow to the north-east has a similar area but covers only 11\u00a0km3 (2.6\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) with its eastern portion broken up by faulting from the Hofsj\u00f6kull volcanic system. On the Kjalhraun flow's northern edge is the Hveravellir high-temperature geothermal field with an area of 2.5\u00a0km2 (0.97\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\nTectonics\nAs part of the Western volcanic zone of Iceland which is a receding rift, and the north\u2013western edge of the Hreppar microplate, the Oddn\u00fdjarhnj\u00fakur-Langj\u00f6kull volcanic system does not accommodate currently as much of the mutual movement of the North American Plate and Eurasian Plate as the volcanic zones to its south or east. The Western volcanic zone is an ultra-slow divergent spreading center, spreading at about 7\u00a0mm (0.28\u00a0in)/year  at the Hengill triple junction at its south and with no spread where the Mid-Iceland belt which is the northern boundary of the Hreppar microplate meets the Western volcanic zone at Langj\u00f6kull. The closeness of the Iceland hotspot to the east is believed to increase the magma supply.\nNotes\n^ The global volcanism program has maintained as of 2024 the Hallmundarhraun lava flow's historic assignment to the Oddn\u00fdjarhnj\u00fakur-Langj\u00f6kull system which could cause confusion as this erupted after the settlement of Iceland in 950 AD and is compositionally distinct. Other references were used to assign the most recent eruption of system to 3600 years ago.\n",
    "American politician\nJohn Chandler Kubacki (June 6, 1912 \u2013 November 23, 1988) was an American politician who was Mayor of Reading, Pennsylvania, from 1960 to 1964. He was convicted of extorting money from companies that sold parking meters to the city as well as madam from whom he obtained protection money.\nEarly life\nKubacki was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, on June 6, 1912. His father, Bernard, was a foreman for the Reading Car Wheel Company. Kubacki graduated from Reading Senior High School in 1930 and Bucknell University in 1934. He was involved in athletics and was captain of the Bucknell boxing team his senior year. In 1935, he became athletic director, teacher, and basketball coach at Wyomissing Polytechnic Institute. He served in the United States Navy during World War II as a physical training officer. After the war, he worked in public relations for a distillery.\nPolitical career\nIn 1947, Kubacki helped organized and was elected chairman of the Veterans Political Advisory Board, which was created to recruit war veterans to run for political office and lobby for better housing, sports, and recreation facilities in Reading. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Reading school board in 1947 and the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1948. In 1949, Mayor John F. Davis appointed Kubacki to the Mayor's committee on housing. Later that year, Kubacki was elected to the school board.\nIn 1950, Kubacki was elected as a Democrat to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He was an unsuccessful candidate for city comptroller in 1951, but was reelected to the House in 1952 and 1954. He was elected to the Reading city council in 1955 and resigned from the House on December 31 of that year. He also served as the city's director of public safety.\nBy 1958, Kubacki was at odds with members of his own party, including mayor Daniel F. McDevitt. In 1959, he upset McDevitt to win the Democratic nomination for mayor. In the general election, he defeated his former homeroom teacher, J. Edgar Hilgendorf, by 5,603 votes to become mayor of Reading.\nDuring Kubacki's mayoralty, the city began a number of public improvement projects, including downtown commercial redevelopment, renovations to the Reading Regional Airport, and a $4.5 million sewage program, and completed two parking projects. Also under Kubacki, the Reading Police Department started its canine unit and expanded its juvenile department. Kubacki filled boards with loyalists and dismissed longtime Reading Airport Authority executive director Mel Nuss and the director of both the Reading House Authority and Reading Redevelopment Authority, Phil Schmehl.\nIn April 1963, Reading Police Chief Charles S. Wade was indicted on perjury charges. Kubacki chose not to discipline or suspend Wade. On May 21, 1963, Kubacki was upset in the Democratic mayoral primary by Harold L. Guldin.\nCriminal charges\nIn 1961, as part of United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's war on organized crime, U.S. attorneys Thomas F. McBride and Henry S. Ruth Jr. were assigned to investigate racketeering in Reading and Berks County, Pennsylvania. On July 8, 1963, Kubacki was indicted by a federal grand jury for violations of the Hobbs Act and Travel Act. He was accused of extorting $10,500 from companies selling parking meters. On April 17, 1964, he and his co-defendant, rackets boss Abraham Minker, were convicted on all charges. Kubacki was sentenced to 30 days in prison and fined $5,000. In 1968, Judge Alfred Leopold Luongo dismissed the $4,250 unpaid portion of his fine due to financial hardship.\nOn September 9, 1964, Kubacki, Minker, and Benny Bonanno were charged with extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion for allegedly demanding payoffs from a brothel owner during Kubacki's tenure as mayor. The trio were found guilty on March 22, 1965, after a jury took just one hour to deliberate. They were sentenced to six months to a year in Berks County Prison. On November 16, 1966, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania voted 5 to 2 to grant all three defendants new trials after it found that the trial judge had erred by not allowing defense counsel to examine a tape recording of a statement made by prosecution witness Charles S. Wade and use portions of the statement in cross-examination. At the retrial, the alleged victim, Angeline Martin Wilkerson, refused to testify and the charges were dismissed against all three men.\nOn January 27, 1965, Kubacki was found not guilty of extorting $500 from a dealer who sold the city two police vans.\nLater life\nIn 1968, Kubacki returned to politics as a candidate for his old House seat, but lost in the Democratic primary. In 1977, he suffered a stroke. Kubacki died at his home on November 23, 1988, of natural causes. He was buried in Gethsemane Cemetery in Laureldale, Pennsylvania.\nPersonal life\nOn June 25, 1939, Kubacki married Mary Stockler. They had two sons \u2013 Alan and Joseph. Alan Kubacki is a former teacher and administrator in the Reading Sc",

    "Political party in Kazakhstan\nJa\u00f1a Qazaqstan (Kazakh: \u0416\u0430\u04a3\u0430 \u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d, lit.\u2009'New Kazakhstan') was a parliamentary group in the M\u00e4jilis existing during the 7th convocation from 2022 to 2023. Its formation was a response to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's reform initiatives following the January Events.\nThe Ja\u00f1a Qazaqstan group advocated for accountability regarding the January Events, pushed for the renaming of the Kazakh capital back to Astana, and spearheaded efforts to repeal legislation granting immunity to former president Nursultan Nazarbayev, engaging in constructive dialogue with the government and actively participating in the development of essential legislative proposals in the M\u00e4jilis. Additionally, the group established channels for collaboration with non-profit organizations and activists.\nHistory\nFollowing the January Events, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev introduced the political concept of New Kazakhstan in his subsequent speech to the parliament. This vision aimed to signal a shift towards societal renewal and progressive reforms in Kazakhstan. Consequently, the name Ja\u00f1a Qazaqstan, meaning \"New Kazakhstan\" in Kazakh, was established as parliamentary group consisting of 31 deputies in the lower house M\u00e4jilis on 9 February 2022, aligning closely with President Tokayev's vision. According to deputy Edil Ja\u00f1byr\u015fin, the Ja\u00f1a Qazaqstan group would be involved in addressing pressing issues by actively raising current concerns, collaborating closely with the government, contributing to the development of essential legislation, and working closely with non-profit organizations and activists, and implementing the reforms outlined by Tokayev.\nOn 10 February 2022, during a press conference, it was announced that the parliamentary group would include three subgroups led by co-chairs, deputies Edil Ja\u00f1byr\u015fin, heading the first subgroup focusing on agriculture, economics, and ecology; Aidos Sarym, overseeing the subgroup on human rights, security, and legal reform; and Natalia Dementyeva, leading the subgroup on socio-cultural development and youth. From there, Sarym also rejected the idea of forming Jana Qazaqstan group as a separate political party or a faction split within the ruling Nur Otan party. Instead, he advocated for reforming Nur Otan, highlighting the party's extensive presence with branches in every village and its significant influence as a \"great force\".\nThe Ja\u00f1a Qazaqstan group in the M\u00e4jilis has emphasized various projects during its tenure, notably requesting detailed progress reports from the Prosecutor General's Office regarding investigations into crimes committed during the January Events of 2022.\nIn September 2022, the parliamentary group supported President Tokayev's proposal to change the presidential term from five years to a non-renewable seven-year term, contingent upon its adoption prior to the snap presidential election of 2022. Additionally, the Ja\u00f1a Qazaqstan group proposed the initiative to rename the capital from Nur-Sultan back to Astana. Subsequently, the constitutional amendments were unanimously ratified by the M\u00e4jilis deputies and signed into law by Tokayev.\nIn October 2022, the Ja\u00f1a Qazaqstan deputies lodged a complaint with Chief Prosecutor General Berik Asylov against businessman Ramil Mukhoryapov for his derogatory remarks about the Kazakh language, urging legal action to address the issue, which they perceived as a provocation harming the country's interests.\nDuring the Ja\u00f1a Qazaqstan group meeting on 5 January 2023 with the leadership of Samruk-Kazyna, with discussions focused on proposals including support for publishing houses creating domestic Kazakh language content, implementation of projects aiding parents of children with special needs, singles, orphans, and disabled children, measures to support ethnic Kazakh diaspora abroad, and fostering an inclusive environment, among others.\nIn January 2023, the parliamentary group challenged the status of the Law \"On the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan - Elbasy\" which granted immunity former president Nursultan Nazarbayev at the Constitutional Court of Kazakhstan following its repeal in the 2022 referendum, resulting in a ruling favoring the Ja\u00f1a Qazaqstan group deputies, with the legislation officially repealed by the Parliament.\nThe Ja\u00f1a Qazaqstan group disbanded following the dissolution of the M\u00e4jilis of the 7th Parliament of Kazakhstan on 19 January 2023, as part of President Tokayev's reforms and the broader political transition within Kazakhstan, leading to the election of new deputies and the formation of the composition of the 8th Parliament of Kazakhstan.\nDeputy group chairs\nMembership\n",

The section where the accident occurred is part of the second phase and the eastern extension line of the Meilong Expressway, which opened to traffic on December 31, 2014. Both the project construction and operation are managed by companies under the Guangdong Communications Group. The operational management company, Guangdong Dachao Expressway Co., Ltd., has been involved in multiple contractual disputes.\nOn April 1, 2023, the Meilong Expressway experienced a collapse due to heavy rain, resulting in the interruption of traffic in both directions. There were no casualties, and the full line was restored to traffic by 24:00 on May 9.\nWeather\nPrior to the accident, Guangdong had been experiencing heavy rainfall.

Twenty-eight were treated at Meizhou People's Hospital, and two were hospitalized at Dabu County People's Hospital.\nCause\nThe specific cause is under investigation, with preliminary speculation suggesting that it may be related to geological structure, water erosion, construction quality, and other factors.\nResponse\nOn May 1, the Guangdong Provincial and Meizhou Municipal governments established a command headquarters for the accident rescue operation. More than 500 personnel from the public security, emergency response, fire, health, transportation, and mine rescue teams were mobilized for on-site rescue. Huang Kunming, Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary of Guangdong Province, made instructions and arrangements, convening two video dispatch meetings.

    "Spanish footballer and manager\nAlfonso Aparicio Guti\u00e9rrez de la Fuente (14 August 1919 \u2013 1 February 1999) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. With them, he won four La Liga titles in 1939\u201340, 1940\u201341, 1949\u201350, and 1950\u201351, thus being the player in the club's history who has won the most league titles. He also played 8 times with the Spanish national team between 1945 and 1949.\nAfter retiring, he became a manager and, for a long time, field delegate of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\nEarly life\nAparicio was born in Santander, Cantabria, on 14 August 1919. At the age of eight he witnessed his first match, and since then he has not missed a single match played by Racing, the main team from his native Santander. At the Colegio de los Jesuitas in Ordu\u00f1a, he met and played with Lucio del \u00c1lamo\u00a0, who would later come to play for Athletic Bilbao. Like so many other young people from Santander, he played football on the beach of Sardinero or under the discipline of very modest local societies, such as Daring Club, Magdalena, and Juventud Sport.\nHis passion for the sport was such that at Uni\u00f3n Juventud de Santander, he even paid to play, but his sint there was cut short by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, with the then 17-year-old Aparicio enlisting as a volunteer in Aviation Corps. He was enrolled as a replacement soldier in 1940 in the Automobile Regiment until 20 May 1942, when he was discharged.\nClub career\nClub Aviaci\u00f3n Nacional\nTwo years later, in the middle of the war, Aparicio was transferred to Zaragoza, where he met Ensign Francisco Samalanca, who was recruiting men for the project of forming a football team for the soldiers to entertain themselves on their days off: the Club Aviaci\u00f3n Nacional. Once the conflict was over, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid avoided disappearance by merging with Club Aviaci\u00f3n, where Aparicio had been playing since its formation in 1937. In this way he became a First Division footballer when the championships resumed.\nAparicio quickly established himself as an undisputed starter under coach Ricardo Zamora, who placed him as a central defender, making him the first football player in Spain to play in that specific position. He formed a great defensive partnership with Jos\u00e9 Mesa, one of the most solid in the club's history, which played a crucial role in Athletic's historic 1939\u201340 season, in which the club won the 1939 Campeonato Mancomunado Centro and the 1939\u201340 La Liga. He later formed a defensive trio with Jos\u00e9 Luis Riera and Alfonso Silva, which went down in history both at Atl\u00e9tico and in Spanish football as the so-called \"Iron Curtain\".\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid\nAparicio helped Athletic win the 1941\u201347 FEF President Cup, the longest tournament in the history of Spanish football, playing in all of Athletic's five matches in 1941 and also in the postponed match against Valencia CF in 1947, in which he kept a cleansheet in a 4\u20130 win, thus being the only Athletic player to feature on both phases of the tournament, although Valencia also had four survivors Juan Ram\u00f3n, Vicente Asensi, Amadeo, and Mundo. The trophy was presented by Armando Mu\u00f1oz Calero, the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, who handed the cup to Aparicio, Atl\u00e9tico's team captain. In 1942, due to a rebellion with his club over financial disagreements, Aparicio was on the verge of joining Rayo Cantabria, a mountain team where his brothers Manuel, Jos\u00e9, and \u00c1ngel played, the latter as a goalkeeper. When Spanish football adopted the WM tactic (3-2-2-3 scheme), he became the first colchonero central defender, as well as one of the first in Spanish football.\nAparicio remained at Atl\u00e9tico for a total of twelve seasons, in which he managed to win the League champion title four times in 1939\u201340, 1940\u201341, 1949\u201350, and 1950\u201351, and two predecessor titles of the current Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a: the Copa de los Campeones de Espa\u00f1a in 1940 and the Copa Eva Duarte in 1951. With four league titles, he is the player with the most leagues in the history of Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid. In total, Aparicio played 259 games with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, including 213 in the League and 46 in the Copa del Rey, scoring four goals (three in the League).\nAt the end of the 1951\u201352 season, Aparicio accepted an offer from Boavista F.C., a Portuguese team where he scored seven goals in three games before retiring as a player. He then made his debut as a coach, incorporating the Spanish footballers Pin and Roberto Yurrita, a position that he also held for Levante UD in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n in 1959\u201360, and then Rayo Vallecano and Atl\u00e9tico Baleares between 1960 and 1962.\nAfter returning to Madrid, he returned to Atl\u00e9tico, occupying the honorable position of Field Delegate until his retirement, which materialized in the mid-1980s.\nInternational career\nAparicio made his international debut for the Spanish national team in a friendly match against Portugal on 11 March 1945, starting in a 2\u20132 draw. He went on to earn a total of eight internatio",
    "2023 single by Christina Aguilera\n\"Learning to Fly\" is a song by American singer Christina Aguilera from the soundtrack of the animated film PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie (2023). Written by Aguilera and Jeremy Silver Abraham, and produced by Aguilera, Silver Abraham and Pinar Toprak, the song was released on September 22, 2023, as the third single from the soundtrack.\nThe song received positive reviews. It was praised for its emotional message, Aguilera's vocals and its piano arrangement. Music and film critics considered it a classic \"tearjerker\".\nBackground\nAt the end of August 2023, Paramount Pictures and Spin Master Entertainment revealed that the soundtrack of the animated film Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie would feature songs by Christina Aguilera, Bryson Tiller, Mckenna Grace and Blackbear.  The first single was \"Learning to Fly\". Aguilera wrote the song's lyrics and produced and wrote the track with Jeremy Abraham Silver. Pinar Toprak, with whom Aguilera previously collaborated on The Xperience residency in 2019, was also a co-producer.\n\"Learning to Fly\" is a pop music ballad played on the piano. The performer sings: \"Sometimes you feel lonely - that's when you learn how to find strength within yourself. (...) You must learn to fall before you fly up. You have to leave the ground before you touch the sky.\u201d\n\"Learning to Fly\" is  Aguilera's first English-language song since her 2020 songs \"Loyal Brave True\" and \"Reflection\" from the Disney film Mulan. Cal Brunker, animation director of PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie, said of the soundtrack: \"When approaching the subject of these songs,  we always start with the artist, looking at it from the perspective of an emotional story. Take Christina Aguilera's song for example - there's a really intense moment about Skye's story in the film, and Aguilera gives a heartwarming display of her vocal skills.\"\nThe premiere of the ballad \"Learning to Fly\" in streaming took place on September 22, 2023. Promotion of the single after its premiere was impossible due to the strike of the SAG-AFTRA organization (to which Aguilera belongs).\nCritical reception\nThe recording was positively assessed by music critics. A review in Variety called \"Learning to Fly\" a \"tear-jerking ballad\" that fits well with \"breathtaking, cinematic animation\". The editor of That Grape Juice stated that with the ballad, Aguilera \"sings an anthem of hope, inspiration and uplift\". Dom Fisher, writing for Geek Vibes Nation, appreciated the emotional message of the recording, stating that \"it has much more impact than in theory it should\". The Toya'z World website hailed \"Learning to Fly\" as a power ballad whose performer \"proves that she can still sing and sound beautiful.\" The review also praised the song for its \"restrained, composed vocals\" and \"soaring\" piano melody. Kyle McGrath, a journalist for Lilithia, praised PAW Patrol 2 for its \"great soundtrack\", including Aguilera's song.\nMusic video\nOn September 22, 2023, a promotional lyric video appeared online. It premiered on Nick Jr. on YouTube.

    "2008 rhythm video game\n2008 video game\nOnsen Nozokimi Daisakusen is a rhythm video game published by Atlus on July 2, 2008, as part of a promotion for their then-upcoming role-playing video game Persona 4. An Adobe Flash game, it is played through the web browser on the official Japanese Persona 4 website.\nThe minigame involves the player clicking to the beat of the music to spy on the Persona 4 character Chie Satonaka in the women's side of an onsen hot-spring bath, through a hole in the middle partition. The game took inspiration from how the player visits a bath in Persona 4, but its scenario is otherwise not connected to Persona 4's. The game was popular, but saw mixed reception: some were baffled by the concept and the game's existence, while some enjoyed it.\nGameplay\nThe player clicks to the beat of the music to fill up a heart gauge.\nOnsen Nozokimi Daisakusen is a rhythm minigame in which the player, located on the men's side of an open-air onsen hot-spring bath, tries to look into the women's side through a hole in the middle partition to spy on the Persona 4 character Chie Satonaka while she is bathing, while avoiding getting caught.\nTo do so, the player must repeatedly click with the mouse on the hole to the beat of the music, in double time, to fill up a heart gauge. They have to avoid clicking too rapidly, which results in Chie noticing them and calling them out on being a pervert; but if they on the other hand click too slowly, the fifteen-second timer will run out, and they lose their chance to look any further. Completing the game earns the player illustrations of Chie bathing, and the option to play through a second challenge where they receive an illustration of Chie bathing with Yukiko Amagi, another Persona 4 character.\nDevelopment and release\nOnsen Nozokimi Daisakusen was developed in Adobe Flash, and took inspiration from a sequence where the player visits a bath in Persona 4, although the scenario is otherwise not connected to Persona 4's plot. Siliconera described it as part of a trend of Japanese video games having Flash-based demos, while noting that Onsen Nozokimi Daisakusen does not actually act as a demo.\nThe game was published by Atlus on July 2, 2008, as a browser game playable on the official Japanese Persona 4 website, released as part of a promotion for the Japanese release of Persona 4 the following week, together with wallpapers and new trailers. In 2015, Atlus released Hanate Wotagei! Rise no Dance Battle, another browser game with similar clicking gameplay but different theming, to promote their rhythm game Persona 4: Dancing All Night.\nReception\nOnsen Nozokimi Daisakusen was popular and well liked, according to NLab, who also noted that their review of it was their most-read article of the week. Hayato Ikeya, writing for the same site, found the game shocking as a long-time fan of Persona, considering it uncharacteristic for the series; despite his initial reservations, Ikeya found the game fun and exciting, and enjoyed the ending. GameSpark merely expressed bafflement at the game's existence when summarizing the domestic game industry news of the week.\nWataru Katou, another NLab writer, described the game's peeping conceit as \"a foolish male mentality\" and as something that would be illegal to do in reality, but said that he understood the appeal of wanting to see something when you are forbidden from doing so. Wired called it perverted but sexy, and something to tide Persona fans over while waiting for Persona 4, describing the gameplay as simple but hard to master, and were themselves unable to finish the game; New Akiba recommended those who do not want to complete the game to instead watch a video playthrough. Wired described the sequence where Chie notices the player as \" on insane\"; Ikeya said that he and his colleagues found the sequence more exciting than the rewards for winning.\nNotes\n^ Onsen Nozokimi Daisakusen (Japanese: \u6e29\u6cc9\u30ce\u30be\u304d\u898b\u5927\u4f5c\u6226, \"The Great Onsen Peeping Operation\")\n",
    "\nDeborah (n\u00e9e Morris) Franklin (September 15, 1736 \u2013 September 23, 1787) and John Franklin (April 27, 1732 \u2013 August 29, 1801) were colonial patriots who assisted prisoners of war in Province of New York during the American Revolutionary War. Deborah helped patriot prisoners held at the New York City Hall, the Battery, and sugar houses. She and her son rowed a boat out to the prison ships in the New York Harbor at night to deliver food and other necessary supplies. She was banished from New York by British Commander Henry Clinton in 1780 for her aid. The following year, John accepted the position of Agent for Prisons in New York, serving under George Washington, but Clinton objected to John taking the position.\nBeginning in 1775, John served on the Committee of One Hundred and the Provincial Congress.\nEarly life and family\nDeborah Morris, born September 15, 1736, was a daughter of Sarah (n\u00e9e Powell) and Anthony Morris IV. In 1752, Deborah inherited a house in Philadelphia at 135 Pine Street from Samuel Powell. Major Anthony Morris died at the Battle of Princeton (January 3, 1777).\nDeborah married John Franklin on July 8, 1756, in Philadelphia. The son of Mary (n\u00e9e Pearsall) and Thomas Franklin, John was born on April 27, 1732. His siblings, born between 1727 and 1740 were Walter, Sarah, Thomas, Mary, Samuel, and James. Their marriage was an alliance of two aristocratic families, and an example of marriages between a family from Philadelphia, the Morris family, and the Franklins from New York.\nMap of Brooklyn, New York, made in 1766, with outlines of Wallabout Bay, where prison ships were anchored\nThe couple attended the Philadelphia Monthly Meeting. Between 1757 and 1773, Deborah and John had eight children, Sarah, Mary, Thomas, Phoebe, Elizabeth, Anthony, Rebecca, and Walter. By 1779, the Franklins lived near the \"New Slip\" in the shipyards (west-northwest of Wallabout Bay in New York Harbor).\nFranklin brothers\nJohn was a successful merchant, including wine, and he owned ships and operated a shipping business. John and his brother Walter were particularly well known as wealthy, community-serving Quakers of New York. Like his brother, Walter was elected to the Committee of One Hundred on May 1, 1775, to manage conflict between the British and the colonists in New York. He was a partner of the international trading firm, Franklin, Robinson & Company as well as a member of the Provincial Congress. Brother Samuel was a wealthy banker.\nAmerican Revolution\nIn 1775, John was elected as a member of New York's first Provincial Congress and sat on the Committee of One Hundred.\nRhinelander's sugar house & residence, between William & Rose Streets. The last of the sugar house prisons of the Revolution\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Deborah, John, and their son Anthony, born in 1768, provided care for patriot soldiers who were taken as prisoners of war by the British Army and held captive in prison ships in New York Harbor. The men on the ships were starving and Deborah and her son rowed out in a boat to deliver food and \"necessities\" to the prison ships off Blackwell Island (now Roosevelt Island). Elizabeth Burgin, a neighbor, provided food to prisoners and helped more than 200 patriots escape from the prison ships.\nThe British Army allowed women to provide aid to a man that they knew, but women who provided helped a number of men were looked on with suspicion. Deborah provided aid to men in sugar houses, prisons at City Hall and the Battery, as well as prison ships. British Commander Henry Clinton said that he was \"no longer able to hear or to bear the daily account of her contributing with unbounded liberality to the relief of her fellow-citizens, banished her, without regard to her station, her sex, or the inclemency of the season, from the city, by which act of cruelty, she became deprived the use of her feet.\" He banished her from the city on November 21, 1780, \"for her patriotism and kindness to the prisoners\". She went to Philadelphia on horseback. The experience left her with frost-bitten feet and thereafter in poor health. Deborah's father died in 1780 and she inherited a brick building at Walnut and Front Streets along the Delaware River, near the Morris Wharf.\nIn December 1780, General George Washington offered John the position of Agent to the Prisoners, with the caveat that Henry Clinton would allow him to return to New York. On January 4, 1781, Franklin wrote to Washington that he accepted the position that would bring him back to the city that Deborah was banished from, but a position that he considered important. Washington wrote Franklin on February 14, 1781, stating that Clinton objected to John holding the position in New York.\nNevertheless, Deborah stayed in Philadelphia and looked after their pre-teen son, Tommy. The family lived together in New York by 1783. Deborah remained there until her death.\nLater years and death\nDeborah died on September 23, 1787, when John was in transit from St. P",

This was her third title at the Italian Open in four years.

This also marked the first time in the tournament's history the Rome final was contested by the top two players in the world. \u015awi\u0105tek and Sabalenka were the fifth and sixth players to reach the finals of both Madrid and Rome in the same year, after Dinara Safina, Serena Williams, Simona Halep and Ons Jabeur, with \u015awi\u0105tek joining Safina (2009) and Williams (2013) as the only women to win both tournaments in the same year.\nElena Rybakina was the reigning champion, but withdrew due to illness.\nWith \u015awi\u0105tek, Sabalenka, and Coco Gauff all reaching the semifinals, this marked the first time that the top three players in the world all reached the semifinals at the same event since the 2013 French Open, excluding the WTA Finals.\nSeeds\nAll seeds received a bye into the second round. \n01.\u00a0\u00a0  Iga \u015awi\u0105tek (champion)\n02.\u00a0\u00a0  Aryna Sabalenka (final)\n03.\u00a0\u00a0  Coco Gauff (semifinals)\n04.\u00a0\u00a0  Elena Rybakina (withdrew)\n05.\u00a0\u00a0  Maria Sakkari (fourth round)\n06.\u00a0\u00a0  Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (third round)\n07.\u00a0\u00a0  Zheng Qinwen (quarterfinals)\n08.\u00a0\u00a0  Ons Jabeur (second round)\n09.\u00a0\u00a0  Je\u013cena Ostapenko (quarterfinals)\n10.\u00a0\u00a0  Daria Kasatkina (third round)\n11.\u00a0\u00a0  Jasmine Paolini (second round)\n12.\u00a0\u00a0  Beatriz Haddad Maia (third round)\n13.\u00a0\u00a0  Danielle Collins (semifinals)\n14.\u00a0\u00a0  Ekaterina Alexandrova (second round)\n15.\u00a0\u00a0  Liudmila Samsonova (second round)\n16.\u00a0\u00a0  Elina Svitolina (fourth round)\n17.\u00a0\u00a0  Veronika Kudermetova (second round)\n18.\u00a0\u00a0  Madison Keys (quarterfinals)\n19.\u00a0\u00a0  Marta Kostyuk (second round)\n20.\u00a0\u00a0  Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (second round)\n21.\u00a0\u00a0  Emma Navarro (second round)\n22.\u00a0\u00a0  Caroline Garcia (third round)\n23.\u00a0\u00a0  Anna Kalinskaya (third round)\n24.\u00a0\u00a0  Victoria Azarenka (quarterfinals)\n25.\u00a0\u00a0  Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 (withdrew)\n26.\u00a0\u00a0  Katie Boulter (second round)\n27.\u00a0\u00a0  Elise Mertens (third round)\n28.\u00a0\u00a0  Sorana C\u00eerstea (fourth round)\n29.\u00a0\u00a0  Linda Noskov\u00e1 (third round)\n30.\u00a0\u00a0  Anhelina Kalinina (third round)\n31.\u00a0\u00a0  Sloane Stephens (second round)\n32.\u00a0\u00a0  Dayana Yastremska (third round)\nClick on the seed number of a player to go to their draw section.\nDraw\nKey\nQ = Qualifier\nWC = Wild card\nLL = Lucky loser\nAlt = Alternate\nSE = Special exempt\nPR = Protected ranking\nITF = ITF entry\nJE = Junior exempt\nw/o = Walkover\nr = Retired\nd = Defaulted\nSR = Special ranking\nFinals\nTop half\nSection 1\nSection 2\nSection 3\nSection 4\nBottom half\nSection 5\nSection 6\nSection 7\nSection 8\nSeeded players\nThe following are the seeded players.

    "\nThe pilgrimage to Candelaria (popularly called the Candelaria Walk) is a religious march that takes place every year on the night of August 14 to 15 in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) towards the municipality of Candelaria where the image is located. of the Patroness of the Canary Islands, the Virgin of Candelaria. It is one of the most popular events in the Canary Islands.\nHistory\nThe festivities of the Virgin of Candelaria that are celebrated on February 2 are a continuation of the one carried out by the conquerors in 1497 and the one on August 15 dates back to the 18th century and was financed with the alms of the town, where the appearance of the Virgin to the Guanches is remembered.\nAccording to Fray Alonso de Espinosa (1594), the current so-called cave of San Blas was a place of pilgrimage for the Guanches of Tenerife to worship Chaxiraxi (the name that the Guanches gave to the Virgin). This pilgrimage was usually carried out during the August moon or Be\u00f1esmen. The Be\u00f1esmen in the Guanche calendar was an agricultural festival where the collection of the land's products was dedicated to Chaxiraxi. The Guanches offered gofio, goat meat, milk, cereals, etc. For all this, the Pilgrimage to Candelaria is a clear vestige of the Guanche Be\u00f1esmen, which is several centuries old and was even carried out by the Menceyes (aboriginal kings).\nThe Pilgrimage to Candelaria was the precedent of a tradition deeply rooted in all the Canary Islands, that of visiting the patron saint of each of the islands on foot.\nCharacteristics\nPilgrims in general usually leave their localities or towns or from the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife or San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna. Many people from the north of the island also take part in this tradition, but they generally leave three days before, in order to arrive at the Candelaria on August 15, the main day of the festival. Commonly, they spend the night camping.\nGenerally, most of the route for pilgrims coming from the Metropolitan Area is the Carretera General del Sur (TF-28), which is located on the Autopista TF-1. Also parallel to the highway is the so-called \"Camino del Peregrino\" (Pilgrim's Path), a road that runs through the municipalities of Candelaria, El Rosario and Santa Cruz de Tenerife. This route also remains open throughout the year.\nRecently, the organization of the pilgrimage route to Candelaria was carried out along the old Camino Real or \"Old Road\", which connected La Laguna with Candelaria, this route has the category of Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural (BIC) with category of Historical Site. The municipalities of El Sauzal, Tacoronte, Tegueste, La Laguna, El Rosario, La Victoria de Acentejo and La Matanza de Acentejo joined this initiative in 2008.\nPilgrims arriving from other islands or the Iberian Peninsula usually arrive by boat or plane to the island, and generally leave from Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the capital. For the festivities of February 2 of the Virgin, small groups also make the pilgrimage on foot, although due to weather reasons due to the winter dates, it is not as popular as in August.\n",
    "Ubaidullah Khan (1476\u20131539) was the 4th Shaybanid Khan of Bukhara, who ruled between 1534 and 1539. He was the son of Mahmud and nephew of Muhammad Shaybani, founder of the Shaybanid dynasty.\nBiography\nAfter the death of Muhammad Shaybani in 1510, the cities and lands controlled by the Uzbeks were divided among the family members. Bukhara fell to Ubaidullah Khan, which he had to defend against Babur Emir of Kabul and future Mughal Emperor, and against the Safavids of Iran in 1511/12. Ubaidullah and Jani Beg, the commander-in-chief of the army, proved themselves as capable generals. Babur's defeat at Gadjdivan in 1512 finally secured the Uzbeks' possession of the land between Amu Darya and Syr Darya.\nMir Arab Madrasa built in 1536 under Ubaidullah Khan.\nUbaidullah was not only a military man and politician, but also an amateur scholar, poet and builder. His time saw the construction of the Kalan Mosque in 1514, next to the Kalyan Minaret from the 12th century on the site of an old palace mosque, and the construction of the Mir Arab Madrasa (1535/36) in Bukhara. The madrasa was financed by Ubaidullah by selling 3,000 captured Shiites into slavery.\nHowever, Ubaidullah failed to defeat Iranian Shah Tahmasp I (ruled 1524\u201376), as his five offensives in Khorasan were ultimately unsuccessful. In September 1528 he suffered a defeat in the Battle of Turbet-i-Sheikh Jam, where the Iranians had deployed artillery for the first time. Furthermore, unlike him, his commanders were not interested in permanently occupying Khorasan. The plundering of the country was enough for them. Likewise, the Uzbek Khan Abu Sa'id, who ruled Samarkand between 1530 and 1533, had no interest in strengthening Ubaidullah's domestic power and refused to help him.\nFinally, in 1538, Ubaidullah, now Khan himself, moved against the independent Khwarazm, the later Khanate of Khiva, and killed the local Khan Avanish, but was soon driven out by his son Din Muhammed. Shortly after this defeat, he died and was buried in the Mir Arab Madrasa. Power struggles broke out among the Uzbeks which lasted until 1556.\nSources\nHoworth, Henry Hoyle.

    "American classical composer (born 1953)\nJeffrey Hass (born November 24, 1953, in New York) is a contemporary American classical composer of acoustic and electroacoustic music. He is best known for his compositions combining electronic soundtracks with solo instruments or with large ensembles such as wind ensemble and orchestra. He currently serves the Jacobs School of Music as professor emeritus.\nBiography\nHass studied at the Stecher and Horowitz School of Music from 1960 to 1971. He then attended Vassar College and graduated with a B.A. in music in 1975. He continued his education at Rutgers University, earning an M.A. in Music Composition and Theory in 1979. Finally, he received a D.Mus. in Composition, Theory and Electronic Music, with High Distinction, from the Indiana University School of Music in 1989.\nHass was a composition faculty member at the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University (retiring in 2019) where he served as Director of the School's Center for Electronic and Computer Music from 1984 to 2019.\u00a0He was also appointed adjunct professor of Dance Technology in 2007 and currently serves the Jacobs School as professor emeritus.\nLater in his career, he developed an interest in composing works for contemporary dance and ballet, often accompanied by visual projection.

    "Russian serial killer and robber\nAlexander Nikolayevich Astashev (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0410\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0432; born November 17, 1956), known as The Cheremkhovo Poisoner (Russian: \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c), is a Russian serial killer and robber who, together with his wife and another female accomplice, poisoned 31 people across various oblasts from 2003 to 2005. Of these, 17 proved fatal.\nAll three would later be arrested, with Astashev being ruled incompetent to stand trial while his accomplices were imprisoned.\nEarly life\nAlexander Astashev was born on November 17, 1956, in the town of Cheremkhovo, Irkutsk Oblast. Little is known about his childhood and adolescent years.\nDuring the Soviet and post-Soviet years, Astashev was incarcerated multiple times for a variety of offenses, beginning when he was a child in 1972. In 1982, he was caught abusing a child and later attempted to escape while being transported to prison, for which he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. After serving it out in full, he returned to Cheremkhovo in 1997. Not long after, he was arrested for an incident in which one person was stabbed to death and another severely wounded; however, it was ruled to be a case of excessive self-defense, and Astashev received only a minor prison sentence.\nIn that same year, he married a local resident, Natalia, who was 20 years younger than him and worked as the head teacher at a kindergarten. A daughter was born out of this marriage, and Astashev had to resort to working odd jobs to earn money. During later interviews with police, he complained about how hard life is in a mining town, leading to suspicions that he began his criminal activities for monetary gain.\nMurders\nModus operandi\nAstashev teamed up with his wife and 19-year-old mistress Anastasia Musikhina, who aided him in most of the crimes. Traveling around Irkutsk Oblast and later on in other regions, Astashev sought out elderly people on the streets and presented himself as a doctor; to make himself more believable, he always wore a medical coat, a tonometer, and a phonendoscope. During the conversation, he would ask them about their health and offer to treat them for free at home; if the victim accepted, Astashev and his accomplices would go to the house, where he would perform superficial medical procedures to put the victim at ease. Once trust was earned, he would give his victims a handful of potent sleeping pills (aminazine, suprastin and barbiturates) and a low-alcohol fruit-flavored drink kept in a balm bottle, which he presented as a \"syrup.\" Soon after taking this mixture, the victim would either fall asleep or die, whereupon Astashev and his accomplices would ransack the apartment, stealing various appliances, precious jewelry, money, and, in some cases, even food and drinks from the refrigerator.\nAstashev committed his first crime on October 13, 2003, in the village of Zalari, Irkutsk Oblast. The victims were an elderly couple, with the husband succumbing to acute poisoning on the way to the hospital while his wife managed to survive. Everything of value was stolen from their house.\nIn the spring of 2004, Astashev committed his first crime with the aid of his wife, who presented herself as a \"nurse.\" Clad in a medical coat, he went to the village of Nizhnyaya Iret and tricked a local couple into drinking his concoction, which knocked them out. While the couple were unconscious, the Astashevs stole a variety of items totaling 17.5 thousand rubles and fled in a Lada Niva. Five days later, one of the victims, a 67-year-old, died from complications relating to this incident.\nIn the summer of 2004, Astashev drugged and robbed a resident of Krasnoyarsk Krai at the Tayshet railway station, but the woman managed to survive and informed the police about the incident. After giving a detailed description of the supposed \"doctor,\" authorities quickly identified him as Alexander Astashev, and he was thereafter put on the federal wanted list.\nAstashev's most prolific period lasted from June 2004 to August 2005. Having committed five fatal poisonings in the Irkutsk Oblast, he and his accomplices soon switched to traveling to other regions to avoid being caught by police. In Perm, while waiting at a train station, he met a man with a number of illnesses who accepted his treatment proposal, after which Astashev took him to a secluded area and gave him nine pills and some beer. This victim survived the ordeal. In the town of Zuyevka, Kirov Oblast, Astashev and Musikhina, wearing medical robes, gave a medicinal mixture to a local pensioner, claiming that they were employees of the Kirov Hospital and that they were bringing free pills from the Central Pharmacy. On August 31, 2005, a WWII veteran was fatally poisoned in Kirov, in what proved to be Astashev's last murder. Other such attacks were recorded in the Chita Oblast (now Zabaykalsky Krai), the Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug (now part of Irkutsk Oblast), and several cities in Udmurtia.\nA special investigat",
    "\nLin Zhijian (photographed in 2020)\nLin Chih-chien's paper plagiarism case is an academic dishonesty incident in Taiwan's history. In July 2022, Lin Zhijian, a recent Department of Science graduate and Technology Management of Chung Hua University and the National Development Institute of National Taiwan University with two master's degrees and who announced participation in the mayoral election of Taoyuan City was accused by Wang Hongwei and others of copying two thesis. Zhonghua University and Taiwan University, respectively, both concluded that Lin Zhijian's thesis involved plagiarism and violated academic integrity, and their master's degree was revoked. Lin Zhijian was involved in copyright issues for plagiarism, which were also filed in civil infringement and criminal proceedings.\nLin Zhijian, who once served as a member of the Hsinchu City Council and the mayor of Hsinchu City is regarded as the future star of the youth of the Democratic Progressive Party. The controversy, which violates academic ethics, hurts Lin's Democratic Progressive Party in the 2022 Taiwanese local elections.\nBackground\nLin Zhijian, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, went to the Department of Science and Technology Management to study for a master's degree when he was an assistant to Ker Chien-ming, a legislative member of the same party. His master's degree thesis, \"Evaluation of the Satisfaction of Residents around a Science Park in China in TCSI Mode,\" was written by  under the guidance of He Lixing, and the oral was completed in July 2008. In addition, in April 2008, He Lixing, Lin Zhijian, and Wang Minglang (one of the oral committee members) jointly signed up for the \"Academic Seminar on Management Strategy and Economic Development.\" They jointly published the article \"Evaluation of public satisfaction in Hsinchu Science Industrial Park by TCSI Mode.\"\nLater, after Lin Zhijian's 2013 tenure at the National Taiwan University National Development Initiatives Institute, he was elected mayor of Hsinchu City Council after Professor Chen Ming-tong, under the guidance of, wrote a master's thesis on the leverage of the political and social foundation and its influence: in the 2014 Hsinchu mayor election as an example, in the January 2017 oral test through.\nAfter mid-2022, when Lin Zhijian announced his candidacy for mayor of Taoyuan, Wang Hongwei, a kuomintang, held a press conference to accuse Lin of plagiarism in his dissertation. Plagiarism is regarded as an election issue, and the comments of all parties are mainly influenced by the positions of political parties.\nChung Hua University paper\nPut forward a report\nDuring Lin Zhijian's participation in the results of the 2018 Taiwanese magistrate, some netizens discussed his master's degree from Zhonghua University, but it did not arouse many echoes. During the 2020 Taiwanese presidential election, Hsu Yung-ming, the Legislative Yuan of the New Power Party, once accused Lin Zhijian of plagiarism for his master's thesis at China University. However, Lin Zhijian and his guidance professor, He Lixing, had already clarified and denied it. However, the power of The Times refuted Lin Zhijian's statement, indicating that the press conference in July 2020 accused the legislator Cheng Chen-chien of copying his thesis and did not mention Lin Zhijian.\nOn July 5, 2022, Taipei City Councilor Wang Hongwei, a member of the Kuomintang, held a press conference to accuse Lin Zhijian of plagiarism in his master's thesis at Chung Hua University She accused Lin Zhijian of copying the 2007 Hsinchu Science Park commissioned Chung Hua University to handle the research bidding case \"evaluating the public satisfaction of Hsinchu Science Park in TCSI mode\" final report \"evaluating the surrounding resident satisfaction of Hsinchu Science Industrial Park in TCSI mode\" (signed by Li Youzheng and Wang Minglang). Wang Hongwei hoped that Chung Hua University would properly investigate and suggested that Lin Zhijian volunteer to \"return\" his degree. On July 6, Wang Hongwei and Taoyuan City Council candidate Ling Tao jointly held a press conference to announce that Lin Zhijian's paper from Zhonghua University was suspected of copying the text of Quality Monthly in December 2005, and the text similarity reached 94.1%.\nWang Hongwei publicly announced it again on July 28. She received a whistle-blower complaint showing that at an international symposium held in Beijing in October 2008, Wang Minglang and two other graduate students, surnamed Wang and surnamed Zhong, published an English paper titled \"Applying the TCSI model to evaluate the stakeholder's satisfaction nearby Hsinchu Science Industrial Park (Chinese Translation: Using the TCSI model to evaluate the satisfaction of interested people near Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park).\" Lin Zhijian and his thesis guidance professor, He Lixing, were not named in it. After comparison, the paper published in Beijing is the same as that published by Lin Zhiji",
    "Virgin of Candelaria (patroness of the Canary Islands).\nThe Camino Viejo de Candelaria (also Camino de Candelaria, Camino Real de Candelaria and Camino de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Candelaria) is an old pilgrimage route, declared in part of its route an Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural, with the category of Historical Site, since 2008. It runs through the municipalities of Candelaria, El Rosario, San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna and slightly Santa Cruz de Tenerife on the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). It is linked to the cult of the Virgin of Candelaria (patroness of the Canary Islands).\nCharacteristics\n21 kilometer long path, which corresponds to the path that connected the old capital of Tenerife, San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna, with the coastal center of Candelaria. It leaves La Laguna along the Camino de San Francisco de Paula, through Los Bald\u00edos and Llano del Moro, to head as the first major milestone on the route to the Church of Our Lady of El Rosario in Machado, continuing through the payments from Barranco Hondo and Igueste de Candelaria to the Marian villa.\nHermitage of Our Lady of the Rosary in Machado, located on the side of the path.\nFrom very early times it became an annual pilgrimage route, linked to religious devotion to the Virgin of Candelaria and her sanctuary. This path is already mentioned in the land distribution documents carried out by Adelantado Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo after the conquest. In the text by Alonso de Espinosa, referring to the miracles of the Virgin of Candelaria, he alludes to the opening of the road in the second decade of the 16th century, while indicating that around 1534 the hermitage of Nuestra Lady of the Rosary, as a resting place for pilgrims who went on pilgrimage. At the same time, it was the path used by the procession that carried the image of the Virgin of Candelaria in prayer, when it was taken to La Laguna due to the various calamities that affected the island.\nIt is therefore one of the oldest roads on the island and, possibly, one of the greatest heritage value, taking into account its antiquity, and the historical, religious and ideological circumstances that surround its future, without forgetting the ethnographic values derived of the construction of traditional paths, delimited by dry stone walls, with firm paving in the most difficult sectors and adaptation to the morphology of the terrain.\nCurrently, it continues to be used as one of the Pilgrimage routes to Candelaria. The institutionalized route of the Old road of Candelaria, organized by the town councils of El Rosario and Candelaria, takes place annually at the end of January (within the framework of the liturgical festival of the Virgin).\nSee also\nPilgrimage to Candelaria\nHermano Pedro's Way\n",
    "Village in Laukaa, Finland\nVillage in Central Finland, Finland\nKuusa, also known as Kuusaa, is a village in Laukaa, Finland, located 6\u00a0km (3.7\u00a0mi) north of the municipal administrative center. The village is centered around the Kuusaankoski rapids between the lakes Vatianj\u00e4rvi and Saraavesi and the Kuusa lock of the Keitele Canal.\nThe population of Kuusa was approximately 450 in 2013, making it one of the largest villages within the municipality. There are also a few dozen summer residences in the village.\nKuusa was not an official register village (rekisterikyl\u00e4), the settlement is located on the borders of five official villages: Pellosniemi (the administrative center of Laukaa), Laukkavirta, Haapavatia, Petruma and Kuusvesi.\nNames and etymology\nKuusa is named after the Kuusaankoski rapids, first mentioned in 1504 as part of the toponym Kwsankoskonsarj (modern spelling Kuusa(a)nkoskensaari), referring to some island near the rapids. The initial element is most likely derived from the dialectal word kuusas referring to a small spruce, as the trees are common in the area. Both forms of the village name, Kuusa and Kuusaa, are used by locals; Kuusaa is the older form, while Kuusa is more common today.\nGeography\nAside from Saraavesi and Vatianj\u00e4rvi, there are multiple smaller lakes or ponds in the village, such as Asemalampi, V\u00e4h\u00e4nharjunlampi, P\u00f6rrinlampi and Oitinlampi. The most prominent natural features in the village are the Kuusaankoski rapids as well as the hill Oitinm\u00e4ki, which is part of a terminal moraine formation. Its peak reaches an elevation of 172\u00a0m from sea level.\nHistory\nThe development of Kuusa began in the 18th century, when new farms were established near the rapids on the lands of the nearby older villages. \nThe first farms in the area were Saarikko and It\u00e4lahti, officially part of Haapavatia, which were formed in 1780 as the 16th-century Peura farm was split into four parts. Saarikko was divided into Yl\u00e4-Saarikko and Ala-Saarikko in 1841, while Rantala was separated from It\u00e4lahti in 1843.\nThe first farms on the lands of Laukkavirta were Keskinen and Karhila, later known as Kuusanm\u00e4ki and Hietala, which were separated from the Pellinen farm in 1823.\nThe village of Pellosniemi, at the time mostly lands of the vicarage of Laukaa, had a tenure farm (torppa) called Mikkola, which was relocated further away from the vicarage and closer to the Kuusaankoski in the 1890s, acquiring the new name Koskela soon after.\nOn Petruma's part of the area, the first farm was Varjola, separated from the Finni farm in 1872, while the oldest farm in Kuusvesi's part of Kuusa is Kattala.\nLog driving in Laukaa began in the 1830s as the importance of the sawmill industry had begun to grow. Wood was transported through the Kuusaankoski especially to the sawmill at Vaajakoski. In 1838, engineer captain Karl Robert Westling requested permission to establish a sawmill in the Kuusaankoski, however this sawmill was never established due to disagreements over ownership of nearby forests. Despite this, Kuusa kept developing, with the village's modern center forming in the 1870s.\nSince the 1880s, there had been plans to connect the P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne and Keitele, either by a canal or a railroad. In 1890, it was decided that a railroad was to be built between Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and Suolahti, which would also pass through Kuusa. The Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4\u2013Suolahti railroad was finished in 1898 and a station was opened in Kuusa. The railroad also allowed a post office and three stores to operate in the village. In 1924, a power plant was established in the Kuusaankoski, which provided electricity for the station and to the villages of Petruma and Haapavatia. Passenger traffic at the station continued until the 1980s.\nThe construction of the Keitele\u2013P\u00e4ij\u00e4nne canal, including a lock in Kuusa, began in 1990 to balance Finnish\u2013Soviet trade. Approximately 600 Russian workers were temporarily settled in and around the former Torikka school in nearby Vatia. The canal was finished and officially opened by President Martti Ahtisaari in 1994.\nEducation\nThere is a primary school for grades 1\u20136 in Kuusa. The school was established on lands bought from the Yl\u00e4saarikko farm in 1910 after the older Haapavatia school district was divided into two parts (the other being Valkola). Initially providing education only for the upper grades of kansakoulu (the contemporary elementary school system), it was expanded to include lower grades in 1940. By the 1950s, the main building had become decrepit and was replaced with a new building in 1957. The school was officially reformed into a modern peruskoulu in 1974, as was every other school in Laukaa.\nAn animal husbandry school was established on the lands of the Saarikko and Finni-Uusitalo farms in 1925, with a total area of 260.83\u00a0ha (644.5 acres). A weaving school that had operated on the lands of Saarikko since 1905 was relocated to Pet\u00e4j\u00e4vesi. In 1944, most of the building was granted to an agricultural school evacuated from the tow",
    "\nThe Moulin de Macaire  is a french hydraulic-powered mill located in the Brittany region, in the department of Ille-et-Vilaine, in the commune of Pl\u00e9ch\u00e2tel at a place called Macaire.\nHistory\nThe two primary mills of Macaire have origins dating back to March 10, 1418, and July 26, 1542, respectively. An authentic document testifies to the reconstruction of these mills in 1645. On August 13, 1828, a royal decree authorized the transformation of the mill into a flour mill. On August 17, 1835, Pierre Richard de La Pervanch\u00e8re, owner of the mill and all of Plessis-Bardoult, decided to demolish the old Macaire mills, moving them to the left bank where they still exist today, due to their negative impact on the reconstruction of the lock and spillway.\nInitially, these old mills had the shape of a spur upstream. A royal order of September 7, 1840 regulates and authorizes the reconstruction of the mills on the site of an old fulling mill, at the end of the new dam to be built. This reconstruction was completed in 1841. In 1844, the mills were put out of work due to navigation works on the Vilaine.\nIn 1852, the flour mill had four pairs of millstones, increasing to twelve roller mills in 1898. In 1899, a Sagebien type water wheel was mentioned. In 1862, the Macaire flour mill employed ten people.\nIn 1877, a metal footbridge linking the flour mill to the Macaire lock was erected, overlooking the spillway for 40 meters. This footbridge replaces the passing boat upstream of the dam, removed by prefectural decree of March 11, 1875. On June 2, 1888, Fid\u00e8le Simon, owner of the flour mill, was ordered to remove the footbridge, responsible for an accident which occurred on December 31, 1879, causing damage to the Macaire dam.\nIn 1913, the flour mill combined hydraulic power and steam, still retaining a hydraulic turbine in place. The mill reaches a daily output of 200 quintals.\nIn 1932, the mill went bankrupt. Pursued by creditors, for a debt of 5 million francs, the owner is placed under arrest warrant.\nLocation\n47\u00b051\u203259\u2033N 1\u00b046\u203235\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff47.866317\u00b0N 1.776494\u00b0W\ufeff / 47.866317; -1.776494\nGallery\nMoulin de Macaire\nLock of Macaire\n",
    "Statue of Saint Peter of Betancur at the entrance to the town of Vilaflor.\nThe Hermano Pedro's Way (also known as the Ruta del Hermano Pedro or the Ruta del Camino del Hermano Pedro) is an ancient pilgrimage route, linked to the figure of Saint Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur (better known as Santo Hermano Pedro), who is the first Saint of the Canary Islands. It runs approximately 19 kilometers between the municipalities of Vilaflor, San Miguel de Abona and Granadilla de Abona, in the southeast of the island of Tenerife (Spain).\nHistory\nThe Hermano Pedro's Way is, in its origin, a transhumance route used by the Guanche aborigines to direct their livestock from coast to summit, depending on the season of the year. After the conquest of the island in the 15th century, it continued to be framed by a set of traditional paths, appearing on historical maps of the 18th and 19th centuries. This route was also used in the 17th century by Saint Peter of Betancur during his childhood and adolescence, when he worked as a goat shepherd, before carrying out his missionary and apostolic work in Guatemala.\nThe route\nIn 2005, following the canonization of the saint three years earlier, a study began with the purpose of recovering, revaluing and institutionalizing the path of Hermano Pedro and its adjacent paths. In addition to highlighting it as a symbol of union of the municipalities of the Abona or Chasna region (Fasnia, Arico, Granadilla de Abona, San Miguel de Abona and Vilaflor).\nThe official pilgrimage takes place annually on the Saturday closest to April 24 (the saint's holiday).\nInterior of the cave of Santo Hermano Pedro.\nFirst, a Eucharist takes place at 6:00 in the morning in the main parish of Saint Peter the Apostle in the town of Vilaflor, the saint's hometown. At 7:00 the downhill or descent route begins, crossing part of the municipality of San Miguel de Abona until reaching the popularly known as cave of Santo Hermano Pedro in the municipality of Granadilla de Abona. This place was used by Hermano Pedro as a shelter or refuge with his flock in winter, as a place of prayer and even as a hiding place to protect himself from pirate raids.\nThe trail route lasts approximately five hours. The route is dotted with important samples of natural and cultural heritage; fauna of great interest that can be observed along the route; and other elements. In addition to important architectural elements and Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural (BIC).\nArrival at the cave is estimated at 1:00\u00a0p.m., where another Eucharist and the veneration of a relic of the saint takes place.\nIn addition to the promoters and organizers of the route: the municipalities of Vilaflor and Granadilla, other entities and volunteers from the religious space of the cave of Santo Hermano Pedro collaborate. In 2012 this route was promoted in the Network of Religious Routes in Europe with the aim of joining it.\nSee also\nPilgrimage to Candelaria\nOld road of Candelaria\n",

He was lord of Viarmes, Livry, Presles, Torigny, and (briefly) Tournan.\nLife\nPierre was born around 1260, the son of Pierre the Hideous, lord of Chambly (seigneur de Chambly). In 1277, he married Jeanne de Machault, daughter of the chamberlain Pierre de Machault. Her dowry included 65 livres of rent and 33 arpents (about 16.9 hectares or 42 acres) at Chapendu which were sold for 150 livres (about 12\u00a0kg or 26\u00a0lb of fine silver) to St. Magloire in Paris in 1289.\nHis father successively provided him with the lordships of Presles (seigneur de Presles) and, in 1285, Livry (seigneur de Livry). By 1288, he was also lord of Viarmes. He purchased the lordship of Torigny (seigneur de Torigny) in Normandy from Queen Margaret of Naples for 9500 livres tournois (about 768\u00a0kg or 1,700\u00a0lb of fine silver). In May 1293, he purchased the lordship of Tournan (seigneur de Tournan) from Jean II de Garlande; he ceded it in October of the same year to Charles, count of Valois.

    "Karstic cave in the Judaean Desert\nA view of Nahal Michmas, where the el-Jai cave is located\nEl-Jai cave is a sizable karstic cave located in a cliff within the northern Judaean Desert, in the modern-day West Bank.\nThe El-Jai cave served as a refuge cave for Jewish rebels during the late phase of the Bar Kokhba revolt, around 135 CE. A collection of 16 coins was discovered within the cave, with most seem to have been deposited towards the end of the revolt. Among these, were four Bar Kokhba coins and two Aelia Capitolina coins featuring Hadrian and Sabina. This discovery supported Cassius Dio's historical timeline over Eusebius's, affirming that the Romans established the colony of Aelia Capitolina over the ruins of Jerusalem prior to the revolt, rather than afterward. Additionally, it suggested that coin minting in the new colony commenced before the end of the revolt.\nName\nAccording to Palmer, the cave's name in Arabic, Mugharet el Jai (Arabic: \u0645\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0639\u064a), means \"cave of el Jai\", with el Jai being a proper name.\nGeography\nThe el-Jai cave is located in Nahal Michmas (Wadi Suweinit), in the northern Judaean Desert.\nResearch history\nResearch on the cave commenced in June 1881 with a survey conducted by the Survey of Western Palestine team. A further survey was undertaken by Uri Dinur in the mid-1980s, although no Roman-era artifacts were discovered at that time.\nIn February 1997, archaeological looting prompted further investigation, leading to the discovery of pottery shards and fragments of glass vessels dating to the Bar Kokhba revolt period. In January 1998, a thorough survey by Hanan Eshel and Boaz Zissu employing a metal detector yielded sixteen coins.\nIdentification with Rock of Rimmon\nIn the 1880s, William Birch and Hardwicke Rawnsley suggested the el-Jai cave as the potential location of the Rock of Rimmon, a site in the wilderness mentioned in the Book of Judges where 600 Benjaminites sought sanctuary for four months after the Battle of Gibeah. Patrick Arnold revived this identification in the 1990s, describing the el-Jai cave as a \"split rock that looks like a pomegranate\".\nHowever, Chris McKinny rejects this identification, stating that there is insufficient archaeological or toponymic evidence linking the el-Jai cave to the Rock of Rimmon. McKinley instead suggests to identify the Rock of Rimmon with the caves of Wadi el-Rummananeh.\nBar Kokhba coin deposit\nFindings\nA total of 16 coins were uncovered within the cave, along with fragments like the rim of a jug and storage jar found in the deepest part of the cave, suggesting archaeological looting activities. Two Aelia Capitolina coins were found, one depicting the city's founding with Hadrian ploughing its borders, while the other featured Sabina, Hadrian's wife. Additionally, a variety of coins spanning different Roman emperors' reigns were found, such as a Nabatean coin dating back to 18\u201325 CE, a denarius from the time of Claudius in 54 CE, and denarii from Titus, Trajan, and Hadrian, among others.\nAnalysis\nIt is believed that Jewish refugees brought these coins to the cave, possibly towards the end of the revolt. Prior to this discovery, only two Bar Kokhba coins had been found north of Jerusalem.\nThe presence of both Bar Kokhba and Aelia Capitolina coins in a single collection contradicts Eusebius's account, which suggests that Aelia Capitolina was established after the revolt. Instead, it supports Cassius Dio's account, indicating that the city's foundation predated the revolt and possibly played a role in its inception.\nEshel and Zissu argue that the el-Jai discoveries indicate coin minting in Aelia Capitolina prior to 135 CE. While the city seems to have been foundedin 130 CE, operational delays may have postponed mint activity until the Bar Kokhba revolt. Economic isolation between rebel territories and Roman controlled-areas diminishes the likelihood of finding Bar Kokhba coins overstruck on new Aelia coins. According to the two scholars, the rebels' shift in coin formulae, from 'Year One of the Freedom of Israel' to 'For the Freedom of Jerusalem,' likely responds to the introduction of pagan coins from Aelia Capitolina.\n",
    "Scottish trade unionist (1855\u20131927)\nThomas Douglas Hamilton Garside (1855\u20131927) was a Scottish mathematics professor and trade union leader. The son of a Scottish railroad contractor, he became an evangelical preacher in Northern Ireland, before moving to the United States. In Philadelphia, he joined the socialist movement and became an organiser for the Knights of Labor. By 1889, he had gravitated towards anarchism and was expelled from the Socialist Labor Party of America. The following year, he led a cloakmakers' strike in New York City, along with Emma Goldman and Joseph Barondess. After the strike achieved its goals, he returned to Philadelphia, where he allegedly became a United States Marshal. By 1893, he had returned to Britain, where he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and organised for tenants' rights. During World War I, he joined the Liberal Party, within which he agitated for welfare and pensions for veterans. He died in London in 1927.\nBiography\nEarly life\nThomas Douglas Hamilton Garside was born in Lancashire, in 1855, the son of a Scottish railroad contractor. He was educated at Stockholm University and remained in the city after graduation, teaching mathematics at a secondary school. He then followed his father's wishes that he become a preacher and moved to Northern Ireland, where he preached the gospel for seven years.\nSocialist activism in the United States\nIn 1881, he immigrated to the United States, initially settling in Baltimore before moving to Philadelphia, where he worked as a tutor for aspiring college students. Before long, the former evangelical preacher had become a socialist. He soon quit his tutoring job and moved into trade union organising, joining the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) and the Knights of Labor.\nOn 8 May 1884, Garside married Emma Mary Goldman,, the daughter of a well-off farmer from Berks County, Pennsylvania. In 1888, he had an affair with the anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre. In a poem about Garside, de Cleyre wrote lovingly of his \"tender mouth and Christ-like eyes\", as well as his voice, which she described as \"sweet as the summer wind that sighs through the arbors of Paradise.\" Despite warnings from Dyer Lum, who told her that Garside was \"vain and self-indulgent\", de Cleyre fell deeply in love with him. According to historian Paul Avrich, \"for all his charm and glib phrasemaking,\" Garside turned out to be \"superficial, egotistical, and callous.\" After a few months of their affair, Garside abandoned de Cleyre, which left her feeling hurt and betrayed. She wrote several poems about her rejection, moved back into her family home in St. Johns, Michigan, where she lived in distress. She was cared for in the aftermath of the affair by Lum himself, who became a stabilising influence in her life.\nIn January 1889, Garside attended a Knights of Labor meeting in Chicago, where he was scheduled to give a lecture on behalf of the SLP. The meeting was chaired by Lizzie Holmes, who had invited the anarchist Lucy Parsons to speak at the meeting before Garside. After Parsons' 90 minute speech, Garside stood up to give his 30-minute lecture. Garside had himself been invited to the meeting by the SLP's leader Thomas J. Morgan, who hoped to have an ally against Parsons, but Garside instead aligned himself with the anarchists. While Garside himself expressed concerns about the anarchists' violent tactics, he also dismissed electoralism, and distinguished between codified law and natural law. Morgan quickly denounced Garside, declaring that at the meeting he had \"disgusted all the socialists while the anarchists roared with delight.\" Morgan's speech was interrupted by the audience when he mentioned Garside, who they applauded. Dismayed by his defeat at the meeting, Morgan had expelled Garside from the SLP.\nLeadership of the 1890 cloakmakers' strike\nIn 1889, Garside moved to New York City, where he joined the International Working People's Association (IWPA), spoke alongside Johann Most at its meetings and published a pamphlet that critiqued modern industrialisation, which sold 15,000 copies. By this time, Garside had become concerned with improving living and working conditions for the city's Jewish immigrants, organising mutual aid societies for their benefit. In 1890, Jewish workers in New York's cloakmaking industry had organised a mass strike movement, 3,000 workers strong, led by Joseph Barondess under the banner of the United Hebrew Trades. Seeking anarchist support for the strike, Barondess invited the Jewish anarchist Emma Goldman, as well as Garside himself, to help lead the strike action.\nWhen Goldman met Garside during the strike, she described him as \"tall, pale, and languid-looking. His manner was gentle and ingratiating, and he resembled somewhat the pictures of Christ.\" Goldman recalled that \"He was always trying to pacify conflicting elements, to smooth things over.\" An article about the strike in The Midland Journal described him as \"a man who impresses ",
    "The Old Synagogue of Worms\nThe historical Jewish cemetery Worms\nThe Jewish Community of Worms (\u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d3\u05d5\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05d6\u05d0, the \"Holy Community of Worms\") was one of the oldest documented Jewish communities in the German-speaking region. Until its destruction by the Nazis, the Jewish community in Worms had continuously existed since the Middle Ages, with only relatively short interruptions. Due to this long tradition, it always held a prominent position in the memory culture of Ashkenazic Judaism.\nHistory\nOrigins\nImperial Eagle from a chandelier in the Synagogue of Worms. It symbolized the community's protection under the emperor.\nIn the late antiquity, there were Jewish communities along the Rhine. However, their continuity into the High Middle Ages is not verifiable. In the self-presentation of the community, legendary founding stories circulated, which traced the existence of the community back to the time of the first destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.\nFrom the 9th century onwards, Jewish merchants from Italy and France migrated to the area that would later become Germany. The territory was to be developed according to the aspirations of the kings. The immigrant merchants from more advanced and urbanized areas were part of this innovation push. However, due to the scarce sources, it is not certain when local communities formed in the cities along the Rhine. This lack of historical facts was already perceived as a gap in the late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period and was filled by a series of founding legends.\nThe two oldest written records that Jews lived in Worms are dated to the years 960 and 980. The oldest evidence of the existence of a Jewish community is the construction inscription for the Synagogue of Worms from the year 1034. It is also the oldest surviving construction inscription of a synagogue north of the Alps. The oldest tombstone in the Jewish cemetery in Worms (\"Holy Sand\") dates back to the year 1058/59.\nEmperor Henry IV granted a tax exemption to the Jews and the other inhabitants of Worms on 18 January 1074.\nThis is the oldest mention of Jews in Worms in a source from the surrounding majority society. In 1112, Henry V confirmed the charter. In the first half of the 1090s, he granted the Jews and the other citizens of Worms another extensive privilege. The charter guaranteed a comprehensive regulation of the legal relations of the Jewish community towards the Christian majority, an exclusion of the bishop from sovereignty rights over the Jews, and high barriers against conversion. The original of the charter has not been preserved, but there are a number of later confirmations. In one from Emperor Frederick I dated 6 April 1157, it is stated that the original to be confirmed was issued \"in the time of Salman, bishop of the same Jews.\" This is the oldest preserved mention of the Jewish bishop of Worms, an office that was the top function of the political Jewish community until the end of the Holy Roman Empire.\nFlowering period\nThe widespread influence of the Worms community is evidenced by this mural from the city of Worms in the synagogue of Mahiljou, Belarus.\nSince the 12th century, the Worms community, together with those in Mainz and Speyer, formed the ShUM federation, an acronym derived from the initial letters of the three cities.  These communities adopted a German rite in liturgy very early on, differing from the traditionally Italian-influenced one. All of this was documented early in prayer books and custom. Music also played an outstanding role. Auch Musik spielte eine hervorragende Rolle. From the 13th century onwards, the three communities also formed a federation in the interpretation and application of legal texts. The central document of this federation is the legal collection Taqqanot Qehillot \u0160um.\nAlso emerging in Worms since the 12th century was the movement of the Chasside Ashkenaz (\"the Pious of Ashkenaz\"), whose religious practice was characterized by strict notions of purity, impurity, and penance practices. The Kalonymides family, originally from Mainz, played a central role here.\nDue to its relative size, long continuity, and the fact that opponents of the Worms community only succeeded in temporarily expelling it from the city until 1938, it owed its long tradition. From this arose a series of its own customs and prayer orders deviating from those of other communities.  In the women's synagogue, there were prayer leaders who conducted the service as long as it was physically separated from the men's synagogue by a wall.\nThe Worms community was one of the largest in Germany. In the Reich tax register of 1241, it paid the second highest amount after the Strasbourg community. Over the course of the 14th century, the proceeds from this tax were increasingly assigned to various debtors of the German kings.\nProtection relations\nIn 1236, the charter of 1090, the Worms Privilege, was extended to Jews throughout the empire. The interesting formulation \"judei et coe",

    "Iraqi Statesman\nMusa Mahmoud al-Shabandar (Arabic: \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0631) was an Iraqi politician who held various positions in Iraqi governments during the Kingdom of Iraq period, including serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs several times between 1941 and 1955. He's also the founder of what would become the Shabandar Coffeehouse.\nEarly life\nMusa al-Shabandar was born in the Jadid Hassan Pasha locality in Baghdad, located near al-Ma'mun Street and a locality of merchants and respected Baghdadi nobles. His father was Mahmoud al-Shabandar, a wealthy Baghdadi land and property owner. Musa was the al-Shabandar family's eldest son and played games with his siblings, including his younger brother Ibrahim al-Shabandar. Musa used to occupy his father to coffeehouses and he would listen to conversations in the coffeehouse. He would attend several schools and learn the Quran, several languages, and history at a young age under several Baghdadi scholars.\nAl-Shabandar spoke English, French, and German and would soon move to Berlin in the Weimer Republic after the Armistice of 11 November 1918 was signed. He would move back to Baghdad in 1932 where he was appointed in the Iraqi delegation in the League of Nations.\nPolitical career\nOn 10 October 1933, al-Shabandar was appointed as the consul of Switzerland by the Iraqi government. In 1937, al-Shabandar was accused of giving certificates of export to Iraq for munitions meant to reach Spain. As a result, he was recalled and put under house arrest. Although the proceedings against him were dropped he became the deputy for Amarah until 1939.\nAfter Rashid Ali al-Gaylani took over the Iraqi government during the 1941 Iraqi Golden Square coup d'\u00e9tat, al-Shabandar became the foreign minister. Al-Shabandar stood out from the rest of al-Gaylani's government for being the only part of the ruling class and a wealthy landowner, owning property in Berlin, while the rest were in the middle class. Al-Shabandar would later recount in his memoirs that a majority of Arabs at the time had sympathy towards Nazi Germany due to frustrations with imperialism and Zionism. The issues of various Arab states, as well as Nazi propaganda, played a big effect on Iraqis' sympathy. Al-Shabandar was a supporter of al-Gaylani but on 29 May, he would flee to Tehran along with many Iraqi officials after al-Gaylani's government fell.\nAl-Shabandar was later caught in Rhodesia and was sent back to Iraq to stand trail where he was sentenced to four years in prison in 1944. Al-Shabandar's sentence lasted until 1947, and in 1949, he would become a member of Nuri al-Said's Constitutional Union Party. Al-Said would also appoint al-Shabandar as the ambassador to Damascus during the presidency of Syrian military officer Husni al-Za'im in order to further develop Syrian-Iraqi relations.\nAl-Shabandar returned to occupy the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of Muhammad Fadhel al-Jamali for a short period from March 8, 1954, until April 29, 1954. He also held the same position for a longer period from August 3, 1954, until May 8, 1955, in the government of Nuri al-Said.\n",

    "Russian revolutionary (1855\u2013c.1930)\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is  Dmitrievna and the family name is  Subbotina.\nNadezhda Dmitrievna Subbotina (Russian: \u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0443\u0431\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430; 1855\u2013c.\u20091930) was a Russian Narodnik revolutionary. Born into a noble family, she went abroad to receive an education in philosophy at the University of Zurich, where she became involved in revolutionary circles. After returning to Russia, she moved through various towns and cities, where she conducted anti-Tsarist propaganda, for which she was arrested and prosecuted first in the Trial of the 193 and then in the Trial of the 50\u00a0. She was exiled to Tomsk Governorate, where she spent most of the 1880s, before returning to European Russia.\nBiography\nNadezhda Dmitrievna Subbotina was born in 1855, in the village of Podvorgolskoye, in the Oryol Governorate of the Russian Empire. She was the youngest daughter of a noble landowner, Dmitrii Subbotin, who died shortly after her birth, leaving his children with a considerable inheritance. The girls' mother, Sofya Subbotina, endeavoured to provide them with the best possible education, enrolling them at a girls' school in Moscow in 1868.\nShe never formally graduated from school, as in 1873, she travelled abroad with her mother to Switzerland, where she was reunited with her sisters Evgeniia and Maria. She settled in Zurich, where she took classes on philosophy at the University of Zurich, worked on Pyotr Lavrov's magazine Vpered and joined the Fritschi women's circle. In 1874, she returned to Russia, following a summons from the government. She briefly settled in the capital of Saint Petersburg, before returning home to Podvorgolskoye in order to conduct propaganda. As she was surveilled by the police, she decided to move to Oryol, where she joined the revolutionary circle of Pyotr Zaichnevsky\u00a0.\nShe subsequently moved to Belomestnoye\u00a0 and then to Tetyushi, where she lived for a while with Lydia Figner, before moving on to Kazan. She was arrested there on 23 September 1874, and prosecuted for anti-government propaganda in the Trial of the 193. She was released, but kept under police surveillance.\nWhile the case was resolved, in the summer of 1875, she moved to Odesa, where she joined another revolutionary circle and helped to smuggle radical literature into the country from abroad. She then moved to Moscow, where she carried out propaganda work for the All-Russian Socialist Revolutionary Organisation. On 7 August 1875, she was arrested and again prosecuted for anti-government propaganda, for which she was held in pre-trial detention in Butyrka prison, where she participated in a prison riot. She was transferred to Saint Petersburg, where, on 30 November 1876, she was charged for anti-government propaganda in the Trial of the 50\u00a0 and sentenced to exile in Tomsk province. In September 1877, she was transferred to Narym, but as she had fallen ill, she was instead taken to Naimsk. In July 1880, she moved to the city of Tomsk, where she married Stepan Mokievskyy-Zubok. On 7 January 1881, she was arrested after she had been named as a member of Narodnaya Volya. She returned to European Russia in 1889. After the establishment of the Soviet Union, in 1930, she became a member of the Society of Former Political Prisoners and Exiled Settlers.\n",

    "Indian playwright and prompter (1930\u20131981)\nAntonio Sinforiano Timotio Luis Fernandes (22 August 1930 \u2013 11 March 1981), known professionally as Antonio Sinforiano or A. Sinforiano, was an Indian playwright, theatrical producer, ghostwriter, composer, prompter, and stagehand known for his work in tiatr productions staged post-liberation.\nEarly life\nAntonio Sinforiano Timotio Luis Fernandes was born on 22 August 1930 in Navelim, Goa, which was part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire, to landlords Concei\u00e7a\u00f5 Manoel Fernandes and Maria Santana Graciana Josefa Rebelo, who hailed from Varca, Goa, into a Goan Catholic family. Fernandes was the fourth of four children, with his elder brothers Gabriel (born 1923) and Jeronimo \"Jerry\" (born 1926), and a sister Maria (born 1928).  After finishing his education at a religious school, Fernandes continued his studies in Marg\u00e3o, where his parents lived. He successfully completed his High School education, known as Segundo Grau, in the Portuguese language.\nCareer\nFernandes, known for his intellectual prowess and accessibility, was regularly sought out by folk playwrights and tiatrists (artists specializing in tiatr performances) to assess and provide feedback on their scripts. This interaction sparked his interest in tiatr, a distinctive form of Goan musical theater. Consequently, Fernandes initiated his involvement in tiatr by authoring scripts, crafting songs, and offering ghostwriting services to tiatrists, demonstrating his multifaceted contributions to the theatrical landscape. Driven by his passion for tiatr, he immersed himself in the world of theatrical productions, taking on the tasks of a prompter and backstage assistant, embodying the role of a stagehand in the theater environment. Fernandes remained dedicated to the Konkani theater scene, commonly referred to as the tiatr stage, by independently creating and presenting his own tiatrs as a theatrical producer. Among his popular works were Rozarachem Kont (The Rosary Beads), directed by Konkani singer and writer Kid Boxer, Maim, Tum Asli Zalear (Mother, If You Were There), Oso Cholta Ho Sounsar (This Is How the World Works), Disop Vortounam Zavop, Map Bhortoch Vot'ta, and others. On 5 November 1972, Fernandes presented his self-written and directed tiatr, Boreponn (Goodness), near Nuvem church. The staging of this tiatr production was made possible with the assistance of the Santos Sports Club. The cast included Babina, Luiza, Clara Dias, Jephsis Hitler, Lucian, Greg de Candolim, Valento Luis Rod, C de Sanquelim, Roam-Rem-Rod, Domnic Vaz, Lume Gomes, C. D'Silva, Master Vaz, Albert de Cana, and J X Miranda. Luciano served as the stage manager, while the music arrangements were executed by Alex's band.\nDuring the period in which Fernandes was active, the Konkani tiatr stage saw a significant reliance on prompters for the delivery of dialogues by performers. These prompters, including Fernandes, were engaged by directors and played a vital role in the production process. Their primary responsibility was to provide timely cues to the performers, ensuring that the lines were delivered accurately and on time. Prompters like Fernandes possessed the ability to convey the precise emotional nuances required for each character, enhancing the overall performance. The demand for prompters of Fernandes' caliber was substantial, and directors would secure their services well in advance, starting from the rehearsal stage and continuing throughout the entire duration of the performances. Fernandes and his contemporaries frequently traveled with the tiatr troupes, joining them as they performed in diverse locations. In addition to their prompting duties, prompters often provided valuable input by offering suggestions and making necessary corrections to the dialogues. The role of prompters extended beyond dialogue delivery. In addition to overseeing the tiatr program, they were in charge of managing stage transitions, coordinating the availability of props, and other essential elements necessary for a successful tiatr performance. Their meticulous attention to detail and careful approach were instrumental in ensuring the smooth and seamless execution of the tiatr show. What made Fernandes stand out among other prompters was his versatility as a writer and composer. In addition to his prompter responsibilities, he possessed the talent to create original content and compose music for the tiatr.\nFernandes played a significant role in fostering and promoting emerging talents within the Konkani tiatr community. One notable individual he supported was Clara Dias, an actress and singer who made her debut on the Konkani stage during the early 1960s. Fernandes offered her encouragement and guidance during the early stages of her career. Moreover, he actively sought to introduce promising artists in his own theatrical productions. For instance, he provided a platform for Josephine Dias, daughter of playwright Casiano, to make her",
    "Former palace in Germany\nSchloss Putbus from the air\nSchloss Putbus\nPutbus Palace (German: Schloss Putbus) is a former neoclassical palace in Putbus, on the isle of R\u00fcgen in Germany. It was the seat of the princes of Putbus and the Putbus family in the city they founded in 1810, Putbus, which is also known as the White city of R\u00fcgen. During the communist period in East Germany, the palace was demolished in 1962 due to political reasons, and the remains were removed by 1964.\nToday, the outline of the building in the green space and the lakeside terrace are still visible. In 2019, an association was founded for the reconstruction of the palace. A feasibility study was presented in November 2023, and the association is now raising public awareness and raising funding.\nPutbus palace is also known as the palace behind the elderberry grove (German: Das Schloss hinter dem Holunderbusch).\nHistory\nSchloss Putbus - Lakeside\nSchloss Putbus - Front\nMiddle ages\nThe first stronghold at Putbus was already there around 1200, in the times when R\u00fcgen was a Danish principality, ruled by the Wends. The Putbus family was a collateral line of the princely house. The name \u2018\u2018Putbus\u2019\u2019 first appeared in 1286 and was adopted by all members of the family in the mid-14th century. With the extinction of the princes of R\u00fcgen in 1325, the family gained a leading role among the noble families of R\u00fcgen. They became the largest land owners on the island of R\u00fcgen, which they remained until the communist takeover after the Second World War.\nThey choose the Putbus stronghold as their main seat and constructed there a stone house, which was mentioned multiple times in documents from around 1371. It was a rectangular solid building located exactly in the middle of an area enclosed by a moat.\nThe documented designation of the building changed in 1416 from \"house\" to \"castle\u201d. In the 15th century, the castle was rebuilt in Gothic style. Between 1584 and 1594, Ludwig von Putbus added the southwestern wing to castle.\n17th and 18th century\nThe 18th century Putbus Palace\nAt the start of the 17th century, the castle was rebuilt into a three-winged complex. The lords of Putbus were created counts of Holy Roman Empire in 1727, and counts in Sweden in 1731.\nIn 1725, count Moritz Ulrich von Putbus (1699\u20131769) renewed the castle in baroque style, with only the Gothic wing and the Renaissance part remaining. Also, he established a park in French formal style, including a belvedere (demolished around 1804/ 1805) and ice cellar (demolished in 1819).\n19th century: Wilhelm Malte I\nWilhelm Malte I zu Putbus, founder of the village\nThe neoclassical Schloss Putbus by Alexander Duncker around 1860\nSchloss Putbus around 1850\nIn 1807, count Wilhelm Malte I von Putbus (1783\u20131854) was created prince (F\u00fcrst) by king Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, Duke of Swedish Pomerania. In 1815, the Prussian king Frederick William III (1770\u20131840) recognized the princely title, after his assumption of power in Swedish Pomerania (now part of the Duchy of Pomerania as a province of Prussia). Wilhelm Malte I was the last governor general of the province of Swedish Pomerania before it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 as New Western Pomerania and R\u00fcgen. He had actually been picked to continue running the affairs of the province under its new rulers.\nIn 1810, Wilhelm Malte founded the town of Putbus next to the palace, and developed it into a luxury seaside resort like Bad Doberan and Heiligendamm. It opened in 1816. The city was designed in neoclassical style and became known as the \"White Town\" (German: Wei\u00dfe Stadt).\nFrom 1827 to 1832, the palace was redesigned by the Berlin architect Johann Gottfried Steinmeyer, who influenced it in the neoclassical style. In addition, from 1819 to 1821, the residence theatre was built and modified in 1826. The princely stables were built between 1821 and 1824, and were home to prince Malte's horses. The palace church was created between 1844 and 1846. And finally, from 1824 to 1853, the prince also constructed an orangery near the palace.\nThe park was also transformed into an English landscape garden. English landscape gardens, as a conscious contrast to the previously dominant French-style baroque gardens, were very popular in Germany towards the end of the 18th and throughout the 19th century. The orchestrated park landscape of trees, bushes, flowers, meadows, water surfaces, paths, and squares was intended to represent an alternative world to the usual harsh reality. The prince resided in Berlin during the winter from 1816 onwards and was also inspired by the ideas of Prussian parks. In 1823, he became a member of the Association for the Promotion of Horticulture in the Royal Prussian States of Prussia (short: Berlin Horticultural Association).\nWilhelm Malte I also constructed the nearby located Granitz Hunting Lodge.\n19th century: Wilhelm Malte II\nWilhelm Malte II zu Putbus\nFront of Schloss Putbus with monument for prince Wilhem Malte ",
    "2002 play by Wole Soyinka\nKing Baabu is a play by Wole Soyinka amongst his others plays including  The Lion and the Jewel,A Dance of the Forests, and The Strong Breed. Wole Soyinka was the first African to win the Nobel Prize award in 1986. King Baabu is a satirical play that mirrors the rule of General Abacha in Nigeria through absurdity and humor. It follows the transformation of General Basha Bash into King Baabu, portraying his  reign with a cast of characters speaking in a childish language. Through comedy and storytelling, the play critiques power, corruption, and the cult of personality, leaving a lasting impression as a poignant commentary on political absurdity.\nPlot\nKing Baabu takes center stage on serving as a mirror reflecting the dictatorial rule of General Basha Bash, a thinly veiled portrayal of Nigeria's General Abacha. The play starts with General Basha Bash, who, following a military coup, sheds his military garb for regal robes and crowns himself King Baabu. With his newfound power, Baabu plunges the nation into a surreal world of  tyranny.\nAs King Baabu's regime runs out of control, the people, once oppressed by General Basha Bash, now find themselves subjected to the whims of a ruler even more absurd and outrageous. Yet, despite the absurdity, they had no choice than to compile\nThrough \"King Baabu,\" Soyinka blends satire, comedy, and social commentary, offering an indictment of dictatorship and the abuse of power. As the curtain falls, the audience is left to ponder the timeless lesson in the theater of politics, absurdity often reigns supreme.\nCharacters\nKing Baabu (formerly General Basha Bash): The central character of the play, a cruel ruler who seizes power in a coup and transforms himself into a flamboyant king.\nPotipoo: The court jester, whose antics provide comic relief throughout the play.\n\u00a0General Uzi: A loyal lackey of King Baabu, known for his blind allegiance and unquestioning obedience.\nSetting\nKing Baabu is set in a fictional version of Nigeria during the rule of General Abacha, although it's more of a satirical commentary than a strict representation of historical events. The story revolves around General Basha Bash, who stages a coup and declares himself King Baabu, symbolizing the arbitrary and dictatorial nature of his rule.\nThe setting reflects the political turmoil and authoritarianism displayed during General Abacha's regime, with parallels drawn between the events in the novel and real-life political dynamics. The use of a childish language for the characters, reminiscent of Alfred Jarry's \"Ubu Roi,\" adds to the satirical tone of the narrative, highlighting the absurdity of the situation.\nThemes\nAuthoritarianism and Dictatorship: The novel explores the consequences of unchecked power and the abuse of authority by depicting General Basha Bash's transformation into King Baabu. It delves into the absurdity and oppression of dictatorial regimes.\nPolitical Satire: Using satire, the novel critiques the political landscape of Nigeria under General Abacha's rule, as well as broader themes of corruption and nepotism in governance. It employs humor and exaggeration to highlight societal issues and political absurdities.\nLanguage and Communication: The use of a childish language for the characters underscores themes of manipulation and propaganda. It reflects how language can be distorted and controlled by those in power to maintain their authority and suppress dissent.\nResistance and Rebellion: Amidst the satire, the novel also touches on themes of resistance and rebellion against oppressive regimes. It portrays characters who challenge the status quo and fight for freedom and justice, despite the absurdity of their circumstances.\n",

    "2024 book by Pak Noja\nPostwar World (Korean:\u00a0\uc804\uc7c1 \uc774\ud6c4\uc758 \uc138\uacc4) is a Korean-language book by Pak Noja, Russian-Korean scholar and professor of University of Oslo. It discusses the impact of the 2022 to present Russian invasion of Ukraine and its impact on the world order.\nContents\nHe argues that major wars between powerful nations tend to happen every 30 to 50 years, as the dominant world order weakens.\nHe points several historical examples:\nThe Napoleonic Wars led to a two-power system with Britain and Russia at the center. But the Crimean War chipped away at Russia's dominance, allowing Britain to take the lead.\nGermany's victory in the Franco-Prussian War challenged Britain, but Germany's defeat in World War I also led to Britain losing its top spot to the United States.\nAfter World War II, the US and the Soviet Union became the two superpowers during the Cold War. But with the Cold War's end, the US emerged as the sole superpower.\nHowever, Park observes that this US-led unipolar system is being challenged by major non-Western powers like China, Russia, and Iran. This is reflected in ongoing conflicts between major powers, such as the Israel-Palestine conflict, the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and the recent war in Ukraine. Park suggests that these events signal a shift towards a new multipolar world order, beginning around 2022.\nAuthor explains the reason why Anti-War movement in russia is relatively small. Unlike South Korea, where a sense of solidarity developed through the democratization movement after the 1980s, Russia experienced the collapse of the Soviet Union and suddenly introduced capitalism.  As a side effect, it is said that social movements have failed to develop because social trust has decreased and distrust of others has increased.\nIn addition, unlike some Korean \"left\" figures who evaluate the Russia-Ukraine war as \"Russia's self-rescue measure against the West\" and the Putin regime as a \"progressive alternative\" to neoliberalism, he strongly criticizes the unethical nature of the Putin regime. The reality of Russia, where the rights of non-regular workers and platform workers are violated and the oppression of democratic unions is fierce, and the massacres, targeted assassinations, illegal confinement, and forced migration committed by the Putin regime in Ukraine are mentioned. But some Korean leftists have positive views on Putin's Russia. He emphasizeds that these illusions must be abandoned. Nevertheless, the author argues that for the peace on the Korean Peninsula, although Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a clearly crime, South Korea must abandon \"blind obedience to the United States\" and restore diplomatic relations with Russia.\nReviews\nReporter Kim Han-byeol of the JoongAng daily agreed with the author's explanation on why the war continues despite the international sanctions against Russia and why support for the war is high within Russia. But he disagree on the argument that for peace on the Korean Peninsula, \"blind obedience to the United States\" must be abandoned and relations with Russia must be restored.\nYang Seon-ah, a reporter for the Hankyoreh newspaper, said that in this book, the Russian author kindly pointed out the ideological identity and goals of the regime deep in the consciousness of the Putin regime. At the same time, it also reported the current status of Russian civil society and wrote that it well explains why there is no noticeable strong anti-war movement or movement against the regime in Russia even though the surveillance and oppression of the Putin regime continues.\nThe left wing Korean newspaper, Redian\u00a0 reviewed that this book will serve as a reliable compass for readers who are curious about what the \u2018postwar world\u2019 will look like and the path Korea should take.\n",
    "Former territorial division of Brazil (1817\u20131821)\nThe Captaincy of Alagoas (Portuguese: Capitania de Alagoas) was created on September 16, 1817, from the dismemberment of the Captaincy of Pernambuco. The capital was located in the current city of Marechal Deodoro under the name of Santa Maria Madalena da Lagoa do Sul.\nHistory\nThe coast of the current state of Alagoas was reached by Portuguese navigators in 1501. At the time, it became a target for European brazilwood smugglers. In 1534, after the Portuguese Crown established the Hereditary Captaincy system for the colonization of Brazil, the territory of Alagoas became part of the Captaincy of Pernambuco. Its occupation dates back to the foundation of the town of Penedo in 1545 by the donat\u00e1rio Duarte Coelho Pereira, located on the banks of the S\u00e3o Francisco River, and to the establishment of sugar mills by the German Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Lins in the southern region of the territory.\nIn 1556, the site witnessed the sinking of the ship Nossa Senhora da Ajuda and the massacre of the survivors, including the bishop Dom Pero Fernandes Sardinha, by the Caet\u00e9 people. The episode provided motivation for the war of extermination waged against the indigenous people by the Portuguese Crown. At the beginning of the 17th century, the Alagoas region produced a significant amount of sugar cane, manioc flour, tobacco, cattle and dried fish. During the second Dutch invasion of Brazil, the coast became the scene of violent fighting. Inland, the quilombos established by Africans escaping from the mills of Pernambuco and Bahia proliferated. Palmares, the most famous, numbered 20,000 people. In 1711, the territory became the Comarca of Alagoas, still subordinate to Pernambuco.\nOn September 16, 1817, after the Pernambuco Revolution, Alagoas achieved independence. The first governor, Sebasti\u00e3o Francisco de Melo e P\u00f3voas, took office on January 22, 1819. The first capital was established in the town of Santa Maria Madalena da Lagoa do Sul, later called Alagoas (now Marechal Deodoro). On February 28, 1821, it became a province. During the Empire, it suffered the effects of movements such as the Confederation of the Equator and the Cabanada. The Provincial Law of December 9, 1839, transferred the capital of the province from the city of Alagoas to the village of Macei\u00f3, which was elevated to city status. In 1889, after the Proclamation of the Republic, it became a state.\nSee also\nCaptaincies of Brazil\nHistory of Alagoas\n",

    "Former labor union of the United States\nThe American League of Colored Laborers was a short-lived labor union established in New York City in 1850. It is notable for being the first union created for African Americans in the United States. Social reformer Frederick Douglass assisted in organizing the group, which held its first meeting at the Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church on June 13, 1850. Its initial officers included Samuel Ringgold Ward as president, Douglass and Lewis Woodson as vice presidents, and Henry Bibb as secretary, and during the first meeting, an executive committee was organized that was composed of several notable social reformers and abolitionists. In addition to union activities, the league was also envisioned to serve as a benefit society for black tradespeople and entrepreneurs, and to this effect, its leaders planned to establish a mutual savings bank and hold an industrial fair. Despite these plans, the union faltered shortly after its creation, and it would take until 1869 that the first successful national labor union for African Americans, the Colored National Labor Union, was formed.\nHistory\nBackground\nIn the pre-Civil War era, many free black workers in the United States faced economic competition from both native-born white Americans and European immigrants, including Irish Americans. Additionally, African Americans were barred access to many labor unions, which only admitted white members. As a result of this, many African Americans formed mutual organizations and benevolent societies in order to assist each other economically. Examples of these organizations include the Coachman's Benevolent Society (established 1825) and the Humane Mechanics (1828) in Philadelphia, the Baltimore Caulker's Association (1838) in Baltimore, and the Colored Sailor's Home (1839) in New York City. According to historian Gerald D. Jaynes in the Encyclopedia of African American Society, these organizations can be considered \"forerunners\" or \"predecessors\" to labor unions, while labor historian Philip S. Foner stated that these groups \"resembled fraternal lodges more than trade unions\".\nFormation\nSamuel Ringgold Ward (pictured c.\u20091855) served as the union's first president.\nOn June 13, 1850, in response to the difficulties faced by African Americans in joining existing labor unions and as part of a wave of efforts towards black economic self-sufficiency and cooperation, several noted social reformers and black activists met at the Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church at the intersection of Leonard Street and Church Street to establish the American League of Colored Laborers (ALCL). The national organization would represent free African Americans who were employed in skilled trades, such as mechanics, and it is considered by historian Lerone Bennett Jr. to be the first labor union established for black people in American history. Social reformer Frederick Douglass was instrumental in establishing the organization, alongside other noted reformers and activists of the era, such as George T. Downing, Charles Bennett Ray, Charles L. Reason, James McCune Smith, and Samuel Ringgold Ward. At the initial meeting, officers for the new group were selected, with Ward as president, Douglass as vice president (a position he shared with Lewis Woodson), and Henry Bibb as secretary. Additionally, an executive committee of 23 members was selected, with plans for this group to meet monthly to discuss league business. Douglass's involvement with the organization, as well as the participation of several editors from African American newspapers, helped the union to garner fairly widespread coverage in the black press.\nGoals\nDespite being a labor union, the league had goals that differentiated it from more traditional organized labor groups. In addition to its goal of promoting unity and cooperation among black mechanics and tradespeople, the union placed a great deal of emphasis on promoting more educational opportunities within the African American community, primarily in the fields of agriculture and industry. Douglass and Ward also envisioned that the league would eventually serve as a loan-giving organization for African American entrepreneurs, and starting with their initial meeting, the union announced plans to establish funds to provide money for people trying to open their own businesses. At an 1851 meeting, the union proposed the establishment of a mutual savings bank. Additionally, the union planned to hold an industrial fair in May 1852 to showcase black industry, with the proceeds from the fair being split between the tradespeople and the union. These goals have led several historians to question how to properly categorize the league.\nDemise\nUltimately, the planned 1852 industrial fair never took place. Ultimately, the ALCL was a short-lived organization, with historian John Ernest writing in 2011 that the league disbanded shortly after its initial meeting and historian Stuart McElderr",
    "Earthquake swarm in Izu Islands, Japan\nThe 2000 Izu Islands earthquakes is an earthquake swarm that occurred around Miyake-jima, K\u014dzu-shima, and Nii-jima in the Izu Islands after 26 June 2000. The largest earthquake was Mw\u202f6.5, and six earthquakes with a maximum JMA seismic intensity of Shindo 6- and Modified Mercalli intensity of VI\u2013VII, resulting in a large-scale earthquake swarm.\nCause\nAn earthquake swarm is believed to be strongly related to volcanic activity on Miyake-jima. When seismic activity began around 18:30 JST (09:30 UTC) on 26 June, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued an volcanic information announcement at 19:33 JST (10:33 UTC) on the same day, calling for caution regarding volcanic eruptions on Miyake-jima. However, there was no immediate eruption on Miyake-jima, and the next day, discoloration of seawater believed to be caused by submarine volcanic eruptions was confirmed about 1 km off the west coast of Miyake-jima. It was believed that the seismic activity moved northwestward and the possibility of an eruption on Miyake-jima decreased, but on 8 July, an eruption occurred at the summit of Miyake-jima. The depression grew with frequent phreatic eruptions to a 550m\u2013deep\u2013caldera with adiameter of about 1,600 m. There were small eruptions on 13 August, 14, and on 18 August, the largest eruption occurred, followed by the second largest eruption on 29 August, leading to the evacuation of all residents on the island.\nSeismic activity\nFrom around 18:30 JST (09:30 UTC) on 26 June 2000, small-scale seismic activity began with the epicenter located in the southwest of Miyake-jima. On the 27th, the epicenter shifted to the west of Miyake-jima offshore. The seismic activity also spread northwestward and intensified. From late June to August, it became significant seismic activity in the waters off the west coast of Miyake-jima, as well as near Nii-jima and K\u014dzu-shima. There were 30 earthquakes with a maximum JMA seismic intensity of Shindo 5- or higher (Shindo 6- occurred 6 times, Shindo 5+ occurred 7 times, and Shindo 5- occurred 17 times). The total number of earthquakes reached 14,200. Seismic activity gradually subsided after September.\nImpact\nThe earthquake swarm caused collapsed houses and landslides on Nii-jima, K\u014dzu-shima, Shikine-jima, and Miyake-jima. The July 1 earthquake killed one person in a landslide at K\u014dzu-shima Village. This was the first fatality caused by an earthquake in Japan since the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. It also injured 15 people, destroyed 15 houses, severely damaged 20 others and damaged 174 more.\nSee also\nList of earthquakes in 2000\nList of earthquakes in Japan\n",
    "Species of scale insect\nFiorinia phantasma, the phantasma scale, is an invasive and polyphagous scale insect, apparently native to parts of south-eastern Asia and some Pacific islands. It has invaded other parts of the Pacific, Asia, the Indian Ocean, Europe and the Americas, spreading with the trade of ornamental plants. It has caused serious outbreaks on palm trees, but also infests various other woody plants, including a number of ornamentals and fruit trees like mango or lychee.\nDistribution\nFiorinia phantasma was described from the Philippines in 1915, where it had been collected from Neolitsea. The first documented occurrence outside the Philippines and the first case of invasion was reported from the Hawaii Islands, where heavy infestations were reported from Oahu Island on Ligustrum japonicum in 2004, and on Pittosporum tobira in 2008. Subsequently, it was collected from 15 other plants, including a serious infestation on areca palms in 2011 on Maui Island.\nF. phantasma was again described as Fiorinia coronata from the Solomon Islands in 1988, where it infested coconut palms. It has been subsequently reported as an introduced pest from different parts of the world and seems to spread easily through the international trade with ornamental plants. It is now recorded as widespread in south-eastern Asia (southern China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), on various Pacific islands from Papua New Guinea in the west to French Polynesia in the east, on several islands in the Indian Ocean (Maldives, Reunion), and on indoor or glasshouse plants from parts of Europe (France, Netherlands, U.K.).\nIn the Americas it has been reported from several Caribbean islands (Saint Martin, Grenada) and has also invaded Florida on the U.S. mainland. In Florida, it was first recorded as causing a serious infestation on Canary Island date palms (Phoenix canariensis) in 2018, and was later also reported from other palms and various ornamentals.\nDescription\nThe scale cover excreted by the second instar females of F. phantasma is elongated, about 1.2 mm long and light to dark brown with a weakly developed longitudinal ridge. The body of the adult female inside the 2nd instar exuviae is wide at the thorax, but narrows abruptly at body segment III, tapering to a narrow, almost pointed pygidium at the posterior end. The body of the adult female may be yellowish, reddish or may have reddish transverse stripes. Male scales have a white scale cover like in several other species of Fiorinia.\nAdult female of Fiorinia phantasma - a) antenna detail and inter-antennal process; b) anterior spiracle; c) microducts; d) marginal duct tubercles; e) marginal microduct; f) details of pygidium; g) marginal macroduct on pygidium.\nThere are several morphologically similar species of Fiorinia which cannot be separated by their scale covers or their host plants. For example, in North America Fiorinia phantasma is very similar to Fiorinia fioriniae and both commonly infest ornamental palms. However, as of 2024, F. phantasma has been only reported from Florida. For a reliable identification of F. phantasma, a slide mount and microscopic examination of the morphological details is required using the available keys. For routine field surveys, a temporary slide mount may be sufficient.\nBiology\nFiorinia phantasma is polyphagous and infests the underside of the leaves, but might spread to the upper side in dense populations. It has been mainly reported from tropical woody ornamental plants, especially palm trees. ScaleNet list 25 plant families and 54 plant genera as host plants, the large majority of them from the family Arecaceae (palm trees). Infested crops include cultivated palms like coconut and areca palms, as well as fruit trees like mango or lychee.\nAs with other scale insects, only the first instar, the crawler stage, is mobile and can move to other parts of the host plant or spread by wind. The crawlers settle after a few days and start feeding on the leaves with their piercing and sucking mouthparts. The scale feeds mainly on parenchymal cells or vascular bundle tissue. Females only moult twice, to the second instar nymph and to the adult female which remains within the exuviae of the 2nd instar. Males have 2 additional instars.\nLong distance spread happens by human transport of host plants. F. phantasma is often intercepted by quarantine and also spreads frequently during the distribution of nursery plants.\nDamage and management\nSerious outbreaks have been mainly reported during the first years after an introduction of Fiorinia phantasma into a new area. Infested leaves become yellow (chlorosis), they drop prematurely, and host plants may wilt and die due to the attack. In the Maldives, approximately 6000 coconut palms were heavily infested on one island, affecting fruit production. Nurseries of ornamental plants may be seriously affected, promoting spread of the pest.\nManagement of infestations is difficult, due to t",
    "Major public transit station in Detroit, Michigan\nThe Jason Hargrove Transit Center (JHTC) is a major public transit station in Detroit, Michigan, United States. It is the third iteration of the State Fair Transit Center, located at the old Michigan State Fairgrounds, near the intersection of 8 Mile Road and Woodward Avenue. It serves as the secondary hub for the Detroit Department of Transportation bus network, as well as a major transfer point for the suburban SMART network, served by 13 bus routes between the systems.\nThe JHTC repurposes the former Dairy Cattle Building, the last remaining structure from the Michigan State Fair at the site.\nServices\nServices from the transit center include 13 bus routes, 10 of which terminate at the station. As of May\u00a02024, the transit center is expected to serve 25,000 passengers per week.\nHistory\nFairgrounds\nThe Michigan State Fairgrounds, an approximately 160-acre (65\u00a0ha) site at 8 Mile Road and Woodward Avenue, hosted the annual Michigan State Fair from 1905 to 2009. The fair went on hiatus in 2009 amidst funding difficulties, and returned in 2012 at a different site. Under the administration of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, the northwestern portion of the site was redeveloped into a shopping center, anchored by a Meijer store. Additional redevelopment proposals were made in the late 2010s, and much of the site was redeveloped for industrial uses by 2023.\nThe redevelopment of the State Fairgrounds was controversial. Following the construction of the shopping center, the proposals to redevelop the rest of the site for industrial use were met with resistance. Preservationists highlighted the historic value of the buildings on the site, which included the Michigan State Fairgrounds Coliseum, the Dairy Cattle Building, and a historic band shell. In 2021, the plans for the State Fairgrounds redevelopment were revised, which included retaining the Dairy Cattle Building as a new transit center, and relocating the band shell to Palmer Park. The Coliseum was demolished in 2022.\nTransit center\nThe original State Fair Transit Center, located at what is now the corner of Woodward Avenue and Remington Street, had existed since the era of the Department of Street Railways, and was once served by streetcars. Amid construction at the Fairgrounds site, which necessitated a new access street, the original Transit Center closed permanently on November 6, 2022, with only one week of public notice, and was demolished soon thereafter. A new, temporary transit center entered service the next day.\nConstruction on the new transit center began in May 2023, with extensive interior demolition of the Dairy Cattle Building. The station features a heated indoor lobby, with a ticket office and vending machine, public restrooms, and artifacts preserved from the Coliseum, including a sign, stadium seats, and a scoreboard.\nNamesake\nThe transit center is named for DDOT bus driver Jason Hargrove, who died in April 2020 from complications of COVID-19. Hargrove, a father of six, had worked for DDOT since 2016, and was an active member of the Amalgamated Transit Union. He gained national attention from a viral video he posted on Facebook, in which he described being coughed on by a careless passenger, and advocated for stronger protections for DDOT bus drivers in the then-early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hargrove's video was the subject of national media coverage, highlighting the serious nature of the COVID-19 crisis, and its effect on frontline workers.\n",

    "\nThe 11th Federal Assembly of United Left was held in Madrid from 4 June to 5 June 2016, to renovate the governing bodies of United Left (IU) and establish the party's main lines of action and strategy for the next leadership term. A primary election to elect the new general coodinator of the party was held from 26 May to 29 May 2016. This was the first leadership election in IU's history in which all the party members were allowed to vote.\nThe congress was held just before the 2016 Spanish general election, which IU contested in a coalition with Podemos. This decision produced an internal rift, leaving the party divided into three factions. The first one was composed of incumbent General Coordinator Cayo Lara and members of the old guard who were radically against any alliance with Podemos. The second was led by IU's spokesman in the Congress of Deputies Alberto Garz\u00f3n\u2014who was contesting the general election for Unidos Podemos\u2014and received the support of the majority sector of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and of most of the IU federations. The third sector was made up of members of Open Left (IzAb), the party led by former general coordinator Gaspar Llamazares, a longtime critic of Lara's leadership.\nThe leadership election saw a generational renovation with Garz\u00f3n becoming the new general coordinator in a landslide as he received 74.7% of the members vote. Meanwhile, the candidacy of Paloma L\u00f3pez Bermejo\u2014supported by Lara and the old guard\u2014received 20.8% of the vote and the candidate of IzAb, Tasio Oliver, finished last with just 4.6% of support.\nCandidates\nEndorsements\nTotal\nCandidates seeking to run were required to collect the endorsements of at least 400 party members or 5% of the total Federal Political Council (CPF) members.\nPublic endorsements\nAlberto Garz\u00f3n\nAlberto Garz\u00f3n's endorsements\nMarina Albiol, Member of the European Parliament for Spain (since 2014), Member of the Corts Valencianes (2007\u20132014)\nJos\u00e9 Luis Centella, Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Spain (since 2009), Member of the Congress of Deputies for M\u00e1laga and Seville (1993\u20132004 and 2011\u20132015)\nYolanda D\u00edaz, National Coordinator United Left Galicia (since 2005), Member of the Congress of Deputies for A Coru\u00f1a (since 2016), Member of the Parliament of Galicia for A Coru\u00f1a (2012\u20132016)\nJoan Josep Nuet, National Coordinator of United and Alternative Left (since 2012), Member of the Parliament of Catalonia for Barcelona (since 2015), Member of the Congress of Deputies for Barcelona (2011\u20132015)\nToni Valero, Secretary of Organization and Finance of United Left/The Greens\u2013Assembly for Andalusia (since 2013)\nPaloma L\u00f3pez Bermejo\nPaloma L\u00f3pez Bermejo's endorsements\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Garc\u00eda Rubio, Federal Secretary of Economy and Employment of IU (since 2012)\nFrancisco Guarido, Mayor of Zamora (since 2015), City Councillor of Zamora (since 1999)\nCayo Lara, General Coordinator of United Left (since 2008), Member of the Congress of Deputies for Madrid (2011\u20132016)\nDiego Valderas, Vice President of the Regional Government of Andalusia (2012\u20132015), General Coordinator of United Left/The Greens\u2013Assembly for Andalusia (2000\u20132013), President of the Parliament of Andalusia (1994\u20131996), Member of the Parliament of Andalusia for Huelva (1986\u20132000 and 2008\u20132015)\n\u00c1ngela Vallina, Member of the European Parliament for Spain (since 2014), Mayor of Castrill\u00f3n (2003\u20132004 and 2007\u20132014)\nTasio Oliver\nTasio Oliver's endorsements\nTeresa Araguren, Member of the Board of Directors of RTVE (since 2007)\nGaspar Llamazares, General Coordinator of United Left (2008\u20132016), Member of the Congress of Deputies for Asturias and Madrid (2000\u20132015)\nPolitical Parties\nOpen Left (IzAb)\n\u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Manche\u00f1o\n\u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Manche\u00f1o's endorsements\nPolitical Parties\nUnitarian Candidacy of Workers (CUT)\nResults\n",
    "Brazilian group of artists and researchers\nThe Huni Kuin Artists Movement (MAHKU) is a group composed of Huni Kuin artists and researchers, an indigenous people living in the Brazilian Amazon, between the state of Acre and Peru. The group's origins are linked to Ib\u00e3 Sales Huni Kuin's research on the Huni Meka, ayahuasca chants in the H\u00e3txa Kuin language. The artists seek to transform and create bridges with the non-indigenous through murals, drawings, and paintings, hence building alliances and strengthening their own strategies of autonomy. The group is constituted by founder Ib\u00e3 Huni Kuin, K\u00e1ssia Borges, Acelino Tuin, Cleiber Bane, Pedro Man\u00e1, Yaka Huni Kuin, Rita Huni Kuin, Cleudo Txana Tuin, and Isaka Huni Kuin, represented by the Carmo Johnson Projects gallery\nHistory\nIn the early 2000s, leaders amongst the Huni Kuin people, especially Ib\u00e3, began conducting workshops to translate Huni Kuin chants, myths and practices into drawings, involving his son Bane, nephew Acelino and relative Man\u00e1. Many of MAHKU's works are visual translations and interpretations of Huni Meka chants, traditional knowledge accompanying Nixi Pae rituals utilizing ayahuasca, a tea composed of amazonian vegetation with hallucinogenic potential, used for centuries by varied South American tribes.\nIn Huni Kuin iconography, the area of uncertainty between dreams and myths is often depicted through geometric framing that is adapted according to the artwork's structure and imagery, guaranteeing free expression and autonomy within a non-linear story. Within the Mira\u00e7\u00e3o(vision's) perimeter, there are no hierarchies between the represented beings, as the threshold between abstraction and figuration loses all meaning. What we find is the result of an image-process, stemming from dialogue and learning among those involved, whose ultimate goal is healing, both for the artist and the observer interpreting it, allowing a spiritual experience.\nThe group seeks to build bridges between indigenous and non-indigenous worlds, between the visible and the invisible. Through partaking in exhibitions, the group has found sustainable paths in extending traditional lifestyle, setting in motion alligators, snakes, and vine teas, therefore disseminating its myths, stories, and art.\nIn 2012, Ib\u00e3, along with anthropologist Amilton Pelegrino de Mattos, professor at the Federal University of Acre, decided that the group's work had the means to expand beyond Acre, creating a blog and sharing it with those who might be captivated by indigenous culture, not limited to other anthropologists. In the same year, the blog reached both curator and anthropologist Bruce Albert, and artistic director Herv\u00e9 Chand\u00e8s at Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain, inviting the founder to participate in Histoires de voir, Show and Tell.\nIn 2014, MAHKU's work was selected for the exhibition Made by... Made by Brazilians, curated by Marc Pottier, at the former Matarazzo Hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo. Ib\u00e3, Bane, and Isaka painted panels on the walls of three rooms and, at the end of the event, sold their first piece, a 5-meter canvas. The proceeds from this sale were invested in the purchase of the first 125 acres of land. Since then, they have sold about 15 works, but in smaller sizes and values, and more lands have been bought.\nIn 2017, the collective launched at the 35th Panorama of Brazilian Art, curated by Luiz Camillo Osorio, the Ib\u00e3 Huni Kuin Wall Project(Isa\u00edas Sales), who is a txana, master of chants in the tradition of the Huni Kuin people. This led to the creation of The Spirit of the Forest Project, curated by Ib\u00e3 and his son, exploring the Huni Kuin imaginary through unorthodox storytelling given western parameters.\nIn 2018, the exhibition Through the Poetics of MAHKU was held with artists Ib\u00e3 Huni Kuin and Bane Huni Kuin. Curated by Roberta Paredes and Amilton Pelegrino, the works exhibited at the Arts Gallery of the Federal University of Amazonas were part of the Spirit of the Forest project collection.\nIn 2020, they launched the exhibition Vaiv\u00e9m at the Bank of Brazil's Cultural Center, in Belo Horizonte. Curated by Raphael Fonseca, the produced canvas was inspired by the concept the exhibition's central theme; that peoples emerge from intricate social webs, that cycles of life and death occur in such webs, and that their existence allow for the survival of traditions, as Amerindian culture is narrated through webs of storytelling, acting as a societal cornerstone.\nIn 2021, Carmo Johnson Projects Gallery began representing MAHKU, presenting work in the exhibition Everything is Dangerous, Divine, and Wonderful, curated by Daniel Dinato. The demonstration sought to engage in dialogue between the collective's representation of ancestral strength in myths and chants with Bruno Novelli's hybrid imaginary of beasts and tropical landscapes.\nIn 2022, they launched the exhibition Chants of Images, curated by Ib\u00e3 Huni Kuin and Daniel Donato, being co-produced between Casa de Cultura do",
    "French-Tunisian magician, painter, actor, author and former pickpocket\nHenry Kassagi (born Abd El-ma\u01e7\u012bd al-Qa\u1e63\u02bfA\u01e7\u012b, 28 September 1932\u00a0\u2013 23 June 1997), known as Kassagi, was a Franco-Tunisian magician, painter, actor, author and former pickpocket.\nCareer\nHenri Kassagi was born Abd El-ma\u01e7\u012bd al-Qa\u1e63\u02bfA\u01e7\u012b in Halfaouine, a district of Tunis. At the age of 12 he witnessed a magic trick and from that moment knew his vocation: he had already trained his hands in dexterity by pickpocketing in the streets of Tunis.\nAt the start of the 1950s, he left Tunisia for Paris, where he continued to earn his living as a pickpocket. There he met the film director Robert Bresson, who gave him the position of technical advisor to perfect the actions of the thieves in the film Pickpocket, as well as appearing as instructor and accomplice to the main character.\nAfter Pickpocket, Kassagi's face and techniques were too well known for him to continue with his old trade, and he changed career to become a stage magician. In the following years, he made a name for himself in the world of magic shows and conjuring in France and around the world. His speciality resembled the technique of pickpockets, described in the Grand Larousse encyclop\u00e9dique.\nKassagi appeared in photo comics published in the magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9 Poche, and was invited to appear in television shows such as T\u00e9l\u00e9 Dimanche\u00a0. He was successful and made several world tours.\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, he bought the house of the priest of Bonnefoi in Orne, which he restored.\nHis career declined at the end of the 1970s. In 1981 he decided to return to his native country, intending to build an entertainment centre including a casino, a restaurant, an exhibition hall, a nightclub and a theatre in Hammamet. This ambitious project did not come to fruition and he returned to France.\nPersonal life\nHis first wife was his French assistant H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Chauvel, the mother of their son Dominique (born 1956). After their divorce, Kassagi met a German woman, Marion K\u00f6nig, in Berlin during an engagement In the city. She became his assistant on and behind the stage, and they married on 29 February 1980. In the same year their daughter Vanina was born. They separated in 1991 and the divorce was finalised later.\nKassagi died at the age of 64 in his apartment at 6, boulevard Jourdan in the 14th arrondissement of Paris and was found on 23 June 1997. The forensic pathologist attributed the death to cerebral infarction, which had occurred three or four weeks before the discovery of the body. A funeral at P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery was organised by his ex-wife Marion and his daughter; however, after the intervention of his Tunisian family and son and the Consulate General of Tunisia in Paris, his body was transferred to Tunisia. He is buried at the Djellaz cemetery in Tunis.\nFimography\nPickpocket (1959)\nNavarro (TV series), season 7, 1995: episode 2 \u2013 \"Coup bas\"\n",
    "\nBajirao's Konkan campaign  usually referred as Janjira campaign  or Janjira War\nThe succession war after the death of Sidi Rasul Yakut in February 1733 ignited a complex and protracted conflict for control over Janjira, marked by intrigue, shifting alliances, and external interventions. Abdulla, the rightful heir, found himself challenged by his own kin, including his son Sidi Rahman, amidst the ambitions of rebellious governors like Shaikh Yakub Khan. The situation escalated with the involvement of the Marathas, led by Baji Rao and later joined by the Pratinidhi, in a campaign against the Sidis. Despite initial successes, including the conquest of key fortresses, the conflict endured due to the resilience of Janjira fortress and external support sought by the Sidis from European powers and regional rulers\nBackground\nJanjira State in the Imperial Gazetteer of India\nThe death of Sidi Rasul Yakut in February 1733 triggered a civil war for succession in his kingdom. His son Abdulla, the rightful heir, faced challenges from his brothers and even his own son Sidi Rahman. The situation worsened with the rebellious governors, particularly Shaikh Yakub Khan, who was ambitious and had a Hindu convert background. Intrigues by Prabhu Sardar Yashwant Rao  further fueled the internal conflict, leading to Sidi Rahman and Shaikh Yakub Khan aligning with the Marathas. Baji Rao was tasked by Shahu to lead the expedition against the Sidis, with FattehSingh Bhosale joining later.\nCampaign\nBaji Rao seized the fortresses of Tala and Ghosala in the Konkan, then clashed with Saikhoji Angre at Dandrajpuri. Siddi Abdulla was killed at Janjira, prompting a siege. Despite efforts by Baji Rao and Manaji Angre, the fortress held, with the Siddi seeking help from the Portuguese, English, Mughals, and Nizam. Marathas raided various places, but outside aid was limited. The Portuguese sent ships under the guise of mediation, the Mughals urged English assistance, but focused on trade. Ultimately, the siege ended without resolution\nThe Pratinidhi, led by Anand Rao Sarlaskar and Krishnaji Dabhade, joined Baji Rao's campaign on May 20. However, Baji Rao's enthusiasm waned upon their arrival. Despite this, the Pratinidhi's clever intrigues led to the conquest of Raigad on June 8, 1733. Bankaji Naik further strengthened the Maratha cause by capturing Bankot and Mandangad fortresses, then defeating the Sidi at Goalkot on July 8. Although the Sidi fled to the fortress, they did not surrender.\nBy July, most of the Sidi's dominions had fallen to the Marathas, alarming the English who had suffered from Angre's actions. They sent a battleship to aid the Sidi against Angre's siege on Underi island, but failed. In September, another squadron was dispatched, coinciding with Saikhoji Angre's death, leading to internal conflicts among the Marathas. Shahu refrained from appointing a single Commander-in-Chief, causing a loss of command at sea to the Sidi and the English, who formed an alliance. The Nizam supported the Sidi, prompting Chimnaji Appa to stay in Poona. Additionally, conflicts between Maratha factions and indifference from allies led to a decline in Maratha activities. Despite attempts to take Janjira, quarrels between the Angre brothers appeared to be failure of the Konkan campaign.\nIn December 1733, realizing the challenges including loss of sea control and lack of cooperation, BajiRao sought an honorable peace, recognizing Abdul Rahman as chief of Janjira. Despite this, tensions persisted, leading to ongoing conflict. Efforts to remove Sidi Sat from Anjanwel and Goalkot were hindered by quarrels and lack of siege equipment. In 1736, Shahu dispatched Chimnaji Appa to halt Sidi Sat's aggression. A decisive battle ensued on April 19, resulting in Sidi Sat's defeat and death, along with Sidi Yakub, the fort commandant.\nResult\nIn 1736, the Marathas secured victory at a high cost, leading to the death of Siddi Sat and easing Brahmendra Swami and Shahu's concerns. Siddi Rahmakh of Janjira proposed peace terms, ending the war on the condition of friendship with the Peshwa. Despite retaining control of Anjanwel and Goalkot, the Siddi's power declined, confirming the Peshwa's supremacy in the Konkan. The Peshwa's dominance was further solidified due to internal conflicts within the Angre family, which weakened their position. Baji Rao seized the opportunity to intervene in the Angre quarrel, dividing authority and possessions between Sambhaji and Manaji Angre, ultimately diminishing the Angre's strength and resources.\nMaratha Portuguese relations after and during the Campaign\nMain articles: Luso\u2013Maratha War (1729\u20131732) and Battle of Vasai\nFirst Phase\nBy 1736, Baji Rao had significantly weakened the Sidi and Angre powers, leaving only the Portuguese as a concern. The Portuguese had intervened in domestic disputes among the Angre brothers, aggravating tensions with the Marathas. Their power, established in India since 1498, had declined by the late 17th ",

    "2008 studio album by Roy Hargrove Quintet\nEarfood is a jazz album by the Roy Hargrove Quintet, issued by the EmArcy record label in 2008. The album was a return to Hargrove's enduring interest in hard bop, following several albums in which he explored jazz within a hip-hop and R&B context.\nEarfood is notable for the inclusion of the composition, Strasbourg / St. Denis, which has since emerged as a modern-day jazz standard.\nReception\nCritical perspectives of Earfood were largely positive upon its release. Writing for The New York Times, jazz critic Nate Chinen selected Earfood as his critics' choice. Chinen declared the album to \"attest to a classic jazz ideal\" while \"rarely sound as if  stepped out of a time machine\". Chinen attributed this to Hargrove's successful merging of his \"hard-bop and groove-orientated sides\". Hargrove's success at melding hard-bop with modern jazz was also observed in a positive AllAboutJazz review, which noted Hargrove's success was \"redefining the hard bop of the 1950s and 1960s through the post bop lense of the 1980s and 1990s\".\nSome jazz critics, though enthused by Hargrove's approach to Earfood, were less so by its execution, with John Fordham from The Guardian describing the exceptional musicianship as creating an \"atmosphere of infallibility\" and giving the session an \"unjazzy character\". This criticism was noted elsewhere, with others assessing the overall feel of the album to be \"too sterile\".\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Roy Hargrove except as indicated.\n\"I'm Not So Sure\" (Cedar Walton)\u2013 5:46\n\"Brown\" \u2013 4:30\n\"Strasbourg / St. Denis\" \u2013 4:38\n\"Starmaker\" (Lou Marini) - 7:54\n\"Joy Is Sorrow Unmasked\" \u2013 4:46\n\"The Stinger\" - 4:57\n\"Rouge\" - 2:46\n\"Mr. Clean\" (Weldon Irvine Jr.)- 5:51\n\"Style\" - 6:35\n\"Divine\" \u2013 5:10\n\"To Wisdom The Prize\" (Larry Willis) - 5:43\n\"Speak Low\" (Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash) \u2013 5:16\n\"Bring It On Home To Me (Sam Cooke) \u2013 3:00\nPersonnel\nMusicians\nRoy Hargrove  \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn\nJustin Robinson  \u2013 alto saxophone, flute\nGerald Clayton  \u2013 piano\nDanton Boller  \u2013 bass\nMontez Coleman  \u2013 drums\nProduction\nLarry Clothier \u2013 producer\nRoy Hargrove - producer\nJacques Muyal - executive producer\nAl Schmitt - recorded & mixed\nSteve Genewick - engineer\n",
    "Conservative magazine in Turkey (1939\u20131982)\nHareket (Turkish: Action) was a monthly conservative political magazine which was published between 1939 and 1982 in Turkey with some interruptions. The magazine is known for its support of the Anadoluculuk (Turkish: Anatolianism) approach.\nHistory and profile\nHareket was established by Nurettin Top\u00e7u, a conservative intellectual, in Izmir in 1939. The first issue of the magazine appeared in February 1939. Its title was a reference to the action theory of Maurice Blondel who was the teacher of Top\u00e7u. The magazine was edited by Nurettin Top\u00e7u. From the sixth issue the headquarters of the magazine moved to Istanbul.\nHareket temporarily ceased publication in May 1943 and was restarted in March 1947. Its publication again ended in June 1949. The magazine was revived in December 1952, but ended publication June 1953. The magazine was restarted in January 1966 and continued its publication until March 1977. The magazine was again restarted in March 1979 and permanently folded in March 1982 after producing a total of 187 issues.\nBoth the title and subtitle of the magazine were changed during its run. It was Hareket: Fikir-Sanat (Turkish: Action: Idea-Art) between February 1939 and May 1943. Its subtitle was Fikir-Ahlak-Sanat (Turkish: Idea-Ethics-Art) from March 1947 to June 1949 and Ayl\u0131k Siyasi Mecmua (Turkish: Monthly Political Journal) from December 1952 to January 1953. Then it was redesigned as Ayl\u0131k Fikir Mecmuas\u0131 (Turkish: Monthly Journal of Ideas) in February 1953 and was used until June 1953. The magazine was renamed as Fikir ve Sanatta Hareket (Turkish: Action in Art and Idea) in January 1966, and that title was employed until its closure in March 1982.\nContributors\nTop\u00e7u published many articles in Hareket and discussed metaphysical and practical issues about the state and social structure that the Turkish nation should have. Major contributors of Hareket included Mehmet Kaplan, Hilmi Ziya \u00dclken, Ahmet Kabakl\u0131, Ali Fuat Ba\u015fgil, \u0130smail Kara, Be\u015fir Ayvazo\u011flu, M\u00fckrimin Halil Y\u0131nan\u00e7, S\u00fcleyman Uluda\u011f, Ayhan Songar, Halit Refi\u011f, Ya\u015far Nuri \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, Orhan Okay, Mustafa Kara, Cemil Meri\u00e7, Emin I\u015f\u0131k, H\u00fcseyin Hatemi, H\u00fcsrev Hatemi, Ziyaeddin Fahri F\u0131nd\u0131ko\u011flu, Ali Bula\u00e7, H\u00fcseyin Batuhan and Remzi O\u011fuz Ar\u0131k.\nContent and views\nHareket featured articles by Turkish writers and thinkers. In addition, it published interviews and translations of the work by Western and Eastern writers, including Stefan Zweig, Oscar Wilde, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Ren\u00e9 Wellek, Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore, Jacques Pr\u00e9vert, Edgar Allan Poe, Blaise Pascal, Charles P\u00e9guy, Frederick Mayer, Andr\u00e9 Maurois, Irving Kristol, Karl Jaspers, Immanuel Kant, Victor Hugo, Charles Baudelaire, Raymond Aron, Julien Benda, Anton Chekhov, Miguel de Unamuno, Will Durant, Mahatma Gandhi and Andr\u00e9 Gide.\nSince its early issues, Hareket attached new meanings to the concepts of religion, nationalism, social order and revolution which differed from the official views. It promoted an understanding of nationalism which was different from Ziya G\u00f6kalp's nationalism. For Hareket a national history existed within the borders of Anatolia, and this approach is called Anadoluculuk (Turkish: Anatolianism). In this approach Turkishness develops within Islam.\nAlthough Hareket was a political publication, it did not support any political party.\n",

    "2nd century chieftain of the Xianbei State\nTanshihuai (136\u2013181) was a Xianbei chieftain who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty period of China. It was under Tanshihuai when the Xianbei became a unified polity and posed a constant threat to the Han dynasty's northern borders for many years. After his death, however, his state quickly fell apart as his grandsons failed to maintain the support of the tribes.\nLife\nEarly life and rise\nTanshihuai's mother was the wife of a man named Touluhou (\u6295\u9e7f\u4faf). While Touluhou was serving in the Xiongnu army for three years, his wife gave birth to him at home. When he returned, Touluhou believed Tanshihuai to be the product of an affair and wanted to kill him before his wife intervened. She claimed that while she was out in the day, she had heard the sound of a thunderstorm. When she looked up, a piece of hail fell into her mouth, and she became pregnant with Tanshihuai after she swallowed it. Although Touluhou did not believe her, he decided not to kill him, only forcing her to send him away. The wife secretly gave Tanshihuai to her parents for them to raise.\nAs Tanshihuai was growing up, he was described as brave, strong and resourceful. At the age of 14 or 15, a leader from a different tribe robbed his grandfather's cattles and horses. On horseback, Tanshihuai chased them down and recovered all the stolen animals, which made him renown among his people. As an adult, his laws and judgements were fair, and his followers did not object to them, so he was elected to be the main leader of his tribe. He moved his base to Mount Danhan (\u5f48\u6c57\u5c71; in present-day Shangdu County, Inner Mongolia), where he built a court on the banks of the Jieqiu River (\u6b60\u4ec7\u6c34).\nTanshihuai's soldiers and horses were strong, and many of the tribes in the east and west submitted to him. He conducted raids on the Han dynasty's borders and blocked the Dingling's encroachment from the north. He also repelled Buyeo's attacks from the east and attacked the Wusun in the west. His territory was comparable to the former Xiongnu empire, covering more than 14,000 li from east to west and 7,000 li from north to south including mountains, rivers, swamps and salt lakes.\nWar with the Han dynasty\nIn 156, Tanshihuai led around three to four thousand cavalry to invade the Han dynasty's Yunzhong County. He led more attacks on the Han's northern borders in 158, 159 and 163. In 166, the Xianbei allied with the Southern Xiongnu and Wuhuan to attack nine border commanderies, plundering them and killing many of the local officials and people. The Han sent the general, Zhang Huan, to attack them, and the Xianbei withdrew from the border fortresses. Fearing their inability to restrain him, the Han sent their envoys with official seals and ribbons to Tanshihuai, offering him the title of King in hopes of reaching a peace agreement. However, Tanshihuai rejected them and only intensified his intrusion.\nTanshihuai divided his domain into three sections; from Youbeiping to the east up to Liaodong, encompassing over twenty cities including the Buyeo and Yemaek tribes, formed the eastern part. From Youbeiping to the west up to Shanggu, including over ten cities, formed the central part. From Shanggu to the west up to Dunhuang and the Wusun, including over twenty cities, formed the western part. Each section was governed by a chieftain appointed by Tanshihuai, who swore fealty to him.\nDuring the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, the Xianbei attacked the border commanderies of You, Bing and Liang provinces, leaving countless dead and devastating the regions. In 177, the Han launched a counterattack on the Xianbei. They sent the generals Xia Yu, Tian Yan and Zang Min, along with the Southern Xiongnu chanyu, Tute Ruoshi Zhujiu to venture beyond the Great Wall. The Han army marched over 2,000 li before facing Tanshihuai in battle and were heavily defeated. Only one-tenth of the Han army returned safely, and later that winter, the Xianbei raided Liaoxi.\nIn 178, the Xianbei raided Jiuquan Commandery. At the time, the Xianbei population had grew to the point that farming, herding and hunting alone could not longer sustain them. Therefore, Tanshihuai went to the Wuhouqin River (\u70cf\u4faf\u79e6\u6c34; modern-day Laoha River, Liaoning) to promote fishing, but initially had no success. Hearing that the Han people (\u6c57\u4eba, not to be confused with \u6f22\u4eba Han people) were excellent fishers, he led his cavalry to attack them in the east and captured thousands of them. He relocated them to live along the Wuhouqin River to fish for the Xianbei and alleviate their food shortage. While the earlier Records of the Three Kingdoms refer to these captured people as \"Han people\", the later Book of the Later Han refer to them as \"Wa people\" (\u502d\u4eba), with \"Wa\" being an old term for Japan. K. H. J. Gardiner and Rafe de Crespigny reason that it is feasible that \"Han people\" refers to the people of Panhan county (\u756a\u6c57\u7e23) in Liaodong Commandery, which was well within Tanshihuai's area of influence, and",
    "Portrait by Amalia Lindegren\nFriedrich Wilhelm Meves (April 14, 1814 \u2013 April 9, 1891) was a German naturalist, ornithologist and entomologist. He worked as a curator of birds at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. He experimentally demonstrated cosmetic colouration in lammergeiers and mechanical sound production involved in the drumming displays of snipes.\nLife and work\nMeves was born in Delligsen, in the duchy of Braunschweig to pastor Ludvig Christian Friedrich and Augusta Wilhelmine n\u00e9e L\u00fcders. Even as a child he took an interest in insects while his mother harvested potatoes. His father died in 1827 and Meves was taken care of by his maternal grandfather pastor L\u00fcders in Braunschweig. At fifteen he went to study pharmacy at Elbengerode am Harz and graduated after a five-year apprenticeship. He continued to study and also observe birds in the field. He went to the University of Kiel in 1840 where he was employed as an amanuens by Friedrich Boie. He then left his pharmacy studies and improved his skills in the preparation of skins and in taxidermic mounts. When Carl Jacob Sundevall visited Kiel in 1841 he offered Meves a position at the Riksmuseum in Stockholm. Meves moved to Sweden in 1842 and worked there until his retirement in 1877. As part of the museum work, he collected extensively across Europe and Russia and published extensively on his findings. He took a special interest in the immature stages of birds and their plumages. He was a founding member of the Stockholm Entomological Society in 1879. Among his major works was a manual of taxidermy that he published in 1882. The African starling Lamprotornis mevesii was named in his honour.\nMeves was able to demonstrate using chemical analysis that the reddish coloration of adult lammergeiers and of their outside of the eggs was caused by iron oxide. Meves was also the first to identify the source of the drumming sounds of snipe as the tail feathers. He had observed it first in the field in 1856 but he attached the outer tail feather with a fine thread to a steel wire and attached it to a stick and was able to move it rapidly through the air to recreate the bleating sound.\nMeves married Ida Lappe, daughter of Karl Lappe, in 1844 and became a Swedish citizen in 1865. Ida was an active translator of poetry. She died a year before him. He bequeathed his personal collections of birds eggs and butterflies to the Swedish museum. He had no children of his own but adopted a nephew Julius Seelhorst-Meves (1844\u20131926) who became an entomologist.\n",

    "Former lifeboat station in Northumberland, England\nHauxley Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the village of Low Hauxley in the county of Northumberland. A lifeboat was first stationed here in 1852.\nHauxley lifeboat station was closed, when a motor-powered lifeboat was placed at Amble in 1939.\nHistory\nA lifeboat was placed at Hauxley in 1852, managed by the Newcastle Shipwreck Association (NSA), initially to co-exist with the existing NSA station at Amble, only a couple of miles further north. But there was some belief that Hauxley was better suited as a location for a lifeboat, and this was borne out, with Amble being closed in 1856.\nA site at Hauxley was provided by Capt. S. F. Widdrington, RN. A boathouse was constructed, and a 34-foot self-righting lifeboat, costing \u00a3200, was commissioned with Teasdel of Great Yarmouth, all funded by local dignitary, Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland. The boat arrived at Hauxley on the 8 September 1852, and was named Warkworth. In 1853, the station became part of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), which would become the RNLI in 1854.\nWarkworth would serve for three years at Hauxley, launching on service only 4 times, but saving 20 lives. Remarkably, all 4 launches were within a 5-day period. In a storm of 6 January 1854, Warkworth was launched to the aid of the Monarch of Guernsey, rescuing all 10 crew. Later the same day, a second launch saved 6 from the Earl of Newburgh, of South Shields.The storm raged on, and on 9 January, the lifeboat saved the crew of 4 from the Heroine of Burnham. Sadly, the lifeboat launched on its fourth service on the 10 January 1854 to the Catherine Maria of Odense in Denmark, but the ship broke up, and all lives were lost.Awards were made, see Station honours.\nHauxley would receive a replacement lifeboat in 1855, a 30-foot unnamed Peake-class lifeboat, built by Forrestt of Limehouse and costing \u00a3155, once again funded by the Duke of Northumberland. She was transported from London on the steam ship Pioneer to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, from where she was towed north, arriving in Hauxley on 7 August 1855. On 4 January 1857, she would be launched twice, firstly being taken 3 miles down the coast, and launched to the aid of the Sophie of Oporto, rescuing the crew of 11. The lifeboat would then go the aid of the Georgina of Inverness, rescuing a further 5 men. For these services, Capt. Hipplewhite received the RNLI Silver Medal\nIn 1865, Hauxley would receive their third lifeboat. A 34-foot Self-righting (P&S)  boat constructed by Forrestt at a cost of \u00a3295, she arrived in Hauxley in 1866 after being conveyed by the Great Northern and North Eastern Railway companies free of charge. Modification were carried out to the boathouse, and a new carriage was required, costing \u00a3163 in total. The recently deceased Duke of Northumberland had been president of both the RNIPLS and the RNLI, and all costs were met by his wife, Eleanor Percy, Duchess of Northumberland, in memory of her late husband, the boat being named Algernon and Eleanor.\nA further two lifeboat would be supplied to Hauxley. In 1887, a 37-foot 12-oar  Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, costing built by D & W Henderson of Partick, Glasgow, and again named Algernon and Eleanor (ON 195). Then in 1902, a 34-foot 10-oar Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, constructed by Thames Ironworks at \u00a3598. Provided by a legacy from Miss M Andrew, of Hale, Cheshire, the boat was named Mary Andrew (ON 483). Two coxswains would be awarded the RNLI Silver Medal for their long service, James Armstrong in 1885, and later Andrew Oliver in 1899.\nThe Hauxley lifeboats were launched a total of 81 times, and save 246 lives. It was only when the RNLI decided to reopen the station at Amble with a motor powered 45ft Watson-class lifeboat, the Frederick and Emma (ON 659), that Mary Andrew was withdrawn from service, and the Hauxley station was closed in 1939. The lifeboat house still exists, and today is a private residence.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Hauxley\nRNLI Silver Medal\nMiddleton Henry Dand, Land Owner - 1849\nMiddleton Henry Dand, Land Owner - 1854 (Second-Service Clasp)\nCapt.

    "British professor\nWainwright in Stockholm in 2024\nJean Barbara Wainwright  (born in June 1954) is a British professor and curator in London. As an art historian and critic she has specialized and exhibited her expertise regarding Andy Warhol's life and work. Her method  features interviews with artists, photographers, filmmakers and curators known internationally. Wainwright \u2019s archives contain over 1,000 interviews of which many have been published in numerous catalogues and books. She had contributed such work to the Tate Gallery's archives with over 170 interviews also available on the Internet. With special interest in art-world connectivity, her many interviews done for Audio Arts have created a twenty-year profile of art at large. Knowledge of the art world has expanded considerably, academically, through her archive beginning in the 1960s, since then developing into her roles in teaching, supervision and as a consultant.\nWainwright has published considerably and contributed to many catalogues and books.  She also regularly appears on television and radio, most notably on Channel 4, the BBC, Open University, Resonance FM and BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The lists of her artist interviews and titles are extensive.\nWainwright's doctorate was on Warhol's audio tapes. She has become a senior lecturer at UCA Rochester and as an art critic often works with Art Newspaper TV. While she did exhibitions with Tracey Emin, the frequency  of Warhol mentions awakened Wainwright's interest in Warhol's films, looking at their relationship to young British artists. In New York and Pittsburgh she got involved with the family and a grant came through for her for work on a PhD involving sound, so she zeroed in on Warrhol's tapes. Her job is to lead a department of cultural studies and clear the way for students to contextualise their work in photography. She is very fond of teaching and speaking and closeness to creative processes.\nJean Wainwright is Director of the Fine Art and the Photography Research Centre at UCA. She has focused on photography and the emergence of new themes and processes, including contemporary and political work by Dagmar van Weeghel, Bettina von Zwehl, Emily Allchurch, Julia Fullerton-Batten and contrasting Karine Laval as well as Michele Cirillo.\nWainwright's Audio Arts Archive begun in 1996 continues to grow and she went online at the Tate in 2014.  Her international exhibitions include My Search for Andy Warhol\u2019s Voice 2011\u20132012, Ship to Shore: Art and the Lure of the Sea 2014, Gestures of Resistance 2017, Powerful Tides, 400 Years of Chatham and the Sea 2018, Another Spring 2018 and Documents from the Edges of Conflict 2021\u20132022.

    "Tram by Konstal in Poland\nKonstal 114Na (after modernization 114Na \u2013 MF 12) is an articulated low-floor tram, manufactured in 1997 by Konstal works in Chorz\u00f3w, in a quantity of 2 units for the Gda\u0144sk Municipal Transport Company. It is the second low-floor tram type produced in Poland after the 112N. A significant part of the solutions was taken from the previously produced single unit of the 112N type.\nHistory\nOrigins\nKonstal 112N\nIn the late 1960s, the production of the first Polish modern trams, Konstal 13N, was completed, and work was underway on further tram models. Among many projects, only Konstal 102N and its modified version, Konstal 102Na, were successfully implemented. However, the production of these trams did not meet the current needs, so in 1973, the prototype of the Konstal 105N tram was developed. The model was put into production in 1974 and was well received by transportation authorities due to its modern design. Despite this, significant changes were introduced to the design after just 5 years, resulting in the most popular model in the Konstal 105Na family. Vehicles of this generation were still being produced in the 1990s, although they were considered outdated and underwent various modernizations.\nIn September 1992, a GT6N tram from Bremen was tested in Warsaw; however, the city authorities did not purchase any new low-floor trams. In 1995, Konstal produced its first tram with a low-floor section, the two-section model 112N, which was sold to Warsaw.\nDuring this time, trams in Gda\u0144sk were in poor condition, both in terms of rolling stock and infrastructure. The Gda\u0144sk authorities began to modernize their public transportation fleet. The new tram utilized many elements from its predecessor, including the entire front section and the end section of the rear part, effectively being a three-section version of the 112N.\nProduction\nIn 1997, two trams of a new type were produced, which were structurally developed from the 112N tram. The 114Na tram is distinguished primarily from its predecessor by the additional middle section, which houses a low floor. The prototype entered the tracks in Gda\u0144sk on 20 March 1997, while the second one on 18 April 1997. Thanks to this design, Gda\u0144sk became the second city in Poland to have a partially low-floor tram and the first to have more than one such type.\nProduction ceased after the introduction of the low-floor trams Konstal 116N and Konstal NGd99 into the market.\nConstruction\nBody\nInterior before modernization\nInterior after modernization\nThe 114Na is a three-section, unidirectional, single-sided tram with 13% low floor accessibility. Compared to its predecessor, an additional section was added, and the low-floor section was placed in the middle compartment. This allows wheelchair users (with the assistance of another person) and strollers to enter. Despite similarities, the body structure was made using a different technology than the Konstal 105Na model. The body is made of closed profiles and represents a structural development of the Konstal 112N tram. The connection between the sections is made using double articulation, previously unused in Poland, allowing for quick uncoupling and coupling of the mechanical and electrical parts.\nThe floor is made of plywood-rubber panels and covered with anti-slip flooring. The flooring is smooth and folded onto the walls to facilitate interior cleaning. The tram is equipped with five doors, each 1,300\u00a0mm wide, folding outwards, secured with a triple system to prevent passengers from being caught (sensitive edges, phototube, overload switch). The doors can be opened centrally by the driver and by passengers using buttons.\nInterior\nThe tram features exclusively single seats, mostly facing forward. The seats were specially designed for this vehicle and were among the most modern seats used worldwide at the time of production. They are vandal-resistant yet covered with elegant fabric. One of the tram's advantages is its large capacity, able to accommodate a total of 285 passengers. This is more than two times the capacity of the 105Na and slightly less than three times the capacity of the 105Na.\nThe tram is equipped with forced air heating. There are no ventilation or air conditioning devices inside the carriage; only natural ventilation is possible through tilting windows and roof hatches.\nThe 114Na is equipped with fluorescent lights illuminating the interior of the body as well as additional lights illuminating the doors.\nPropulsion system\nA thyristor-based traction control system is employed, capable of energy recuperation during braking. The entire system is mounted on four traction bogies.\nThe tram is equipped with a control panel allowing for maneuvering at a speed of 10\u00a0km/h.\nExploitation\nKonstal 114Na before modernization on Siedlce line\nKonstal 114Na after modernization on Strzy\u017ca line\n21/22 March 1997 marked the delivery of the first tram to Gda\u0144sk, followed by the second in April.

    "Lithuanian military officer\nPortrait of Jonas \u017dilinskas\nJonas \u017dilinskas (1888\u20131956) was a military officer and the first head of the interwar Lithuanian intelligence service, the Unit of Intelligence (\u017dvalgybos skyrius).\nBiography\nJonas \u017dilinskas was born in 1888 in the village of Smalininkai in Congress Poland. \u017dilinskas was a law student in the Saint Petersburg State University and an officer in the Russian Imperial Army. He became famous for organizing a small Lithuanian volunteer force around the area of Kalvarija. In 1918, then-Colonel Jurgis Kubilius\u00a0 received notice about \u017dilinskas. \u017dilinskas was called to Vilnius and ordered to \"be a permanent, now paid official of the Supreme Military Council\". The assignment date of \u017dilinskas, 27 October 1918, is considered the start of Lithuanian military intelligence activities. On 1 December 1918 \u017dilinskas officially joined the Lithuanian army. According to \u017dilinskas's memoirs, Liudas Gira, a local of Vilnius, advised \u017dilinskas on what individuals to trust in the new endeavor. \u017dilinskas and his team would send information to Prime Minister Augustinas Voldemaras. To cover the true nature of his work, \u017dilinskas was officially named a \"special affairs officer\". On 6 January 1919, the News unit (\u017dini\u0173 dalis) was established in Kaunas, which would later divulge into an organized intelligence agency. In the beginning, a total of four agents worked in the agency. On 12 May 1919, the News unit was re-established as the Unit of Intelligence. However, \u017dilinskas at that time was ill, and so had to be often substituted by Mikalojus Lip\u010dius, who would become \u017dilinskas's official successor on 12 July 1919. After his service in military intelligence, \u017dilinskas was made the chief censor. He also served in the 7th Infantry Regiment. After being demobilized in 1922, \u017dilinskas worked at the Bank of Lithuania. After the 1926 Lithuanian coup d'\u00e9tat, \u017dilinskas was made chief of the railway police. From 17 October 1929 he worked in Kaunas as a notary.\nIn 1944 \u017dilinskas moved to Germany, and later to the United States. \u017dilinskas died in 1956.\n",
    "\nEdwin Sydney Jackson (17 May 1922 \u2013 10 April 2016) was a Canadian actuary who served as president and chairman of Manulife. Jackson joined the Manufacturers' Life Insurance Company in 1948 in Toronto, and during the 1950s and 1960s rose through the company's ranks. In 1970 he was elected a director, and in 1972 was appointed president. After the death of Manulife's chairman in 1978, he became acting chairman of the board. In 1985, Jackson stepped down from the presidency and was elected chairman. He served in that role until 1990, through he stayed on as a director. After the abrupt resignation of chairman Thomas di Giacomo in August 1993, Jackson served as the interim chairman until March 1994. That year, aged 72, Jackson retired from Manulife.\nBiography\nEdwin Sydney Jackson was born on 17 May 1922 in Regina to Edwin Jackson (1882\u201319??) and Dorothy Hazel Bell (1892\u20131974). In 1940 he graduated from Regina Central Collegiate. From 1943 to 1945, Jackson served as an officer in the Canadian Army.\nAfter the war, Jackson enrolled at the University of Manitoba, and in 1947 graduated Bachelor of Commerce. Following graduation, he taught actuarial studies for a year. In 1948, he moved to Toronto where he joined the actuarial department of the Manufacturers' Life Insurance Company. In 1952 he became an assistant actuary, in 1956 an actuary, and in 1964 an actuarial vice-president. In 1969 he was appointed a senior vice-president, and in 1970 became an executive vice-president and was elected to the board of directors. For the 1966\u201367 year, he served as president of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries.\nOn 1 January 1972, Jackson succeeded Alfred Thomas Seedhouse as president of the company. At this time, Seedhouse was elected chairman of the board. When Seedhouse died on 12 February 1978, Jackson became the acting chairman.\nIn August 1985, Jackson stepped down from the presidency and was elected chairman of the board and chief executive officer. The presidency was assumed by Thomas Anthony di Giacomo, who gained the chief operating officer title also. In January 1987, Jackson ceded the chief executive role to Giacomo. Effective 1 May 1990, Jackson stepped down from the chair, and Giacomo was elected chairman in addition to president and chief executive. On 19 August 1993, Giacomo resigned from the company, leaving the offices of president, chairman, and chief executive vacant. Giacomo's resignation came after a falling out with the board that had begun in November 1991. Upon Giacomo's departure, William R. C. Blundell was appointed interim president, while Jackson became interim chairman. In early 1994, Manulife recruited Dominic D'Alessandro, then president of the Laurentian Bank of Canada, as its next president, while Blundell was elected chairman of the board. After Blundell's election, Jackson announced his retirement from the company.\nOn 19 May 1948, Jackson married Nancy Joyce Stovel (1927\u20131998) of Winnipeg. The Jacksons had three daughters: Patricia, Barbara, and Catherine. Sydney Jackson was a member of the Granite Club, Toronto Club, and United Church of Canada. He died at his home in Toronto on 10 April 2016, a month short of his 94th birthday.\n",

    "Historic building in Par\u00e1, Brazil\nThe S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s Market (Portuguese: Mercado de S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s) is a historic building located in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m, in the state of Par\u00e1. It was built during the Amazon rubber cycle. Construction began on May 1, 1910, and was completed on May 21, 1911.\nThe market was built to accommodate the large amount of trade generated by the Bel\u00e9m-Bragan\u00e7a Railway, whose last stop was in the S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s neighborhood. It was also designed to expand the city's supply, which until then had been concentrated in the Ver-o-Peso Market. The structure is made from iron and mixes art nouveau and neoclassical elements, with sculptural details also in iron and decorative tiles.\nHistory\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Ant\u00f4nio Lemos, the mayor of Bel\u00e9m, granted the land to build the market. Materials and workers were imported from Italy, and the work was executed by the Italian engineer Filinto Santoro, who was also responsible for the Augusto Montenegro Palace and the Gentil Bittencourt School.\nIn 1988, during the administration of Mayor Fernando Coutinho Jorge, the market underwent a major renovation with significant changes to spatial aspects and use. After the intervention, the current building included spaces for theater, marketing and municipal administration workshops. Due to the acoustics and the amount of traffic, the theater was shut down and the market temporarily closed. The fish market, flanked by kiosks of the same style, form the cultural complex of the S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s Market.\nThe second renovation took place between 1998 and 1999 under Mayor Edmilson Rodrigues and included the restoration of the roof, waterproofing and painting. At the time, due to the increase in informal work in the area, street vendors were relocated to the market.\nPreservation\nThe S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s Market is managed by Bel\u00e9m City Hall through the Municipal Secretariat for the Economy (Secon). The S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s Market Architectural and Landscape Complex was listed as a historical heritage site by the Par\u00e1 State Heritage Department on July 2, 1982. The building is currently suffering from poor maintenance by the public authorities. There are evident signs of deterioration in the space, with problems such as leaks in the walls and an accumulation of garbage. Despite the intense flow of people, the area around the building lacks security, which has led to frequent assaults and thefts in Floriano Peixoto Square, located near the market. The poor state of repair of the square also directly affects the market, as it is used as a shelter by homeless people.\nStructure and services\nToday, the S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s Complex is composed of areas including a market, a fish and meat market, handicrafts, a grocery store and a food court. The structure comprises three pavilions with vaulted brick roofs and white marble decoration. It is located close to Almirante Barroso, Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio and Magalh\u00e3es Barata avenues.\nSee also\nHistory of Bel\u00e9m\nCulture and tourism in Bel\u00e9m\n",
    "Medieval stronghold\nMonyak (Bulgarian: \u041c\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043a) is a 12th-century medieval fortress in the Rhodope Mountains of southern Bulgaria, mentioned in the chronicles of the Fourth Crusade as Chastel de Moniac in Old French. It had a strategic role protecting the Zhelezna Vrata Pass.\nLocation and description\nA view from Monyak towards Kardzhali\nMonyak is identified with the fortress ruins on a 587\u00a0m height rising on the left bank of the river Arda over the modern Studen Kladenets Reservoir. It lies in Kardzhali Province some 4\u00a0km south of the village of Shiroko pole and 12\u00a0km east from the town of Kardzhali. From Monyak there is an excellent visibility towards the Vishegrad Fortress (306\u00a0m) on the right bank of the Arda some 4.5\u00a0km to the west, as well as to the fortress of the medieval Monastery of John the Precursor 7.5\u00a0km to the west. Monyak and Vishegrad were likely constructed to the protect the region around the mouth of the river Varbitsa and the roads along its course.\nMonyak consisted of a citadel in the eastern highest section and an outer ring. It is difficult to access due to the steep escarpments of the hill. Its remains include parts of the defensive walls, an octagonal tower and water reservoirs dated from the 12th century, probably during and/or before the Third Crusade, built on the foundations of a significantly older Roman castrum. The preserved part of the outer fortress wall along the northern side of the hill is more than 270\u00a0m long, and its height in places reaches 7\u20138\u00a0m. It is built of stones welded with lime and sand. The remains of the tower is reach about 3\u20134\u00a0m in height. The entrance is from the west and was protected by two towers. The total area of the fortification is 18,000\u00a0m2, including the citadel that encompassed around 600\u00a0m2.\nDuring the construction of the fortress, serious attention was paid to the reservoirs. There are two above-ground water tanks. All this is evident of its function as protected habitation for a large number of people and the possibility to shelter an army.\nHistory\nRuins of the walls\nThe fortress was mentioned in the chronicles of the Third and Fourth Crusades of the late 12th and early 13th century as Manicaua or Moniac. The eyewitness account on the Forth Crusade On the Conquest of Constantinople by Geoffrey of Villehardouin mentioned the fortress on two occasions in the context of the 1206 campaigns of the Bulgarian\u2013Latin wars between the Bulgarian emperor Kaloyan and the Latin Empire:\n\"Then did Henry, the Regent of the empire, take council with the barons that were with him; and they decided to ride forward. So they rode forward for two days, and encamped in a very fair valley, near a castle called Moniac. The castle yielded itself to them, and they remained there five days; and then said they would go and relieve Renier of Trit, who was besieged in Stanimac, and had been shut up therein for thirteen months. So Henry the Regent of the empire, remained in the camp, with a great part of the host, and the remainder went forward to relieve Renier of Trit at Stanimac.\"\nIt was at Monyak that Henry of Flanders was informed in late July 1206 of the death of the Latin emperor Baldwin I in Bulgarian captivity, who had been captured in the battle of Adrianople in the previous year, and headed to Constantinople for his own coronation:\n\"Then said the barons that they had often heard tell that the Emperor Baldwin had died in Johannizza's  prison, but that they did not believe it. Renier of Trit, however, told them of a truth that the emperor was dead, and then they believed it. Greatly did many then grieve; alas if only their grief had not been beyond remedy. So they lay that night in the city; and on the morrow they departed, and abandoned Stanimac. They rode for two days, and on the third they came to the camp, below the castle of Moniac, that lies on the river Arta, where Henry, the Emperor's brother, was waiting for them. Greatly did those of the host rejoice over Renier of Trit, who had thus been rescued from durance, and great was the credit given to those who had brought him back, for they had gone for him in great peril. The barons now resolved that they would go to Constantinople, and crown Henry, the brother of the Emperor Baldwin as emperor...\"\nGallery\nRuins of the walls\nRuins of Monyak\nView of the hill\nView towards the right bank of the Arda\nCitations\n^ a b c d \"The Monyak Fortress near the town of Kardzhali\".

It features the character of Paul D\u00e9dalus, who is considered Desplechin's alter-ego and who first appeared in his film My Sex Life... or How I Got into an Argument (1996) and its prequel My Golden Days (2015). In Filmlovers!, he returns to the character's childhood, and tells the story of how he got introduced to cinema: first as a spectator, then as a cinephile, and finally a filmmaker. The film is a hybrid of documentary and fiction that incorporates archival footage of film clips and stills as well as interviews with those who accompanied Desplechin in his experiences as a spectator. Ranging from Hollywood blockbusters to Italian neorealism, from the silent era to the cutting edge of contemporary cinema, the film is a journey through the images that shaped the filmmaking eye of Arnaud Desplechin. Desplechin wrote the film's screenplay, in collaboration with Fanny Burdino. The film was produced by Charles Gillibert at CG Cin\u00e9ma. It is co-produced by Scala Films, Arte France Cin\u00e9ma and Hill Valley, with the participation of French fashion house Chanel.\nPrincipal photography began on 17 July 2023 in Avion, Pas-de-Calais, where shooting took place for two days at the cinema Le Familia, which was transformed to resemble the 1960s and 1970s. Filming continued that same week in Roubaix and Tourcoing. Desplechin planned to shoot sequences in his former high school, in which a multimedia room bears his name. Filming then moved to Paris.\nRelease\nThe film was selected to be screened in the Special Screenings section at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, where it will have its world premiere on 22 May 2024.\nInternational sales are handled by Les Films du losange, who will also distribute the film in France.\nAccolades\n",

    "German-built passenger liner\nSS Nyassa was a steam ocean liner that was launched in Germany in 1906 as B\u00fclow for Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL). In 1916 Portugal seized her, renamed her Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes, and placed her under the management of Transportes Mar\u00edtimos do Estado (TME). In 1924 Companhia Nacional de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o (CNN) bought her and renamed her Nyassa. After a long career with CNN she was scrapped in England in 1951.\nAs B\u00fclow, the ship sailed mostly between Bremen and the Far East. However, she spent 1907 making three return voyages between Bremen and Sydney, and in 1908 she made at least three return voyages between Bremen and New York.\nAs Nyassa, her scheduled route was between Lisbon and Mo\u00e7ambique via Cape Town. In 1941 she rescued survivors from a British merchant ship that had been sunk by a U-boat. From 1940 to 1944 she made numerous voyages taking refugees from Portugal, Spain, and Morocco to the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Palestine.\n\"General\"-class liners\nBetween 1903 and 1908 NDL took delivery of a class of 11 twin-screw passenger liners, of intermediate size and speed, from four different German shipbuilders. All were named after Prussian field marshals and generals of the 18th and early 19th century, so they were called the Feldherren-Klasse, or in English the \"General\" class. Schichau-Werke in Danzig (now Gda\u0144sk in Poland) built five of the class, including the lead ship, Zieten, which was launched in 1902 and completed in 1903. Joh. C. Tecklenborg in Bremerhaven built three: Roon in 1903, Scharnhorst in 1904, and B\u00fclow in 1906. AG Weser in Bremen built two, and AG Vulcan in Stettin (now Szczecin in Poland) built one.\nBuilding\nFreiherr von B\u00fclow\nTecklenborg built the ship as yard number 209. She was launched on 21 April 1906 as B\u00fclow, after Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow (1755\u20131816), a Prussian Army general who served in the Napoleonic Wars. She was completed and made her sea trials on 22 September.\nHer registered length was 462.4\u00a0ft (140.9\u00a0m), her beam was 57.6\u00a0ft (17.6\u00a0m), and her depth was 36.0\u00a0ft (11.0\u00a0m). Her hull had a double bottom and nine watertight bulkheads. The watertight doors in the bulkheads could be closed hydraulically by remote control from her bridge, and she was designed to remain afloat with any two of her compartments flooded.\nShe had berths for 2,044 passengers: 108 in first class; 106 in second class; and 1,830 in steerage. Her amenities included a passenger gymnasium with electric exercise machines. Some of her cargo holds were refrigerated. Her tonnages were 8,965\u00a0GRT and 5,034\u00a0NRT.\nEach of her screws was driven by a quadruple-expansion engine. The combined power of her twin engines was rated at 760 NHP or 6,500 ihp. On her sea trials she averaged 5,980 ihp, and maintained 16 knots (30\u00a0km/h). Her normal cruising speed in service was 15 knots (28\u00a0km/h).\nB\u00fclow\nA postcard of the ship as B\u00fclow\nNDL registered B\u00fclow in Bremen. Her code letters were QJFB. On 26 September 1906 she left Bremen on her maiden voyage, which was on NDL's route to the Far East via the Suez Canal.\nAfter her maiden voyage, B\u00fclow made three trips to Australia. On the first she left Bremen on 23 January 1907, carrying passengers including a German grand opera company recruited by the theatre producer George Musgrove. She called at Antwerp, Southampton, Genoa, Naples, and Port Said; passed through the Suez Canal; and called at Aden and Colombo. On 4\u20135 March she called at Fremantle; on 9 March she arrived off Adelaide; and on 12\u201313 March she called at Melbourne. On 16 March she reached NDL's wharf at West Circular Quay in Sydney. With B\u00fclow and other ships of similar speed, NDL planned to reduce the journey time between Bremen and Sydney by five days. On her return voyage, B\u00fclow left Sydney on 23 March, called at Melbourne on 25 March, Adelaide on 28 March, and Fremantle on 2 April, and reached Bremen on 8 May.\nOn her next voyage to Australia, B\u00fclow reached Sydney on 3 July with passengers including 112 agricultural labourers for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, who were to change ships in Sydney and continue to Queensland. 104 of them were from Catalonia in Spain. The other eight were from Lincolnshire in England, where they had been earning nine shillings a week. Their contract with the sugar company increased their wage to 22 shillings and sixpence.\nOn her final voyage to Australia, B\u00fclow reached Sydney on 23 October. Her passengers included four German scientists on their way to research in New Guinea. At Circular Quay they transferred to the NDL ship Prinz Sigismund to complete their journey. For her return voyage, B\u00fclow loaded 6,900 bales of wool. She left Sydney on 2 November.\nIn 1908 NDL B\u00fclow made at least three round trips on NDL's main North Atlantic route. She left Bremen on 11 January, on 23 January she arrived off New York, and on 28 January she left New York to return to Bremen. She made another transatlantic crossing that summer. ",
    "2020 book by Natalia Telepneva\nCold War Liberation: The Soviet Union and the Collapse of the Portuguese Empire in Africa, 1961\u20131975 is a book by Natalia Telepneva. It was published by the University of North Carolina Press in 2022. The book explores the Soviet Union's involvement in African anti-colonial movements, specifically in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau. Drawing upon newly available archival sources and interviews with key figures, Telepneva sheds light on the intricate relationships between African liberation leaders and Soviet bureaucrats, highlighting the agency of the former in enlisting Soviet support. Through a reinterpretation of historical events, the book contributes to discussions surrounding Cold War policy-making in the Global South, offering insights into the dynamics of superpower rivalry in sub-Saharan Africa during the mid-20th century.\nBackground\nOn 2 May 2023, The History and Public Policy Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars hosted a seminar dedicated to discussing the book. Telepneva as well as two panelist, Eric Arnesen and Christian Ostermann, discussed the book for about ninety minutes. Discussing her book during the panel, Telepneva said that \"much of the book is devoted to explaining how these African revolutionaries navigated both local politics and internal rivalries\" all while keeping and cultivating stronger ties with major international donors like the Soviet Union.\nThe book was published in January 2022 online with the support of the Andrew Mellon Foundation and in hardback by University of North Carolina Press in the 'New Histories of the Cold War\" series in June 2022. It is available in open access.\nThe book launch took place on the 25 April 2022 in a conversation with Arne Westad and David Anderson.\nSynopsis\nThe book examines Soviet engagement with African revolutionary movements within the context of the Global Cold War, highlighting the role of ideology and personal relationships in Soviet foreign policy. Telepneva draws from newly declassified Soviet archives and oral history to argue that ideological motivations, alongside pragmatic considerations, drove Soviet interactions in Portuguese Africa. The book explores the involvement of Soviet officials, emphasizing the significance of personal connections with African leaders in shaping policy decisions. The book also reconstructs the dynamics of Soviet involvement in the Angolan Civil War in 1974\u201375.\nCritical reception\nDmitry Asinovskiy thought that Telepneva's narrative emphasized personal relationships and ideological affinities in shaping Soviet policies towards African revolutionaries, yet overlooked the bureaucratic processes within the Soviet system. Asinovskiy judged the book as \"an essential contribution to the historiography of Soviet attempts to engage with the decolonising world.\"\nErin Kimball Damman explained how in her book, Telepneva demonstrated the cautious approach of the Soviet Union post-Carnation Revolution and sheds light on its cooperation with Cuba in arming the MPLA in Angola. Damman thought that despite a complex narrative involving multiple political actors, the book provides valuable insights into Cold War dynamics and Soviet strategies in Africa.\nAlexander Hill praised the book for its significant contribution to studying the Soviet support for national liberation movements during the Cold War, particularly focusing on the collapse of the Portuguese Empire in Africa. Hill highlighted Telepneva's emphasis on \"African agency\" in interactions with the Soviet Union, showcasing the complexity of relationships beyond traditional diplomatic narratives.\nBenedito Machava highlighted how the book reveals the pivotal role of African leaders in securing support for decolonization, emphasizing their agency in navigating global power dynamics. Machave thought that while the book is predominantly focused on male figures, it offers valuable insights into the complex diplomatic maneuvers that shaped the decolonization process in Lusophone Africa.\nIn his review, Maxim Matusevich paised the book's exploration of Soviet involvement in Africa during the Cold War. Matusevich highlighted Telepneva's emphasis on personal encounters and connections within the larger geopolitical context, shedding light on the complexities of Soviet foreign policy and the challenges of understanding African agency. The review underscored Telepneva's examination of the role of individuals, including the \"Cominternians\" and the \"War Generation,\" in shaping Soviet-African relations.\nMatt Mulhern highlighted the book's focus on the pivotal role of Soviet bureaucrats known as \"mezhdunarodniki\" in implementing Soviet policy towards Africa during the Cold War. Telepneva's extensive research sheds light on Soviet assistance to African liberation movements, particularly in Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique, challenging previous narratives that downplayed Soviet involvement after Khrushchev's ouster.

    "French cyclist\nAchille Germain was a French road and track cyclist.\nA professional from 1905 to 1919, he won many local events but also shone on the velodromes of Paris, where he gained a great reputation in middle-distance races, notably taking third place in the French championship in 1914. Second in the Six Days of Toulouse in 1906, in partnership with Jean Gauban, he also participated twice in the Six Days of New York and took part in the first Six Days of Paris in 1913.\nGermain, nicknamed \u201cGermain de la Fl\u00e8che\u201d by his followers, also competed in road races, taking part in the 1908 Tour de France, where he placed 16th, achieving his best result with an eighth-place finish on the tenth stage to Bordeaux. \nThe following year, he won a stage in the Circuit de la Loire and finished second overall.\nMobilized as a corporal cyclist with the 317th Infantry regiment during the First World War, he retired from the sport in 1919 following an injury sustained during the conflict. He retired to La Fl\u00e8che to run a cycle repair shop and became so involved in local life that he was elected town councilor in his final years.\nBiography\nEarly cycling career\nAchille Germain was born in Beaupr\u00e9au, Maine-et-Loire, on May 5, 1884, but his family moved to La Fl\u00e8che, Sarthe, when he was still very young. His beginnings in cycling were fairly modest. He took part in his first races in his adopted town in 1902, at the July 14th races held on the Promenade du Pr\u00e9. He came second in the bonus race.\nThe following year, he joined the newly-formed Union v\u00e9locip\u00e9dique fl\u00e9choise (UVF), and at the same July 14 meeting, came second in the speed final and third in the bonus race. On September 20, he finished second in the 100-kilometer UVF Cup behind Mareau from Mance, a member of the Union Auto-Cycliste de la Sarthe.\nThe Buffalo velodrome at the end of the 19th century.\nLike many racers of the time, Germain took part in both road and track events. On April 4, 1904, at the opening of the Fl\u00e9chois velodrome on rue Belleborde, he scored his first victory in the middle-distance race, which he won by half a lap over his rivals. The same day, he reached the final of the sprint race, where he was narrowly beaten by Tubi\u00e8res from Mance. He went on to achieve good results on the Fl\u00e9choise track, finishing third in the Sarthe departmental championship and then in the La Fl\u00e8che championship in June, and fourth in the regional final the following month, an event won by Nantes rider Hardy.\nOn July 31, Germain scored a prestigious success on the track of the Buffalo Velodrome in Neuilly, clearly dominating the 10-kilometer bonus race. During the event, he won the last five of the ten intermediate sprints, pocketing a ten-franc bonus each time. Back in La Fl\u00e8che in September, he took second place in the UVF speed championship behind clubmate Albert Leroy, who had just taken part in the Tour de France.\nProfessional racer\nA benchmark in track racing (1905\u20131907)\nIn 1905, Germain, then a third category professional racer, established himself as one of the best cyclists in his region. On the Fl\u00e9chois velodrome on March 26, he won the speed event, the 45-lap race behind the bike, and the bonus race, a domination he repeated on April 24, when he won the Sarthe departmental speed championship, held on the same track, as well as the 25 km race and the bonus race. At the end of the summer, he scored two further successes, with the Grand Prix de Tours on September 9 and the Grand Prix de Montlu\u00e7on the following day, both in the middle-distance race. He also distinguished himself in more modest competitions, such as the 4-kilometer cantonal race he won in Verron in early October 5, or at folklore events: the Pinder Circus was visiting La Fl\u00e8che, and Germain competed with several Fl\u00e9chois amateurs on the \u201cCanadian track\u201d, a 6.5-meter-diameter construction of wooden rungs spaced ten centimeters apart and inclined at 75 degrees. After an unsuccessful first attempt, he achieved the best performance of the participants, completing eight laps of the track.\nDuring the winter of 1905\u20131906, Germain trained alongside the best specialists of the day on the V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver track in Paris. Though he could see the gap existing between him and those in the lead, Germain's persistence in training was noticed. Along with Georges Parent, he was chosen to join the coaching team of Henri Cornet, winner of the 1904 Tour de France, in a 50-kilometer tandem match against Karl Ingold. Cornet won by nine laps. At the same meeting, Germain made his mark as an individual in the 15-kilometer race behind motorcycles. Third behind Paul Rug\u00e8re and Anton Jaeck, his offensive behavior throughout the race was praised by the spectators. On February 18, he teamed up with Denmark's Axel Hansen in the American-style Twelve Hours race, in which the two competitors took turns at will. At the end of the race, fourteen teams were still classified in the same lap: victory was therefore decided over six la",
    "Food recall\nIn late 2008 and early 2009, nine people died and at least 714 people fell ill due to food poisoning from eating products containing contaminated peanuts supplied by the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA). The real numbers were believed to be much higher, since for every reported case of salmonellosis, on average, another 38 or so cases go unreported, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A combination of epidemiological analysis and laboratory testing by state officials in Minnesota and Connecticut, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC confirmed that the sources of the outbreak of illnesses caused by Salmonella typhimurium were peanut butter, peanut paste, and peanut meal produced by the PCA at its Blakely, Georgia, processing plant.\nOn February 7, 2009, Oregon officials confirmed the first case of salmonellosis in a dog that had eaten biscuits contaminated with the PCA-produced peanut products.\nIn January 2009, the company issued a statement categorically denying the allegations; in January 2009, it shut down production and laid off 50 employees at the Blakely plant.\nBackground\nAflatoxin suits\nPCA was sued in 1990 by the American Candy Company after the FDA discovered that PCA's peanut butter exceeded the FDA tolerance level for aflatoxin, a mold-derived toxin common to peanut production; American Candy had turned the peanut butter into 8,000 unshipped cases of \"kisses\" for Wal-Mart. Another lawsuit was brought by Zachary Confections Inc. of Frankfort, Indiana, in 1991, after a 40,020-pound shipment of nuts from PCA was also found to have an unacceptably high level of aflatoxin.\nNestl\u00e9 inspection\nIn January 2006, Nestl\u00e9 completed an onsite audit of PCA's Plainview plant, and gave it a \"Does Not Meet Standards\" score on nearly all 40 inspection areas. Months after, PCA hired Kenneth Kendrick as assistant plant manager at the Plainview plant.\nFDA oversight before 2008\nIn 2001, FDA inspectors also found that products from the Blakely plant were potentially exposed to insecticides, according to a report obtained by the Associated Press.\nAccording to Virginia state inspection records, the PCA blanching operations in Suffolk, Virginia, had some of the same food safety problems that would be found in the company's Georgia plant (see below). Inspection in 2008 found mold on \"totes\" holding peanuts, counted 43 mouse droppings on the floor, and saw a live bird walking and flying inside the warehouse.\nRecall\nThis contamination event triggered the most extensive food recall ever in U.S. history. As of April 22, 2009, it involved at least 361 companies and 3,913 different products manufactured using PCA ingredients. The recall included everything produced at the Blakely plant since January 1, 2007, as well as everything ever produced at the Plainview, Texas, plant. Products supplied for some school lunches were pulled, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) even recalled emergency meals sent after a massive ice storm. (Since the storm left many without power, the United States Postal Service went door-to-door in Kentucky to warn residents and hand out 600,000 flyers from FEMA.) Food banks nationwide had to discard thousands of pounds of food in time of high demand from millions of U.S. families in need.\nThe recall did not involve major-brand peanut butters, since PCA primarily served only low-budget and institutional providers, but many consumers reacted by avoiding peanut products altogether, driving down the sales of all brands of peanut butter by nearly 25%.\nThis caused great harm to the industry and farmers, already suffering from low prices due to the 2008 bumper crop and the deepening economic crisis. Losses to the U.S. peanut industry because of this outbreak were estimated to be $1\u00a0billion.\n2009 investigations\nGeorgia\nJournalistic\nFollowing initial reporting of the contamination's source, reporters and investigators began taking a careful look at the sites run by PCA. The Washington Post reported on February 14, 2009, the view of David Brooks, a buyer for a snack company that had visited PCA facilities in the mid-1980s (when PCA was under Hugh Parnell's control), that \"everybody in the peanut industry\" in the states involved (Georgia, Virginia, and Texas) knew of the serious sanitation issues associated with PCA; Brooks went on to state that PCA was \"a time bomb waiting to go off.\"\nFormer employees interviewed by the Chicago Tribune stated that conditions in the plant were \"filthy and nasty\", and that they would never eat the peanut butter or allow their children to eat it. One employee remembered seeing a family of baby mice in a tote of peanuts, and others recalled having to step over standing water inside the building after heavy rain. Another former employee told CBS News that he saw a rat dry-roasting in a peanut area. Another told ABC News that workers had no idea the company had positive Salmonella tests because \"that information is not",

Each character starts off marooned on their own planet, which they must conquer individually before being able to reunite as a team. There are not as many levels as Goemon 2, but there are also town areas with mini puzzles to solve. Unlike the prequels, there are no longer any first person Impact fights, however, each boss has a mini game (which can be played with up to 4 players), including Konami's puzzle game Taisen Puzzle-Dama. Another mini game is the bungee jump game where Impact has to catch the sword of an enemy mecha bungee jumper. A remake of Time Pilot is also playable in the game after all other secrets have been unlocked.\nPlot\nGoemon Impact arrives on a planet where its inhabitants look the same as him. They mistake him for their leader and start worshipping him. The planet is then attacked by Harakiri Seppukumaru. Goemon Impact then flies his friends to the planet in order to save his newfound followers.\nReception\nReception\nKurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 described the game as \"the best of all of the Mystical Ninja games\" with excellent graphics and sound quality.\nPanda of Consoles + described it as a fun game with all the ingredients from the previous games of the series that made it successful, with the addition of a fun 2 player mode. However, a second opinion given by Niico in the same review said that the game was not of the quality of Donkey Kong Country 2 or Mario, and that it lacked inspiration and was hurt by platforming sections that required millimeter precision. He also said that fans of the series would like the game, but he personally had threw in the towel and was not impressed.\n",
    "One room of the F\u00fcrstliche Bibliothek Corvey. A library with over 74,000 volumes, mostly of Romantic literature.\nThe more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of intellectual history and literary history throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging. That it was part of the Counter-Enlightenment, a reaction against the Age of Enlightenment, is generally accepted in current scholarship. Its relationship to the French Revolution, which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period, is clearly important, but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions. Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views, but a considerable number always had, or developed, a wide range of conservative views, and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism, as discussed in detail below.\nEvolution of the term \"Romanticism\"\nEtymology and origins of the term\nThe group of words with the root \"Roman\" in the various European languages, such as \"romance\" and \"Romanesque\", has a complicated history. By the 18th century, European languages \u2013 notably German, French and Slavic languages \u2013 were using the term \"Roman\" in the sense of the English word \"novel\", i.e. a work of popular narrative fiction. This usage derived from the term \"Romance languages\", which referred to vernacular (or popular) language in contrast to formal Latin. Most such novels took the form of \"chivalric romance\", tales of adventure, devotion and honour.\nThe founders of Romanticism, critics (and brothers) August Wilhelm Schlegel and Friedrich Schlegel, began to speak of romantische Poesie (\"romantic poetry\") in the 1790s, contrasting it with \"classic\" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating. Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his 1800 essay Gespr\u00e4ch \u00fcber die Poesie (\"Dialogue on Poetry\"):\nI seek and find the romantic among the older moderns, in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived.\nThe modern sense of the term spread more widely in France by its persistent use by Germaine de Sta\u00ebl in her De l'Allemagne (1813), recounting her travels in Germany. In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the \"romantic harp\" and \"classic lyre\", but in 1820 Byron could still write, perhaps slightly disingenuously,\nI perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and 'Romantic', terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago.\nIt is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name, and in 1824 the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature.\nApplication of the term to music\nAlthough the term \"Romanticism\" when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850, or else until around 1900, the contemporary application of \"romantic\" to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation. Indeed, one of the earliest sustained applications of the term to music occurs in 1789, in the M\u00e9moires of Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try. This is of particular interest because it is a French source on a subject mainly dominated by Germans, but also because it explicitly acknowledges its debt to Jean-Jacques Rousseau (himself a composer, amongst other things) and, by so doing, establishes a link to one of the major influences on the Romantic movement generally. In 1810 E. T. A. Hoffmann named Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven as \"the three masters of instrumental compositions\" who \"breathe one and the same romantic spirit\". He justified his view on the basis of these composers' depth of evocative expression and their marked individuality. In Haydn's music, according to Hoffmann, \"a child-like, serene disposition prevails\", while Mozart (in the late E-flat major Symphony, for example) \"leads us into the depths of the spiritual world\", with elements of fear, love, and sorrow, \"a presentiment of the infinite ... in the eternal dance of the spheres\". Beethoven's music, on the other hand, conveys a sense of \"the monstrous and immeasurable\", with the pain of an endless longing that \"will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions\". This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment. Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason, imagery, or any other precise concept, it came to be regarded, first in the writings of Wackenroder and Tieck and later by writers such as Schelling and Wagner, as preeminent among the arts, the one best able to express the secrets of the universe, to evoke the spirit world, infinity, and the absolute.\nThis chro",
    "Egyptian musical comedy play\nRaya Wa Sekina (Arabic: \u0631\u064a\u0627 \u0648\u0633\u0643\u064a\u0646\u0629) is an Egyptian musical comedy play. The theatrical production commenced its run in 1980 at the Freedom Theater in Cairo, and then it was performed at Alexandria, Egypt in the summer of 1982, marking a significant departure for renowned artist Shadia, as it was her sole venture into the realm of theater. Despite her initial reservations, she took on a leading role in the play. Then, the play was performed for many years in the 1980s. The play is helmed by director Hussein Kamal, with the script penned by writer Bahgat Kamar, and It starred well-known Egyptian figures such as Shadia, Soher El Bably, Abdel Moneim Madbouly, Ahmad Bedair, Naeem Issa, and Amal Salem. Set against the backdrop of Cairo, the show offered a blend of humor and music, drawing audiences into its narrative. Among the cast, Saeed Saleh took on the role of a radio broadcaster. The play unfolds over the course of three acts, comprising a total of eight scenes. It unfolds over a duration of 3 hours and 50 minutes. Some critics said that the play is based on the 1953 film and true story of two Alexandrian serial killers, directed by Salah Abu Seif.\nThe play's narrative is anchored in the real-life tale of Raya and Sakina, yet it takes a comedic turn with the introduction of a humorous characters. The storyline centers on two impoverished sisters, Raya and Sakina, who resort to murdering their stepmother, Amouna, when she attempts to coerce them into returning to their homeland. Following Amouna's death, the sisters seize her gold and devise a plan to conceal the crime. Raya enters into marriage with Hasab Allah, while Sakina weds Abd El-'Al, an officer in the police department, in an effort to deflect suspicion. This scheme becomes a pattern for them, as they lure unsuspecting women into their home, subsequently killing them and pilfering their gold.\nShadia, renowned for her prowess in other artistic domains, had adamantly steered clear of theatrical ventures until director Hussein Kamal proposed an unconventional approach. Initially hesitant, fearing a potential dent in her established reputation should she falter on stage, Shadia reluctantly agreed to peruse the script. However, upon immersing herself in the narrative, she found herself drawn to the lead role, prompting her to take a daring leap into the world of theater. As the curtains rose on the play's debut in Alexandria in the summer of 1982, tensions flared between Shadia and fellow actor Hamdy Ahmed, leading to him ultimatum for his exclusion from the production. Her demand was met, and Ahmad Bedair assumed the role, ensuring the seamless continuation of the play's run for several years thereafter.\nPlot\nA picture of the real Raya and Sekina, who serve as the focal point of the play.\nThe play commences by introducing Abd El-'Al (Ahmad Bedair), a new officer in the urban area who hails from a distant village and struggles to adapt to city life. Shortly thereafter, Amouna, the stepmother of Raya (Shadia) and Sekina (Soher El Bably), enters the scene. The two sisters, grappling with poverty, resort to murdering Amouna after she pressures them to return to their homeland, seizing her gold in the process. To dispose of the body, Raya weds Hasaballah (Abdel Moneim Madbouly), who assists in burying Amouna in the basement.\nSubsequently, the trio embarks on a spree of killings in the El Labban neighborhood, targeting women. As reports of missing women escalate, suspicions arise within the police force. To allay these suspicions, Sekina marries Abd El-'Al, and unbeknownst to him, the trio continue their gruesome activities without Abd El-'Al's knowledge. The missing women, often adorned with gold jewelry and carrying substantial amounts of money, are frequently last seen in the company of the sisters. Despite repeated questioning, Sekina manages to evade suspicion until the truth is ultimately revealed to Abd El-'Al and the authorities, leading to their execution.\n",

    "\nKelsey Hatzell is an American materials scientist who is a professor at Princeton University. Hatzell studies new materials for sustainable technologies, with a focus on next-generation energy storage. She is interested in the nanoscale phenomena responsible for battery failure.\nEarly life and education\nHatzell studied economics at Swarthmore College and mechanical engineering at Pennsylvania State University. She moved to Drexel University for her doctoral research, where she studied flowable electrodes for water and energy technologies with Yury Gogotsi. Her research involved electrochemistry, materials and colloidal science to create new electrode structures. She developed carbon-based and manganese oxide materials for scalable solid-state energy storage systems. After graduating, she moved to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where she developed soft and hard x-ray techniques to understand the properties of polymers.\nResearch and career\nHatzell was appointed an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University. Hatzell joined Princeton University in 2021. Her research considers new materials for sustainable technologies, with a focus on solid-state and redox flow batteries. She is particularly interested in why batteries fail. She identified that irregularities in electrolytes impacted the movement of ions, which could cause battery failure if the ions all migrated to particular locations. Hatzell has created inorganic membranes for high energy density batteries and grid storage.\nHatzell has developed strategies to minimize the costs of direct air capture systems, which generally require energy-intensive operating protocols to reduce the impact of carbon emissions and remove them from the atmosphere. These systems conventionally rely on heat or pressure changes to release captured carbon dioxide into storage (e.g. solvents heated to high temperatures). Hatzell developed an ion-exchange resin, which efficiently capture carbon dioxide at low humidity and release it at high humidity \u2013 without the need for high temperatures.\nAwards and honors\n2015 Drexel Office of Graduate Studies Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award\n2020 Sloan Research Fellowship\n2020 Scialog Fellow\n2021 National Science Foundation CAREER Award\n2021 POLiS Award of Excellence\n2022 NASA Early Career Achievement Medal\n2023 Alfred Rheinstein Faculty Award\n2023 Office of Naval Research Award\n2024 Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award\nSelected publications\nChang E Ren; Kelsey B Hatzell; Mohamed Alhabeb; Zheng Ling; Khaled A Mahmoud; Yury Gogotsi (September 25, 2015). \"Charge- and Size-Selective Ion Sieving Through Ti3C2Tx MXene Membranes\".

    "Lake in Poland\nCh\u0142op Lake is a ribbon lake located within the Pszczew Landscape Park, in the Lubusz Voivodeship, in the Mi\u0119dzyrzecz County, in the Gmina Pszczew. About 1\u00a0km from the northern end of the lake lies the town of Pszczew.\nLocation and description\nCh\u0142op Lake is located in the central part of the Pszczew Landscape Park. The southeastern shore of the lake marks the border between the Lubusz and Greater Poland Voivodeships. Ch\u0142op Lake is a ribbon lake of glacial origin, quite large and relatively deep. It stretches from north to south and has a well-developed shoreline with a narrow, winding bay in the eastern part, into which the large peninsula known as Jelenia G\u0142owa protrudes from the south. The lake is almost entirely surrounded by forests. Along the eastern shore of the lake, there are elevations, with the highest, G\u00f3ra Wysoka, rising to 101 meters above sea level. There is one small island on the lake. The bottom of the body of water is diverse, with several deeper spots and numerous shallows. Three small streams flow into the lake, two of which periodically dry up. Excess water is drained to the south by a small stream into W\u0119dromierz Lake.\nHydronymics\nThe lake appears in sources as early as 1460, initially as Chlop, and later as: Chlop (1564, 1594), Ch\u0142op (1640), Klop See (1845), Klopp See (1940). Currently, the standardized name Ch\u0142op is in use, and the national register of geographic names does not list any alternative or additional names.\nMorphometrics\nAccording to the data from the Inland Fisheries Institute, the surface area of the lake's water mirror is 2.28 square kilometers, while A. Choi\u0144ski, using a planimeter on maps at a scale of 1:50,000, determined the lake's size to be 2.23 square kilometers. The uniform part of the lake's surface waters covers an area of 215 hectares.\nThe average depth of the water reservoir is 9.0 meters, and the maximum depth is 23.0 meters. The volume of the lake is 20,579.6 thousand m3. The maximum length of the lake is 4.15 kilometers, and the width is 0.97 kilometers. The length of the shoreline is 12.35 kilometers.\nAccording to the Atlas of Polish Lakes (ed. J. Ja\u0144czak, 1996), the water level is at an altitude of 53.7 meters above sea level, while according to the numerical terrain model provided by Geoportal, the water level is at an altitude of 52.5 meters above sea level.\nAccording to the Map of Hydrographic Division of Poland, the lake is located in the drainage basin of the tenth level. The identifier is 187875921. The direct drainage basin of the lake covers an area of 77.2\u00a0km2.\nDevelopment\nIn the water management system, the lake forms a uniform water body part with the code PLLW10360. The administrator is the Regional Water Management Board in Pozna\u0144, which has established a fishery district covering the waters of this lake called the Fishery District of Ch\u0142op Lake on the Struga Wro\u0144ska watercourse \u2013 No. 1. The fishery management on the lake is conducted by the Trzciel Fisheries Farm.\nThe lake serves recreational purposes. In 2006, there were several recreational centers, two camping sites, and numerous holiday cottages around the lake. On the eastern shore of the water body near G\u00f3ra Wysoka, one of three identical observation towers built by the Gmina Pszczew is located. The tower measures 18.66 meters.\nWater purity and environmental protection\nIn the years 1985, 1994, 2000, and 2006, the waters of Ch\u0142op Lake were classified as Class II purity. Comparing the results from these years indicates that the water quality of Ch\u0142op Lake has not undergone significant changes. Over the years, water transparency has fluctuated depending on the season, ranging from 1.7 to 3.7 meters. Environmental inspectors from the Regional Inspectorate for Environmental Protection pointed out that the construction of a sewage treatment plant for Pszczew in 1996, along with the discharge of treated sewage directly into the Obra river, outside the lake's catchment area, contributed to maintaining water quality. The closure of the distillery in Pszczew, which was discharging sewage directly into the lake, also had a positive impact on water cleanliness.\nCh\u0142op Lake has been classified as fairly resistant to degrading external influences, thus falling into the II category of susceptibility to degradation. This means that it is a lake with good natural conditions. Factors negatively affecting this indicator include a low level of thermal stratification and the shoreline-to-volume ratio. On the other hand, factors contributing positively to the lake's resilience include low water turnover (40% annually), a relatively small catchment area compared to its volume, considerable average depth, and the predominance of forests in the immediate vicinity of the lake.\nResearch conducted in 2020 classified the waters of the lake as having a good ecological status, corresponding to Class II quality. The classification was based on the ecological status of macrophytes, ichthyofauna, and be",
    "\nHermann Epenstein (born 1850 or 1851 in Berlin; died June 5, 1934 in Mauterndorf), known from 1910 until the abolition of nobility in Austria in 1919 as Hermann Epenstein Ritter von Mauternburg; was a German-Austrian physician and merchant.\nHe was best known as the owner of Mauterndorf Castle, which he had extensively rebuilt, refurbished and restored; and for being the godfather, and later stepfather, to Albert and Hermann G\u00f6ring.\nBiography\nEpenstein was the son of a Catholic mother and father who had converted from Judaism to marry, and was therefore considered a Mischling (half-Jew) in Nazi terminology. He became a royal Prussian staff physician. Through trade, he became very wealthy and held politically German nationalist views.\nDuring a stay in German South West Africa, he met the local imperial commissioner Heinrich Ernst G\u00f6ring and his wife Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859\u201315 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant, whom he assisted in childbirth. Back in Germany, the G\u00f6rings lived in his house in Berlin-Friedenau (Fregestra\u00dfe 19). Franziska became Epenstein's lover. She openly maintained the relationship with him, staying with him during visits while her husband was accommodated elsewhere. Epenstein became the godfather of all five of G\u00f6ring's children from his second marriage, including Hermann and Albert.\nIn 1894, Epenstein acquired the dilapidated Mauterndorf Castle in Salzburg and had it rebuilt by 1904. In 1897, he also bought Veldenstein Castle north of Nuremberg for 20,000 marks. He invested over a million marks until 1914 to restore the castle's former appearance. Epenstein made the castle available as a residence for the G\u00f6ring family. Hermann G\u00f6ring also visited his \"adoptive father\" Epenstein at Mauterndorf Castle, which he later called \"the castle of his youth.\" Epenstein's fondness for castles and medieval splendor shaped the young Hermann's imagination.\nIn 1909, Epenstein became an Austrian citizen and lived in Mauterndorf after World War I. In appreciation of the reconstruction of Mauterndorf Castle, Emperor Franz Joseph I ennobled him on August 8, 1910, into the knightly rank.\nIn 1913, relations soured between the G\u00f6rings and Epenstein after he married for the first time at the age of 62: the much younger Elisabeth \"Lilly\" Schandrovich Edle von Kriegstreu (1887\u20131939).\nAfter the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, G\u00f6ring found refuge with Epenstein in Mauterndorf. When Epenstein died in 1934, he left the castles to his wife, who in turn appointed G\u00f6ring, as per Epenstein's wish, as the heir.\n",

    "Spanish footballer and manager\nArsenio Arocha Guill\u00e9n (22 August 1912 \u2013 14 October 1990) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Madrid FC and Real Betis, winning a Copa del Rey with the former in 1934 and a La Liga title with the latter in 1934\u201335. He was also known as Arocha II in order to be distinguished from his older brother \u00c1ngel Arocha. He later became a manager, taking charge over UD Las Palmas in 1950.\nPlaying career\nBorn in Chimiche\u00a0, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Arocha began his football career at CD Tenerife, where he reached the highest levels in Canary Islands football at that time, becoming a part of the team that for many fans has been the best Tenerife side in its history, which was Champion of the Canary Islands in 1932 and that subsequently participated in the 1932 Spanish Cup.\nThis Tenerife team was made up of players who would soon confirm their category by being signed, most of them, by clubs from the first division, including Arocha, who was signed in 1933 by Real Madrid, where he had few chances. In fact, he only played two matches for the club, one in the cup and one in the Centro Regional Championship, and by playing in these matches, Arocha thus belonged to the squad that then won the titles. Due to the difficulty in finding a place among the starting eleven, he decided to leave the club at the end of the 1933\u201334 season, and joined Real Betis, for whom he played until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.\nManagerial career\nA few years after retiring, Arocha returned to football as a coach, taking over RCD C\u00f3rdoba in the 1947\u201348 season and then UD Las Palmas in the 1950\u201351 season. When he was the coach of UD Tenerife in 1943\u201344, Arocha agreed to the request of Luis Molowny, then a boy, to have him play, and after observing his great aptitudes at the end of the training session, Arocha said: \"If you wish, you can consider yourself a player for the youth team CD Tenerife\", and in fact, Molowny triumphed that season as a youth forward and his move to the top team.\nIn January 1950, Arocha, then linked to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, was chosen as the coach of the Canary Islands autonomous football team for a match against the powerful Argentinian team of San Lorenzo de Almagro, and he formed a Canarian XI made up of seven Gran Canarians, three Tenerifens and one Palmero, which also had the likes of Luis Molowny and Rosendo Hern\u00e1ndez, and in the end, his selection and his leadership paid off as the Canaries won 4\u20132. Speaking of Molowny, it is claimed that Arocha was the one who recommended him to Real.\nHonours\nMadrid FC\nCopa del Rey:\nChampions (1): 1934\nReal Betis\nCopa del Rey:\nChampions (1): 1935\nSee also\nList of Real Madrid CF players\n",
    "\nThe Viscounts of Azpa were the rulers of the Viscountcy of Azpa. The Viscountcy takes its name from the town of Azpa, a locality and council located in the municipality of Valle de Eg\u00fc\u00e9s, in Navarre province, Spain. The Viscountcy of Azpa is a hereditary Spanish noble title granted by the Kings of Spain in the mid 16th century to the Medrano family in Navarre who were later granted the title Marquess of Fontellas.\nList of Viscounts of Azpa\nHistory\nTown of Azpa\nAzpa is situated at the southeastern tip of the Eg\u00fc\u00e9s Valley and is the final locality accessible via national road 150. Azpa holds significant historical interest and boasts an ancient lordship attached to the Medrano family, with remnants of its noble past still visible. The town is home to the palace of the Viscount of Azpa and Marquis of Fontellas, a family noted for Don Jaime V\u00e9laz de Medrano's involvement in the historic battle of Amaiur-Maya in 1522.\nCoat of arms of the Velaz de Medrano family in Navarre (the Armory Book of the Kingdom of Navarre, 16th century)\nAt the entrance of Azpa is a building known as The Palace, which forms a horizontal block, with a semicircular arch as the entrance and a baroque shield on the facade. Carlos V\u00e9laz de Medrano was once the lord of the palaces and pechas of Azpa and Mendillori. The palace of Azpa appears as a corporal of armory on the official payroll of the Kingdom. Azpa is located 16km east of Pamplona. The palace of Azpa belonged in 1631 to Alonso V\u00e9laz de Medrano y Navarra, III Viscount of Azpa, whose guardian, on his behalf, brought a lawsuit in the chamber over the rebate of the barracks. In those years, the firstborn of the Medrano lineage already bore the title of viscounts of Azpa.\nII Viscount\nOn 6 August 1604, Deputy Alonso V\u00e9laz de Medrano, II Viscount of Azpa, served as the military representative in the Deputation of the Kingdom, where he played a key role in representing the interests of the crown and military. He married a Lady from the royal House of Navarra, a minor branch of the House of \u00c9vreux, from the French Capetain dynasty.\nIII Viscount\nAlonso Velaz de Medrano y Navarra, III Viscount of Azpa married Mar\u00eda de Ripalda y Ayanz de Ureta and together they had 8 children in Azpa. On 27 December 1642, Alonso V\u00e9laz de Medrano y Navarra was representing the university Deputation of the Kingdom. Mar\u00eda de Ripalda was the daughter of Luis de Ripalda and Mar\u00eda Ayanz de Ureta. Luis de Ripalda's parents were Luis Ripalda and Agueda Amatriain. Luis de Ripalda, later known as the Count of Ripalda, married Mar\u00eda Sebasti\u00e1n. Mar\u00eda Sebasti\u00e1n's father was Salvador Sebasti\u00e1n, who was the uncle of Luis Sebasti\u00e1n y Donamar\u00eda, the lord of Iriberri.\nIV and V Viscount\nJos\u00e9 Velaz de Medrano y Navarra, IV Viscount of Azpa and Lord of Mendillori married Ana Mar\u00eda de Larrea Zunzarren, also known as Lady Beunza Larrea, who lived from around 1660 to 1711. Together, they had two children:\nJos\u00e9pha Velaz de Medrano y Larrea, (b. 1685 Peralta - 1711 in Irunea), who married Francisco Argaiz Galdeano VI\nJoaquin Velaz de Medrano y Larrea, V Viscount of Azpa, born around 1690 in Irunea.\nJos\u00e9 Velaz de Medrano y Navarra held several prestigious titles, including IV Viscount of Azpa and Lord of Autol and Mendillorri. He was also the Owner of the Entailed Estate and Palaces of Cape of Arms of Beunza-Larrea and Ripalda. On 28 February 1692 Jos\u00e9 V\u00e9laz de Medrano, Viscount of Medrano, IV Viscount of Azpa, was a representative of the Military Deputation. On 16 December 1699 Jos\u00e9 V\u00e9laz de Medrano, Viscount of Azpa replaced Juan Ventura de Arizcun, Viscount of Arbeloa in the University Deputation.\nDon Jos\u00e9 was the lord of Mendillori and the town of Autol in the 18th century. In 1716, Jos\u00e9's daughter Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Francisca V\u00e9laz de Medrano was married to Gabriel Cano de Aponte, Royal Governor of Chile from 1717 to 1733. Jos\u00e9 V\u00e9laz de Medrano, Viscount of Azpa, Lord of Autol, was noted for his claim against the Deputation of the Kingdom, regarding payment of 508 ducats for the expenses of a trip to Madrid.\nVI Viscount\nHermitage of Our Lady of Nieva in Autol, La Rioja, a town in the historic viscountcy of Azpa\nJoaqu\u00edn V\u00e9laz de Medrano was the 6th Viscount of Azpa, lord of Mendillorri, Buenzalarrea, labaso, Amalain, Villanuevo, Autol, Yerga, etc.\nOn 23 March 1726, Don Joaqu\u00edn V\u00e9laz de Medrano, Viscount of Azpa served as the university representative in the Deputation of the Kingdom alongside Don El\u00edas \u00cd\u00f1iguez de Medrano. On 29 October 1749, Don Joaquin Velaz de Medrano, Viscount of Azpa and lord of the town of Autol, residing in the city of Pamplona, outlined the legitimacy of his claim in the lawsuit under review by the council. This legal dispute involves the Lords Prosecutors, along with the local council, judiciary, regiment, and residents of the town, regarding the return of the town of Autol, including its jurisdiction, lordship, and vassalage, to the Crown.\nAmong the 20 council members repeatedly elected in Pamplona, Joaqu\u00edn V\u00e9laz d",
    "Spanish footballer and manager\nArcadio Arteaga O\u00f1ate (6 December 1902), also known by his nickname Quirico Arteaga, was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Athletic Bilbao and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\nHe later became a manager, taking charge over Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Recreativo de Huelva, and Real Valladolid.\nPlaying career\nArteaga was born in the Biscayan town of Bilbao on 6 December 1902, and he began his football career at SD Erandio Club in 1922, at the age of 19. While there, he stood out as a solid midfielder, so he eventually became part of the first team of Athletic Bilbao in 1924, making his official debut on 11 October 1925, helping his side to a 5\u20130 win over Sestao Sport Club. He remained at Athletic Club until 1928, playing a total of 34 competitive matches, including 9 Copa del Rey games and 25 in the Biscay Championship, which he won three times in 1925\u201326, 1926\u201327, and 1927\u201328.\nIn 1928, Arteaga signed for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, making his official debut as a colchonero on 16 September 1928 in a Centro Regional Championship fixture against the CD Nacional de Madrid, which ended in a 3\u20131 victory. He then played in the inaugural La Liga season in 1929, although he was unable to avoid his team being relegated to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. In Atl\u00e9tico, he formed a memorable midfield with Victoriano de Santos and Eduardo Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, which became known as the \"three musketeers\". He hung up his boots in 1932, at the end of his fourth season at Atl\u00e9tico. In total, he played 104 official matches, 37 in the Biscay Championship, 11 in the cup, and 56 in the league, 36 of which in the first division, but he never managed to score a single goal.\nManagerial career\nAfter his career as a player ended, Arteaga remained linked to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as a coach, taking charge of the club for a brief period of time at the end of the 1932\u201333 season. He oversaw a total of six matches with a balance of three wins, two losses, and a draw, plus 13 goals scored and 9 conceded. After leaving Atl\u00e9tico, he coached another Madrid team, the AD Ferroviaria, before signing in 1936 for CD Badajoz\u00a0.\nAfter the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, Arteaga directed Recreativo de Huelva in the 1940\u201341 season, from where he then moved to UD Salamanca, which he coached from 1941 to 1943 in the Second Division. In his first season at the club, he signed Pruden from Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n, the top scorer of the first division in the previous season, and this investment paid off as they ended up having an excellent campaign and qualified in second position to play for promotion to the top division, and although they did not achieve it, Arteaga went down in history as the first sports director in Salamanca's history to compete for a promotion to the top division. In a second unfortunate season, Arteaga was dismissed in May 1943, following its relegation to the third division. Days before his dismissal, Salamanca lost 5\u20131 to Real Madrid in the first leg of the 1943 Copa del General\u00edsimo, and he responded forcefully to a question about the return fixture, stating, \"Salamanca in Calvary will, yes, make the greatest of its efforts; because the opposite would not be his norm and would also constitute a serious sin of unsportsmanlike behavior\".\nHis next team was SD Ceuta in the 1943\u201344 season in the Second Division. Arteaga was then commissioned by Real Valladolid in the 1944\u201345 season, to raise a team that had just been relegated to third division, but he was not able to achieve it. In 1944\u201345, however, Valladolid reached the final of the 1944\u201345 Copa Federaci\u00f3n de Espa\u00f1a, which ended in a 0\u20131 loss to FC Martinenc. In 1945 his name was considered to be named the Spanish national manager, although he was finally not chosen for the position, which Jacinto Quincoces went on to hold.\nIn 1946 he refused to coach Cartagena FC, accepting the offer of CD Logro\u00f1\u00e9s, which he would coach, in the third division in the 1946\u201347 season.\nFrom that moment on, there are no more references to his sporting career, nor is there any date on which his death occurred. His name does not appear among those who, starting in 1949, obtained the title of coach in Spain.\nHonours\nPlayer\nAthletic Bilbao\nBiscay Championship: 1925\u201326, 1926\u201327, and 1927\u201328\nManager\nReal Valladolid\nCopa Federaci\u00f3n de Espa\u00f1a: Runner-up in 1944\u201345\n",

    "Climate change activist\nGrace Oluchi Mbah (born 22 January 1994) is a climate change activist. She co-founded the Climate Action Africa (CAA) on July 14, 2021, with Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata. It is a non-government and non-profit organization that focuses on addressing the climate issues in Africa and beyond. The organization partners with institutions, professional associations, government, civil society organizations, business owners and individuals to enhance strategies for innovative practices on sustainable environment and development of Africa for all.\nThe organization organizes learning spaces for children to know about climate change and start early to be the change agent for a friendly environment. Climate change has become a global discussion with strategies for saving humans and other species of living things therein. The warning on global warming has created impacts that led to the redesigning of how to shape the environment and create the world we want with control of the temperature and weather patterns.\nEducation and early life\nGrace has a B.Sc. in Banking and Finance. She also has an MBA in Business Management.\nActivities\nGrace's career in activism on climate change stemmed from the effects of loss, destruction of life and property, damage to agricultural products and the issues of the waste of resources due to global warming in Nigeria. Even though, climate change is a natural phenomenon, Grace and her team carry out sensitization and advocacy and build partnerships with the indication that not attending to climate change will have a resultant effect on health, agriculture, environment, economy, society and all aspects of human endeavor. According to Grace, \u201cNigeria\u2019s vulnerability to climate change necessitates immediate and collective action. Through this partnership, we aspire to harness the power of innovation, sustainable practices, policy dialogue, and community engagement to reshape Nigeria\u2019s future and set a global example.\u201d They develop ideation and provide facilities on climate change.\nThey launched Climate Action Africa Labs (CAA Labs) which created an innovation that supports the development of the climate-tech startup ecosystem in Africa. Collaborating with the government, researchers, scientists, and experts, the CAA Labs addressed the changing climate issues, and evidence-based policy decisions on the continent support the translation of research discoveries as well as climate-tech organizations and startups in developing sustainable solutions.\nGrace with her team under Climate Action Africa established and launched Climate Stories 4 Kids. This is focused on educating and nurturing children and young adults to be aware of climate change and to begin early to protect their communities. It is a \u201ccatch them young \u201dinitiative with audio-visual and digital viewing content. The project targets one million young minds across the world with designed fiction on climate change based on real-life settings. According to the Director, \u201cOur children are the future stewards of this planet. When we make climate education exciting and accessible, we empower them to take charge of their environmental destiny and become advocates for change. That is exactly what we are doing.\u201d The Climate Stories 4 Kids series is meant to be aired on radio and TV stations. The idea of children and young adults knowing climate change rhymes with the UNICEF concern that children are affected by access to water, health, education, food security and well-being. The essence is that climate change can be mitigated if safety and knowledge are enhanced.\nAgain, the report by the African Child Forum stated that \u201calmost 1 billion children \u2013 nearly half of the world\u2019s children \u2013 live in countries that are at extremely high risk of climate change impacts. Climate change has direct and indirect impacts on children\u2019s rights to health, life, dignity and education. Also, climate change increases the risk of exposure to violence against children. Climate-induced disasters displace people, and limit access to schools, adequate water, and nutrition.\u201d Hence effective direction towards climate change with children will probably have a good effect on controlling the ecosystem.\nGrace participated in the Africa Climate Summit in Kenya focused on tackling climate issues in Africa, from 4 to 6 September 2023 at the Kenyatta International Convention Center (KICC) in Nairobi, Kenya. This summit was attended by other climate activists, government personnel and other stakeholders. The Africa Climate Summit of 2023 provided a platform for policymakers, practitioners, businesses and civil society that caused interactions on climate solutions, challenges and strategies as well as opportunities achieved in different regions. This led to the first global stocktaking that was concluded at the COP28 in UAE in December 2023. Grace signed a memorandum of associations (MoU), collaborated and participated in climate change events for creating a friendly ",
    "Greek railway station\nDilofos railway station (Greek: \u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u0394\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, romanized:\u00a0Sidirodromiki stasi Dilofos) is a small unstaffed\nrailway station that serves the village of Dikaia, Evros, in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Located just north of the settlement, Today Hellenic Train operates just two daily regional trains to Alexandroupoli and Ormenio.\nHistory\nThe railway was an important link during World War I as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary were all Central Allies. After the Ottoman Empire's defeat, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi) in Turkey serving Edirne Karaaga\u00e7 station and for 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi) between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (CFFH), a subsidiary of the CO, when the CFFH was incorporated in July 1929.\nUnder the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, which had the result that the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entered Greece at Pythio, then re-entered Turkey at Edirne (Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 railway station), re-entered Greece at Marasia, and finally entered Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad.  This arrangement continued until 1971 when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed through Feres. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE taking over responsibilities for most for Greece's rail infrastructure. In the 1990s, OSE introduced the InterCity service to the Alexandroupoli\u2013Svilengrad line Which reduced travel times across the whole line.\nin 2017, limerted works where carreid out at the station, the buildings where painted, and the platform was paved. In 2020 it was announced that the section of line between Pythio and Ormenio was to be upgraded, at the cost of \u20ac1.4 million as part of an ambitious integrated intergovernmental transport plan which will see this, and 39 other transport sector projects be built, with financing from the European Commission with a total of \u20ac117\u00a0million. The package of measures aims to build or improve transport connections and connectivity across Europe, with a focus on sustainable transport. The project for the Pythian-Ormenio section envisions upgrading the existing line infrastructure and trackbed, doubling of the track as well as the installation of electrification signalling (ETCS Level 1) along the entire stretch, with the aim of improving freight transport with Bulgaria and Turkey.\nFacilities\nThe station is housed in its original station building, however this is now closed.

    "Swedish lichenologist (1914\u20131992)\nOve Almborn (30 July 1914 \u2013 6 March 1992) was a Swedish lichenologist and educator. Born in Ronneby, Sweden, Almborn grew up in an environment that nurtured his early interest in botany and lichens. His early academic interests and discoveries in new lichens inspired his doctoral dissertation, which focused on the distribution and ecology of lichens in South Scandinavia. After graduating from Lund University, he was employed at its department of systematic botany, initially as a senior lecturer and later as the curator of the botanical collections at its botanical garden.\nAlmborn's research advanced the understanding of lichen funga in southern Scandinavia and Southern Africa. 'Funga' refers to the fungal components of these ecosystems. He conducted extensive fieldwork and published numerous papers on the subject that contributed to the knowledge of lichen biogeography and ecology. He also edited the Lichenes Africani exsiccata series and authored multiple studies on African lichens. Almborn profoundly impacted his students' careers and personal growth through dedicated mentorship. He was known for his extensive botanical literature collection and his supportive mentorship of students in systematic botany.\nEarly life and education\nOve Almborn was born on 30 July 1914 in Ronneby, located in the southeastern Swedish province of Blekinge. Almborn's fascination with botany began in his youth in Ronneby. Bertil Hedvall introduced Ove Almborn to lichenology, sparking his interest in the subject during high school in the nearby city of Karlskrona. Almborn attended Lund University in 1933. In university, he studied chemistry, zoology, and botany.\nAlmborn's first scientific publication was about the lichens on the exterior of the Lund Cathedral, a portion of which is pictured here in 1935.\nAlmborn's first contribution to the lichenological literature was a 1935 publication exploring the lichen biodiversity occurring on the historic Lund Cathedral. Influenced significantly by Gunnar Degelius and other figures from the Uppsala circle led by Gustaf Einar Du Rietz, Almborn's doctoral thesis in 1948 reflected the Uppsala school's approach to plant ecology and phytosociology, focusing on the distribution and ecology of certain lichens in southern Scandinavia. His academic journey led him to discover unique lichens and inspired his doctoral dissertation on the distribution and ecology of South Scandinavian lichens. His findings hinted at broader applications for conservation efforts.\nCareer\nAfter obtaining his degree in 1936, Almborn was appointed as a docent at Lund University. His research during this period focused on exploring the lichen funga of Southern Africa. Despite facing challenges during his thesis defence due to a pollen allergy, he passed with commendable remarks.\nAcademic and field research\nIn 1955, Almborn conducted a study of the lichens on the island of Hallands V\u00e4der\u00f6. This research not only helped document the ecological diversity of the island but also set the stage for his future explorations and contributions to the understanding of lichen funga in various regions.\nAlmborn's research in Southern Africa began in 1953, funded by a grant from the Swedish Natural Science Research Council. There, he broadened understanding of the region's lichen populations and fostered international collaborations. During his first trip, he explored and collected lichen specimens in South Africa and Mozambique. He returned in 1983\u201384 to gather more material, further enriching his research. Between 1956 and 1991, Almborn edited 150 issues of the Lichenes Africani exsiccata series, and authored multiple additional studies on African lichens.\nFrom 1954 to 1966, Almborn balanced his role as a high school teacher in Malm\u00f6 with his passion for lichenology, contributing to the field through various publications and research. His dedication to education was evident in his efforts to integrate research with teaching. Much of his spare time during this period was spent building up collections of lichens.\nEducational contributions\nStarting in 1966, Almborn was a collection curator in the herbarium of Lund University's Botaniska tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden (Botanical Garden).\nIn 1966, Almborn became the curator of the herbarium at the Lund University Botanical Museum, where he furthered his contributions to botany and lichenology, maintaining high standards and fostering international collaboration. He was known for his extensive collection of botanical literature and for mentoring students with a supportive and systematic approach.\nIn the late 1940s, Hans Runemark worked on the yellow species of the crustose lichen genus Rhizocarpon, with Ove Almborn as his supervisor.\nIn 1971, Almborn met Ingvar K\u00e4rnefelt. He subsequently became K\u00e4rnefelt's supervisor, guiding his graduate studies. K\u00e4rnefelt eventually established his own career as a renowned lichenologist.\nOve Almborn was celebrated not only for his pioneering re",
    "1904 photograph of the sidewalk outside the Lyceum Theatre. Made by the Boston Transit Commission.\nThe Lyceum Theatre was a theatre in Boston, Massachusetts located at 661-667 Washinton St at the corner of Boylston and Washington streets. It opened as the Boylston Museum (also called the New Boylston Museum) in 1875 at 667 Washington St. It operated as both a theatre and a dime museum. Its founder, George E. Lothrop, acquired the adjacent properties and greatly expanded the theatre. This expanded facility opened as the World's Museum (also called World's Theatre and the World's Museum, Menagerie and Aquarium) in 1885. In 1892 the theatre ceased being a dime museum and was renamed the Lyceum Theatre after undergoing significant alterations. It was demolished in June 1908.  The Gaiety Theatre was built on the same site in 1908.\nBoylston Museum (1875-1885)\n1875 photograph of the Boylston Museum.\nThe Boylston Museum was founded by George E. Lothrop in 1875, at 667 Washington St adjacent to Boylston Market. Lothrop was a graduate of Dartmouth Medical School who left a career as a physician to pursue a career in theatre management. A dime museum as well as a theatre, a review in The Boston Globe on May 14, 1875, described the site as a \"cozy little theatrum\" and that the museum contained a \"collection of curiousities  large and interesting\". It also described the theatre as offering daily afternoon and evening performances with both dramas and variety entertainments as offerings.\nThe Boylston Museum operated primarily as a variety theatre during the vaudeville era. The theatre sat 930 people and it charged 10 to 50 cents for tickets to its performances. The actor Horace Lewis (1854\u20131905) made his professional debut at the Boylston Museum during its first year of operation, starring as Mr. Primrose in an 1875 production of A Tight Place. Singer Maggie Cline was also an early performer at the theatre who began her career on the Boylston stage. By 1876 advertisements for the Boylton Museum began referring to the museum as the New Boylston Museum and its theatre as the Star Novelty Theatre.\nFor the Christmas 1877 season the actress Sadie Martinot was engaged for performances. Martinot became a favorite performer for Boston audiences in minstrel shows staged at the Boylston. George M. Cohan's father, Jere Cohan, worked as a stage manager at the Boylston Museum, and the Four Cohans sometimes gave six shows a day at the Boylston's theatre. Denman Thompson performed a highly popular sketch at the theatre, \"Uncle Josh\", which he later developed into the longer play The Old Homestead, which for a period held the record for the longest running play in the history of the American theatre.\nOther vaudeville entertainers to appear at the Boylston Museum included comedian Neil Burgess; actors Charles L. Davis (1870\u20131920) and Charles H. Yale; and acrobat and singing actress Carrie Swain. The museum and theatre stopped operating in April 1885 in order to expand and transform the enterprise into the World's Theatre.\nWorld's Museum (1885-1892)\nCojoined twins Millie and Christine McKoy.\nAlbino sisters Florence and Mary Martin\n1882 photograph of dwarf General Willis Carver (center) with his parents. His mother Cora Carver (left) worked as a professional fat lady and was often displayed alongside her tiny son.\nLothrop decided to expand the size of his operation and acquired the 661, 663, and 665 Washington St properties to significantly enlarge the size of both the theatre and the museum. The builder of the museum was H. Roberts. Asa Lowe & Co. did the mason work, the Chelmsford Foundry Co. did the iron work, artist J. A. Teeling painted several murals in the building, J. Kelley & Co. made stained glass windows, Gill & Higgins provided French colored glass, and much of the interior design work was done by The Boston Wall Paper Co.\nThe much enlarged and essentially new facility reopened as the World's Museum, Menagerie, and Aquarium on Monday October 5, 1885. A variety program was presented in the theatre on opening day that featured African-American comedian Tom McIntosh, mentalist Madame Lee, singer Georgia Marsh, and many other performers of varying talents. It was reported that more than 50,000 people attended the museum during its first week of operation.\nExtending an entire city block, the World's Museum consisted of four floors and could accommodate 7,000 people. It was wired with electricity and had many crystal chandeliers lit by colored lights. The first floor of the building contained a vestibule with a large fountain, a theatre that could seat 1,000 people, and an aquarium. The second floor consisted of two large halls containing a wide array of \"curiosities\".\nThe third floor consisted of a menagerie. The menagerie contained both animals on display in cages and performing animals. Some of the animals who performed included \"Pendrinelli's trained monkeys\", an elephant named Bijou who could perform tricks of varying kinds, \"Ba",

    "The Dedham Inn was an inn on Court Street in Dedham, Massachusetts. It housed several notable guests at the corner of Court Street and Highland Street before burning down in 1939.\nEarly history\nDuring the American Revolution, General Lafayette's men camped on the land that would later adjoin the inn.\nThe home was built in 1791 and was said to have been designed by Charles Bulfinch.\nA year before the construction, the land was sold to John M. Lovell for 36 pounds. In 1792, Lovell sold the house and land to Samuel Brock Jr. for 576 pounds. The next  owner was John Madey, who sold it to Alexander Hodgdon in 1795. His widow sold it to Samuel \"Blind Samuel\" Richards in 1803. Richards was born in Dedham but later moved to Boston and became a hardware merchant. After going blind, he returned to Dedham.\nRichards' son, Edward Metcalf Richards, later owned the house. His wife, Rebecca (n\u00e9e\u00a0Guild), said that when she first moved into the home that as many as 20 stagecoaches a day would pass by the house, many stopping at Gay's Tavern across the street. The rear portion of the home was torn down in 1878 and a new addition added. The home and land would remain in the Richard family for 114 years.\nUse as an inn\nIn 1915, the house was purchased by Robert M. Morse, expanded, and converted into an inn. It quickly became a popular venue for events.\nJust a few years later, in 1919, Mary Miles Minter and William Desmond Taylor stayed at the inn while filming Anne of Green Gables. In 1920, a film version of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem The Bell of Atri was filmed in Dedham on the Town Common. The major players ate at the Dedham Inn.\nDuring the Sacco and Vanzetti trial, the sequestered jurors would eat at the inn. So, too, would judge Webster Thayer, the newspapermen covering the trial, and most of those connected with the courthouse. Several of those newspapermen would later submit an affidavit that swore they heard Thayer making prejudicial remarks at the inn.\nFire\nIn 1927, George Thorley purchased the inn. At 3:30 in the morning of February 6, 1939 Thorley's cockerspaniel, Josephine began barking and woke up the family. The house was on fire, and Thorley, his wife, their two daughters, two boarders, and one guest were able to get out of the house to safety. The seven attempted to get down the front stairs, but were repelled by the flames. They escaped out the back instead.\nFrank Howard, the guest, had trouble finding a fire alarm box but eventually located one on the corner of Court Street and Village Avenue. By holding the lever down, instead of simply pulling it down and releasing it, he interfered with the sounding of the whistle that indicated the location of the fire. The correct location was noted inside the fire station, however.\nChief Henry J. Harrigan sounded a general alarm upon arriving on scene when he saw the Highland Street side of the building completely engulfed. The entire Dedham Fire Department battled the flames for five hours, but the snow and ice created additional challenges. They used nine fire hoses to spray water on the house. The fire, which was likely caused by a faulty furnace, gutted the interior of the home. Only the exterior walls were left standing and it was razed.\nLost in the fire were 50 oil paintings by Magdeline Thorley, George's wife, an accomplished painter. One was worth $1,500. All of the clothes and possessions of the Thorley family, their boarders, and their guest were lost. Deputy Chief John Hartnett and firefighter William Henderson entered the building and attempted to rescue the dog, but were unsuccessful and Josephine perished in the flames.\nThe Thorley's daughter, Barbara, taught a kindergarten in the building.\nPresent day\nIn 1950\u201351, the property was subdivided and three new homes were built on it. Four granite fence posts on Court Street are all the remain of the original building.\nNotes\n^ Bullfinch also designed the Haven house a few blocks away.\n^ Edward was vice president of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and died in 1865.\n^ The Library of Congress source has another name, which is illegible, printed in the original document. It is crossed out and Morse's name is handwritten next to it.\n^ Thorley was a member of the Dedham Board of Assessors.\n^ One guest was Billy Murray, the captain of the 1919 Harvard Crimson football team. At the time, Murray was the district supervisor of the National Youth Administration.\n^ More than $33,000 in 2024 dollars.\n",

McDevitt (January 15, 1916 \u2013 September 12, 1965) was an American politician who was Mayor of Reading, Pennsylvania from 1956 to 1960 and a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1961 to 1964.\nEarly life\nMcDevitt was born on January 15, 1916, to Thomas H. and Catherine (Heffelfinger) McDevitt. He served in the Infantry Branch of the United States Army during World War II and received two Bronze Star Medals and a Purple Heart. After the war, he operated the Reading House bar. When he became mayor, McDevitt transferred control of the bar to brother.\nPolitics\nIn 1953, McDevitt was elected to the Reading city council in his first ever attempt at elected office. Two years later, he ran for mayor of Reading. He defeated former mayor John F. Davis\tby a 2 to 1 in the Democratic primary and beat city clerk Ralph W. D. Levan 18,556 votes to 11,674 in the general election. During his tenure, the West Shore Bypass was constructed, municipal parking lots were expanded, and the city's sewer system was upgraded.\nAfter McDevitt took office, Abe Minker took control of the rackets in Reading. Casinos and houses of prostitution flourished in the city until federal intervention. On July 4, 1956, the Internal Revenue Service removed unlicensed gambling machines from the Reading House. Following the raid, McDevitt went to war with the Reading Eagle and Reading Times for publishing accounts of the incident. He closed the city hall press room, had police officers ticket newspaper delivery trucks every time they stopped to drop off papers, and had reporter Charles H. Kessler arrested for disorderly conduct for posing for a photograph in front of City Hall. The tickets were thrown out and the case against Kessler was dismissed. On September 7, 1957, United States Treasury agents raided the Reading House and arrested McDevitt's brother for tax violations related to an illegal horse book run at the bar. McDevitt was defeated for reelection by John C. Kubacki.\nMcDevitt was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1960 and reelected in 1962, but did not run for a third term in 1964.\nOn October 15, 1964, McDevitt and former city councilor Bruce R. Coleman were charged with extorting $2,000 from a company that sold three fire trucks to Reading in 1959. The district attorney's office dropped the case on March 22, 1965, following a successful habeas corpus petition by McDevitt, who acted as his own attorney.\nIn 1965, McDevitt ran for a seat on the Reading city council, but lost in the Democratic primary.\nDeath\nOn September 9, 1965, McDevitt suffered a heart attack and was admitted to Reading Hospital's intensive care unit in serious condition. He died three days later and was buried in Gethsemane Cemetery in Laureldale, Pennsylvania. He was survived by his wife, Isabelle (Shaner) McDevitt, and daughter.\n",
    "Species of gall wasp\nBelonocnema kinseyi is a species of gall wasp that forms galls on Quercus virginiana and Quercus fusiformis. There are both asexual and sexual generations. The asexual generation forms galls on the underside of leaves whereas the sexual generation form galls on the roots. It can be found in the United States, where it is known from Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. It, along with the other described Belonocnema species, have been used to study speciation.\nTaxonomy and Phylogenetics\nBelonocnema kinseyi was first named in 1921 by Lewis Hart Weld based on individuals raised from asexual leaf galls collected on Quercus fusiformis in Boerne, Texas. The specific epithet \"kinseyi\" honors prominent entomologist and sexologist Alfred Kinsey, who greatly contributed to knowledge of North American gall wasps.\nIn 1998, it was discovered that the asexual generation described from Texas induced sexual root galls, which at the time was believed to only be associated with Belonocnema treatae. Thus, B. kinseyi was placed as a junior synonym under B. treatae. It was subsequently re-elevated to species status through genetic and morphological analysis in 2021.\nGenetic data places Belonocnema kinseyi as an outgroup to a clade containing its sister species B. treatae and B. fossoria. Additionally, A 2022 study investigating the evolutionary relationships within the family Cynipidae used data from B. kinseyi, where it was placed in the phylogeny as sister to Druon quercuslanigerum.\nDescription\nThe asexual generation galls are smooth, unilocular balls that appear on the ventral side of leaves. Young galls are orange or light brown and darken as they age. The sexual generation galls are irregular shaped, multilocular clusters of galls appearing on small rootlets.\nBelonocnema kinseyi can be separated from B. fossoria by the spur on the anterior side of the fore tibia being shorter than the basitarsus and tibial spur in both sexual and asexual generations. It can also be told apart from B. treatae in the sexual generation by deeply delimited scutellar foveae separated narrowly by a carina, and its reddish brown color as well as indistinctive areolet in the asexual generation.\nDistribution\nBelonocnema kinseyi can be found in southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, a small area of Oklahoma and south, central and southeast Texas. This distribution follows that of their host trees, Quercus virginiana and Quercus fusiformis. However, a species turnover occurs in southeast Mississippi, where B. treatae replaces B. kinseyi for the remaining eastern range of Q. virginiana.\n",
    "Kingdom in Papua\nThe Kingdom of Sekar, formerly called the Kingdom of Kabituwar, is one of the nine kingdoms that still exist in West Papua Province. The other eight kingdoms are Ati-Ati, Patipi, Rumbati, Fatagar, Arguni, Wertuar, Namatota, and Komisi. This kingdom is located on the Onin Peninsula, Kokas district, Fakfak Regency, West Papua. In the early period, Sekar was a subordinate to the Kingdom of Rumbati, but later it was recognized as its own kingdom.\nHistory\nInitially, the Kingdom of Sekar was centered on the entrance of Sekar Bay, which was called Kabituwar. Therefore, the first king, Pandai alias Congan, held the title of King of Kabituwar. The Kokas area became a settlement for many traders from outside Papua, and later this settlement was named Sekar. In 1896, the Sultan of Tidore appointed a man from\u00a0soa Beraweri, Mner, as the Kapiten king of the Sekar. This appointment was based on the Misool and Rumbati kings' suggestions. Thus, the authority of the Kapiten King of Sekar was separate from the authority of the King of Kabituwar. Mner then moved to Sekar and founded the village of Sekar. Mner's eldest son, Kubis, also received the title of Kapiten King of Sekar, but subsequent descendants no longer received this title.\nMeanwhile, before assuming the title of King of Kabituwar, Pandai was an unofficial commissioned king from the Kingdom of Rumbati. His father Paduri alias Weker also held this title. However, when Pandai died, no potential successors were considered. This was because Pandai had no siblings, and his only son, Abdulrachman, was still a child. As a result, the government of the Kabituwar kingdom was led by the rajamuda of Wertuwar named Lakate, who was Pandai's stepson. Pandai was married twice. His second wife, Badika, was previously the wife of the rajamuda of Wertuwar, Inisuka, who was Lakate's father. Lakate assumed his role as the King of Kabituwar, while Saban Pipi Rumagesan carried out the role of the rajamuda, although he was not officially appointed. Pipi himself was the son of Dimin, the adopted \"golden child\" of Paduri. According to the local custom, Dimin's descendants could not become a king because they did not have a kinship relationship with the previous kings.\nIn 1911, the Dutch colonial authorities did not find a qualified person to replace Lakate, so they intervened in the succession of the Kabituwar kingdom by appointing Pipi as the king with the title of King Sekar. His daughter had previously been married to Lakate. Due to Pipi's old age, his son Machmud Singgirei Rumagesan was appointed as the rajamuda to assist in governance. Pikpik, originally part of the Atiati kingdom, was transferred to Sekar.\nAround 1885, the king of Atiati appointed a local chief in Pikpik, intending to gain war support amidst threats between Rumbati on one side and Atiati and Fatagar on the other. This local chief was named Tatare and was given the title of king, although this title was not recognized by the Dutch government until his son Kauat was acknowledged as the Pikpik chief. However, through the Dutch intervention, all relations between Atiati and Pikpik were abolished, and Pikpik was annexed to the Kingdom of Sekar. It can be assumed that Kauat made several maneuvers to establish his own kingdom without being under Sekar. However, the desires of the Pikpik local chiefs were never supported by the Dutch colonial government. Based on practical considerations, Pikpik was within the jurisdiction of Sekar, although traditionally, the position of the Sekar king as the head of Pikpik was still debated. Some other areas that did not acknowledge the authority of the Sekar king at that time were Sisir and Ugar, which had their own royal lineages. However, the Dutch colonial government fully supported the authority of the Sekar king.\nMachmud Singgirei Rumagesan was appointed as king in 1915 and was officially recognized by the Dutch government. However, King Rumagesan often rebelled against the Dutch. His rebellion was sparked by a conflict with Colijn Company, an oil mining company operating in Kokas. In the early period, King Rumagesan and the local residents facilitated the company's operations in Kokas, so the company agreed to give him part of the wages to distribute to the people. However, a local assistant administrator demanded King Rumagesan return the money to him, but King Rumagesan refused. This Assistant Administrator reported to the Controleur van den Terwijk, who then engaged in a fight with King Rumagesan. The local residents supported King Rumagesan and nearly killed van den Terwijk. The rebellion escalated, prompting the colonial government based in Fakfak to send troops. Eventually, 73 local residents and 5 village chiefs were arrested and sentenced to 2\u201310 years in prison. Meanwhile, King Rumagesan was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Saparua, Maluku. While in prison, Rumagesan wrote a letter seeking help from Muhammad Husni Thamrin, a member of the Volksraad. Thamr",
    "Species of lichen\nTeloschistopsis bonae-spei is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), fruticose lichen in the family Teloschistaceae. It occurs in South Africa, where it grows on maritime and coastal rocks.\nTaxonomy\nIt was first formally described as a new species in 1984 by the lichenologists Ove Almborn and Josef Poelt, who initially classified it in the genus Caloplaca. The type specimen of Teloschistopsis bonae-spei was collected in South Africa, specifically within the Cape Province on the Cape Peninsula, in the district of Simon's Town. The precise location was the Cape of Good Hope reserve at Olifantsbos on the west coast. Here, the lichen was found growing on sandstone banks, which rise up to 2 metres high, situated in the immediate coastal area. The collection was made from somewhat sheltered locations on more or less vertical surfaces.\nPatrik Fr\u00f6d\u00e9n and colleagues transferred the taxon to the genus Teloschistopsis in 2013, following a molecular phylogenetics-led reorganisation of the Teloschistaceae.\nDescription\nTeloschistopsis bonae-spei predominantly grows on rocks devoid of calcite. It forms expansive colonies characterised by both flat and three-dimensional structures. The thallus (body of the lichen) displays a range of yellow to yellow-orange coloured lobes, measuring up to 5\u00a0mm in length and between 0.3 and 1\u00a0mm in width. These lobes, found at the periphery, are tightly to loosely attached to the substrate, have irregular branching, and may overlap each other. On older parts of these marginal lobes, numerous pseudocyphellae (tiny, porous spots that facilitate gas exchange) are present. Moving towards the centre of the thallus, the lobes can be similar in adherence to the substrate or can rise up, forming a loose, shrub-like layer that stands over the crusty base of the thallus. These ascending lobes are variably flat to significantly compressed and range from 0.5 to 3\u00a0mm in width. In mature lobes, the cortex layer, which covers the surface, may crack longitudinally creating long strips filled with pseudocyphellae, mirroring the coloration of the marginal lobes.\nApothecia (fruiting bodies) are distributed sporadically and can be abundant on certain lobes. They are borne on the upper side or terminally on the lobes, and have flat to slightly convex, brownish-yellow-orange discs. Initially, these discs are encircled by a protruding thalline margin}, which soon transitions into a narrow proper margin and a more retracted, wart-divided thalline margin. The underside of these fruiting bodies is also covered with numerous pseudocyphellae.\nThe structure within these lobes is dorsiventral, meaning they have differentiated upper and lower surfaces. The upper side, barring the pseudocyphellae, is sealed with a continuous network of scleroplectenchymatic filaments (thick-walled, supportive tissue), while the underside is more irregularly structured. The medulla, or innermost layer of the thallus, in areas not occupied by filament networks, contains clusters of granular, colourless to ochre deposits.\nThe apothecium excipulum (supporting layer of the fruiting body) mirrors the irregular structure of the thallus, lacking a distinct amphithecium (outer layer of tissue around the apothecium). The hymenium (spore-producing layer) is about 70\u201380\u00a0\u00b5m high, with paraphyses (filamentous cells in the hymenium) that are 1.5\u20132\u00a0\u00b5m thick, expanding up to 5\u00a0\u00b5m at the capitate (club-like) terminal cells. Some paraphyses transform into oil paraphyses, usually containing one or two oil cells. The spores are narrow to broadly ellipsoid, measuring about 11.5\u201316\u00a0\u00b5m by 5.5\u20137.5\u00a0\u00b5m, with septa approximately 2.5\u20135\u00a0\u00b5m thick.\n",

    "\nJaime G\u00f3mez Rivas is a Spanish physicist and an academic. He is a professor at Eindhoven University of Technology.\nRivas is most known for his physics research, primarily focusing on nanophotonics and terahertz optics. His work has been published in academic journals, including Light: Science & Applications and Materials today. He holds multiple patents. Moreover, he is the recipient of 2016 Facebook Academy Award for his work on plasmonics.\nEducation\nRivas earned his Master's in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics from Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e9ge in 1995. Later, he completed his Ph.D. from the Universiteit van Amsterdam in 2002.\nCareer\nFrom 1997 to 2001, Rivas held a position as a research associate at Universiteit van Amsterdam to perform a PhD. Following this, between 2002 and 2005, he served as the project leader for THz Plasmonics as well as postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Semiconductor Technology at RWTH-Aachen University. There, his group pioneered the field of semiconductor THz plasmonics. From 2005 to 2015, he assumed the role of project leader (2005\u20132009) and group leader (2009\u20132015) for the Nanowire Photonics Group at the FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF) in Amsterdam. Between 2005 and 2015, he also led the Surface Photonics Group embedded at Philips Research in Eindhoven, where he introduced the concept of plasmonics and nanoantennas for solid-state lighting. Concurrently, he held a part-time professorship in surface photonics at Eindhoven University of Technology. Subsequently, he served as a full professor of surface photonics and THz physics at the same institution from 2016 to 2019. Since September 2019, he has held the positions of full professor and group leader of the Surface Photonics Group, as well as the capacity group leader of the Photonics and Semiconductor Nanophysics group at Eindhoven University of Technology. He cofounded TeraNova in 2019.\nResearch\nRivas, in his early research focused on light propagation through strongly scattering media and Anderson localization of light. In his 1999 work, he explored the fundamental physics of light-matter interaction within disordered scattering materials, such as polydisperse semiconductor powders and porous layers.\nIn 2003, Rivas' research delved into the resonant tunneling of surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) through doped semiconductors at terahertz frequencies, revealing enhanced transmission through subwavelength apertures, showcasing sharp resonances and notably improved transmission efficacy over classical diffraction transmission.\nRivas' 2007 collaborative research with OL Muskens, JA Sanchez and others explored how resonant optical nanoantennas can significantly enhance the radiative decay rate of fluorescent dye molecules, resulting in improved internal quantum efficiency, as demonstrated through experimental observation and theoretical validation. His 2009 research explored the interplay between nanoengineered arrays of nanoparticles that support collective resonances, known as surface lattice resonances, and fluorescent molecules to manipulate light emission at the nanoscale.\nRivas' 2011 research presented an advancement in plasmonic nanoparticle sensor performance, achieving over tenfold improvement in sensitivity by exploiting diffractive coupling of localized surface plasmon resonances to create narrow linewidth Fano resonances for precise refractive index detection. While investigating the integration of high quantum efficiency emitters with plasmonic nanoantennas, his 2013 work demonstrated a substantial improvement in light emission from extended sources by achieving over 70-fold directional enhancement for p-polarized emission and 60-fold enhancement for unpolarized emission, paving the way for new research directions in solid-state lighting. In 2013, he delved into the utilization of metal nanoparticle arrays for strong light-matter coupling, exploring how molecular electronic transitions interact with electromagnetic fields to form hybrid light-matter states. This investigation led to the demonstration of polariton lasing and condensation at room temperature, and enhanced exciton propagation. His later work examined bound states in the continuum (optical modes without any loss) both in the visible and at THz frequencies.\nAwards and honors\n2011 \u2013 Starting Grant and Proof of Concept Grant, European Research Council\n2016 \u2013 Facebook Academy Award for Solid State Lighting, Facebook\n2016 \u2013 Excellent Publication Award, Light Science & Applications\nSelected articles\nMuskens, O.

    "Aerial warfare branch of China's Ground Force\nMilitary unit\nThe PLA Army Air Corps is the air arm of the People's Liberation Army's Ground Force. Its principal mission is to provide close air support, air assault, transportation, and overall air assistance to the land forces of the PLA. It deploys primordially rotary wing aircraft.\nHistory\nThe PLA Army Aviation Corps was established on October 3, 1986, by decision of the Central Military Commission, at the time under the leadership of its chairman Deng Xiaoping, as part of an effort to modernize the organization of the PLA. The Corps started operating in 1987. On January 8, 1988, the first army aviation unit was established in the Beijing Military Region.\nThe initial units of the army aviation corps used equipment transferred from the PLAAF, including mostly the first Chinese-made helicopter, the Harbin Z-5 (a version of the Mil Mi-4), the licensed-made Z-8 (a version of the French A\u00e9rospatiale SA 321 Super Frelon) and the American-made S-70C \"Black Hawk\" purchased during the Sino-American thaw of the 1980s. The success of the American attack helicopters during the Gulf War impressed the Chinese military command, which put more emphasis on the development of indigenous helicopters. This accelerated program would lead to the introduction in 1994 of the Harbin Z-9 (developed from the French Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin), the Harbin Z-19 (an armed variant of the Z-9, introduced in 2012), the medium attack Changhe Z-10 (introduced in 2012), and the medium utility helicopter Harbin Z-20 (generally based on the Black Hawk in configuration, introduced in 2019).\nThe progress of the local helicopter industry, however, was slow. The difficulty providing relief after the Wenchuan Earthquake of 2008 brought into clear relief the shortage of helicopters in China, both civilian and military, in particular helicopters capable of operating at high altitudes. The need for more helicopters became apparent and the procurement of military rotary wing aircraft accelerated. While the native Z-19 and Z-10 were already available, the Chinese government tried to accelerate the equipment of full brigades by purchasing a large number of Mil Mi-17 helicopters in 2019, a sign of its desire to accelerate the development of army aviation.\nOrganization\nBy 2013, the army aviation regiments in six military regions were ungraded to brigades. After the 2015 military reforms, the military regions were merged into theaters and each group army within each theater was intended to have an independent Army Aviation brigade.\nAs of 2023, each of the 13 PLAGF group armies, plus the Tibet and Xinjiang special military regions, had an aviation brigade, for a total of 13 army aviation brigades and 2 air assault brigades.\nEach army aviation brigade is composed of 2-3 attack helicopter battalions, and 3-4 transport and assault helicopter battalions, for a total of 32 to 48 attack helicopters and 48 to 64 transport helicopters. The estimated current number of available aircraft runs between 1,000 and 1,500, depending on the source.\nThe current army aviation units are as follows, the brigade number being usually the same as the group army's number.\nEastern Theater Command\n71st Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 71st Group Army)\n72nd Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 72nd Group Army)\n73rd Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 73rd Group Army)\nSouthern Theater Command\n74th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 74th Group Army)\n121st Air Assault Brigade (attached to the 75th Group Army)\nNorthern Theater Command\n78th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 78th Group Army)\n79th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 79th Group Army)\n80th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 80th Group Army)\nCentral Theater Command\n81st Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 81st Group Army\n82nd Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 82nd Group Army)\n161st Air Assault Brigade (attached to the 83rd Group Army)\nWestern Theater Command\n76th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 76th Group Army\n77th Army Aviation Brigade (attached to the 77th Group Army\nThe 84th Army Aviation Brigade in the Xinjiang Military Region.\nThe 85th Army Aviation Brigade in the Tibet Military Region.\nThe Beijing Garrison, plus the Macao and Hong Kong Garrisons, are the only major regional subdivisions of the PLA without an attached army aviation brigade (although smaller helicopter units are available).\nEquipment\nFurther information: List of active People's Liberation Army aircraft\n",

He became a Food Science Consultant in 1990 and was the first PhD graduate of the University of Maine Food and Nutrition Sciences Department in 1992.\nCareer\nRiaz began his academic career by running the extrusion program at Texas A&M University in 1992. He later joined the Faculty of the Institute of Food Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University in 1995 and became a Graduate Faculty in 1998. He has been the Holder of the Professorship in Food Diversity in the Food Science and Technology Department since 2017.\nFrom 2005 to 2020, and has been the Head of the Extrusion Technology Program and the Research Scientist of the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station since 1997 and the Associate Department Head since 2022. He served on various committees while at Texas A&M, most recently serving on the Department Head Search Committee, and the New Faculty Search Committee.\nResearch\nRiaz has contributed to the field of food science by studying halal food, extrusion processing of food and feed, oilseed processing, snack food, pet food, vegetable protein processing, and religious and ethnic foods.\nWorks\nRiaz's works largely focus on halal food, extrusion, and food processing. He co-edited the Handbook of Halal Food Production with Muhammad M. Chaudhry, which covered the aspects of halal food production, guidelines, market dynamics, and certification requirements, addressing the growing global demand for Halal food. They also co-authored Halal Food Production providing information on food laws, regulations, production guidelines, and trade requirements for halal food. In a review for the Journal of Aquatic Food Product Technology, Keith W. Gates commented \"The authors present the first comprehensive reference detailing Halal food production and certification requirements... a rare mix in one volume, practicality down to the expert's minutia combined with a fascinating and enlightening explanation of the spiritual basis for Halal, the Arabic word for 'permitted' or 'lawful.'\"\nRiaz published Soy Application in Foods in 2006, exploring the diverse uses of soy ingredients in the food industry, looking into processing conditions and applications. Later, in Extruders in Food Applications and Extruders and Expanders in Pet Food, Aquatic and Livestock Feeds, he offered practical insights on the application of extrusion technology in the food industry, covering various extruder types and applications for pet food and feed. He also co-authored Extrusion Problems Solved: Food, Pet Food and Feed with Galen J. Rocky which was called \"an extremely informative book\" by Donald G. Mercer.\nHalal food production\nRiaz has researched halal food production throughout his career. In a collaborative research paper, he highlighted the lack of transparency in disclosing the sources and processing of food ingredients, urging consumers to advocate for clearer labeling in halal and kosher food production. He outlined halal food laws for Muslims, emphasizing religious significance and offering guidance to the food industry, including dietary prohibitions, slaughter methods, the global halal market, and certification.\nIn 2021, Riaz and colleagues examined the acceptability of stunning methods in Halal meat production, weighing their pros and cons for economic and ethical considerations among Muslims.\nExtrusion processing\nRiaz studied extrusion processing by analyzing its effects and usage. He explored the various definitions of extrusion, emphasizing its role as a continuous cooking process with expanding applications in food, feed, and oilseed industries. In a joint research, he looked into the impact of extrusion, particularly on fat and water-soluble vitamins, revealing factors affecting their rete",
    "Central Asia and nearby regions\nA depiction of Central Asia in dark-green along with some nearby associated regions in light-green.\nGreater Central Asia (GCA) is a variously defined region encompassing the area in and around Central Asia, by one definition including Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Xinjiang (in China), and Afghanistan, and by a more expansive definition, also including Mongolia and parts of India and Russia. The region was historically interconnected religiously, economically, and otherwise, being important as part of the Silk Road trading network until the 15th century; the competition between Soviet, British, and Chinese spheres of influence split the region apart in the 20th century. In the 21st century, it has been contested by a number of major powers, such as America, China and Russia.\nThe region is defined to a significant extent by its many tribal/clan alliances and histories.\nHistory\nAncient era\nIn ancient times, GCA was involved in the Silk Road, and was greatly influenced by Buddhism as it transmitted through the region to East Asia. The region was important in an intellectual sense, coming up with many new ideas and connecting the intellectual spheres of neighboring Eurasian regions. Alexander the Great's conquests throughout the region, culminating in northwest India, Hellenized the region and left Greek kingdoms such as the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in their wake. The Kushan Empire was one of the first empires to unite most of GCA.\nThe Mongol conquest of Central Asia in the 13th century increased the economic connectivity of the region. The Islamization of GCA was ongoing during this time period; Arab conquests of the region from the 7th century onward had surpassed the conquests of the region from the previous millennium in bringing cultural and religious change, with the southern regions of GCA having converted to Islam within the first Islamic century, while the northern parts of Central Asia took closer to a millenium; Central Asia then went on to be a core contributor to the Islamic Golden Age. However, non-Muslim areas of GCA such as Mongolia still share common religious heritage with neighboring areas through elements such as Tengrism. Central Asian conquests of India in the first half of the second millennium, primarily by Timur and later Babur, then resulted in the spread of a Turco-Persian tradition throughout GCA and through northwestern South Asia into the rest of South Asia. By the 17th century, the importance of the Silk Road had declined due to the rise of maritime trade.\nModern era\nA depiction of Britain (the lion) and Russia (the bear) contesting Afghanistan (Sher Ali Khan).\nThe 18th to mid 20th-century British rule of India disconnected South Asians from their centuries-long ties to GCA at the same time that the Soviet Union and Chinese Qing dynasty were conquering parts of the region. Afghanistan became a buffer state between the British Empire and the Soviet Union in what was referred to as the \"Great Game\". After India's independence in 1947, it was able to build closer ties with Soviet Central Asia as part of its overall close relations with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, in contrast to Pakistan.\nImportant events in the early 2020s, such as America's chaotic pullout from Afghanistan, along with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, have reduced Central Asia's chances of creating land routes to the sea for trade, and have created fears in the region of being invaded again.\nChina's involvement in GCA, involving over $100 billion in investment, is argued to be aimed towards the protection of its Xinjiang region from neighboring terrorist groups, as well as securing natural resources and curbing the local influence of America and India. India is interested in engaging with GCA, though its difficult relationship with Pakistan and the instability of Afghanistan reduce the potential for such engagement for the time being. India also lacks the direct borders with Central Asia as well as the economic heft of being able to provide a Belt and Road Initiative-type project to the region that China has, which are factors that favor China's influence in the region.\nSee also\nSoviet Central Asia\nInner Asia\nGreater Iran\nGreater Khorasan\nGreater Middle East\n",

    "New Zealand public servant (1923\u20132000)\nRex John Willing (25 March 1923 \u2013 23 September 2000) was a New Zealand public servant and politician who was the private secretary to Prime Minister Norman Kirk.\nBiography\nEarly life and career\nWilling was born in 1923 to Thomas Elwin and Alice Mona Willing. In 1947 he married Marie Frisk and lived together in Elsdon, north of Wellington. He worked in the public service successively for the Department of Statistics, Department of Industries and Commerce and Consumers Institute.\nPolitical career\nIn 1966, Willing became assistant secretary to Norman Kirk, who was then the Leader of the Opposition. He worked under Malcolm McNamara, who was Kirk's private secretary. At the time the Leader of the Opposition had no research office, so Willing started a makeshift one with Margaret Hayward that served the entire parliamentary caucus and a personal research system for Kirk. A formal research office was later established in 1971. McNamara was a different personality to Kirk as an academic and active Christian, both traits which Kirk mistrusted. Willing was more working class and the two got along well personally. When McNamara tendered his resignation (which he assumed would not be accepted) Kirk made no hesitation in promoting Willing to replace him.\nAt the 1968 local-body elections, Willing was elected a member of the Porirua City Council on the Labour Party ticket. He served as a councillor until 1974 when he did not seek re-election.\nIn the 1969 election, Willing and Margaret Hayward served as speech writers for Kirk and ensured he had a more consistent policy message than previous elections which contributed to a rise in support. During the 1972 election campaign Willing went through the National Party's estimates of Labour's election pledges and found them to be exaggerated, with inflated figures in National's costing estimates. This became an attack line against National in Labour's campaign. Unsure if he would retain a job working for Kirk after Labour won the 1972 election (staff for the parliamentary opposition were employed by the Legislative Department not the Labour Party), Willing planned to transfer to the Department of Trade & Industry. However Kirk made arrangements to have him employed in the office of the Prime Minister. He later shared an office with Hayward at the beehive from 1972 to 1974. He travelled with Kirk on the road when he attended events and conferences, taping speeches and then typing up transcripts of them for publication. This included accompanying Kirk on his overseas trip to Asia and Australia in December 1973 and January 1974. Whilst in Singapore He and Kirk went swimming in a luxury swimming pool at the Shangri-La Hotel where he almost drowned and had to be rescued by Kirk. He worked close enough with Kirk to notice the strained relations he had with his wife Ruth, particularly after the 1972 election.\nWhen Kirk died in 1974, the finance minister Bill Rowling replaced him as prime minister. Rowling reorganised the prime minister's office staff and did not retain Willing as personal secretary. For the next month Willing was kept on however to assist Ruth Kirk with her affairs and correspondence. He then shifted to work as a private secretary for Hugh Watt, the Minister of Works and Development, until 1975. Willing stood for election to the New Zealand House of Representatives for the Labour Party in the Manawatu seat of Ruahine at the 1975 election finishing runner-up. After the election, he gained employment at the Department of Statistics.\nIn 1976, he made a return to local-body politics when he won a by-election for the Porirua City Council to replace Gary McCormick who had resigned. In 1977 he stood for Mayor of Porirua as well as the city council as an independent candidate. He was unsuccessful in both elections. For standing as an independent against the official Labour ticket he was expelled from the party. In 1980 he was elected for a third spell as a Porirua City Councillor. Once on the council again, he voted in favour of a motion to refer the controversial appointment of former Lower Hutt deputy mayor John Seddon as Porirua's Town Clerk to the Office of the Ombudsman. After one term, he was defeated when standing for re-election in 1983. For six years he was also a member of the Porirua Licensing Trust (1977\u201380, 1983\u201386).\nLater life and death\nHis wife, Marie, died in 1992 and Willing moved from Elsdon to T\u012btahi Bay in 1994. He died at Kenepuru Hospital on 23 September 2000, aged 77. He was survived by his three sons and one daughter.\nCitations\n^ a b c d \"Former city councillor dies\".

    "Species of spider\nEuophrys leipoldti or the Karoo Euophrys Jumping Spider is a species of jumping spider in the genus Euophrys that is endemic to South Africa. It lives in karoo and succulent karoo. The female was first described in 1903 by George and Elizabeth Peckham and the male in 2014 by Wanda Weso\u0142owska, Galina Azarkina and Anthony Russell-Smith. It is a small spider, with a body that consists of an oval cephalothorax that measures between 1.9 and 2.1\u00a0mm (0.07 and 0.08\u00a0in) long and a narrower abdomen that is between 1.8 and 2.4\u00a0mm (0.07 and 0.09\u00a0in) long. The female has a larger abdomen than the male. The spider is generally yellowish-brown to brown, although some examples have a darker topside of the cephalothorax, or carapace. The spider has a mottled pattern on its abdomen. The male has slightly longer brown front legs, the remainder being yellow. The female has yellowish-brown legs that have brown patches and rings. Its copulatory organs are distinctive. The female has the longest insemination ducts in the genus and the male has an unusual spiral embolus.\nTaxonomy\nEuophrys leipoldti is a species of jumping spider that was first described by George W. Peckham & Elizabeth G. Peckham in 1903. They allocated it to the genus Euophrys, which had been first circumscribed by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1834. The genus is named for a Greek word that can be translated \"fair eyebrows\". The species is named for Christiaan Friedrich Leipodt who found the first examples. It is known as the Karoo Euophrys Jumping Spider. Initially, the only examples to be described were female, a description of the male having to wait for more a century until it was completed by Wanda Weso\u0142owska, Galina Azarkina and Anthony Russell-Smith in 2014.\nIn Wayne Maddison's 2015 study of spider phylogenetic classification, the genus Euophrys was listed to the tribe Euophryini. First circumscribed by Simon in 1901, the tribe has also been known as Euophrydinae, but the original name is now more prevalent. It is a member of a subgroup of genera called Evophrydeae after the latter name. It is a member of the clade Saltafresia. Analysis of protein-coding genes showed it was particularly related to Thorelliola. In 2016, Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski added the genus to a group of genera named Euopherines, named after the genus. This is a member of the supergroup of genera Euphryoida.\nDescription\nEuophrys leipoldti is a small spider with a body divided into two main parts: a larger cephalothorax and a smaller abdomen. The male has an oval cephalothorax that is typically 2.1\u00a0mm (0.08\u00a0in) long and 1.6\u00a0mm (0.06\u00a0in) wide. The carapace, the hard upper part of the cephalothorax, is yellowish-brown to brown and covered in white hairs. The spider's eye field is dark brown or black and covered in brown hairs. There is a thin line of white hairs that run down the middle, crossed with a thicker line. The underside of the cephalothorax, or sternum, is brownish-yellow. The spider's face, or clypeus, is also yellowish-brown with a scattering of white scales visible on its surface. The chelicerae are stour and brown, again with small white scales, and have two teeth to the front and one to the back.\nThe male's abdomen is slightly smaller than its carapace, being typically 1.8\u00a0mm (0.07\u00a0in) long and typically 1.3\u00a0mm (0.05\u00a0in) wide. The top has a mottled pattern of dense brown and white hairs marked with a pattern of darker spots that form a streak across the middle, which itself breaks into a succession of chevrons near the back. The underside is light brown. The spider has brownish spinnerets and book lung covers. The front legs are longer than the rest and generally brown, apart from patches of yellow, and covered in brown hairs. The remaining legs are yellow and marked with brown rings.\nThe female is has a slightly smaller cephalothorax than the male, typically 1.9\u00a0mm (0.07\u00a0in) in length and 1.5\u00a0mm (0.06\u00a0in) in width, and an abdomen that is larger, between 2.4\u00a0mm (0.09\u00a0in) long and 1.8\u00a0mm (0.07\u00a0in) wide. It has a dark carapace with a pattern of white bands on the edges that extend into the eye field. Some examples have a brown carapace with a darker eye field, covered in dense shiny hairs, and a yellowish-brown sternum. The chelicerae are also yellowish-brown, and have a dense covering of white hairs. The abdomen is yellowish and covered in white and brown hairs. The pattern is different to the male but similarly mottled, and consists of small patches. All the legs are yellowish-brown with brown patches and rings. It has a large number of long brown leg spines. In some examples, the legs are covered in white hairs.\nThe spider has distinctive copulatory organs.\nThe female epigyne has two round depressions near the front and two copulatory openings that are partially hidden by small flaps. These lead via very long and looping insemination ducts to bean-shaped spermathecae. The male has brown pedipalps and a yellow cymbium, covered in brown hairs. Brown hairs also cover the palpal tibia",

    "Mauritanian-American mathematician\nToka Diagana (also published as Tocka Diagana) is a Mauritanian-American mathematician, a professor of mathematics and chair of mathematics at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the editor-in-chief of the journal Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems. The topics of his research include functional analysis, stochastic processes, differential equations, dynamical systems, and operator theory.\nEducation and career\nDiagana is originally from Ka\u00e9di, in southern Mauritania, a country in Northwest Africa. After attending a top high school in Ka\u00e9di, he went north to Tunisia for undergraduate studies at the Facult\u00e9 des sciences de Tunis\u00a0 of Tunis El Manar University. There, his interests in mathematical analysis and topology were sparked by Abdenabi Achour and Said Zarati. At the suggestion of Achour, he traveled to France for doctoral study in mathematics, at Claude Bernard University Lyon 1. He earned a diploma of advanced studies (master's degree) there in 1995, and completed his Ph.D. in 1999, under the direction of Jean-Bernard Baillon, also working in Lyon with \u00c9tienne Ghys.\nAfter a brief stint as a secondary school teacher in Thoissey, France, Diagana came to Howard University in the US as a lecturer in 2000, and obtained an assistant professorship there in 2002. He was quickly promoted to associate professor in 2004, and then to full professor in 2007. He moved to his present position as professor and chair at the University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2018.\nContributions\nDiagana founded the African Diaspora Journal of Mathematics, and is the editor-in-chief of the journal Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems.\nHis 13 authored and edited books include both mathematical monographs and multiple compilations of mathematics from researchers of the African diaspora.\nDespite many academic publications, in a profile on Mathematically Gifted & Black, he describes his greatest accomplishment as his mentorship of eight African Americans to doctorates in mathematics, including two women, countering the historic underrepresentation of people from these groups in mathematics.\nRecognition\nDiagana is a 2006 recipient of the Prix Chinguitt, a Mauritanian national prize given annually for excellence in science research. He is a Fellow of the African Academy of Sciences, elected in 2009.\n",
    "Palestinian-French jurist, activist and politician\nRima Hassan (Arabic: \u0631\u064a\u0645\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646) is a French-Palestinian jurist, human rights activist and politician born on April 28, 1992, in the Palestinian refugee camp of Neirab, near Aleppo, Syria.\nStateless, she arrived in France around the age of nine and settled with her family in Niort. After obtaining French nationality upon reaching adulthood, she earned a master's degree in international law from Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne University. \nHassan then founded, in 2019, the 'Refugee Camps Observatory', an NGO dedicated to the study and protection of refugee camps worldwide. In 2023, she founded the 'Action Palestine France' collective. That same year, she joined La France Insoumise in preparation for the 2024 European parliament election.\nFamily and origins\nRima Hassan Mobarak was born on April 28, 1992, in the Neirab camp, near Aleppo, Syria.\nShe is the youngest of six children. Her mother, Nabiha (1958-2021), was a teacher, while her father is a former mechanic in the Syrian Air Force named Ahmad. Her father's parents, Palestinians originally from the village of Al-Birwa, were forced into exile to Syria during the creation of Israel in May 1948, during the Nakba.\nHer maternal grandmother, on the other hand, came from a prominent Syrian family, the Hananu. She married a Palestinian refugee from Salfit. Because of her notable status and his being a Palestinian communist refugee, she chose to forsake her heritage and settle with him in the camp.\nYouth and studies\nDue to the unhappy marriage and an abusive relationship between her parents, her mother left the camp shortly after her birth and managed to immigrate to France, where she reunited with one of her sisters. She then spent eight years attempting to regain custody of her children and transfer them to France.\nShe ultimately managed to do it and Rima Hassan arrived in France around the age of nine. She settled in Niort, in the Deux-S\u00e8vres region, with her mother, sister and four brothers. She was elected to the children's municipal council in 2003, in Niort. She studied there at Ernest P\u00e9rochon Primary School. During this time, her mother did not work as a teacher, her original profession, but instead worked in restaurants to support her family. Hassan was targeted by hate speech during her schooling, including being called ethnic slurs like 'bougnoule' (wog) by her classmates. This led to a progressive loss of her native language, Arabic. She obtained a scientific baccalaureate from La Venise Verte High School in 2011.\nStateless until her adulthood, she obtained French nationality in 2010. As soon as she reached the age of majority, she sought to travel to Palestine via Tel Aviv, intending to \"finally discover the land of her ancestors\", but she was prevented from boarding at Charles de Gaulle Airport.\nAfter these events, she pursued studies in law and obtained her bachelor's degree. For this, she spent two years at the University of \u00c9vry, then one year at the University of Montpellier, until 2014. She spent a year in Lebanon and completed her master's degree in 2016 at Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne University (Paris 1). She focused on the legal comparison between South Africa and Israel in a master's thesis in international law on the issue of apartheid.\nAccording to her, obtaining her degree from Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne was a source of great pride for her mother because the university's reputation would have been known even in the Neirab camp.\nWork\nRima Hassan joined the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) in 2016, and after 18 months, she worked at the National Court of Asylum Law for six years until 2023. In 2019, she founded the NGO 'Refugee Camps Observatory'. The following year, Hassan participated in a roundtable organized by Emmaus for the World Refugee Day, on June 20th.\nIn 2022, the Interministerial Delegation for Reception and Integration dedicated a portrait to her as an \"Inspirational Woman\". That same year, she revisited the notion of \"fraternity\" from the French national motto in a podcast, along with other participants.\nOn February 3, 2023, she spoke at the French Senate for the symposium \"Israel-Palestine: State of Affairs\" organized by Paris Senator Esther Benbassa, in collaboration with L'Histoire and the French Research Center in Jerusalem. Her intervention addressed the issue of apartheid in Israeli society.\nFollowing the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, amid the bombing of the Gaza Strip and the ground offensive launched by Israel, she terminated her contract with the National Court of Asylum Law and declined an advocacy position on migration issues offered by Amnesty International. Instead, she moved to the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Nayrab, near Aleppo, \"to be close to her people\" and established the Action Palestine France collective on Telegram.\nUntil November 2023, she also advised L'Or\u00e9al on diversity and refugee integration issues.\nPolitical actions\nIn August 2023, ",

Caroline Aaron and Henry Winkler have supporting roles. It centers on Chanshi (Chanowitz), a young American Jewish woman that decided to leave her community behind and make aliyah to Israel. It began airing on the HOT network in 2022 and received 15 Ophir Award nominations.\nPlot summary\nChanshi (Chanowitz), a young ultra-orthodox Jewish woman from Brooklyn has recently gotten engaged to Mendy (Gvirtsman). However, she surprises everyone, including her family by deciding to make aliyah to Israel before the wedding.

    "\nLocal elections will be held in most cities and municipalities in Serbia (excluding the disputed territory of Kosovo) on 2 June 2024. \nInitially, the Serbian government planned to hold a local election only for the City Assembly of Belgrade on 2 June, with the other local elections taking place later in the year. The Belgrade vote was required due to the city assembly's failure to constitute itself after the 2023 Belgrade City Assembly election, while the other elections were scheduled to take place in accordance with Serbia's regular local electoral cycle. Ana Brnabi\u0107, the president of the national assembly, contended that holding all local elections on 2 June would require a change in Serbia's law on local elections and would unfairly restrict the mandate of those elected in the last regular local election cycle in 2020. Following extended controversy, however, the law was amended on 23 April and local elections were announced for various cities and municipalities on 26 April.\nSerbia's governing Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its allies will be participating fully in the elections. The opposition parties are divided on their strategy. Among the parties of the Serbia Against Violence (SPN) coalition, the Party of Freedom and Justice (SSP), Serbia Centre (SRCE), and Together (Zajedno) have announced a boycott in most jurisdictions, stating that no adequate guarantees have been provided that the elections will be free and fair and that there is insufficient time for the situation to change. \nAs against this, the People's Movement of Serbia (NPS), the Green\u2013Left Front (ZLF), the Movement of Free Citizens (PSG), Ecological Uprising (EU), and the New Face of Serbia (NLS) have indicated will participate in the vote. Although the Democratic Party (DS) voted in favour of a boycott, it also decided to adopt the position of the majority of the opposition parties, and on that basis it will be participating in the election as well. Outside the SPN coalition, the parties of the National Democratic Alliance (NADA) alliance will be boycotting the elections in most jurisdictions. Other opposition parties, including Dveri, will be participating.\nOn 26 April 2024, SSP leader Dragan \u0110ilas said that although his party would be boycotting the election in most jurisdictions, it would not discourage Serbian citizens from voting.\nWith the exception of Belgrade, the cities and municipalities of Serbia that held off-year local elections in 2021, 2022, and 2023 will not be participating in the 2024 vote.\nAll local elections in Serbia are held under proportional representation. Mayors are not directly elected but are instead chosen by elected members of the local assemblies. The electoral threshold for assembly representation is three per cent (of all votes, not only of valid votes), although parties representing national minority communities are exempt from this requirement.\n",
    "\nShmiras Halashon (guarding the tongue) is a practice in Judaism that is said to promote the quality of life and help combat and reduce Lashon Hara (evil tongue). It is a part of Jewish ethics commonly known as mussar. King David once said, \"He who loves life and would like to see good days, let him guard his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.\" King Solomon goes on to say, \"Whoever guards his mouth and tongue guards himself from trouble.\"\nThough the concepts and practice of Shmiras Halashon is found all through ancient Jewish writings, the modern practice was birthed and popularised by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan who is well known as Chofetz Chaim.\nHistory and folklore\nThe first sin according to Torah is the serpent speaking evil about God and not practicing Shmiras Halashon which led to Eve being deceived bringing death.\nJoseph spoke negatively to his father, Jacob, about his brothers, causing them to hate him. This led to their selling him, and ultimately caused the Egyptian exile.\nThe difficult slavery in Egypt is attributed to talebearers amongst the people and not guarding their tongue.\nThe slander of Doeg, King Saul\u2019s chief shepherd and the head of the Sanhedrin, caused the massacre of nearly an entire city.\nThe armies of King Saul lost their battles with the Philistines as a result of the slander that people spoke against (then future) King David.\nThe armies of the notorious king Ahab were successful in their battles, despite the fact that they were idolatrous, because they guarded their tongue.\nThe destruction of the Second Temple is attributed to not being careful about Shmiras Halashon. The redemption and peace of the people is connected to being careful about Shmiras Halashon.\nTorah Commandments\nShmiras Halashon is divided into 31 Torah commandments which need to be observed.\n17 things not to do (negative commandments)\n14 things to do (positive commandments)\n4 curses that you get yourself out of (curses)\nKeeping these commandments are said to increase one's happiness and quality of life and being careless in this area is said to cause destruction.\nNegative commandments\nYou shall not go as a slanderer among your people; nor shall you stand against the blood of your neighbor; I am the Lord. (Vayikra 19:16)\nYou shall not raise a false report (Shemot 23:1)\nTake heed concerning the plague of leprosy. Leprosy came as a punishment for Lashon Hara. (Devarim 24:8)\nYou shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shall fear your G-d; I am the Lord. This is when you cause another one to sin as when you engage in evil talk. (Vayikra 19:14)\nPositive commandments\nRemember what the Lord your G-d did to Miriam by the way, after you came out of Egypt\u201d. We are commanded to remember that Hashem punished Miriam for speaking against Moshe. (Devarim 24:9)\nAnd you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the Lord\u201d. When you love someone you don't talk evil about anyone. (Vayikra 19:18)\nYou shall do no unrighteousness in judgment...but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor. This verse exhorts us to give the benefit of the doubt when judging our fellowmen. (Vayikra 19:15)\nAnd if your brother has become poor, and his means fail with you; then you shall relieve him; though he may be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you. If you say something and as a consequence someone is hurt financially you transgress this command. (Vayikra 25:35)\nCurses\nCursed be the one who hits his friend in secret. Anyone who does not watch his mouth does just this, he hits his friend behind his back, in secret.  (Devarim 27:24)\nCursed be the one who confounds the blind on the road. By making others  transgress the commandments of Shmiras Halashon you make them sin. (Devarim 27:18)\nCursed be the one who will not establish the words of this Torah in order to do them. If a person habitually does not bother about God's commandments, he is the habit of repeating the transgression of constantly. (Devarim 27:26)\nCursed be the one who hits his father or his mother. This forbids the speaking ill about one's father or mother. (Devarim 27:16)\nModern application\nThe concept of guarding one's tongue works in a family or corporate setting and is proven to increase peace and happiness.\n",

    "Pakistani lunar nanosatellite\nICUBE-Q or ICUBE-QAMAR (Urdu: \u0622\u0626\u06cc \u06a9\u06cc\u0648\u0628-\u0642\u0645\u0631) is a Pakistani lunar remote sensing observation nanosatellite and is one of the four international payloads of the Chang'e 6 lunar sample-return mission. It is a joint venture between the Institute of Space Technology (IST), Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and the Intelligent Satellite Technology Center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under the framework of Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO). It is the first deep space mission of Pakistan.\nOverview\nIn 2019, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced an opportunities for payloads in its upcoming lunar sample-return mission of Chang'e 6, the space agency had a slot for payloads weighing less than 10\u00a0kg in its orbiting spacecraft. The CNSA has announced in 2022 that it will carry scientific instruments from France, Italy and Sweden on the Chang'e-6 mission's lander along with a Pakistani payload on the orbiter. Pakistan's Institute of Space Technology (IST) had answered the call with a proposal for a lunar CubeSat named \"ICUBE-Qamar\" (ICUBE-Q) and it was selected after a rigorous evaluation. The design and development of ICUBE-Q was a collaborative effort between Institute of Space Technology (IST), Pakistan's national space agency SUPARCO, and China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). IST has been developing several CubeSat in the same series of which iCube-1 was successfully launched in 2013.\nThe Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Aeronautics and Astronautics developed the satellite in its Intelligent Satellite Technology Center. The satellite called by them as \"SJTU Siyuan 2\" had to integrate multiple functions within limited space and mass, including energy supply, communication systems and the scientific experiment equipment. To overcome the gravitational disturbances, strong radiation expostures, temperature fluctuations and threat of lunar dust, the spacecraft was incorporated with multi-sensor fusion technology, multi-layer shielding and advanced thermal control technology to ensure its stable operation. SJTU had previously launched its first student satellite APSCO-SSS-2A (SJTU Siyuan 1) in collaboration with IST in October 2021.\nDescription\nTT&C Antennas and Subsystems\nThe overall project consists of three main parts: the satellite itself, the separation mechanism (which includes the power control box) and the mounting bracket. The on-orbit fault diagnosis algorithm enables the satellite to automatically detect and diagnose possible system faults. The spacecraft also features intelligent task scheduling strategy.\nDesign Life: 3 months (planned).\nMass: The entire satellite weighs only 6.5\u00a0kg (14\u00a0lb) and the total carrying weight reaches 9.0\u00a0kg (19.8\u00a0lb).\nCommunication: X band for TT&C and image data transfer at a data rate of 1 kbit/s.\nPower: 12\u00a0V, 11.6\u00a0Ah Battery (139.2 watts) with two deployable solar panels.\nAttitude Control: Three axis control using reaction wheels, star sensor and Sun sensors.\nTemperature Control: Thermal management systems\nPayload: 2 Visible light cameras of one mega pixel resolution (1280 \u00d7 720) mounted on opposite (+/-) X panels.\nBuilt Material: Incorporates advanced materials such as special magnesium alloy and honeycomb carbon fiber.\nMission summary\nICUBE-Q was integrated with Chang'e 6 orbiter after successful qualification tests at SUPARCO and SJTU. On 3 May 2024 the satellite was launched on Long March 5 Y8 rocket from Wenchang Space Launch Site.\nThe satellite was deployed from the Chang'e 6 lunar orbiter stack in at 08:14 UTC, (13:14 PKT) on 8 May 2024 and will undergo testing for the first few days with the first images being expected around 15-16 May 2024.\nThe mission objectives include obtaining detailed images of the lunar surface and conducting intelligent on-orbit data processing of images, obtaining lunar magnetic field data and establish lunar magnetic field model and verifying new technologies such as nanosatellite-level deep space lunar-ground communications and low-cost deep space exploration  based on micro-nano satellites.\nThe satellite transmitted its first images back to Earth on 11 May 2024 captured from a distance of 200 kilometres from the Moon.\nNotes\n^ Although called a \"CubeSat\", it does not follow the CubeSat form factor.\n",

    "\nShmiras Halashon (guarding the tongue) is a practice in Judaism that is said to promote the quality of life and help combat and reduce Lashon Hara (evil tongue). It is a part of Jewish ethics commonly known as mussar. King David once said, \"He who loves life and would like to see good days, let him guard his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.\" King Solomon goes on to say, \"Whoever guards his mouth and tongue guards himself from trouble.\"\nThough the concepts and practice of Shmiras Halashon is found all through ancient Jewish writings, the modern practice was birthed and popularised by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan who is well known as Chofetz Chaim.\nHistory and folklore\nThe first sin according to Torah is the serpent speaking evil about God and not practicing Shmiras Halashon which led to Eve being deceived bringing death.\nJoseph spoke negatively to his father, Jacob, about his brothers, causing them to hate him. This led to their selling him, and ultimately caused the Egyptian exile.\nThe difficult slavery in Egypt is attributed to talebearers amongst the people and not guarding their tongue.\nThe slander of Doeg, King Saul\u2019s chief shepherd and the head of the Sanhedrin, caused the massacre of nearly an entire city.\nThe armies of King Saul lost their battles with the Philistines as a result of the slander that people spoke against (then future) King David.\nThe armies of the notorious king Ahab were successful in their battles, despite the fact that they were idolatrous, because they guarded their tongue.\nThe destruction of the Second Temple is attributed to not being careful about Shmiras Halashon. The redemption and peace of the people is connected to being careful about Shmiras Halashon.\nTorah Commandments\nShmiras Halashon is divided into 31 Torah commandments which need to be observed.\n17 things not to do (negative commandments)\n14 things to do (positive commandments)\n4 curses that you get yourself out of (curses)\nKeeping these commandments are said to increase one's happiness and quality of life and being careless in this area is said to cause destruction.\nNegative commandments\nYou shall not go as a slanderer among your people; nor shall you stand against the blood of your neighbor; I am the Lord. (Vayikra 19:16)\nYou shall not raise a false report (Shemot 23:1)\nTake heed concerning the plague of leprosy. Leprosy came as a punishment for Lashon Hara. (Devarim 24:8)\nYou shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shall fear your G-d; I am the Lord. This is when you cause another one to sin as when you engage in evil talk. (Vayikra 19:14)\nPositive commandments\nRemember what the Lord your G-d did to Miriam by the way, after you came out of Egypt\u201d. We are commanded to remember that Hashem punished Miriam for speaking against Moshe. (Devarim 24:9)\nAnd you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the Lord\u201d. When you love someone you don't talk evil about anyone. (Vayikra 19:18)\nYou shall do no unrighteousness in judgment...but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor. This verse exhorts us to give the benefit of the doubt when judging our fellowmen. (Vayikra 19:15)\nAnd if your brother has become poor, and his means fail with you; then you shall relieve him; though he may be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you. If you say something and as a consequence someone is hurt financially you transgress this command. (Vayikra 25:35)\nCurses\nCursed be the one who hits his friend in secret. Anyone who does not watch his mouth does just this, he hits his friend behind his back, in secret.  (Devarim 27:24)\nCursed be the one who confounds the blind on the road. By making others  transgress the commandments of Shmiras Halashon you make them sin. (Devarim 27:18)\nCursed be the one who will not establish the words of this Torah in order to do them. If a person habitually does not bother about God's commandments, he is the habit of repeating the transgression of constantly. (Devarim 27:26)\nCursed be the one who hits his father or his mother. This forbids the speaking ill about one's father or mother. (Devarim 27:16)\nModern application\nThe concept of guarding one's tongue works in a family or corporate setting and is proven to increase peace and happiness.\n",
    "Constituency in Busan, South Korea\nSasang (Korean:\u00a0\uc0ac\uc0c1\uad6c) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of Sasang District, Busan. As of 2024, 181,823 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 2000 after the consolidation of the Sasang A and Sasang B constituencies.\nHistory\nSasang, like the majority of constituencies located in the Busan\u2013Gyeongnam Area is widely considered a stronghold for the conservative People Power Party. Accordingly, the constituency has consistently elected members of conservative political parties and allied independents, with the only exception being in 2012 when Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic United Party was elected.\nKwon Chul-hyun of the conservative Grand National Party was the first member to represent the constituency. He won re-election in 2004, but was \"cut-off\" from being re-nominated in 2008. He was succeeded by Chang Je-won, the son of former Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of South Korea Chang S\u014fng-man. Chang did not run for re-election in 2012 due to a bribery scandal, and the Saenuri Party nominated Son Su-jo as the party's candidate for Sasang. Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic United Party defeated Son in the general election, marking the only time a member of a centre-left, liberal party won in the constituency. Moon led an unsuccessful presidential campaign in the 2012 South Korean presidential election and remained as the member of the National Assembly for Sasang. Moon did not run for re-election and was succeeded by the constituency's former member Chang Je-won. Chang, who ran as an independent candidate, garnered 37.5% of the vote and narrowly beat out Democratic opponent Bae Jae-jung in a three-way race. Chang won re-election in 2020 with 52.03% of the vote, once again defeating Bae Jae-jung of the Democratic Party. Ahead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, Chang announced that he would not stand for re-election. The People Power Party nominated Kim Dae-sik, who went on to win the general election; Bae Jae-jung marked her third consecutive loss in Sasang.\nBoundaries\nThe constituency encompasses the entirety of Sasang District, Busan.

    "The history of publishing newspapers in Sunnm\u00f8re, a region in M\u00f8re og Romsdal, Norway, stretches from 1808, and is continuous to the present day. The overarching newspaper in the region is Sunnm\u00f8rsposten, with a plethora of newspapers covering specific municipalities of the region.\n\u00d8rsta and Volda\nMain article: M\u00f8re (newspaper)\n\u00d8rsta and Volda were hubs for intellectual life in Western Norway. Sivert Aarflot started Landbobladet in 1808, which was the first rural newspaper in Norway. Published in Volda, Landbobladet changed its name to Postbudet in 1845 and M\u00f8ringen in 1869, then M\u00f8re.\n\u00c5lesund\n\u00c5lesund, then spelt Aalesund, emerged as the leading city in Sunnm\u00f8re. A cooperation between the bookseller J. Aarflot and the printer T. Zernichow led to the trade newspaper Aalesunds Handels og S\u00f8fartstidende being started in 1856. For a number of years it was called Aalesunds Tidende, reverting to the old name in 1876. Aalesunds Handels og S\u00f8fartstidende succumbed following the \u00c5lesund fire of 1904.\nAalesunds Blad started in 1871 with a more \"free-minded\" outlook. It ceased publication in 1911, having been overtaken by S\u00f8ndm\u00f8rsposten. This newspaper had its trial issue on 30 November 1882 and aligned itself with the Liberal Party. S\u00f8ndm\u00f8rsposten, which later modernised its name to  Sunnm\u00f8rsposten, firmly established itself during Ivar Flem's long service as editor-in-chief, starting in 1984 and spanning nearly fifty years.\nThe temperance movement founded Totalavholdsbudet in 1883, succeeded by S\u00f8ndm\u00f8re Folkeblad in 1892. It ceased in 1917, whereas Klaus Sletten tried to establish a successor M\u00f8re Tidend which lasted until 1920. At the same time, the Conservative Party managed to start Aalesunds Avis in 1917. The first editor-in-chief was Gerhard Jynge.\nLabour press\nArbeideneres blad nameplate\nArbeidernes Blad was \u00c5lesund's first newspaper aligned with the labour movement, lasting from January to April 1898. While intending to uphold a non-partisan labourer-friendly editorial style, it soon became more cleary socialist. The editorial team was a four-member committee consisting of Bernhard Riise (chief editor), Erik Pettersen, J. Langseth and Andreas Barstad. The owner of the printing press were pressured by loan providers to waive the printing of the newspaper. Arbeidernes Blad was briefly continued by M\u00f8ringen.\nThe \u00c5lesund city fire of 1904 led to an influx of labourers to rebuild the city. Petter Moe-Johansen seized the opportunity to become the first editor of Nybrott, which was subsequently edited by Johan Falkberget. Nybrott went defunct in 1907 and was succeeded by Aalesunds Socialdemokrat, which lasted until 1910. The next attempt at publishing Socialisten in 1915 became even more short-lived.\nIn 1921, the new Social Democratic Labour Party managed to found M\u00f8re Socialdemokrat. Three years after the Social Democratic Labour Party was incorporated into the Labour Party, the \"Socialdemokrat\" moniker was dropped in 1930 and the title was changed to Sunnm\u00f8re Arbeideravis.\nBefore the Labour\u2013Social Democratic Labour merger, M\u00f8re Arbeiderblad was started on 13 September 1923 as a newspaper with an unofficial affiliation with the Labour Party. Before the affiliation was made formal, the Communist Party broke away from Labour and took M\u00f8re Arbeiderblad with them. It henceforth served as the Communist Party organ for Sunnm\u00f8re. Well-known editors include \u00c5lesund native Reinert Torgeirson from 1924 to 1925 and Jens Galaaen from 1925 to 1929. The newspaper came once a week, except a period from early 1924 to mid-1929 when it came twice a week. It went defunct after its last issue on 28 March 1931, and though M\u00f8re Arbeiderblad did resurface later, the details around that are little known to historians.\nOutskirts of \u00c5lesund\nIn Sula south of \u00c5lesund, Sulaposten was founded in 1946. It was edited and printed in Langev\u00e5g, but has to find another printing press, and was also defunct between December 1967 and November 1974. Sulaposten gained traction during the campaign to demerge Sula from \u00c5lesund Municipality, which happened in 1977, and managed to survive as a weekly newspaper. The founder Ansgar Slagnes operated on more or less a hobby basis, with slim profits and contributors working without compensation. Shareholders were brought in from 1979, but Slagsnes returned as editor-in-chief from 1983 to 1989, resigning at age 84. Sulaposten was bought by a small consortium Sunnm\u00f8rsavisene AS in 1997, then V\u00e5rt Land before it was bought by Haramsnytt (see below) in 2008. Having surpassed the 2,000 mark with a cirulation of 2,413 in the year 2000, it dropped to 1,988 in 2020.\nIn Haram north of \u00c5lesund, there were three unsuccessful attempts to establish local newspapers. First, Bygdebladet existed from 1931 to 1932. M\u00f8re Bygdeblad lasted from 1932 until the German occupation of Norway in 1940 cracked down on the press. The third attempt, Vestland, became short-lived too, lasting from 1952 to 1953. As the population grew, Haramsnytt",
    "Species of plant in the family Sapindaceae\nCupaniopsis foveolata, commonly known as narrow-leaved tuckeroo, white tamarind or\ntoothed tuckeroo, is a plant in the maple and lychee family Sapindaceae found in eastern Queensland and New South Wales, Australia.\nDescription\nCupaniopsis foveolata is a tree growing to about 25\u00a0m (82\u00a0ft) high and 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) diameter. New growth is covered in fine hairs and twigs have numerous lenticels. The compound leaves can grow to about 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) long (including the petiole), with 4\u20138 or 10 leaflets arranged alternately. The leaflets are narrowly elliptic to ovate, obtuse at the base and bluntly accuminate at the tip. They measure up to about 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in) long and 2.5\u00a0cm (0.98\u00a0in) wide with scalloped margins.\nThe inflorescences are panicles produced either terminally, from the leaf axils or directly from the old wood of the branches. They are held erect and measure about 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) wide and long. They carry numerous cream-coloured flowers of about 6\u00a0mm (0.24\u00a0in) diameter held on pedicels up to 4\u00a0mm (0.16\u00a0in) long. The calyx is five-lobed, there are five sessile, hairy petals about 2\u00a0mm (0.08\u00a0in) long, and there are eight stamens. The ovary is 3-locular with one ovule per locule, the stigma is persitant.\nThe fruit is a yellow/orange 3-segmented capsule up to 25\u00a0mm (0.98\u00a0in) wide, broadest at the apex (i.e. the furthest point from the attachment to the branch). It is glabrous outside and finely hairy on the inner surfaces. Each segment contains a single black ellipsoid seed that is mostly enclosed within a yellow aril.\nPhenology\nFlowering occurs from May to September, and fruit appear from December to January.\nTaxonomy\nThis species was first described as Cupania foveolata by the German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. His description was based on material collected near the Macleay River in New South Wales, and also from Rockingham Bay in Queensland, and it was published in his book Fragmenta phytographi\u00e6 Australi\u00e6 in 1875.

His grandfather was Yi Chae (\uc774\uc7ac; \u674e\u6fdf\u7e21). His family background belonged to the Noron political faction. His art name was Hwach'\u014fn and his courtesy name was Kyeryang.\nIn 1774, Yi Ch'ae would pass the literary licentiate examination, and in the following year, he would be appointed to his first government post of assistant caretaker of the Hwiry\u014fngj\u014fn (\ud718\ub839\uc804\ucc38\ubd09; \u5fbd\u5be7\u6bbf\u53c3\u5949; Hwiry\u014fngj\u014fn ch'ambong). He would then go on to serve various positions, such as assistant section chief of the Ministry of Taxation (\ud638\uc870\uc88c\ub791; \u6236\u66f9\u4f50\u90de; hojo chwarang), an inspector from the Office of the Inspector-General (\uc0ac\ud5cc\ubd80 \uac10\ucc30; \u53f8\u61b2\u5e9c \u76e3\u5bdf; sah\u014fnbu kamch'al), section chief of the Ministry of Taxation (\ud638\uc870\uc815\ub791; \u6236\u66f9\u4f50\u90de; hojo ch\u014fngnang), and recorder of the Royal House Administration (\ub3c8\ub155\ubd80 \uc8fc\ubd80; \u6566\u5be7\u5e9c \u4e3b\u7c3f; tonny\u014fngbu chubu). By 1780, he was the magistrate of Eumjuk-hyeon. Due to false allegations against him, he was dismissed from his government post.\nIn 1790, he was able to serve the government once more, being appointed as the magistrate of Jirye-hyeon (in modern-day Gimcheon). When he arrived at Jirye, the flooded Gamcheon river\u00a0 had just damaged the local area. Yi built a dyke to prevent further flooding and to aid the local farmers. In 1800, when King Sunjo ascended to the throne, he was appointed as a guard (\uc704\uc194; \u885b\u7387; wisol) in the Standby Guard for Heir Apparent (\uc138\uc790\uc775\uc704\uc0ac; \u4e16\u5b50\u7fca\u885b\u53f8; seja ikwisa).

Yi Ch'ae died in 1820, and was buried in Chungju. He was given the posthumous name, Mungy\u014fng. In 1886, his great-grandson, Yi Ho-ik (\uc774\ud638\uc775; \u674e\u93ac\u7ffc) would publish his great-grandfather's collected works in the Hwach'\u014fnjib.\n",
    "Russian revolutionary (1830-1919)\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is  Aleksandrovna and the family name is  Subbotina.\nSofya Aleksandrovna Subbotina (n\u00e9e\u00a0Iovskaya; Russian: \u0421\u043e\u0444\u044c\u044f \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0443\u0431\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430; 1830\u20131919) was a Russian Narodnik revolutionary. The mother of Evgeniia, Maria and Nadezhda Subbotina, she went with her daughters to Zurich, where she joined a number of revolutionary circles. When she returned to Russia, she aided the return of fellow revolutionaries Varvara Batyushkova\u00a0 and Evgeniia Zavadskaya\u00a0, for which she was given up to the Tsarist authorities. She was charged in the Trial of the 193 and sentenced to exile, which she spent in the regions of the Volga, Urals and Siberia, her sentence extended after she was caught financially supporting other political exiles as a member of Narodnaya Volya. Upon her return from exile, she travelled through European Russia, Poland and Ukraine, where she was kept under close surveillance. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, she returned to her home in Oryol, where she died in 1919.\nBiography\nSofya Aleksandrovna Iovskaya was born in 1830, in Moscow, the daughter of Aleksandr Iovsky, a professor at the Imperial Moscow University. She grew up and was educated in Moscow. In 1852, she married a landowner, Dmitry Pavlovich Subbotin, with whom she lived on an estate in the village of Podvorgolskoye, in the Oryol province. Sofya herself also owned land in the village of Belomestnoye. Together they had three daughters: Evgeniia, Maria and Nadezhda Subbotina.\nDmitry died shortly after Nadezhda's birth, leaving his children with a considerable inheritance. Sofya endeavoured to provide them with the best possible education, enrolling them at a girls' school in Moscow in 1868. She went abroad with Nadezhda in 1873, settling in Switzerland, where Evgeniia and Maria were attending the University of Zurich. In Zurich, Sofya associated with other Russian emigres, joined a women's circle and attended meetings of the International Workingmen's Association (IWA), before returning to Russia later that year.\nShe invited revolutionary women, who were living in hiding, to teach at schools where she was a trustee. She brought Varvara Batyushkova\u00a0 to Podvorgolskoye and Evgeniia Zavadskaya\u00a0 to Belomestnoye, where they carried out revolutionary propaganda work among the peasantry. She was denounced to the police by a local official and, on 14 September 1874, she was arrested in Belomestnoye and transferred to a prison in Kursk. When the police searched her property over the subsequent days, they found a lot of revolutionary literature. She was then transferred to Saint Petersburg, where she was held in pre-trial detention in the Peter and Paul Fortress. On 5 May 1877, she was finally charged for anti-Tsarist propaganda in the Trial of the 193. As she refused to answer the court's questions, she was removed from the courtroom and kept out while the trial continued for months. On 23 January 1878, she was found guilty of \"uttering hateful words\" and sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. The court approved this sentence on 11 May 1878, under the condition that she remain under police surveillance for three years afterwards.\nOn 19 July 1878, the Minister of Internal Affairs Alexander Timashev ordered that she be deported to the Vyatka Governorate, where she was to be kept under strict surveillance. On 21 November 1878, Timashev's successor Lev Makov\u00a0 granted her permission to move to Kainsk, in the Tomsk Governorate, so she could live with her daughter Nadezhda. She arrived there in March 1879, and in July 1880, she and her daughter moved to Tomsk, where they joined a group that assisted political exiles. In December 1881, she was named on a list of members of Narodnaya Volya; her house was searched, where the authorities found that she had provided money to political exiles. She was arrested on 1 January 1882 and detained until 26 March. She was briefly released before being detained again on 22 July 1882. On 5 October 1883, she was deported to the Yeniseysk Governorate in Siberia for a period of five years, under police surveillance. In 1886, her sentence was extended for two more years. She lived in Minusinsk for the remainder of her exile. She requested to be temporarily allowed to return to Moscow in November 1886, and to move back to Tomsk in March 1887, but her appeals were rejected.\nIn August 1888, her exile ended and she returned to Oryol, where she was kept under surveillance. She moved to Warsaw in 1891, then to Moscow in 1893, and then to Kyiv in 1897. By 1902, she had settled permanently in Odesa, where she would live for many of the last years of her life, and where she remained under police surveillance. After the February Revolution, in April 1917, she returned to Oryol, where she died on 15 February 1919.\n",
    "Medieval stronghold\nVishegrad (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434) is a medieval fortress in the Rhodope Mountains of southern Bulgaria rising over a promontory in the valley of the river Arda. About one kilometer south on another hill lie the ruins of an ancient Thracian fort. Its name means High Town.\nLocation\nRuins of Vishegrad\nVishegrad is located on a 306\u00a0m height rising on the right bank of the river Arda over the modern Studen Kladenets Reservoir. It lies in Kardzhali Province just north of the village of Vishegrad and 2\u00a0km east from the town of Kardzhali. From Vishegrad there is an excellent visibility towards the larger Monyak Fortress (587\u00a0m) on the left bank of the Arda some 4.5\u00a0km to the east, as well as to the fortress of the medieval Monastery of John the Precursor 2.5\u00a0km to the west. Both Vishegrad and Monyak and were likely constructed to the protect the region around the mouth of the river Varbitsa, which was part of the secondary road between the major cities of Philippopolis and Adrianople. The Thracian fortress is situated on the 369\u00a0m elevation of Harman Kaya a kilometer south. The two fortresses and the village are located on a curved slightly elevated line connected by natural saddles with a gentle slope to the river.\nThracian fortress\nThe Thracian fortress on Harman Kaya had its origins in period between the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (1200\u20131100 BC), as evidenced by the earliest dated artifacts found during excavations. It is assumed that the fortress continued to function throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages during the First and Second Bulgarian Empires.\nFrom the east, south and west it is only accessible through a few places. The northern side is protected by a wall which has an arched shape, widened at the western end. The fortress walls and its interior were cleared during excavations that were carried out in 1971\u20131974. The walls are approximately 2\u00a0m thick and preserved to a height of 1\u00a0m. The masonry is made of rough stones, joined with mud mortar, and in some places the joints are filled with small pebbles and earth. The entrance to the fortress is located at the easternmost end and is about 2\u00a0m wide. In several places in the interior, dugout floors and furnace foundations were found. During the excavations fragments of clay vessels, iron implements and weapons were discovered.\nMedieval fortress\nSection of the medieval wall\nThe medieval Vishgrad Fortress originated from the 4th century AD but all preserved structures date from the Middle Ages. It has common features with the material culture of old Bulgarian cities of the First and Second Empires, such as Pliska, Preslav, Tarnovo, Messembria, etc. The relatively well-preserved citadel was probably the residence of the governor of the medieval region of Achridos. Along with the nearby fortifications of the Monastery of John the Precursor and the adjacent medieval settlement that existed in the 9th\u201314th century, Vishegrad is considered to be the progenitor of the modern town of Kardzhali. The fortress was destroyed in the aftermath the Bulgarian\u2013Ottoman wars in the 14th century.\nThe fortification is small, occupying an area of 560\u00a0m2. The southern wall is 75\u00a0m long, 1.75\u00a0m wide at the top and is preserved to a height of up to 7\u00a0m. The fortress has two rectangular inner towers. One is at the eastern end of the structure. Its dimensions are 9.1x7.5\u00a0m, and its walls are 2.3\u00a0m thick. Later, a load-bearing wall was built through the middle of the room on the ground floor of the tower, which adjoined the southern wall of the tower with a well-defined joint. The walls are plastered with mortar mixed with broken brick. The ground floor was probably used as a water reservoir. The second tower is located in the middle of the south wall. There was probably a postern next to it. Its dimensions are 6.2x5.5\u00a0m, and the walls are 2.2\u00a0m thick. In the western half of the northern wall, an external stone staircase has been preserved, which served as an access the second floor of the tower, as the first one was used as a reservoir.\nAt a distance of 5\u00a0m from the southern wall, there is a second parallel wall, forming a 51\u00a0m long premise, which in later times was divided by transverse walls of broken stones joined with mud. Despite the impenetrable rock massif from the northern side of the hill, a defensive wall was built there as well, with which the fortress was enclosed by walls on all sides. That is the most deteriorated part of the stronghold. The main entrance is from the southeast and was initially 2.5\u00a0m wide, later narrowed by a wall to 1.2\u00a0m.\nGallery\nPanoramic view\nRuins of Vishegrad\nRuins of Vishegrad\nRuins of Vishegrad\nCitations\n^ a b c d e \"Vishegrad\".

    "War Hero of Afghanistan's Independence\nGhazi Mir Zaman Khan, who became known as Loy Khan Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan Kunari was a Royal Afghan Army General and War Hero of the Afghan War of Independence who fought for Pashtun freedom against the British Empire. He is regarded as a National Hero in Afghanistan.\nEarly life\nMir Zaman was born the son of Haji Gulroz Khan in 1869 in Lamattak village, Kunar Province of Afghanistan. His great-grandfather was Mohammad Akram Khan who left the Tirah Valley due to tribal conflict and settled in Kunar.\nPolitics and military career\nFrom a young age Mir Zaman felt a strong hostility towards the British Raj and its encroachment on the Pashtunistan area. This drew him closer to the tribal leaders of the North-West Frontier of British India leading him to join them in the Sra Ghaza (Red Jihad) of 1908 during the Bazar Valley and Mohmand Expedition.\nDue to his frequent activity in crossing the Durand line when fighting the British, Emir Habibullah detained him out of suspicion till the King himself had died in February of 1919, and Mir Zaman was released. He caught the attention of Amanullah Khan as a courageous anti-British fighter, he built up a strong influence around the tribes of Kunar and had a close relationship with the Amir, whose mother considered him as her own \"adopted son\".\nAnglo-Afghan War of 1919\nIn 1919, Afghanistan declared a holy war against British India and the call was answered by over 100,000 Afghans from both sides of the Durand. Mir Zaman fought in the Chatral front in the areas of Asmar and Arnawai where he led the tribes to victory over the British.\nHe was decorated with various medals after the war by the government of Ghazi Amanullah Khan, he became a member of the government council or Shura-i-Daylat and participated in the first Loya Jirgah of post-independence Afghanistan in 1921 at Jalalabad.\nAfghan rebellions\nMir Zaman Khan stayed loyal to Amanullah Khan and partook in operations against the Khost revolt of the Khostwal tribes and the Shinwari rebellion. \nHe remained loyal to Amanullah Khan through his reforms and modernisation, his second-eldest son Esmatullah Khan fought with him in the Afghan Civil War of 1928. Mir Zaman Khan and his Kunari tribals were sent to Jalalabad by the King Amanullah Khan to put down the rebellion and they were successful in holding their positions against multiple waves of major assaults of a large number of rebels.\nMartyrdom in the Civil War\nIn February of 1929, the Commander of the Royal Afghan force in Jalalabad, Sard\u0101r Ali Ahmad Khan rebelled and proclaimed himself King of Afghanistan. Mir Zaman then left on a campaign for Kunar Province to gather support to attack the forces of Habibull\u0101h Kalak\u0101ni. He was assassinated while in his prayers at a mosque in Kunar. \nIn early 1929, Amanullah Khan abdicated the throne as the Emir of Afghanistan. The son of the late Mir Zaman Khan, Esmatullah Khan joined Amanullah Khan to Kandahar and accompanied him, taking part in small clashes of the King's accompanying army till Quetta, Baluchistan. Esmatullah Khan was taken into custody at Peshawar and offered a large amount of land and property in exchange for his Zamani family to abandon their Anti-British stance, they warned him of an unhopeful future in post-Amanullah Afghanistan but he rejected the offer and was secretly guided back to Afghanistan by Mohmand tribesmen.\nA Pashto poem lavishing praise on Mir Zaman Khan:\n\u062e\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0633\u062a\u0627 \u067e\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0645 \u06a9\u0693\u064a \u0641\u062e\u0631 \u062a\u0647 \u064a\u06d0 \u0641\u062e\u0631 \u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646\u0648\n\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0633\u062a\u0627 \u064a\u0627\u062f\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0633\u062a\u0627\u064a\u064a \u062a\u0647 \u064a\u06d0 \u0641\u062e\u0631 \u062f \u0681\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646\u0648 \nLordship prides itself on you, you are the pride of lordship\nHistory savors your memories, you are the pride of the young\n",
    "Series of monographs by Aristotle's students or by Aristotle himself\nConstitutions (Ancient Greek: \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1\u03b9), or Politeiai, was a series of monographs written under the inspiration of Aristotle by his students or by Aristotle himself in the second half of the 4th century BCE. Each of the 158 parts described the history and political system of one of the Greek poleis. The only nearly completely preserved constitution is the Constitution of the Athenians.\nInventory\nThe cycle comprised 158 descriptions of Greek poleis. This information is provided by Diogenes Laertius and Hesychius of Miletus. Later commentators (Ammonius and Elias, 6th century) gave numbers like 250 or 255 works, but this could have resulted from including works by imitators in addition to the actual Politeiai, as concluded for the first time by the commentator on Aristotle in the 6th century, Simplicius, and also from Aristotle's descriptions of the Customary Laws of Barbarians. Another explanation for this number is a transmission error \u2013 the rounded number 150 could have been changed to 250. Another, less credible number is 171, reported by Ibn Abi Usaybi'a.\nThe content of individual works can be inferred primarily from preserved fragments. The most reliable group of Constitutions are those described in the preserved citations as Politeia written by Aristotle. These are the systems of the following poleis: Athens, Acarnania, Akragas, Ambracia, Argos, Arcadia, Achaea, Bottiaea, Cyprus, Delphi, Delos, Aegina, Elis, Epirus, Phocis, Gela, Himera, Ithaca, Keos, Cumae, Cius, Cythnus, Colophon, Corcyra, Corinth, Cyme, Cyrene, Sparta, Leukas, Locri Epizefiri, Miletus, Naxos, Naples, Opus, Orchomenus, Paros, Pellene, Samos, Samothrace, Sicyon, Syracuse, Taranto, Tegea, Tenedos, Thessaly.\nAnother group of poleis is presented in fragments where Aristotle's authorship is indicated, but without specifying a particular political system: Antandrus, Adramyttium, Chalcedon, Chalcis, Epidaurus, Crete, Crotone, Cythera, Meols, Miletus, Rhegion, Rhodes, Soloi, Sybaris, Thebes, Tenos.\nDue to the preparation of the Politeia as material for the Politics, it is highly probable to expand the obtained collection with cities appearing in this work: Abydos, Amphipolis, Antissa, Apollonia Illyria, Apollonia Pontica, Aphytis, Byzantium, Chios, Eretria, Pharsalos, Phocis, Hestiaea, Heraea, Heraclea Pontica, Histria, Catania, Clazomenae, Knidos, Kos, Larissa, Leontini, Magnesia, Mantineia, Mitylene, Thira, Thurii, Zancle.\nThe last group of potential political systems can be created from Heracleides' list \u2013 probably an author unknown from other activities (presumably from the 4th/5th century AD), sometimes identified as Aristotle's disciple Heracleides of Pontus or Heraclides Lembus, who lived in the 2nd century BC. Probably his source was only the Constitutions and the Customary Laws of Barbarians; after excluding the latter, the list of described poleis would also include Amorgos, Argilos, Ephesus, Icaria, Cephalonia, Lepreum, Minos, and Thespiae. In total, 44 poleis were included in the list.\nThe individual poleis were arranged alphabetically in the collection and numbered. The first was the Athenian politeia, and the politeia of Ithaca was numbered 42. Based on descriptions in Alexandrian catalogs, Heinrich Nissen proposed the thesis that the collection could have been divided into four parts corresponding to democracy, oligarchy, tyranny, and aristocracy. However, such a division would contradict the alphabetical order, would be very unbalanced, and would cause problems with classifying changing political systems.\nAuthorship and time of creation\nAristotle mentioned the collection of Constitutions in the Nicomachean Ethics (10.1181B17). It was supposed to be material gathered for his work on Politics. However, after the Athenian politeia was discovered, historians noted a later dating of the monographs (in the 320s BC) compared to the Politics (after 336 BC, most likely before 331 BC). Therefore, it was concluded from the analysis of the Constitution itself that the material was initially collected in the 330s BC, while its compilation occurred after Aristotle finished his work on Politics.\nThe only clue allowing for dating other than the Athenian politeia (besides Aristotle's lifetime) is the mention of gold coins in the Political Constitution of Cyrene, which were introduced around 340 BC. Due to the condition of the fragments, the authorship of the Athenian politeia was primarily considered. Historians agree that it is unlikely that Aristotle wrote all 158 politeia without the involvement of his students.\nArguments supporting the joint authorship of the politeia are provided by John Keaney. According to him, the schematic form of the works facilitated the author's quick creation of new politeia, which were probably shorter than the Athenian one. Additional facilitation could have been dictating the works, indicated by certain \u2013 characteristic for Aristotle \u2013 phras",

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 58, based on five reviews.\nKris Needs of Classic Rock praised the album, saying \"it's on those spiritual slowies that this crew rakes the biggest steps to creating the 21st-century southern masterpiece they are obviously capable of\". Lee Zimmerman of PopMatters also gave it a positive review, saying \"JJ Grey and Mofro provide a connection to the past and a time when talent and tenacity moved the music forward. Hallelujah for Ol' Glory. It's a prime example of what genuine Americana ought to emulate\".\nIn mixed reviews, AllMusic's Thom Jurek wondered: \"too many other tracks have one too many verses, could have used bridges, or been left off altogether. Ol' Glory may reveal a bigger, more multi-dimensional sound for Grey and Mofro, but at what price progress?\". Hal Horowitz of American Songwriter concluded: \"Grey and his band's drive, energy and enthusiasm go a long way to selling this music but at nearly an hour the effect is diluted. Leaving a handful of the weakest cuts in the vaults and honing the best parts from some of the others would have resulted in a stronger outing\".

Initially involved in the anarchist movement, she carried out propaganda throughout Belarus and attempted to assassinate the governor of Katerynoslav province. She was caught and imprisoned for several years, over time becoming attracted to the principles of revolutionary socialism. Upon her release during the Russian Revolution of 1917, she joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR) and worked for it in Crimea, Moscow and Ufa. She was charged in the Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries, but managed to avoid a prison sentence after she agreed to join the Communist Party.

She was raised in a Belarusian Jewish family, which provided her with an education. At a young age, she became interested in the ideas of anarchism and socialism.\nIn the wake of the Russian Revolution of 1905, she joined an anarchist communist group, for which she carried out revolutionary propaganda in the Belarusian cities of Hrodna, Kobryn, Pruzhany and Bia\u0142ystok. After being arrested in 1907, she moved to Katerynoslav, where she became involved in anarchist terrorism.

There she became friends with the SR Fanny Kaplan, who would later attempt to assassinate Vladimir Lenin. The three lived together in a boarding house, which they shared with Lenin's brother Dmitry Ulyanov.\nIn September 1918, she went to Moscow and joined the SR Combat Organization led by Grigory Ivanovich Semyonov. The following month, the party's central committee sent her to Ufa and she continued to work for the central committee until March 1919, when she began organising trade unions in Moscow, for which she was detained for over three months. In November 1919, she joined the central bureau of the PSR's minority faction, serving in the post until August 1920. She was arrested again in December 1921 and, on 24 February 1922, she was charged with anti-Soviet agitation by the GRU. During the Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries in August 1922, she was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was granted a release after she agreed to join the Russian Communist Party (RCP) and the Society of Former Political Prisoners and Exiled Settlers (MOPR), on the recommendation of Nikolai Bukharin, Georgy Pyatakov and Leonid Serebryakov.\nLater life and death\nIn September 1922, she returned to Crimea and settled in Simferopol, where she worked in the RCP's accounting department and as secretary for the local board of the MOPR. In January 1925, she went back to Moscow, where she worked as secretary for student affairs at Vkhutemas. In February 1926, she was appointed as secretary of Main Fuel Administration (Glavtop) and served in this post until January 1930. The following month, she started work as a factory inspector, which she carried out until April 1932. On 1 June 1932, the MOPR granted her a personal pension, but soon renounced it after she found another job in September 1933.

    "2024 diss track by Kendrick Lamar\n\"6:16 in LA\" is a diss track written and recorded by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, as the second response track to Canadian rapper Drake's single \"Push Ups\" and his independently released song \"Taylor Made Freestyle\". Like \"Taylor Made Freestyle\", the song was made exclusively available on Instagram, on May 3, 2024.\nThe song was produced by Sounwave and Jack Antonoff.

In similar fashion to the release of Drake's song \"Taylor Made Freestyle\", which was only available to listen to on his social media channels, Lamar posted the full song through an Instagram post on May 3. He had previously teased a second diss track on \"Euphoria\" by referencing Drake's Meek Mill diss track \"Back to Back\" (2015).\nThe song title \"6:16 in LA\" plays on the time-and-location-themed tracks that Drake has included on many of his projects, such as \"9AM in Dallas\" (2010), \"5AM in Toronto\" (2013)\", \"6PM in New York\" (2015), \"4PM in Calabasas\" (2016), \"7AM on Bridle Path\" (2021), and \"8AM in Charlotte\" (2023).\nA Maybach driving glove is used as the cover art of this song, a cropped portion of the image used for the cover of Lamar's next single and diss track, Meet the Grahams.

    "Political party in Poland\nThe Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras (Polish: Rolnicy od Ba\u0142tyku do Tatr, RBT) is a Polish electoral committee registered for the 2024 European Parliament election in Poland. It was founded on 18 April 2024 and was then registered on 24 April. Before being registered, it was called to correct irregularities that the National Electoral Commission found during the registration of the committee. Its founders are farmers from a small village of Wojciechowice in Opat\u00f3w County, in Eastern Poland. It is considered one of the agrarian electoral committees founded by farmers in wake of the 2024 Polish farmers' protests, which sparked Polish farmers' protests against the policies of the European Union. The demands of the protesting farmers include abolishing or reforming the European Green Deal, along with preventing the entrance of Ukrainian grain and sugar into Polish markets.\nIn its program, the electoral committee puts heavy emphasis on the development of hydroelectricity in Poland, believing that if developed, it could cover most of the Polish elecricity demand. It also proposes reforms that would make the European Union more supportive of agriculture and farmers. It postulates the implemention of waterway projects in Poland that would then be integrated into larger European waterway systems. The proposals of the Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras also include training for African farmers and an intership program that would enable them to undergo training on European farms, along with modernization of Polish healthcare system that would improve healthcare access in the Polish countryside. The committee believes that the post-1989 capitalist reforms in Poland failed the Polish countryside, resulting in rural poverty and lack of healthcare.\nBackground\nSince February 2024, Polish farmers have been organizing nationwide protests, with general demands being to abolish or reform the European Union regulations introduced by the European Green Deal, along with the implementiation of protectionist measures that would cease the import of Ukrainian grain and sugar into Polish markets. Protesting farmers argue that the prices of the agricultural products have become so low that farming is no longer a sustainable profession in Poland. Research from March 2024 found hat only 30% of Polish farmers earned a monthly income above the minimum wage. The poverty amongst Polish farmers has been steadily growing ever since the late 2000s, which was escalated by the 2011 law that force the purchase of leased land and indebtness of many farmers.\nThe situation in the Polish countryside was furned worsened and declined rapidly in 2018, as the 2018 drought affected more than 2.2 million hectares and caused losses of around 900 million PLN to Polish farms. Crop failure combined with the African swine fever virus render farming completely unprofitable in Poland, causing radical and anti-government sentiment in the countryside. In wake of this, many radical agrarian parties emerged in Poland, such as AGROunia and the Peasants' Party. These parties were inspired by the 1990s far-left Samoobrona movement, a radical rural trade union and a party that became known for its radical tactics, such as clashes with the police. Its willigness to assault police officers and debt collectors became an important factor in the radicalization of the Polish countryside.\nHistory\nThe Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras was founded on 18 April 2024 in a small village of Wojciechowice located in Eastern Poland. As of 2024, the village was home to around 300 people. The village was place of the 2024 Polish farmers' protests, and additionally there was a political protest in Wojciechowice in April 2024, as the mayor of the village was re-elected by a single vote in the 2024 Polish local elections. Because the margin of mayor's victory was one vote, the result of the election is to be decided by the court.\nOn 22 April 2024, the National Electoral Commission found irregularities in the registration process of the Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras, and requested a correction. The electoral committee was formally registered for the election two days later, on 24 April 2024. The electoral representative of the committee is Andrzej B\u0119ben, while the treasurer is Pawe\u0142 St\u0105porek. The leader of the party is Henryk Po\u0142cik, with the elecotoral representative of the RBT, Andrzej B\u0119ben, being one of the vice-chairmen.\nThe Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras is considered to be a part of the larger electoral action by Polish farmers sparked by the ongoing 2024 Polish farmers' protests, where Polish farmers protest against the policies of the European Union as well as the sharp decline of grain prices in Poland attributted to the presence of Ukrainian grain in Polish markets. However, the electoral committee of the Farmers from the Baltic to the Tatras is considered unlikely to gain any seats to the European Parliament, given the 5% elector",
    "\nAustralian rules footballer\nOscar Clavarino (born 22 May 1999) is an Australian rules footballer who played for St Kilda in the Australian Football League (AFL). Clavarino, a key defender, is noted for his intercept marking ability.\nDrafted as a second-round pick in 2017, Clavarino's AFL career was curtailed by slow development, ankle and hamstring injuries, and interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. He spent most of his time at St Kilda playing for their second-tier Victorian Football League (VFL) affiliate, Sandringham. In 2021, Clavarino finally made his AFL debut, 1283 days after he had been drafted. St Kilda delisted him at the season's conclusion; he continued his football with South Adelaide in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL).\nJunior career\nClavarino grew up in Melbourne's southeast. A Hawthorn supporter, he aspired to playing AFL \"since he  remember\". He played his junior football with Berwick, beginning as a tall utility comfortable playing forward or in defence. When Clavarino was nine years old, he played in an Auskick match on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nClavarino was educated at Haileybury, a member of the Associated Public Schools (APS) group, and was in the leadership group for the school's football team. He gained two mentors at Haileybury: Josh Battle, a good friend who was drafted by St Kilda a year before Clavarino and gave him advice on the time and diet management required of professional footballers; and Matthew Lloyd, the former Essendon forward, who was Clavarino's assistant coach from the age of 16.\nClavarino played in the TAC Cup for the Dandenong Stingrays. In 2017, his draft year, he captained the team, averaging 16 disposals and six marks per game.\nIn 2015, Clavarino represented Vic Country at the AFL under-16 national championships, held on the Gold Coast in July. He appeared at the 2016 under-18 national championships as a bottom-ager. On his return in 2017, he co-captained Vic Country alongside James Worpel and made the All-Australian side.\nIn August 2016, Clavarino was named among thirty prospective draftees for the following year in the AFL Academy's level-two intake. In December that year, he trained with Melbourne for two weeks as part of an Academy program to give prospective draftees insight into life at an AFL club.\nAhead of the 2017 national draft, it was unclear when Clavarino would be selected; media assessments placed him between a late first-round pick to an early third-round pick. He was considered the best intercept marker in his cohort and noted for his leadership.\nSenior career\n2017\u20132021: AFL career\nClavarino was drafted by St Kilda with pick 35 in the 2017 national draft. Clavarino was St Kilda's third selection; the club had already taken Hunter Clark and Nick Coffield with picks 7 and 8 and went on to choose Ben Paton with pick 46. St Kilda sent Clavarino's new teammate David Armitage around to his home to present him with a club guernsey.\nClavarino spent his early seasons with St Kilda developing his strength to AFL standards. Describing himself as a \"tall and skinny\" player in his reflections, Clavarino did not expect to play at AFL level for a few seasons. He named several mentors at St Kilda: among the staff, Aaron Hamill, the VFL coach; and Steve Forcone, the strength and conditioning coach. Among the players, he named defensive veterans Nathan Brown and Dylan Roberton.\nIn February 2019, Clavarino injured his ankle in a marking contest during an intra-club practice match. The injury sidelined him for eight weeks. This was a serious setback \u2013 Clavarino had been anticipated to make his AFL debut in the opening round of the season, since Brown was suspended and fellow key defender Jake Carlisle was recovering from an injured back. Clavarino ended up playing 14 VFL matches with Sandringham for the year, but did not play an AFL game. He signed a one-year contract extension in October; Simon Lethlean, the club's general manager of football, acknowledged Clavarino's position as a \"bigger-bodied defender\" meant he would take some time to develop as a player.\nClavarino's development was further interrupted in 2020 by the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The AFL season was suspended for more than two months and only resumed under strict quarantine arrangements \u2013 the VFL season was cancelled altogether. In the absence of reserves football, Clavarino pressed his case for AFL selection through the practice games arranged against other clubs. These scratch matches were played under relaxed rules and reduced numbers; on one occasion, Clavarino and some teammates played for Essendon to balance their match. The pandemic was not the only interruption to Clavarino's progress; he also suffered a hamstring injury in June, which kept him out of football for several weeks. In November, St Kilda moved Clavarino and his teammate Darragh Joyce to its rookie list under a new AFL provision permitting clubs to transfer two senior players in this way without ",
    "Hong Kong botanical artist\nMark Isaac-Williams (born 16 November 1939, Hong Kong) is an award-winning botanical artist, horticulturalist, and orchid expert; he has published several books on the subject.\nEarly life and education\nWilliams was born in Hong Kong to British parents, father Leonard, a sea captain, and mother Margery Isaac. In June 1940 the British Government required all women and children to leave Hong Kong as the Japanese forces had surrounded Hong Kong.  Williams and his mother sailed to Australia and lived in Watsons Bay, Sydney.  His father remained in Hong Kong and was interned at the Stanley Internment Camp.\nAfter WWII, Williams and his mother spent time in Shropshire, England, before returning to Hong Kong, where he and his parents lived at The Peninsula. The hotel had been occupied by the Japanese army during the war and at that point was in a very poor state, Williams describing it as \"full of mosquitos and rats.\"\nHe attended Kowloon Junior School and King George V secondary school. In 1951 the family moved into a new home on Kimberley Street. He then attended Moor Park School in Shropshire, England as a boarder from the age of 11, where he kept a \"nature notebook\". He moved to St Margaret's College in Devon to finish his O-Levels and then on to Shrewsbury College.\nWork\nAfter school, Williams initially worked for an advertising company in London but moved back to Hong Kong in 1959. He worked as a clerk for the British government communications office, stationed at Victoria Barracks, for seven years.\nIn 1962 he started teaching swimming at Diocesan Girls' School. The job evolved to become a full-time PE teaching position, which he held for 12 years. Around this time, he joined an \"amateur orchid group\" led by Gloria Barretto, an orchid expert at Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden (KFBG).\nIn 1979 Williams joined KFBG as a horticulturist, working alongside Barretto. On behalf of KFBG he travelled widely, including Australia, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Nepal and Papua New Guinea, collecting orchid specimens and studying plants in their native environment. In 1984 he left KFBG and ran two florist businesses. In 1985 he moved to Australia to run a plant nursery in Queensland. He lived in the UK from 2000 to 2006, returning to Hong Kong afterwards.\nIn Hong Kong, Williams was re-hired by KFBG to revive the Orchid Haven which had grown from six species in 1977 to over 150 in 2006. In 2011 the Gloria Barretto Orchid Sanctuary was opened, where Williams worked as a consultant. In 2013 he gave up this role and became KFBG's first ever resident artist. By the time he retired in 2020 he had painted pictures 130 varieties of orchids.\nArtwork\nAs an artist, Williams is entirely self-taught. His favourite medium is watercolour. In 2013 he earned a diploma from the Society of Botanical Artists (SBA). His prints are sold through the Lion Rock Press.\nBauhinia blakeana, watercolour painting by Mark Isaac-Williams\nExhibitions\nWilliams' paintings have appeared in the following exhibitions:\nSt John's Cathedral, Hong Kong, 2007\nUnited Services Recreation Club, 2009\nOut of the Woods: Celebrating Trees in Public Gardens American Society of Botanical Artists.

    "National Congress during World Autism Awareness Day 2019.\nAutism in Brazil has had a number of manifestations since the 20th century. It was introduced through child psychiatry with the predominant influence of psychoanalysis in medical care in the mid-1950s. The development of a community based on autism was late, with the founding of the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Amigos do Autista (AMA) in 1983. Since then, autism has become a topic of interest for family members, health professionals and autistic people with the predominance of a neurobiological view of the diagnosis.\nBefore there were initiatives aimed at diagnosis, autism appeared in newspaper headlines translated by news agencies. In the 1970s, some of the first congresses and institutions focussed on autism emerged. In the 1980s, the disorder began to gain greater public visibility with the emergence of associations founded by mothers and fathers, such as AMA and, later, the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Autismo (Abra). In the 1990s and 2000s, the popularisation of autism developed in different states of the country, while the first legislation was developed. At the end of the 2000s, discussions began about creating a national law on autism. In the 2010s, the National Policy for the Protection of the Rights of People with Autism Spectrum Disorders was sanctioned, while autistic people began to participate with greater emphasis in institutional activism, as well as the creation of media about autism.\nThe autism scene in Brazil is also characterised by tensions and conflicts between activists and organisations on issues such as health interventions, special education and autism representation. Until the 2020s, there was no prevalence of autism in the Brazilian population. For this reason, estimates based on figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were common in manifestos and journalistic texts.\nDescriptions and statistics\nLooking at the historical panorama, researchers Francisco Ortega, Rafaela Zorzanelli and Clarice Rios say that autism in Brazil represents a scenario of \"wars\" that are inserted in the definition of what autism is, in mental health policies and in media narratives. The authors also point out that, historically, psychoanalysis has lost ground, while behavioural approaches have become the main ones in the field. In 2022, the Ministry of Health described autism as \"a disorder characterised by the alteration of the individual's neurodevelopmental functions, interfering with the capacity for communication, language, social interaction and behaviour\", with an emphasis on early diagnosis and \"development of stimuli\".\nNumbers from Abra in 1997 estimated 600,000 people with \"classic autism\" in Brazil. In February 2011, the first autism epidemiology study in Latin America was published, with data from 2010, led by child psychiatrist Marcos Tomanik Mercadante. The study were based on a pilot project with a sample of 20,000 people in a neighbourhood in the S\u00e3o Paulo city of Atibaia, and measured the prevalence of one case of autism for every 368 children aged between 7 and 12. In the following years, different estimates of autism in Brazil were presented based on figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2014, it was estimated that there were 2 million autistic Brazilians, while by 2023 the number had risen to almost 6 million.\nIn 2019, in order to cover the gap in the number of autistic people in Brazil, Law 13.861/19 was sanctioned, which aimed to provide official data on the country. For this reason, the 2022 Brazilian census was the first to contain information on autism.\nHistory\n1950\u20131980: Background\nAccording to historian Bruna Alves Lopes, there were few records of autism in Brazil until the 1980s. In the 1940s, when the work of psychiatrist Leo Kanner introduced autism as an independent diagnosis, Brazil already had a significant influence of psychoanalysis in child care. The psychoanalytic field began to penetrate the country in the 1920s and achieved hegemony within psychiatry itself by the mid-1950s. At the same time, the idea that the cause of autism was a lack of bonding between the parents (especially mothers) and the child emerged with Kanner in 1948, but it was psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim who developed it throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn Brazil, the first journalistic publications related autism were made up of stories translated by news agencies from countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom and characterised the diagnosis as a disease. Some of them were influenced by a psychoanalytic bias, considering autistic children as belonging to cold and distant parents, while others addressed it as one of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Bettelheim's thinking had a significant influence on the journalistic content of these periods, with rare exceptions that cited Kanner's work and even behaviourist approaches. Most of them don't mention relevant and positive roles in relation",
    "2012 novel by Ayman Otoom\nHadith al-Jnoud (Arabic: \u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u062f, lit.\u2009'Soldiers' Talk') is a novel by Ayman Otoom, published in 2014. It describes the student demonstrations that occurred at Yarmouk University in Irbid, Jordan during the mid-1980s, particularly amidst the month of Ramadan in May 1986. These protests resulted in numerous casualties, injuries, and arrests, leaving a lasting impact on the collective memory of those involved. The narrative reflects the poignant recollections of the protest leader and his comrades, many of whom are still alive today. They entrusted their firsthand accounts of pain and fear to Otoom, recognizing his capability to convey their story. The novel faced censorship by the Jordanian Publications Department upon the arrival of its second edition from a private publishing house in Beirut. Ayman Otoom, the author, faced legal proceedings due to the ban imposed on the novel.\nThe protagonist, Ward, embodies the enduring trauma of those events, burdened by his role in leading the protests and haunted by memories that refuse to fade. The novel vividly transports readers to the streets of Irbid, immersing them in the tumultuous atmosphere of the demonstrations. Through Ward's perspective, readers witness the profound sacrifices made by individuals like Naima, whose unwavering loyalty to her deceased husband mirrors the steadfastness of those who fought for their beliefs. Ward's uncle emerges as a sage figure whose wisdom nourishes the flames of freedom in his nephew's soul, even as disillusionment threatens to extinguish them. Ward's companions on the revolutionary path represent a diverse spectrum of ideologies, yet they are united by a shared quest for justice and dignity. Their courage and resilience stand in stark contrast to the apathy of contemporary students, underscoring the depth of their commitment to principles and ideals.\nPlot\nThe narrative unfolds against the backdrop of Yarmouk University in Jordan during the turbulent mid-1980s. The protagonist, Ward, finds himself thrust into a leadership role amidst student protests erupting during the month of Ramadan in May 1986. As tensions escalate between the student body and university authorities, Ward becomes a central figure in the struggle for freedom, justice, and dignity. Ward and his companions navigate the complexities of activism in a repressive environment. Ward's sense of responsibility weighs heavily on him as he grapples with the moral implications of his actions, questioning whether his leadership stems from a genuine desire for change or the mere circumstances of fate.\nAmidst the chaos of the protests, Ward forms deep bonds with his fellow demonstrators, each representing a unique perspective and motivation for resistance. Naima, whose unwavering loyalty to her deceased husband mirrors the steadfastness of the protesters, emerges as a symbol of resilience in the face of adversity. Ward's uncle, a source of wisdom and guidance, imparts invaluable lessons on the true meaning of freedom and sacrifice. Through his mentorship, Ward comes to understand the gravity of his role as a leader and the sacrifices demanded by the pursuit of justice.\nIn the climax of events depicted, the Jordanian security forces launch a decisive crackdown on the student protests at Yarmouk University in 1986. This pivotal moment marks the culmination of escalating tensions between the students and the authorities, as the demonstrations for freedom and justice reach a critical juncture. The storming of Yarmouk University by security forces represents a turning point in the narrative, as the protesters find themselves confronted with the full force of state repression. The harrowing scene unfolds amidst a backdrop of chaos and violence, as students face off against heavily armed security personnel in a desperate bid to defend their rights and ideals.\nAs the protests intensify and the authorities crackdown on dissent, Ward and his comrades find themselves facing increasingly dire circumstances. The novel delves into the psychological toll of activism, exploring themes of trauma, resilience, and the enduring power of hope in the face of oppression.\nThe novel vividly captures the visceral intensity of the confrontation, depicting the clashes between protesters and security forces with raw emotional honesty. As the situation spirals out of control, the characters are forced to confront the brutal realities of state oppression and the harsh consequences of their defiance. The storming of Yarmouk University serves as a stark reminder of the sacrifices made by those who dare to challenge injustice, as the students' struggle for freedom and dignity exacts a heavy toll on both their bodies and souls. Despite the overwhelming odds stacked against them, the protesters refuse to back down, their resolve strengthened by a shared commitment to their cause.\nBan in Jordan\nThe Jordanian authorities have prohibited the distribution and circulation of the se",
    "1994 video game\nUmihara Kawase is a 1994 platformer developed and published by Japanese company TNN. It is the inaugural game in the Umihara Kawase series. It was first released in 1994 for the Super Famicom.\nGameplay\nSuper Famicom version screenshot\nUmihara Kawase is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls the titular character, Kawase Umihara. The player navigates \"fields,\" the game's levels, and completes it by entering one of its available exits. The player makes use of Kawase's fishing line, using it as a grappling hook to overcome hazards.\nThe game contains a total of 49 fields of which four are exit fields and six are boss fields. The game makes use of colour palette of the Super Famicom for digitized photographic backgrounds. The game permits saving speedruns, establishing such play as a principal feature of the series.\nThe game has a 30-minute time limit invisible to the player. When the timer runs out before reaching any end fields, the next exit always transports Kawase to the fixed single level (Field 28) regardless of the player's progress, after which the game ends.\nDevelopment\nUmihara Kawase started as one of the demos on the X68000, which the programmer Kiyoshi Sakai created to pitch it to the character designer Toshinobu Kondo. A series of showcase videos based on the prototype was later uploaded by Sakai on his YouTube channel in 2018.\nThe team behind the original Super Famicom version was composed of half a dozen developers, but Sakai was in charge of most of the development by himself, who designed, directed and programmed the game. While Sakai had worked on plenty of high-profile video games \u2013 including Euphory (1987), Boomer's Adventure in ASMIK World (1989), the home port of Cameltry (1989), and Mamono Hunter Y\u014dko: Dai 7 no Keish\u014d (1991) \u2013 Umihara Kawase was his first top-to-bottom project.\nUmihara Kawase was inspired by arcade platformers like Donkey Kong (1981) and Roc'n Rope (1983), where the player can see the whole stage in one screen. Sakai denied rumors that the game's swinging mechanics were taken from Capcom's arcade game Bionic Commando (1987), which he was only vaguely familiar with at the time. However, he was still aware of it before creating Umihara Kawase and regarded it as a possible inspiration.\nRelease\nUmihara Kawase was first released on the Super Famicom in Japan on December 23, 1994.\nThe Microsoft Windows version was published by Agatsuma Entertainment on November 2, 2015. It was developed by Studio Saizensen, a studio founded by the series character designer Toshinobu Kondo. The slowdown from the Super Famicom version is no longer present with the addition of a practice mode. It's a worldwide release available through Steam and supports Steam Cloud saves, leaderboards and Steam Workshop access. On November 24, 2015, the day the Windows version of Umihara Kawase Shun made its worldwide debut, Agatsuma Entertainment bundled the first three games in the series on Steam into Umihara Kawase Trilogy, which can be bought at reduced price together. In January 2016, every game in the trilogy was delisted from Steam after Agatsuma Entertainment closed its doors in December 2015. The publishing rights to the series was promptly acquired by Degica, which relisted the trilogy to Steam on January 28, 2016.\nThe Super Famicom version was made available in Japan for the Nintendo Switch Online service on May 26, 2022. In the other regions, it was replaced with Congo's Caper.\nReception\nReception\nOn release, Famitsu scored the game 7, 7, 7 and 7 with a total of 28 out of 40. Reviewers compared it to the Family Computer game Hitler's Resurrection: Top Secret (released for the Nintendo Entertainment System as Bionic Commando) and praised its complex utility of fishing line in gameplay.\nThe Super Famicom version of the game was not released in North America and Europe at the time, having remained obscure in the west since. A few journalists noted they never learned about the game and its series until it's featured in an episode of the gaming variety show GameCenter CX, which was aired on June 7, 2006.\nNotes\n^ Windows port developed by Studio Saizensen.\n^ Umihara Kawase (Japanese: \u6d77\u8179\u5ddd\u80cc, Hepburn: Umihara Kawase)\n^ Her surname is Umihara and her given name Kawase; Umihara comes first in the game's title because of the conventions of Japanese name order.\n",

    "German ceramicist (1832\u20131893)\nHermann Seger (1832\u20131893) was a German ceramicist who is widely credited with pioneering the development of the pyrometric cone, which enabled the rapid growth of the ceramic industry around the turn of the century.\nBiography\nSeger was born in the German Province of Posen in 1839 to wealthy parents and studied under various ceramic scientists at the Royal Technical Institute in Berlin.\nAfter graduating he managed an aluminum and metal processing plant in Kreuzkirche. In 1868 he graduated from the University of Rostock and briefly managed a chemical factory in Sweden.\nSeger was inspired by the significant advances being made in most fields of science and technology at the time and became interested in advancing the field of ceramic science in a similar manner. He became editor of a ceramic trade journal in 1872 and used his new position to draw attention to various advances being made abroad, such as the continuous kiln and new machinery.\nSeger's 1876 essay The Constitution of Plastic Clays and the Kaolins helped promote the understanding that most clay behavior is a result of its chemical composition, paving the way for further development of ceramic studies.\nIn 1878 he was appointed first director of the Chemical-Technical Experiment Station at the Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin (KPM). Soon after his arrival he was given two samples of Japanese porcelain bodies and was inspired to develop a porcelain consisting only of quartz, feldspar, and clay substance, which has since led to a variety of porcelains known as Seger porcelain.\nHe worked with Georg Wilhelm Timm to develop new methods of applying glazes and engobes to porcelain and whiteware. Seger also experimented with glaze formulations, developing new color effects and lead-free glazes.\nOne of Seger's most impactful works was his 1886 essay Standard Cones for the Measurement of Temperatures in the Kilns of the Ceramic Industries, which was the first to specify formulas for pyrometric cones. These cones enabled ceramicists to precisely identify the actual firing temperature for the first time by monitoring the cones' slumping during firing.\nIn 1890 Seger left the KPM due to declining health and spent the remainder of his life focused on editing his trade journal Thonindustrie-Zeitung. He died on 30 October 1893.\nPersonal life\nSeger married Emma Schur on 11 September 1875.\nLegacy\nSeger had a large impact on ceramic industry and art. His work helped spur greater interest in the chemistry and molecular properties of ceramics and formed the basis of most following ceramic research.\nThe American Ceramic Society's first action after approving their constitution was to translate the complete works of Seger, since he was considered the world's pioneering ceramicist.\nHe is commonly credited with creating the Unity Molecular Formula (UMF) method of glaze formulation, which is sometimes referred to as the Seger formula. It functions on the basis of viewing glazes not by their raw ingredient composition, but instead by their elemental composition by mole percent.\nSeger's pyrometric cones remain the most effective gauge of the heat-work experienced by ceramics during firing, and continue to be widely used internationally in ceramic industries and art. These are often referred to as Seger cones.\n",
    "1881 Australian play\nOstracised, or Every Man's Hand Against Them is a 1881 Australian play about Ned Kelly by E.C. Martin. It was the first straight dramatisation of the Kelly story from an Australian writer although there had been one in London. The play was banned in Sydney.\nMartin was a journalist and occasional playwright (What May Happen to a Man in Victoria). He claimed to have \"not written it to pander to the morbid tastes of the public, but rather-to show that vice ever meets its reward.\"\nAccording to academic Richard Fotheringham \"Martin seems to have developed the idea that Dan Kelly was the true psycho path of the piece and that Ned Kelly... had been dragged unwillingly into the disaster.\" The play appears to have been interspersed with songs.\nIn the lead up to the play debuting there were rumours the play would be banned \"on the grounds of its alleged demoralising tendency, and the reflections cast by it upon the character of the police force\u00a0; but as the play\nproceeded, it became evident that theie rumours were unfounded.\"\nPublic reaction\nContemporary accounts say the play \"hit the morbid public taste in Melbourne.\" According to the Truth the play \"made a pot of money\".\nSydney Sportsman said the play \"made a pot of money, though the dramatist... saw little of it.\" Another account said \"the author did not collect in full, for every barnstorming co. in Australia froze on to the play with more or less distorted versions of it.\"\nThe Perth Daily News said \"The piece was one of the greatest successes ever known, and for six solid weeks the performance ran to huge business. The papers gave the piece 'what for,' but the public appetite was fairly whetted.\"\nA writer claimed prior to a performance of the play in Benalla, local police advised the removal of the prologue involving Harry Power, and this was done. Mrs Kelly reportedly attended this performance. Reporting on this performance the Benalla Standard said \"the audience... throughout were orderly; and although several well-known Kelly sympathisers were present, the attendance of the three policemen on duty was not required.\"\nAnother story says the real Constable Longeran attended one performance and objected during the show to how he was portrayed.\nSydney banning\nThe play had two seasons in Melbourne and toured New Zealand but was banned from playing in Sydney in 1882 (after one performance there) due to the intervention of the Inspector General of Police.  According to contemporary reports, the play, then called Ostracised, or the Downfall of Crime, debuted in Sydney at Victoria Hall on 8 April 1882. On Monday 10 April 1882 audiences arrived to see a second production and were told that the play at been banned. Instead a production of Ticket of Leave Man was put on. According to The Bulletin in 1920, \"after the overture\" the manager \"stepped to the front of the curtain and announced that the police had banned the play. Uproar ensued. Some men-of-war\u2019s men from the Raleigh then in port got at loggerheads with the police; reinforcements were rushed up, the lights were put out, and so were the rioters.\"\nThis banning effectively ended production of plays about the Kelly gang for over a decade until The Kelly Gang played in Melbourne in 1898 without controversy, prompting a boom in Ned Kelly plays over the next decade.\nCritical reaction\nThe Weekly Times said \"The dialogue is poorly written, and the first two acts drag somewhat, and could be judiciously curtailed. The character are unusually numerous, and representing persons familiar by repute to the audience.\"\nAccording to the Leader the author \"wanted to evolve a moral play from the tragic incidents connected with the career and fate of the Kelly gang of outlaws; but the actors, desirous of rendering the piece more diverting than instructive, introduced so much of the farcical element that it was at times extremely difficult to trace the author's meaning.\"\nThe Ballarat Star said the author \"has managed to string together the incidents of the Kellys career with some degree of consecutiveness, and prepared a drama which at the events raises a laugh and evidently excites the auditor\u2019s interest. It is not a very high literary ambition to produce such a piece but apparently it pays, and - we presume - this was the real reason for its production.\"\nThe Evening Journal said \"I am astonished at the performance being permitted. I am quite willing to admit that the author does not intend its production to do any harm, and that he may even have had a moral purpose in view in writing it. But it does harm unquestionably, and the moral doesn't show out. There is certainly... nothing dangerous in it. The Chief Commissioner of Police is not called a fool or a coward, nor is Ned Kelly held up as an example of injured innocence. But the effect of making these four bloodthirsty cowardly murderers the centre features in a play is bad.\"\nThe Benalla Standard said, \"The several characters were well sustained by the differe",
    "Mass injection flow refers to inviscid, adiabatic flow through a constant area duct where the effect of mass addition is considered.  For this model, the duct area remains constant, the flow is assumed to be steady and one-dimensional, and mass is added within the duct. Because the flow is adiabatic, unlike in Rayleigh flow, the stagnation temperature is a constant. Compressibility effects often come into consideration, though this flow model also applies to incompressible flow.\nFor supersonic flow (an upstream Mach number greater than 1), deceleration occurs with mass addition to the duct and the flow can become choked. Conversely, for subsonic flow (an upstream Mach number less than 1), acceleration occurs and the flow can become choked given sufficient mass addition.  Therefore, mass addition will cause both supersonic and subsonic Mach numbers to approach Mach 1, resulting in choked flow.\nTheory\nThe 1D mass injection flow model begins with a mass-velocity relation derived for mass injection into a steady, adiabatic, frictionless, constant area flow of calorically perfect gas:\n\u00a0\nd\nm\nm\n=\n\u2212\nd\nu\nu\n(\nM\n2\n\u2212\n1\n)\n{\\displaystyle \\ {\\frac {dm}{m}}=-{\\frac {du}{u}}\\left(M^{2}-1\\right)}\nwhere \nm\n{\\displaystyle m}\n represents a mass flux, \nm\n=\nm\n\u02d9\n/\nA\n{\\displaystyle m={\\dot {m}}/A}\n.  This expression describes how velocity will change with a change in mass flux (i.e. how a change in mass flux \nd\nm\n{\\displaystyle dm}\n drives a change in velocity \nd\nu\n{\\displaystyle du}\n).  From this relation, two distinct modes of behavior are seen:\nWhen flow is subsonic (\nM\n<\n1\n{\\displaystyle M<1}\n) the quantity \n[\nM\n2\n\u2212\n1\n]\n{\\displaystyle }\n is negative, so the right-hand side of the equation becomes positive.  This indicates that increasing mass flux will increase subsonic flow velocity toward Mach 1.\nWhen flow is supersonic (\nM\n>\n1\n{\\displaystyle M>1}\n) the quantity \n[\nM\n2\n\u2212\n1\n]\n{\\displaystyle }\n is positive, so the right-hand side of the equation becomes negative.  This indicates that increasing mass flux will decrease supersonic flow velocity towards Mach 1.\nFrom the mass-velocity relation, an explicit mass-Mach relation may be derived:\nd\nm\nm\n=\n1\n\u2212\nM\n2\nM\n+\n1\n2\nM\n3\n(\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n1\n)\nd\nM\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {dm}{m}}={\\frac {1-M^{2}}{M+{\\frac {1}{2}}M^{3}(\\gamma -1)}}dM}\nDerivations\nAlthough Fanno flow and Rayleigh flow are covered in detail in many textbooks, mass injection flow is not. For this reason, derivations of fundamental mass flow properties are given here.  In the following derivations, the constant \nR\n{\\displaystyle R}\n is used to denote the specific gas constant (i.e. \nR\n=\nR\n\u00af\n/\nM\n{\\displaystyle R={\\bar {R}}/M}\n).\nMass-Velocity Relation\nWe begin by establishing a relationship between the differential enthalpy, pressure, and density of a calorically perfect gas:\nFrom the adiabatic energy equation (\nd\nh\n0\n=\n0\n{\\displaystyle dh_{0}=0}\n) we find:\nSubstituting the enthalpy-pressure-density relation (1) into the adiabatic energy relation (2) yields\nNext, we find a relationship between differential density, mass flux (\nm\n=\nm\n\u02d9\n/\nA\n{\\displaystyle m={\\dot {m}}/A}\n), and velocity:\nSubstituting the density-mass-velocity relation (4) into the modified energy relation (3) yields\nSubstituting the 1D steady flow momentum conservation equation (see also the Euler equations) of the form \nd\np\n=\n\u2212\n\u03c1\nu\nd\nu\n{\\displaystyle dp=-\\rho udu}\n into (5) yields\nFrom the ideal gas law we find,\nand from the definition of a calorically perfect gas we find,\nSubstituting expressions (7) and (8) into the combined equation (6) yields\nUsing the speed of sound in an ideal gas (\na\n2\n=\n\u03b3\nR\nT\n{\\displaystyle a^{2}=\\gamma RT}\n) and the definition of the Mach number (\nM\n=\nu\n/\na\n{\\displaystyle M=u/a}\n) yields\nMass-Velocity Relation\nd\nm\nm\n=\n\u2212\nd\nu\nu\n[\nM\n2\n\u2212\n1\n]\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {dm}{m}}=-{\\frac {du}{u}}}\nThis is the mass-velocity relationship for mass injection into a steady, adiabatic, frictionless, constant area flow of calorically perfect gas.\nMass-Mach Relation\nTo find a relationship between differential mass and Mach number, we will find an expression for \nd\nu\n/\nu\n{\\displaystyle du/u}\n solely in terms of the Mach number, \nM\n{\\displaystyle M}\n.  We can then substitute this expression into the mass-velocity relation to yield a mass-Mach relation.  We begin by relating differential velocity, mach number, and speed of sound:\nWe can now re-express \nd\na\n{\\displaystyle da}\n in terms of \nd\nT\n{\\displaystyle dT}\n:\nSubstituting (12) into (11) yields,\nWe can now re-express \nd\nT\n{\\displaystyle dT}\n in terms of \nd\nu\n{\\displaystyle du}\n:\nBy substituting (14) into (13), we can create an expression completely in terms of \nd\nu\n{\\displaystyle du}\n and \nd\nM\n{\\displaystyle dM}\n.  Performing this substitution and solving for \nd\nu\n/\nu\n{\\displaystyle du/u}\n yields,\nFinally, expression (15) for \nd\nu\n/\nu\n{\\displaystyle du/u}\n in terms of \nd\nM\n{\\displaystyle dM}\n may be substituted directly into the mass-velocity relation (10):\nMass-Mach Relation\nd\nm\nm\n=\n1\n\u2212\nM\n2\nM\n+\n1\n2\nM\n3\n(\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n1\n)\nd\nM",
    "Ancient site related Lord Shiva and Brahmarshi Vashishtha\nSee also: Vashishtha, Uttarvahini Ganga, Ashtavakra Mandir,\u00a0and Kahalgaon\nBateshwar Sthan ( Sanskrit: \u092c\u091f\u0947\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928 ) is an ancient site related to the Vedic sage Brahmarshi Vashishtha at Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur district of Bihar, India. It is believed as the Taposthali ( penance place ) of the sage Vashishtha where he established Shivlinga known as Bateshwar Nath Mahadeva.\nEtymology\nThe temple was named after the sage Vashishtha. Earlier this temple was known as Bashishtheshvar ( Vashishtheshwar ) Mahadev, which later came to be known as Bateshwar Mahadev. Thus the place is called as Bateshwar Sthan.\nDescription\nIt is said that Sage Vasishtha performed his penance here and worshiped Lord Shiva there. There is a temple of Lord Shiva known as Baba Bateshwar Nath Mahadev Mandir in the campus of Bateshwar Sthan. The temple is at foothills of Bateshwar mountain on the bank of the north flowing Ganga located ten kilometres away from Kahalgaon. This is also the confluence point of the Ganga and Kosi rivers. According to legend, it is said that in Puranas it is mentioned that Kahalgaon's Bateshwar Sthan was planned to make Kashi Dham but due to lack of some land it remained incomplete in the making of Kashi Dham. According to legendary story, after the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, they were living at Kailash. But Goddess Parvati was not feeling comfortable there because Kailash was in the territory of Parvatraj Himalaya. It is said Lord Shiva realised it and he wished to fullfill by choosing another destination for living. Devashree Narada and Lord Vishwakarma was assigned to find piece of land equal to Kailash. For this, the condition was that the entire plot of land should be situated on the bank of Ganga river where Ganga flows northwards ( Uttarvahini Ganga ) and that place should also be sacred. Then Devashree Narada and Lord Vishwakarma searched three places, they were Bateshwar Sthan of Kahalgaon, Chitabhumi of Devgarh in Jharkhand, and Varanasi of Uttar Pradesh. Due to the presence of Shaktipeeth at Chitabhumi, this place was not considered suitable for the residence of both of them. Similarly there was a shortcoming with Bateshwar Sthan situated near Kahalgaon, this land was a bit less than the size of Kailash. After that Varanasi was finally selected as Kashi of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. According to Puranas, Bateshwar Sthan is also known as Gupta Kashi. It is believed that Lord Buddha also stayed here for three months to do meditation during the Varshavasa period.\nThere is a temple of Maa Kali just opposite of the Bateshwar Nath Mahadev Mandir.  It is said that in ancient times, it used to be a major center of Tantra Vidya. The origination of the ancient Vikramshila University is also related to this place which is three kilometers away from the temple. Earlier Tantra Vidya was taught in the ancient Vikramshila University.\nHistory\nIt is said that the temple was built in 1216 CE by the King of Sen Dynasty in Bengal. According to the Vangiya Kayastha Kul Panchika, during the reign of the Sen rulers of Bengal, Ballala Sena came here and worshipped the Shiva lingam on the occasion of declaring his father-in-law Vata Krishna Mitra as the king of Magadha. Similarly it was renovated in 1272 CE by Mathuranatha Chattopadhyaya who a resident of Hooghly in Bengal.\n",
    "Japanese botanist (1886\u20131976)\nMarquess Yoshichika Tokugawa (\u5fb7\u5ddd \u7fa9\u89aa, Tokugawa Yoshichika, 5 October 1886 \u2013 6 September 1976) was a Japanese botanist, hunter, patron of the arts and sciences, and politician. He was the 19th head of the Owari-Tokugawa family, one of the Tokugawa Gosanke.\nLife\nYoshichika was born into the Matsudaira family of Echizen (now Fukui), which originated as a cadet branch of the Tokugawa family and was closely related to the family through repeated intermarriages. He attended Gakushuin, just like other children from his class (kazoku), where he spent most of his time reading books about explorers such as Henry Stanley and Roald Amundsen. He started studying seriously around 1902, when he entered a crammer called Jishusha.\nHe matriculated at Tokyo Imperial University in 1908 and studied history. He married Yoneko, the daughter of the 18th head of the Owari-Tokugawa family and adopted her family name, immediately becoming the 19th head of the family. His thesis in 1911 was on the management of the vast Kiso estate traditionally owned by his family. Having been interested in botany from a young age, he decided to stay at the university to further his interests. During his time at the university, he granted the faculty of the university access to his family's treasures. In May 1915, he held an exhibition of his family's artefacts at the Sanjo Hall of the university's Hongo Campus. Overwhelmed by the interest shown by the visitors, he recognised the importance of preserving and exhibiting family artefacts. He set up the Tokugawa Art Museum and the Hosa Library in the 1930s to permanently preserve and exhibit the family artefacts.\nHis passion for botany and hunting made him travel extensively, including his elephant and tiger hunting tour in British Malaya, which gave him the nickname \"toragari no tonosama (tiger-hunting lord)\". He befriended local sultans in Malaya, and after returning from his second visit in 1929, he started learning the Malay language. He hosted Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and Ranee Sylvia Brett of the White Rajah of Sarawak in the 1930s.\nDuring the Second World War, he went to what was now Japanese-occupied Malaya as a military advisor, where he served as the director at what is now the National Museum of Singapore. However, as Japan faced significant losses, he had to return to Japan in 1944. The English botanist E. J. H. Corner, who was asked to continue serving as the director of the Singapore Botanical Gardens during the occupation, wrote about the marquess's activities in his memoir \"The MARQUIS - A Tale of Syonan-to\".\nAfter the war, he funded the founding of the Japan Socialist Party. His fortune had diminished to no more than 20% of its pre-war extent. He served as an honorary chair at various charitable organisations. He died in 1976.\n",
    "Former lifeboat station in Northumberland, England\nBoulmer Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the village of Boulmer in the county of Northumberland. \nA lifeboat, provided by the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), was first stationed here by the Newcastle Shipwreck Association in 1825.\nThe RNLI station was closed in 1968.\nHistory\nA station was opened at Boulmer in 1925 under the management of the Newcastle Shipwreck Association (NSA), following a request by Mr. William Clarke to the (RNIPLS) for a lifeboat. A boathouse was constructed by the NSA, and a lifeboat was duly provided, a 27-foot 6in 10-oared North Country, or \"Greathead\", type lifeboat, built by Thomas Wake of Sunderland.\nThis first Boulmer lifeboat would serve 27 years, and save 32 lives. On November 2nd 1844, the Boulmer lifeboat made three trips to the wreck of the Iris and would rescue 8 men. Lt. John Brunton, RN, of H.M. Coastguard was awarded the Silver Medal.\nIn 1851, the Boulmer boat was reported as being in poor condition, and a request was made of the RNIPLS to provide a replacement. A 30-foot self-righting lifeboat built by James Beeching of Great Yarmouth was provided, at a cost of \u00a3130. It was funded by Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, and was named Prudhoe, the Duke having formerly been known as Lord Prudhoe.\nIn 1853, Boulmer Lifeboat Station would be transferred to the management of the RNIPLS, which became the RNLI the following year.\nPrudhoe(I) didn't serve long at Boulmer. The boat was disliked by the crew, and a second replacement was requested. This time, a 30-foot 10-oar self-righting boat was supplied by Forrestt of Limehouse, London, arriving in Boulmer on 30 November 1854. This time costing \u00a3150, it was once again funded by the Duke of Northumberland, and was again named Prudhoe. Whether the boat was no good is up for speculation. It capsized when being towed back to Newcastle, but then went on to serve at Thorpeness, Newhaven and Fishguard, in service until 1885.\nOn 13 March 1913, in a severe gale, heavy seas, and dense fog, the french steam trawler Tadorne of Boulogne with 30 crew ran aground near Howick Haven. Three men tried to make shore in the ships boat, but two were drowned. The rest of the crew clung to the rigging, as large waves crashed over the boat. On surveying the scene, Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey of nearby Howick Hall despatched a messenger to raise the Boulmer lifeboat. After an extraordinary effort, and two trips, the Boulmer lifeboat managed to save 25 men off the trawler. Coxswain William Stephenson was awarded a Gold Medal from the French government, the RNLI Silver Medal, and two awards from the French Lifeboat Service, Societe Hospitaliers Sauveteurs Bretons. The wreck of the steam engine is still visible today.\nA Clayton launch and recovery tractor was trialled at Boulmer in 1922, but with little success. An article in \"The Lifeboat\" magazine of 1926 highlighted that some 115 people of the village Boulmer, around 80%, could be involved in the launch of the lifeboat. As a result, the women lifeboat launchers were awarded The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum.\nIn 1927, another Clayton launch tractor was placed at Boulmer, but a larger more powerful FWD Ltd tractor, T23, was trialled in 1928. The lifeboat and carriage were hauled a \u00bd-mile across mud, and then 150 yards out to sea, launching in just 24 minutes, proving the tractor a great success. T26 was placed on service in 1930.\nSoon afterwards followed a motor-powered lifeboat. L. P. and St. Helen (ON 703), a 35-foot 6in Self-righting motor lifeboat built by S.E. Saunders of Cowes, so named after her benefactors, Miss Ann Lovelock, Mr A H Pett, and Miss Helen Turner, arrived in Boulmer in 1931.\nIn 1967, it was decided to withdraw the All-weather lifeboat from Boulmer. The boat was formally withdrawn on 31 March 1968, replaced on 1 April with an Inshore D-class (D-100) lifeboat on station for a 1-year trial. With only two service launches, and no lives saved, the D-class was also withdrawn at the end of the summer season. After 143 years of service, 199 service launches, and with 236 lives saved, Boulmer RNLI lifeboat station closed at the end of 1968.\n1969 saw the foundation of the Boulmer Volunteer Rescue Service. The former RNLI boathouse was given over to the rescue service, which is still in operation to this day.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Boulmer.\nGold Medal, awarded by the French Government\nWilliam Stephenson, Coxswain - 1913\nRNLI Silver Medal\nLt.

    "\n1982 Harmak incident  refers to the accidental infiltration of Iranian territory during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War, in which Soviet forces strayed from the target of a Mujahideen base in southern Afghanistan and accidentally destroyed an asphalt factory in Iran.\nBackground\nBy 1982, the Soviet\u2013Afghan War had been raging on for two years, and seemingly wasn't close to an end. The Soviets were in the control of major population centres while the rural areas were mostly under Mujahideen control.\nPlanning\nIn March 1982, the  Soviets decided to destroy a vital supply base at the village of Robat Jaali in southern Afghanistan just a few kilometres from the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran tripoint, given the nickname  of  \"The Bermuda Triangle\" by the Soviets. According to Soviet intelligence, this was a vital Mujahideen base with about 60 militants and huge cache of weapons and ammunition. The operation was planned in Moscow, and to maintain operational secrecy the Soviet military did not inform either the Afghan Army or KHAD as both had many Mujahideen informants.\nThe operation was commanded by General Anatoly Tabunshchikov, who in an Antonov command plane would follow the main strike force and do a photo evaluation of the raid, while the forces themselves would be led by Colonel Vladimir Aprelkin. The plan was complicated as the target was at a large distance and Soviet helicopters couldn't reach the target without refueling. Ultimately it was decided that a force of 600 Soviet troops, including Spetsnaz special forces, would assemble about 50 kilometres from Robat Jaali for refueling on 4 April. The next morning, the target would be bombed by about 12 Su-17s followed by 60 Mi-8 who would capture the target along with all its supplies. Then after six hours they would be refueled and return to base.\nIncident\nThe operation did not go as planned. Just as the helicopters flew from their base for refueling point, they faced a severe sandstorm causing them to split into small groups, each of which had to reach the point on its own with the last groups reaching at night.\nOn the morning of 5 April, the strike force departed from the refueling point for the target, with Colonel Aprelkin as a passenger in the frontal helicopter. At the specified time, two Su-17s dropped parachute flares to mark the location of the target and the other Su-17s successfully bombed the target.\nHowever, some flares were released too high, and a strong wind blew them off course by several kilometres and they landed on the Iranian side of the border.\nAfter the arrival of the strike force, the leading helicopter crew who been there earlier told Colonel Aprelkin that they were not on their target location, but the commander, Colonel Aprelkin disagreed and stated that the strike force had not yet arrived at the target location. He ordered the pilot to keep flying towards the flares and the rest of the strike group followed.\nAfter some time they came across a road  with a civilian bus driving on it but no such roads were on the Soviet map. Colonel Aprelkin was again informed  but now the Colonel saw some buildings and he was convinced that it was their target of Robat Jaali. He issued an order to the force to engage.\nThe lead helicopter landed at the purported target and soon others in the strike force also landed. In about twenty minutes, the Soviet soldiers came out of their helicopters and captured the compound which was guarded by only two civilian guards.\nThe Soviets soon realised it wasn't their target but an ordinary civilian asphalt factory which was closed on that day. \nAt the same time, General Tabunshchikov who came for damage assessment saw the situation and informed Colonel Aprelkin over radio that the strike force had crossed the Iranian border and landed near the town of Harmak. General Tabunshchikov ordered the strike force to evacuate immediately. He informed his superiors telling them, \"Our troops are on foreign territory!\"\nIranian response\nTwo F-4 Phantom II fighters from the Iranian Air Force arrived and opened fire on the landed Mi-8s, they were followed by two more F-4s. The Soviet MiG-23s had been ordered by the General not to engage. \"It was bad enough that we had attacked the Iranian town,\"  Tabunshchikov said, \"and there was no need to escalate the problem by shooting down Iranian airplanes over Iran.\" The Iranian F-4s managed to destroy two Mi-8s.\nBy that time a group of Iranian Army tanks approached and started firing, the Soviets were again ordered not to engage; the Iranians retook the factory. The Soviets hastily retreated, leaving some personnel behind who they were forced to walk the three hours back to the Afghan border.\nAftermath\nMujahideen became aware of the Soviet failure and were able to evacuate their base before the Soviet raid. The, Iranian government filed diplomatic protests with the Soviet Union. Soviet officials issued a formal statement accepting responsibility for the mistake and compensation was paid. The offic",
    "Painting by Francisco de Goya\nLa novillada (\"The Running of the Young Bulls\"), is a painting by Francisco de Goya, painted in 1780, when he was trying his hand at bullfighting (script period). It is part of the fourth series of tapestry cartoons for the Prince of Asturias' antechamber in the Pardo Palace.\nContext\nGoya was an aficionado, and frequented the world of bullfighting, considered at the time to be \"the refuge of scoundrels where ruffians and adventurers are at ease\". He describes La Novillada as a cape pass involving several young men, but does not name himself along them, even though he more or less portrayed himself. He subsequently painted several portraits of bullfighters, the best-known of which is that of Pedro Romero.\nHistory\nAll the paintings in the fourth series were destined for the antechamber of the Prince of Asturias, the future Charles IV and his wife Marie Louise de Parme, in the Pardo palace. The painting was delivered to the Royal Tapestry Factory on January 24, 1780 and received by its director, Cornelio Vandergoten. A document dated October 2, 1777, whose provenance is unknown, states that the La Novillada tapestry was to hang on the south wall of the princes' antechamber next to another tapestry: El Resguardo de tabacos.\nIt was considered lost until 1869, when the canvas was discovered in the basement of the Royal Palace in Madrid by Gregorio Cruzada Villaamil, and was returned to the Prado Museum in 1870 by the ordinances of January 19 and February 9, 1870, where it is exhibited in room 91. The painting was first mentioned in the Museo del Prado catalog in 1876.\nThe series was composed of El Ciego de la guitarra, El Columpio, Las Lavanderas, La Novillada, El Resguardo de tabacos, El Muchacho del p\u00e1jaro et El Ni\u00f1o del \u00e1rbol, Los Le\u00f1adores, El Majo de la guitarra, La Cita, El M\u00e9dico, El Balanc\u00edn and two lost pieces: El Perro and La Fuente.\nDescription\nThe painting depicts a festival similar to Francisco Bayeu's Taureaux de Carabanchel. Historian Jos\u00e9 Cam\u00f3n Aznar sees a connection with Goya's childhood memories (when he tried his hand at bullfighting). It is said that the bright colors drove the weavers at the Royal Factory mad, as they were commissioned to create tapestries based on Goya's sketch.\nThe ensemble features a group of young people in colorful costumes, and in the main figure, who turns his head towards the viewers, a portrait of the artist himself has been seen. This is also what Claude Pelletier says: \"A witness to his time, Goya was probably an amateur bullfighter in his youth. Here, he has portrayed himself in a red costume, as the main character in this humble novillada.\nThe bright colors are characteristic of Goya's \"first period\", as is the abundance of Majos who were, depending on the occasion, either commoners or noblemen dressed as such. \u00c9douard Manet described them in one of his best-known paintings, Jeune Homme en costume de majo. The majos and majas were known for their sartorial pursuits inspired by popular customs.\nHowever, Cornelio Vandergoten, the director of the production, gives a different version of Goya's interpretation of the scene. According to him, the figures here are in a sorto position.\nThe Swing and La Novillada could represent a passage written by Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn, Leandro's father, in the clandestine poem Arte de las putas:\"Flee the right-handed one so accursed custom\nalways give the hurgonazo in passing\nto C\u00e1ndido inciting, the great bullfighter\nwhich, by the prompt, is clean his thrust \"\n- Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn, Arte de las putas (II, 135-138)\"Run away from this good habit so cursed\nalways give a blow of the saddle in passing\ninciting Candide, the great bullfighter\nwhose stockade is suddenly clean\"\nHowever, according to Jeannine Baticle, Goya didn't start frequenting the capital's Lumi\u00e8res until 1779, and it's likely that he only gained access to this poem - written in the early 1770s - through them, and therefore after the production of this carton.\nGoya's La Tauromaquia\nIn addition to La Tauromaquia, Goya was greatly inspired by popular bullfighting games. There are several replicas of his Children Playing Bulls, including one in Madrid's Museo L\u00e1zaro Galdiano; The Picador, an oil on canvas (56 \u00d7 47\u00a0cm) in the Prado Museum, is thought to be a study for a larger painting for the Almeda de Osuna entitled Choice of Bulls.\nAfter his illness, which left him deaf, Goya devoted himself almost exclusively to bullfighting during a stay in Andalusia in 1790. The result was a series of twelve small metal paintings entitled Sc\u00e8nes de divertissements nationaux, which he presented as a means of \u201coccupying his mortified imagination\u201d. We usually refer to eight of these small paintings, which form a coherent whole twenty years before the Tauromachie grav\u00e9e, as the S\u00e9rie Torrecilla, named after the marquis to whom this collection had belonged.\nThere are countless works on the subject of bullfighting, and they are not always easy to l",
    "Hotel in Spain\nThe Parador de Oropesa, also known as Virrey de Toledo, is a four-star Parador hotel located in the town of Oropesa, in the province of Toledo, in the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain. It was converted over a number of years from two of the buildings forming the compound of the Castillo de Oropesa\u00a0 (Oropesa Castle). The Parador is located both in the Palacio Viejo (Old Palace), also known as the Palacio Do\u00f1a Elvira, which dates from the end of the 14th century, and in the Palacio Nuevo (Oropesa)\u00a0 (New Palace), also known as the Palacio de los \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, which was built in the 16th century.\nThe two palaces were the residence of the Condado de Oropesa\u00a0 (Counts of Oropesa), part of the noble family of the Casa de Toledo\u00a0 (House of Toledo). The family died out in the early 19th century and the castle and palaces were inherited by the Duque de Fr\u00edas (Dukes of Fr\u00edas). In the early 20th century the buildings passed into public ownership, serving as a school, housing for the Guardia Civil (Civil Guard), a theatre, the municipal slaughterhouse, and storage for grain, while the central courtyard served as a bullring and as a location for local entertainment and festivities.\nIn 1929 part of the New Palace was converted into one of the earliest Paradores, the first to be constructed within a pre-existing historical building, with nine bedrooms and space for 19 guests. Much expanded since, into both the New and Old Palaces, it is now one of most popular venues in the Parador chain.\nThe original buildings and their early history\nThe Parador de Oropesa is within the complex of the castle of Oropesa which consists of four attached major buildings: two castles and two palaces, together known as the Palacio Condal (Comital Palace). The Castillo Viejo (Old Castle) or Patio Musulm\u00e1n (Muslim Courtyard) dates from the 12th and 13th centuries and the Castillo Nuevo (New Castle) from the 14th and 15th centuries. The Parador is situated in the two palaces, the Palacio Viejo (Old Palace) of the 15th century, and the Palacio Nuevo (New Palace) built in the 16th century.\nBeginnings\nThe Oropesa castle began as a watchtower on a hilltop to control the transit of livestock. It was built by the Vettones, an Iron Age pre-Roman people of the Iberian Peninsula. Later the Romans built another tower there to control the road they had built between the cities of Toledo and M\u00e9rida. They also built an inn to serve travellers, provide horse supplies and house military detachments. The Muslim occupation of Iberia, begun in the year 711, saw the building of the original much larger fortress on the remains of the ancient Roman castellum. Two circular towers of Arab origin remain as part of the later fortifications.\nCrown ownership\nOropesa Castle in the present day\nKing Alfonso VI de Le\u00f3n y Castilla captured Toledo in 1085 and Oropesa and the Muslim-built castle came under his control. His descendant Alfonso X de Castilla gifted the town to its citizens, and his son, Juan de Castilla rewarded the Oropesa nobles for their loyalty with further fortifications and the building of a town wall in 1321. In 1366 Enrique II de Castilla granted the lordship of Oropesa to Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez de Toledo as a reward for supporting him in the war against Pedro el Cruel.\nAristocratic ownership and the first palace\nGarc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez de Toledo's son, Fern\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, the second lord of Oropesa, with his wife Elvira de Ayala, lady of Cebolla,  built the first palace and enlarged the castle at the end of the 14th century. This palace, on the north side of the castle complex and abutting the castle, is a Mud\u00e9jar-Gothic building with a long hall room on the upper floor approached from the courtyard by a wide stone interior staircase. The hall was embellished by a polychrome wooden coffered ceiling decorated with the coat of arms of the \u00c1lvarez de Toledo family and those of other families connected by marriage. A mirador (lookout point) was built onto the hall, as an internal balcony or loggia open to the air with four foliated Gothic arches. The exterior arch spandrels displayed three coats of arms, one being of the \u00c1lvarez family and the other two of the Z\u00fa\u00f1iga family. Plateresque details were added to the first palace in the 16th century. The Sierra de Gredos viewed from the Mirador de Do\u00f1a Elvira The building came to be known as the Palacio Do\u00f1a Elvira and the viewpoint as the Mirador de Do\u00f1a Elvira. The front of the building, and the viewpoint, faces the northwest and looks over the extensive flat valley of the Rio Ti\u00e9tar, which flows through the Campo Ara\u00f1uelo, and beyond that the fertile foothills of La Vera and the Sierra de Gredos.\nIn 1477 the \u00c1lvarez de Toledo male line was elevated from lords to counts by Isabel la Cat\u00f3lica as thanks for \u00c1lvarez support in the War of the Castilian Succession against Afonso V of Portugal. They became the Condado de Oropesa\u00a0 (Counts of Oropesa).\nThe New Palace\nIn the 16th century, th",
    "1945 United States Supreme Court case\nThomas Henry Robinson Jr. v. United States, 324 U.S. 282 (1945), was a Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that under the Federal Kidnapping Act which states, \"the sentence of death shall not be imposed by the court if, prior to its imposition, the kidnapped person has been liberated unharmed\", a defendant may receive the death sentence if their victim suffered from non-permanent injuries. Although the court ruled in this way, it did so mainly on the premise it did not feel it had sufficient reason to \"nullify the clearly expressed purpose of Congress\" in this case.\nHistorical context\nThis case begins with Thomas H. Robinson Jr, who, on October 10, 1934, kidnapped Alice Stoll in Louisville, Kentucky. In the commission of this kidnapping it was also alleged Robinson's father and wife were involved, however they were acquitted on all charges. Only 10 days later on October 20, a federal grand jury indicted Robinson with violating 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 408a and 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 408a (both statutes have been moved since).\nRobinson was then apprehended on May 11, 1936, in Glendale, California by the FBI and transported back to Kentucky to stand trial. On May 13, 1936, Robinson was arraigned, for \u00a7 408a only, and pled guilty to the singular count. Shackelford Miller Jr., a U.S District Judge for the Western District of Kentucky, sentenced Robinson to life imprisonment, and eventually was set to be served at the infamous Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. \nPre-retrial proceedings\nRobinson then, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the U.S. District Court for Northern California, which was denied. The stated reason for the writ because apparently wanted to bring to the Courts' attention the fact he was legally insane, and received ineffective assistance of counsel in his original trial. He appealed the decision the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which released it's opinion on April 8, 1941. In its opinion, written by Circuit Judge Curtis D. Wilbur, joined by Circuit Judge Francis A. Garrecht, the court affirmed the lower Court and denied Robinson's petition. It stated they did not believe Robinson's petition or motion had \"facts sufficient to entitle the petitioner to a writ\". Circuit Judge William Healy filed a dissenting opinion.\nRobinson then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari and eventually vacated the judgement of the Circuit Court, and remanded the case to order a new trial. In the Circuit Court's opinion on the matter, this time written by Judge Healy, Judge Wilbur dissented, pointing to his prior opinion on the matter as his reasoning. The case was remanded back to the California court on August 10, 1942, where, after a hearing, Judge Michael J. Roche determined that Robinson indeed had not \"intelligently waived\" his right to effective counsel, and thus ordered a retrial back in the Kentucky court.\nRetrial and appeal\nThe retrial of Robinson concluded in 1943, where he was ultimately convicted of kidnapping and ,upon recommendation from the jury, sentenced to death by Judge Miller. Robinson once again appealed, this time to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, this time finally on the matter of whether the death sentence was legal. Robinson argued that the kidnapping statute in question, specifically the provision on the death sentence, was a violation of the Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights. The section in question reads as follows:\n\"Whoever shall knowingly transport or cause to be transported, or aid or abet in transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce, any person who shall have been unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, kidnaped, abducted, or carried away by any means whatsoever and held for ransom or reward or otherwise, except, in the case of a minor, by a parent thereof, shall, upon conviction, be punished (1) by death if the verdict of the jury shall so recommend, provided that the sentence of death shall not be imposed by the court if, prior to its imposition, the kidnaped person has been liberated unharmed\" (emphasis as in original)\nRobinson argued that the italicized provision is too \"too vague, uncertain and indefinite to form the basis of a valid indictment\". He argued that, \"the phrase \"and did not liberate her unharmed\"  was too indefinite as a basis for the indictment; that the word \"harmed\" admits of varying degrees of \u00a0meaning from slight to grave\". He further argued that he had a right to know \"as to what particular injuries the Government would insist had been inflicted\". There were also raised concerns in regards to the jury, although this specific argument was denied by the Court. The Court further reviewed Robinson's claim that he was criminally insane, although that also was thrown out. Ultimately the court ruled against Robinson on July 31, 1944. Robinson subsequently appealed to the United States Supreme Court once more.\nSupreme Court\nThe Supre",

He confessed to 17 murders and was suspected to have committed upwards of 20. His victims were female hitchhikers, whom he robbed, sexually assaulted, and strangled in and around Krasnodar.\nBackground\nHaroyan was 32 years old at the time of his arrest. He was 2 meters (6'5\") tall, unmarried, and had worked as a driver for his entrepreneur father. He was deeply bothered by what he described as the \"immoral behavior\" of women and had been previously forced to undergo treatment at the Serbsky Center in Moscow for schizophrenia.\nMurders and imprisonment\nHaroyan committed his first murders in early 2000, when the bodies of strangled women began to appear around Krasnodar. His first two victims were students of the Kuban State Agrarian University. After offering his victims a ride home from work or university, he would give them an ultimatum: 100 to 200 rubles for sex, or he would murder them. Regardless of their choice, he would strangle them after sex and dump their bodies in bushes along the roadside, and in one instance, he lit the victim's remains on fire.\nOn 4 December 2001, law enforcement organized a team to investigate the murders. Haroyan was detained at one point but was released due to insufficient evidence.\nHis final victim was a 28-year-old lawyer. She was discovered asphyxiated on 2 March 2002, in a forest belt in the village of Znamensky. Four days later, Haroyan was apprehended due to a tip from someone who had witnessed the woman entering his white Volga. Haroyan told investigators that the woman was a friend of his father, whom he offered to give a ride home, and after an argument, had strangled her.\nDuring interrogation, Haroyan freely confessed to his crimes, describing them as a \"fight against the immoral behavior of females.\" Due to his mental instability, he was declared insane and sentenced to compulsory treatment at a psychiatric hospital, where he remained as of 2012.\nSee also\nYuri Sparikhin\nList of Russian serial killers\nNotes\n^ a b c Contrary to all other reports, the First Deputy Head of the Investigative Department of Krasnodar, Vadim Bugaenko, claimed Haroyan began killing in 1996.\n^ a b Some sources refer to him as Levan Vakhtangovich Aroyan (Russian: \u041b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0412\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0410\u0440\u043e\u044f\u043d).\n",

Until the village of Perperek it flows in southeastern direction in a wide sparsely forested. Downstream from the village the river takes a large bend to the southwest. Shortly before flowing into the Studen Kladenets Reservoir on the Arda at an altitude of 227\u00a0m, the river forms a gorge between the elevations of Kartalkaya (563\u00a0m) to the west and Yumrukkaya (587\u00a0m) to the east, which is now almost flooded by the reservoir. It drains the ridges of Chukata and Kayadzhik.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 220\u00a0km2, or 3.8% of the Arda's total. The river has predominantly rain feed.

In April 1977, he won the 200 butterfly with a time of 1:47.85 at the National AAU Indoor Short Course Championships in Canton, Ohio.\nIn 1976, he qualified for the Olympic trials in Long Beach in the 200-meter butterfly, but placed sixth in the finals with a time of 2:02.88.\nUniversity of California\nThornton swam for the University of California Berkeley from 1977 to 1980, where he received All American honors twice and was a national champion. His father, who coached him in college, was International Swimming Hall of Fame Coach Nort Thornton, a highly accomplished Head Coach for the University of California Berkeley from 1974 to 2000.  Richard specialized in the 100 and 200 butterfly and the 200 freestyle.  He graduated Berkeley in 1980 which a Bachelor's in Physical Education, and began his coaching career after earning a master's degree at St. Mary's. \nAt 21, he was selected for the United States Olympic Team, but did not participate as an Olympian, as the United States had boycotted the Moscow Olympics that year due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\nCoaching\nThornton had a long and distinguished coaching career with the San Ramon Valley Aquatics from 1984 to 2004. He helped co-found the year round swim program in 1984, which now has a staff of several coaches, an executive board, and added a Masters Program for Adult swimmers in 2012.  As of 2024, the team meets at the large San Ramon Olympic Pool and Park on Broadmoor Drive, and also the Dougherty Valley Aquatic Center, built in 2007, on Albion Drive in San Ramon.  Both facilities have outdoor Olympic size pools which can be used for meets or practices.\nNationally recognized for his skills and his team's accomplishments, Thornton was a recipient of the American Swimming Coaches Association Award of Excellence from 1988 to 1994.  He was also the recipient of the Pacific Swimming Coach of the Year award from 1994 to 2000.\nOn the international level, Thornton served as head coach for the 1995 U.S. World Championship team.  In high level age group competition, he served as coach for American national and junior national teams in Paris, Japan and Brazil.\nOutstanding swimmers coached\nThe most outstanding swimmer to come through his swim program at San Ramon was Matt Biondi, who swam for the club from 1990 to 1992. He was a U.S. Olympic team member in 1984, 1988, and 1992, and captured eight gold, two silver, and one bronze medal.  Thornton also coached 2008  Olympic breaststroke swimmer for Brazil Henrique Barbosa from 2001 to 2002, and Pan American Games gold medalist in 2007, as well as 2007 Pan Am Games Gold medalist and Stanford swim team Captain Andy Grant from 2001 to 2004.  He coached Stanford swimmer Pan Pacific Championships gold medalist Sarah Anderson from 1990 to 1995, and 1988 Olympic finalist for Czechoslovakia, Alex Marcek from 1990 to 1992.  The club also produced a number of Olympic trail qualifiers and collegiate All Americans.  Attendees at the 2004 Olympic trials included Leah Avilla, who Thornton coached from 1994-2005, John Dorr who Thornton coached from 1994-2002, and Amy Ng who Thornton coached from 1992-2001.\nA surfing enthusiast, Thornton died after collapsing while heading to the water to surf at \"The Hook\", a popular surfing location near Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz, California on January 4, 2024.  He had been suffering from Multiple Myloma, a blood disease.  Drowning was later determined as the cause of death.  He was 65.\n",
    "Societ scientist\nLuarsab Sharashidze (18 January 1923, Tbilisi, Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic - 7 February 1991, Tbilisi) was a Georgian physician, academic, pathologist, morphologist, and a pioneer of Cytochemistry and Histochemistry in Georgia. He was one of the principal developers and contributor of the Georgian Medical Healthcare system. He was the founder and director of the First Scientific Research and Clinical Centre of Oncology in Georgia. Internationally renowned Georgian academic and diagnostic cancer pathologist. Educator of many generations of Georgian and Soviet medical scientists, author of 10 monographs and 300 scientific works, project leader of 78 Phd and Doctorate theses, Honorary and Meritorious member of Georgian Academy of Sciences (1984). Sharashidze's notable scientific research discoveries in Experimental Oncology were included in the Great Medical Encyclopedia of USSR. He is the one and only Georgian and Soviet scientist who participated in all international symposiums and congresses of Cytochemistry and Histochemistry worldwide.\nLuarsab Sharashidze had 50 years of scientific and teaching experience in pathology, morphology, cyto-histochemistry and oncology.\nChildhood and early education\nLuarsab Sharashidze was born on 18 January 1923 in Tbilisi. His father, Kalistrate Sharashidze was a physician and general practitioner. His mother, Ekaterine Pkhakadze, was a teacher of Russian Language and Literature.\nIn 1930, Sharashidze entered Tbilisi First Secondary School, where he graduated with honors diploma in 1939. From 1939 to 1946 Sharashidze studied medicine and surgery at Tbilisi State Medical Institute and graduated with First Honors degree.\nDuring the 4th year of his medical course, at the age of 20, on the recommendation of head of pathology department Academician V. Zhgenti, Sharashidze was appointed as a senior laboratory assistant at the same departement. It was the first and only precedent in the history of Georgian Medical Institute, when fourth-year medical student taught Pathology to the thirdyear medical students.\nFrom 1946 to 1949 he did his postgraduate course in Pathology and became PhD of medicine.\nScientific research and achievements\nFrom 1951 to 1956, Sharashidze was head of the Patho-Morphological department of the Tbilisi Scientific-Research Institute of Tuberculosis. In 1951, Sharashidze introduced the latest methods of neuro-morphological research to the department and In 1952\u20131953, he proved scientifically that the emergence, localization, course and outcome of tuberculosis depended directly on the condition of the innervation mechanisms. In 1954, he established the possibility of obtaining non-pathogenic strains of the microbe; He successfully Identified these forms of human actinomycosis, leading to the development of the new vaccines of the disease. Sharashidze's discovery was of considerable importance and was included in the Great Medical Encyclopedia of USSR.\nIn 1956, at the age of 33, he introduced novel cytochemical research methods in Georgia: tetrazone reaction (to identify aromatic amino acids), DDD reaction (to identify the thiol group of proteins) and Schiff-iodic acid reaction. In 1957, for the first time in Georgia, he founded the Department of Cyto-histochemistry in the Scientific-Research Institute of Experimental and Clinical Surgery of Georgia, which he led until 1973. During this period, the results of his scientific research work conducted in this department were published in international medical journals and medical manuals, leading to his renown both within and outside the USSR.\nIn 1958, Sharashidze was the first to use absorption microphotometry to determine the amount of nucleic acids and proteins by means of the \"MUF-5\" device. In 1959, he published the first practical manual in cytohistochemistry. In 1960, aged 37, he was the first Georgian scientist to present the results of cytochemical research at the USSR Congress of Pathomorphologists in Kharkiv in 1959 and later on at the First World Congress of Cytohistochemistry in Paris in 1960.\nIn 1960 L. Sharashidze defended his doctoral thesis and in 1963 he was awarded the title of professor in the field of pathology and morphology. In 1960, for the first time in Georgia, he published a monograph on Cytohistochemistry of Cancer. In 1962, he was elected as a member of the Cytology Commission under the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and in 1963 as a member of the national committee in CytoHistochemistry at the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. He was a member of the Council of the Society of Oncologists of the Soviet Union, a member of the Scientific Council of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Oncology, a member of the editorial board of the All union journal \u00ab\u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b \u041e\u043d\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438\u00bb.\nIn 1964, for the first time in Georgia, he organised the 1st Union Symposium on Cytohistochemistry of Cancer.

    "\nThe Battle of point 5140 was fought on 20 June 1999 and was major military offensive carried out by the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles regiment as a part of the Operation Vijay (Kargil War). The Indian forces under Lt Col. Yogesh Kumar Joshi were able to capture the point.\nOverview\nThe task of capturing Point 5140, a strategically important mountain peak in the Dras sector, was assigned to 13 JAK Rif under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Yogesh Kumar Joshi on 17 June 1999. After the capture of Rocky Knob, located at the base of Point 5140 and about 800 metres away, Humps IX and X (part of Hump Complex, consisting of about ten high grounds numbered I to X on the same ridgeline about 500\u2013700 metres north of Point 4590) on 17 June, the battalion's commanding officer, Joshi, fell back to Tololing, and started planning for their next objective \u2014 Point 5140. Point 5140, about 1500 metres north of Tololing on the same ridgeline, is at an altitude of 16,962 feet above sea level and overlooks the Tololing nullah. It is the highest point on the Tololing ridgeline and the most formidable feature in the Dras sub-sector.\nOn 18 June, the battalion carried out a detailed reconnaissance of Point 5140 which revealed the enemy had put in place seven sangars on the feature; two on the top, four towards the east and one towards the north. It also revealed the eastern approach to the feature was comparatively easier than that from the front, which had a near vertical climb, dominated by the top, though it was also more heavily defended. It was decided the assaulting troops must capture the Top before dawn, or else the enemy would inflict maximum casualties on them.\nJoshi decided to attack Point 5140 with Bravo Company, under the command of Lieutenant Sanjeev Singh Jamwal, and Delta Company, under the command of Lieutenant Vikram Batra, from two sides; East and South. At the Hump Complex, Sanjeev Jamwal and Vikram received their briefing about the mission from Joshi. During the briefing, Jamwal chose the words \"Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!\" to be the success signal for his company whilst Vikram chose the words \"Yeh Dil Mange More!\" (This heart wants more! \u2014 from a popular advertising slogan of Pepsi) as his success signal for his company. D-Day was set for 19 June, and H-Hour at 20:30.\nUnder the cover of artillery fire, the two assault companies began climbing Point 5140 after midnight on 20 June. The artillery at Hump Complex had already begun its preparatory bombardment of Point 5140. As planned, the artillery guns would stop firing when the troops were 200\u00a0metres short of the objective.\nOnce the artillery guns, including the MBRLs and 105\u00a0mm guns, had ceased firing, the Pakistani soldiers immediately came out of their bunkers and put down heavy fire with their machine guns on the advancing Indian soldiers. At that moment, both Jamwal and Batra, contacted commanders at the base via radio, asking to continue artillery bombardment of the enemy positions till the companies were 100\u00a0metres from their target.\nBy 0315 hours, both B and D Companies had reached the vicinity of Point 5140 despite the treacherous terrain. B company reached the top of the feature first and assaulted from the left flank. By 0330 hours, B company had captured its objective, and at 0335 hours Jamwal radioed his command post, saying the words \"Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!\"\nBatra decided to approach the hill from the rear, aiming to surprise the enemy, and to cut off their withdrawal route. Batra fired three rockets towards the bunkers on the east side of the feature, before attacking them. He and his men ascended the sheer rock-cliff, but as the group neared the top, the enemy pinned them on the face of the bare cliff with machine gun fire. Batra, along with five of his men, climbed up and after reaching the top, hurled two grenades at the machine gun post. Batra then killed three enemy soldiers single-handedly in close combat. He was seriously injured in the process, but insisted on regrouping his men to continue with the mission. He continued to lead his troops, and then charged at the next enemy position, capturing Point 5140. In all its actions, his company killed at least eight Pakistani intruders and recovered a heavy anti-aircraft machine gun. The remaining enemy soldiers fled.\nAt 0435 hours, Batra radioed his command post, saying the words \"Yeh dil mange more!\". Considerable quantities of arms and ammunition were recovered from the feature. The captured munitions indicated the enemy's strength was about a platoon. Neither B or D companies suffered any casualties in the battle. The capture of Point 5140 set in motion a string of successes, such as the captures of Point 5100, Point 4700, Junction Peak and the Three Pimple Complex.\nAftermath\nAfter the capture of Point 5140, Batra was promoted to the rank of captain. General Ved Prakash Malik, the then Chief of Army Staff, called to congratulate him. All across the nation, his triumph was being played out on television s",
    "\nGiovanni Dario (Latin: Johannes Darius, Greek: \u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2; 1414\u20131494) was a Venetian official who served multiple times as ambassador of the Republic of Venice. His family hailed from Crete, a Venetian colony at the time; his knowledge of Greek allowed him to serve as interpreter and envoy to Constantinople during the last years of the Byzantine Empire. After the Fall of Constantinople he rose to the position of secretary of the Duke of Crete, and from 1464 entered service with the Signoria of Venice. He was repeatedly sent as ambassador to the court of the Ottoman Empire and the Mamluk Sultanate, most notably helping conclude the First Ottoman\u2013Venetian War in 1479.\nLife\nEarly life\nGiovanni Dario was born in 1414 to a Venetian family established in Kastelli Pediadas on Crete; His father, Marco, was a merchant who often travelled abroad, to Venice and Constantinople, often accompanied by his brother, Giovanni, and eventually by his own sons, Giovanni and Zaccaria, and their brother-in-law, Giorgio Pantaleo. By 1450, Giovanni began his career in the Venetian administration as a notary; although noted for his excellent command of both Greek and Latin, he failed to be appointed chancellor of Chania (Canea). Nevertheless, from August of the same year he served as interpreter to Niccol\u00f2 da Canal during the latter's embassy to the Byzantine imperial court in Constantinople, and then to the Despotate of the Morea. In 1451 he unsuccessfully competed for the post of chancellor in Siteia (Sitia), and then Rethymno (Retimo).\nDario's life during the next years is obscure. A later tradition, which however is not supported by any available evidence, holds that during the Fall of Constantinople he was the unnamed Italian who along with the famous humanist Cyriacus of Ancona is said to have accompanied Sultan Mehmed II, reading to him from the works of ancient historians. This tradition has been disproven, not least since Cyriacus was noted for his anti-Ottoman stance and was likely dead by 1453; but it is likely true that Dario and Cyriacus were acquainted and present together at Constantinople some time before 1453, as Cyriacus is connected with a sketch, drawn by Dario, of the equestrian statue surmounting the Column of Justinian that is now in the University of Budapest library. In 1458 Dario is attested in Crete as chancellor of the island's captain, Angelo Gradenigo, in 1460 as a notary of the great council of Crete, and likely again in 1463\u201364, when he corresponded with his friend, the scholar Michael Apostolius, who had settled in Crete after the Fall of Constantinople.\nMove to Venice and diplomatic career\nPainting of a Venetian embassy to the Mamluk governor of Damascus, workshop of Giovanni Bellini\nFrom 1464 on, Dario resided in Venice, where he could better pursue his ambitions, entering the service of the Signoria of Venice; he even did not take up the position of chancellor of Chania to which he was appointed in 1466, partly due to the plague ravaging Crete at the time. In 1470  he was inscribed among the notaries of the Avogadoria de Com\u00f9n, but he also began his diplomatic carrer, being sent as part of an embassy of Triadano Gritti to Milan to mediate in the dispute between the Duke of Milan and the Duke of Modena over possession of Correggio. On his return from Milan, Dario was sent to Constantinople as part of Niccol\u00f2 Cocco's embassy seeking to conclude a peace in the  ongoing war between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. He resisted returning to Venice until ordered to do so in 1471, was in Crete in early 1472, and back in Venice in August/September.\nIn 1473 Dario was entrusted for the first time with leading an embassy himself, to the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, on the occasion of the imprisonment of Venetian merchants and the local Venetian consul at Damascus. The mission was a success, and Dario managed to conclude a treaty of friendship with the Mamluks. As the negotiations for a peace with the Ottomans continued without success, in late 1474 Dario and Gerolamo Zorzi were sent to the Ottoman sultan and brought back terms to Venice. In August 1477, after new incidents with the Mamluks, Dario was sent to Egypt again.\nConclusion of peace with the Ottomans\nDario's skill was recognized by the Great Council of Venice, and in May 1478 he was recommended to assist the provveditore d'armata Tommaso Malipiero in his negotiations with the Ottomans on his return from Egypt, but Dario did not return to Italy until June 1478. Nevertheless, as Malipiero managed to come to terms with the Ottoman pasha of Rumelia, on 18 November the Venetian Senate granted Dario extensive powers and sent him as ambassador to the Ottoman court, at Constantinople or Adrianople, in order to confirm the agreement. Venice's need to conclude peace was pressing, and this was reflected in Dario's instructions: he was given permission to accede to any demands Mehmed II might make, in exchange for restoring the Republic's access to the Levantin",
    "Pratt Cates Remmel (born Little Rock, Arkansas, October 26, 1915; died May 14, 1991) was an American politician, businessman, and public servant. He is best known for serving two terms as the mayor of Little Rock (1952\u20131956), the first Republican elected to the office since 1887, and for his run for governor of Arkansas in 1954 against Orval Faubus.\nEarly life and family\nThe Remmel family was deeply involved in Republican party politics in Arkansas. Pratt Remmel's great uncle Harmon L. Remmel, a businessman and banker, was first a lieutenant of party boss Powell Clayton and then, from about 1913 to his death in 1927, controlled the party himself. Pratt Remmel's father Augustus C. Remmel (1882\u20131920) was a leader of the \"Lily-white movement\" among Arkansas Republicans and sometimes clashed with his uncle; he was chairman of the state Republican committee at the time of his death at the age of 38. His mother Ellen \"Nell\" (Cates) Remmel (1888\u20131961) served on the national Republican committee for many years.\nPratt Remmel's father died when he was five years old; he and his five brothers and sisters were raised by their mother. Remmel graduated from Little Rock High School in 1933 and went on to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, earning a BA in economics there in 1937.\nPolitical career\nReturning to Arkansas, Remmel immediately entered politics, running unsuccessfully for the Little Rock city council in 1938. In 1940 he became  a member of the Pulaski County Republican Party executive committee, the first of many positions he was to hold in the Arkansas Republican Party. On June 15, 1940, he married Catherine Crouch (1918\u20132006), daughter of powerful Arkansas businessman Harvey C. Couch.\nAfter serving as a Navy flight instructor during World War II and building an insurance business after the war, Remmel ran for mayor of Little Rock in 1951 and trounced two-term Democratic mayor Sam Wassell, who had broken local tradition by running for a third term. Remmel was re-elected in 1953.\nRemmel was the Republican candidate for governor in 1954, losing to Orval Faubus. Remmel received almost 38% of the vote, which was a very good showing for a Republican at the time; the 1952 nominee, Jefferson Speck, had managed only 12.5% against Democrat Francis Cherry, while the 1956 nominee, Roy Mitchell, collected 19.3% against Faubus.\nRemmel ran for mayor of Little Rock again in 1955, losing narrowly to Democrat Woodrow Wilson Mann.\nLater activities\nAfter his terms as mayor Remmel did not run for elected office again, but he took on volunteer roles with the American Legion and American Red Cross, as well as serving on the Arkansas River Basin Commission and as chairman of the Arkansas Waterways Commission, a state advisory committee intended to promote navigation on Arkansas rivers.\nFamily\nRemmel and his wife Catherine had at least three children, Pratt Remmel Jr., Rebecca Remmel, and Catherine Ellen Remmel Matthews (1941\u20132020), who became a successful real estate agent and marketing expert and also led the Department of Arkansas Heritage from 1997 to 2002.\n",

    "Mayor (1794-1873)\nCharles Smith Hempstead (Sep. 10, 1794 - Dec. 10, 1874) was a businessman, lawyer, and mayor from the U.S. State of Illinois. He is credited for serving as the first mayor of the city of Galena in Jo Daviess County. He was a promoter of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad and was the younger brother of Missouri Territory House Representative Edward Hempstead.\nBiography\nCharles was born in Hebron, Connecticut on September 10, 1794 from American Revolutionary War veteran Stephen Hempstead Sr. and his mother Marry Lewis. In 1809 at the age of fifteen he left his school at the New London Academy in Forest, Virginia for St. Louis. After his arrival he would study law for many years under his elder brother and House Representative Edward Hempstead, until his death in 1817 from a horse accident, aged 37.\nIn the 1820s and 1830s Charles traveled throughout Illinois and the Missouri Territory before settling in Galena, IL. In January, 1834 he married Eliza Barnes and they had two children. By April 26, 1841 Galena was granted its charter. During that same period on May 24th a mayoral election was held by the board of trustees in which three candidates ran. Charles, H. H. Gear, and Daniel Wann. The results showed a turnout of 356 voters, of which Charles received 185, resulting in him becoming Galena's first mayor. He would serve until 1845.\nBefore his mayoral term, in 1840 Charles became an attorney partner with Harvard Law School graduate Elihu B. Washburne up until Washburne was elected to serve as a congressman for Illinois in 1852.\nWhen the American Civil War broke out Charles was given the position of Assistant Paymaster of the Army by President Abraham Lincoln in 1861. He would work under Paymaster-General of the United States Army Timothy Andrews and Benjamin Brice until the wars end. In addition, let it be known that despite Charles support for the  Northern Union, he had a mixed view on slavery and may have taken the position as a business venture instead of a moral service.\nPortrait, 1878\nCharles spent the rest of his days in Galena as a prominent lawyer and member of the Early Settler's Association until his death on December 10, 1874 at age 80. His law and business partner Elihu B. Washburne had this to say about his passing in a letter from January 15, 1875. \"I have felt it to be fitting that a tribute should be paid to the memory of a man who was a connecting link with the age gone by, and whose career was so interwoven not only with the history of our immediate locality, but with the earlier settlement of the west and northwest.\"\nLegacy\nCharles left an everlasting effect in Galena and Jo Daviess County, his original home and office still stands near the city's downtown and the Galena River at 611 South Bench Street.  The Hempstead family among other local historical figures are a prominent part of the Galena Historical Society's annual cemetery walk since 1994.\n",
    "Greek railway station\nMarasia railway station (Greek: \u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1, romanized:\u00a0Sidirodromiki stasi Marasia) is a small unstaffed\nrailway station that serves the village of Marasia, Evros, in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Located just north of the settlement, Today Hellenic Train operates just two daily regional trains to Alexandroupoli.\nHistory\nThe railway was an important link during World War I as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary were all Central Allies. After the Ottoman Empire's defeat, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi) in Turkey serving Edirne Karaaga\u00e7 station and for 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi) between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (CFFH), a subsidiary of the CO, when the CFFH was incorporated in July 1929.\nUnder the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, which had the result that the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entered Greece at Pythio, then re-entered Turkey at Edirne (Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 railway station), re-entered Greece at Marasia, and finally entered Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad.  This arrangement continued until 1971 when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed through Feres. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE taking over responsibilities for most for Greece's rail infrastructure.\nAt the same time, in 1971, SEK designed and constructed a 9\u00a0km (5.6\u00a0mi) direct connection between Nea Vyssa and Marasia within the Greek borders, thus avoiding Turkish territory and bypassing Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 and with a new intermediate station at Kastanies.\nIn the 1990s, OSE introduced the InterCity service to the Alexandroupoli\u2013Svilengrad line Which reduced travel times across the whole line.\nin 2017, limerted works where carreid out at the station, the buildings where painted, and the platform was paved.\nIn 2020 it was announced that the section of line between Pythio and Ormenio was to be upgraded, at the cost of \u20ac1.4 million as part of an ambitious integrated intergovernmental transport plan which will see this, and 39 other transport sector projects be built, with financing from the European Commission with a total of \u20ac117\u00a0million. The package of measures aims to build or improve transport connections and connectivity across Europe, with a focus on sustainable transport. The project for the Pythian-Ormenio section envisions upgrading the existing line infrastructure and trackbed, doubling of the track as well as the installation of electrification signalling (ETCS Level 1) along the entire stretch, with the aim of improving freight transport with Bulgaria and Turkey.\nFacilities\nThe station is housed in a small 1970s building that houses a waiting shelter. Beside this, the station has no other facilities. The platform, which is long for this region, has no outside seating, Dot-matrix display departure and arrival screens, nor timetable poster boards for passenger information; the station remains little more than an unstaffed halt.\nServices\nAs of 2020, the stop is only served by one daily pair of regional trains Alexandroupoli\u2013Ormenio. There are currently no services to Svilengrad.\nLine layout\n",

    "Walls in Thomery, Historical monument\nThe Chemin des Longs Sillons is a group of high walls specific to the commune of Thomery in the Seine-et-Marne region, built in the first third of the 18th century to grow table grapes of a local variety known as \u201cChasselas de Thomery\u201d. Since 1993, they have been listed as Historic Monuments (MH) in the Seine-et-Marne MH list.\nDescription\nMost of the village of Thomery and the former commune of By now merged with Thomery, are crisscrossed by high walls, spaced 9 to 10 meters apart and up to 100 meters long, which follow the natural slope of the Thomery hillside down to the Seine. These 2.50 to 3-meter-high walls, made of stones held together with earth mortar, were erected for Thomery's particular espalier grape-growing technique, to restore as much heat as possible to the vines grown in this very northerly area for table grapes.\nThe Chemin des Longs Sillons is a public footpath 645 meters long and 3 to 5 meters wide, lined with these high grape walls, winding between the private gardens of the lieux-dits des Longs-Sillons, des Merisiers-Coquins, des Renti\u00e8res, and des Folies. There is also another path of this type, but not listed, called the \u201csentier rural des Grands-Clos\u201d, in the lower part of Thomery, running alongside the rue du 4-Septembre.\nHistory\nA modern-day Thomeryon wall with Chasselas.\nThe first walls were built around 1730, followed by a second major wave in 1840 with the success of vine growing and the increase in grape production in the second half of the nineteenth century. At their peak around 1850, these walls totaled more than 250 km in length, with vineyards covering more than 205 hectares. Today, however, they are far fewer in number and the vast majority of them have no vines, serving as cadastral boundaries between the plots of private homes built in the 20th century with the decline in Chasselas production.Walls in By around 1900-1910.To preserve this rural agricultural and technical heritage, on May 5, 1993, the Monuments Historiques registered the walls within the perimeter defined by rue de la R\u00e9publique, rue Victor-Hugo, rue de By and rue des Montforts as a remarkable agricultural ensemble, representing a rectangle of approximately 500 meters in length and 150 meters in width.

    "Football club\nNiederschlesische Fu\u00dfballverein Gelb-Wei\u00df G\u00f6rlitz (English: Lower Silesian Football Club Yellow-White G\u00f6rlitz) is a German football club from G\u00f6rlitz, in the Lower Silesian Upper Lusatia. The home ground of the club, which has 250 members, is the Junge Welt Stadium (English: Young World Stadium).\nHistory\nGelb-Wei\u00df G\u00f6rlitz was founded in 1909 as Sportclub Wanderslust. By 1910, the club was renamed Fu\u00dfballclub Union. With the establishment of an athletics department in 1913, the club competed under the name Sportclub Union.\nSpVgg Gelb-Wei\u00df G\u00f6rlitz was established in 1923 when the football department of ATV 1847 G\u00f6rlitz\u00a0 separated from the gymnastics club and formed an independent club as part of the \"clean separations\" ordered by the umbrella associations. Major games were played at Schenkendorffplatz in the part of the city which is now part of Poland (current venue of the club Nysa Zgorzelec\u00a0). In 1914, the club moved to its own field on the corner of Reichenbacher Stra\u00dfe/Kaiserring (today Rosa-Luxemburg-Stra\u00dfe), which was demolished during World War I. In 1928, 1931, and 1932, the club, now based in the Gro\u00df Biesnitz neighbourhood, became Upper Lusatian champions and thus qualified for the participation in the south-east German finals. In 1933, Gelb-Wei\u00df G\u00f6rlitz failed to qualify for the newly introduced Silesian Gauliga and subsequently played in the second-tier Lower Silesian Bezirksliga. By finishing 1st in group 2 of the 1940\u201341  Bezirksliga Niederschlesien, G\u00f6rlitz qualified for the district championship final, which they lost to WSV Liegnitz, but were however promoted to the newly created Lower Silesian Gauliga. However, G\u00f6rlitz withdrew completely from competitive play in the first Gauliga season, the 1941\u201342 Gauliga Niederschlesien.\nIn 1945, the club was revived as SG G\u00f6rlitz-West west of the Lusatian Neisse river. Subsequently, the club was renamed SG Vorw\u00e4rts G\u00f6rlitz from 1948 and BSG Motor G\u00f6rlitz from 1951. The conditions for football improved with the involvement of the local enterprise called \"Waggonbau G\u00f6rlitz\". In 1958, G\u00f6rlitz achieved promotion to the II. DDR-Liga. In the first season, promotion was narrowly missed, finishing behind Chemnitzer FC. After a total of four seasons in the third tier of the East German pyramid, BSG Motor WAMA G\u00f6rlitz, as the club was known from 1965, mostly played at the regional level in the Dresden district leagues. In 1965 and 1977, the club was promoted to the DDR-Liga. However, G\u00f6rlitz found this level too challenging and was relegated back to the Bezirksliga Dresden along with Fortschritt Wei\u00dfenfels and Dynamo L\u00fcbben in both years.\nAfter the reunification, NSV Gelb-Wei\u00df G\u00f6rlitz was re-founded on 2 July 1991. They played in the Bezirksliga Dresden from 1991 to 2000 for ten years. On 1 January 1, 1999, the football department separated from the parent NSV and has since played as NFV Gelb-Wei\u00df G\u00f6rlitz. In 2000 they won promotion to the Landesliga Sachsen.\nIn September 2016, NFV Gelb-Wei\u00df G\u00f6rlitz withdrew its first team from Landesliga operations with immediate effect and thus became the first relegated club of the 2016\u201317 season. The reasons for this were investigations against the board and the arrest of two foreign players who were officially eligible to play.\nHonours and achievements\n3x Participation in the DDR-Liga: 1965\u201366, 1977\u201378\n4x Participation in the II.

    "\nPiatti Ristorante, also known as Piatti, is a small restaurant chain located along the West Coast and in Texas. It is known for offering a range of authentic Italian cuisine and wines. For the last 33 years Piatti has catered their dining experience to both small groups and large private events.\nPiatti is owned by Palisades Hospitality Group.\nLocation\nThe first Piatti was established in La Jolla, California in 1990. Soon after, 6 additional restaurants were opened. As of 2013 there are now restaurants in Sacramento, Danville, Mill Valley and, Seattle Washington and two Piattis in San Antonino Texas. Each restaurant features the same classic dishes, but the decor and menu is customized to each location in order to include both local and Italian elements. Managers and chefs are given the freedom to change/ the Piatti restaurant spaces and menus based on the city where they are established. In a 2015 interview done by the San Francisco Business Times, while talking about the designs of the restaurants, Tim Harmon argued that \"people want to feel like the restaurant they're going to is unique to the area and special and I think that's only continuing to grow ... being able to deliver that is critical to ongoing success.\"\nHistory\nThe word Piatti is plural for the word \"piatto,\" the Italian word for plates/platters.

    "Historic cemetery in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, United States\nLewisburg Cemetery is a historic cemetery in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. Located immediately to the north of Bucknell University, and dating to 1848, it is a contributing site of the Lewisburg Historic District. There are around 13,000 burials in the cemetery.\nThe cemetery is bounded by South 7th Street to the east (from which is the only entrance), St. Catharine Street to the north, and South Derr Drive (U.S. Route 15) to the west. (St. Catharine Street is now disjointed, its layout having been altered after the cemetery's expansions. A separate section continues east to South 6th Street at Hufnagle Park.)\nHistory\nUpon completion of the cemetery's boundaries of its original 6 acres (2.4\u00a0ha), interments from other graveyards in the town, and from Crossroads Church in nearby Buffalo Township, were moved here. As such, several early settlers of Union County, including veterans of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, are interred here. The McClure Monument, dating to around 1833, was removed to the cemetery from the graveyard of the Presbyterian Church on Market Street (Pennsylvania Route 45). One of the oldest burials is that of Martha Wilson, a child who died in 1788.\nThe original cemetery is located off to the right, well beyond the end of the paved Chapel Lane, once inside the main gate. It includes three family burial circles along a path that is wide enough to support horse-drawn hearses. The iron gate on South 7th Street, at the head of the eastern section of St. Catharine Street, would have accommodated them. The iron fence was installed in 1886.\nInside the gate there formerly stood a two-story arched gatehouse, where the cemetery's sexton lived. The gatehouse was moved to today's 638 and 640 St. George Street in 1892. Its archway has since been filled in.\nThe cemetery was expanded to around 12 acres (4.9\u00a0ha) in 1878. It is 38 acres (15\u00a0ha) today.\nMany of the cemetery's headstones were carved, in Quincy granite, by stonemason Chauncey Foster, including that of his wife, Enna, who died in 1908. He was buried beside her and their four children upon his death eleven years later. Foster's workshop was on South 4th Street.\nThe cemetery's chapel was built in 1899. The columbarium and fountain in front of the chapel was added in 2012. The cemetery's vault was built at the same time as the chapel. It is now unused, since graves are dug with machinery.\nA mausoleum, for above-ground burials, is located near the cemetery's entrance. It was built in 2009.\nThe Lewisburg Cemetery Association was incorporated when the cemetery first opened. The association's president is Kathy Lentz, who succeeded Nancy Neuman.\nIn 2023, to celebrate the 175th anniversary of the cemetery's establishment, tours were held.\nThe cemetery is site 9 on Bucknell University's \"Poetry Path\".\nNotable burials\nGeorge Ripley Bliss (1816-1893), twice president of Bucknell University\nJustin Rolph Loomis (1810-1898), president of Bucknell University\nChristy Mathewson (1880\u20131925), Major League Baseball player\nMerle Middleton Odgers (1900-1983), president of Bucknell University\nRobert Levi Rooke (1891\u20131994), benefactor of Bucknell University\n",

    "Alonso Ignacio Benito Espinosa (1720\u20131786) was a Jesuit missionary to New Spain.\nBiography\nEspinosa was born on February 1, 1720, in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria. He was ordained at age twenty-one in M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, and subsequently moved to Michoac\u00e1n. After recovering from a serious illness during a visit to Guanajuato, Espinosa entered the Society of Jesus on August 14, 1750. He completed his novitiate on August 15, 1752, and was assigned to the Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert.\nIn May 1754, Espinosa was assigned to Mission La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Caborca. He traveled there together with Governor Pablo de Arce y Arroyo\u00a0 and Father Visitor Carlos de Roxas, but returned to San Ignacio due both to his poor health and to unrest among the Caborca natives. In June, the provincial superior, Joseph de Utrera, reassigned Espinosa to Mission San Xavier del Bac. The residence there was not yet complete, so Espinosa relocated temporarily to the nearby Mission Los Santos \u00c1ngeles de Guevavi.\nEarly in 1756, Espinosa moved into the mission in Bac, where he attempted to suppress native rituals involving ceremonial dance and intoxication. This provoked unrest among the natives, and that October, native leader Jabanim\u00f3 led an uprising at the mission. Espinosa escaped to Presidio San Ignacio de Tubac, and Lieutenant Juan Mar\u00eda de Oliva led a force of 15 soldiers to Bac and put down the rebellion. Subsequently, Governor Juan Antonio de Mendoza\u00a0 and Captain Francisco El\u00edas Gonzalez led a punitive expedition, which reinstalled Espinosa at Bac and fought Jabanim\u00f3 by the Gila River.\nEspinosa continued to have poor success at San Xavier del Bac. In the winter of 1760, he reported that nearly all the natives had abandoned the mission. There was insufficient water, and the livestock suffered from Apache raids. About 1763, construction was finished on the new church which had been underway since 1756. Espinosa's health was poor, and he spent the winter of 1764 in San Ignacio under the care of Francisco Xavier Pauer. He returned to Bac, but by spring he was bedbound with an infected leg. In the summer of 1765, the provincial superior, Manuel Aguirre, assigned Jos\u00e9 Neve to replace Espinosa at Bac. Espinosa was too sick to be moved, and spent another year assisting Neve after recovering, but eventually he went on to serve at Mission Los Siete Pr\u00edncipes del \u00c1til.\nAt the time of the 1767 Jesuit Expulsion, he was once again in Caborca. Along with about fifty other Jesuits, Espinosa was escorted to a church in M\u00e1tape, near Hermosillo. From there, the soldiers took them to Guaymas, across the Gulf of Mexico, through Tepic, and to Guadalajara. Many of the Jesuits died on the way, but a few, including Espinosa, survived to reach C\u00e1diz in Spain. Espinosa went on to spend the last seventeen years of his life in the Monastery of Yuste, and died on September 21, 1786.\n",
    "Municipal building in Clare, Suffolk, England\nClare Town Hall is a municipal building in the town of Clare, Suffolk, in England. The building is currently used as a community events venue.\nHistory\nThe first building on the site was a structure known as the market cross which dated from the 16th century. There were two rooms on the first floor of the building, which were endowed by the local tradesman and philanthropist, William Cadge of Bochards Farm, and made available for use as a free school in 1668.\nBy the early 1830s, the market cross was dilapidated, and civic leaders decided to commission a corn exchange for the town. The new building, designed by James Fenner, was completed in 1838. The use of the building as a corn exchange declined significantly in the wake of the Great Depression of British Agriculture in the late 19th century.\nIn the early 20th century, civic leaders decided that the old corn exchange should be demolished and replaced by a town hall for community use, as part of the celebrations for the coronation of George V. The structure was rebuilt in brick with a cement render finish, to a design by Percy Monroe Beaumont, at cost \u00a31,317, and then re-opened as a town hall in 1913. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto Market Hill. The outer bays contained doorways flanked by pilasters surmounted by brackets supporting cornices. The central bay was fenestrated by five-part mullioned windows on both floors and there was extensive half-timbering installed in the gable above. St Edmundsbury Borough Council have described the structure as \"a unique building... of a traditional style with the front elevation of render and dark stained timber with a large overhanging gable\".  It is the only building on Market Hill in the town which is not listed.\nInternally, the principal room was an assembly hall, which was 45.3 feet (13.8\u00a0m) long and 33 feet (10\u00a0m) wide, featured a sprung dance floor, and had seating capacity of 300 people; there were various rooms for council meetings. The building was primarily used for parish level meetings; the local rural district council was based at Stonehall in Nethergate Street.\nExtensive alterations to main frontage, including the replacement of the doorways in the outer bays with a new opening in the central bay, were introduced when the building was refurbished in 1988. Since then it has continued to be used for craft fairs and other community events.\n",
    "1538 novel by H\u00e9lisenne de Crenne\nThe Torments of Love is a French sentimental novel\u00a0by H\u00e9lisenne de Crenne, first published in 1538, that is considered the very first sentimental novel in French literature, and had the benefit of a great success at its first publication. The Torments of Love appears as an antinovel, but without being a parody.\nForm\nThe novel is divided into three main parts. The first part, which exposes a more feminine aspect, perspective, and point of view of this story, is taled by H\u00e9lisenne. The second part, written by H\u00e9lisenne, is, nonetheless, taled by Gu\u00e9n\u00e9lic, her lover. The third part is composed in the same way as the second one. A conclusion to the novel is written by Qu\u00e9zinstra, following the three main parts described above.\nPlot\nH\u00e9lisenne, who is actually the novel's narrator, is a young woman who has been married at age eleven. One day, she notices a young man named Gu\u00e9n\u00e9lic, who she immediately falls in love with. She firstly attempts to resist her attraction towards him, by recalling herself what terrible disgrace awaits the adulterous lovers. She recalls very well-known lovers in literature at her time, such as Helene, Medea, Euryalus or Lucretia in Ancient history, but also lovers such as Lancelot and Guinevere, or Tristan and Iseult, during the Middle Ages. Obsessed and tormented by the thought of Gu\u00e9n\u00e9lic, H\u00e9lisenne resolves herself into loving in secret, without telling him, so she can have the pleasure of a sight on him.\nSoon enough, H\u00e9lisenne's husband's animosity towards Gu\u00e9n\u00e9lic causes her a great anxiety, making her secret love the beginning of a torture. Despite the risk, H\u00e9lisenne starts staring voluptuously at Gu\u00e9n\u00e9lic. Her husband minds her loving gesture which leads him to become mad and jealous about it. The husband beats his wife, which causes H\u00e9lisenne to loose two of her teeth, she explains. Following this incident, the two lovers begin to write epistles to each other, but H\u00e9lisenne has been locked up by her husband, and attempts suicide.\nAn engraving from the novel.\nThe husband starts to take pity on H\u00e9lisenne, and sends her a priest so that she can confess and reason herself. She acknowledges her adulterous love to the priest, and claims she loves him to death. Later, H\u00e9lisenne and Gu\u00e9n\u00e9lic manage to meet again, and she demands Gu\u00e9n\u00e9lic to give her proofs of his true love. The husband threatens H\u00e9lisenne one more time, by beating her. Taking a flaming torch, he inflames multiple parts of her body. Following this violent scene, H\u00e9lisenne prays and requests God's mercy on Gu\u00e9n\u00e9lic so that her husband won't attempt murder on him.\nGu\u00e9n\u00e9lic now blames H\u00e9lisenne of expressing him empty words, which causes her new anxieties. The young man then starts rumors about his lover, claiming she would be his lascivious partner, which damages H\u00e9lisenne's reputation. She blames him for it, and he explains himself, but she later discovers that he continues to spoil her name by his false claims. H\u00e9lisenne is also betrayed by her household's servants, who report her activities to her husband. Deceived and isolated, the young woman's bedroom is now her only hideout, where she starts writing her mishaps, in the hope of diminishing the weight of her misadventures by writing them down on paper. Alas, her writing is quickly discovered by the husband. H\u00e9lisenne faints and her husband forces his wife to leave the city which they inhabited in, locking her up in the castle of Cabasus, a countryside residence. An old lady, her new servant, reassures her, since H\u00e9lisenne did only interact with Gu\u00e9n\u00e9lic by looking at, and talking to him. Therefore, she advises the young woman to grin and bear it, while hoping for a better condition.\u00a0\u00b7 \n",

    "A Japanese-Chinese conflict in 1916\nThe Dengjiatun Incident was a conflict that broke out between Chinese and Japanese forces in August 1916 during the Republican era of China in the eponymous town of Dengjiatun, Liaobei province (now part of Shuangliao, Jilin province). It lead to the deaths of 12 Japanese citizens and 4 Chinese citizens, and resulted in a Chinese apology to Japan.\nBackground\nIn 1905, the Japanese and Chinese Qing governments signed a treaty (Chinese name: \u4e2d\u65e5\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e1c\u4e09\u7701\u4e8b\u5b9c\u6761\u7ea6, Japanese name: \u6eff\u6d32\u5584\u5f8c\u6761\u7d04) conferring the right for military occupation of the South Manchuria Railway from the Russian Empire to the Japanese. In August 1904, Japanese troops entered the city of Dengjiatun under the pretense of having been accidentally attacked by Chinese policemen while the Japanese troops were undergoing military training nearby. Despite protests from the Chinese government, the Japanese military continued to occupy Dengjiatun.\nIn 1916, in the midst of the National Protection War, Mongol prince Babojab launched an attempt for Manchu and Mongol independence. Babojab entered Inner Mongolia with his troops but was defeated by Fengtian Army general Wu Junsheng. With more than 500 of his troops killed, Babojab retreated from the area, and Fengtian warlord Zhang Zuolin reinforced nearby Liaoyuan county, where Dengjiatun was located, with the 28th Division of the Fengtian Army.\nEvents\nAccording to some accounts, on August 13, 1916, a Chinese child was eating watermelon in Dengjiatun when he accidentally flicked some seeds onto the clothes of Japanese merchant Kishimoto Kiyokishi (Japanese: \u5409\u672c\u559c\u4ee3\u5409), who then beat the child in anger. Other accounts claim that a child was selling fish for 30 dollars, and Kishimoto insisted on buying the fish for 10 dollars, leading to him beating the child when the child refused. A Fengtian soldier in the 28th Division saw this and got into a scuffle with Kishimoto. The crowd that gathered around assisted the Chinese soldier, and Kishimoto went to the Japanese police to file a report after being badly beaten. A Japanese policeman Kawase, upon finding nobody at the local Chinese police station, went straight to the encampment of the 28th Division to settle the issue.:\u200a198\u200a However, the Chinese troops refused to talk, and beat Kawase instead. Kawase then requested assistance from the Japanese troops stationed in the area.\nJapanese lieutenant Matsuo Hikoji:\u200a187\u200a then lead around 20 troops into the Fengtian encampment demanding to meet the soldier that beat Kishimoto. During the dispute, a Japanese soldier cut off the right hand of a Fengtian soldier:\u200a195,198\u200a, resulting in the break-out of a gunfight. Troops from both sides were wounded and killed, including Kawase the policeman. As the Japanese troops were outnumbered by the 300 or so Chinese troops in the 28th Division, they retreated from the encampment.\nThree days later, Japanese reinforcements arrived at the break of dawn and set up 5 cannons outside Dengjiatun. Captain Iue sent a notice to county executive Jing Zhaofeng, demanding Chinese troops to withdraw from the area immediately. After discussion between Jing and the 28th Division, they decided to move the encampment outside the city limits. However, when Jing went to report the decision to the Japanese troops, Iue and the other commanders seized and Jing and did not let him leave. He was only released after trading for Jing's son to use as a hostage.\nOn August 24, the Japanese troops occupied the former Fengtian barracks, reinforcing their numbers to more than 1500 troops by the end of the month. The Japanese troops then established a consulate and police station.\nResolution\nThe Beijing government wished for the local Fengtian government to handle the affair, but the Japanese government demanded to negotiate with the Beijing government directly. Talks began with Japanese diplomat Hayashi Gonsuke on August 19, 1916. On September 2, Hayashi listed eight demands to minister Chen Jintao:\nTo severely reprimand 28th Division commander Feng Delin,\nTo severely reprimand the soldiers and officers involved in the incident and demote all officers of the 28th Division,\nTo issue a public apology and command all Northeastern army commanders order their troops to avoid conflict with Japanese troops,\nTo acknowledge Japan's right to station police and consultants in Southern Manchuria,\nTo hire Japanese military consultants in Chinese armies while in Southern Manchuria and Inner Mongolia,\nTo hire Japanese military instructors,\nTo compensate Japanese victims or the relatives of the dead,\nTo dispatch the military-governor of Fengtian to apologize in-person to Japanese colonial administrators.\nAfter the fifth and sixth demands were removed, the Beijing government accepted the demands in January 1917, demoting the division commander, punishing involved officers, compensating Kishimoto with 500 yuan, issuing a notice to treat Japanese citizens politely, and sending the Fengtian military-governor to ap",

    "\nFor a list of protests in the United States, see List of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in the United States in 2024.\nClockwise from top: \nUniversity of Amsterdam\nUniversity of Sydney\nMcGill University\nMonash University\nRadboud University Nijmegen\nThis is a list of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in 2024 since protests escalated on April 17, beginning with the Columbia University campus occupation. As of May 6, student protests have occurred in 45 out of 50 states in the United States, and the District of Columbia, with encampments, occupations, walkouts or sit-ins on almost 140 campuses.\nTwenty encampments have been established in the United Kingdom; across universities in Australia, beginning with the University of Sydney; and in Canada, including an encampment at McGill University. On May 7, protests spread further on European campuses after mass arrests at the University of Amsterdam campus occupation, including occupation of campus buildings at Leipzig University in Germany, Sciences Po in France, and Ghent University in Belgium. As of May 8, protests have taken place in more than 25 countries. On May 13, approximately 1,000 Dutch students and university staff took part in a national walk-out.\nBackground\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses.\nPro-Palestinian protests on university campuses escalated in April 2024, spreading in the United States and other countries, as part of wider Israel\u2013Hamas war protests. The escalation began after mass arrests at the Columbia University campus occupation, led by anti-Zionist groups, in which protesters demanded the university's disinvestment from Israel over its alleged genocide of Palestinians. On May 7, protests spread across Europe with mass arrests in the Netherlands. As of May 12, 20 encampments have also been established in the United Kingdom, and across universities in Australia and Canada. Some protesters have referred to the movement as the \"student intifada\".\nThe different protests' varying demands include severing financial ties with Israel, transparency over financial ties, an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions, and amnesty for protesters. Universities have suspended and expelled student protestors, in some cases evicting them from campus housing and restricting their access to campus resources. Some universities have relied on campus and local police to forcibly disband encampments and end occupations of university buildings. Police repression of student protests, particularly in the United States, has been characterized as unusually harsh. In the U.S. over 2,950 protesters have been arrested, including faculty members and professors, on over 60 campuses. Other universities made agreements with protesters in order for encampments to be dismantled. Some universities' graduation ceremonies were canceled, and further protests occurred at various graduation ceremonies in May 2024. The occupations have resulted in the closure of Columbia University, Cal Poly Humboldt, and the University of Amsterdam; Portland State University pausing financial ties with Boeing over its ties to Israel; and Trinity College Dublin agreeing to end certain investments in Israeli companies.\nOver 200 groups have expressed support for the protests, as well as Senator Bernie Sanders, members of Congress and several labor unions. The police response to the protests has also been criticized by various Democrats and human rights organizations. The protests have been compared to the 1960s anti-Vietnam protests and the 1968 protests. According to Axios, 8% of college students have participated in the protests.\nSupporters of Israel and some Jewish students have raised concerns about antisemitic incidents at or around the protests, prompting condemnations from leaders including President Joe Biden, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; as well as concern from Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Several students and faculty members who have participated in the protests, some of whom are Jewish, have insisted the protests are not antisemitic. Protesters and their allies have criticized the disposition of many university administrations as perpetuating a \"Palestine exception\" to academic freedom, and have raised concerns about anti-Palestinianism and islamophobia.\nList of countries\nArgentina\nOn April 25, around 20 students held a sit-in in the lobby of NYU Buenos Aires, aiming to show solidarity with NYU protesters in Manhattan and calling on the institution to cut ties with Israel.\nAustralia\nSee also: 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses \u00a7\u00a0Australia\nUniversity of Sydney\n\"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" at the University of Sydney, April 26, 2024\nOn April 23, an encampment was set up at the University of Sydney, in the main Quadrangle, underneath the historic clock tower.

    "Railway station in New Zealand\nSentry Hill railway station was a rural railway station on the modern day Waitara Branch railway. It also served as the junction between the New Plymouth - Waitara railway and the main line south until the junction was relocated to Lepperton in 1908. \nThe station is no longer open but the station site still sees trains from the Waitara Railway Preservation Society passing through.\nHistory\nThe original railway station was opened on 14 October 1875, approximately 12.47\u00a0km (7 miles 60 chains) east of New Plymouth station on the newly opened New Plymouth - Waitara railway. The station was located on Te Arei Road, close to the intersection with Mountain Road. Facilities included a Class 6 shelter shed and passenger platform, a loading bank, 40 x 30 foot shed for goods and several sidings.\nThe station officially became a junction station on 30 November 1877 when the line south to Inglewood opened. At this time Waitara was the main port for northern Taranaki, and the junction with the railway south was built facing Waitara. This meant that trains from Inglewood heading to New Plymouth (or vice versa) had to change direction at Sentry Hill.\nAs early as 1888 the design of the junction at Sentry Hill was causing complaints. A report from the time stated that \"the junction at present is very inconvenient\" and \"the annoyance and delay of shunting every train in and out of New Plymouth is great\". Consequently, a sharply-curved loop line was built forming a triangle. This allowed trains to head from New Plymouth south without the need to change direction - though at the cost of bypassing the Sentry Hill station yard. This meant trains stopping at Sentry Hill had to reverse back out of the station before taking the bypass loop to continue their journey.\nThis bypass loop was sharp (with a curve radius of only 6 chains) and was replaced with a new longer loop line on 2 April 1892. This new loop was cut under the existing road and a new overbridge was built to allow traffic to move freely. It was the first step in moving the junction station to a more suitable location.\nA Replacement Station\nThe next stage in upgrading the station occurred in 1894. On the 21st of November, a new station opened situated 768 metres (38 chains) from the old station, just south of the new loop line. This station (also called Sentry Hill) contained an accommodation shelter shed, passenger platform, water & coal services, fixed signals, urinals and a loop big enough to hold 32 wagons (plus back shunt). Good traffic continued to be worked at the old station grounds, with objections being received from J Little & Coy of Sentry Hill to the removal of the goods shed to the new site. The passenger shelter was removed from the old station. \nThe new station site was not completely satisfactory. The new station building did not have road access built at the time of the station opening, leading to complaints about poor access. By 1897 the junction station was still not completed, and at the request of residents, trains began stopping at the old station site again. It was noted that \"Waitara Branch train stops at the goods yard for goods traffic and also for coaling and watering the engine when required.\" In 1903 a new passenger shelter was constructed at the old Sentry Hill station site after petitions from the local community.\nThe other problem with the new station was that it was located on a grade, which caused issues with trains taking off from the new station site. By 1907, with the expense of interlocking the signalling looming, it was decided to move the entire new station roughly half a mile south to a more suitable location. The replacement station was named Lepperton Junction. At the same time, the Waitara Branch was extended to the new Lepperton Station, running parallel to the Marton - New Plymouth line.\nOn 25 May 1908, the new Lepperton Station was opened and the 'new' Sentry Hill station was closed. The 'old' Sentry Hill station was retained, served by branch line trains only. Finally, in 1914 the direct track between New Plymouth and old Sentry Hill station was finally removed.\nOther Facilities\nSentry Hill Workshops\nOn 30 September 1880 a new railway workshop was opened at Sentry Hill, responsible for all heavy maintenance on the isolated Taranaki Railways. The were located parallel to the main line on the northern side of Sentry Hill station. The workshops were employed 15 men and 4-5 boys by 1885. \nWith the opening of the railway through to Wanganui and Palmerston North on 23 March 1885, heavy maintenance work was soon relocated to East Town Workshops in Wanganui (despite local protests at the move).\nThe workshops were kept open in a reduced capacity as a car and wagon repair depot. However, by 1897 it was reported that the workshop was to close, with work being transferred to the railways new Morley Road facilities on the New Plymouth port line. \nSentry Hill Railway Station and Workshops circa 1880.\nSentry H",

    "African American civil rights activist\nJunius Griffin (January 13, 1929 \u2013 June 1, 2005) was an African American Civil Rights activist working as the President of the Beverly-Hills Hollywood chapter of the NAACP, who is best known for his work alongside Martin Luther King Jr. as well as for coining the term \u201cBlaxploitation\u201d in regard to the African American film industry of the 1970s.\nEarly life\nJunius Griffin was born in Stonega, Virginia, on January 13, 1929. Not much is known about Griffin's childhood, however by age 16 it is recorded that he decided to leave Stonega and go to Bluefield College in Virginia. After a short time there he found it not to be a good fit and decided to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. Though little is known of his social life during his 12 years in the Marines, there is later record of his parents being happily involved in his later life.\nCareer\nWhen Griffin enlisted in the United States Marines, he worked as a journalist and became well known for his writing, working as the Taiwan Bureau Chief for the Stars and Stripes. Griffin's writing quickly became in high demand as he was one of the first black reporters for not only the Stars and Stripes, but also The Associated Press and The New York Times. Griffin served in the military for a total of 12 years.\nDuring his time working for The New York Times, Griffin reported on the \"Blood Brothers\" gang as well as managed an interview with an unnamed member as many black journalists at the time were able to get closer to gang disputes than their white counterparts, however there is some dispute on the validity of these reports. Griffin alongside Caldwell and colleagues like Gerald Fraser, Austin Scott, Lester Carson, Ted Jones, Wallace Terry, Ted Poston, and Claude Lewis were all reporters who reported on situations from the front lines and often worked together comparing and sharing information to get the stories. Griffin worked as the Administrative Assistant Director of Public Relations, Minority Division of the Republican National Committee for 6 months when he was 38.\nIn 1966 Griffin, who had already been working closely with Martin Luther King Jr. as part of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, gained the attention of Motown. He was hired initially for Motown Records of Detroit as an administrative assistant to President Berry Gordy and Vice president Esther Edwards, before later becoming the Director of Publicity at International Talent Management Inc. for Motown's commitment of public services, which primarily focused on black causes.\nLater in 1970 Griffin assisted Coretta Scott King when establishing the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. He also assisted in Scott King's endorsement of George McGovern during the Democratic National Convention held in 1972 by providing a Rolls-Royce Limousine.\nGriffin was confirmed to have returned as President of the Beverly-Hills Hollywood Chapter of the NAACP in October 1972 after a brief hiatus in September.\nAfter his time working at Motown, Griffin, alongside Ewart Abner, and George Schiffer, created and became the heads of a new label, known as \u201cBlack Forum Records\u201d and shaped its political orientation, declaring it \u201cA Medium for the presentation of ideas and voices of the worldwide struggle of Black people to create a new era.\" Also stating that it was meant to document and provide historical materials of Black history for use in both academics and home study, Black Forum Records strived to record civil-right era on vinyl.\nOne of the most well known additions to Black Forum's catalogue was the recording of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s 1967 speech \u201cWhy I oppose the Vietnam War,\u201d recorded then released 1970 by Griffin. The label fell through in 1973 after its final album \"Elaine Brown\" as it was a spoken word catalogue and therefore did not move copies as fast as its music focused counterpart Motown. However the label was revived in 2021, being now headed by Jamila Thomas of Blackout Tuesday.\nControversy\nGriffin is most well known for his coinage of the term \u201cBlaxploitation,\u201d in his explanation of the distaste for the genre of movies prevailing from the 1965 through to the 1980s that Griffin believed \u2018ripped off\u2019 Blacks, and were \u201cgnawing away at the moral fiber of our  community.\u201d\nBlaxploitation films were a genre of film made by African Americans, for African Americans, about African Americans, focusing on urban life and struggles, with popular entries including \u2018Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,\u2019 (1971) \u2018SuperFly,\u2019(1972) \u2018Blacula,\u2019 (1972) \u2018Blackenstein,\u2019 (1973) and \u2018Detroit 9000\u2019 (1973) with which this movie specifically Griffin himself was the executive producer. The hypocrisy of this is noted by JET journalist William E. Berry, in Jet's September 20, 1973 issue.\nGriffin was a long-standing opposer for Blaxploitation as he believed it to be a sign of abandonment of hope. Griffin went on record to say that the popularity and approval of Blaxploitat",
    "Spanish soldier, sports leader, and politician\nAlfonso Ardura Altuna (1876 \u2013 5 April 1934) was a Spanish soldier, politician, and sports leader who served as the president of both RCD Espanyol in 1913 and 1914, and the Catalan Fencing Federation\u00a0 between 1929 and 1931.\nProfessional career\nHardoy was born in 1876 in Puerto Rico. He served as a soldier in Puerto Rico, but following the defeat in the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898, he was expatriated to the Iberian Peninsula, where he settled in Barcelona and married the daughter of Ramon Fern\u00e1ndez Vald\u00e9s, an entrepreneur in the electrical sector. In 1918 he was a member of the Consultative Board of the Circle of the Hispano-American Mercantile Union and of the Association of Neighbors of Carrer de Balmes for the promotion of the construction of the railway in 1924.\nIn the municipal elections of 1909, Ardura was elected municipal councilor of the City Council of Barcelona for District 8 in the ranks of the Radical Republican Party. Lawyer and judge by profession, he was a judge in the Courts of Barcelona, and in June 1931, he was the substitute judge of Josep Balaguer Ribas of the Sarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi district.\nSporting career\nPresidency of RCD Espanyol\nWhen RCD Espanyol was granted the title of Real (\"Royal\") by the King Alfonso XIII in 1912, the Ardura brothers, along with the likes of Juli\u00e0 Clapera and Emilio Sampere, and other radical figures left the club in reference to the Radical Republican Party founded in 1908 by Alejandro Lerroux, which was not on good terms with the attributes of royalty.\nOn 19 July 1913, Ardura was appointed as the seventh president of RCD Espanyol, replacing Santiago de la Riva, who had left the presidency. He was not a man who aspired to this position, but he was one of the few respected by the different antagonistic sectors of the club. Under his leadership, Ardura incorporated former prestigious members into the board of directors, such as the ex-president Juli\u00e0 Clapera and \ncaptain Emilio Sampere. He also trusted the experience of another ex-president: Evelio Donc\u00f3s, and his vice-president Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Hardoy to continue with the RCD Espanyol sports project.\nIn December 1913, when he was able to verify that the organizational chart was working well and that Hardoy was an intelligent man, well regarded by the members of the Board, and that he would agree to take over from him, Ardura decided to leave the presidency, being replaced by Hardoy.\nFencing\nFencing fight between Ardura and Manuel F. Creus in 1909.\nArdura was a renowned fencing master and an outstanding marksman who won several Spanish championships in Sabre, his best weapon. He used to train in the armory of Eduardo Alesson and excelled in sabre and sword modalities during his youth. In 1911, a group of shooters led by Ardura formed the El Foment de l\u2019Esgrima de Barcelona (the Promotion of Fencing in Barcelona Society), of which he was president and whose statutes were drawn by Mario Llorens on the proposals of master-at-arms F\u00e9lix Lyon d'Artiz. He was the 6th president of the Catalan Fencing Federation\u00a0 between 1929 and 1931.\nArdura was also a member of the Equestrian Circle\u00a0 and the Military Circle. In 1910 he was offered the honorary presidency of the Barcelona Hockey Club.\nDeath\nArdura died in Barcelona on 5 April 1934, at the age of 57 or 58 years old.\n",
    "Spanish pharmacist and footballer\nAvelino \u00c1lvarez Villanueva (4 November 1911 \u2013 16 August 1991) was a Spanish pharmacist and footballer who played as a midfielder for Madrid FC and Real Valladolid.\nEarly life and family\nAvelino \u00c1lvarez was born on 4 November 1911 in Mieres, Asturias, as the son of Florentina Villanueva Viejo \u00c1lvarez and teacher Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez Losa, who also owned a mine and other businesses in Tur\u00f3n, which allowed the couple to enjoy an economic position and give their seven children higher education in Madrid to keep them away from the world of the coal business.\nThree of his brothers (Ram\u00f3n, Carlos, and Luis) were doctors; another, Jos\u00e9, was an engineer, but Avelino became a pharmacist. As for the two sisters, Carmen, born in 1907, studied Educational Sciences, although she did not go on to practice, because her marriage in 1934 introduced her into Madrid's high society where it was frowned upon for women to work. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, she was caught in Republican Madrid with her newborn daughter, while her husband had stayed in Salamanca, and was then accused of collaborating with the fifth column and sentenced to death, a sentence that was commuted to 20 years of hard labor in the women's prison, where she remained until the entry of the national troops. Her other sister Mar\u00eda de la Luz, however, was not so lucky, as she was shot in one of the checas in Madrid.\nPlaying career\nUnlike his brothers, \u00c1lvarez was more drawn to sport and soon revealed himself to be a good football player, so he started playing for the San Pedro CF and soon moved to Imperio CF, which was a team made up of students and civil guards, but it also served as a subsidiary and youth team of Real Madrid. In his first season at the club, he stood out among his teammates as Imperio became champions of Spain in its category, so he was signed Real Madrid, where he had few chances. He appears as a reserve for the squad between 1932 and 1934, and only played 7 league games in the first team as a midfielder, featuring alongside the likes of Ricardo Zamora, F\u00e9lix Quesada, Josep Samitier, and Luis Regueiro. In an interview published in Ecos del Valle in November 1984, \u00c1lvarez confessed to journalist Amadeo Gancedo that at that time, with Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez Coronado as manager, he earned 650 pesetas a month, while the main starters earned a thousand, a salary that in those days times was extraordinary.\n\u00c1lvarez then continued his career at Valladolid in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936 put a sudden end to his footballing career since El Caracolillo, as the fans knew him because of his messy hair, no longer returned to professional football. Under pressure from his family, he returned to his hometown to dedicate himself to pharmacy and develop his life by participating in the social life of Tur\u00f3n.\nLater life and death\nOn 1 January 1983, after spending 43 years attending to the medical needs of his neighbors, \u00c1lvarez retired, becoming a popular and beloved figure who continued to combine his love of mountains and hunting with playing Julepe daily and an outstanding activity linked to social, cultural, and sports movements, even as a municipal mayor, which led to a well-deserved tribute paid to him by the Turonese group on 21 March 1986, in which more than 300 people representing everything that Tur\u00f3n counted as associations or clubs of all kinds, celebrated not only his retirement, but a good and fruitful life. The people of Tur\u00f3n considered him \"a silent humanist\", always committed to his craft and hometown.\n\u00c1lvarez died in a Madrid residence in the second fortnight of August 1991, at the age of 79.\nHonours\nReal Madrid\nCopa del Rey:\nChampions (1): 1934\nSee also\nList of Real Madrid CF players\n",

    "1994 Spanish novel by Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ma\u00f1as\nHistorias del Kronen is the first novel by Madrid-born Spanish author Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ma\u00f1as, with which he was a finalist for the Premio Nadal in January 1994. Published by Spanish publishing house Ediciones Destino in 1994\u2014when the author was only 23 years old, and which he claims he wrote in only 15 days\u2014it is the first book by the author in the so-called \"Kronen Tetralogy,\" along with Mensaka, Ciudad rayada, and Sonko95\u00a0. It was adapted to the screen by director Montxo Armend\u00e1riz in 1995 and translated both into German\u2014Die Kronen-Bar\u2014and into Dutch. The novel has been considered a success and a best seller. Literarily speaking, it belongs to Generation X.\nDetailed description of the plot\nNighttime view of the Gran V\u00eda, a well-known street in Madrid.\nThe novel takes place during the month of July 1992 in the city of Madrid. Carlos is the main protagonist. He's a young university student, barely 21 years old, who is described as a \"spoiled brat,\" self-centered, and lacking empathy, whose life revolves only around alcohol, drugs, and sex. He often meets his friends at the Kronen, his favorite (fictitious) bar, located in the novel in the vicinity of Francisco Silvela Street in Madrid. In the book, he is described as a sociopath. Carlos experiences a progressive process of isolation, alienation, and \"solipsistic introversion\" that eventually leads to the novel's climax, in which the death of one of his friends\u2014Fierro, a diabetic who has a weak personality and whom the gang believes is a homosexual, apart from a masochist\u2014takes place at his own birthday party, resulting from being forced to drink a bottle of whisky through a funnel and putting cocaine on his penis, which leads to a fatal overdose.\nStructure and style\nLas Ventas bullfighting ring, where Carlos goes to an Elton John concert with Amalia. There was actually a concert by the English singer at this venue on 14 July 1992.\nThe book's original cover included a silk-screen printing of Andy Warhol's 5 Deaths on Orange (Orange Disaster)\u2014a crashed car with the dead body of a woman underneath it. The novel opens and ends with the lyrics from Giant, a song by British band The The. Narrated in the first person\u2014through Carlos's point of view\u2014 it stresses the dizzying, very fluid rhythm, thanks to the dynamic dialogue that makes up most of the novel, alternated with narrated fragments. The visual component of the novel has also been praised.\nIn order to emphasize the fleeting and frivolous nature of the novel's narrative, the author makes use of the resource of inserting strings of location names, in which he omits verbs or articles, or even pronouns. Historias del Kronen is also characterized by the precise description of the place where the action unfolds, mentioning real places around Madrid, such as the Plaza del Dos de Mayo square, the Parque de las Avenidas park, the Las Ventas bullfighting ring, or the Gran V\u00eda street, among others. The style used by Ma\u00f1as in the book has been referred to as slightly monotonous. Despite this, he manages to reach a point of narrative tension by the end of the novel. This ending, which culminates in Fierro's death\u2014one of Carlos's friends\u2014has been praised by its original style in the form of a monologue. One hallmark of the narrative is also the constant recurrence to slang expressions used by young people, by putting them in the mouths of the protagonists. In this sense, some of the terms that stand out include the constant use by Carlos of the offensive term cerdas to refer to women; neologisms; or the appearance of colloquialisms that refer to the world of drugs, such as: costo, chocolate, tripi,, farlopa, or nevadito. The use of offensive or dysphemistic expressions is common in the slang used by the young people in the novel. Ma\u00f1as also resorts to the insertion of numerous musical references in the book, even including song lyrics by bands such as The The, Nirvana (Come as You Are and Drain You), Siniestro Total (Bailar\u00e9 sobre tu tumba), or Los Ronaldos (S\u00ed, s\u00ed).\nContext and influences\nJos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ma\u00f1as, the novel's author, in 2006.\nHistorias del Kronen represents the conversion of the U.S. cultural concept of Generation X to the Spanish society. In fact, it has been considered one of the definitive novels of this generational movement in Spain, which has been called, precisely, \"Generation Kronen.\" The novel is considered to be neo-realist in style.\nIt has been compared to Douglas Coupland's Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture\u2014the novel that popularized the term Generation X\u2014and it has even been mentioned that it could be its \"Spanish version.\" On the other hand, it has been said that Historias del Kronen contains parallelisms with Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises (1926), Carmen Laforet's Nada (1945), or Juan Mars\u00e9's \u00daltimas tardes con Teresa\u00a0 (1966), as well as Rafael S\u00e1nchez Ferlosio's El Jarama\u00a0 (1955), due to the realism of these novels. Ma\u00f1as even agreed with this",

    "The Afghan Commando Forces were the former combined commando, paratrooper and special formations of the Afghan Armed Forces, composed of numerous brigades, regiments and battalions established by King Mohammad Zahir Shah in 1964 and disbanded in 1992, following the collapse of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the events of the Afghan Civil War.\nMilitary unit\nCommandos under the Kingdom of Afghanistan\nThe history of special units within the Afghan Armed Forces dates back to early 1964 when the 242nd Parachute Battalion was established, the Royal Afghan Army\u2019s first elite formation which was an independent battalion, subordinate to the General Staff. Sardar Abdul Wali, Commander-in-Chief of the 1st Central Army Corps, established the battalion in order to suppress demonstrations, riots in the capital Kabul, and to prevent potential coup attempts. Command of the battalion was passed down to Capt. Habibullah, who recently completed the Infantry Officers\u2019 Advanced Course and airborne training in Fort Benning, United States. The 242nd Parachute Battalion was stationed in Sherpur Fort, northwest Kabul where they conducted airborne training in Bagram and Jalalabad.\nDuring the summer of 1967, the 444th Commando Battalion was formed by Sardar Abdul Wali, becoming the Royal Afghan Army\u2019s second elite formation and the most important commando unit in Afghanistan's military history. The 444th Commando Battalion was commanded by Lt. Col. Aqel Shah, who later passed it to Maj. Rahmatullah Safi, who received in the British Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and the Soviet Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School. The battalion was stationed in Bala Hissar fortress in the southern outskirts of Kabul, being airborne-qualified and under the control of the 1st Central Army Corps. To properly accommodate the new commando formations, they were given access to BTR-40 personnel carriers, tanks and other military equipment. Gen. Khushal Peroz, of 444th Commando, also stated they were the first unit in the Royal Afghan Army to use the AK-47 rifle. The early commando and parachute battalion's officer base was primarily made up of the Afghan aristocracy and those close to Sardar Abdul Wali, fearing a potential coup attempt from Mohammad Daoud Khan.\nUniform specifications\nUnder the reign of Mohammed Zahir Shah, more specifically in 1964, the 242nd Parachute Battalion wore locally produced one-piece olive drab overalls, inspired by those worn by the Soviet Airborne Forces, as well as metal airborne wings with a black cloth backing. They additionally wore a black sleeve badge depicting a silver bullion airborne cap with wheat and red thunderbolts on each side. In 1967, the 444th Commando Battalion wore the standard khaki Afghan Army uniform, as well as a distinct blue patch with a singular red lightning flash and jump wings with a light blue cloth backing. The Afghan commandos wore Soviet-style pilotkas, adorned with a small metal pin of the Royal Afghan Army\u2019s insignia or a military variant of Afghanistan\u2019s national emblem. The commandos became the first unit in the Afghan Army to use Frog Skin camouflage two-piece uniforms in 1969, initially imported from the Soviet Union. In 1970, paratroopers also resorted to using Frog Skin camouflage. Maroon berets additionally become part of the commando headdress, pulled down to the right.\nOperations under the Kingdom of Afghanistan\nOn 24 May 1970, the first documented commando operation took place, involving the suppression of anti-government protests by the Islamic clergy. Up to 1500\u20133000 mullahs from the eastern and southern regions of Afghanistan travelled to Kabul\u2019s Pul-e Khishti Mosque and protested against:\nThe activities of the PDPA and a publication of newspaper \u201cParcham\u201d which celebrated the centenary for Vladimir Lenin\u2019s birth\n\u201cAnti-religious\u201d films being shown on television about Prophet Yusuf\nDisplays of caricatures of Prophet Mohammed and his number of marriages being quoted by foreign press outlets and the leftist \u201cEsalat\u201d newspaper (which is still in existence)\nSardar Abdul Wali ordered units of the Royal Afghan Army, such as the 717th Civil Disciplinary Regiment, to remove the protestors by force and use buses to deport them out of Kabul, back to their homes. The 717th arrived at Pul-e Khishti Mosque at 2:00am, with the 444th Commando Battalion arriving with tanks and armoured vehicles, led by Col. Rahmatullah Safi. The protestors performed a sleep-in outside of the mosque and inside its courtyard as a form of peaceful protest, as soldiers attempted to wake them up and make them leave the area. As a result of the protestors not leaving the mosque, the soldiers used their gunstocks to disperse the crowd, as they reluctantly moved towards Maiwand Road where the supplementary buses were parked to deport the protestors from the capital. The protestors reluctantly went inside the buses, shouting \u201cDeath to Abdul Wali\u201d and \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d.\nCommandos under the Republic of Afghanistan",
    "Small nature preserve\nA plant micro-reserve (abbr. PMR) is a type of small nature preserve that targets rare or threatened plant species, protecting the species' main populations from further decline. They also serve as hotspots for biodiversity monitoring, seed collection, and plant management. A micro-reserve centers around a single habitat or plant habitat, and is usually smaller than 20 hectares. A PMR may be located on public or private land, and is obtained by a governmental agency by a voluntary turnover of the area. They are managed by national, regional, or local governments, or by individuals, families, or non-governmental organizations. First piloted in the Spanish province of Valencia in 1990, the concept was subsequently funded by the European LIFE programme. It has since spread across Europe, including large networks in Bulgaria, Latvia, Cyprus, and Greece.\nCharacteristics\nWhile the precise definition of a plant micro-reserve may vary based on which country it has been established in, a 2014 planning document described them as \"protected natural plots to ensure the biological monitoring and conservation management\". PMRs can be centered on many different kinds of locations and habitats. Each of these habitats can be considered as a \"biogeographic island\", with unique evolutionary pressures that force adaptations and lead to increased biodiversity. Smaller sites may be characterized by a spring, small islet, or coastal cliffside. Larger sites might have such pressures as skeletal or saline soil, or rocky scree.\nInformational sign at the Els Miradors PMR in Pinet, Valencia\nThere is also no exact requirement for the size of a plant micro-reserve. In Crete and Spain, they are considered to be reserves with an area of less than 20 hectares, while elsewhere in the Mediterranean the upper limit is 100 hectares. However, they have the shared characteristic of intensively protecting one or several highly threatened plant species, usually endemics. PMRs are organized based on \"singularity\", or the individual site, and \"complementarity\", or their ability to contribute to a larger patchwork of conservational areas. In an ideal scenario, a plant micro-reserve should consist of the core protection area, where the defining habitat feature is located, and be surrounded by a buffer area to reduce the impact of external threats. However, some PMRs that are surrounded by a large amount of human developments, buffer zones may be impossible to establish. In either place, boundaries should be clearly defined by landmarking and signposts. These may consist of informational signs directed at visitors or tourists, indicative signals to warn against unintentional damage to the protected area, or perimetric signals to demarcate the exact border of the reserve.\nIn some cases, governments may have the authority to seize and conserve land; however, the area of a plant micro-reserve must be obtained voluntarily. Private or public entities can turn over land to be managed as a PMR, but this agreement is permanent and not revokable. Boundaries are sometimes defined geographically, and other times by the plant population of the PMR. As such, the area of some PMRs could shift based on the protected population. The private PMRs are run by either individual families or landowners, or by conservation non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Public reserves are owned by either city councils, provincial governments, or national governments.\nInside a micro-reserve, certain actions that would damage the protected plants are forbidden. In all PMRs, no human action can be taken that would impact the protected plants themselves or the soil substrate they live on. The exception to this rule is that livestock ranching may be allowed for plants that rely on grazing to reproduce. Each micro-reserve may also have additional prohibitions on a case-to-case basis, such as restrictions on hiking or climbing. Certain activity is allowed in PMRs that might be forbidden in other types of nature preserves, such as hunting animals and gathering invertebrates. These human activities are sometimes even encouraged, especially when they contribute to the maintenance of the current state of the PMR. Additionally, PMRs are rarely fenced or otherwise cut off from surrounding areas by physical barriers.\nPurpose\nSilene hifacensis was reintroduced to its previous habitats following seed collection from a plant micro-reserve.\nThe general purpose of a plant micro reserve is to provide a protected area for the conservation of rare plants that can only thrive in a very limited niche or habitat. PMRs must be actively managed; conservation areas that only have \"passive or preventative protection\" should not be considered PMRs. They help preserve the type localities of plant species, and protect against uncontrolled urban sprawl by restricting changes to land use. Seeds collected from PMRs can be used to reintroduce plants to localities where they were previously extinc",
    "13th century inquisition\nThe German Inquisition was established by Pope Gregory IX in 1231, and the first inquisitor was appointed in the territory of Germany. In the second half of the 14th century, permanent structures of the Inquisition were organized in Germany, which, with the exception of one tribunal, survived only until the time of the Reformation in the first half of the 16th century. In combating heretics in Germany, the Inquisition always played a secondary role compared to the ecclesiastical courts.\nGeographically, the jurisdictional area of the German Inquisition from 14th to 16th century encompassed the ecclesiastical metropolitan provinces: Mainz, Cologne, Salzburg, Bremen, and Magdeburg, as well as the Archdiocese of Trier (without suffragans), the Diocese of Basel (belonging to the province of Besan\u00e7on), exempted dioceses of Bamberg, Meissen, and Pomerania, as well as the Livonian territories belonging to the Teutonic Order. Burgundy and Lorraine, and until 1515 also southern Netherlands, although part of the Holy Roman Empire, were subject to French inquisitors appointed by the provincial of the Dominicans in Paris.\nHeretics in Germany from 11th to 13th century\nThe first mention of heretics in late medieval Germany dates back to 1051 when Emperor Henry III, against the protests of Catholic clergy, ordered the hanging of several individuals in Goslar who were deemed Manicheans due to their refusal to kill animals and consume meat. However, little is known about this group. Around 1114/1115, Tanchelm of Utrecht operated in the diocese of Utrecht, who was also accused of heresy. However, it is more likely that he was merely a radical and tactless religious reformer who antagonized the corrupt clergy of Utrecht too much. In any case, after his murder in 1115, his movement collapsed. From 1143 onwards, the presence of the dualistic Cathar sect was recorded in the Rhineland, which from the beginning met with hostile reception. In 1143, Count Otto von Rheineck burned three Cathars in Bonn, and in the same and following years, there were extrajudicial punishments of Cathars captured in Cologne and Li\u00e8ge. At that time, too, the Catholic clergy was opposed to the persecution of heretics. In 1163, there were again extrajudicial punishments of Cathars in Cologne, and shortly thereafter, they were expelled from Mainz. However, it seems that this sect did not establish lasting roots in Germany. Evidence of its presence in Germany in the first half of the 13th century is ambiguous, and later it is absent altogether.\nA much greater role in the history of German heterodoxy before the Reformation was played by the Waldensian movement, which from the end of the 12th century gained an increasingly wide following, particularly in the Rhineland, Austria, and Bavaria, and later also in Brandenburg and Pomerania. It was against the Waldensians that one of the first organized large-scale repressive actions was directed. In 1212, Bishop Heinrich Veringen of Strasbourg discovered Waldensians in his diocese and, as a result of the investigation conducted, identified as many as 500 suspects, 80 of whom were burned at the stake.\nIn March 1232, Emperor Frederick II officially ordered that all people guilty of heresy in Germany should be punished by death by burning at the stake unless they submitted to the Church.\nKonrad von Marburg\nKonrad von Marburg \u2013 the first papal inquisitor\nFrom 1227 onwards, sermons against heretics in Germany were preached by Konrad von Marburg, the confessor of Elisabeth of Thuringia. In October 1231, Pope Gregory IX expanded his mandate, appointing him as a delegate judge to combat heretics. In this way, Konrad became the first papal inquisitor in history, although formally both before and after this date he was only titled as Praedicator Verbi Dei (Preacher of the Word of God), not as Inquisitor haereticae pravitatis (Inquisitor of Heretical Perversity), as was the official title of papal inquisitors after 1233.\nKonrad chose several fanatical collaborators to assist him, including Conrad Dorso and John the One-Eyed. Their activities quickly aroused fear. According to contemporary accounts, they gave the accused no opportunity for defense. Those who confessed to heresy received absolution, and as a penance, their heads were shaved as a mark of shame. Those who maintained their innocence were sentenced to the stake without proper verification of the charges. Konrad himself and his assistants were aware of the arbitrariness of their methods and the risk of error, but they reportedly claimed that they would burn a hundred innocents if there was even one guilty among them. In these conditions, inquisitorial activity also elicited protests from Catholics, including clergy. Archbishop Siegfried III von Eppstein of Mainz finally admonished Konrad, urging moderation. However, Konrad ignored these appeals. He was confident in the support of Pope Gregory IX, to whom he reported on the existence of a sec",
    "Single-species lichen genus\nCrutarndina is a monotypic fungal genus in the family Graphidaceae. It contains the single species Crutarndina petractoides, a corticolous (bark-dwelling), crustose lichen.\nTaxonomy\nThe sole species of Crutarndina was first formally described in 1995 by Per Magnus J\u00f8rgensen and Irwin Brodo, who originally classified it in the genus Thelotrema. Sittiporn Parnmen, Robert L\u00fccking, and H. Thorsten Lumbsch circumscribed the genus Crutarndina in 2012 to contain the species after molecular phylogenetics analysis showed that it represented a unique lineage.\nThe genus name Crutarndina honours the eminent British lichenologist Peter Crittenden from Nottingham, who assisted in collecting the type material during a field excursion organized by the British Lichen Society. The surname Crittenden originates from Old British and Welsh, translating to \"the cot on the lower hill,\" combining \"cru\" (cot), \"tarn\" (lower), and \"dun\" or \"din\" (hill).\nDescription\nCrutarndina is distinguished from the closely related genus Thelotrema primarily by its unique apothecial structure. In Crutarndina, the fruiting bodies (apothecia) have star-like, multi-layered margins, which differ significantly from those observed in Thelotrema. The thallus, or body, of Crutarndina lichens lacks a cortex, meaning it does not have a protective outer layer. The apothecia are erumpent, meaning they break through the thallus surface as they develop, and they are generally rounded in shape. The central disc of the apothecia is largely hidden by the surrounding exciple. This exciple is strikingly star-like and has multiple layers, adding to the distinct appearance of the lichen.\nThe exciple varies in composition, being hyaline (transparent) at the base but becoming carbonised (turning to a black, carbon-rich compound) towards the top. The ascospores, which are the reproductive spores formed in the asci (spore-producing cells), are fusiform (spindle-shaped) and transversely septate, meaning they have multiple cross walls (septa). These walls are thickened, and the spaces between them are lens-shaped to rounded, a feature described as distoseptate. The spores are colourless and react positively to iodine staining (I+). Crutarndina does not produce secondary metabolites (lichen products).\nHabitat and distribution\nCrutarndina petractoides is predominantly found in oceanic regions, growing on the somewhat shaded, smooth bark of trees, especially Corylus (hazel) and Sorbus (rowan). While it may occasionally colonise other broadleaved trees, it primarily grows in the sheltered woodlands and boggy areas of temperate rainforests. The species is locally abundant in Western Scotland and Western and Southwestern Ireland. It is, however, very rare in North Wales and Cumbria.\n",

The teams who finished in 3rd to 6th place in the Championship and League One and the 4th to 7th-placed teams in League Two compete. The winners of the semi-finals advance to the finals, with the winners gaining promotion for the following season.\nBackground\nThe English Football League play-offs have been held every year since 1987. They take place for each division following the conclusion of the regular season and are contested by the four clubs finishing below the automatic promotion places.

Leeds United could only secure automatic promotion if they beat Southampton and Ipswich Town lost to Huddersfield Town. In the end, Leeds United missed out on automatic promotion after losing to Southampton, confirming they would finish 3rd. Ipswich Town won their match against Huddersfield. Norwich City, West Bromwich Albion, and Hull City were all in the hunt for the last two spots. West Bromwich Albion leapfrogged Norwich City to 5th after beating Preston North End. Despite their loss to relegation-threatened Birmingham City, Norwich City managed to finish 6th after Hull City also lost against Birmingham City's relegation rivals Plymouth Argyle.\nFirst leg\n12 May 202412:00 BSTCarrow Road, NorwichAttendance: 26,982Referee: Josh Smith\n12 May 202414:15 BSTThe Hawthorns, West BromwichAttendance: 25,367Referee: Samuel Barrott\nSecond leg\n16 May 202420:00 BSTElland Road, LeedsAttendance: 36,384Referee: Jarred Gillett\nLeeds United won 4\u20130 on aggregate.\n17 May 202420:00 BSTSt Mary's Stadium, SouthamptonAttendance: 30,712Referee: Tim Robinson\nSouthampton won 3\u20131 on aggregate.\nChampionship final\nMain article: 2024 EFL Championship play-off final\n26 May 202415:00 BSTWembley Stadium, London\nLeague One\nMain article: 2023\u201324 EFL League One\nLeague One semi-finals\nThe final table was confirmed after the final matchday on 27 April 2024.

In the end, they drew with Peterborough United, who had also already guaranteed their place in the play-offs  to finish 3rd and 4th respectively. The final day also saw a four-way battle between Barnsley, Oxford United, Lincoln City and Blackpool for the final two spots.

Thanks to Doncaster Rovers' spectacular run from February onwards, where they only lost once coupled with a 10-match win streak, a draw against Gillingham was enough to see them finish 5th. A draw against Colchester United was also enough for Crewe Alexandra to secure 6th. Crawley Town's win over Grimsby Town saw them take 7th as Barrow's draw against Mansfield Town meant they would drop out off the play-offs.

    "2024 video game\n2024 video game\nLife Eater is a 2024 video game developed by Strange Scaffold and published by Strange Scaffold and Frosty Pop for Windows. The game is a narrative horror puzzle game in which players are a murderer that use an interactive timeline to learn the routines and vulnerabilities of their victims. The game was concepted by independent developer Xalavier Nelson Jr, who aimed to create a \"horror fantasy kidnapping simulator\" that explored themes of surveillance in a fantasy horror context. Upon release, Life Eater received mixed to average reviews from critics, with reviewers noting the impact and ambition of its premise, but expressing mixed views on the effect of its gameplay and narrative to execute its concept.\nGameplay\nPuzzle gameplay in Life Eater requires players to fill in a timeline to identify the characteristics and routines of the correct target.\nLife Eater is a puzzle game in which the player is a murderer that uses an interactive timeline similar to video editing software to plan an opportunity to abduct a specific victim nominated at the start of every stage. Each round of the game takes place over two phases. The first phase, set out on a timeline representing the routines of one or more victims. The timeline of each victim is segmented by empty slots representing their various activities throughout the days of the week. To uncover these activities and locate the appropriate opportunity to kidnap them, players select a series of actions that represent methods of stalking them. These actions are constrained by a time limit and suspicion meter, requiring the player to manage their time and not raise the meter. Once the suspicion meter passes a threshold three times, or the time limit runs out, the game is over. Some activities on the timeline can only be revealed by taking more intrusive actions as greater cost to time and suspicion. Players can reduce the level of suspicion by undertaking activities at cost to their available time. Once the player identifies a sufficient percentage of the victim's activities in that week, they are able to select a victim to abduct.\nThe second phase of the game presents the player with statements about the correct victim, requiring them to demonstrate knowledge from the evidence they collected in the first phase of the game. Players answer these questions using an interface representing the sacrifice of the victim, removing certain bodily organs based on whether or not the victim met certain conditions such as their habits, living status and appearance. If the player removes the organs correctly based on these conditions, the player is successful, otherwise they must restart the stage. Certain conditions, such as whether the victim lived alone, requires the player to infer the nature of the victim based upon the evidence they have collected, occasionally from the habits of other characters that have been surveilled. As the game progresses, multiple characters are able to be monitored or abducted in the first phase of the game. The instructions on which targets are to be abducted also can be abstract, such as to \"find a monster\", requiring deeper investigation to abduct the correct victim.\nPlot\nThe player character, Ralph, is a \"modern-day Druid\" in servitude to Zimforth, a god that threatens to bring about the end of the world unless the player provides them with annual sacrifices. To meet these ends, Ralph abducts and murders specific targets identified by Zimforth by monitoring their personal lives and routines. He also abducts and imprisons a victim, Johnny, placing him in a cage. Over the years in service to Zimforth, Ralph develops increasing paranoia and guilt about their involvement in procuring sacrifices as they develop a one-sided friendship with Johnny. Throughout the game, it is left ambiguous as to whether Ralph is sane or truly  tormented by the demands of Zimforth.\nDevelopment and release\nLife Eater was developed by Strange Scaffold, the studio of independent developer Xalavier Nelson Jr. Life Eater was developed following the developer securing a five-game publishing contract with independent publisher Frosty Pop. Nelson Jr. stated that the concept arose from the desire to create a \"kidnapping sim\" with a horror-fantasy theme using timeline-based games like those used in John Wick Hex. The game intended to explore the \"dark and interesting design questions\" arising from the exploitation of \"information culture\" and surveillance, such as geotagging, to use for harm. The Saw film series and 10 Cloverfield Lane were also cited as inspiration for the concept of the game. Life Eater was announced with the release of a trailer on 6 March 2024, and released on 16 April.\nReception\nReception\nAccording to review aggregator Metacritic, Life Eater received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics. Whilst all critics acknowledged the ambition and uniqueness of the game's concept,  they expressed mixed views on the execution on its game",
    "2024 diss track by Kendrick Lamar\n\"Meet the Grahams\" is a diss track by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was released on May 3, 2024, during his ongoing feud with Canadian rapper Drake. It is Lamar's response to and premiered less than an hour after the release of Drake's \"Family Matters\", a diss track mainly aimed at Lamar.\nBackground\nMain article: Drake\u2013Kendrick Lamar feud\nDrake, born Aubrey Drake Graham, has an immediate family including his parents, Sandra and Dennis Graham, and Adonis, Drake's son with Sophie Brussaux. Adonis was initially kept from the public eye but was confirmed by Drake after rapper Pusha T alleged his existence on the diss track \"The Story of Adidon\". The feud between Drake and Lamar, although long ongoing since the 2010s, rose to new heights in March 2024, with Lamar attacking Drake's persona and skill with his verse on the song \"Like That\". Drake followed up to Lamar's verse and other diss tracks by other artists such as Rick Ross, Future, and The Weeknd with his own diss track, \"Push Ups\". In response, Lamar released \"Euphoria\", calling Drake's heritage as a mixed-black man into question. The same week, he released another diss track, \"6:16 in LA\", claiming to have moles in Drake's label OVO Sound. Drake responded the same day with the track \"Family Matters\" in which he accused Lamar of domestic violence against longtime partner Whitney Alford. Less than an hour later, Lamar released \"Meet the Grahams\".\nComposition\nProduced by the Alchemist, \"Meet the Grahams\", unlike Lamar's previous responses, takes on an unsettling, haunting atmosphere, with an eerie piano-driven beat accompanying critical lyrics accusing Drake of a number of wrongdoings including parental negligence, sexual exploitation, sexual grooming, sex trafficking, and another incident of child abandonment.\nThe track's lyrics take the form of a letter with multiple verses addressed at members of Drake's family. The first verse is addressed to Drake's son Adonis, the second is addressed to Dennis and Sandra \"Sandi\" Graham, both of Drake's parents, the third is addressed to Drake's alleged daughter, and the last verse is addressed to Drake himself. In the song, Lamar alleges that Drake has a secret child, a daughter, accuses Drake of fathering further children aside from his alleged daughter, states that Drake has sex offenders on his record label OVO Sound, and calls him a sexual predator. Lamar also mentions that Drake is allegedly running a sex trafficking ring out of his Toronto mansion and states that his mansion known as \"The Embassy\" will be raided by law enforcement because of this. Lamar also compares Drake's actions to those of former film producer and convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein. Lamar, in the final section of the track addressing Drake, addresses the confusion that came out of the track releasing within an hour of Drake's \"Family Matters\" with the lines \"Dear Aubrey / I know you're probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party / But truthfully, I don't have a hatin' bone in my body / There's supposed to be a good exhibition within the game / But you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name\".\nCover art\nThe cover art used in the original YouTube release shows an uncropped version of the photo that accompanied Lamar's previous song, \"6:16 in LA\". In addition to the glove, it shows a shirt, jewelry receipts, a visit card and three prescription medicines with the name \"Aubrey Graham\" (Drake's real name) on them, later revealed to be one for Ozempic, one for Adderall, and one for Zolpidem. According to DJ Akademiks, these items were stolen from a suitcase belonging to Drake's father, Dennis Graham. A week later, an unknown X (formerly Twitter) user posted a video playing the song on a Panasonic Toughbook and showing the original photo items hanging at a balcony, requiring Drake and Akademiks to retract their theft accusation.\nThe song was released to streaming platforms the next day with the artwork being replaced with a black square, possibly due to Apple Music and Spotify guidelines prohibiting the sharing of personal information with the inclusion of the pill bottles.\nCredits and personnel\nKendrick Lamar \u2013 vocals, songwriting\nThe Alchemist \u2013 production\nNicolas De Porcel \u2013 mastering\nJohnathan Turner \u2013 mixing\nRay Charles Brown Jr. \u2013 engineering\nCharts\nSee also\nList of notable diss tracks\n",
    "1996 biography of Jerzy Kosinski by James Park Sloan\nJerzy Kosinski: A Biography is a 1996 biography of the Polish-American and Jewish writer Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski by American scholar James Park Sloan, published by Dutton.\nBackground\nSloan and Kosinski were professional acquaintances for about 20 years.\nContent\nAs the title implies, the book is a biography of the Polish-American and Jewish writer Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski.\nReception\nThe book received several reviews in press. It was reviewed twice for The New York Times, first by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt and later, by Louis Begley. Lehmann-Haupt called the biography \"fascinating\" and \"extremely worthwhile\", stressing that it shows how life, from his very childhood, taught Kosinski the value of \"inauthenticity\" which later became a guiding philosophy of his life; he did however criticized Sloan for being\" left-handed in his defense\" of some of Kosinski's weaker works. Begley was less fond of the book, calling it \"chaotic\", perhaps \"written in unusual haste\" (Kosinski died in 1991). He wrote that Sloan carries out only a \"perfunctory\" review of Kosinski literary works, and instead \"revels in unappetizing disclosures about Kosinski's life... and, ultimately, he doesn't make much sense of his subject\".\nJulia Bloch Frey reviewed it for the Los Angeles Times. She notes that Sloan convincingly shows how Holocaust experiences damaged Kosinski's psyche, turning  him into a \"pathological liar\", and that Sloan compares Kosinski to Balzac, whom he calls another \u201ccongenial, incorrigible liar.\u201d She praises the author for \"meticulous research\" and notes that the book is relatively balanced and neutral, not an easy task considering its controversial subject. Nonetheless she also concludes that given that Sloan and Kosinski were acquaintances, \"Sloan\u2019s studiously neutral position ends up sounding like an apologia for Kosinski\" and at times reads \"like a justification of the misdeeds of a brilliantly flawed friend\".\nThe book was also reviewed by an anonymous reviewer for the Chicago Tribune. The reviewer observed that \"Sloan seems to see Kosinski with greater clarity than many of his rabid detractors or passionate defenders\".\nD. G. Myers reviewed the book for First Things. The reviewer stresses how Kosinski disliked conformity and therefore, communism that his father swore an allegiance to, developing anti-commumist views. Myers argues that Sloan underestimates Kosinski's anti-communist views, arguing that Sloan is a left-leaning liberal and thus unable to understand much of Kosinski who was more of a right-leaning one; therefore Myers criticizes Sloan for being \"helpless in dealing with  ideas\" and unable to properly understand Kosinski's ideology. He also criticizes the book for \"troubling features\" such as focus on Kosinski's sexuality.\nThe book was also reviewed in academic journals. Thomas S. Gladsky writing for The Polish Review noted that the subject is difficult to write due to its controversial nature, but commended Sloan for \"doing much to assuage all those who have a stake\" in the matter. He also notes that the work focuses on the more challenging issue of Kosinski's life rather than his works, which can make some readers interested in literary criticism disappointed. He also noted that some bibliographical notes, while in general, extensive, can be seen as selective and with surprising attribution. He praises the book for \"emphasis in the cultural context\" (Kosinski's Polish-Jewish heritage), which he argues was until now mostly missing from \"Kosinski scholarship\". Regarding controversies surrounding authorship, Sloan, according to Gladsky, sholas that while there \"may have been ethical misjudgments on Kosinski part... no convincing evidence has surfaced to suggest that the works are anything but Kosinski's\". In conclusion, Gladsky writes readers can learn much about Kosinski from this work, and that Sloan shows Kosinski's reputation and art to be genuine and memorable if not accomplished or monumental.\nDavid T. Pfenninger reviewed the book for the Journal of Constructivist Psychology. Noting that \"Sloan admires his subject\", he praised the work arguing that the it is a \"wonderful biography\", a \"rich psychological study\" and that the author \"has written a remarkably researched and nuanced book that strangely flows like a novel, with an added dimension of scholarly analysis woven seamlessly into the text\". A psychologist, Pfenninger comments also on a number of related topics, such as Kosinski's sexuality, including  his plausible Oedipus complex of Kosinski.\nSee also\nThe Ugly Black Bird\n",

    "The 1925 medal for Schedel\nJosef Maria Schedel (10 January 1856 \u2013 7 April 1943) was a German apothecary, naturalist and collector. He worked in Japan and China from where he collected natural history specimens particularly of molluscs and art for German collectors.\nLife and work\nDeutsche Apotheke, Yokohoma, c. 1900\nSchedel was born out of wedlock in Bamberg to physician Heinrich Heinkelmann (1807\u20131866) and Justina Wilhelmina Schedel (1837\u20131857), daughter of a Bamberg lawyer. His mother died shortly after his birth and he was raised by a laundress. He went to high school and then apprenticed at the Einhorn pharmacy from 1873. In 1880 he went to study natural sciences in Munich and in the next year he went to the University of Kiel and became a chemical assistant to August Friedrich Karl Himly. In 1884 he became a pharmacist near Charlottenburg. In 1886 he went to Japan to work with the Japan Dispensary Brett & Co and after his contract ended he purchased a French pharmacy that he converted to his own Deutsche Apotheke in Yokohama. He was a member of the German society for natural history and ethnology of east Asia and a friend of Otto Keil and German agent August Langfeldt. He returned to Germany in 1899 and gave talks about his experiences in Japan. In 1900 he moved to Munich and ran a pharmacy there but closed down in 1902 following attempted blackmail for homosexuality. He then moved through Bavaria and in 1909 and then moved to work in Tientsin, China. He did not like work conditions and his health was poor. In addition China declared war on Germany in 1917 and with serious nervous disorders he returned to Germany in 1922.  He lived in seclusion in Bamberg until his death.\nSchedel was a friend of Magnus Hirschfeld, who founded the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee (WHC) in 1897. Schedel was invited to speak on homosexuality in Japan at the WHC in 1903. He also collected Japanese erotica. In 1925 he was awarded the \"Bene merenti\" medal of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences for his Chinese antiquities donated to the museum in Munich.\n",

    "Pierre de Mornay (Latin: Petrus de Mornevo; died 29 May 1306) was a French bishop of Orleans (1288\u20131296) and Auxerre (1296\u20131306) and chancellor of France (1304\u20131306).\nLife\nPierre de Mornay was the second son of Guillaume de Mornay, a knight whose estate was at Mornay near N\u00e9rondes in Berri (now Cher). His older brother Jean inherited the estate and became lord of Fert\u00e9-Nabert. Pierre studied law in Orl\u00e9ans. He may have served as the almoner of King Louis\u00a0IX and served the Crown in some capacity under Philip\u00a0III. He was a dean (French: doyen) of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois in Paris by 1278 and made archdeacon of Sologne and a canon of Orl\u00e9ans Cathedral in 1281. By 1286, he was a royal clerk (clerc) under Philip\u00a0IV and he was elected bishop of Orl\u00e9ans on 23 December 1288. Two contested elections regarding the diocese of Auxerre were annulled by Pope Boniface\u00a0VIII in 1294. He instead appointed the bishop of Orl\u00e9ans to hold the role in a bull dated 4 February 1296.\nPhilip\u00a0IV was committed to strengthening the position of the king of France. Pierre had helped him negotiate the 1295 Treaty of Anagni, ending Franco-Aragonese fighting during the War of the Sicilian Vespers and bringing himself to papal attention. By 1295, the king's other efforts had begun a war with England over Aquitaine and caused unrest in Flanders. Philip\u00a0IV responded in part by levying a 10% tax (decime) on church income without first securing the necessary approvals from the Papacy, as he had in 1288. Pierre de Mornay was obliged by the church to defend its position against the king, codified in the 1296 bull Clericis laicos. Philip\u00a0IV responded with an embargo against any export of gold or silver from France, effectively cutting Rome off from its French revenue while the Colonna family revolted against Boniface. Boniface yielded over a series of bulls, threatening excommunication while effectively pledging to approve reasonable taxation in Ineffabilis amor, allowing \"voluntary\" \"donations\" from a country's clergy without papal approval during times of emergency in Romana mater ecclesia, and finally capitulating entirely to Philip's position in the 1297 Etsi de statu and canonization of Louis\u00a0IX.\nPierre de Mornay was involved with negotiations with the English at Gisors in November 1297 with Guillaume de M\u00e2con, bishop of Amiens, John\u00a0II, duke of Brittany, Guy de Chatillon, count of St-Pol and constable of France, and Raoul de Clermont, lord of Nesles; at Montreuil in 1299 with Gilles, archbishop of Narbonne, Robert\u00a0II, duke of Burgundy, Pierre Flotte, Pierre de Belleperche, and Guy de Chatillon; and at Paris in 1302 and 1303 with the dukes of Brittany and Burgundy and with Philip's chamberlain Pierre the Fat. De Mornay was also involved in the negotiations to end the Franco-Flemish War and named Philip's chancellor in 1304.\nHe died at R\u00e9gennes in Appoigny on 29 May 1306.\nArms\nHis coat of arms was listed as a black lion morn\u00e9 with gold crown over 8 bands of silver and gold (Fasc\u00e9 de huit pi\u00e8ces d'argent et de geueles, au lion morn\u00e9 de sable, couronn\u00e9 d'or, brochant sur le tout).\n",

    "Railway station in New Zealand\nWaitara Road railway station is a rural railway station on the modern day Waitara Branch railway serving the small locality of Brixton in New Zealand's Taranaki district. It previously served the Waitara Taranaki Co-operative Dairy Company and plant nurseries Duncan and Davies Ltd.\nIt is now the main working base for the Waitara Railway Preservation Society who run heritage services on the line.\nHistory\nThe original railway station was opened in around 1883, 8 years after the opening of the New Plymouth - Waitara railway. The station was located at the crossing of Waitara Road and was opened primarily to serve the Waitara Road Dairy Factory, the first such factory in the district.\nThe station first appeared in timetables in 1882 as a flag station or stopping place for trains but it wasn't until 1883 that plans for a 12 wagon loop were submitted. In both 1893 and 1894, urgent requests were received for the provision of a shelter shed. But it would be November 1896 when estimates for a passenger platform and shelter shed were received, and September 1897 when the passenger platform and shelter were finally opened. \nBy the turn of the century, that station was described as having an accommodation shelter shed & passenger platform (southern side), a loading bank for goods and a 16-wagon loop for delivering goods. Issues remained for customers dropping off or picking up their deliveries, caused by a small loading bank and an open drain close by making cart parking tight, and also that sacks of grain, potatoes and other heavy goods were often dumped at the station building or platform on the opposite side of the track from the cart access, meaning customers had to try and back their cart over the railway line to collect their goods. This wasn't rectified until 1926 when the coal shed from Turakina was relocated as a goods shed at Waitara Road (with the addition of a verandah) - work wish was costed at approximately \u00a3102.\nDecline and closure\nIn the post-war years, much of the general traffic at Waitara Road station as motor vehicles became more affordable. The first to go was passenger services, which were replaced with Road Services buses. Next to go was the goods shed, which was removed in late 1957. \nWhile general traffic was falling, industrial traffic continued to keep the station running. Increasing traffic from the dairy factory (a result of the factory becoming Clifton Co-Operative Dairy Company and taking over several smaller companies in the area) led to new loading warehouses being built on the former goods yard in the 1960s and a progressive expansion in the factory size. \nAlso in the late 1970s, a new siding was laid to serve the plant nursery Duncan & Davies, which had relocated directly south of the station & shipped plants both nationally and internationally.\nBy the 1980s traffic began to drop. The dairy factory (which in 1980 became the Brixton complex for Moa-Nui Co-operative Dairies) closed in the early 1990s after over a century and Duncan & Davies stopped sending by rail, before going out of business completely. \nWaitara Road station on 30 August 1974, showing the Clifton Co-Operative Dairy Company factory and the new Duncan and Davies nurseries (prior to the siding being laid).\nThe station remained technically open until 2 February 1999 when Tranz Rail closed the entire line.\nToday\nThe station still exists as the Waitara Railway Preservation Society purchased the line in 2001 and established its main base at Waitara Road.\nSince then passenger facilities have been reinstated (including 2 former NZR station buildings from Tahora and Wait\u014dtara) and new sidings have been laid (including lifting and reusing the track from the Duncan and Davies siding).  Passenger services stop at the station during running days.\nThe neighbouring dairy factory complex still exists but is now used as a truck depot.\n",

    "2002 role-playing video game\n2002 video game\nShin Megami Tensei J, also released as Shin Megami Tensei EZ, was a role-playing video game developed and published by Atlus. It is part of the Megami Tensei series, and was released for Japanese feature phones starting on April 1, 2002, through a monthly subscription.\nPlayers would explore three dungeons in 3D, where they could fight demons, aided by a demon guardian summoned into their character's body, and search for treasure; there also existed a multiplayer mode, where players across Japan could battle each other one-on-one. The game was well received for the replay value of the randomly generated dungeons and for the amount of player options.\nGameplay\nPlayers could explore three randomly generated 3D dungeons and fight demons encountered there.\nShin Megami Tensei J was a 3D dungeon-crawling role-playing video game, which consisted of two types of segments that players could alternate between: in the preparation segments, players could learn new magic and skills, and buy and sell items and equipment. In the exploration segments, they could navigate three dungeons in first person in the demon world, whose randomly generated layouts would shift each time they were entered: the World of Gluttony, the World of Envy, and the World of Sloth.\nPlayers would search the dungeons for treasure chests containing items and equipment, with the goal of reaching the lowest floor and capturing each area; as they moved across tiles, a map would gradually automatically fill out to show the layout of the areas they had visited. Throughout the dungeons, they would encounter recovery springs where they could restore their health. Players could also re-enter already completed dungeons to replay them as they wish. While exploring, players would encounter enemy demons, which they fought in a turn-based battle system.\nPlayers could summon guardian demons into their character's body to help them in battle: they accessed one when first starting the game, after having chosen of the three alignments law, neutral, or chaos. New and stronger guardian demons could be summoned through the use of guardian cards found in the dungeons; the guardian demons could also be improved through battling, which would earn them experience points and raise their level.\nIn addition to the single-player dungeon exploration, players could have one-on-one guardian demon battles with others across Japan in the multiplayer battle arena mode, and compete to be the best in the country.\nRelease and reception\nShin Megami Tensei J was developed and published by Atlus, and was released for Japanese feature phones starting on April 1, 2002, as part of the launch of their platform Atlus Web-J on J-Phone's service J-Sky Java, where it was available as a monthly subscription; users could also access Megami Tensei wallpapers and music through the platform. This version of the game was split across two applications: the \"basics app\" for the preparation segments, and the \"demon world app\" for the dungeon crawling, requiring the user to exit one application and launch the other to switch between the two parts of the game.\nThe game was updated to add the multiplayer battle arena mode on July 19, 2002, and on July 22, 2004, it was also released through their Atlus Web-EZ platform on KDDI's EZweb service, under the title Shin Megami Tensei EZ. At launch, this version was only compatible with Toshiba's A1304T/TII phones, with support for further models added later. In August 2004, support was added for Java ME phones, in addition to the initial BREW release.\nNLab called Shin Megami Tensei J a \"must-play\" game for series fans, and Dengeki Online and Comptiq described it as a \"full-fledged\" Shin Megami Tensei game and a proper role-playing game; Game Watch thought it captured one of the big appeals of the Shin Megami Tensei series through the large amount of demons appearing in the game. NLab liked the randomly generated dungeons, saying that it keeps the game feeling fresh, and appreciated the amount of options available to players, enabling different play styles. They also liked the smoothly scrolling graphics, making the dungeon exploration comfortable. Sina liked the combat system for being easy to operate.\nNotes\n^ Shin Megami Tensei J (Japanese: \u771f\u30fb\u5973\u795e\u8ee2\u751f-J, \"True Goddess Reincarnation J\")\n^ Shin Megami Tensei EZ (\u771f\u30fb\u5973\u795e\u8ee2\u751f-EZ, \"True Goddess Reincarnation EZ\")\n^ \"Basics app\" (\u57fa\u672c\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea, kihon apuri)\n^ \"Demon world app\" (\u9b54\u754c\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea, makai apuri)\n",
    "Spanish politician\nFor the Puerto Rican politician, see Carlos L\u00f3pez Rivera.\nCarlos Rivera Rivera (born 1955 or 1956) is a Spanish independent politician who has been mayor of Torremocha de Jarama in the Community of Madrid since the first democratic elections in 1979.\nBiography\nRivera studied for seven years in a seminary and said in 2021 that he would consider priesthood when he leaves politics. He was 23 when he was first elected mayor, having been prompted to run by negative local events such as the closing of his town's only school in 1974.\nDuring Rivera's mandate, his town grew from 140 inhabitants to over 1,000. He set up a public-run retirement home and a co-operative for the elderly. The town also accommodated a children's home that had been rejected by other municipalities, as well as public housing to prevent the emigration of young people.\nRivera is not paid for his role as mayor, instead working as a civil servant and as a secretary in four nearby town councils. While the law calls for council sessions to be held at least every three months, he holds them monthly, so that any councillor unable to attend once does not have to wait half a year. Rivera has faced some local criticism for his long administration, being called a Cacique, a Spanish term for a political boss; he responded by saying \"every four years the Cacique goes to the polls. And the residents, who are very smart, keep voting for the same Cacique\".\nIn 2013, Rivera was acquitted in a legal battle of over a decade, centring around the paving of livestock roads. Prosecutors had demanded a four-year prison sentence, disqualification from public office and \u20ac100,000 compensation. The court found that Rivera allowed the works as they had been approved by the Community of Madrid.\nRivera was one of 31 mayors to retain their post for the first 40 years of democracy in local elections in Spain. He and another mayor in the Community of Madrid, Luis Partida of Villanueva de la Ca\u00f1ada, retained an absolute majority in that time.\n",
    "Cemetery in Somerset County, England\nGlastonbury Cemetery is a cemetery in Glastonbury, Somerset, England. It was established in 1854\u201355 and is maintained by Glastonbury Town Council.\nThe cemetery lodge and its two mortuary chapels became Grade II listed buildings in 1977.\nHistory\nEstablishment of cemetery\nGlastonbury Cemetery depicted on an Ordnance Survey map from 1904.\nGlastonbury Cemetery was established at a time when the burial space in the churchyards of St John's and St Benedict's were reaching full capacity. Furthermore, new burial space was considered essential for the town as the population, including in the surrounding villages, was expected in increase in the future. A vestry meeting in October 1853 resolved to establish a cemetery and saw the formation of the Glastonbury Burial Board. A number of sites were considered by the Board, including the fields to the north of St John's, Fisher's Hill, Wearyall Hill and Edmund Hill.\nEdmund Hill, which was the Burial Board's favoured site, was subsequently chosen at a vestry meeting on 3 August 1854, although there was some regret that a suitable site closer to the town could not have been found. The same meeting saw the estimated costs for purchasing the land, constructing the cemetery, its chapels and lodge, passed. The site was then inspected and formally approved by the government during the following month. The plans for the cemetery's lodge, entrance gateway and two mortuary chapels (one for the Church of England and one for nonconformists) were drawn up by the architect Charles Edmund Giles of Taunton.\nConstruction of the cemetery commenced in late 1854 and was completed in 1855. On 5 October 1854, tenders were sought by the Burial Board for the \"erection of two chapels and an entrance gateway in the new burial ground\". The Board then invited tenders for \"road-making, draining and other works\" on 16 November 1854, followed by the \"erection of a lodge and gateway\" on 18 January 1855.\nThe cemetery's lodge and entrance gateway of 1855.\nThe first burial took place at the cemetery on 2 April 1855. The Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. Lord Auckland, consecrated the Church of England section of the cemetery on 8 August 1856.\nExtensions\nBy the end of the 19th century, the consecrated section of the cemetery was virtually full and new burials had to be made \"in odd corners, and in parts of the footpath\". It was reported in March 1900 that there were 26 consecrated spaces and 203 unconsecrated spaces remaining. A vestry meeting held in September 1899 decided to proceed with plans to enlarge the cemetery by purchasing approximately three acres of adjoining land on the north side. The purchase of the land cost \u00a3500 and a further \u00a3450 was spent on fencing, planting and laying out the ground.\nThe work was carried out in 1901\u201302, after the Burial Board invited tenders for \"draining, path-making, and other works\" on 23 October 1901. The Church of England section of the extension was consecrated on 9 May 1902. The Assistant Bishop of Bath and Wells, Bishop Stirling, performed the consecration on behalf of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. George Kennion, who was unable to attend due to illness.\nThe cemetery received another extension in 1999, when the Glastonbury and Sharpham Burial Joint Committee acquired additional land above the existing site from Mendip District Council. The extension provided the cemetery with further plot space for an additional 50 years, and has included a section used for green burials since 2005, the Edmund Hill Green Burial Site.\nMortuary chapels\nThe cemetery's two mortuary chapels.\nThe cemetery's two mortuary chapels fell into disuse in the mid-20th century and were under threat of demolition in February 1977, when Glastonbury Town Council voted to demolish rather than repair them. By this time, the Church of England chapel saw infrequent use only and the nonconformist chapel was used as a store. The estimated repair costs were deemed prohibitive and it was feared the buildings would become a \"danger to the public\".\nIn March 1977, following pressure from Glastonbury's mayor and councillor Hugh Barker and the Council for the Protection of Rural England, Mendip District Council placed a preservation order on them, thereby halting demolition for six months while an application was made for their potential designation as listed buildings. Both of the chapels, along with the cemetery lodge, became Grade II listed buildings on 2 August 1977.\nDespite the new protective status, Glastonbury and Sharpham Burial Joint Committee sought listed building consent from the District Council and a faculty from the Diocese of Bath and Wells for the demolition of both chapels. The plans were met with both local opposition and from organisations such as the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Ancient Monuments Society and the Victorian Society. The District Council rejected the plans in September 1977, concluding it would \"r",

Initially sentenced to death, his sentence was later commuted to 25 years imprisonment, and he was released in 2017.\nEarly life\nYuri Ivanovich Artamonov was born in 1975 in the village of Kechevo, Udmurt ASSR, into a poor family with many children. He grew up without a father and was physically abused by his strict and cruel mother. During his school years, Artamonov had no interest in studying and constantly got mediocre grades. After graduating from high school, he enrolled in a rural vocational school, where he studied to be a tractor driver.\nIn 1993, he was drafted to serve in the Russian Army and was stationed in the Far East. Upon his return, he moved in with his wife and parents in the Oktyabrsky District of Izhevsk, where the couple soon had a daughter. During this period, Artamonov began to experience financial difficulties and had trouble finding a job, which prompted him to turn to crime. He soon bought a hatchet, work clothes, and cotton gloves, as well as a revolver he got from the black market. He then stored all these items in a hiding place not far from his house.\nMurders\nAs his modus operandi, Artamonov operated only during the winter, where he could wear his overalls and pretend to be a plumber who needed to \"check\" the heating systems of elderly people. At a convenient moment, he would strike the victim several times on the head with an axe and then take everything valuable from the dwelling. Artamonov would then give the stolen items and jewelry to his wife and mother-in-law and spend the money on himself and his family. His main area of operation was in the neighborhoods of Mayskaya Street and 10 Years of October.\nHis first murder took place on October 25, 1995. Having read in a newspaper that Irina Mezhueva, a 36-year-old resident of the Ustinovsky District, wanted to buy a car, he called the phone number listed in the ad and learned her address. On the next day, disguised as a plumber, Artamonov went to her home and was invited inside. He asked Mezhueva to lock her Dobermann in a room, claiming that he was afraid of dogs, and then pretended to inspect the pipes and radiators for a while before asking her to pour him some water. When Mezhueva went to the kitchen, Artamonov followed her and struck her four times on the head with the axe's butt and blade, fracturing her skull and destroying her brain. After killing her, he stole 12 million rubles, a video recorder, five video tapes, and gold earrings.\nInitially, Irina's husband, Sergei, was considered the prime suspect after a neighbor's little girl told police that she had heard a woman's screams shortly after he had returned home. While Sergei claimed that he was somewhere else at the crime scene, an inspection revealed that this was untrue. In addition, investigators checked the house of some of his close relatives, where they found an axe almost identical to the murder weapon. Finally, it was noted that the dog seemed to not be alerted by the criminal, who had evidently been willingly invited into the house. While Sergei's guilt seemed obvious at first glance, investigators noticed that there were too many inconsistencies and eventually released him after he was detained for five months.\nIn 1996, Artamonov committed two more murders and one attempted murder. On March 27, he killed a 68-year-old former English teacher, and on the next day, he unsuccessfully attempted to rob that same house. On October 4, he was caught stealing sheep in Malaya Purga, for which he was sentenced to 4 years probation. On February 7, 1997, Artamonov was met with fierce resistance during another attack, as a result of which he dropped his axe and hat at the crime scene, leaving traces of blood and his own hair.\nOn February 19, Artamonov killed a 72-year-old woman, and two days later, he killed his final victim, a 65-year-old pensioner who lived on a nearby street.\nThe so-called \"Plumber murders\" led to a public outcry and moral panic in the city, leading to people becoming increasingly vigilant and police officers detaining dozens of suspicious people after receiving calls from alarmed citizens. In the winter of 1997, the investigation released an identikit of the perpetrator, compiled from the testimony of surviving victims, which proved to be very similar to Artamonov.\nArrest, investigation and trial\nArtamonov was arrested at a marketplace on March 7, 1997, while attempting to sell a power planer he had stolen from one of the victims. He almost immediately confessed to all the crimes, and he was eventually charged with 21 crimes, including five murders, four attempted murders, and a series of thefts and robberies. A forensic psychiatric examination found him to be sane, an",

After failing to become a professional speedway rider he took up various jobs before finding his way into the promotion of speedway.\nThomas and his business partner Jeff Brownhut founded Workington Comets after a successful application was made by for a licence to race at Derwent Park for the 1970 season. The move is credited in helping the Workington Town rugby league club avert financial troubles. The rugby pitch required moving 25 yards sideways to accommodate the speedway track.\nThomas started a company called Premier Sporting Promotions and in 1971 began to bring entertainment acts such as Ken Dodd to Derwent Park. In 1971, he also brought speedway back to Hull, when the Hull Vikings began to race at the Boulevard Stadium. It was at Hull that he formed a promoting partnership with Wally Mawdsley.\nIn 1974, Thomas bought the defunct Sunderland Gladiators licence and transferred it to re-form the Newcastle Diamonds, entering the team to race in the 1975 New National League season.\nThomas was named the manager of the England team in December 1979, to work alongside Eric Boocock, who was named coach and technical adviser. As England team manager he saw the international success, which included winning the 1980 Speedway World Team Cup and 1980 Speedway World Pairs Championship.\nHis career took a dive after he incurred financial losses of \u00a340,000 with Newcastle during the 1984 season. He was forced to sell his house before launching a new promotion company. He returned to speedway organising ice speedway with co-promoter Graham Drury at Telford before working with Tony Mole in bringing back Workington Comets to race in the 1999 Premier League. Workington experienced a golden era, winning multiple trophies from 1999 to 2010.\nThomas died from cancer in 2011.\n",

    "Indian musician and composer (1910\u20131999)\nAleixo Piedade Fernandes (10 January 1910 \u2013 30 August 1999), known professionally as Alex Mestri, was an Indian musician, composer, violinist, bandleader, and music director who worked on the Konkani stage.\nEarly life\nFernandes during his youth\nAleixo Piedade Fernandes was born on 10 January 1910, in Marg\u00e3o, Goa, which was a part of Portuguese India during the era of the Portuguese Empire. He was born into a Goan Catholic family. Fernandes was the son of day laborers Pedro Rosario and Joaquina Fernandes, who hailed from Navelim. He finished his initial undergraduate studies, referred to as \"Premeiro Grau\" in Portuguese. Additionally, he pursued English education up to the seventh grade at Union High School in Marg\u00e3o, now called Loyola High School. From an early age of 14, Fernandes exhibited an interest in music, dedicating himself to the study of musical composition, notation, and violin performance. His strong affinity for tiatr, a distinctive form of Goan musical theater, fueled his aspiration to compose music specifically for this genre. Encouraged by his father, Fernandes embarked on a musical journey that would shape his career.\nCareer\nPrior to his tenure as a composer for tiatrs, Fernandes initiated his musical journey by establishing a musical ensemble known as \"Alex and his Jolly Boys Orchestra\" in 1930, when he was merely 20 years old. The band flourished during its early days, gaining recognition for its performances at weddings, dances, and eventually becoming an integral part of the tiatr scene for two decades. Consisting of five musicians, including Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues on the trumpet, hailing from Quelossim, Bernard Fernandes on the saxophone and trumpet, hailing from Cortalim, Cheddo on drums, hailing from Maddel Grande in Marg\u00e3o, and Joaquim Silva on the banjo, who hailed from Borda, Goa, the musical group eventually dissolved, prompting Fernandes to gather a new set of members to form a fresh lineup. The subsequent iteration of the band saw the inclusion of Raia-based Gaspar, John Carvalho, Paix\u00e3o hailing from Nuvem, Jack Minguel based in Fatorda and Piedade Santan from Colva. Fernandes, who had prior employment at a school in Nuvem and used to commute by bicycle, chose to resign from his teaching position to focus on his musical performances at weddings, dances, and tiatrs. The demand for his band was such that they were consistently booked well in advance throughout the year. In response to this high demand, Fernandes expanded the ensemble to comprise a total of twelve musicians. In cases of conflicting schedules, he would strategically divide the band into two groups, ensuring that one group of six members could entertain guests at one event while the other group of six members performed at a separate venue. Fernandes established himself as a popular musician, becoming sought after for his musical services during that period. Whether it was weddings, dances, or tiatrs, his musical abilities made him a sought-after figure. The Navhind Times lauded Fernandes as a musician, underscoring his popularity in the realms of weddings, dances, and tiatrs.\nFernandes demonstrated a strong enthusiasm for singing and acting, which was prominently displayed in his participation in local village tiatrs. He had the opportunity to showcase his musical talents through his involvement in theatrical performances that took place during festive occasions and important events, where he performed alongside local village boys. The Konkani actor and playwright, A. R. Souza Ferr\u00e3o, played a pivotal role in guiding Fernandes into the realm of commercial tiatrs as a musician. Initially, Fernandes received a modest compensation of \u20b920 (equivalent to \u20b92,200 or US$28 in 2023) for his musical contributions, a sum that was later augmented to \u20b925 (equivalent to \u20b92,800 or US$35 in 2023). Over time, he became a sought-after composer, collaborating with directors of the era such as Saib Rocha, A. R. Souza Ferr\u00e3o, and C. Alvares, among others. In 1958, Fernandes embarked on an African tour alongside his band and a tiatr troupe that included figures like Konkani comedian Jacinto Vaz, A. R. Souza Ferr\u00e3o, Remmie Cola\u00e7o, Anthony De Sa, Dioguinho D'Mello, Rico Rod, Aristides Dias, Lucian Dias, and Young Menezes. This journey encompassed 25 shows across diverse locations including Portuguese Angola, Dar es Salaam in the Tanganyika Territory, Kampala in the Protectorate of Uganda, Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru in Kenya Colony, and various others. Fernandes' musical contributions were not limited to his native Goa; he also lent his talents to tiatrs in Bombay, Poona, Karwar, Mangalore, and Belgaum, thereby expanding his artistic reach.\nFernandes was a popular figure within the realm of tiatr, a form of Goan musical theater. Among his band members was Francisco Antonio, also known as Frans Anton, who initiated his drumming career in tiatrs when he was merely 15 years old, performing alongside Fernandes and",

After returning to China, Qin served as the director and later counsellor of the Information Department, for four years.\nQin was appointed as the deputy permanent representative and counselor of the Chinese Mission to the United Nations Office at Geneva, Switzerland in 1984, and from 1987 to 1990, he served as the permanent representative, ambassador, and party secretary of the Chinese Mission to the United Nations Office at Vienna, Austria. From 1990 to 1993, he served as the Director General of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences within the ministry and in 1993, he was appointed as the Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nPermanent Representative of China to the United Nations\nQin was appointed as the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations in July 1995, succeeding Li Zhaoxing. During his tenure, in January 1997, China vetoed a UN Security Council resolution which would have sent United Nations peacekeeping forces to Guatemala to monitor a peace agreement which bought an end to the Guatemalan Civil War due to Guatemalan government inviting Taiwanese officials to the peace ceremony and Taiwan's diplomatic ties with Guatemala. China again used its veto in February 1999 to block sending United Nations peacekeeping forces to Macedonia after Macedonia established diplomatic ties with Taiwan. These two vetoes were the fourth and fifth vetoes used by China in the Security Council. Qin was elected as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and became a member of the foreign affairs committee in March 1998.\nWhen 11 countries which had diplomatic ties with Taiwan endorsed Taiwan's bid to the United Nations on 24 July 1998, Qin wrote a letter to then United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan where he criticized the countries for their \"brazen attempt\" to \"split a sovereign state.\" On 7 May 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia when the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, was bombed by the United States, resulting in the deaths of three Chinese nationals, Qin termed the bombing \"barbarian\" and convened an emergency Security Council meeting in response to the bombing. His tenure also saw humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and East Timor. He stepped down as permanent representative in February 2000.\nLater life\nQin retired in 2004. In 2010, he published his book Ambassador's Memoir: Representing China in the UN, which recounted his experiences as permanent representative.

It is a located on a 256\u00a0m (840\u00a0ft) high hill.\nArnsberg castle was constructed as the seat of the counts of Werl-Arnsberg, probably around 1100. It served as residence of the counts of Arnsberg until 1368. With the transition of the county into the possession of the Electorate of Cologne, it became the centre of power of the Duchy of Westphalia. The electors resided, hunted and feasted there during their visits, the Landdrost had his seat there as governor, and partially the provincial assemblies also took place there.\nElector Salentin of Isenburg (1532\u20131610) had the castle redesigned in the renaissance style around 1575. Under Maximilian Henry of Bavaria (1621\u20131688), there was another renovation in 1654. A fundamental redesign in the baroque style took place from 1739 onwards under Elector Clemens August of Bavaria (1700\u20131761) with help of the architect Johann Conrad Schlaun (1695\u20131773), creating a cheerful palace and hunting lodge. Arnsberg castle was destroyed in 1762 during the Seven Years' War.\nToday, the complex is a castle ruin and can be freely visited.\nHistory\nExcavations at the ruins of Arnsberg castle in 2023\nThe development and construction history of the complex can be traced more precisely through artistic representations, plans, and descriptions only since the 16th century. Only a larger-scale archaeological investigation could provide insights into earlier phases of construction. Excavations in 2023 revealed medieval wall structures, which may have belonged to an early ring wall.\nMedieval castle: the \"Grafenburg\"\nThe castle hill from a distance\nThe entrance to the castle today\nThe castle well\nThe early history of the complex is largely obscure. Around 1060, count Bernhard II of Werl (1010\u20131070) built the so-called old castle, also known as \"R\u00fcdenburg\", on a hill at the confluence of the Walpke and Ruhr rivers. Between 1070 and 1080, Konrad II (1040\u20131092) relocated the seat of the Counts of Werl to Arnsberg. Earlier, the construction of the \"Grafenburg\" (i.e., the location of the current castle ruins) on the hill opposite \"R\u00fcdenburg\" was attributed to him, with the year of origin given as 1077. Today, the relocation of the Count's seat from Werl to Arnsberg is attributed to Count Friedrich the Belligerent (1075\u20131124) around 1100.\nIn 1102, a castle in the area of present-day Arnsberg was destroyed by Frederick I, Archbishop of Cologne (1075\u20131131), because count Friedrich had sided with Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV (1050\u20131106) during the Investiture Controversy. According to Leidinger, this was the \"R\u00fcdenburg\", not, as stated in older literature, the \"Grafenburg\".\nAnother destruction of the castle occurred in 1166 under the rule of count Heinrich I, whose brother's murder triggered a punitive campaign by Henry the Lion (1129/31-1195). A third destruction occurred in 1366 during a feud between count Gottfried IV of Arnsberg (1295\u20131371) and count Engelbert III of the Mark (1330\u20131391). In both cases, the castle was rebuilt.\nLittle is known about the appearance of the medieval castle. It is likely that even then, a main building with strong corner towers enclosed the castle area to the south. The first indications of a castle chapel date back to 1114. The castle was the nucleus of the town of Arnsberg, which emerged from a small settlement of vassals and craftsmen. The castle itself was the residential and administrative centre of the County of Arnsberg. In two documents from 1259 and 1270, an \"aurea caminata\" (a golden hall) is mentioned, indicating a partly representative furnishing. The construction of a three-aisled chapel and the layout of the main tower also hint at a magnificent complex.\n16th century: Salentin of Isenburg and the creation of a renaissance castle\nAfter the sale of the County of Arnsberg to the Electorate of Cologne in 1368, as count Gottfried IV was childless and last of his line, the castle served as the residence of the Archbishops of Cologne when they visited the Duchy of Westphalia. During the Soest Feud (1444\u20131449), it served as the main base for the troops of Archbishop Dietrich II von Moers (1385\u20131463). During the following period, the castle was little used and fell into disrepair.\nInitially, there were no changes to the structural condition. This changed only when a redesign was carried out under Elector Salentin of Isenburg (1532\u20131610) in 1575. The defensive character, which was never completely lost in subsequent constructions, was preserved. The redesign focused on dismantling the roof and timberwork of the castle and reusing and integrating the walls for cost reasons. The plans for the renovation were provided by the archit",

    "Pedestrian tunnel in South Wales\nThe Ely Subway's route beneath the river, mapped by Ordnance Survey in 1965 (shortly after the tunnel's closure)\nThe Ely Subway is a disused pedestrian tunnel beneath the mouth of the River Ely in South Wales. \nOpened in 1900, it provided a direct connection between Penarth Dock and Grangetown until its closure in 1963.\nHistory\nPenarth Dock opened in 1865 on the southern edge of Cardiff Bay, at the mouth of the Ely. However, the nearest crossing over the river was a road bridge nearly a mile upstream at Llandough. The operators of the dock, the Taff Vale Railway Company, introduced a chain ferry across to the northern bank of the Ely as a shortcut for both their workers (many of whom lived in Grangetown) and members of the public. However, the ferry was unable to run in bad weather\u2014even sinking twice during storms\u2014and as the docks continued to develop in importance a permanent crossing was considered necessary.\nThe company submitted a bill to Parliament in 1896 seeking permission for a number of new works, one of which was a tunnel beneath the river to replace the ferry. Construction began in July 1897 on a subway designed by George Sibbering, the company's chief engineer, with works overseen by Thomas Taylor, a contractor from Pontypridd. The ramped entrances at either end were dug by hand but the majority of the route\u2014325 yards of the subway's total length of 400 yards\u2014was tunneled with a Greathead shield, of the same design used for the Central London Railway. The northern entrance was located at the southern end of Ferry Road in Grangetown (next to some large petroleum storage tanks owned by the Bear Creek Oil Company), while the southern entrance was next to the dockside Mission Church.\nThe tunneling process was slow and difficult. The ground was largely a loose mixture of mud, gravel, and clay, and the cast-iron tunnel\u2014only 11 feet below the river bed at its deepest point\u2014was subjected to intense differentials in pressure between high and low tides in the bay above. The tunnel flooded twice during construction, in November 1897 and December 1898, although workers were able to evacuate both times without any loss of life. Tunneling finished on 25 September 1899, and a ceremony was held to mark the subway's official opening on 14 May 1900. The total cost of construction was between \u00a325,000 and \u00a326,000.\nThe subway had a diameter of 10 feet 6 inches, with a usable footpath 6 feet wide, and 7 feet 6 inches of headroom. Each side of the tunnel ramped downwards relatively steeply from the entrances, with a gradient of 1 in 7, until meeting in the middle. The interior was painted with a mixture of white enamel and granulated cork to prevent condensation, and lit with electric bulbs. Toll keepers oversaw turnstiles at either entrance, charging pedestrians a penny for entry, cyclists two pence, and prams four pence; horses also reportedly used the subway. It also carried gas and water pipes, and hydraulic lines for coal-loading machinery in the docks, while water leaking in from outside the tunnel was pumped away through drains in the floor. A burst pipe on 4 August 1902 caused a flood and led to the subway's temporary closure.\nThe subway was closed in 1936 as part of the wider closure of Penarth Dock, and the toll keepers were removed, but it was reopened and repurposed as an air raid shelter during the Second World War when the docks were requisitioned for the U.S. Navy.\nAfter the war the subway remained accessible to the public but increasingly fell into disrepair, and it gained a reputation for vandalism and petty crime. It was eventually closed and boarded up in 1963 as part of the wider decommissioning of Penarth Dock; the entrances were then bricked up in 1965. It continued to be used as a conduit for power cables by the South Wales Electricity Board until 1976, when part of the Penarth entrance was demolished and some of the cast iron tunnel sections were removed.\nPresent day\nThe demolished southern entrance was sealed over in the 1980s as part of the redevelopment of Penarth Dock into Penarth Marina\u2014the site is now Plas Pamir, a residential road. The bricked-up northern entrance is located within the grounds of Cardiff Bay Yacht Club.\nThe tunnel is not actively maintained, but (other than the damage to the southern entrance) remains intact. It was inspected in 1991 during the construction of the Cardiff Bay Barrage and found to be in good condition. However, renovating and reopening it was ultimately not pursued in favour of building Pont Y Werin\u2014a brand new footbridge around half a kilometre upstream\u2014instead.\nA commemorative mural of the subway, painted by local artists Peaceful Progress, can be found at the southern end of Pont Y Werin.\n",

It is one of seventeen known early medieval stones in Heysham, a concatenation which once caused this site to be called \"one of the most interesting in the country from the archaeological point of view\".  It is a product of the 10th-century Norse culture of the British Isles of which the precise purpose is not certainly known, though it may be a grave-marker.  The carvings on the stone have been the subject of much dispute, different scholars interpreting them as showing a hunting scene, the patriarch Adam, the Norse hero Sigurd, the end of the world in Norse myth, or as being intended to blend both Christian and pagan themes.  It has been called \"perhaps the best example of its kind in the country\".\nHistory\nSt Peter's Church, Heysham\nThe Heysham hogback is, like other hogbacks, a grave-marker, monument or perhaps cenotaph, dating from the 10th century and probably from the period 920\u2013950.  The man it commemorates is thought to have been a high-status individual connected with the Hiberno-Norse communities of Cumbria or Yorkshire, and its position on the coast suggests that he was a trader.\nThe first documentary record of the hogback is a mention in the 1811 edition of An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Town of Lancaster, published by Christopher Clark, of its discovery in St Peter's churchyard.  The 1807 edition of this work does not mention it, from which it has been argued that it must have been unearthed between those two years, but this inference has been disputed.  The same work claims that \"at the time of its discovery, there was found deposited under it, the remains of a human skeleton, and also, a piece of iron, which had apparently been the head of a spear\".  This, if true, would make it the only hogback found in association with human remains or grave goods.  A much later account in Edward L. Cutts's A Manual for the Study of the Sepulchral Slabs and Crosses of the Middle Ages (1849) surmises that it was found in the adjoining St Patrick's Chapel.\nIt was kept in the open air in St Peter's churchyard where it suffered erosion from the weather and from the many local children who, over the years, played at taking rides on it.  In 1961 it was taken into the church, where it remains.\nPhysical description\nFace A\nThe hogback's length is 205.8\u00a0cm (81.0\u00a0in), its width varies between 17.8\u00a0cm (7.0\u00a0in) and 20.3\u00a0cm (8.0\u00a0in), and its height between 33.0\u00a0cm (13.0\u00a0in) and 39.4\u00a0cm (15.5\u00a0in).  It is made of Ward's Stone sandstone, a pale brown millstone grit of the Silsden Formation which could have originated anywhere on the Morecambe Bay coast between Heysham and Bolton-le-Sands.  It is in good condition except on the ridge, which shows signs of wear.\nThe carvings\nThe hogback is carved on all sides with figures.  At each of the two ends is a beast with a head disproportionately large for its body-size and, unusually, with four legs \u2013 on most hogbacks only two are shown.  Face A is topped by a row of tegulae, i.e. tile shapes, below which is a roof area featuring amid abstract decoration a recumbent human figure, curly-tailed animal and a twisting snake-like shape.  The lower \"wall\" section is framed by four human figures, two on each side, with hands raised in the orans position; between the two humans on the right is a beast, possibly a dog, in a vertical position.  In the middle of the \"wall\" area, between the two groups of human figures, are five beasts, three of which are at \"ground\" level; one of these is identifiable as a stag with antlers.  Above \"ground\" level are two more beasts, one, perhaps a dog, standing on the stag's back and the other in an inverted position above one of the \"ground\"-level beasts.  Face B has, above, two rows of tegulae.  Beneath them, reading from left to right, are two beasts, one above the other, two large birds, a tree (?) with horizontal branches, a third bird, a human figure in the orans position, and on the furthest right two more beasts.\nInterpretation\nA \"diagrammatic restoration\" of the Heysham hogsback published in 1892. Face A above, face B below.\nThe very first published record of the Heysham hogback, in 1811, confessed that \"it is not so easy to discover the Artist's meaning in the figures represented thereon\".  This has not stopped scholars from forming theories, some of which were presented to the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society towards the end of the 19th century.  The archaeologist George Forrest Browne wrote in 1887 that the scenes depicted could scarcely be anything but an animal hunt, pictured for its own sake rather than as a religious allegory.  To this Thomas Lees objected that \"The persons are represented less as hunters than as themselve",
    "\nFlowers and Shadows is a novel by Ben Okri.,a Nigerian author who won the Booker\u2019s price award in 1991.The novel was set in Lagos. The novel portrays the realities of poverty and social lifestyle in Lagos. The protagonist, Jeffia, initially sheltered in wealth, confronts the darker aspects of his family's history and society's injustices. Themes of innocence versus experience, the legacy of family sins, and the resilience of hope amidst despair frequently appear throughout the novel. Through rich language and diverse characters, the novel explores the concept of beauty and brutality, ultimately offering a message of triumphant optimism despite society's shadows.\nPlot summary\nFlowers and Shadows focuses on the  journey of Jeffia, a privileged young man in Lagos, Nigeria. who confronts the realities of his family's past and the societal injustices surrounding him. Despite his pampered upbringing, Jeffia becomes increasingly aware of the violence and poverty plaguing the city's poorer quarters. \nAs Jeffia reflects deep into his family's history, he uncovers dark secrets and the legacy of his father's ruthless pursuit of power and wealth. The novel explores themes of innocence versus experience, as Jeffia grapples with the revelation of his father's violent nature and the impact it has had on his own life. Amidst the despair, Jeffia finds hope in Cynthia, a young woman whose resilience and love serve as a beacon of light in the darkness. Despite the odds stacked against them, their love story unfolds against the backdrop of Lagos's squalor and societal evils.\nThroughout the narrative, the contrast between beauty and brutality is well explored, with the title \"Flowers and Shadows\". Despite the challenges they face, Jeffia and Cynthia emerge as symbols of resilience and optimism, reminding readers of the enduring power of hope even in the face of adversity.\nLanguage choice\nLanguage choice of this novel vividly portrays life in Lagos, Nigeria, and its inhabitants. The novel exhibits a rich blend of English, incorporating both standard English and that of Nigerian pidgin. The language choice reflects the novel's exploration of societal contrasts, from Jeffia's privileged world to the gritty realities of Lagos's impoverished neighborhoods.\nJeffia's privileged upbringing is reflected in his speech, while the voices of the marginalized are audible with the rhythms of pidgin. This linguistic diversity adds depth to the characters and authenticity to their interactions.\nSetting\nThe novel unfolds against the backdrop of Lagos, Nigeria, a sprawling metropolis characterized by its vibrant energy and contrasts. The novel paints a vivid portrait of the city's diverse neighborhoods, from the affluent enclaves of the elite to the impoverished slums teeming with life.\nIn the affluent quarters where Jeffia resides,  privilege reign supreme. Lavish mansions, gated communities, and upscale shopping districts provide a contrast to poverty that plague other parts of the city. the wealthy navigate a world of luxury and excess, insulated from the harsh realities faced by the majority.\nHowever, the novel also delves into the underbelly of Lagos, where poverty, violence, and despair are present. The poorer quarters are depicted with gritty realism, with crowded streets, dilapidated buildings, and open sewers serving as a  reminder of the city's social inequalities. In these neighborhoods, residents struggle to eke out a living amidst the chaos and uncertainty of daily life.\nThrough vivid descriptions and evocative imagery, the novel captures the sensory experience of Lagos, from the bustling markets and chaotic traffic jams to the vibrant street life and bustling waterfront. The setting serves as more than just a backdrop, it is a dynamic and integral part of the narrative, shaping the characters' experiences and influencing the course of their lives.\nOverall, Flowers and Shadows presents Lagos as a city of contrasts, where beauty and brutality coexist in a delicate balance, and where the resilience of the human spirit shines through amidst the chaos and despair.\n",
    "Palestinian-German professor, chemist and wood scientist\nEdmone Roffael (1939\u20132021) was a Palestinian-German chemist and wood scientist, and former professor at the Georg-August University of G\u00f6ttingen, who made noteworthy contributions to clarifying the release of formaldehyde from particleboard and MDF products, and its emission reduction. \nRoffael was also an elected fellow of the International Academy of Wood Science.\nFrom 1993 to 2005, Roffael served as the head of the Department of Wood Chemistry and Wood Technology at the Institute of Wood Biology and Wood Technology, Faculty of Forest Sciences and Forest Ecology at the Georg-August University of G\u00f6ttingen.\nBiography\nEdmone Roffael was born on December 31, 1939, in Tulkarm, Palestine. Initially, he studied chemistry in Egypt at University of Alexandria and Cairo University, as well as at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. \nAfter completing his studies, he obtained a Ph.D. in cellulose chemistry from TU Darmstadt in 1968, with a dissertation titled \"X-ray and infrared investigations on the orderliness of cellulose.\" Subsequently, he worked from 1970 to 1993 at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wood Research in Braunschweig, where he was engaged in technological wood research, cooperating also with the-then director, Dr. Rainer Marutzky. His work focus soon became various particleboard materials and their production using synthetic resins, mostly formaldehyde-based resins (UF, MUF, PF). Regarding this topic, Roffael authored his habilitation thesis, titled \"Possibilities of gluing wood particles with phenol-formaldehyde resins and sulfite liquor,\" which resulted in his habilitation at the Faculty of Forestry at the Georg-August University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1976 and granted him the teaching qualification (venia legendi) for the subject of \"Wood Chemistry.\"\nBeginning in 1981, Roffael taught as an adjunct professor at the Faculty of Forestry at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1993, he accepted the appointment to the Chair of Wood Science at Goettingen University. In the following years, he established the Wood Chemistry Department at the Institute of Forest Utilization, and in 1997, the entire institution was renamed to as \"Institute of Wood Biology and Wood Technology\".\nRoffael gained international recognition primarily through his contributions to formaldehyde research. He had focused his scientific attention on this issue publishing the seminal work \"Die Formaldehyd-Abgabe von Spanplatten und anderen Werkstoffen\" in 1982. However, it was only in the years following that the topic garnered widespread public attention, especially due to serious concerns about the potential health risks and the hazards for the public health. That work was updated and translated into Russian (1991) and English (1993). The methods and devices for measuring the then-found carcinogenic formaldehyde emissions from materials, which Roffael co-developed, were the basis for the development of the German (DIN) and European (EN) standards, guidelines, and regulations. Roffael continuously sought ways to minimize the off-gassing of these substances. He also conducted research on other so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from raw wood and glued wood products. Roffael was also heavily involved in the development of tannin-bonded particleboard panels.\nHe held numerous patents. In addition, more than 20 doctoral theses and more than 40 D.Sc. and M.Sc. theses were performed under his scientific guidance. Roffael was very active in numerous committees and associations, served for the former German Society for Wood Research (DGfH e.V.) in several expert committees. In addition, he was regular member of the Euro Wood Network, the United Nations Environment Programme Working Group, the Zellcheming Association and the Cellulose-Chemists-Club Darmstadt. He also participated as a member in the editorial boards of the estemmed wood-related journals, Holzforschung and European Journal of Wood and Wood Products.\nEven after his retirement in 2005, he continued to be active in scientific research at Goettingen University, coordinating various research projects. In 2017, he published the book \"Formaldehyde in Nature, Wood and Wood Materials\", both in German and English.\nEdmone Roffael died in Braunschweig in January 2021.\nRecognition\nDuring his career, Roffael published his research findings primarily in journals such as WKI-Mitteilungen, Holz als Roh- und Werkstoff, Holz-Zentralblatt, and Das Papier. By 2019, he had authored over 900 scientific and technical publications of any kind.\nHis research work enjoyed a worldwide recognition. His various research and consulting activities took him to Egypt, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Greece, Canada, Malaysia, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, and the USA.\nIn 1988, Roffael, along with his fellows Marutzky and Mehlhorn, were awarded by the International Association iVTH for their research work on the topic \"Investigations on the formaldehyde emissio",

    "Constituency in Seoul, South Korea\nDobong A (Korean:\u00a0\ub3c4\ubd09\uad6c \uac11) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Dobong District, Seoul. As of 2024, 136,836 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Dobong constituency.\nHistory\nSince its establishment, Dobong A has more often voted for centre-left, liberal parties to represent the constituency and is thus considered a stronghold for the Democratic Party.\nShin Oh-chul of the right-wing New Democratic Republican Party was the first member to represent the constituency, having won with only 33.27% of the vote. Shin unsuccessfully ran for re-election and was succeeded Yoo Ihn-tae of the centre-left Democratic Party. In the following election held in 1996, Kim Geun-tae of the centrist liberal National Congress for New Politics won the seat with 38.85% of the vote, narrowly beating out Yang Kyung-ja of the centre-right Grand National Party. Kim won re-election in 2000 and 2004 and went on to serve as Minister of Health and Welfare under President Roh Moo-hyun. Kim narrowly lost re-election in 2008 to Shin Ji-ho of the Grand National Party. Shin was not re-nominated for the 2012 election, after losing to Yoo Kyung-hee in the Saenuri Party's primary for the constituency. In the general election, Yoo Kyung-hee faced In Jae-keun, the spouse of former representative Kim Geun-tae who had passed away in 2011. In Jae-keun emerged victorious, securing 58.46% of the vote. In won re-election in 2016 and 2020, garnering 60.1% and 54.2% of the vote respectively.\nAhead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, incumbent In Jae-keun announced that she would not be standing for re-election in Dobong A. On February 23, 2024, the Democratic Party nominated former YTN anchor Ahn Gwi-ryeong as the party's candidate for Dobong A. Despite the constituency's historical preference for candidates from the Democratic Party and predecessor parties, Ahn narrowly lost to Kim Jae-sub of the conservative People Power Party. Kim Jae-sub was one of only three People Power Party candidates to win in Seoul constituencies north of the Han River.\nBoundaries\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Ssangmun 1-dong, Ssangmun 3-dong, and Chang-dong. It is bordered by Dobong B to the north, Gangbuk A to the south and west, Nowon A to the east, and Nowon B to the northeast.\nList of members of the National Assembly\nElection results\n2024\n2020\n2016\n2012\n2008\n2004\n2000\n1996\n1992\n1988\nSee also\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n",

    "Japanese racehorse\nMaruzensky (Japanese: \u30de\u30eb\u30bc\u30f3\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc; May 19, 1974 - August 21, 1997) was an undefeated Japanese thoroughbred racehorse.\nHis racing career was extremely successful, winning all of the races he entered, including the Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes which he had won with a massive gap, earning the nickname \"Supercar\" in the process. However, as horses brought over from abroad at the time were barred from entering any of the Triple Crown races, the horse was unable to enter in such races.\nAs a stallion, he was also successful, producing Derby winner Sakura Chiyono O, as well as 3 other Grade I winners, among others.\nBackground\nMaruzensky's dam, Shill, by Buckpasser, was bought at the Keeneland Sales in the Autumn of 1973 by Zenkichi Hashimoto, father of future olympist and Diet member Seiko Hashimoto. Hashimoto, while having owned cows in his ranch, was relatively new to the world of owning racehorses, when he was on a business trip from Japan. There, he also met the horse's future trainer, Shigehiko Hongo.\nAt the auction, Hashimoto was told by his interpretor that, given her mare line, as well as the fact the horse was pregnant with a foal of Nijinsky, it was expected that the horse would bid at a high price. Feeling both insulted by the interpretor for his career involving  and a desire to buy Shill for himself, he wound up buying the horse for 30 million US Dollars, which would have amounted to about 90 million Japanese yen at the time.\nAfter being shipped to Japan, Shill foaled a colt on May 19, 1974. Hashimoto planned to give the Maruzen yag\u014d to the horse, and went with \"Maruzensky\" as the foal was a colt, rather than \"Miss Maruzen\" had the foal had been a filly.\nTwo years later, the horse entered Hongo's stable in July 1976.\nRacing career\n1976: Two year old season\nMaruzensky's maiden race was on October 9, with Seiichi Nakanowatari\u00a0 as his jockey. There, the horse handily beat the other horses, finishing the race with more than 2 seconds of gap against the 2nd place. Maruzensky also won his next race, an allowance race, where he finished the race with a 9 length gap between him and the 2nd place.\nThe horse was then entered to the Fuchu Sansai Stakes, an open race, on November 21. The race was contested by only 5 runners, including Hokkaido Sansai Stakes winner Hishi Speed\u00a0, who had almost caught up to Maruzensky in the race due to Nakanowatari not anticipating any other horse to catch up to him, and had let the horse run slowly. Maruzensky and Hishi Speed ran neck and neck, resulting in a photo finish which concluded that Maruzensky beat the latter by a nose.\nOn December 12, the horse was entered in to the Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes. There, the horse took the lead early on, and ran the front of the pack, finishing the race with a 13 length lead. His time, 1:34.4, was a course record that would not be broken for 14 years until Lindo Shaver\u00a0 broke it in 1990. After the race, Nakanowatari commented that \"he couldn't even hear the footsteps of the other horses\" past the 3rd corner. Hishi Speed's jockey, Futoshi Kojima\u00a0, commented \"That thing is a monster... To be honest, I'm glad I won't have to deal with  for a while\" regarding the winner of the race.\nFor his performances, he was awarded the Yushun Sho Saiyushu Sansai Boba that year.\n1977: Three year old season\nMaruzensky started off the season with an open race held at Chukyo Racecourse with the intention of running in the Kisaragi Sho. However, other trainers feared losing to the undefeated horse, and avoided entering the race. The open race was almost canceled were it not for Masatoshi Hattori\u00a0 entering two of his horses under his training. Maruzensky ultimately won the race by a 2 and a half length lead. After this win, however, Maruzensky fractured his shin, and was forced to take a three months long break.\nMaruzensky returned to racing that May, and won another open race with a 7 length lead, but the horse was unable to enter the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby) as horses brought over from abroad, including as fetuses at the time, were barred from running in a Triple Crown race. Nakanowatari reportedly begged to have the horse enter the race, pleading \"Let  enter the Japanese Derby. I don't care if the horse starts from the furthest outside. We won't interfere the other horses. We don't need the prize money. We just want to see how the horse would do\". Hashimoto planned to go to court over this, but ultimately the decision was unchanged. Maruzensky being barred from entering the Derby caused controversy within the horse racing circle of Japan, with the official JRA magazine, Yushun, even holding a discussion panel on its September 1977 issue.\nOn June 26, Maruzensky was entered in to the Nihon Tampa Sho, where nearly 80,000 people attended to see the horse run. Maruzensky faced off the NHK Hai\u00a0 and future Kikka Sho winner Press Toko\u00a0, but by far the most favored to win was Maruzensky, whose parimutuel odds was consistently at 1.0. At the race, Maruzensky",

    "American historian and academic\nEric Zolov is an American historian, author and academic. He is Professor of History at Stony Brook University where he was the Director of Latin American & Caribbean Studies (2016\u201319), and as of 2024 he is Director of Undergraduate Studies as of (2020\u2013present). Previously, he taught at Franklin & Marshall College (1998\u20132011). Zolov is known for his work on the interplay between culture, politics, and international relations in twentieth-century Latin America, particularly during the Cold War era. His first monograph Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture was published in 1999 to positive critical acclaim, and was translated and published in Spanish by Norma Editorial. His book The Last Good Neighbor: Mexico in the Global Sixties (2020, Duke University Press) won the 2021 Mar\u00eda Elena Mart\u00ednez Prize in Mexican History by the Conference on Latin American History (CLAH-AHA). Zolov has been a member of the American Historical Association since 2001.\nBiography\nZolov graduated with a B.A. in history from Colby College in 1987. He studied at the University of Chicago where he graduated with a dual M.A. in International Relations and Latin American Studies in 1990, and a Ph.D. in Latin American History in 1995.\nIn an interview with Perspectives on History, a magazine published by the American Historical Association, Zolov said that he had never been interested in history or good at memorizing places, names or events, and that having Jack D. Foner teach him a social history course in college ignited his interest in the field. He said he was \"hooked by the idea that history offered so much more than knowing \u201cthe right answer.\u201d\"\nIn 2021, Zolov's book The Last Good Neighbor: Mexico in the Global Sixties won the Mar\u00eda Elena Mart\u00ednez Prize in Mexican History as the best published book on the history of Mexico published in 2020.\nIn 2022 Zolov and his wife Terri Gordon-Zolov published The Walls of Santiago: Social Revolution and Political Aesthetics in Contemporary Chile (Berghahn Books, 2022). Zolov and Gordon-Zolov embarked on the project of documenting the Estallido Social in Santiago through photographs, interviews, and research while living in Chile on a Fulbright Fellowship. Initially focusing on graffiti and political graphics, their project expanded to include various forms of public art and performances, culminating in a multi-modal approach including a monograph, an exhibit, an interactive map, and a website. They view their work as a form of scholarship-activism, aiming to translate the significance of the uprising and its artistic expressions to broader audiences, contributing to a larger archival consciousness and historical understanding of the events of 2019\u201320.\nBibliography\nBooks\nZolov, Eric.

    "Species of scorpion\nMesobuthus vesiculatus is a species of scorpion in the family Buthidae. It is primarily located in Iran, ranging from the Caucaso-Iranian Highlands to Anatolian-Iranian Desert (90% of Iran). The males and females are of a modest in size, reaching lengths of 60 mm or approximately 2.4 inches. M. vesiculatus is known to have a yellowish to brownish yellow coloration with brownish segments located at or near tergite, sclerotized plate formed near dorsal portion of an arthropod, and dark reticulations on the basal half. Males in general have more pectines, comb-like teeth, 26-29 than females 20\u201322.\nMorphology\nCarapace\nAnterior of the carapace is virtually smooth, with slight emarginates. The carinae are seen to be more pronounced in males and granular in both genders. However, the posterior median carinae are small with granules on the dorsal edge of the carapace. The dorsal side of the metasomal segments are all temperately developed. Three pairs of lateral eyes are located on each side, and the median eyes are separated, from one another, by 2 ocular diameters.\nTelson\nThe telson is globular in shape, characteristic of the scorpions in the family Buthidae, but appears more swollen with short, small, and hooked aculeus (A. Karatas, 2012).\nChelicerae\nIt has two reduced denticles at base of the ventral side of its movable finger.\nLegs\nAll legs have spurs that are prolateral and retro lateral, and all telotarsi have two rows of bristles ventrally and several setae dorsally. The dactyl is small and blunt, while the ungues short, stout, and weakly curved (A. Karatas, 2012). Legs III and IV contain strong tibial spurs.\nHemi spermatophore\nThese are typical for this genus and family of scorpion. The outer and interior lobe of the truncal flexure are thick at the base. There are four distinct lobes with the interior lobe being the largest in size.\nDifferentiation of M. vesiculatus from other scorpions in family Buthidae\nM. Vesiculatus is similar to Sassanidotus gracillis because they both have a large telson and narrow metasoma but M. Vesiculatus is shown to have three granules near the terminal granule on the pedipalp movable finger. M. Vesiculatus also has very pronounced carapacial and metasomal carination, and its metasomal segment are seen to be larger than that of Olivierus caucasicus and smaller than that of M. eupeus. M. Vesiculatus is different than these three other species in that its median eyes are much larger, its vesicle and aculeus is smaller, and it has a stouter carination on its pedipalp.\n",

    "German politician (1927\u20132003)\nWalter Halbritter (17 November 1927 \u2013 11 April 2003) was a German civil servant, politician and party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as the longtime head of the Office for Prices at the Council of Ministers of the GDR and was a member of the Central Committee of the SED. Additionally, from 1967 to October 1973, he was a candidate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the SED.\nLife and career\nBorn into a family of agricultural workers on 17 November 1927, in Hoym, Halbritter attended primary school from 1934 to 1942 and underwent administrative training from 1942 to 1944. In 1944, he was conscripted into the Wehrmacht and spent time as prisoner of war in British captivity from May to December 1945.\nUpon his return, he worked as a farm laborer and joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) in 1946, and the Free German Youth (FDJ) in 1948. He worked at the Ballenstedt district administration until 1951, afterwards studying at the German Administrative Academy in Forst Zinna, de facto a cadre factory of the SED, from until 1954. He subsequently served as head of the Budget Department of the GDR's Ministry of Finance.\nFrom 1952 to 1957, he pursued distance learning at the Humboldt University and University of Economics in Berlin, earning a degree in economics. Starting from 1954, he worked as a staff member in the Central Committee of the SED, eventually serving as deputy head of its Planning, Finance, and Technical Development Department from 1960 to 1961.\nPolitical career\nMinister\nFrom 1961 to 1963, he was deputy finance minister, then served as deputy chair of the State Planning Commission and chair of the Committee for Labor and Wages until 1965. From December 1965 to November 1989, he was the first and only head of the newly established Office for Prices at the Council of Ministers of the GDR, holding ministerial rank. Additionally, from November 1967 to 1989, he was a member of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.\nHalbritter's office compared consumer prices, for example for basic foods or energy, in the GDR with those in other countries. According to the government's ideas, these were then also established for the internal market. The problem here was the fact that the Price Office, as an intermediate steering body, decoupled the connection between the producers' production costs and the purchasing power of consumers. This led to chaotic conditions, especially in areas where prices had been heavily subsidized and frozen by the state for several decades, for example for food, drinking water, utilities such as electricity and gas, tradesmen's services or fees for public transport, because households did not were more encouraged to consume or consume according to their own possibilities. This resulted in excess demand, which in a market economy would result in a price premium. However, since consumer prices were fixed by the state, this often led to a waste of resources. For example, basic foods were thoughtlessly fed to small animals and the energy provided was used carelessly.\nHalbritter was awarded the Banner of Labor in 1963 and 1969, the Patriotic Order of Merit in 1977 and 1987 (honor clasp), and the Martial Order \u201cFor Services to the People and Fatherland\u201d in 1984.\nSED Central Committee\nFrom April 1967 (VII. Party Congress) until its collective resignation in December 1989, he was a full member of the Central Committee of the SED. He additionally became member of the Volkskammer in 1967. He was also elected to the Politburo of the Central Committee of the SED, the de facto highest leadership body in East Germany, as a candidate member, but was not reelected in October 1973, when Erich Honecker instituted a major reshuffle of the Politburo following Walter Ulbricht's death.\nPeaceful Revolution\nDuring the Wende, from December 1989 to February 1990, he served as Representative of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers for the Central Round Table and for the dissolution of the Office for National Security in the Modrow government, with the rank of state secretary.\nIn this role, he was tasked with preparing talks at the Central Round Table, as well as serving as a liaison to the Office for National Security and the Dissolution Committee of the Ministry for State Security.\nDeath\nHalbritter passed away in 2003 at the age of 75. He was buried in the cemetery in Seelow.\n",

It started operating in 2008 under Ajt\u00f3si D\u00fcrer sor but had to move to \u00dajbuda due to property development of the building.\nHistory\nThe building on Ajt\u00f3si D\u00fcrer sor used to be a Sacr\u00e9 Coeur Girl's School, later functioned as a socialist party school and then was occupied by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lorand University. When the university moved out, an Israeli businessman bought the property in 2007. The building and the practice studios that belonged to it were subsequently rented out to D\u00fcrer Kert since 2008. From 2014, the club had a five-year contract to rent the space, but had to fight to keep their tenant rights every year, as property developers envisioned the space as a living quarters and an office building. It was also suggested at one point that the property would host the Capital Circus of Budapest. In 2018, the building was acquired by Istv\u00e1n Garancsi\u00a0's property development business and D\u00fcrer Kert started looking for another place to rent. During the Covid19 pandemic, the club had to close down and eventually had to leave the premises. The building was torn down to give way to a modern office building and apartment block.\nThe club found a new place to rent in \u00dajbuda in the former techno and house club Rio II, which was leased to them by BudaPart Office and Residential Park. The building was remodeled to fit the vibe and profile of D\u00fcrer Kert and to harmonize with its surroundings, namely the Kelenf\u00f6ld power station nearby. The new venue has two music halls; one can host 950 spectators, the smaller one is fit for 270 people. The main hall has a panorama window to the Danube, while the second floor hosts an exhibition space, a bar and the backstage.

    "Israeli economist, academic, and author\nAssaf Razin is an economist, academic, and author. He is a Schwartz Professor Emeritus at Tel Aviv University and The former Barbara and Steven Friedman Professor of International Economics, Cornell University.\nRazin is known for his works on international and public economics. His written works include contributions to academic journals like the American Economic Review, Journal of Monetary Economics and the Journal of Political Economy, as well as authoring books such as Fiscal Policies and Growth in the World Economy, Population Economics, Israel and the World Economy: Power of Globalization and Globalization, Migration, and Welfare State: Macroeconomic Trifecta.\nMoreover, he is the recipient of 2017 EMET Prize in economics and is a fellow of various professional organizations including Fellow of the Econometric Society.\nEarly life and education\nRazin's parents arrived in Israel in the late 1930s from Bessarabia in Romania (now Moldova and Ukraine) and founded Kibbutz Shamir where Razin's early life unfolded, shaped by its communal ethos and its remote location as a border settlement. A tragic incident during military service led to unexpected opportunities beyond the kibbutz's confines, paving the way for his unconventional transition from an agricultural place to higher education and eventual pursuit of graduate studies at the University of Chicago. Razin completed his undergraduate studies in agricultural economics from Hebrew University in 1963, followed by an M.A in Agricultural Economics in 1966. Later in 1968, he completed his M.A. in Economics from the University of Chicago, followed by a Ph.D. in Economics from the same institution in 1969.\nCareer\nRazin holds extensive academic experience as a visiting professor at various elite Universities in the US, from his permanent base at Tel Aviv University, Israel. From 200 to 2015 he held the position of the Friedman Professor of International Economics at Cornell University. Throughout  his academic career, he has held various visiting appointments at various institutions, including University of Chicago,  Harvard, Stanford, University of Minnesota, London School of Economics, the University of Munich, Yale University, and Princeton University. Since 2008, he is a Schwartz Professor Emeritus at Tel-Aviv University.\nRazin served in the late 1970s as the chief economic adviser to the Israeli government. His academic administrative experience includes an appointment as the Chair of the Department of Economics at Tel Aviv University from 1974 to 1976. Subsequently, he held the position of dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Tel Aviv University from 1981 to 1986, and Deputy Rector in the early 1990s. Throughout his career, Razin has held diverse advisory appointments at institutions such as the World Bank, and International Monetary Fund, Bank of England and the European Central Bank.\nBooks\nIn addition to 150 scientific articles in economic Journals, Razin has authored various books and monographs throughout his career. In 1978, he co-authored the book A Theory of International Trade Under Uncertainty with Elhanan Helpman. The book explored how the basic theories of international trade are extended and revised in the presence of uncertainty and risk-sharing financial institutions. In 1987, he co-authored a book with Jacob A. Frenkel, Fiscal Policies in the World Economy. The book provided an intertemporal -based analysis of fiscal policies and their effects on economic growth in the global context, integrating traditional and modern approaches in open economy macroeconomics and public economics, with a focus on topics such as government spending, budget deficits, international taxation, and economic convergence across countries.\nRazin's books on the Israeli economy, The economy of Modern Israel: Malaise and Promise (1993), and Israel and the World Economy: The Power of Globalization (2018), explore the effects of immigration, building of economic institutions, technological advancement, and controlling inflation generated  the \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d whereby Israel transformed from a low income agricultural economy into a fully advanced economy.\u201d\nIn 1992 he co-authored with Jacob Frenkel and Efraim Sadka, International Economics, which provides analytical theory for the international ramifications of income and value-added taxation. In 1995, he co-authored  with Efraim Sadka, the book Population Economics, wherein they explored the evolution of economic theories (such as Malthusian and Becker theories, on population growth, focusing on microeconomic factors such as fertility decisions, labor supply, and intergenerational transfers, and their implications for economic policy and social issues. In 2001, he authored the book Labor, Capital, and Finance: International Flows. The book integrated disparate elements of economics into a unified framework, focusing on capital, labor, and finance within globalization, caterin",
    "Stellar system in the constellation Leo Minor\nYZ Leonis Minoris, also known as SDSS J0926+3624, is a star system in the constellation Leo Minor. It is an AM Canum Venaticorum-type variable star, a type of binary systems with ultra-short periods (between 5 and 70 minutes). It is also an eclipsing binary. The apparent magnitude of the system is generally 19.3m, varying by about two magnitudes due to periodic eclipses and outbursts. The distance to YZ LMi is of 815\u00a0pc (2,660\u00a0ly).\nCharacteristics\nYZ Leonis Minoris is made up of a white dwarf star and a low-mass donor companion. The white dwarf accretes matter from the companion via a helium-rich accretion disk. The disk around the white dwarf has a size ranging from 18,000 to 90,800 km, which is about 45% of the orbital separation of the components. The temperature of the disk varies from 5,000 K (in the outer parts of the disk) to 23,000 K (in the inner parts of the disk).\nYZ Leonis Minoris is a very compact system. The orbital period of the stars is just 28 minutes, making it the eclipsing binary system with the shortest orbital period. The components are separated at a distance of 0.29 solar radii (200,000\u00a0km), and the surface-to-surface distance is 167,000 km. It is both an AM Canum Venaticorum variable and an eclipsing variable (eclipsing binary). The white dwarf is partially eclipsed by its donor companion.\nThe system has a normal apparent magnitude of 19.33m, which is way lower than the limit for naked -eye vision (6.5m), making it not visible to the naked eye. A recent estimate from Gaia DR3 gives a distance of 815\u00a0pc (2,660\u00a0ly) for YZ Leonis Minoris, which is significantly larger than previous estimates (of 460\u2013470 pc).\nWhite dwarf\nThe primary component of the system is a white dwarf. It has a mass between 0.79 and 0.89\u00a0M\u2609 and a radius of 0.01\u00a0R\u2609 (1.09\u00a0R\ud83d\udf28). The white dwarf's surface gravity is about 200,000 times stronger than Earth's gravity. Its effective temperature is estimated to be at least 17,000\u00a0K, and Sengupta et al. (2011) found three temperatures between 18,000 and 25,000 K. Its luminosity is about 0.009\u20130.035 times the solar luminosity. The white dwarf is accreting mass from the companion at a rate of 10\u201310 solar masses per year, based on evolutionary models.\nLow-mass companion\nThe secondary component of the system is a low-mass companion. It has a mass estimated to be between 0.027 and 0.038\u00a0M\u2609 (28.3 and 39.8\u00a0MJ) and its radius is estimated at 0.043 solar radii (29,900\u00a0km). The mass of the companion makes it semi-degenerate, it would be fully degenerate if its had a mass close to 0.02\u00a0M\u2609. Its temperature is estimated to be at 3,570\u00a0K (3,300\u00a0\u00b0C), with an upper limit of 3,700\u00a0K (3,430\u00a0\u00b0C). The luminosity of the companion is equivalent to 0.00035 times the solar luminosity.\nVariability\nArtist's impression of an eclipsing binary.\nSDSS J0926+2634 is an AM Canum Venaticorum-type variable star, which is a type of cataclysmic variable system that are ultracompact and deficient in hydrogen, with orbital periods of just some minutes. It is also an eclipsing binary, a type of binary stars where the components eclipse each other, causing variation in the apparent brightness. The American Association of Variable Star Observers also mentions YZ Leonis Minoris as a SU Ursae Majoris-type star (dwarf nova). YZ Leonis Minoris was the first system discovered that is both an eclipsing binary and an AM Canum Venaticorum star. As of 2022, more than 8 such systems are known.\nThe system presents eclipses every 28 minutes, which decrease the system's apparent magnitude by 2 magnitudes and last about two minutes, in addition to presenting outbursts that make the system's apparent magnitude increase by two magnitudes. YZ Leonis Minoris' mean apparent magnitude is 19.33m, decreasing to 17.11\u201316.81m during the outbursts. These outbursts happen every 100\u2013200 days and are likely generated by bursts of enhanced mass transfer from donor star to the white dwarf.\nYZ Leonis Minoris is the variable-star designation of the system.\nDiscovery\nYZ Leonis Minoris was discovered in 2005 by Anderson et al. in a search for spectroscopically unsual objects, after an examination of spectra of 280,000 SDSS objects. It was discovered together with three other objects: SDSS J0129+3842, SDSS J1411+4812, and SDSS J1552+3201.\nSee also\nCataclysmic variable star\nLeo Minor\nAM Canum Venaticorum\nAM Canum Venaticorum star\nVariable star\nNotes\n^ During the outbursts, the apparent magnitude increases to 17.11\u201316.82.\n^ The apparent magnitude of the system decreases in about two magnitudes due to eclipses.\n^ a b c From R = sqrt((((5772)/(T)))^(4)*L), where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature and L is the luminosity.

    "1949 battle of the Karen conflict\nThe Battle of Insein was a 1949 battle during the Karen conflict  where the Karen National Defence Organisation briefly captured the town of Insein, 9 miles from Rangoon. After 111 days of intense fighting, the KNDO failed their goal of capturing Rangoon, and retreated into the countryside.\nPrelude\nSee also: Karen conflict\nDuring the leadup to Burma's independence from Britain, Karen groups were unwillingly to be in a Bamar-dominated country but faced internal divides over the territory of a Karen state and the extent to which they should respect Bamar demands. With this context, the KNU headquarters ordered the establishment of Karen defence militias, known as Karen National Defence Organisations, on 17 July 1947. In October 1947, the dominant political party of Burma- the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), asked the KNU to create a Karen state within Burma, but the KNU refused, demanding more territory.\nFollowing independence, intercommunal violence grew in the Irrawaddy Delta. This violence was blamed on the KNDO by official government accounts, but such incidents were likely carried out by other Karen militias.  Prime minister U Nu and Karen leader Saw Ba U Gyi attempted to de-escalate by touring the delta. To build newfound trust, U Nu allowed the KNDO to recapture Twante near Yangon from the Communist Party of Burma. The KNDO successfully took the Twante canal back but Bamar news organisations were badly informed about this operation, leading to many in Yangon to panic about an impending Karen insurrection.\nOn 1 September 1948, joint KNDO and ethnic Karen military police seized control of Thaton and Mawlamyine. This first move was poorly coordinated and would eventually spark the Karen conflict. Just four days later, the KNDO allowed central government forces to land in Mawlamyine before handing the city back. While the government had doubted the intentions of the KNU, this occupation increased their fears. Conflict increased as a series of retaliatory incidents and massacres escalated following a Bamar militia killing 200 Karens during a Christmas Eve service in a Palaw church.\nBattle\nOn 31 January 1949, the KNU formally declared war on the government and the KNDO was outlawed just four days afterwards. U Nu set up Sitwundan militias who began to demand the KNDOs and ethnic Karen military police to surrender their arms before engaging in battle. The Sitwundans surrounded the KNU headquarters in Insein where local KNDOs had raided the armoury earlier. Nearby KNDOs were called in to defend the quarters with the garrison reaching over 400 members. The KNDO successfully infiltrated Mingaladon airport four miles from Insein, but chose only to capture ammunition. Indian diplomats negotiated a ceasefire between the KNDO and the Burmese military in early February, but it only lasted for three days. The central government attacked Insein with battleships from the Hlaing River. During this time, certain portions of the countryside were under KNDO control, including Hinthada District in northern Ayeyarwady Region. KNDO forces also captured Mandalay, Pyin Oo Lwin,  Meiktila, Toungoo, and Mawlamyine.  The KNDOs in the delta attacked Pyu and Pathein as a distractionary attempt but ultimately failed to do anything but escalate tensions further.\nWith aid from ethnic Chin, Karenni, Shan, Gurkha, and even Communist fighters, the  Battle of Insein eventually ended in the Burmese government's favour. As KNDO positions north of Yangon fell day by day, KNDOs quietly retreated across the Hlaing River and escaped into the countryside. \nAftermath\nShortly after the battle, the Burmese Army's commander-in-chief, Smith Dun (an ethnic Karen), resigned.  The Burmese Army initially being on the verge of total defeat also led to hardline militarists demanding Ne Win to start a coup d'\u00e9tat, which he eventually did in 1962\n",

The title of his thesis was La Legislation du Travail Industriel en Turquie (French: Industrial Labor Legislation in T\u00fcrkiye). Talas reported later that Anthony Babel and Edgard Milhaud, his professors at the University of Geneva, affected his selection of this topic.\nCareer and activities\nTalas worked at the Ministry of Finance and then at the Ministry of Labor where he worked as research council rapporteur until 1953 when he joined the Faculty of Political Science at Ankara University. The same year he was promoted to associated professor and to full professor in 1958. He first taught social economics course at the Faculty.\nTalas was named as the minister of labor to the first cabinet of President Cemal G\u00fcrsel announced on 28 May 1960. The cabinet was formed immediately after the military coup of 27 May 1960 which ended the rule of Democrat Party. Talas was reappointed to the same post in 1961 to the second cabinet of Cemal G\u00fcrsel. Talas held the post for one year and returned to his teaching post at Ankara University. During his ministerial post Talas signed the European Social Charter on behalf of Turkey. He also played a significant role in the inclusion of the right to strike in the new Constitution of Turkey.\nTalas served as the dean of the Faculty of Political Science for two terms: from 1960 to 1961 and from 1970 to 1971. Following the 1971 memorandum he was arrested and imprisoned for a while along with other leading academics from Ankara University, including M\u00fcmtaz Soysal and Bahri Savc\u0131. Talas retired from  university in 1983.\nTalas was a member of the Republican People's Party. He was also involved in the formation of the Social Democracy Party in 1983 after his retirement. He was member of various associations and foundations, including Turkish Human Rights Association, Turkish Cooperative Association, Turkish Economic Association, Atat\u00fcrkist Thought Association and History Foundation.\nWork and views\nTalas published many books and articles in Turkish and in French. He was among the contributors of the Forum magazine.\nFor Talas the goal of the 1960 coup was to reestablish social justice in order to transform the Turkish society. He was one of the supporters of the right to strike in Turkey and published many articles on this issue in various newspapers. He argued that increasing worker wages has positive effects on industrial development. He also regarded the collaboration between employers and employees as one of the prerequisites of the economic development.\nDeath\nTalas died of heart failure at his home in Ankara on 14 October 2006. After the ceremony at the Faculty of Political Sciences and funeral prayers in the Kocatepe Mosque he was buried in the Kar\u015f\u0131yaka Cemetery on 17 October.\nLegacy\nAn annual prize in social politics was inaugurated by the Faculty of Political Science at Ankara University in 2012 in memory of Cahit Talas.\n",

    "\nWoman with a Blue Pencil is a 2015 metafictional mystery novel by Gordon McAlpine. It was first published by Prometheus Books, via their Seventh Street imprint.\nSynopsis\nOn December 6, 1941, Sam Sumida is a Japanese-American academic in Los Angeles, whose quest to find the murderer of his wife is disrupted when he finds himself six weeks in the future, in a world where no one remembers he ever existed... because, in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the novel whose protagonist he was has been rewritten.\nElsewhere, Maxine Wakefield is an editor of mystery novels, writing letters to Takumi Sato \u2014 one of her authors, who is now in a Japanese internment camp \u2014 in which she explains that American readers will no longer accept the notion of a Japanese hero pursuing a white criminal, and coaxes Sato into rewriting his novel so that it is about Jimmy Park, a Korean-American private detective hunting Japanese spies.\nReception\nThe novel was a finalist for the 2016 Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Paperback Original.\nIn a starred review, Publishers Weekly praised McAlpine for his \"masterly critique\" of the mystery genre, and emphasized that the novel \"works both as a conventional mystery story and as a deconstruction of the genre's ideology\", such that regardless of whether readers follow Sam or Jimmy, \"the parallel stories pack a brutal punch.\" The Historical Novel Society called it \"superb\" and \"highly recommended\".\nPaste noted that the excerpts from The Revised  and The Orchid and the Secret Agent  show that both are \"fast-paced, rip-roaring reads\", and lauded McAlpine for the \"sequencing of excerpts and letters\", such that when \"an excerpt from The Orchid and the Secret Agent (...) contains a particularly heavy-handed bit of patriotic grandstanding or xenophobic bile, or a dropped-in detail that seems ridiculously out of place,\" it is followed immediately by \"the missive from the editor that mandated its inclusion.\"\nThe Los Angeles Review of Books found it to be a \"thrill to read\", and an \"ingeniously structured metafictional noir of surprising depth\" which \"critiqu the art and artifice of writing, editing, and publishing\", and observed that the three narratives affect each other, with \"the Orchid\" (the \"dragon lady caricature\" who commands the \"network of Japanese assassins\" that Jimmy must infiltrate) being recognizably based on Sam's murdered wife, and Sam's former home being filled with photos of Jimmy.\n",
    "Women's basketball championship game\nThe 1988 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship game was the final game of the 1988 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. It determined the champion of the 1987\u201388 NCAA Division I women's basketball season and was contested by the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters and the Auburn Tigers. The game was played on April 3, 1988, at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington. After trailing 31\u201317 at halftime, No. 5 Louisiana Tech stormed back to defeat No. 3 Auburn 56\u201354 to capture the program's second NCAA national championship.

    "\nThe Forces of Change (Arabic: \u0642\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u063a\u064a\u064a\u0631) is a parliamentary bloc in the Lebanese parliament which comprises multiple reformist parties and independents. It originally consisted of 13 MPs following the 2022 Lebanese general election.\nBackground\nMany reformist groups emerged during the 2018 Lebanese general elections standing against the 9-year ruling and mostly repeat deputies in parliament and sought for change. Most notable of the group was the Kuluna Watani alliance. The alliance gathered with a new Political Party (\"Sabaa\") and 10 different campaigns and groups, most of which are connected to campaigns started in the protest movements of 2015 or the municipal elections of 2016. The alliance included in addition to Sabaa which is a nationwide secular Political Party few local political groups, namely Libaladi in Beirut 1 and Lihaqqi in Mount Lebanon 4. Speaking at an inauguration event, Charbel Nahas, whose party Citizens within a State joined the Koullouna Watani lists at a later stage, said the purpose of the lists was to provide an alternative to the \"corrupted\" power in Lebanese politics. The Shiite Taharror movement was also established in the wake of the protests.\n2022 elections\nDuring the 2022 Lebanese general elections, many activists and previous organizations expressed intent to run with goals of replacing the political class and reforming the country. These organizations include, Citizens in a State which ran under the Qadreen lists, Shamaluna which ran in the North III district and the Mada network which was made out of multiple smaller reform groups. Many older and tradition parties joined October 17 lists such as the historic National Bloc Party and the Lebanese Communist Party and other larger parties claimed to be members of the movement like the Kataeb party, the Independence Movement and the Popular Nasserist Organization (PNO).\nIn total, these candidates received 237,667 votes (13.14%) and won 13 seats which formed a new reformist bloc in the Lebanese parliament.\nDeputies\nActivities\nAlong with many others, it was in nature for October 17 MPs to opt out on voting for long-time speaker Nabih Berri. For the deputy speaker the MPs voted for newly elected MP Ghassan Skaff however he still lost to long-time politician Elias Bou Saab.\nThe 2 secretaries of parliament were elected immediately after the Deputy Speaker. Although not constitutionally required, it was decided that the secretaries would be attributed to one Maronite Christian and one Druze. The election process of the 2 deputies had large debate particularly by opposition MPs. It was suggested that each MP votes for both preferences in the same ballot and that the positions should not be based on religion. However, it was decided that voting would take place on the basis of one name per ballot. As a result of this Firas Hamdan, an opposition MP, who was one of few candidates for the Druze secretary, withdrew his candidacy in protest of the sectarian electoral procedure.\nDisputes and withdrawals\nThe newly formed bloc continuously faced disagreements with each other, like voting on the premiership and the presidency, failure to create common grounds with other parliamentary blocs and failing to unite with the parliament opposition. This led to the withdrawal of 2 MPs from the bloc, Michel Doueihy of Osos Lebanon and Waddah Sadek of Khatt Ahmar, both citing political tensions.\nSee also\n17 October Revolution\n",
    "\nThe Battle of Esc-Sc\u00e8bb, also known as the Battle of the Esc-Sc\u00e8bb wells, was fought on 8 December 1913 in the fields north of Esc-Scebb, between the departments of the Regio Esercito, commanded by lieutenant Antonio Giuseppe Miani\u00a0 and the Libyan guerrillas of Mohammed ben Abdallah. The battle can be classified as part of the First phase of the Italian colonization of Libya.\nBackground\nIn August 1913, a military expedition composed of 1,100 men (only 108 nationals, and the rest colonial), 4 70/15 Mod. 1902 mountain guns, 4 Vickers machine guns, 4 light trucks and 1,765 camels, commanded by Lieutenant Antonio Giuseppe Miani\u00a0, left Sirte heading towards Socna. This location, defined as \"The gate of Fezzan\", was decided as a support base for the Italian penetration into the desert region of Fezzan, which until then had remained under Ottoman control until October 1912, and then in the hands of the Libyan guerrillas by 1913. Miani, promoted to lieutenant colonel of the General Staff, was chosen, at the end of April 1913, by the then Minister of the Colonies, the Honorable Bertolini, to lead a military expedition into the Libyan hinterland. The occupation of Fezzan was initially planned and studied by the previous Governor of the Colony, Lieutenant General Ragni and then by his successor, General Garioni and considered of primary importance to consolidate the Italian occupation of the Fourth Shore. After a brief stop in Socna, the expedition left in the first days of December and crossed the Gebel el-Soda entering Fezzan.\nBattle\nOn 8 December 1913, around 2 PM, the vanguard of the Miani expedition spotted a large quantity of camels from afar, around 60, escorted by around 600 armed men. The men under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Miani, who had just set foot in Fezzan with the task of occupying it, until that moment unopposed, are preparing for their first clash against Mohammed Ben Abdallah's fighters. The enemy column was moving to carry out an outflanking maneuver aimed at hitting the rear and flank of the Italian formation.\nThe column continued to move in the same direction, but Captain Streva's Libyan group broke away from it and had to divert its march, head north and stop the advance of the enemy frontally, assisted by the artillery fire of the Mondini battery. In the meantime, the 1st and 2nd Eritrean companies, under the command of Major Suarez and positioned on the left flank of the column, began an outflanking movement to the south which with a rapid turn towards the west would have denied any enemy attempt to reach the oasis of Esc Scebb. Supporting the advance of the Eritreans was the Locurcio battery, located 400 meters away with the Mondini battery. Around 2:30 PM the clash began, the guerrillas taken by surprise stopped their march and sought shelter to return fire. The artillery did not stand by and watched, they placed the pieces in ten minutes and at 2:55 PM they opened fire on the Libyan guerrillas, firing a total of 72 shots in a short time. Supported by the artillery, the Eritrean companies advanced in large leaps towards the enemy, managing to disperse the caravan. De Dominicis and his men also managed to capture the head of Bel Gasim el Beddi, commander of the battle on the side of the Libyan militants, who died shortly afterwards. The second in command, Omar Abd el Nebi, also lost his life with him. The guerrillas lost about a hundred men, including about eighty near the wells during the battle and the rest in the ruinous retreat after it. The Italians left only three dead and six wounded on the field, including Captain Giorgetti who was wounded in the right leg.\nNotes\n^ The \"Fourth Shore\", (in Italian: Quarta Sponda) was the name given to the coastal region of Libya at the time of the colonization by the Italians.\n",
    "Botanical collector (fl. 1777\u20131782)\nRoger Shakespear also written as Roger Shakespeare (flourished 1777\u20131782) was a botanical collector. He is known to have collected specimens in South America, North America and Jamaica for Sir Joseph Banks (1743\u20131820) and Dr John Fothergill (1712\u20131780).\nRoger Shakespear may also be the \"Mr. Shakespear\" recorded as collecting fish from Jamaica and sending them to the British Museum, where they were catalogued by Daniel Solander (1733\u20131782) in the 1760s. Some of these fish were then sent to the Faculty of Medicine at Montpellier by Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet (1761\u20131807), then to the Musee d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris by 1828, where they were studied by Georges Cuvier (1769\u20131832) and Achille Valenciennes (1794\u20131865).\npreserved specimen of Trema micranthum a.k.a. Jamaican nettletree, collected by Roger Shakespear in the West Indies (BM013717923)\nRoger Shakespear contacted John Fothergill circa July 1777, seeking a plant-collecting assignment but needing \u00a3100 to fund it. Fothergill had high estimation of Shakespear's talent: \"he will be able to collect specimens in perfection - and to send us the seed.\" Fothergill petitioned several friends, alongside himself, to each contribute a \u00a320 stake to Shakespear's trip: James Lee (Scottish nurseryman and botanist, 1715\u20131795), William Malcolm (a London nurseryman, d. 1798), Dr William Pitcairn (botanist and physician at St Bartholomew's Hospital, 1712\u20131791) and Joseph Banks. .\nShakespear can be placed in Jamaica in the year 1777 thanks to dated specimens he collected, e.g. Columnea hirsuta and Marcgravia brownei and the ferns Osmunda regalis  and Hymenophyllum sericeum.\nOn 2 April 1779 Matthew Wallen of Jamaica wrote to Joseph Banks to say he had some plants ready for Shakespear, and was going to arrange Shakespear a passage to the Bay of Honduras.\nDru Drury's illustration of Lestes caerulatus  (top), described from a specimen collected by Mr Shakespear at the Bay of Honduras\nPerhaps relating to Shakespear's intention to travel to the Bay of Honduras in 1779, the entomologist Dru Drury (1725\u20131803) owned and described a specimen of a giant damselfly from the Bay of Honduras, number 79 in his cabinet, which he had labelled with its collector's name: \"Libellula caerulata, Muskito Shore. Mr Shakespear, 1779.\" First described by Drury as Lestes caerulatus, this damselfly species is now known as Megaloprepus caerulatus (Drury, 1782).\nRoger Shakespear is recorded as having collected the plants \"purple spider-wort\"  and \"yellow flower-fence\" Guilandina moringa in Honduras in 1782, which were planted in the garden of Hinton East (d. 1792) at Liguanea, Jamaica. Hinton East was Receiver General of Jamaica and his botanical collections were later transferred to the Hope Estate, part of which eventually became the Hope Botanical Gardens.\nLegacy\nBotanical specimens collected by Roger Shakespear are held in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London, National Museums Liverpool, and the Linnean Society of London, where they are part of the herbarium collection which once belonged to James Edward Smith (1759\u20131828).\nNote\nRoger Shakespear, contemporary Naval Captain\nA Captain Roger Shakespear of the Royal Navy appears in the historical record as active in the West Indies contemporaneously with Roger Shakespear the botanical collector. Captain Roger Shakespear was Regulating Captain for Kingston and the Windward Parishes, and was advertising to recruit men for an expedition by King's Proclamation in November 1779.  Regulating Captains were employed to examine men impressed by press gangs, and were often elderly or had no prospect of going to sea themselves. However Roger Shakespear of the Jamaica Volunteers was an active participant in the San Juan Expedition, making contact with the St Blas Indians to seek assistance, and was later listed as having drowned on 7 April 1780. Roger Shakespear the botanical collector appears to have been alive and active until at least 1782.\n",
    "Nonprofit organization based in New York City\nBrooklyn Queens Land Trust (BQLT) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation, preservation, and creation of community gardens in Brooklyn and Queens, New York.\nOrganization history\nIn the winter of 1998, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani announced that 114 community gardens would be auctioned off in May 1999, claiming that the city would benefit from the land sale and the additional housing to be built on the real estate. After months of public protests and a lawsuit headed by a group of gardeners and State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the auction was stopped and a deal was negotiated for the Trust for Public Land (TPL) and the New York Restoration Project to purchase 112 of the gardens.\nOn March 21, 2004, the Brooklyn Queens Land Trust was chartered and incorporated as a 501(c)(3) organization to manage 34 gardens, 29 in Brooklyn and 5 in Queens, with a plan to own those gardens. The Manhattan Land Trust and the Bronx Land Trust were chartered at the same time. Demetrice Mills was the first president of the organization, and in 2012, the TPL signed over the deeds of 32 gardens to the Brooklyn Queens Land Trust.\nIn 2016, the Trust collaborated with the Brooklyn Public Library on an oral history project featuring several garden founders.\nOrganizational structure\nThe Trust comprises a 15-member Board of Directors and has over 600 volunteer gardeners. They operate through a grassroots structure, with each Member Garden being operated by a group of gardeners, who elect one to two representatives who act on behalf of their garden, either by voting at meetings or serving on the board of directors.\nConservation work\nThe Brooklyn Queens Land Trust maintains its gardens in physical and legal ways, including providing liability insurance, managing property paperwork, connecting gardens to the city water system, and making physical repairs to gardens.\nIn 2016, the Trust received funding from the New York Community Trust to implement the Neighborhood Coalitions Project, which promoted sustainable growing practices and healthy eating through community development events. That same year, they also began the CIRCLE Initiative, with funding from the Land Trust Alliance, which conducted tree inventories and soil testing and implemented composting, rain harvesting, and beekeeping projects.\n",
    "The politics of the United Kingdom in the 19th century describes the parliamentary-cabinet system of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, shaped in the 19th century by constitutional conventions.\nThe United Kingdom is a parliamentary monarchy. In this country, there is no conventionally understood written constitution to this day, in other words: a formal constitution, as is the case in other countries. Instead of one document, there are a number of norms called constitutional conventions, or the constitution in a material sense. The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty applies. The highest rank is held by statutes, which determine, among other things, the role of local government in society. In reality, the British government has freedom in shaping the structure and functioning of public administration bodies. The structure of local government was initiated by a series of statutes in the 19th century.\nPolitical reforms\nSources of constitutional law\nThe United Kingdom does not have a written constitution to this day. In the 19th century, sources of constitutional law in the United Kingdom included:\nPositive law, comprising fundamental legal acts such as the Magna Carta (1215), the Triennial Act (1641), the Habeas Corpus Act (1679), the Bill of Rights (1689), and the Act of Settlement (1701);\nCase law, concerning judicial decisions and covering the most important issues of constitutional law;\nConstitutional conventions, also known as unwritten law norms, which emerged as a result of the actions of non-judicial institutions in matters of the state's organization;\nLegal works, treaties, and legal textbooks.\nLegislative acts\nCharles Grey\nThe first law introducing significant political changes in the United Kingdom was the Reform Act passed on 4 June 1832, which aimed to expand political power to new social classes and establish new electoral districts (the reforms of Charles Grey). It introduced democratic and elective municipal councils; the second one, the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, reorganized the administration of poor relief. Rural parishes transferred care for the poorest to the supervision of newly created workhouses, which alongside the police became the most important local government function at that time. Another law, the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, reformed municipal self-governance, stipulating that authority in individual regions should belong to elected councils. This act allowed only men who paid municipal taxes for the benefit of the poor to vote for the new authorities.\nBetween 1867 and 1885, the extension of voting rights for men was introduced, laying the groundwork for mass political democracy in the UK. Among other laws, the Ballot Act (1872), the Corrupt Practices Act (1883), and the Redistribution Act (1885) were issued. Until 1894, several significant laws were introduced aimed at democratizing elections to local councils. This allowed for membership by election rather than the purchase of mandates. In 1894, the Local Government Act was passed, which divided counties into urban and rural districts. Subsequently, additional acts were enacted to streamline the functioning of local government bodies.\nThe United Kingdom evolved into a parliamentary monarchy with a parliamentary-cabinet system, often referred to as the mother of the parliamentary-cabinet system.\nFrom Charles Grey's reforms to William Gladstone's\nMain articles: Whig government, 1830\u20131834; Third Derby\u2013Disraeli ministry; and Second Gladstone ministry\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone\nThe electoral system existing since 1832 was undemocratic, even though the reform led to the participation and political activity of the middle class in the country. The House of Commons consisted of two deputies from each county, elected through high property census-based elections. The second group in the House of Commons was composed of representatives of towns. Before the reform, the House had 658 members, with 122 representing counties, 432 representing urban districts, and the remaining four representing universities: Oxford and Cambridge. In response to pressure from social groups and the labor movement in the 19th century, electoral reforms were undertaken, leading to the introduction of universal suffrage and the democratization of the House of Commons.\nThe reforms by Charles Grey in 1832 took representation away from small, rotten boroughs with up to 300,000 inhabitants and granted it to other larger towns. As a result, 56 electoral districts were abolished, leaving one mandate in 20 of them. The 143 obtained mandates were distributed among counties and towns.\nThe reform considered newly emerging industrial districts, which previously had no representation in parliament. It provided for 65 mandates for them. The same number of seats was also given to rural districts, whose representatives were intended to counterbalance the bourgeoisie. Additionally, the property census was lowered in counties and towns. Since 1832, 20% of",

    "American lawyer and politician\n William Meade Fletcher (October 21, 1870 \u2013 December 19, 1943) was an American lawyer, professor and Virginia judge, perhaps best known as the author of Fletcher's Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations which continues to be revised decades after his death. Affiliated with the Byrd Organization, Fletcher served as member of the Virginia Corporation Commission (1928\u20131943).\nEarly life and education\nBorn in 1855 near Sperryville, Rappahannock County, Virginia to the former Catherine Meade and her farmer husband James William Fletcher (1827-1900), he was descended from the First Families of Virginia. He had a younger brother, James Hamilton Fletcher (1872\u20131948). In the 1850 census, his father owned 14 slaves, and 39 slaves a decade later.\nAfter the conflict, William M. Fletcher received an elementary education locally, then traveled to Charlottesville where he studied under Professor John B. Minor and received a law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1891.\nCareer\nAdmitted to the bar in 1891, Fletcher first practiced law in Montana (1891\u20131894) before moving to Chicago, Illinois where he practiced mostly corporate law for nearly two decades beginning in 1895. Fletcher also became a professor of law at what was then the John Marshall Law School (1899\u20131901) and then at Northwestern University (1901\u20131904). Between 1905 and 1912, Fletcher taught at law schools in Philadelphia and Chicago, before returning to Rappahannock County and remarrying. \nFletcher wrote several major legal treatises, as seen below, some multi-volume. His first legal publication was about corporate franchises (published by Keefe Davidson Company in 1900), then two years later Fletcher published one on equity pleading and practice, and in 1910 another concerning the incorporation and management of corporations. Although he published another book on equity in 1912, Fletcher's great work was the initially nine volume 'Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations', beginning in 1917. Renamed 'Fletcher's Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations', it remains in print today through Thomson Reuters which acquired West Legal Publishing. Fletcher's co-author or editor was Basil Jones (1874-1939), a fellow University of Virginia graduate and lawyer who became an editor with Callaghan and Company in Chicago and would be buried there at Rosehill Cemetery. Jones's father, C.S.A. Major Horace Jones (1835-1905), had served as Charlottesville's mayor and his widow (Basil's mother) Susan Johnson Duke (1835-1922), regaled her grandchildren in Chicago about prewar Oak Hill plantation in Virginia and chose to be buried there.\nFletcher and fellow Rappahannock County native Wade Hampton Massey Sr. (1869\u20131944) of historic Meadow Grove Farm were close friends as well as political allies of Virginia Governor then U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr. (1887\u20131966), who also traced his lineage to the First Families of Virginia\nIn 1893 Fletcher served as special judge of the Cascade County District Court in Montana. Three decades later, in 1925, Virginia legislators elected him as Judge of the Court of Juvenile and Domestic Relations for Rappahannock County, but he only served for a year. In 1926, Governor Byrd appointed Fletcher to a Commission to Suggest Amendments to the Constitution of Virginia. The following year, Virginia legislators appointed Fletcher as a member of the Virginia Corporation Commission. He took  that judicial and regulatory office on February 1, 1928, and served until his death, with several terms as the rotating chairman. Fletcher also served as a Virginia delegate to the Delaware Democratic National Convention in 1932.\nBy 1914 Fletcher lived at a nearby historic house named 'Erin' while rehabilitating 'Thornton Hill', the family farm in Rappahannock County. Its earliest part had been constructed in 1790 for John Thornton, whose wife was a niece of George Washington (Francis Thornton had patented the acreage in 1720). In 1936 Fletcher cooperated with a historic inventory by the Works Project Administration.\nPublished works\nTaxation of Franchises (1900)\nTreatise on Equity, Pleading and Practice (1902)\nCorporation Forms and Precedents (1913), 2nd Ed. 1928\nTreatise on Incorporation and Management of Corporations in Illinois (1910)\nCyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations (1917-1920)\nSupplement to Corporation Forms and Precedents (1923)\nCyclopedia of the Law of Private Corptoations (1917-1920)\nPersonal life\nFletcher married twice. In 1896 he married Florence Lea of Philadelphia (1868\u20131911), who bore William Meade Fletcher II (1897-1978) who became a lawyer. After her death, Fletcher moved back to Virginia. In 1914 he remarried, to the former Martha Ball Buckner (1888\u20131996), who could trace her descent from Charles Washington, Lawrence Washington's brother and whose daughter had lived at Thornton Hill shortly after its construction.

    "Philosophical critique of Francis Bacon\nAn Examination of the Philosophy of Bacon (French: Examen de la Philosophie de Bacon) is a posthumous work by Savoyard philosopher Joseph de Maistre, analyzing and criticizing the philosophy of Francis Bacon. It was published in 1836 and translated into English by Richard Lebrun in 1998.\nThesis\nMaistre considers Bacon to be the fountainhead of a destructive rationalistic ideology, blaming him for much of the scientism and atheism of the Age of Enlightenment. The argumentation against Bacon's philosophy is based on Maistre's epistemology first enunciated in the St Petersburg Dialogues (1819), according to which science depends on the innate ideas that are common to all human minds. Without such first principles, Maistre argues, experiments would be useless because there would be no basis for judging their validity. Maistre also argues that genius plays a pivotal role in great scientific discoveries, as demonstrated by inspired intellects such as Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, and Isaac Newton, contrary to Bacon's theory about conforming to a mechanistic method.\nReception\nAlthough not as well known as some of Maistre's other works, its importance has long been recognized in France. Augustin Bonnetty remarked that \"it would perhaps be necessary to go back to Pascal's Lettres provinciales to find a more severe, more mocking, more pointed critique.\" Gustave Flaubert quoted a few sentences from the work in his novel Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet (1881)\u2014a critique of bourgeoisie society:\n\u201cBacon est absolument d\u00e9pourvu de l\u2019esprit d\u2019analyse\u00a0; non seulement ne savait pas r\u00e9soudre les questions, mais ne savait pas m\u00eame les poser. // Bacon, absolutely destitute of the spirit of analysis, not only did not know how to resolve questions, but did not even know how to pose them.\u201d\n\u201cBacon, man \u00e9tranger \u00e0 toutes les sciences et dont toutes les id\u00e9es fondamentales \u00e9taient fausses. // Bacon, a man foreign to all sciences and whose fundamental ideas were false to the point of ridiculousness!\u201d\nCharles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, one of the most distinguished literary critics in nineteenth-century France, thought that Maistre's chapters on final causes and on the union of religion and science contained \"certainly some of the finest pages that have ever been written in a human language.\"\nScholars have also claimed that Maistre's work anticipated the philosophy of modern science. According to Frederick Holdsworth, Maistre described for the first time many of the principles on which modern scientific method is based on such matters as the nature of causality, the inevitable human-centeredness of all scientific understanding, the role of intuition in scientific discovery, and the inescapability of metaphysical considerations.

    "1787 opera by Yevstigney Fomin and Nikolay Lvov\nThe Coachmen at the Relay Station (Russian: \u042f\u043c\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0435), also referred to as Coachmen on a stand, or an accidental game, is a 1787 one-act comic opera by Yevstigney Fomin with the libretto authored by N. A. Lvov, and was dedicated to friend of Lvov and folk song collector S. M. Mitrofanov, although it was specifically written on occasion of Catherine the Great's visit to Tambov. Although the scheduled visit never occurred, the opera was completed and performed without Catherine's appearance to resolve the plot as Fomin intended.\nThe work is hallmarked by Fomin's usage of the Russian folk song tradition known as the \"drawn out song\". It was premiered that same year on January 2 (November 8), 1787, although its location of premiere is dubious, performances having taken place in both Tambov and Saint Petersburg that year. The latter is considered to be the official place of premiere, however. On its premiere, however, the work was not popular with the audience and as a result, it fell out of performance.\nMuch of Mikhail Glinka's attempts and artistic recreation of Russian folk music practices originated with Fomin, while the nativist project known as, \"The Five\", specifically Alexander Borodin, continued the focus on authenticity and realism in the ways they attempted to incorporate the choral practices of Russian folk music into their work.\nRoles\nMusical structure\nThe opera itself has 15 scenes but ten musical numbers.\nOverture\nThe folk song  \u201cCaptain\u2019s daughter, don\u2019t go for a walk at midnight\u201d is heard. This corresponds to song No. 16 in Nikolay Lvov and Johann Gottfried Pratsch's 1790 collection of folk songs, Collection of Russian Folk Songs with Their Tunes.\nChorus: \"Not at the priest's in the green garden...\"\nChorus: \"The falcon flies high\"\nAria: \"The zealous heart is valiant...\" (Timofey)\nDuet: \"Between us, coachmen...\" (Yanka and Timofey)\nTrio: \"If only I were a bird...\" (Vakhrush, Yanka, Courier)\nDuet with chorus: \"Should I buy them, Filyushka...\" (Yanka, Timofey, Chorus)\nQuartet with chorus: \"Molodka, regimental soldier...\"\nTrio with chorus: \"In the field the birch was raging...\" (Fadeevna, Timofey, Yanka)\nOrchestral march\nChorus: \"You all give up, give way, good people\"\nRecordings\n1966: \"Russian music of XVII\" (Vladimir Yesipov, Melodiya)\n2006: \"Early Russian opera\" (Bomba Music)\n2020: Nuits Blanches \u2013 Opera Arias at the Court of Russia in the 18th Century (Karina Gauvin and Pacific Baroque Orchestra, ATM Classique)\nSee also\nRussian opera\n",

    "Start of the Brevis historia in the archival copy\nThe Regni Ierosolimitani brevis hystoria ('Short History of the Kingdom of Jerusalem'), called Brevis historia for short, is an anonymous Latin history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from its founding until about 1193 with a short continuation by Jacopo Doria\u00a0 that brings the story down to the kingdom's fall in 1291. At Doria's request, a copy of the work was placed in the Republic of Genoa's archives in 1294. This copy survives, as does a 15th-century copy of it. There is an English translation based on the Latin edition of Luigi Tommaso Belgrano\u00a0.\nThe author of the Brevis historia cites the Annals and the De liberatione civitatum orientis of Caffaro, to which he seems to regard his work as a supplement. Some of his material seems to be derived from William of Tyre and he shares details with the continuation of William known as the Lyon Eracles. Other material is unique and may come from oral sources, such as Genoese travellers to the Holy Land, or from reports or letters sent by Genoese in the Holy Land.\nThe early part of the history, as well as Doria's continuation, is concerned mainly with genealogies and marriages. The reigns of Amalric (1163\u20131174) and Baldwin IV (1174\u20131185) form the central part of the narrative and are more detailed. The original chronicle begins by describing how Godfrey of Bouillon \"was chosen as king and lord\" after the fall of Jerusalem in 1099. It ends by describing how Prince Bohemond III of Antioch inherited the County of Tripoli and passed it onto his son, Bohemond IV, in 1189. Then the continuator declares that \"hat follows was not written in the book, but I, acopo Doria, have briefly reproduced it in written form as I have discovered it from reliable sources.\" He ends his short continuation by noting how the claimants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem \"pointlessly hung on to just the title for the future\". A notary, Guglielmo de Caponibus, then records how the chronicle was placed in the archive in 1294.\nThe author of the Brevis historia is unknow. He may have been one of the Genoese involved in the aftermath of the Battle of Hattin (1187), in the expedition of Conrad of Montferrat or the Third Crusade. He has a high opinion of Count Raymond III of Tripoli and a low opinion of the Templar master Gerard de Ridefort. Alternatively, it has been suggested that he was Oberto Doria, Jacopo's brother.\nNotes\n^ a b c d Hall & Phillips 2013, pp.\u00a041\u201342.\n^ At pp. 151\u2013167 in Hall & Phillips 2013, but also retaining the pagination from Belgrano 1890.\n^ Hall & Phillips 2013, p.\u00a0151.\n^ Hall & Phillips 2013, p.\u00a0166.\n^ Hall & Phillips 2013, p.\u00a0167.\n^ Hall & Phillips 2013, p.\u00a041n, noting that Bellomo 1999 considered and rejected this proposal.\nBibliography\nBellomo, Elena (1999). \"La 'Regni Ierosolimitani brevis hystoria': note circa l'attribuzione e la prospettiva storica di un' 'anonima cronaca genovese'\".

    "The first election to the Carnarvonshire County Council was held on 25 January 1889.  It was followed by the 1892 election. The county was divided into numerous single member wards with two councillors elected to represent some of the urban areas.\nOverview of the result\n1889 was a landmark year in the history of Welsh Liberalism, a coming of age symbolized by the triumph across Wales of Liberal candidates in the inaugural county council elections. The outcome was very similar to that in Cardiganshire.\nUnopposed Returns\nThere were some unopposed returns.\nContested Elections\nThere were a large number of contested elections and the majorities were small in most instances. In most cases there were contests between Liberal and Conservative candidates.\nThe New Council\nThe first meeting of the council was held in Caernarfon.\nSummary of Results\nThis section summarises the detailed results which are noted in the following sections.

It was written by Alejandro, while the production was handled by Mr. Naisgai, Kenobi, and Alejandro. The song was released for digital download and streaming by Sony Music Latin and Duars Entertainment on November 10, 2022, as the third single from the album.

The track reached number one in Dominican Republic. It debuted in the top 15 of the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and was certified gold in Spain. An accompanying music video, released simultaneously with the song, was directed by Stillz. It depicts Alejandro as a worker in another planet. One night, he turns off the energy of the entire city to concentrate it on an intense electric light that illuminates the sky, as if he made contact with an extraterrestrial ship. For further promotion, Alejandro performed the song at the 23rd Annual Latin Grammy Awards.\nBackground and release\nRauw Alejandro released his second studio album, Vice Versa on June 25, 2021.

On November 10, 2022, he revealed the album's track list, mentioning it being set for release the following day. \"Lejos del Cielo\" was included as the fourth track on the track list and was released as the third single from the album, a few hours before the album's release.\nMusic and lyrics\nMusically, \"Lejos del Cielo\" is a Spanish language slow reggaeton song, with elements of electronic music. The song was written by Alejandro, while its production was handled by Mr. Naisgai, Kenobi, and Alejandro himself. The track runs for a total of 3 minutes and 29 seconds. Lyrically, \"Lejos del Cielo\" which translates to \"Far from Heaven\" in English, is an emotional romantic song that portrays the desperation of losing a beloved woman, with lyrics including, \"Me tienes en el aire volando / Pero lejos del cielo / Aunque perderte da miedo / En verdad, mejor dime que no\" (You have me flying in the air / But far from heaven / Although losing you is scary / Really, you better tell me no).\nReception\nLucas Villa from Spin gave \"Lejos del Cielo\" a positive review, calling the song \"lofty\", noting that it \"highlights Alejandro's sexy swagger\". Writing for Los 40, Pascale Quililongo described the track as \"great\".

    "Heathland in Staffordshire, England.\nWetley Moor Common is a Staffordshire Wildlife Trust reserve consisting of ancient common land. It has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to its unimproved lowland heath habitat, which represents approximately 10% of the heathland in Staffordshire. Wetley Moor Common is 118 hectares or 292 acres in size.\nLocation\nWetley Moor Common is located within Staffordshire, England. It shares a boundary with the Northwest edge of the village of Werrington and is positioned between Werrington and Bagnall. The main access point to the Wetley Moor Common is a carpark entrance on Armshead Road, Werrington (ST9 0EL).\nManagement\nWetley Moor Common is jointly owned by the Staffordshire Moorlands District Council and Stoke-on-Trent City Council, however it is managed by the Staffordshire Wildlife Trust. Due to Wetley Moor Commons SSSI status the habitat is monitored and managed. Management of the site includes mechanical scrub control and turf stripping. Gorse plants are also coppiced and heather seeds are scattered to bolster the heather population. Specially trained cattle are also utilized to help graze the habitat.\nThe site is monitored for its effectiveness as a carbon sink. Although in 2023 the habitat was found to be in a degraded state, it was recorded to store nearly 9000 tonnes of carbon which is believed will only improve with effective habitat restoration.\nWildlife and ecology\nThe grounds of Wetley Moor Common cover 118 hectares, however 70 hectares of that consist of unimproved lowland heath habitat. Around two thirds of Wetley Moor Common spans over coal measures and shale. This results in waterlogged peaty soil, which provides the right conditions for a rare wet heath habitat. On the Eastern side of the moor around one third lies on coarse-grained sandstone. This area consists of sandy free draining soil conditions, which provide conditions for dry heath habitat.\nWetley Moor Common contains plant species such as heather, purple moor grass, gorse, soft rush, bilberry and cotton grass. Sphagnum moss is also present on the site, with Wetley Moor Common being a significant carbon sink, despite the habitats degraded state. Wetley Moor Common also provides a suitable habitat for a variety of bird species including: reed bunting, linnet, meadow pipit, whitethroat and grasshopper warblers. Although a majority of the site consists of heathland, there are also areas of improved grassland and degraded marsh habitat.\nHistory\nWetley Moor is an ancient area of common land, which is believed to have previously covered a much larger area. On the 1775 William Yates map Wetley Moor Common is shown to be much larger than it is now, consisting of around 5000 acres and extending to Bucknall, Caverswall, Cheddleton, Dilhorne and Weston Coyney.\n",

    "Australian physician and pathologist (1882\u20131956)\nMary Boyd Burfitt Williams (9 November 1882 \u2013 30 November 1956) was an Australian pathologist and physician. She was the first pathologist at Lewisham Hospital in Sydney and later a physician in Macquarie Street.\nEarly life and education\nMary Boyd Burfitt was born on 9 November 1882, daughter of Annie (n\u00e9e Fitzmaurice) and auctioneer and historian Charles Trimby Burfitt. She was one of seven children, of whom two brothers became doctors and the third a solicitor. She was educated at Rosebank College in Five Dock, matriculating in 1902. She completed a BA and BSc at the University of Sydney, before graduating with first class honours in Bachelor of Medicine in 1909 and a Master of Surgery from the same university in 1910. As part of her degree she studied pathology and, with fellow student Elsie Dalyell, wrote a paper which was presented at a medical conference in Victoria.\nCareer\nWilliams and Dalyell found employment at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) in 1910. She was working as a pathologist at RPAH in 1912, being the first female senior resident there, and at Lewisham Hospital in 1914. Despite some resistance, she was appointed residency status at Crown Street Women's Hospital where she gained experience in obstetrics. She opened a general practice in Glebe in 1912 until 1924 when she moved into rooms in Macquarie Street. She maintained the role of honorary physician at Lewisham Hospital until 1938.\nWilliams was elected president of the University Catholic Women's Society in 1924, a year after it was inaugurated. She was an active member of the movement which led to the establishment of Sancta Sophia College, a residential college for Roman Catholic women at the University of Sydney in 1929. She sat on the Council of the college from its inception through to 1953.\nPersonal\nWilliams married fellow doctor Grosvenor Williams on 19 January 1921 at St James' Church in Glebe. Their three sons also became medical doctors and two were lecturers at the University of Sydney.\nShe died on 30 November 1956 at Bellevue Hill and is buried at Waverley Cemetery.\n",
    "Former castle in Flensburg, Duchy of Schleswig\nDuborg Castle in c.\u20091700. illustration from Jens Trap, 1864\nDuborg Castle (Danish: Duborg Slot, German: Duburg Schloss) sometimes also referred to as Flensborghus (German: Flensburghaus) was a fortification and castle in Flensburg, Schleswig during the Middle Ages and Early modern period.\nEtymology\nThere is uncertainty about the etymology of Dyborg. One theory suggest that it was named after a Danish knight called Jens Due, who lived in the 16th century. Another explenation is that a dove (Danish: due) may have been included in the castle's coat of arms and thereby given its name. In early history of the castle it was named Marienburg after the hill it was erected on, which beared the same name.\nHistory\nThe castle was erected by Margaret I of Denmark and Eric of Pomerania, and would take five years to build, even continuing on parts of the fortifications after Margaret's death in 1412.\nBuilt as protection against the Holsteinians, Duborg would serve an advantageous location in relation to attacks from the west, while the harbor could be defended from the castle. This came evident in 1431 when Adolph VIII of Holstein initiated a siege on the castle, which would last six months. When Christian I of Denmark became Duke of Holstein in 1460 he would inherit the castle, which would continue to be under the Danish kings after the partitions of Schleswig.\nIn the 16th and 17th century Duborg would serve as center of the Danish royal power in Schleswig and would concurrently be a place of residence of Danish monarchs. Frederick III of Denmark would live in the castle during his father, Christian IV's death, and Christian V of Denmark would be born there in 1646.\nIn 1703 the castle would stop being a royal residence and from 1719 it would start being demolished. The demolished bricks would be reused in other places like Flensburghus. The last remnants of the castle would be blown up around 1900.\nSee also\nhaderslevhus\u00a0\u2013 building in Haderslev Municipality, DenmarkPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nkoldinghus\u00a0\u2013 Danish royal castlePages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nDano-Hanseatic War (1426\u20131435)\u00a0\u2013 European armed trade conflict\nFlensburg\u00a0\u2013 town in Schleswig-Holstein, GermanyPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\n",

    "Robert Dean Hatcher Jr. (born October 22, 1940, in Madison, Tennessee) is an American structural geologist, known as one of the world's leading experts on the geology of the southern and central Appalachians.\nBiography\nHatcher attended high school at Springfield, Ohio's Northwestern High School, where he graduated in 1957. At Vanderbilt University, he graduated in 1961 with a B.A. (major in geology and chemistry, minor in mathematics) and in 1962 with a M.S. (major in geology, minor in chemistry). In 1965 he received a Ph.D. in structural geology from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) with thesis supervised by George David Swingle (1922\u20131973). In 1965 Hatcher married Diana Simpson. After about one year as an employee of the Humble Oil and Refining Company (now merged into ExxonMobil), he was appointed an assistant professor at Clemson University. There he was promoted to full professor and taught geology and mineralogy from 1966 to 1979. He and his family in 1978 moved to Tallahassee, Florida, where he was appointed a professor of geology at Florida State University and in 1980 moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where he was a professor until 1988 at the University of South Carolina. In 1986 he returned to Tennessee, where he accepted a joint appointment at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) as Distinguished Scientist and Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences. In 2000 he terminated his position at ORNL but continued as professor at UTK until he retired as professor emeritus in 2018. From 1981 to 1988 Hatcher was the co-editor-in-chief, with William Andrew Thomas (1936\u20132022), of the Geological Society of America Bulletin.\nHatcher has been concerned about geological aspects of nuclear waste disposal and nuclear reactor safety. For disposal of radioactive waste, he served from 1984 to 1986 as science adviser to South Carolina governor Richard Riley. Hatcher served from 1990 to 1996 on the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Board on Radioactive Waste Management and from 1993 to 1996 on a Nuclear Regulatory Commission Federal Advisory Committee on reactor safety.\nResearch\nHatcher's research involves fieldwork more than theory. Most of his research is interdisciplinary, combining wide knowledge from the geosciences. The goal of much of his research is the better understand the evolution of continental crust, by means of studying mountain chains and mature crust. His research on structural geology has focused on \"large faults, mountain chains, formation and breakup of supercontinents, and neotectonics.\" He is the author or co-author of mmore than 200 scientific publications and the co-author or co-editor of several books. Although he has been mostly concerned with the Appalachians, he has several times visited the North American Cordillera in Canada and the US, the Caledonides in the U.K. and Scandinavia, the Alps, Morocco's High Atlas and Meseta, the Tatra Mountains, and the Southern Andes in Argentina. He has also done smaller amounts of fieldwork in China's Qinling (Qin Mountains), the Olkhon region in Siberia, the Mexican Cordillera, and several other regions.\nBeginning in the 1970s, he was a leader in the plate tectonic reassessment of the tectonics of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians using terrane analysis. The reassessment was motivated by the search for oil and gas caused by the oil crisis in the 1970s. With Jack E. Oliver, Sidney Kaufman (1908\u20132008), \nand other colleagues, he used COCORP seismic-reflection profiling to investigate a seismic transversal in the southern Appalachians. They discovered that the Blue Ridge Mountains formed a 200\u00a0km long tectonic blanket similar to that observed in the Alps. His geological map of the Appalachians was published in 1990 and replaced that of Harold Williams. With Harold Williams he wrote the important paper Suspect terranes and accretionary history of the Appalachian orogen published in 1982 in the journal Geology.\nFor many years, Hatcher wanted to do fieldwork related to earthquakes that do not occur on plate boundaries. In 2008 Hatcher was part of a group of geoscientists who received funding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to investigate the paleoseismology of the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone. This seismic zone is the second most active in the eastern USA \u2014 the New Madrid Seismic Zone being the most active. In 2012 he and his colleagues \"found a thrust fault east of Knoxville that displaced bedrock for about one meter over Quaternary river sediment.\"\nHe was instrumental in the planned Appalachian Deep Hole Project (ADCOH), which was proposed for deep drilling through the overthrust of the Blue Ridge Mountains into underlying sedimentary rocks. Although the project was eventually cancelled, preliminary work on the project brought important insights into the tectonics of the Appalachians and was published in a report.\nHatcher has been the leader or co-leader of more than 40 field ",
    "British magazine (2006 - 2021)\nThe Salford Star was a free local news, culture and campaigning magazine based in Salford, Greater Manchester, England. First published in 2006, it moved to online-only publication in 2009, although returned briefly to print in 2015\u20132016. It stopped publishing in 2021 for financial reasons.\nEstablishment\nThe magazine was co-founded in May 2006 by journalists Steven Speed and Stephen Kingston, who had worked together re-launching a small community magazine, the Old Trafford News. Kingston had previously worked freelance for mainstream publications, including the Manchester Evening News, Elle, and The Times. He became frustrated that community articles were rarely accepted by publications, especially when critical of their sponsors; he experienced this particularly when attempting write about potential negative impacts of the 2002 Commonwealth Games on its host city of Manchester. Speed had previously photographed for community media, and was approached by Graham Cooper, a youth worker in a residential regeneration area, to help set up a local paper written by and for Salford people. They decided it would be a not-for-profit publication, and advertised a public meeting at a local pub. The initial meeting was attended by 40 people. The magazine received funding before its launch from UnLtd, Awards for All, and Salford City Council via the East Salford Community Committee.\nFeatures\nThe Salford Star covered local news and culture in Salford. It also featured local history pieces, sports reporting, and ran interviews with celebrities from the area, including Christopher Eccleston, Shaun Ryder, and John Cooper Clarke. The \"What\u2019s On\" section contained previews and reviews of local events and performances. The magazine was vocal on local issues and sometimes took an active role in campaigning.\nCampaigns and investigations\nFrom its inception, it reported critically on local regeneration schemes and published investigations into the property development company Urban Splash, which at the time was responsible for many such schemes in the area. In its first issue it reported on the Lowry Centre, a publicly funded arts venue which had opened six years earlier, promising to ensure it was welcoming to the community. It published a photo comic of an experiment in which a reporter photographed a group of young people as they entered the building, capturing how they were quickly ejected. According to Kingston, Salford City Council said they were \u201cvery angry\u201d about the action, but did meet community contributors to talk about the issues.\nIn August 2009 it campaigned alongside the Tiles and Architectural Ceramics Society (TACS) and local residents to save the The Tree of Knowledge, an Alan Boyson mural at Salford University that was to be demolished, resulting in the work being protected with a grade II listed status.\nRecurring features\nThe Salford Star issued a satirical series of awards called the Mary Burns Awards (named after the local historical figure, Mary Burns). They were \"awarded\" every January to organisations and public figures for \"stupid statements, dodgy dealings and iffy activities\" during the previous year, and often featured critiques related to spending, transparency and unfulfilled promises by local public bodies and their private-sector partners. It also issued genuine awards for music and the arts, voted for by the readership.\nDistribution and participation\n12,000 copies of the first edition were hand-delivered by local volunteers to houses in East Salford, and 3,000 more were left at community and social premises to be given out. Not enough copies of the second edition were available to meet demand, and by the third issue the print run was increased to 20,000. Over 100 volunteers worked for the magazine, including photographers, graphic designers and distributors.\nCommunity projects\nThe Salford Star ran a summer spin-off youth magazines, in which children aged eight to 14 participated in journalistic activities such as holding their own press conferences. These included community relations work with local young people and children of asylum seekers. The magazine also provided training courses in journalism, photography and graphics.\nRecognition\nThe publication was shortlisted for a Paul Foot Award in 2007 and was awarded as a runner-up. It had been longlisted for the same award in 2006 for its investigation into Urban Splash. In 2008 it won the Plain English Campaign's Plain English Award for Best Regional Newspaper and a How-Do award for North West Magazine of the Year.\nClosure\nFacing a lack of funding, the publication campaigned publicly to raise money to keep running. Since its launch, it had been unable to access public funds, with Salford Council revising the criteria for Community Committees' funding of publications. In 2018 it raised \u00a33,000 through various means including an auction of \"Salford relics\". Nigel Pivaro, a regular writer for the Salford Star, auctioned a",
    "Medieval stronghold\nPatmos (Bulgarian: \u041f\u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441) is a medieval fortress in the Rhodope Mountains of southern Bulgaria rising over a promontory near the confluence of the rivers Arda and Borovitsa. A few kilometers to the west upstream the valley of the Arda are located the ruins of the fortress of Krivus.\nLocation\nPatmos is located on a hill over the mouth of the river Borovitsa and left bank of the Arda at the westernmost end of the modern Kardzhali Reservoir. The nearest villages are Borovitsa to the south and Doyrantsi to the north, belonging to the Ardino Municipality of Kardzhali Province. The hill dominates the surrounding lands providing visibility in all directions. Its slopes are vertical from the east and the south and steep from the west. The easiest access is from the north. The fortress is on a state-owned land and was declared a site of national importance is 1968.\nDescription\nRuins of Patmos Fortress\nPatmos consists of a citadel situated in the southernmost part of the hill, a suburb occupying the northern part of the elevation below the citadel, and another suburb on the western area below the hill. The entire complex and the adjacent suburbs span a territory of 100,000\u00a0m2. The citadel of Patmos measures about 115\u00a0m in direction north\u2013south and a maximum width of 65\u00a0m in direction east\u2013west. It has irregular shape, with the defensive walls following the configuration of the terrain, enclosing an area of about 6,300\u00a0m2. The walls enclose the hill from the west and north. It is built of treated stone, joined with white mortar.\nThe more easily accessible north wall is 1.25\u00a0m thick and is reinforced by two towers. The northeast tower is trapezoidal with external dimensions of 5.05x4.22x4.6\u00a0m and wall thickness of 0.85\u00a0m. It was accessible through an entrance with a width of 1.3\u00a0m, which was later walled up. The northwest tower of Patmos is an irregular horseshoe shape. It protrudes in front of the outer side of the wall at a distance of 3.9\u00a0m, and the thickness of its walls is 1.3\u00a0m. There is a square room in its interior, accessed through an entrance. The distance between the two towers is 12.7\u00a0m. After the northwest tower, the walls turn south, forming an arc that runs continuously until reaching the vertical sheer cliffs facing the river Arda to the south.\nWithin the citadel are the ruins of a large, three-nave, three-apsed church without a vestibule and with a length of 13\u00a0m and a width 11.5\u00a0m. It is built of treated stones, joined with white mortar. Its walls are partially located on the rock foundation of the hill and have a thickness of 0.75\u00a0m. The three naves of the church had separate entrances from the west, with a width of 1.35\u00a0m on the central nave and 1.15\u00a0m on the side ones. The floor of the building is the leveled rock foundation, partially covered with stone slabs. It was constructed in the 5th century with subsequent reconstructions in the 9th and the 12\u201314th centuries. The foundation of the church is assumed to the connected with the mission of Nicetas of Remesiana to spread Christianity among the local population.\nNorth of the church are the remains of a rectangular building with a length of 10.8\u00a0m and a width 4\u00a0m, built of rubble stone and joined with white mortar.\nCitations\n^ a b c d e f g h i \"Patmos Fortress\".

    "2017 studio album by Palette-Swap Ninja\nPrincess Leia's Stolen Death Star Plans is a 2017 concept album, combining the music of every song on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band with lyrics describing the plot of Star Wars. It was produced by Dan Amrich and Jude Kelley, under the name \"Palette-Swap Ninja\".\nProduction\nKelley and Amrich first met when they were in a band together in California. Their shared interest in video games led to a friendship which continued even after Kelley moved to Boston in 2007. At this point, they formed Palette-Swap Ninja, a long-distance musical collaboration originally dedicated to parody songs about video games. They soon realized that their most popular songs were those that had a narrative, and decided to make a concept album which would tell a complete story.\nAmrich's original idea was to combine the music from Tommy by The Who, with the plot of the documentary The King of Kong. In 2012, Amrich and his wife Katrin Auch visited Kelley in Boston. While the three were at lunch, Amrich confessed that he could not make the King of Kong/Tommy combination work, at which point Auch said that a successful project of that type would require components that were \"bigger (and) more universally beloved,\"\nlike Star Wars or Sgt. Pepper. By the end of the meal, Amrich and Kelley had devised several of the song titles.\nAmrich spent two years writing the lyrics, after which he and Kelley began the task of replicating the music; this primarily involved software, including Logic Pro, but also used some real instruments, including the same model of electric organ that featured in \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\nAmrich and Kelley originally intended to release the album in December 2015, to coincide with the theatrical release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but felt that it was not ready; they similarly missed the December 2016 release of Rogue One. They finally released the album free online in May 2017, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Star Wars and the 50th anniversary of Sergeant Pepper, which coincidentally were less than a month apart.\nReception\nRolling Stone France commended the album as a \"surprisingly elegant mixture of two masterpieces\". Paste lauded it as \"meticulously planned\" and \"more perfect than it deserves to be.\" Consequence praised Amrich and Kelley for \"having told the film's story in order without futzing too much with each song's cadence and instrumentation.\"\nIo9 felt it was \"most impressive\" and \"really good\", and noted the inclusion of themes from John Williams' Star Wars music. Jason Kottke called it \"amazing\". Slate found its lyrics to be \"clever\", and observed that the music video begins with its own version of the opening crawl.\nLive performance\nIn 2018, Amrich and Kelley \u2014 accompanied by the non-profit Awes\u00f6me Orchestra Collective \u2014  gave a free live performance of the album at the University of California, Berkeley's Hertz Hall.\n",
    "Early Japanese currency\nFor the aircraft carrier, see Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dh\u014d.\nKaiki Sh\u014dh\u014d (\u958b\u57fa\u52dd\u5b9d) is an early form of Japanese currency that was issued in 760 (Tenpy\u014d-h\u014dji 4) during the Nara period. These coins were struck in a gold alloy, and have a circular square hole in the middle. Very few \"Kaiki Shoho\" coins were minted as they were possibly an early experiment. This has made surviving examples rare with only 32 known coins.\nHistory\nAn example of \"Kaiki Shoho\" in the Tokyo National Museum\n\"Kaiki Shoho\" coins were issued in the fourth year of Tenpy\u014d-h\u014dji (760) during the reign of Emperor Junnin along with silver Taihei Genp\u014d, and bronze Mannen Ts\u016bh\u014d coins. All three of these denominations are said to have characters written by scholar Kibi no Makibi. \"Kaiki Shoho\" in particular were minted on the order of Daij\u014d-daijin Fujiwara no Nakamaro, who was leading the government at the time. They were fixed in value and had an exchange ratio of 1 gold Kaiki Shoho coin for 10 silver Taihei Genp\u014d or 100 bronze Mannen Ts\u016bh\u014d coins.\nBased on historical sources and archaeological evidence, Kaiki Shoho were probably not widely distributed. These is no given evidence that Kaiki Shoho actually circulated as currency, and the coins may have acted as \"show money\". Anthropologist Neil Gordon Munro remarked that Kaiki Shoho was intended to be the \"pioneer of a gold currency\". He concluded however, that the country was too poor at the time to \"warrant such an experiment being carried out on a large scale.\"\nThese coins were eventually lost to history until 1794 (Kansei 6) when one piece was excavated from the ruins of Saidai-ji. It was then kept at Saidai-ji as a treasure until 1876 (Meiji 6) when it was offered to the emperor as he visited. As the coin passed into the Imperial family it eventually became a national treasure. It was noted in 1903 by \"The Japan Weekly Mail\" that this unique coin \"left only a host of conjectures\" on its origin. In 1937 (Showa 12) when 31 more coins were discovered by chance during land clearing for a residential area. All 32 coins are now kept as cultural artifacts which are managed by the Japanese government.\n",
    "Mountain in Medina, Saudi Arabia\nAyr Mountain is one of the largest mountains in Medina, about seven kilometers from the Prophet's Mosque, and was mentioned in the hadith of Muhammad as one of the borders of the city from the southern side. It is one of the two mountains referred to in what Muhammad said when he oversaw the city, \"O Allah, I make sacred what lies between these two mountains as Abraham made Mecca sacred, O Allah, bless them\". Ayr Mountain is considered an important landmark in Medina, as it represents the border of the city's campus from the southern side. As Muhammad made it a marker of the boundaries of this campus, in the two sahihs from the hadith of Ibrahim al-Taimi Muhammad said: \"That the city is between Ayr and Thawr\".\nHistory\nThe city's military governor, Fakhri Pasha, established buildings, castles, and structures on the mountain between 1336 and 1337 when Banu Hashim besieged the city. Fakhri Pasha used these buildings to store ammunition and install cannons, and their locations were known as cannon rackets or fire rackets. These buildings were built with stones similar to the style of the Uhud Mountain citadel in an irregular molasses stone pattern.\nLocation\nAyr Mountain is located in the southwestern region of Medina and east of Al-Aqiq Valley near Dhi al-Halifa and Ali's wells. It is 8 miles away from the Prophet's Mosque, with an average width of 700 meters and an altitude of about 955 meters above sea level. It extends from east to west and is a straight black mountain with a flat surface and no peak, the Jeddah-bound traveler will see it after passing the Quba Mosque on its left, and it is one of the borders of Medina on the southern side.\nNaming\nIt was named Ayr to resemble the back of a donkey, stretching almost 2,000 meters in length. Ubaydullah Amin Kurdi commented in his book The Famous Mountains of Medina that Ayr Mountain can be called Ayer as well.\nSaid about Ayr Mountain\nLocated in the region of Medina and east of Al-Aqiq Valley near Dhi al-Halifa and Ali's wells, and one of its borders on the southern side. One of the mountains the Muhammad made it a marker of the boundaries of the city as well forbade hunting between the two mountains according to hadith. Above it is another mountain with the same name, which is called Ayr Outgoing and Ayr Incoming. In hadith of Muhammad: \"Uhud is in one of heaven's corners, and Ayr is in one of hell's corners\". In a narration by Ibn Majah: \"It is narrated that Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it, and it is on a stream from the streams of Paradise, and Ayr is on a stream from the streams of Hell\".\nIn the book Antiquities of Medina by Abdul Quddus Al-Ansari, p.205: \"Ayr and Thawr are the names of two of the mountains of Medina, the first is a large, towering structure located south of the city, about two hours away by unhurried walking, and the second is a small red one located north of Uhud. They border the city's precincts to the south and north, I climbed to the top of Mount Ayr in one of the months of the year 1347 AH, and I found it to be a cool, flat area where the wind blows, even though the season was summer, so it is suitable for the establishment of sanatoriums on it\".\nAyr in the islamic narrative\nFirst\nAyr, in another narrative is not one of the mountains of Hell, and what was reported in this regard can be considered not authentic. Ibn Majah (3115) narrated from Muhammad ibn Ishaq on the authority of Abdullah ibn Makanif, who said: \"I heard Anas ibn Malik saying that Muhammad said that Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it, and it is on a stream from the streams of Paradise, and Ayr is on a stream from the streams of Hell\". And that he considered it as a weak chain of narration, as Al-Busiri said that it is a weak chain of narration in his book The Bottle Lamp (3/ 218). Al-Albani said it is very week in his book Ad-Da'ifah (1820). Al-Tabarani narrated in Al-Kabir (6505) mentioned that it was narrated by Abd al-Majid, son of Abu Abs, son of Jabr, from his father, from his grandfather Muhammad, that he said: \"Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it, it is at one of the gates of Paradise, and this is Ayr, who hates us and we hate it, and it is at one of the gates of the Hellfire\", which he also considered it to be a weak chain of narration.\nAl-Haythami said in his book Majma al-Zawa'id (4/ 13): \"In it, there is Abd al-Majid, son of Abu Abs, whom I know, and there are others whom I do not know\". Also Al-Albani in his book Ad-Da'ifah mark it as weak (1618). As for the first part of the hadith (Uhud is a mountain that loves us and we love it) it is agreed on its authenticity, narrated by Bukhari (2889) and Muslim (1365).\nSecond\nAyr Mountain is within the boundaries of Madinah, as narrated by Bukhari (6755) and Muslim (1370). The sanctuary of Medina ends and the open space begins from outside the boundaries set by Muhammad, which are Mountains Ayr and Thawr. So based on that it can be considered t",
    "2017 Polish film by Jagoda Szelc\nWie\u017ca. Jasny dzie\u0144 (English: Tower. A Bright Day) is a Polish drama film from 2017, directed by Jagoda Szelc, based on her original screenplay.\nThe film revolves around the clash between the traditionalist Mula and her sister Kaja, who compete for the right to raise Nina, Kaja's biological daughter. Szelc received awards for her directorial debut and screenplay at the Gdynia Film Festival and was honored with the Polityka Passport. Reviewers of the film repeatedly emphasized its references to the tradition of Polish Romanticism and the work of European filmmakers such as Lars von Trier and Yorgos Lanthimos.\nPlot\nOn the occasion of Nina's First Communion, her parents, Mula and Micha\u0142, invite their family to their home in the K\u0142odzko Valley. Soon, Mula's siblings join them \u2013 her sister Kaja and brother Andrzej with his wife Anna and children. It turns out that Kaja is Nina's biological mother, who disappeared for several years after giving birth to the child, and Nina was raised by Mula, who also takes care of their sick mother. Mula, who is busy with various responsibilities, harbors resentment towards her sister and fears that her presence might disrupt her relationship with Nina. Upon the arrival of the guests, a series of irrational events unfolds \u2013 the sisters' mother regains her health, and Nina refuses to participate in her communion.\nCast\nAnna Krotoska \u2013 Mula\nMa\u0142gorzata Szczerbowska \u2013 Kaja, Mula's sister\nAnna Zubrzycka \u2013 Ada, mother of Mula, Kaja and Andrzej\nDorota \u0141ukasiewicz-Kwietniewska \u2013 Anna, Andrzej's wife\nRafa\u0142 Kwietniewski \u2013 Andrzej, Mula's brother\nRafa\u0142 Cieluch \u2013 Micha\u0142, Mula's husband\nLaila Hennessy \u2013 Nina\nIda Kwietniewska \u2013 Dusia, Anna and Andrzej's daughter\nIgor Kwietniewski \u2013 Igor, Anna and Andrzej's son\nArtur Krajewski \u2013 priest\nBogus\u0142awa Sztencel \u2013 Miss Wanda\nMohammed Almughanni \u2013 refugee\nJ\u0119drzej Wielecki \u2013 pilgrim\nMi\u0142osz Karbownik \u2013 pilgrim\nMiko\u0142aj Chroboczek \u2013 pilgrim\nMaciej Miszczak \u2013 pilgrim\nMonika Strzelczyk \u2013 woman\nHanna Misiak \u2013 woman\nJoanna Nowicka-Zagrajek \u2013 woman\nJoanna \u0141u\u017cny \u2013 woman\nArkadiusz Zagrajek \u2013 man\nAlicja Pachowicz \u2013 fair-haired girl\nProduction\nThe production of the film was managed by the Indeks Studio, established by the then rector of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Film School, Mariusz Grzegorzek. The creation of the studio aimed to assist future graduates of the school in making non-commercial, original debuts. One of the students of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Film School who benefited from this initiative was Jagoda Szelc. When creating her feature debut, Szelc intended Wie\u017ca. Jasny dzie\u0144 to be a protest song against the destructive ambitions of humanity:On a micro scale, it tells the story of a family crisis, but on a macro scale, it's a story about the obsession with control: the daily pursuit, perceiving ambition as a positive value, and the belief that love can be owned. This set of features is something that stands in direct opposition to our nature; it's like a denial of the primal attitude of 'let it go'.For the film, Szelc planned to adopt a naturalistic style, so she decided to forgo professional actors: I wanted them to be people who were somewhat unknown but very credible. Therefore, in the lead roles, non-professional actors Anna Krotoska and Ma\u0142gorzata Szczerbowska were cast, attracted by Szelc's working method. Krotoska described her participation in the film as the most beautiful work I've done so far.\nThe cinematography for Wie\u017ca. Jasny dzie\u0144 was handled by Przemys\u0142aw Brynkiewicz. The shooting period began on 23 May 2016, in the K\u0142odzko Valley. The total budget of the film was around 2.3 million PLN, with almost 1.5 million PLN covered by the Polish Film Institute. The film was completed in 2017 after editing by Anna Garncarczyk and was then entered into festival circulation. It was first presented at the Gdynia Film Festival on 19 September 2017. The theatrical premiere of Wie\u017ca. Jasny dzie\u0144 took place on 23 March 2018.\nReception\nCinematic attendance\nDomestic cinemas reported low audience attendance at screenings of the film. According to estimates by the Polish Film Institute, it was seen by just over 23,000 viewers.\nJagoda Szelc, director of the film (2018)\nCritical reception in Poland\nThe film was generally well received by critics. Jakub Popielecki from the Filmweb portal argued that Szelc embarks on a tale about the human condition. The horror here is primarily the horror of existence, the tragedy of an uncomfortable sprawl in which humanity finds itself. Popielecki drew comparisons between Wie\u017ca. Jasny dzie\u0144 and Lars von Trier's Antichrist as well as the cinema of Mariusz Grzegorzka. \u0141ukasz Maciejewski claimed that Szelc's film would appeal to Maria Janion thanks to its constant references to Polish Romanticism, although he also noticed allusions to films by Yorgos Lanthimos and the ancient Greek myth of Medea. Grzegorz Fortuna Jr. in Kino magazine elaborated on a romantic interpretation, stating that Jagoda Szelc reaches into the vast closet of S",
    "Municipal building in Dunwich, Suffolk, England\nThe Old Town Hall is a former municipal building in St James's Street in Dunwich, a village in Suffolk, England. The building, which is currently operates as holiday accommodation, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nThe first town hall in the town was a medieval structure which may have dated back to the time that King John visited the town and presented a charter in 1216. It may well have also served as the headquarters of the local merchant's guild. Following some coastal erosion, it was rebuilt on a new site in 1663. However, the town was devastated by coastal flooding in 1702: St Peters Church was so badly damaged that it had to be dismantled, and the town hall was destroyed.\nCivic leaders decided to re-erect the whole town, including the town hall, some 0.25 miles (0.40\u00a0km) inland to protect it from the continuing coastal erosion.  The new town hall was designed in the Tudor style, built using timber frame construction techniques and completed a few years later, probably about 1705. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of two bays facing onto St James's Street. The town archives were locked in an ancient iron chest, made in The Netherlands and kept in one of the rooms in the building.\nDunwich had a very small electorate and, as most of the town had disappeared under the sea, it was recognised by the UK Parliament as a rotten borough. Its right to elect members of parliament was removed by the Reform Act 1832, and its borough council, which met in the town hall, was reformed under the Municipal Corporations Act 1883. The assets of the corporation, including the town hall, were transferred to a specially formed entity, the Dunwich Town Trust, with the lord of the manor, Colonel St John Barne of Sotterley Manor, becoming the first chairman of the trust in 1889. The town hall was subsequently converted for residential use and currently operates as holiday accommodation.\nArchitecture\nThe building has a timber-framed core, with red brick external walls, with the facade being plastered, and a pantiled roof. It has two storeys and an attic, with two windows on each floor, and a single dormer window in the attic with wide bargeboards. The windows are in the Gothic style, with diamond lattice lights.  There is a two-storey extension to the right, linking it to the next house, with a 20th-century door. It was grade II listed in 1984.\n",
    "Greek railway station\nPraggion railway station (Greek: \u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03a0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd, romanized:\u00a0Sidirodromiki stasi Praggion) is a small unstaffed\nrailway station that serves the village of Praggion, Evros, in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Located southwest of the settlement, Today Hellenic Train operates just two daily regional trains to Alexandroupoli and Ormenio.\nHistory\nThe railway was an important link during World War I as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary were all Central Allies. After the Ottoman Empire's defeat, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi) in Turkey serving Edirne Karaaga\u00e7 station and for 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi) between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (CFFH), a subsidiary of the CO, when the CFFH was incorporated in July 1929.\nUnder the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, resulted in the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entering Greece at Pythio, then re-entering Turkey at Edirne (Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 railway station), re-entering Greece at Marasia, and finally entering Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad. This arrangement continued until 1971 when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed through Feres. In Greece, a line was opened to allow trains from Pythio to Bulgaria to stay on Greek territory and avoid Edirne. In 1954 the CFFH was absorbed by the Hellenic State Railways. In 1971, the Hellenic State Railways was reorganised into the OSE taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure.\nIn the 1990s, OSE introduced the InterCity service to the Alexandroupoli\u2013Svilengrad line Which reduced travel times across the whole line.\nIn 2020 it was announced that the section of line between Pythio and Ormenio was to be upgraded, at the cost of \u20ac1.4 million as part of an ambitious integrated intergovernmental transport plan which will see this, and 39 other transport sector projects be built, with financing from the European Commission with a total of \u20ac117\u00a0million. The package of measures aims to build or improve transport connections and connectivity across Europe, with a focus on sustainable transport. The project for the Pythian-Ormenio section envisions upgrading the existing line infrastructure and trackbed, doubling of the track as well as the installation of electrification signalling (ETCS Level 1) along the entire stretch, with the aim of improving freight transport with Bulgaria and Turkey.\nFacilities\nThe station is housed in a 1970s building that houses a waiting shelter. Besides this, the station has no other facilities. The platform, which is long for this region, has no outside seating, Dot-matrix display departure and arrival screens, nor timetable poster boards for passenger information; the station remains little more than an unstaffed halt. Access to the station is via stairs from the street, which means the station is not disabled accessible. Next to the station is The Tavern, surviving local food which opens up to the station concourse.\nServices\nAs of 2020, the stop is only served by one daily pair of regional trains Alexandroupoli\u2013Ormenio. There are currently no services to Svilengrad.\nThe station has an adjacent bus stop, with limited services to Dikaia and Alexandroupoli Port.\nLine layout\n",
    "\nThe Capture of Cobija or Peruvian occupation of Cobija was a war action that occurred within the framework of the Salaverry-Santa Cruz War that took place in the Bolivian port of Cobija between the Peruvian expedition of Colonel Jos\u00e9 Quiroga and the garrison under the command of Colonel Gaspar Aramayo.\nBackground\nAfter the declaration of the \"war to the death\" from Salaverry to Santa Cruz on July 8, 1835, the self-proclaimed supreme leader of Peru ordered the start of hostilities by ordering Colonel Quiroga to surprise the Bolivian port of Cobija. Quiroga, in command of 260 soldiers from the 1st battalion of Carabineros de la Guardia, embarked on the corvette \"Libertad\" and the schooner \"Lime\u00f1a\", left the port of Callao on September 4, 1835, arriving on the Bolivian coast 18 days later and disembarking his ship. troops in the bay of Mejillones, 16 leagues south of Cobija.\nThe Battle\nAfter two days of marching through sandbanks and gorges, the Peruvian troops appeared in sight of the port garrison made up of 87 soldiers and militiamen and which also had a fort defended by 18 artillery pieces of various calibers. Quiroga ordered his men to advance as a guerrilla towards the Bolivian positions, ordering not to fire a shot until they reached 100 paces from the Bolivian positions, the left wing led by Sergeant Major Andrade and the right by Captain Salaverry (brother of the supreme chief). The restorers advanced to the ordered distance under the cannon and rifle fire directed at them by the defenders, subsequently holding a lively shootout for two hours in which the leader of the square, Colonel Gaspar Aramayo, a lieutenant and 9 soldiers were killed. another 8 wounded, their leader fallen and understanding the futility of continuing to resist, the garrison surrendered, sending the citizen-soldier Antonio Molina as a parliamentarian to communicate the surrender of the square after which the batteries, the port and the city fell into the power of the Peruvians who had 11 dead and 18 wounded during the action. According to the Peruvian historian Manuel Nemesio Vargas, Aramayo would not have defeated Quiroga alive.\n",
    "Greek railway station\nPetrades railway station (Greek: \u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, romanized:\u00a0Sidirodromiki stasi Petrades) is a small unstaffed\nrailway station that serves the village of Petrades, Evros, in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Located 1.3 kilometres (0.81\u00a0mi) south of the centre of the settlement, Today Hellenic Train operates just two daily regional trains to Alexandroupoli and Ormenio. It is both one of the northernmost and the eastern most operational railway stations in Greece, close to both the Bulgarian and Turkish borders.\nHistory\nThe railway was an important link during World War I as the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary were all Central Allies. After the Ottoman Empire's defeat, its remaining imperial possessions were divided. The sections from Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad, except for a short section of about 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi) in Turkey serving Edirne Karaaga\u00e7 station and for 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi) between the Greek border and Svilengrad station in Bulgaria come under the control of the French-Hellenic Railway Company (CFFH), a subsidiary of the CO, when the CFFH was incorporated in July 1929.\nUnder the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, a new border between Greece and Turkey was established at the Evros river, just east of Ftelia railway station, which had the result that the railway from Istanbul to Bulgaria entered Greece at Pythio, then re-entered Turkey at Edirne (Karaa\u011fa\u00e7 railway station), re-entered Greece at Marasia, and finally entered Bulgaria between Ormenio and Svilengrad.  This arrangement continued until 1971 when two new lines were opened. In Turkey, the Edirne Cut-off was opened to allow trains from Istanbul to Bulgaria to run through Edirne entirely on Turkish territory so that trains such as the Orient Express no longer passed through Feres.

    "Spanish pharmacist and footballer\nAdolfo Bracero Garc\u00eda (22 October 1909 \u2013 30 August 1978) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Real Madrid, and Sevilla FC. He is one of the few players who played for both Sevilla and Madrid. He later became a manager, taking charge over Real Ja\u00e9n and Granada CF in the 1950s.\nPlaying career\nAdolfo Bracero was born on 22 October 1909 in Huelva, and began his footballing career at Sevilla FC in 1931, with whom he played for five years until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. During his time at Seville, he helped his club win the 1935 Spanish Cup, starting in the final against Sabadell, which ended in a 3\u20130 victory.\nOnce the conflict was over, Bracero joined Club Aviaci\u00f3n, the future Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where he was a member of Athletic's historic 1939\u201340 season, in which the club won the 1939 Campeonato Mancomunado Centro and the 1939\u201340 La Liga under coach Ricardo Zamora; however, he did not play a major role in these triumphs since he only started two league matches during the season. He went on to join Real Madrid, where he again had few chances, playing only three matches for the whites. In total, he scored six goals in 19 league matches for Sevilla, Atl\u00e9tico, and Madrid. He then played for UD Salamanca and Recreativo de Huelva, where he retired in 1945.\nManagerial career\nAfter his career as a player ended, Bracero remained linked to Recreativo de Huelva, now as a coach, which he oversaw between 1945 and 1947. Following a brief stint at the helm of CD Iliturgi in 1947\u201348 and a three-year hiatus, he took charge of Tercera Divisi\u00f3n club Real Ja\u00e9n in 1951, and in his first season at the club, Bracero guided them to promotion to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n as well as the 1951\u201352 Copa Federaci\u00f3n de Espa\u00f1a, in which they defeated Orensana 3\u20131 in the final. The promotion match took place against UD Almer\u00eda on 6 April 1952, and they won 3\u20130. In the following season, he guided the club to another promotion, this time to the first division, the club's first and only such season in its history.\nBracero went on to manage Granada CF (1953\u201354), CD San Fernando (1955\u201356), CD Badajoz (1956\u201360), UD Salamanca (1961\u201362), and again Recreativo de Huelva (1964\u201365).

    "Spanish footballer\nAntonio Bar\u00f3 was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for FC Espanya in the 1910s.\nClub career\nBorn in Catalonia, Bar\u00f3 began his career at his hometown club FC Espanya in the early-1910s, where he formed an attacking partnership with Gabriel Bau and Casimiro Mallorqu\u00ed, and quickly became a key element of the team, going on to play with them for nearly a decade. He was one of the most important players in the team's rise to become a powerhouse in Catalonia, competing head-to-head against the likes of Barcelona and Espanyol, being crucial in helping the club win three Catalan championships (1912\u201313, 1913\u201314 and 1916\u201317) and the 1914 Pyrenees Cup, scoring once in the semifinals against FC Barcelona in an enventual 5\u20132 victory.\nBar\u00f3 also scored once in the semifinals of the 1914 Copa del Rey against Sociedad Gimn\u00e1stica, netting a late equalizer in the second leg to give Espanya a 2\u20131 aggregate win, thus contributing decisively in helping the club reach the final, which still is the club's only Copa del Rey final appearance, but they lost 1\u20132 to Athletic Bilbao, courtesy of a brace from Severino Zuazo.\nInternational career\nLike many other FC Espanya players of that time, Bar\u00f3 played several matches for the Catalonia national team, being a member of the Catalan side that played in the first edition of the Prince of Asturias Cup in 1915, an inter-regional competition organized by the RFEF. At the tournament, he formed an attacking partnership with the forwards of FC Barcelona, Vicente Mart\u00ednez, Enrique Peris, and Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, the latter scoring the competition's first-ever goal against the Centro team (a Castile/Madrid XI) on 10 May, while Bar\u00f3 netted the winner in a 2\u20131 victory.

    "American actress\nFlorence Ravenel (March 18, 1896 \u2013 December 18, 1975) also known as Florence Ray, was an American stage, radio and film actress, perhaps best known for her work on the radio series The Court of Missing Heirs, and on the TV sitcom The Farmer's Daughter.\nEarly life and career\nBorn in Michigan, but raised primarily in Brooklyn, New York, Ravenel attended Hunter College and the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.\nStage\nRavenel made her professional dramatic debut\u2014billed as Florence Ravanel\u2014in the fall of 1923 with the William Augustin Players in Gloucester, Massachusetts.  Of her performance in Avery Hopwood's Fair and Warmer, Billboard reported, \"Florence Ravanel made a hit as Laura Bartlett\". Shortly thereafter, Ravenel found more lucrative employment with the Al Luttringer Players.  Towards the end of a three-week engagement with that troupe at the Music Hall Theatre in Akron, Ohio (featuring The Cat and the Canary, Getting Gertie's Garter, Guy Bolton's Polly, Preferred, and My Irish Cinderella), The Beacon Journal singled out Ravenel's contribution, noting that the actress had tackled \"hard roles and won praise from her audience.\"\nBetween 1925 and 1927, Ravenel appeared in stock company revivals of Lightnin' (portraying Mildred Buckley, \"and doing it with a certain charm\"), Parlor, Bedroom and Bath as Angelica Irving (a role previously played onscreen by Kathleen Kirkham, and subsequently by Dorothy Christy) and, as Madeleine, in the Goodman-Knoblock adaptation of Robert Keable's Simon Called Peter. Also in 1927, she appeared \"to splendid advantage\" alongside Jack Davis and William Rath as Keala Leilani in the premiere of Tropical Love, a South Seas-set melodrama staged at the Majestic Theatre in Waukegan, Illinois. At that same venue the following month, Ravenel was the main attraction in Anita Loos' Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, \"giv an absorbing performance of the part\u2014i.e. Lorelei Lee\u2014which was played by June Walker in New York\"\nAs of February 1928, Ravenel appears to have taken up residence in Chicago, Illinois, where her membership in that city's Associate Players was advertised in the Southtown Economist. In March, the company's production of Avery Hopwood's The Alarm Clock featured Ravenel as Mrs. Dunsmore. That summer, Ravenel toured with Jeanne Eagels' company in a vaudeville recreation of scenes from Eagels' recent vehicle, The Cardboard Lover. The following year, she gave a well-received performance as Arlette in a revival of Seventh Heaven staged by the Guy and Eloda Beach stock company in La Crosse, Wisconsin.\nRadio\nIn 1933, Ravenel was promoted from the ranks of KYW staffers to host the station's daily noontime dance program featuring Rex Maupin's orchestra. Beginning in the fall of 1937, Ravenel was heard, alongside Jack Brinkley, Elizabeth Reller, Dorothy Day, Henry Saxe, John Goldsworthy, Bob Middleton, and others in The Court of Missing Heirs. She was also featured as Mrs. Sniffer on Arnold Grimm's Daughter. On January 30, 1943, Ravenel was one of the few non-singing performers heard in Chicago Theater of the Air's production of Victor Herbert's Sweethearts. In 1948, Ravenel, Parley Baer, Jerry Farber and announcer Patrick McGeehan were among those featured on the Catholic program, The Hour of St. Francis. Beginning in 1951, she co-starred with Lamont Johnson, Raymond Burr and Ruth Swanson in The Pendleton Story, produced by the Armed Forces Radio Service, described as the service's \"first family series for overseas release.\"\nBetween 1950 and 1952, Ravenel also appeared in at least two episodes each of Dr. Christian and NBC Theater, most notably in the latter's production of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler, starring Virginia Christine and featuring Ravenel as Aunt Julie.\nFilm and television\nIn the fall of 1951, Ravenel joined 12 fellow former radio actors in the cast of Arch Oboler's The Twonky.\nMaking a brief return to the stage in 1956, Ravenel appeared with Naomi Stevens and many others in what The Hollywood Reporter's Marvin Smith judged a much-improved revival of Sumner Locke Elliott's unsuccessful Broadway comedy, Buy Me Blue Ribbons, providing an ideal showcase for the show's star, a young Paul Smith.\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nPersonal life and death\nOn December 18, 1975, Ravenel died at age 79 in Los Angeles of undisclosed causes, predeceased by her mother.\n",
    "\nPaul Zech (19 February 1881 \u2013 7 September 1946) was a German expressionist writer and poet.\nBiography\nPaul Zech came from the large family of a craftsman as the eldest of six surviving children. At the age of 5, he was entrusted to his maternal grandparents. He attended school until the age of 14 and then began an apprenticeship in baking which was unsuccessful. He then left for Belgium to work in the coal mines of the Charleroi basin, in 1898. Back in Germany he married Helene Siemon, a shoemaker's daughter in July 1904, whom he had a child with.\nZech began writing his first poems in 1901. His poems were published in local or regional magazines. In 1907, he took part in the annual Cologne poetry competition and received \u201chonorable mention\u201d. From 1910 he lived in Berlin and turned to poetry. \u00a0He published in Herwarth Walden's expressionist journal Der Sturm and founded his own publication Das neue Pathos. His poems earned him the Kleist Prize in 1918. While keeping a classic form, his poems reveal a tendency towards expressionism through the themes of the city, mines, oppression, and alienation.\nAt the start of the First World War, in 1914 Zech wrote patriotic poems but by 1915, his enthusiasm for the war gave way to skepticism. He participated in the battles on the Western Front, notably at the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme. In the summer of 1916 he was seriously injured when he was buried in a trench. He was decorated with the Iron Cross. In 1917, he was assigned to the rear of the front. He then wrote propaganda texts for the army. Under the pseudonym Michel Michael, he published pacifist poems in 1919.\nThe years immediately after the war were the high point of the literary career. In 1918 he was again awarded the Kleist Prize for his poetry. His financial wealth allowed him to acquire a small house near Lake Bestensee to the southeast of Berlin. Severe mental problems forced him to spend several months in a psychiatric hospital. He subsequently led a double life. He had a relationship with singer Hilde Herb, which led to financial setbacks.\nDespite his many difficulties, he was extremely creative in the post-war years. In 1921, he published anonymously erotic poems (Allegro de Plaisir), including sonnets inspired by his relationship with the young Hilde Herb. He also wrote autobiographical stories such as The Mad Heart (1925), The Journey of Pain (1925). He also wrote essays and literary dramas. He adapted Le Bateau ivre by Arthur Rimbaud for the theater in 1926.\nMemorial plaque\nAt first in August 1933, suspected of embezzlement and theft, he left Berlin for Vienna and Trieste and embarked there for Montevideo, Buenos Aires. As a supporter of the SPD and prominent left-wing intellectual, Zech did not return to Nazi Germany. He became popular with the German anti-Nazi community in Argentina. At the end of the Second World War, he decided to return to Germany but was not able to do so because of his financial difficulties. He died in Buenos Aires after suffering an illness in September 1946.\nHis urn was moved to the St\u00e4dtischer Friedhof III cemetery in Berlin-Friedenau in 1971.

    "Spanish engineer, lawyer, and politician\nAlberto Bosch y Fustegueras (26 December 1848 \u2013 13 May 1900) was a Spanish engineer, lawyer, and politician, who served as a Mayor of Madrid twice, in 1885 and in 1891\u201392, and later as a Development Minister of Spain during the Regency of Maria Christina of Austria. He was also a Deputy of Spain for Roquetes, Tarragona, between 1881 and 1884, a Senator for the Economic Society of Madrid between 1886 and 1890, and then for life between 1891 and 1900.\nHe was a president of the Real Sociedad Econ\u00f3mica Matritense de Amigos del Pa\u00eds\u00a0 and of the Faculty of Sciences and Letters, and also worked as an assistant professor of Mathematical Physics at the Central University. He was the author of many and varied scientific productions, most notably Estudios trigonom\u00e9tricos, Manual de Astronom\u00eda popular, La agricultura espa\u00f1ola en el siglo XIX, and Geometr\u00eda aplicada a las Artes.\nEarly and education\nAlberto Bosch was born in Tortosa on 26 December 1848, as the son of Miguel Bosch and Maria Antonia Fustegueras y Bag\u00e1. His father, a forestry engineer and surgeon at the same time, had a certain public profile in the former area, as a member of official organizations and author of technical works.\nBosch completed his secondary and university studies in Madrid, the city where the family lived for a long time, and accumulated up to three degrees, obtaining a doctorate in law and also graduating in Exact Sciences and civil engineering. As a result of the wide range of his degrees, he diversified his actions in his first years of professional activity, beginning careers in medicine and pharmacy. His political career only began in 1873, at the age of 25, when he joined the Conservative Party.\nProfessional career\nAs an engineer, Bosch was a member of the Roads, Canals, and Ports school\u00a0 and worked in the early 1870s on the topographic map prepared by the Geographic Institute. He maintained his assignment to said body in the following years, although in a supernumerary position.\nAs a lawyer, Bosch presided over the Legal Academy in Madrid in the 1876\u201377 academic year and was a professor at the Royal Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation. Although he barely worked, his participation can be cited in the report prepared in 1882 by a group of jurists for the Transatlantic Company, regarding the awarding of the mail steamer service to the Antilles. He was also a director of the Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad de Madrid.\nAs an academic, Bosch was closely linked to the Real Sociedad Econ\u00f3mica Matritense de Amigos del Pa\u00eds, and in 1875, he published in the context of its centenary, the work El Centenario: apuntes para la historia de la Sociedad Econ\u00f3mica Matritense. Later he came to preside over it and obtained several elections to the Senate for the corporate seat belonging to the entity. On 23 March 1890 he entered the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences with the speech \"Applications of mathematics to moral and political sciences\", and he stayed there until his death 10 years later. As a mathematician, he also entered the University of Madrid as an assistant professor of Mathematical Physics. He published many and varied scientific productions, including Estudios trigonom\u00e9tricos (1875) at the university level and, with a more informative intention, Manual de Astronom\u00eda popular (1879) and Elementos de fisiolog\u00eda (1882).\nPolitic career\nBosch began his political career around 1873 when he joined the Conservative Party. He held his first parliamentary representation in 1878, when he premiered as a deputy for the district of Roquetes, Tarragona, within the Cortes of 1876\u20131879, the first of the Restoration. He repeated his seat in the elections of 1879 and 1881, and in 1886 he was appointed senator by the Economic Society of Madrid.\nA member of the Conservative Party of Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo, Bosch was in the sector headed by Francisco Romero Robledo. While he was Minister of the Interior, he was appointed general director of Penal Establishments (9 March 1880 to 12 February 1881), and as such he attended the International Penitentiary Conference held in Paris in November 1880, and wrote a technical memory upon his return. Upon taking office, he had to cease being a deputy; however, he was re-elected in the following year, in the elections of 1881, wherein a demonstration of his growing political strength, he obtained simultaneous election as deputy for Roquetas and as senator for the Economic Society of Madrid, and despite being in the opposition, he opted for the first of these representations. Always an active deputy, Bosch consolidated himself in the Cortes of 1881\u20131884 as one of the main assets of the so-called \"hussars\", the political sector headed by Romero. In 1883 he was appointed member of the official commission in charge of organizing Spanish participation in the International Colonial and Export Exhibition in Amsterdam.\nBosch caricatured by Mecachis.\nIn 1884, Bosch married Elena H",
    "\nThe Integrated Aqua-Vegeculture System (iAVs) is a food production method that combines aquaculture and olericulture  within a closed system. It was developed in the 1980s by Dr. Mark McMurtry and colleagues at North Carolina State University including Professor Doug Sanders, Paul V. Nelson and Merle Jensen. This system is one of the earliest instances of a closed-loop aquaponic system. Many of the modern developments and discoveries of aquaponics are generally attributed to the New Alchemy Institute and North Carolina State University. Further research on aquaponics at North Carolina State University was discontinued due to the fact that the system was ready for commercial application. Today's flood-and-drain systems, as favoured by backyard practitioners, are derived from this model.\nIn an iAVs, fish are raised in tanks, and the nutrient-rich water from these tanks is used to irrigate and fertilize grow beds filled with plants that take up the nutrients, purifying the water, which is then recirculated back to the fish tanks. The system uses sand-based grow beds to perform multiple functions, including plant support, biofiltration, particulate removal, and nutrient delivery to plants, without the need for separate biofilters. This multi-functional use of sand beds contributes to the relative simplicity of the iAVs design compared to other aquaponic systems.\nIn previous integrated fish-vegetable systems, fish effluent and suspended solids were removed from water through sedimentation before being applied to plants which resulted in insufficient residual nutrients for good plant growth, compared to iAVs, which extracts fish effluent, including solids, from the bottom of the fish tanks at regular intervals up to eight times daily, from dawn to sunset. The effluent is pumped directly onto the surface of the sand beds, which serve as both biological and mechanical filtration and the locus for oxidation of organic solids.\nIn traditional recirculatory aquaculture, carbonate inputs have been used to neutralize the acidification resulting from nitrification. However, researchers found that alkaline amendment was unnecessary when the nitrogen input rate approximated the nitrogen assimilation rates of the plants. In the IAVS research, water pH remained stable at approximately pH 6.0 when fish-feed rates were not excessive.\nIAVS is also referred to as Sandponics which is actually a trademark for Agricultural cultivating equipment.\nExternal links\nIAVS Official Website\n",
    "1912 play by J. Hartley Manners\nFor other uses, see Peg o' My Heart (disambiguation).\nPeg o' My Heart is a 1912 play written by J. Hartley Manners. It has three acts, a medium-sized cast, one setting, and moderate pacing. The story is set at the English mansion of the socially prominent Chichester family, whose lives are changed by the introduction of an Irish-American heiress into their midst.\nIt was first produced by Oliver Morosco and staged by the playwright. The massive single setting was designed by Robert Brunton. The play  starred Laurette Taylor, who had recently signed a three-year contract with Morosco. It opened in Los Angeles during May 1912, where it ran for eleven weeks. Its Broadway premiere came in December 1912. It was a huge success there, playing over 600 times through May 1914, establishing new records \"for longest consecutive run of any comedy in New York City\" and continuous performances by a female star. Critical reviews on both coasts emphasized the importance of Taylor's performance over the content of the play.\nMorosco had announced a prize to write a song for the play in March 1912; a year later the winner Peg o' My Heart was released, also to popular success. Manners published his play, but he also published a novel expanding and encompassing the comedy with background and future events. The play had a moderately successful Broadway revival from February through April 1921, and was the basis for a 1922 silent film and a 1933 musical.\nCharacters\nCharacters are listed in order of appearance within their scope, and as defined in 1912 cast lists.

    "Fictional character from E4 soap opera Hollyoaks\nSoap opera character\nRo Hutchinson is a fictional character from the British E4 soap opera Hollyoaks and is portrayed by child actress Ava Webster. He made his first appearance in episode 3718, originally broadcast on 23 October 2013. Ro is the son of Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) and Diane Hutchinson (Alex Fletcher). In February 2024, executive producer Hannah Cheers along with series producer Angelo Abela announced the character was devised in a high-profile transgender storyline, deemed controversial as the character was only at the age of 12. The key episodes that focus on the storyline garnered 358 complaints to Ofcom but have also have received positive acclaim by the media and tabloids. The plot also earned him a nomination for \"Inspiring Storyline of the Year\" at the Radio Times soap awards 2024.\nSince the characters debut, his storylines focused on him being switched at birth with his later adoptive-sister Dee Dee Hutchinson (Annabelle and Charlotte White) after Mariam Andrews (Helen Lederer), a midwife whom was drunk on the job, ended up inadvertently switching the babies, being stuck between a custody battle with the Hutchison's and Lomax's after Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis)'s death, moving in with Tony and Diane, coming out as transgender at the age of 12 and his friendships with Kitty Draper (Iz Hesketh) and Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe).\nCasting\nIt was announced on 13 October 2023 in a \"new\" story for the Hutchinson family, they recast the roles of Ro and Anthony (now William Thompson). The reasoning for so is a \"never been done\" storyline that Fletcher teased. The recast was a first for many child actors and actresses in the long-running soap opera as the production team for Hollyoaks were attempting to resolve the issue of \"disappeared\" actors during covid transmissions, who had little to no screen-time. Fletcher added it was \"something for the family to get their teeth stuck into\" and referred to Webster as a \"goregous little actress\". It was also revealed at some point in October 2023 the character was rapidly aged by two years in a bid for the character to enter more mature written storylines.\n\"This story is gonna be a slow burn, and like I said, I think people are going to really invest in Rose's character, she's just gorgeous and I think when the audience see what she's going to go through, they're going to really feel it with her.\"\n\u2013Alex Fletcher on Ro's recast and upcoming storyline (2023)\nDevelopment\nIdentity storyline\nOn 26 February 2024, it was announced executive producer Hannah Cheers and series producer Angela Abela placed Ro at the forefront of a \"groundbreaking\" storyline that would oversee Ro exploring his gender identity. Ro quizzes new barmaid Kitty Draper (Iz Hesketh) on her journey on coming out as transgender and the reaction she garnered before admitting to her that he doesn't feel comfortable with his gender. Fletcher, who portrays Ro's on-screen mother Diane, praised the storyline. In scenes from episode 6324, originally broadcast on 5 March 2024, Ro comes out as transgender to Tony and Diane. Tony and Diane are struck by the news; struggling to adjust to Ro's decision. Tony and Diane's \"biggest obstacle\" were the new pronouns that Ro identifies with, he/him. Tony, still struggling to adjust is advised by Kitty to take Ro to the hairdressers, Tony then makes the first step with Ro. Carter Shepherd (David Ames), the headteacher at Hollyoaks High, contacts Diane and Tony ahead of Ro's return to school \u2013 suggesting help that is supporting a struggling Lucas Hay (Oscar Curtis). Carter is a secret conversion therapist trying to convert Ro by suggesting he returns to his former name Rose and to \"act\" like his birth gender. Clashing with Carter was already foreshadowed in the spring trailer for 2024. In a heated showdown, Ro hit Carter for his transphobic suggestions. Ro starts a friendship with Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) and Mercedes gives Ro a hat of Bobby Costello (Jayden Fox)'s. Tony then continues to support Ro and takes Ro to shop for clothes that fits his identity \u2013 Diane is unhappy. Ro overheard Kitty confess to Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) about escaping her conversion therapist father Declan Hawthorne (Alan Turkington), who is working with Carter. Ro later has a heated confrontation with Declan, confronting him for his beliefs. Ro is almost attacked but is caught in time by Freddie to run. Carter is later exposed at the Pride festival that Tony and Ro attend which later leads to his arrest. The village then deals with the fall-out from Pride. Realising how impactful and influential Carter's words were, Diane and Ro finally have a breakthrough \u2013 Diane ensures Ro she accepts him and loves him unconditionally.\nReception\nThe gender plot received 358 individual complaints to Ofcom between 4 and 7 March.

    "\nThe Joint Operations Force (Arabic: \u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0643\u0629), formerly known as the 24th Infantry Battalion, is a large military unit composed of well trained military personnel based in the city of Misrata. It has been known to fight off Islamist extremist groups, such as ISIL and Al-Qaeda, as well as participating operations that intercept human traffickers and fuel smugglers. This force commonly advocates for a single unified Libyan military as well as enhancing the security and stability of the country and protecting national sovereignty.\nOrigins\nAfter the 3-month siege that the city of Misrata endured, many battalions began to form in order to resist the constant bombardment by Pro-Gaddafi forces. One of them being the 24th Infantry Battalion.\nAfter the Libyan revolution, this Battalion continued to participate in counter-Terrorism operations. It was later merged with various other groups to form the Joint Operations Force in 2013.\nFunding\nAs of 2023, the J.O.F has been receiving an annual funding of 40,000,000 LYD from the Libyan government. These funds are directed towards countering terrorism operations, human trafficking acts, as well as keeping the city under control, which has resulted in much lower crime rate, making Misrata the safest city in Libya.\nOperations\nOn September 7, 2021, the Misratan Joint Operations Force reported the capture of a high-ranking member of ISIS, Embark al-Khazm, in Bani Walid. Acting on orders from the Attorney General, the Joint Operations Force conducted the arrest. Prime Minister Abdul Hameed Dabaiba of the GNU commended the Joint Operations Force for their efforts and welcomed Khazm's arrest.\n13 March 2023, the J.O.F seized a large shipment of drugs in the port of Misrata. The drugs was discovered to be ecstasy, and was estimated at 1.7 million pills. They were hidden inside a number of cars on board a ship coming from the port of Antwerp, Belgium, carrying about 2,400 cars.\nOn 8 May 2023, the J.O.F announced the successful eradication of 88,000 hallucinogenic tablets discovered aboard a vessel at the Misrata seaport. Acting in accordance with legal protocols and in collaboration with Misrata's port customs, the entire shipment was destroyed to prevent its circulation. The tablets, identified as Levitril or \"Rouge,\" were concealed within two vehicles on board a ship arriving from Italy. This operation marks a significant interception in combating illicit drug trafficking.\n14 May 2023, the J.O.F announced the apprehension of a criminal group responsible for kidnapping and extorting foreign medical personnel from a hospital in Misrata. Following a report of the incident, the Attorney General in Misrata directed a thorough investigation and rescue operation. Subsequently, the kidnappers were captured, and the victims were safely rescued. The arrested individuals confessed to their crimes and were taken into legal custody for prosecution.\nJune 2023, the J.O.F, in collaboration with the Misrata Free Zone customs center, intercepted a large quantity of diesel fuel intended for smuggling out of the country via the Misrata sea port. The fuel, concealed within 14 containers labeled for export as used oils, had a total capacity of 20,000 liters each. Routine inspections led to the discovery, and those responsible were detained pending legal action.\nOn April 20, 2024, the J.O.F received a report stating that two citizens had found a suspicious plastic bag on the beach in a certain area of Misrata city. Immediately, patrols of the force headed to the location where the bag was found. Upon inspection, the bag was found to contain approximately 25 tightly sealed plastic packages containing white powder suspected to be cocaine. In appreciation of the citizens' efforts and \"trust in the Joint Operations Force,\" a financial reward was given to them, \"We urge all citizens to promptly report any suspicious materials or bags that may pose a threat to the security and safety of our country and its people\".\nFebruary 17\nDuring February 17 Annual festival, the February 17 Revolutionary forces in Misrata staged large parades in various locations, including Al-Jazeerat al-A'lam and Tripoli Street, marking the thirteenth anniversary of Gaddafi's overthrow. Tens of thousands of Misratan residents came together to commemorate the revolution. The J.O.F showcased readiness to combat terrorism in all forms, as well as opposition to corruption in all forms.\n",

    "Synthetic element announced by Victor Ninov\nNinovium was a synthetic element that was purportedly discovered in 1999 by Victor Ninov and his team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Initially claimed as element 118, now oganesson, Ninovium's existence was based on alleged decay chains observed during experiments aimed at synthesizing superheavy elements. However, subsequent investigations revealed discrepancies and fabricated data, leading to the retraction of the claimed discovery and the dismissal of Ninov for scientific misconduct.\nEtymology\nThe word Ninovium originates from Victor Ninov's surname, following with the suffix -ium, which is used indicate an entity that is an element according to the IUPAC rules.\nCharacteristics\nNinovium was reported by original observations as a superheavy element. While its exact characteristics remain lost media, theoretical predictions suggest that Ninovium would likely possess a high atomic number, potentially exceeding 118 protons and 184 neutrons in its nucleus. Due to its position in the periodic table, Ninovium would belong to the transactinide series and is expected to exhibit properties similar to other superheavy elements, such as high instability and extremely short half-lives. However, these predictions are based on theoretical models and have not been experimentally confirmed.\nHistory\nDiscovery\nIn 1999, Victor Ninov, along with his team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, reported the creation of element 118 based on observed decay chains. However, further attempts to recreate element weren't successful. Berkeley Laboratory allowed investigation to take place in 2001, which later revealed that data in report was manually modified. Ninov was convicted to be the fabricator of the report, but he denied all allegations of the investigation.\nIn 2002, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia, Dubna has acquired element 118 with use of Californium and Calcium, and named it Oganesson. Research was published in 2006 and International tests confirmed that the element was indeed acquired. Since then Ninov's formula for acquiring 118th element hasn't been proven working.\nRefutation\nThe controversy surrounding Ninovium's discovery led to allegations of scientific misconduct against Victor Ninov, ultimately resulting in his dismissal from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2002.\nDespite the initial claims of its discovery, Ninovium's existence as a valid element remains unsubstantiated, and its characteristics remain uncertain.\n",
    "Village in Colombia\nCorregimiento in Cauca, Colombia\nEl Rosal is a Colombian corregimiento of the municipality of San Sebasti\u00e1n in the Cauca department located on the Colombian Massif. El Rosal limits to the north with the municipality of Almaguer, to the south with the municipality of Santa Rosa, to the east with the Lerma hill and to the west with the municipality of Bol\u00edvar; It has important water sources such as the Ramos River from its source downstream to its mouth in the San Jorge River, to the west with the Hato Fr\u00edo River.\nHistory\nBefore being named El Rosal in 1710,  it was called San Juan de Iscans\u00e9 because it was located near the Ramos River above the small Iscanc\u00e9 Valley, however, its name changed in obedience to a religious event (like in most of the towns in the Colombian Massif), whereby, according to popular belief, the Virgin of Rosary appeared in the town, the place of her appearance determined the location where the Parish of El Rosal was to be built (where it remains today) and with it the first hamlet with walls of bahareque and straw roofs. The territories of the Colombian massif where El Rosal is located were reduced to reservations at the end of the conquest, with the purpose of protecting the few lands that were left to the indigenous people; The lands of the reservations during the colonial period They were always desired by clerics and residents, and defended bushel by bushel by the locals to avoid the usurpation that ended up being imposed, the indigenous people of the region did not inherit the land, but the disputes over it.\n\nEl Rosal was a colonial indigenous resguardo that became extinct around year 1882 \u2014 without land distribution\u2014 and its indigenous council (cabildo) remained until around 1924, when the new church was completed. However, and despite the disappearance of the resguardo, collective memory has remained among its inhabitants, not only as oral memory, but as ritual memory.\nCommunications\nEl Rosal can be reached by car along the road that begins at the Pan-American highway in El Bordo, in the direction of Guachicono and Bol\u00edvar. After eight or nine hours of travel on an unpaved road, which goes up and down mountains passing through all the Andean thermal floors, to reach the town; From there it is possible to return to the Pan-American Highway using the road that goes to the town of Rosas, after crossing the Yanakuna territories of Santiago, Guachicono and R\u00edo Blanco.\nGeography\nEl Rosal sits on a small plateau called Iscanc\u00e9 Valley in the middle of the broken geography of the Colombian Massif, surrounded by mountains that dangerously end in gorges and ravines that descend into deep canyons washed by rapid creeks.\n",
    "Species of lichen\nPeltigera cinnamomea, the dog pelt or cinnamon-pelt lichen, is a species of muscicolous (moss-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Peltigeraceae. The species was formally described by the Canadian lichenologist Trevor Goward in 1995. The lichen is found in forested regions of northwestern North America, particularly in the unique montane and subalpine forest communities of the northern Rocky Mountains. Notably, Peltigera cinnamomea thrives under prolonged snow cover, surviving well into the spring, which distinguishes it from many of the other Peltigera species that inhabit similar North American forest ecosystems.\nPeltigera cinnamomea forms a specialised symbiotic relationship with specific strains of the cyanobacterium Nostoc, which enables it to fix atmospheric nitrogen, crucial for survival in nutrient-poor environments. This lichen is part of the broadly defined species complex centred around the widely distributed Peltigera canina. In this complex, P.\u00a0cinnamomea falls under the CICADE group, indicating a preference for moist, woodland habitats.\nCharacterised by its leafy thallus, which is loosely attached to its substrate, Peltigera cinnamomea typically measures 10\u201330\u00a0cm (4\u201312\u00a0in) in diameter. The thallus has a distinctive appearance, with a dull, billowed upper surface that is covered in a soft, dense growth of hairs. The species name cinnamomea is reflected in the pale tan undersurface of the thallus, which features rusty-brown, cinnamon-coloured veins. The lichen produces apothecia (fruiting bodies) that bear clear, ascospores with three internal partitions.\nTaxonomy\nThe type specimen of Peltigera cinnamomea was collected by the Canadian lichenologist Trevor Goward on 13 April 1985, within the Clearwater River Basin in British Columbia (Canada), at an elevation of 675\u00a0m (2,215\u00a0ft). The lichen was found growing over a mossy boulder situated in a boulder bed in an open, mixed forest. The species was first scientifically documented in a 1994 report on the Peltigera species in Alberta, published by the Provincial Museum of Alberta. It did not, however, meet the specific standards for valid publication of a new species, due to non-compliance with Articles 39.1 and 40.1 of the nomenclatural rules, which require a clear description and the designation of a type specimen. Goward published it formally a year later in 1995, as part of a synopsis of Peltigera occurring in British Columbia. The species epithet refers to the cinnamon-coloured veins on the thallus underside. Goward called it the \"dog pelt\" in a previous publication before it was officially named. It has also been referred to as the \"cinnamon-pelt lichen\".\nEarly molecular phylogenetics studies of taxa within the Peltigera canina species complex delineated two major monophyletic groups, each with distinct ecological preferences. The two groups are known as CICADE and PORUDI. The acronym CICADE stands for \"Cinnamomea, Canina, Degelii, and their close relatives\", encompassing species that are primarily mesophytic to subhygrophytic. While these species typically occupy humid, woodland habitats, they can also be found in drier locations. Peltigera cinnamomea is a part of the CICADE group, reflecting its preference for environments that maintain moderate to high humidity. This categorisation is supported by genetic data that confirms its close relationship with other species in this group.\nDescription\nThe thallus underside shows the cinnamon-coloured veins for which the lichen is named.\nPeltigera cinnamomea is characterised by its foliose, loosely attached thallus, which typically spans 10\u201330\u00a0cm (4\u201312\u00a0in) in diameter. The structure of the thallus facilitates various ecological functions. The lobes of this lichen are somewhat leathery and stiff, measuring approximately 1 to 3\u00a0cm (0.4 to 1.2\u00a0in) in width, elongating and loosely overlapping with irregular branches. The tips of the lobes are rounded and may either lie flat or curve downwards, with generally smooth margins. The upper surface varies in colour from pale bluish-grey to pale brownish-grey, and may be tinged with shades of cinnamon brown. This surface is dull, often billowed broadly, and covered with a tomentum\u2014a short, soft, dense growth of hairs\u2014that tends to fade near the thallus centre.\nMoving to the underside of the thallus, the lichen lacks soredia (granular reproductive structures) and isidia (outgrowths containing both the algae and the fungus of the lichen), indicative of its specific reproductive and structural characteristics. The margins are devoid of small lobules. The lower surface features pale tan veins that darken to rusty brown or cinnamon brown towards the centre. These veins are narrow, occasionally raised, and smooth (glabrous), while the areas between them (interstices) are whitish and moderately deep. The rhizines, root-like structures, match the colour of the veins and range from simple to intricately branched (penicillate), enhancing the lichen's att",

    "The Kashiwa Campus, University of Tokyo (Japanese: \u6771\u4eac\u5927\u5b66 \u67cf\u5730\u533a\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9, branded as UTokyo Kashiwa) is one of the three main campuses of the University of Tokyo located in Kashiwa, Chiba. It is also referred to as the \"Kashiwa Campus\" or simply \"Kashiwa District\". It consists of three subareas divided by parks and roads: Kashiwa, Kashiwa II, and Kashiwanoha Station Front.\nOverview\nUntil the 1990s, the University of Tokyo operated campuses dispersed across various locations such as Nakano, Shirokanedai, and Mitaka (later spun off from the university as the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan), as well as Roppongi (Institute for Solid State Physics, Institute of Industrial Science) and Tanashi (Institute for Nuclear Study, Institute for Cosmic Ray Research), in addition to the central Tokyo main campuses of Hongo and Komaba. These smaller campuses were acquired at different stages throughout the university's history. It was often pointed out that having smaller campuses spread across Tokyo caused various inconveniences. Hence, it was decided to purchase a hundred acres of suburban land near the newly opened Tsukuba Express line to concentrate institutes and departments that need large research facilities. UTokyo Kashiwa was established based on the tri-polar structure concept (\u4e09\u6975\u69cb\u9020\u69cb\u60f3), which was formulated in conjunction with the redevelopment of the Hongo and Komaba campuses, which had become too small for new buildings needed to keep up with the latest developments in science and technology.\nUSAF Kashiwa Communications Station in 1966\nFrom 1945 to 1979, the site of the campus was occupied by the Kashiwa Communications Station of the United States Air Force (Camp Tomlinson). After the closure of the station, the site remained unoccupied until the university purchased it in 1995 and 1998.\nAs of May 2023, 1,969 postgraduate students, 819 faculty members and researchers and 831 other members of staff were based at UTokyo Kashiwa. Very few undergraduates are based at UTokyo Kashiwa, as it is dedicated to advanced research and postgraduate education. UTokyo Kashiwa also has international dormitories, reflecting its high concentration of international students.\nFaculties and institutes\nUTokyo Kashiwa has the following faculties and institutes:\nFaculties and Departments:\nSome departments from the School of Science\nSome departments from the School of Engineering\nSome departments from the Department of New Interdisciplinary Science, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences\nAffiliated Institutes:\nKavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe\nInstitute for Cosmic Ray Research\nInstitute for Solid State Physics\nInstitute of Atmospheric and Oceanic Research\nChiba Experimental Station, Institute of Industrial Science\nCentre for Artificial Intelligence Research\nCentre for Spatial Information Science\nEnvironmental Safety Research Centre (Kashiwa Branch)\nHealth Centre (Kashiwa Branch)\nKashiwa Library\nKashiwa Area Administration Office\nAccess\n13 minutes by University Commuter Bus from Kashiwanoha-campus Station (TX13) on the Tsukuba Express\n30 minutes by walk from Edogawadai Station (TD20) on the Tobu Noda line\n1 hour 15 minutes by the Gorokuro Liner (shuttle bus service between the main Hongo Campus and the Kashiwa Campus)\nNeighbourhood\nKashiwanoha Park\nNational Cancer Center Japan, Hospital East\nKashiwanoha Campus, Chiba University\nRugby School Japan\nLaLaport KASHIWANOHA (\u3089\u3089\u307d\u30fc\u3068\u67cf\u306e\u8449)\nGallery\nMap of the campus\nBuilding of the Graduate School of Frontier Sciences\nOutdoor atrium of the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research\nFront gate of the Kashiwa II Campus\nStation Satellite\nEngineering buildings\nInternational dormitory for students\nEngineering buildings\nTest railway track\nFormer Tokyo Metro series 01 train used as a railway technology testbed\n",

    "\nDir campaign refers to a conflict that took place in Dir state, originally an insurrection by locals against the rule of Nawab Jahan Khan that lead to the death of 200 soldiers of Nawab and unknown number of locals. This insurrection antagonized Pakistani government and it tried to negotiate the resignation of Nawab but no settlement was reached. This was followed by an invasion of the state by Pakistani SSG and overthrow of Nawab. It was the first deployment of SSG in a conflict.\nBackground\nOn 8 Feb 1948, Dir acceded to the newly created Muslim dominion of Pakistan, initially continuing as one of the surviving princely states of Pakistan. \nThe politics of the late Nawabs are described as reactionary and harsh.\nState violence and underdevelopment\nIt was reported by Fosco Maraini in 1959 during an expedition towards Hindu-Kush, reported the opinion of the people that the Nawab Jahan Khan (who was about 64 years old at that time) was a tyrannical leader, denying his subjects any freedom of speech and instruction, governing the land with a number of henchmen, and seizing for his harem any girl or woman he wanted. Maraini also noticed the lack of schools, sewers, and paved roads, and the presence of just a rudimentary newly built hospital. The Nawab was negatively compared to the Wali of Swat, whose liberal politics allowed his state to enter into the modern era.\nCivilian uprising\nAs a consequence, uprisings began eventually to explode. A repressed revolt in 1959 was  reported by Maraini's. Another insurrection in 1960 led to the death of 200 soldiers and put the Nawab in a bad light in the view of the press. Pakistani government put heavy pressure on the Nawab Jahan Khan to resign but no diplomatic success was reached.\nAfghan infiltration\nIn September 1960, Afghan tribesmen and some regular troops under civilian cover entered the area of Dir as part of the wider Bajaur Campaign to help Nawab Jahan khan against the Pakistan -backed opposition. The Afghan lashkars were forced to withdraw and this proved to be the casus belli for the Pakistani government to launch the operation for the overthrow of Nawab.\nPakistan military operation\nIn October 1960, Two companies of the SSG covertly in Scouts uniform launched an operation to overthrow the Nawab Jahan Khan and his son Khan of Jandool.\nFirst SSG company operated from Chitral under the command of Mirza Aslam Beg Commanded SSG alongside Shariff  Force commanded by Brig M. Shariff. They launched an assault on the town of Dir with the aim of overthinking Nawab Jahan Khan. Maj. Nishat Ahmed, Capt. S.M. Naeem and Lt. Fakhre Alam also participated in this operation. The overthrow was bloodless.\nThe  second SSG company, commanded by Maj. Aslam Beg, operated in the area of Munda Killa alongside Rakhman Gul Force . It's aim was to capture Khan of Jandool. Lt Col. A O Mitha were part of this company. They transported the Nawab and his son in to Risalpur via air.\nAll the weapons of nawab were confiscated and constitutional government was established. Nawab shah Khesrao khan was recognised as the Nawab of Dir. The SSG personnel remained in the area for a month.\nExile of Nawab\nGeneral Yahya decided to exile Jahan Khan, who would die in 1968. His throne passed in October 1961 to his eldest son, Mohammad Shah Khosru Khan, educated in India and a serving Major General of the Pakistan Army. However, the effective rule of Dir was taken by the Pakistani government's Political Agent.\nAftermath\nA few years later, on 28 July 1969, the Dir state was incorporated into Pakistan, ceasing its political existence. The royal status of the Nawabs was abolished in 1972, at the same time as most other princes of Pakistan.\n\n",
    "\nMorris Alexander (1877\u00a0\u2013 1946) was a South African Jewish politician. Morris was born in 1877 in Znin, Poland to a German Jewish family. He moved to Cape Town in 1904. He founded the Jewish Board of Deputies for the Cape Colony in that same year. Morris was educated at St. John's College in Cambridge. He married a woman named Ruth Schechter in June 1907. They had three children but divorced in 1935. He later remarried, to Enid Asenath Baumberg. He was a member of the Cape of Good Hope Parliament from 1908 to 1910 and later a member of the Union of South Africa Parliament from 1910 until his death in 1946.\nPersonal life\nBorn to a German Jewish family in 1877, Morris moved to South Africa in 1904 at the age of 17. He would be educated at St. Johns University. Morris Alexander was married to Ruth Shechter, the daughter of Solomon Shechter in June 1907. They had two sons and one daughter before they divorced in 1935. He then remarried a woman named Enid Asenath Baumberg.\nPolitical career\nMorris first got into politics in 1904 when he founded the Cape Jewish Board of Deputies which dealt with issues of Jewish immigration to the Cape of Good Hope. From 1908 to 1910 Morris was elected to the Cape of Good Hope Parliament. \nDuring this time he led a campaign to have Yiddish reclassified from a Semitic language to a European one allowing Yiddish speakers to emigrate to South Africa without being stopped on the grounds of race. Prior to this many Jewish immigrants to South Africa were rejected on racial grounds. During this time he and his wife both became staunch supporters of Gandhi as they both were united over their support for Yiddish speakers.\nHe later suggested that a chief officer of Jewish immigration be appointed and on January 1, 1914, Mr. B.S. Hersch was appointed to that role. This was significant as after World War I many Jews immigrated to South Africa. In his later career he worked for the interests of the country's racial minorities, joined the South African Party and became a devotee of the ideas of Jan Smuts, and became a significant Jewish community leader.\n",

    "Raynald of Saint-Val\u00e9ry (died after 1165), also known as Renaud, was Lord of Harenc\u2014a fiefdom in the Principality of Antioch\u2014from 1158 to 1163.\nLife\nRaynald was the son of Bernard II of Saint-Val\u00e9ry and his wife Matilda. In 1097, Raynald's father is mentioned with his father, Walter of Saint-Val\u00e9ry, during the conquest of Nicaea in the First Crusade.\nAround 1157/1158, Raynald is witnessed as a knight in the retinue of Thierry, Count of Flanders. He went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land and there they took part in a military campaign against the Syrian Muslims under the leadership of Baldwin III, King of Jerusalem, in the summer of 1157. The crusaders took advantage of Nur al-Din Zengi\u2019s illness to expand the Principality of Antioch. Certainly, Thierry had in mind to hold of the conquered lands. First, they besieged the fortress of Shaizar, which Thierry should have received as a fief.\nRaynald of Ch\u00e2tillon, Prince of Antioch, demanded that the new rulers should turned them into his vassals. However, Raynald only had seized the princely throne through his marriage with Constance, Princess of Antioch, the actual Antioch\u2019s ruler, and he was a minor noble unlike Thierry, who was a high noble in France. So that, Thierry refused to make him homage as his feudal lord. Although the crusaders had taken Shaizar\u2019s Lower Town and the Citadel was on the point of surrendering, they lifted the siege in October 1157 and the crusader army continued his march to the north.\nAfter the army had occupied the ruins of Apamea, they sieged the castle of Harenc. Harenc had belonged to the Principality of Antioch, but it was conquest by Nur al-Din\u2019s forces in 1149. The crusader army conquered Harenc on February 1158. Since Thierry still refusing to make homage to Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon, the Harenc\u2019s castle and his surrounding domains were granted to Raynald of Saint-Val\u00e9ry. As new Lord of Harenc, Raynald was engaged in another Baldwin III\u2019s campaign, where he distinguished in Nur al-Din\u2019s defeat, who had invaded Galilee.\nThe castle of Harenc was disputed during the next decade. On 12 August 1164, a Christian army was defeated by Nur al-Din during the battle of Harim, which was sent to relieve Harenc. Apparently, Raynald had already departed to England to that time y he sold his rights about Harenc to Joscelin III, Titular Count of Edessa, who is mentioned as Lord of Harenc around 1163. Raynald, probably had one daughter called Orguilleuse, who married with Bohemond III, Prince of Antioch and she was known as \u201cLord of Harenc\u2019s daughter\u201d.\n",
    "\nNGC 3509 known as Arp 335, is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Leo. It is located 340 million light-years from the Solar System. NGC 3509 was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on December 30, 1786.\nCharacteristics\nNGC 3509 by DECam\nNGC 3509 is a large galaxy. With a diameter of 215,000 light-years, it is much bigger than the Milky Way, which only has a diameter of at least 100,000 light-years. Its luminosity class is II-III and it has a broad HII region.\nHubble Space Telescope image of NGC 3509\nAdditionally, NGC 3509 is a peculiar galaxy showing an interesting detail. It has a sweeping tidal tail feature, which seems to offer hints of evolution and makes the galaxy resemble a tadpole. A further study proves that this is not the case since NGC 3509 has a single undisturbed nucleus which is surrounded by dust lanes. This means it has not undergone a major disk-to-disk merger and instead had a minor merger with a smaller satellite galaxy. As the galaxy interaction between NGC 3509 and the galaxy occurs, certain starbursts are triggered  in regions along its spiral arms which causes it to actively create new stars.\nAnother study proves that a galactic halo is growing in NGC 3509 through accretion of smaller galaxies, in which they leave a spur behind as they are tidally disrupted by their host galaxy.\nNGC 3509 is designated as Arp 335 in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies by Halton Arp, in which it is placed into the Miscellaneous category, M82 being the well-known galaxy in this classification.\nSupernova\nOne supernova has been discovered in NGC 3509: SN 2010bi.\nSN 2010bi\nSN 2010bi was discovered on March 24, 2010, by G. Piginata and M. Cifuentes along with other astronomers from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on the behalf of the CHASE project (CHilean Automatic Supernova sEarch). SN 2010bi was found via an unfiltered image taken using the 0.41-m 'PROMPT 5' telescope located at Cerro Tololo. It was located 28\".4 east and 34\".6 north of the nucleus. The supernova was Type IIP in which its progenitor might be a 8-16 solar mass red supergiant.\n",
    "Constituency in Seoul, South Korea\nDobong B (Korean:\u00a0\ub3c4\ubd09\uad6c \uc744) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Dobong District, Seoul. As of 2024, 136,197 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1996 after being reorganized from the former Dobong B and Dobong C constituencies.\nHistory\nSince its establishment, Dobong B has more often voted for centre-left, liberal parties to represent the constituency and is thus considered a stronghold for the Democratic Party.\nSul Hoon of the centrist-liberal National Congress for New Politics was the first member to represent the constituency, having narrowly beat out Paik Young-ki of the centre-right Grand National Party. Sul won re-election in 2000, once again defeating Paik. However, Sul did not run for re-election in 2004 after being indicted on falsely claiming that then presidential candidate Lee Hoi-chang had received $200,000 from businessman Choi Kyu-sun. Sul was succeeded by Yoo Ihn-tae of the liberal Uri Party, receiving 47.37% of the vote. Yoo unsuccessfully ran for re-election in 2008 and was defeated by Kim Seon-dong of the Grand National Party. A return match between Yoo and Kim was held in 2012 which saw Yoo win back the seat. Ahead of the 2016 South Korean legislative election, the Democratic Party \"cut-off\" Yoo from re-nomination, instead nominating lawyer Oh Gi-hyoung for the constituency. Kim Seon-dong of the conservative Saenuri Party emerged victorious in a three-way race which saw vote splitting between the Democratic Party and the newly formed centrist People Party. In the following election, Oh Gi-hyoung defeated Kim by a margin of more than seven points, winning back the seat for Democratic Party. Oh won re-election in 2024, garnering 52.83% of the vote and defeated People Power Party challenger Kim Seon-dong in a one-on-one match.\nBoundaries\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Ssangmun 2-dong, Ssangmun 4-dong, Banghak-dong, and Dobong-dong. The constituency borders Uijeongbu A to the north, Dongducheon\u2013Yangju\u2013Yeoncheon A to the northwest, Gangbuk A to the west, Dobong A to the south, and Nowon B to the east.\nList of members of the National Assembly\nElection results\n2024\n2020\n2016\n2012\n2008\n2004\n2000\n1996\nSee also\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n",

The holotype is housed at the Allan Herbarium of Manaaki Whenua \u2013 Landcare Research.\nOurisia remotifolia is morphologically similar to other New Zealand small-leaved species, namely O. sessilifolia, with which it shares irregular white corollas that are purple inside with lines of white hairs, and having a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs on many plant parts.\nO. remotifolia can be distinguished from O. sessilifolia by its lax, semi-erect, non-rosette habit (vs. erect rosette habit), leaves with long petioles that are widely spaced along the stem (vs. tightly packed rosettes), irregular calyces (vs. regular), flowers and bracts in pairs only (vs. sometimes in whorls), and all hairs the same length (vs. glandular hairs much shorter than non-glandular hairs).\nDescription\nClose-up of flowers showing white corollas with purple inside the corolla tube, and mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs on the calyx and pedicels\nOurisia remotifolia plants are perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, with opposite leaves that are tightly packed to tufted near the tip of the stem. Leaf petioles are 2.6\u201318.5\u00a0mm long. Leaf blades are 6.9\u201324.0\u00a0mm long by 6.9\u201320.3\u00a0mm wide (length: width ratio 1.0\u20131.2: 1), broadly to very broadly ovate, widest below the middle, with a rounded apex, usually cuneate base and regularly crenate edges. Leaves are densely hairy with a mixture of long glandular and non-glandular hairs on the upper surface, and densely hairy with short to long glandular hairs on the lower surface especially on the veins (sometimes glabrous), with prominent veins on the lower surface and sometimes punctate. Inflorescences are erect, densely hairy racemes up to 190\u00a0mm long, with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs, and with 1\u20134 flowering nodes and up to 6 total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node has 1\u20132 flowers and 2 sessile, sometimes clasping bracts that are narrowly obovate or oblanceolate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves, 9.5\u201317.6\u00a0mm long and 5.3\u20139.1\u00a0mm wide, and become smaller toward the apex of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a densely hairy pedicel that is up to 21\u00a0mm long and has glandular hairs. The calyx is 5.7\u20137.7\u00a0mm long, irregular, with 3 lobes divided to one-quarter to one-half the length of the calyx and 2 divided to near the base, and densely hairy with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. The corolla is 12.5\u201317.7mm long (including the 4.6\u20138.1mm long corolla tube), bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous and white on the outside, and purple with 3 lines of white hairs on the inside. The corolla lobes are 3.6\u20139.2\u00a0mm long, spreading, and usually obcordate to obovate. There are 4 stamens up to 7.0\u00a0mm long which are didynamous, with two long stamens reaching the corolla tube opening or exserted, and 2 short stamens included inside the corolla; a short staminode 0.5\u20130.7\u00a0mm long is also present. The style is 3.0\u20134.9\u00a0mm long, exserted, with an emarginate stigma. The ovary is 2.2\u20133.1\u00a0mm long and glabrous. Fruits are capsules 3.9\u20136.5\u00a0mm long and 3.3\u20136.2\u00a0mm wide with loculicidal dehiscence and pedicels up to 27.0\u00a0mm long. The number of seeds in each capsule is unknown, and seeds are 0.7\u20131.1\u00a0mm long and 0.3\u20130.6\u00a0mm long, with a two-layered, reticulate seed coat.\nOurisia remotifolia flowers from December to January and fruits from January to April.\nHabit and rocky alpine herbfield habitat of O. remotifolia\nThe chromosome number of Ourisia remotifolia is 2n=48.\nDistribution and habitat\nOurisia remotifolia is a New Zealand mountain foxglove that is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand.  It is found only in the regions of Canterbury, Westland and Fiordland in high-elevation herbfields on bluffs, in sheltered hollows, or in rock crevices, and can be locally common, from 1000 to 2200 m above sea level.\nPhylogeny\nAn individual of O. remotifolia was included in phylogenetic analyses of all species of the genus Ourisia using standard DNA sequencing markers (two nuclear ribosomal DNA markers a",
    "\nThe Battle of Giedrai\u010diai (Lithuanian: Giedrai\u010di\u0173 m\u016b\u0161is) was fought on November 17\u201321, 1920, between the Lithuanian Army and a part of the Polish Army led by Lucjan \u017beligowski, which called itself the Army of Central Lithuania.\nPrelude\nOn October 9, 1920, General Lucjan \u017beligowski's forces occupied Vilnius as part of his false-flag mutiny. His forces mainly consisted of the 1st Lithuanian\u2013Belarusian Infantry Division and the 13th Vilnius Uhlan Regiment. The Polish forces did not stop their attack after occupying Vilnius and instead attacked towards the west and north-west. They reached R\u016bdi\u0161k\u0117s on October 10, and then Nemen\u010din\u0117 on October 11.\nThe Poles continued their offensive on both sides of the Neris river on October 13. This Polish attack pushed back the 3rd Infantry Division under Ignas Musteikis\u00a0 from the Vok\u0117\u2013Lentvaris line to Semeli\u0161k\u0117s\u2013Rykantai line. On 14\u201315 October, the 3rd Division stopped \u017beligowski's attack in the western direction on the left bank of the Neris river at the line of Vievis\u2013Valkininkai.\nThe Polish attack on the right bank of the Neris (in the north-west direction) was stronger and the 1st Infantry Division (2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th Infantry Regiments) under Stasys Nastopka retreated fighting. The positions at Papi\u0161k\u0117s\u00a0, Gele\u017eiai\u00a0, Buki\u0161k\u0117s\u00a0 and Bajorai had to be abandoned and the 1st Division retreated to the \u0160il\u0117nai-\u017dalesa\u00a0 line. The Poles occupied the towns of\u0160ven\u010dion\u0117liai, \u0160irvintos, Giedrai\u010diai.\nOn October 21, the 13th Uhlans invaded the Lithuanian rear and captured the 1st Infantry Division's headquarters.\nBy 27 October, \u017beligowski's army had occupied \u017delva and Vidi\u0161kiai and threatened to cut the Ukmerg\u0117-Utena road.\nThe 1st Infantry Division (now composed of the 2nd, 7th and 9th Infantry Regiments and commanded by Edvardas Adamkavi\u010dius) counterattacked and retook \u017delva, and liberated Giedrai\u010diai on November 1. The front stopped at the Kernav\u0117\u2013Musninkai\u2013\u0160irvintos\u2013Giedrai\u010diai\u2013Dubingiai\u2013\u0160ven\u010dion\u0117liai line. The front briefly stabilized.\nThe League of Nations decided to resolve the Polish\u2013Lithuanian War over the Vilnius Region by plebiscite. Thus, it sent the League's Military Control Commission to the conflict zone. \u017beligowski was forced to hurry because his soldier's combativeness gradually weakened and he still sought to seize more Lithuanian territory.\nBattle\nNovember 17: Polish offensive begins\nIn the early morning of November 17, the Poles launched a new offensive on the 30 km section of the \u0160irvintos\u2013Giedrai\u010diai\u2013Dubingiai front. Two infantry brigades, supported by artillery, attacked towards \u0160irvintos and Giedrai\u010diai, and a cavalry brigade of eleven squadrons broke through to the rear of the Lithuanian army at the Dubingiai gorge in the direction of Videni\u0161kiai\u2013Kurkliai.\nMonument to Lithuanian soldiers at Giedrai\u010diai\nThe 2nd Infantry Regiment defending Giedrai\u010diai was hit the hardest. To avoid encirclement, on the evening of November 17, the regiment retreated to the \u017delva-Balninkai line. The 7th Infantry Regiment, defending \u0160irvintos, retreated to positions in the Viesos\u00a0\u2013Li\u016bnai\u00a0\u2013Degu\u010diai\u00a0 section after fierce fighting. The 4th Infantry Regiment, which defended the Musninkai front, remained unmoved from its positions. The Polish cavalry, having crossed \u0160ventoji near Kavarskas, pushed deep into Lithuania and reached the vicinity of K\u0117dainiai. The Lithuanian army was threatened with encirclement.\nEdvardas Adamkavi\u010dius, commanding the 1st Division, approved the plan put forth by the meeting of the 7th Infantry Regiment's officers. The plan to bypass \u0160irvintos and attack the Poles from the flank and rear was originally proposed by Teodoras Balnas, the commander of the 7th Regiment's 3rd Battalion.\nNovember 18: Polish debacle due to Lithuanian attack\nOn the evening of November 18, Balnas formed a group of 170-200 soldiers, which he led in a 14 kilometres (8.7\u00a0mi) march through the forest at night. The group attacked the battalion of the Polish Grodno Regiment\u00a0 stationed near the village of Motiej\u016bnai\u00a0. During the battle, the Grodno regiment's commander Seweryn Rymaszewski\u00a0 was killed. The headquarters of the Polish 2nd Lithuanian\u2013Belarusian Brigade\u00a0 and the Grodno regiment were captured, totalling about 200 prisoners. The Lithuanians conquered many war trophies, which included two cannons, nine mortars, twenty machine guns, and many wagons. The Grodno regiment's remaining two battalions were scattered by Lithuanian forces in the vicinity of \u0160irvintos. After regrouping, the Poles soon occupied \u0160irvintos again.\nNovember 19\u201321: Lithuanian counter-offensive\nOn the morning of November 19, the Lithuanian army commander General Silvestras \u017dukauskas arrived in Ukmerg\u0117 and organized a counterattack with the entire front. The 2nd Infantry Regiment, which retreated to the vicinity of Lyduokiai, was reinforced, and the 8th Infantry Regiment was added to the Lithuanian forces at the front. The Lithuanian army started the attack in the night from November 20 to 21. \u0160irvintos was again surro",
    "Chinese laser company\nHan's Laser (Chinese: \u5927\u65cf\u6fc0\u5149; pinyin: D\u00e0z\u00fa J\u012bgu\u0101ng) is a publicly listed Chinese company that engages in the manufacture and sale of industrial laser equipment. It is one of the largest laser companies in China.\nBackground\nIn 1996, Han's Laser was founded in Shenzhen by Gao Yunfeng who previously taught at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The idea came after Gao helped to repair a foreign industrial machine for a friend as at the time foreign firm's did not pay much attention to foreign markets and the repair process took a long time. Using CNY400,000 from his friend as payment for the repairs. Gao decided to rent a house in Shenzhen to start his business.\nThe location was chosen as it attracted a lot of young college graduates across the country that it could recruit for its research and development (R&D) unit.\nWhen Han's Laser first started, it provided services to button makers by printing logos on them.\nTo raise capital for the company, Gao had to give up his controlling stake of the company to investors such as Shenzhen HTI Group.\nIn 2000, Han's Laser hired Wang Daheng as a technology consultant to the company. The company hired other academics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences which contributed to the rise of its R&D strength.\nIn 2001, Gao had a conflict with Han's Laser's management team chosen by Shenzhen HTI Group. As a result, he went to loan sharks to borrow money to repurchase enough shares of the company to regain control. The company restructured as a result. During the same year, Han's Laser stated expanding into overseas markets.\nIn 2004, Han's Laser held its initial public offering and became a listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\nDue to the Made in China 2025 policy, there was a large demand for laser equipment which benefitted Han's Laser. Compared to its peers, Han's Laser product line covered a larger range of industries.\nIn November 2016, Han's Laser acquired CorActive High-Tech, a  manufacturer of specialty optical fiber and fiber laser modules based in Quebec, Canada.\nOn 5 March 2019, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange notified the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that shares of Han's Laser could no longer be purchased via the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect program as foreign ownership of the company had already exceeded the 28% threshold and was close to the 30% hard limit. At the time, this was only the second stock in the program's history to approach an upper limit for foreign ownership. MSCI which had previously included the company in its China All Shares Index removed it on 11 March citing potential investability issue for investors.\nIn May 2023, it was reported that Han's Laser had purchased 262 acres in Manor, Texas which was speculated to be a project to build a factory there that could grow to provide over 1,000 jobs in the area.\nControversies\nIn July 2019, Tiger Vision Financial Research released a report that questioned the authenticity of Han's Laser's European R&D center project in Switzerland. It claimed that the funds of CNY1.1\u00a0billion for it were embezzled to build a luxury hotel instead. In response, Han's Laser made a statement on East Money that stated the European R&D center was an independent project and that there were no misappropriation of funds. Shares of the company declined by 9.11% afterwards. A visit to the registered address of the  R&D center in Engelberg revealed it was only a room of about 10 square meters.\nIn August 2019, Gao was interviewed on a China Central Television program where he was asked about the embezzlement scandal. Gao lashed out at the reporter asking if the reporter was qualified to question him. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange criticized Gao's remarks. Shortly afterwards, Han's Laser issued a statement apologizing for Gao's remarks. Despite this, shares of Han's declined 8.8% on that day.\n",

The son-in-law of military ruler Ch\u014fng Chung-bu, he was killed when Ky\u014fng Tae-s\u016dng took control of the government from his father-in-law. \nBiography\nSong Yu-in was the son of a man who died defending Goryeo during the reign of King Injong. Due to his father's death on behalf of the nation, Song Yu-in was granted the rank of executive captain (\uc0b0\uc6d0; \u6563\u54e1; sanw\u014fn) via protected appointment. Song rose through the ranks to become tae'ja pujiyu (\ud0dc\uc790\ubd80\uc9c0\uc720; \u592a\u5b50\u5e9c\u6307\u8aed) then general of the guards (\uc704\uc7a5\uad70; \u885b\u5c07\u8ecd; wi changgun). He married the ex-wife of a Song dynasty merchant. Despite being from the lowly cheonmin class, Song's wife was wealthy. Song was able to use his wealthy wife's money to bribe the eunuchs and obtained a government post. By the 1170 military coup, Song had achieved the rank of grand general (\ub300\uc7a5\uad70; \u5927\u5c07\u8ecd; daejanggun).\nDue to Song's connections to the civilian officials, Song was disliked by the other military officials who despised the civilian officials for their treatment of the Goryeo military. After the 1170 Goryeo military coup, Song abandoned his wife and married the daughter of Ch\u014fng Chung-bu, one of the ringleaders of the coup, in order to avoid persecution. Song would be appointed the military commissioner (\ubcd1\ub9c8\uc0ac; \u5175\u99ac\u4f7f; py\u014fngmasa) of Seobukmyeon. However, when he was unable to deal with local revolts, he feigned illness and resigned as commissioner, and was replaced by General U Hak-yu (\uc6b0\ud559\uc720; \u4e8e\u5b78\u5112).\nOn January 23, 1175, Song Yu-in was appointed as vice commissioner of the Security Council (\ucd94\ubc00\uc6d0\ubd80\uc0ac; \u6a1e\u5bc6\u9662\u526f\u4f7f; ch'umilw\u014fnpusa) and the minister of war (\ubcd1\ubd80\uc0c1\uc11c; \u5175\u90e8\u5c19\u66f8; py\u014fngbu sangs\u014f).

Song was also given permission from King Myeongjong to use Suchang Palace as Song's own residence. In 1179, he impeached Confucian scholar-officials Mun K\u016dk-ky\u014fm and Han Mun-jun, demoting them from their positions at the Security Council. On October 18, Song and his father-in-law were killed by Ky\u014fng Tae-s\u016dng who opposed the rule of Ch\u014fng  and his family.\nNotes\n^ In the Korean calendar (lunar), he died on the 16th day of the 9th Lunar month of the 9th year of Myeongjong's reign.\n",

    "British journalist\nShaun Walker (born 1981/82) is a British journalist noted for his writing on Ukraine, and Russia. Walker visited Russia for the first time as an 18-year-old, in 2000, working as an English teacher, and then travelling around the country. Walker then returned to the UK, where he studied Russian and  Soviet history at Oxford University. After completing his studies, Walker returned to Moscow at the end of 2003, working for an NGO for a year, before taking up journalism. Walker was the Moscow correspondent for The Independent from 2007 to 2013. From 2014 to 2018, Walker was The Guardian's correspondent for Russia and Ukraine.\nIn his time working for the Independent and Guardian, Walker frequently expressed his support for Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny. Working for the Guardian, Walker has extensively covered the war in Donbas.  Walker wrote a downbeat 'farewell' article to Russia in early 2018, stating that he would return for the upcoming World Cup, but after that he was 'off for real', expressing his desire to return to see a 'post- Putin' Russia. Walker did return for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, this time writing an upbeat article about the \"positive atmosphere: the street parties, the surprisingly lax police presence, the good-natured welcome from the majority of Russians, and the hot weather and cheap beer.\"\nFrom 2019, Walker has been the Guardian's central and eastern Europe correspondent. He has received praise for his writing on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Walker has also been criticised for some his pro-Russian writings prior to 2022, including a 2014 article for the Guardian entitled \"I can't stop dreaming about Vladimir Putin\", and his positive comments on Russia at the time of the 2018 World Cup. Walker was shortlisted for the 2024 UK Press Awards.\nWalker is the author of two non-fiction books, 2014's Odessa Dreams: The Dark Heart of Ukraine's Online Marriage Industry, and 2018's The Long Hangover: Putin's New Russia and the Ghosts of the Past.\nWalker currently lives in Budapest, Hungary.

It is currently led by Bader Jamous.\nIn December 2015, various Syrian opposition forces convened Riyadh I Conference in Saudi Arabia. It was attended by around 150 opposition figures and the formation of the Syrian Negotiation Commission (at the time named High Negotiation Commission) was declared at the end of the conference.\nIn December 2015, the Security Council issued resolution no. 2254 which provided for launching formal negotiations between representatives of the Syrian opposition and of the regime in order to reach a durable political settlement and establish a credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governing body, adopting a pathway for the drafting of a new constitution for Syria and holding free elections under UN auspices.

It held that a political solution must be based on Geneva Communique\nand UNSCRs 2118 and 2254  which provide for the establishment of a transitional governing body with full executive powers.\nThe SNC then took part in the UN-sponsored Geneva III and Geneva IV negotiations. The SNC also sent an advisory delegation to Astana I negotiations which were held under the auspices of Russia and T\u00fcrkiye as guarantors.\nIn February 2017, the fourth round of Geneva negotiations were held and the UN Special Envoy to Syria presented four baskets to negotiate, namely:\n\u00a0Establishment of credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance\n\u00a0Drafting a new constitution\n\u00a0Holding free and fair elections pursuant to a new constitution\nCounter terrorism.\nIn November 2017, the SNC held Riyadh II Conference  in which it discussed expanding the SNC to broaden representation and involve more national figures in the SNC particularly from inside Syria and increasing women representation.\nThe SNC asserted that its mandate was to negotiate with the regime to realize a democratic political transition through the establishment of a transitional governing body capable of preparing a safe and neutral environment within which the transitional process proceeds in accordance with international resolutions.\nIn September 2019, the UN Secretary General announced the establishment of the Syrian Constitutional Committee. The Large Body of the Constitutional Committee comprised 150 members divided equally on the three parties: the SNC, the Syrian regime and civil society.\nGeneva II\nMain article: Geneva II Conference on Syria\nGeneva II Conference for Peace in Syria (or simply Geneva II) was a UN-backed international conference held in Geneva with the aim of ending the conflict in Syria, by bringing together the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition.\nGeneva III\nMain article: Geneva Peace Talks on Syria (2016)\nSyrian peace talks in Geneva, also known as Geneva III, were peace negotiations between the Syrian government and opposition in Geneva under the auspices of the UN and the Vienna peace talks group on Syria and the UN Security Council.\nGeneva IV\nMain article: Geneva Peace Talks on Syria (2017)\nThe Geneva IV peace talks on Syria were peace negotiations between the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition under the auspices of the United Nations.\nGeneva VIII\nThe last round of Geneva talks, also known as Geneva VIII, was held in November 2017 and was concluded on 15 December when then UN Special Envoy to Syria, Staffan De Mistura, declared that \u201cnegotiations, in reality, in the end, did not take place\u201d\n",

He graduated from Point Loma High School in San Diego and briefly attended the University of California, Los Angeles before enlisting in the United States Marine Corps at the start of World War II. He was sworn into the Marines by his father, Roscoe Arnett, who was the officer in charge of Marine recruiting in Southern California. Arnett served with the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific and received a field commission in the South Pacific.

    "\nLilian Seenoi-Barr (born October 1981) is a Kenyan-born Northern Irish politician and councillor for Derry City and Strabane District Council, where she represents the Social Democratic and Labour Party. On 29 April 2024, Seenoi-Barr made history after being selected as the next First Citizen of Derry City and Strabane, and consequently as Northern Ireland's first black mayor.\nEarly life and career\nBorn in Narok, Kenya, Seenoi-Barr was initially raised in the village of Ol Ombokishi with her five sisters and eight brothers, and attended the village school until primary stage four. She then went to a school in Narok, where her mother ran a supermarket, and after secondary school attended university, where she studied women's reproductive health and community development. She became a prominent campaigner for gender rights among Massai women, focusing on forced marriage and female genital mutilation, but was forced to leave Kenya along with her son following threats to their safety because of her work with Maasai women. She first arrived in Northern Ireland as a refugee in 2010, after being invited to Derry by the Changaro Trust, which had helped to build schools in rural Kenya. The Changaro Trust subsequently helped Seenoi-Barr and her son to apply for refugee status. In 2012, she founded the North West Migrants Forum, and became its programme manager. She also helped to organise the Black Lives Matter protests that took place in Derry's Guildhall Square in June 2020.\nPolitical career\nA member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, who previously served as chair of its Derry City and Strabane branch, Seenoi-Barr first stood for election to Derry City and Strabane District Council's Foyleside ward in 2019, but was not successful despite polling well. In June 2021, she was co-opted onto the council following Councillor Mary Durkan's decision to step down from her role as councillor. She retained her Foyleside seat at the 2023 election, and in doing so became the first black person to be elected to public office in Northern Ireland.\nMayor of Derry and Strabane\nOn 29 April 2024, it was announced that Seemoi-Barr would become Northern Ireland's first black mayor after the Social Democratic and Labour Party appointed her as Derry and Strabane's First Citizen, succeeding Sinn F\u00e9in's Patricia Logue. She will become mayor at the Council's Annual General Meeting in June. Responding to the announcement, Seemoi-Barr said she was \"proud to be a Maasai woman and a Derry girl. I cannot express how much the honour of serving as mayor of Derry and Strabane means to me.\" Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and the Member of Parliament for Foyle, described Seenoi-Barr's appointment as \"a historic moment\" and said she \"will be an incredible mayor\".\nHowever, Seenoi-Barr's appointment attracted criticism from some within her party, who felt the way the decision was made was undemocratic. Jason Barr, serving as deputy mayor of Derry and Strabane at the time of Seenoi-Barr's appointment, resigned from the Social Democratic and Labour Party, saying he had been \"left in an untenable position due to the decisions made by the management committee\". The appointment prompted a second resignation from the party a few days later, when Shauna Cusack became an independent councillor. On 4 May, * 4 May, the Social Democratic and Labour Party announced it would make changes to the way it made \"civil leadership\" appointments following the resignations.\nNews of her appointment attracted online abuse from prominent far-right figures and conspiracy theorists, such as Alex Jones and David Icke. Jones claimed in a post on X that \"The WEF (World Economic Forum) is now installing invaders as mayors in Ireland just like in London\". In response to this, and other online abuse, Seenoi-Barr said she was \"aware\" of it but \"genuinely not interested\", while Michelle O'Neill, the First Minister of Northern Ireland, said those purporting the abuse \"do not speak for the wonderful and welcoming people of Derry and Strabane, and the work being done to build a better future for all\". On 5 May, a man was arrested by police in Derry after making online threats to Seenoi-Barr following the announcement of her selection as mayor.\nPersonal life\nSeenoi-Barr has a son who was born in Kenya and came to Northern Ireland with her. She met her husband after arriving in Northern Ireland. Her brother, Ledama Olekina, is a member of the Kenyan Senate representing the Narok area.\n",
    "Constituency in Seoul, South Korea\nNowon A (Korean:\u00a0\ub178\uc6d0\uad6c \uac11) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Nowon District, Seoul. As of 2024, 224,187 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Dobong constituency.\nHistory\nThroughout its history, Nowon A has displayed swing seat tendencies, having voted for both conservative and liberal political parties to represent the constituency in the National Assembly.\nBaek Nam-chi of the centre-right Reunification Democratic Party was the first member to represent the constituency. Baek narrowly won re-election in 1992 and 1996, having received 34.91% and 36.77% of the vote respectively. Ahead of the 2000 election, the Grand National Party did not renominate incumbent Baek Nam-chi as the party's candidate for Nowon A, having nominated former Minister of Energy and Resources Choe Dong-kyu instead. In response to this, Baek left the Grand National Party and joined the right-wing United Liberal Democrats on February 23, 2000. Baek unsuccessfully ran for re-election under the United Liberal Democrats banner, coming in third place. He was succeeded by Ham Seung-hee of the liberal Millennium Democratic Party. Ham was defeated in the following election by Chung Bong-ju of the liberal Uri Party. Chung unsuccessfully ran for re-election in 2008, being defeated by Hyun Gyoung-byoung of the conservative Grand National Party. However, Hyun lost his seat on June 10, 2011, having been found guilty of receiving \u20a930,000,000. A by-election for Nowon A was not held as South Korean election law does not allow for by-elections to held when less than one year is left until the next election.\nIn the 2012 South Korean legislative election, former Mayor of Nowon District Lee No-keun of the conservative Saenuri Party won the seat. Lee narrowly lost to Democratic Party challenger Koh Yong-jin in the following election, having lost by less than three points. A return match between Koh and Lee unfolded in the 2020 election, which saw Koh secure 56.78 and defeat Lee by more than eighteen points. Ahead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, Woo Won-shik was designated as the Democratic Party's candidate after defeating incumbent Koh Yong-jin in a party primary. The People Power Party nominated former assemblyman Hyun Gyoung-byoung. Woo went on to defeat Hyun in the general election, securing 58.99% of the vote.\nBoundaries\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Wolgye-dong, Gongneung-dong, and Junggye-dong.

During the 17th and 18th century, it was rebuilt in baroque style. It was a thriving school which included an impressive library. After the secularization, it became property of the prince of Hesse-Rothenburg and subsequently, the dukes of Ratibor and princes of Corvey, a branch of the Hohenlohe family. They made it their principal seat, which it remained up to the end of the Second World War. It was looted and set afire by the Red Army. The monastery church was immediately rebuilt, but the remaining buildings were only restored from the 1990s onwards. In 1998, it was transferred to the Diocese of Gliwice, and it has been an educational centre since, with the opportunity to stay the night over.\nHistory\nFront of the Rudy monastery\nRudy monastery at night\nMiddle Ages\nin 1258, Vladislaus I of Opole (1225-1281/2), Duke of Opole\u2013Racib\u00f3rz, founded a Cistercian monastery in Rudy. The duke granted the abbey many privileges and granted them large estates and villages as well. The first monks came from the J\u0119drzej\u00f3w Abbey in southern Poland. The first church was wooden. But the construction of a brick church started soon afterwards. It was completed around 1300 together with the eastern and western wings of the abbey. The church was consecrated in 1303.\nThe church of the monastery is dedicated to the Assumption of the blessed Virgin Mary. It is considered the oldest Marian shrine in Silesia. It attracted a lot of pilgrims, who wanted to see the image of the Virgin.\nCompared to other Cistercian monasteries, the income from the estate was not great although it had vineyards, and large forests and numerous streams around. The most important economic activity was related to the brewery, wine cellar and the distillery. Beer was brewed at least in the 14th and 15th centuries. From the start, the monastery was an educational centre as well.\nNames of abbots of these times have survived, like Peter I (1258\u20131274), Martin I (1456\u20131471) and Peter III (1471\u20131492).\nDuring the 15th and 16th century, the monastery was ravaged by war and looting due to the Hussite Wars, the Reformation and the Thirty Years War. Several times, the monastery was plundered. In 1625, there were only five monks left.\n17th and 18th century\nRudy monastery in the 18th century\nRudy monastery and church\nThe 17th and 18th century were the heyday of the monastery. The start of the new and better times are associated with abbot Andreas Emanuel Pospel and his successors. Between 1671 and 1680, abbot Pospel had the monastery and the church rebuilt in baroque style. A porch on the west side was erected in 1685. After a fire in 1724, the western fa\u00e7ade was completely redone, and between 1785 and 1790 the church interior was modernized.\nIn the 18th century, the school was thriving and a boarding school was added in 1744. The library of the monastery included 18,000 books and prints.\nIn 1810, the monastery was secularized and went into ownership of the Prussian state. The last abbot was Bernhard Galbiers. The boarding school closed in 1816. The library was divided among Silesian libraries and partly donated to waste paper.\nDukes of Ratibor and Princes of Corvey\nVictor Amadeus of Hessen-Rotenburg\nDuke Victor I with Rudy palace in the back\nRudy Palace by Alexander Duncker around 1860\nGarden front of Rudy palace in the first half of the 20th century\nEmperor Wilhelm II as guest of duke Victor II of Ratibor (left of the emperor)\nAfter the secularization, the monastery and its estates were handed over to the Prussian minister Wilhelm Ludwig Sayn-Wittgenstein (1770\u20131851). The monastery housed a military hospital for two years. In 1812, the monastery went into the hands of the crown prince of Hesse-Kassel, William II.\nIn 1820, Victor Amadeus, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg (1779\u20131834) became the new owner of the Rudy monastery and its estates. He started to transform the monastery into a princely residence. In both 1820 and 1822, he received in Rudy emperor Alexander I of Russia (1777\u20131825) as a guest.\nAlthough married twice, Victor Amadeus was childless and when he died in 1834, he bequeathed his possessions of the Silesian duchy of Ratibor (Czech: Ratibo\u0159, Polish: Racib\u00f3rz) and Prince of Corvey to his nephew, Victor, prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst (1818\u20131893). These estates amounted to around 34,000 hectares in size and consisted mostly of forests. Besides the Rudy monastery, it also included the Corvey.\nVictor was a member of the House of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst and eldest son of Franz Joseph, 1st Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst (1787",

He was the minister of state and the minister of interior in the coalition cabinets led by \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc in the early 1960s. He was also a journalist and poet.\nEarly life and education\nHe was born in Ankara, Ottoman Empire, on 17 March 1911. He completed his secondary education at Bursa High School in 1931. He graduated from the Faculty of Law at Ankara University in 1935. While attending the university he established a cultural and youth magazine entitled \u00c7\u0131\u011f\u0131r (Turkish: Epoch) in 1933 which he edited and published until its closure in 1948.\nCareer and activities\nAs of 1939 Bekata headed the language, history and literature branch of the People's Houses, a cultural organization. Then he worked at the Ministry of Economy and Trade in various posts. He became a member of the Republican People's Party in 1942 and was elected to the Parliament from Ankara in 1943. His tenure at the Parliament lasted until 1950. Then he worked as a freelance lawyer.\nBekata was again elected as a deputy in 1957 and served at the Parliament until 1960. Following the military coup on 27 May 1960 the rule of the Democrat Party ended, and a Constituent Assembly was formed. Bekata was made a member of the Assembly in 1961.\nBekata was appointed minister of state to the coalition cabinet formed by \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc in 1961. He was reappointed to the post on 25 June 1962. Then he was named as the minister of interior in the next cabinet again led by \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc on 17 October 1962, succeeding Sahir Kurto\u011flu in the post. Bekata had to resign from the post on 4 October 1963 due to his conflict with the minister of health, Yusuf Azizo\u011flu, a member of the New Turkey Party. The tension occurred when Bekata accused Azizo\u011flu of collaborating with the Kurdist leaders. Bekata was also acting minister of defense in the same cabinet and served as the government spokesman. Bekata's successor as minister of interior was \u0130lyas Se\u00e7kin.\nBekata was elected from Ankara as a senator in 1963 and held the post until 1975.

    "Not to be confused with T\u00fcrkmen-Karah\u00f6y\u00fck, an archaeological site in Konya Province, Turkey.\nKarah\u00fcy\u00fck (Elbistan) (also known as Karah\u00f6y\u00fck, Karahoyuk) is a village of Elbistan district of Kahramanmara\u015f province of Turkey. It is located 169 km to the north from Kahramanmara\u015f city and 9 km northwest from the Elbistan town.\nIn 1947, an important Anatolian hieroglyphic inscription stele was discovered near the village. This stele is believed to be from the 12th century BC.\nThe plain of Elbistan shares some history with Arslantepe (Melid). It is believed that Elbistan came under the control of Melid sometime around the 12th century BC. The Malatya group of the Neo-Hittite Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions have been studied by scholars. They come from the area of Karah\u00f6y\u00fck, and are believed to be very ancient.\nArchaeological excavations have also been conducted at Hamza Tepe, which is in the same area, 10 km northwest of Elbistan town, and to the west of Karah\u00f6y\u00fck. An ancient cremation cemetery from the Middle Iron Age (8th-7th centuries BC) has been discovered there.\nThe IZGIN hieroglyphic stele was also found in the area. It was found in 1882 in a cemetery near Izg\u0131n village. It was found actually standing among the monuments in that cemetery.\nSee also\nHittites\nMara\u015f lion\nKahramanmara\u015f Archaeology Museum\nNotes\n^ Karah\u00f6y\u00fck (Elbistan) Stele hittitemonuments.com\n^ Francesco Di Filippo, Lucia Mori (2019), The Malatya Plain in the Network of Interregional Relations. in The Late Bronze and Iron Ages.

    "For other uses, see Ochre (disambiguation).\nFor other uses, see Gold (disambiguation).\nGolden ochre powder\nGolden ochre, less often Gold Ochre (French: Ocre d\u2019or, German: Gold Ocker \u043e\u0442 Ancient Greek: \u1f60\u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 yellow-pale, orange or french ochre (obsolete)) \u2014 one of the most famous and brightly colored varieties of ochre \u2014 is a natural or (rarely) artificial pigment. In terms of mineral composition, golden ochre is clay with an admixture of aluminosilicates and a high content of the yellow dye itself, iron hydroxide, most often in the form of brown iron ore or limonite. The exact composition of ochre and its impurities vary greatly depending on the place of origin.\nGolden ochre is one of the oldest paints, known as a painting material since the times of cave paintings. In wall painting it is one of the main yellow pigments. Golden ochre has good density, the same covering power, high light fastness, pure color and soft structure. To this day it is used in all painting techniques without exception.\nDescription and properties\nThe golden ochre pigment is a natural mixture that consists primarily of crystalline iron oxide hydrate with some clay. The closest to golden ochre among related minerals is light ochre, which has a less warm and rich color. If in light ochre the content of the main dye, iron oxide hydrate, is quite low and ranges from 12 to 25%, then in golden ochre its amount can reach 70-75%. As a result, light ochre has a yellow color of a cooler tone and weaker color saturation and is considered a paint that is not bright and not intense. Golden ochre differs from it in its earthy tint and warmer tone.\nThree types of ochre\nYellow ochres are more common in nature than others due to the abundance of their constituent minerals. When heated, orange and yellow ochre release water and gradually darken, acquiring an increasingly reddish tint. This occurs due to the transformation of iron hydroxide into a dark red anhydrous oxide (iron ochre). With controlled calcination of yellow ochre, almost the entire range of shades can be obtained from yellow and orange to red or brown.:\u200a173\u200a\nAmong other varieties of ochres, it was golden ochre that was valued above others; it was classified as the highest category of pigments in this category. In the 18th-19th centuries, golden ochre was supplied to the rest of Europe and Russia from the province of Rousillon, as a result of which the second name of this paint for a long time was French ochre.:\u200a426\u200a Of the total number of ochres, it is the golden ochre pigment that is closer in purity, brightness and shade all to Attic ochre, the most highly valued yellow paint of Ancient Greece and Rome.\nUntil the mid-20th century, picturesque yellow ochres were traditionally divided into fawn, yellow, saffron yellow, golden and orange. In the modern artist's palette, four types of nominal yellow ochre are most often encountered: light, medium, golden and dark. Natural and Italian sienna can also be considered among the same paints. In terms of composition, golden ochre should include at least 53% Fe2O3, 5% Al2O3 and 34% SiO2 with the complete absence of impurities such as CaO, MgO, MnO2 and insoluble sulfates. For comparison: of all yellow ochres, only dark ochre contains more iron oxide (more than 60%).:\u200a173\u200a\nHistory and use\nTheophanes the Greek, Dormition of the Mother of God (1392)\nGolden ochre is best known as a mineral pigment common in nature, primarily for artistic paints. It has been found since ancient times in rock paintings, frescoes of Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. This pigment was also constantly used when painting temples and in icon painting. When analyzing the colorful composition of the icons of Theophan the Greek, despite all the restraint of his color scheme, golden ochre was clearly established.\nGolden ochre is also used in the production and restoration of expensive types of furniture. For example, when oil gilding on levkas (gesso), several layers of golden ochre are first applied in oil, and then, after drying and grinding, they are coated with oil gulfarbene varnish. As a result, the surface for gilding is perfectly matte and retains the color of the foil. Gilding on carvings looks especially impressive if shiny polished areas alternate with matte ones.\nAs an artist's paint, golden ochre has traditionally been a staple in artists palettes, primarily in oil painting, but also in tempera (including watercolor) and more recently, acrylic. It is stable both in pure form and in mixtures. However, when writing with tempera or watercolor, it is necessary to take into account one feature of ochre, dictated by its mineral nature: with a large amount of water-soluble film former, there is a risk of pigment precipitation (both alumina and iron hydroxide), so it is recommended to use ochre in the form of a thick paste.:\u200a173\u200a\nThe muted, slightly \"earthy\" shade of golden ochre makes it possible to achieve a soft and warm color palette of the painting and, in mixtures with b",
    "Palestinian orthopedic surgeon (1974\u20132024)\nAdnan Al-Bursh (1974\u00a0\u2013 c. 19 April 2024) was a Palestinian orthopedic surgeon and the head of orthopedics at the Gaza Strip's largest medical facility, Al-Shifa Hospital. He died in the Israeli Ofer Prison after over four months of detention.\nThe 50-year-old doctor was arrested by Israeli forces in December 2023 while temporarily working at Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza. Palestinian authorities and advocacy groups have attributed his death to torture or mistreatment in custody, with the OHCHR confirming his body showed signs of torture. His death has been highlighted as part of the \"systematic targeting process against physicians and the health care system in Gaza.\"\nEarly life and career\nAdnan Al-Bursh was born in 1974 in Jabalia, the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, and received his early education there before traveling to Romania to study medicine.\nIn his career, he was a prominent Palestinian orthopedic surgeon who served as the head of orthopedics at Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest medical facility.\nAl-Bursh was married and had five children. He served as an adviser to the Palestine national football team.\nIsrael-Hamas war\nIn November 2023, during the Israeli invasion of Gaza, Al-Bursh was stranded in the besieged Al-Shifa Hospital for 10 days with his nephew. Israeli forces later asked them to move south, but Al-Bursh refused to comply and instead moved north to assist at the Indonesia Hospital. Al-Bursh's wife and six children also refused to move south and instead took shelter in one of the UNRWA schools in the northern Gaza Strip.\nAl-Bursh was later injured while at the Indonesian Hospital while he was in the operating room when Israeli forces also attacked that facility. Following a truce, he relocated again to Al-Awda Hospital, also in northern Gaza.\nArrest and death\nThe 50-year-old doctor was arrested by Israeli forces in December 2023 alongside 10 other workers while temporarily working at Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza.\nFour months later, on 19 April 2024, the Israeli prison service confirmed Al-Bursh's death in custody at Ofer Prison, without disclosing the cause of his death. Palestinian authorities and advocacy groups have attributed his death to torture or mistreatment in custody. Released prisoners told Al-Bursh's family that he was being subjected to torture, and a UN statement on his death confirmed his dead body showed signs of torture. His body was kept in Israeli custody, and the fate of the other detained medical workers remains uncertain.\nIn May 2024, the family of Al-Bursh instructed a lawyer in The Hague to investigate his death and help facilitate the return of his body.\nReactions\nThe Prisoners' Affairs Authority and the Palestinian Prisoners Club labelled Al-Bursh's death an \"assassination\" and a part of the \"systematic targeting process against physicians and the health care system in Gaza.\" The Palestinian Ministry of Health called for an immediate investigation.\nFrancesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, expressed her extreme alarm at the news of Al-Bursh's death and called for better protections. Tlaleng Mofokeng, United Nations' Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, described herself as \"horrified\" by his death, lamenting that Al-Bursh \"died for trying to protect the rights to life and health of his patients\", and called for an international investigation on the matter.\nHis death was highlighted as a further example of the ongoing challenges and risks faced by healthcare workers in Gaza, with hundreds killed, injured or arrested. The Ministry of Health stated that 492 doctors had been killed by Israel in the conflict. The international community and human rights organizations have repeatedly called for an end to attacks on medical personnel and the protection of Palestinians under Israeli occupation.\nAl-Bursh's nephew, Mohammad Al-Bursh, described him as a \"cheerful\" and \"loved\" figure who dedicated his life to his profession, often working nonstop during the height of the conflict in Gaza. Colleagues praised him as a \"rare individual\" and the \"safety valve\" for orthopedic departments across Gaza's hospitals, often working tirelessly even during the height of conflicts in the region.\n",
    "Dutch political scientist and convicted terrorist\nSoumaya Sahla (Dutch pronunciation: ; born 5 July 1983) is a Dutch political scientist and radicalization expert.\nBorn in The Hague, Sahla was arrested in 2005, when she was living with Nouredine el Fahtni, a member of the Islamic terrorist cell Hofstad Network. She spent three years in prison for illegal firearms possession and membership of a terrorist organization. Her conviction was upheld in 2016 by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.\nSahla started studying political science in prison, and she continued with a PhD at Leiden University in 2018. She became an active member of the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in 2017 after she befriended its former leader, Frits Bolkestein. Allegations that she had used their relationship to obtain money, denied by Sahla, resulted in her expulsion from the VVD in 2023.\nEarly life\nSahla was born in 1983 in The Hague's Stationsbuurt, and she grew up in the city's Transvaal neighborhood. She has seven siblings, and her parents had immigrated to the Netherlands from Morocco as guest workers. His father co-founded a mosque together with an Imam, and Sahla established its girl's association.\nTerrorism case\nIntending to study abroad, Sahla moved in with a partner. However, upon learning he was disinterested in her academic ambitions, Sahla moved back with her parents. She finally ran away from her parental home in 2005, as she was pressured to reconcile the relationship. Sahla ended up at Nouredine el Fahtni, a distant relative and a member of the Islamic terrorist cell Hofstad Network.\nThey were arrested weeks later \u2013 in June 2005 \u2013 at Amsterdam Lelylaan station, when El Fahtni was carrying a loaded firearm. Police detectives found more weapons in September 2006 at a place where Sahla had been staying. She was prosecuted as part of the Piranha court case, and her conviction of illegal firearms possession and membership of a terrorist organization was made final by the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in 2016. She had already finished her three-year prison sentence in May 2008. The highest court determined she had been aware of El Fahtni's radical views. Sahla was acquitted of charges that she was helping to plot terrorist attacks against politicians including Geert Wilders despite her having discussed the home addresses of several politicians with her sister.\nEducation and VVD membership\nIn prison, Sahla started studying political science. She graduated from Leiden University, and she finished her master's in African studies in 2018. She continued with a PhD in philosophy of law. She met Frits Bolkestein, the former leader of the VVD, at a book presentation in 2011, and they became close friends. Bolkestein's 2018 book Bij het scheiden van de markt was dedicated to her. Sahla also had contact with politicians Gert-Jan Segers (CU) and Pieter Omtzigt (CDA). She became an active member of the VVD in 2017, joining its thematic networks and hosting debates and round tables as a radicalization expert. Besides, she sat on a radicalization and extremism advisory board of the municipality of Amsterdam.\nWilders started to attack Sahla in late 2021 on social media and in a debate in the House of Representatives \u2013 shortly after the election to the House of her sister, Fonda Sahla. He said that the VVD had taken in a Muslim terrorist and that he was worried for his safety. After Wilders's debate comments, VVD parliamentary leader Sophie Hermans called Sahla's membership a complicated matter. In a statement, Sahla declared she regretted the choices she had made earlier in her life, and she announced a partial retreat from her political activities. Wilders continued to criticize Sahla, including after an October 2023 radio appearance of her.\nOpinion magazine HP/De Tijd published an article on 30 October 2023 in which Sahla was accused by Martijn Bolkestein, the nephew of Frits Bolkestein, of abusing her friendship with Frits to obtain \u20ac85,000, when he had been ill and vulnerable. Sahla denied the allegations; she acknowledged that Bolkestein had payed for her PhD starting in 2018, but she said Bolkestein had been in good health at the time. She filed a criminal complaint against Martijn Bolkestein for defamation. The VVD expelled Sahla from the party the same day the article came out. She unsuccessfully appealed the board's decision, as the appeal committee argued the expulsion had resulted from a cumulation of incidents.\n",

    "Season of television series\n John Mulaney Presents: Everybody's in LA is an American talk show, originally aired live in the United States on Netflix. The series originally aired as a limited series lasting six episodes between May 3 to May 10, 2024, as part of the Netflix is a Joke Festival. The show is hosted by comedian John Mulaney who also serves as the creator and executive producer. Richard Kind serves as the show's announcer. The series features monologues, guests, pre-taped sketches, and musical segments with field pieces shot around Los Angeles.\nConception\nHosted by comedian John Mulaney, each episode will have a theme, a monologue, pre-taped sketches, guest stars, and musical performers and will air live on Netflix at 10pm EDT. There will be six episodes Sunday through Friday from May 5 to 10, 2024, as part of the Netflix is a Joke Festival. The first guest of the talk show, comedian Jerry Seinfeld, stated, \"This is the weirdest show I have ever been on in my life\" and later added \"You\u2019ve brought your amazing rehab zaniness to this show\".\nInfluences\nVariety noted its influences, writing, \"With its wood paneling, warm earth tones, and ample houseplants, the studio for Everybody\u2019s in LA is a \u201870s-inspired nod to the likes of Johnny Carson and Dick Cavett. Character actor Richard Kind, himself a visiting dignitary from New York, assumes the traditional role of the sidekick\".\nEpisodes\nReception\nCritical reviews\nThe series received positive reviews with Matthew Creith of TheWrap declaring, \" reinvents the late night format\" adding \"He\u2019s that good and the eccentric show he\u2019s built is delightfully nonsensical.\" EJ Dickinson of Rolling Stone wrote, \"There\u2019s no real reason for Everybody\u2019s in L.A., a six-episode live special, to exist but, like its host, it is unpredictable and charming\". Alison Herman of Variety described the series as a \"pop-up talk show\", adding \"with Everybody\u2019s in LA Mulaney is back on more comfortable ground: a throwback vehicle for exploring highly personal hobby horses, casting himself as a self-effacing but still smoothly composed master of ceremonies\".\nMichael Martin of The A.V. Club however gave the series a negative review writing, \"Random chaos doesn\u2019t make for consistent comedy, and episode one of Everybody\u2019s In LA managed to come off both manic and sluggish\" before adding, \"The host would be well-advised to settle down, sharpen his comic focus, and take fewer prisoners, himself included\".\n",
    "Temple of Constantinople\nMap of Byzantine Constantinople. The Capitolium lay on the southern slopes of the third hill, northwest of the Forum of Theodosius.\nThe Capitolium of Constantinople (Latin: Capitolium Constantinopolis; Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2) was a public edifice erected in Constantinople (today's Istanbul) by Emperor Constantine the Great. Born as a Capitolium (a temple dedicated to the Capitoline Triad), in the fifth century it was turned into an institute of higher education.\nLocation\nOriginally the Capitolium was thought to be located at the top of the third hill of Constantinople, which is now occupied by the University of Istanbul. However, this position is refuted by De Ceremoniis, a 10th-century Byzantine ceremonial book, which mentions it as a landmark along the Emperor's triumphal procession. The procession started at the Golden Gate, and moved along the southern branch of the mese odos reaching in succession the Forum of the Ox (placed at today's Aksaray), the Capitolium and the Philadelphion (placed at today's \u015eehzadeba\u015f\u0131 semt). The temple's position should then be between the Forum of the Ox and the Philadelphion, northwest of the Forum of Theodosius. To reach it, one had to climb the southern slopes of the third hill, akin to the ascent to Rome's Capitol to go to the Jupiter's Temple. Administratively it belonged to the eighth regio of the city.\nHistory\nThe Capitolium  was erected in Constantinople by Emperor Constantine the Great (r.\u2009306\u2013337). The building, together with the circus, the Great Palace, the Strategion and the forum, was one of those edifices needed to introduce the city as the new Rome. The edifice was originally a capitolium, that is a pagan temple dedicated to the Capitoline Triad, but in the early fifth century a cross had already been put on its roof, although a conversion to church is not attested. Near the temple were built houses for the rich. At the latest in 425 AD the Capitolium was turned into an academy of higher education, the Pandidakterion, hosting public lessons at the southern exedrae. The sole purpose of the school was to educate civil servants for the administration of the state. There is no evidence that the Pandidakterion continued to work after the end of the reign of Heraclius (r.\u2009610\u2013641) .\nDescription\nAccording to a law promulgated on 27 February 425 AD by Emperor Theodosius II (r.\u2009402\u2013450)  and contained in the Codex Theodosianus, it is known that the Capitolium was a rectangular edifice whose southern side had \"large and magnificent\" exedrae which bordered the porticoed side of a public road. This road could possibly be the mese odos, and the building overlooked the road near the junction whence one of its branches led to the Golden Gate. The Capitolium had also exedrae along its eastern and western sides, but these did not border any road, and until 425 were occupied by popinae (\"wine bars\" in the Roman world). The edifice was gilded, and its roof was covered with gilded bronze tiles, like the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus in Rome, and topped by a cross (fallen because of a storm in 407 AD).\nNotes\n^ a b c d e f g h i Janin (1950), p. 172\n^ Janin (1950), p. 60\n^ Janin (1950), p. 171\n^ a b c d e Crawley Quinn & Wilson (2013) p. 147\n^ Cod.

    "South Korean company\nThe Poongsan Corporation (Korean:\u00a0\ud48d\uc0b0; Hanja:\u00a0\u8c4a\u5c71; RR:\u00a0Pung-san) is a South Korean manufacturer of copper and copper alloy materials, ammunition and precision forging products founded in 1968. The company's main business areas are non-ferrous metal processing, such as bi-metallic coins and copper alloy products, which account for 70% of sales, and it also manufactures various military ammunition, gunpowder, and propellants. As of 2023, bimetallic coin products produced in Poongsan are exported to more than 70 countries and account for more than 50% of the global coin blank market.\nHistory\nNon-ferrous metal industry\nThe Poongsan was established as Poongsan Metal Industry Co., Ltd. (Korean:\u00a0\ud48d\uc0b0\uae08\uc18d\uacf5\uc5c5; Hanja:\u00a0\u8c4a\u5c71\u91d1\u5c6c\u5de5\u696d; RR:\u00a0Pungsan Geumsok Gongeop) in October 1968, and began producing copper alloy products after completing the Bupyeong plant in 1969. The company began supplying brass coin blanks to Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation in 1970, and in 1973, it entered the export market by winning a contract to supply coin blanks worth $3.5 million to Taiwan.\nStarting with the first overseas supply, in 1985, it won a contract to supply 7,500 tons of coin blanks to India. By the late 1980s, coin blanks produced in Poongsan had been supplied to 30 countries, and manufactured commemorative coins for the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Olympics.\nIn the 1990s, the company developed its own bimetallic coin for euro currency made of copper alloy materials and began supplying it to the Netherlands and Italy in 2001.\nThe company's revenue in the coin blank market has been declining annually since 2013 due to the decline in the use of money with the spread of electronic payment systems.\nDefense industry\nIn 1970, it was designated as one of the five key companies for South Korea's industrialization policy and became the first private company to enter the defense industry. Later, in 1973, the Angang Ammunition Plant was completed in Gyeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and it was also South Korea's first defense industry facility.\nAs a result of accelerating the industrialization of import substitution by research and development from 1973, in the late 1970s, all kinds of small, medium, and large-caliber rounds used in the Korean military began to be produced, and the localization rate of parts was 95 percent.\nIn 1982, after acquiring the 1st armory in Busan, it established a subsidiary, PMC, to produce various military and sports rounds based on small-caliber ammunition manufacturing technology.\nThe impact of the Russo-Ukrainian war has sent demand and prices for military ammunition soaring, and exports of various large-caliber rounds abroad boosted sales in the company's defense division in 2023.\nBusinesses\nNon-ferrous meterial\nCopper applications are Poongsan's main area of expertise. The company produces copper and copper alloy sheets and strips, tubes, rods, and wires for use in various industries. Poongsan is one of the world's largest suppliers of coin blanks. It was Korea's sole coin manufacturer in 1970, and it first exported coin blanks to Taiwan in 1973, then to other countries, including the EU and the U.S.\nDefence\nPoongsan ammunition\nPoongsan produces a variety of ammunition types, such as 5.56-millimeter rifle bullets, 155\u00a0mm howitzer shells, anti-aircraft shells, mortar shells, tank shells, and naval artillery shells. The U.S. is Poongsan's largest ammunition export destination. The Middle East is a major market and also exports to Europe.\nProducts\n105\u00d7617mmR\n120\u00d7570mm NATO\nSee also\nList of military headstamps\nDefense industry of South Korea\n",

    "Internment camps in Ethiopia during the prime ministership of Abiy Ahmed during the 2020s include camps holding Tigrayans during the Tigray War, Eritreans, and Amharas during the War in Amhara.\nTigrayans\nSee also: Ethnic discrimination in Ethiopia \u00a7\u00a0Detentions\nInternment camps to hold Tigrayans were run during the Tigray War, starting in November 2020, when 700 ethnic Tigrayans were detained in Addis Ababa. The number dropped to around 300 in December 2020. Authorities cited the reason for detention as being suspicion of links to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). An Abbadi warehouse detention site in Mai Kadra held 3000 to 8000 detainees, including 400 chlidren and people aged in their 70s and 80s, during November 2020, with no provision of food or water by the camp guards; Doctors Without Borders had access to the camp and provided food and water.\nIn April 2021, 500 ethnic Tigrayans were held under arbitrary arrest based on their ethnic identity in an Addis Ababa detention centre. Conditions were described as \"miserable\" by a health worker, with around 30 detainees per room. None of the detainees had been brought before a judge as of May 2021. A wave of arrests of ethnic Tigrayans and of journalists took place in July 2021. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) stated that it was monitoring the detentions.\nIn September, Amhara Region forces detained \"thousands\" of ethnic Tigrayan men, women and children, residents of Humera, in detention centres that witnesses described to the The Daily Telegraph as concentration camps, in which eyes were removed from one victim, victims' limbs were cut off and bodies were thrown into mass graves. According to a participant of a public meeting in Humera, the Amhara forces stated, \"We should exterminate all Tigrayan residents in the city. We must cleanse them all.\" An administrative list indicating residents's identification as Tigrayan from their identity cards was used to find Tigrayans in house-to-house operations. Salon.com, based on witness reports by former detainees and doctors, satellite imagery and video recordings, stated that children among the detainees were starved and abused.\nIn November 2021, a wave of ethnicity-based arrests of Tigrayans including \"dozens of priests, monks, deacons and others\" took place. The New York Times described these as having \"swept up anyone of Tigrayan descent, many of whom had no ties to the rebels or even affinity for them,\" including \"mothers with children and the elderly\". Laetitia Bader of HRW described the state of emergency, which formally permitted the mass detentions, as \"'legitimizing and legalizing unlawful practices' and creating a 'real climate of fear'.\" On 20 November, Genocide Watch classified the Ethiopian situation as including stage 8 of genocide, persecution.\nMirab Abaya massacre\nBased on its investigation including \"26 interviews with prisoners, medical personnel, officials, local residents and relatives, and on a review of satellite imagery, social media posts and medical records\", The Washington Post found that on one day in November 2021, 83 Tigrayan prisoners were executed in the Mirab Abaya detention camp, which held from 2000 to 2500 Tigrayan soldiers and former soldiers, by about 18 of the camp guards. The victims' bodies were piled in a mass gave near the camp entrance. The massacre stopped when Girma Ayele, a colonel, arrived. Girma stated that the guards suspected of the killings were arrested.\nOfficials in Mirab Abaya made announcements on loudspeakers requesting locals to kill any escapees. Among a group of prisoners who escaped from the camp during the massacre, most were lynched by a group of local residents.\nThe EHRC stated that it was investigating the massacre.\nAbuses and killings\nTorture and beatings were systematic at the camps. In the Abbadi camp in November 2020, guards stated in response to a request for the purchase of insulin for a detainee with diabetes, \"We are not here to treat you; we are here to kill you. We are gathering the Tigrayan refugees here to kill them.\"\nNumbers\nIn November 2021, Salsay Weyane Tigray estimated 20,000 to 30,000 detentions of Tigrayans outside of war zones. African Citizens estimated the number of Tigrayans held \"just for the crime of who they are or where they come from\" to be 40,000 on 26 November 2021. On the same day, Clark, Lapsley & Alton estimated 30,000 Tigrayan civilians detained in Addis Ababa, 15,000 Tigrayan military detained since late 2020, and unknown numbers of Tigrayans held in western Tigray and elsewhere in Ethiopia.\nEritreans\nIn July 2022, Eritrean refugees were held in detention camps near Debarq in Amhara Region and near Alemwach.\nAmharas\nDuring the War in Amhara, Amharas were held in detention centres that were overcrowded and had insufficient access to medical care, leading to two hundred deaths in September 2023 due to a cholera outbreak.\nTerminology\nSee also: Internment \u00a7\u00a0Defining internment and concentration camp\nTh",

Founded by a group of former Huawei engineers,  the company has been dubbed \"Little Huawei\" in the industry.\nBackground\nInovance was founded in April 2003 by Zhu Xingming and several other engineers from Huawei. When the company was founded, it aimed to compete in the high-end market with foreign companies and never to fall into a price war with domestic companies.\nOn 28 September 2010, Inovance held its initial public offering and became a listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Afterwards it expanded its product range from single frequency changers to other  industrial control products such as programmable logic controllers and servomechanisms.\nOriginally servicing the lower end market, the company gradually moved to take market share in the higher end market from European and Japanese incumbents.\nAccording to a report by Deutsche Bank in 2017, Inovance stood to benefit heavily from the Made in China 2025 policy that would increased domestic industrial automation demand. At the time foreign companies still controlled 65% of China's industrial automation market.\nIn June 2021, Inovance announced it had secured a CNY2.1\u00a0billion private placement from twelve investors that included Hillhouse Investment, CITIC Securities, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, UBS and AIA Group. The company plamed to use the proceeds from it to  acquire the remaining 49 percent stake in subsidiary Inovance Control Technology as well as expanding its output of automation control equipment, and developing smart software. Its stock price rose 7.9% after the announcement.\nIn January 2024, Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology announced it teamed up with Inovance to launch a program to train senior engineers and a technology research institute for robotics.\nIn April 2024, Zhu stated the company hopes it would be able to challenge larger incumbents such as ABB and Siemens for a place in the top three largest companies in the sector globally within five years. He also stated he believe Chinese automation companies will keep global supply chains running and insulate them from protectionism as they try to expand overseas.\n",

The majority of the race was held on Friday, May 10, 2024, and would end shortly after midnight on Saturday, May 11, due to constant rain showers that delayed the start. The race was held in Darlington, South Carolina at Darlington Raceway, a 1.366 miles (2.198\u00a0km) permanent asphalt egg-shaped speedway. The race was originally scheduled to be contested over 147 laps, but was increased to 150 laps due to a NASCAR overtime finish. In a wild and action packed race, Ross Chastain, driving for Niece Motorsports, would steal the win after taking the lead on the final restart, and held off a fast charging field to earn his fifth career NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series win, and his first of the season. Corey Heim, who started second, was the most dominant driver of the race, winning both stages and leading a race-high 77 laps, but finished 28th after being involved in a late race incident. To fill out the podium, Nick Sanchez, driving for Rev Racing, and Ben Rhodes, driving for ThorSport Racing, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively.\nReport\nBackground\nDarlington Raceway, the circuit where the race will be held.\nDarlington Raceway is a race track built for NASCAR racing located near Darlington, South Carolina. It is nicknamed \"The Lady in Black\" and \"The Track Too Tough to Tame\" by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as \"A NASCAR Tradition.\" It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that is effective at both ends.\nSince 2015, the race has hosted NASCAR's Throwback weekend, which features cars sporting paint schemes that pay homage to past teams and drivers.  (The lineage of this race includes races billed as the Southern 500 from 2005 to 2020.)\nEntry list\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n(i) denotes driver who is ineligible for series driver points.\nPractice\nThe first and only practice was held on Friday, May 10, at 3:05 PM\u00a0EST, and would last for 20 minutes. Christian Eckes, driving for McAnally-Hilgemann Racing, would set the fastest time in the session, with a lap of 29.540, and a speed of 166.473\u00a0mph (267.912\u00a0km/h).\nQualifying\nQualifying was held on Friday, May 10, at 3:35 PM\u00a0EST. Since\u00a0Darlington Raceway\u00a0is an\u00a0intermediate speedway, the qualifying system used is a single-car, single-lap system with only one round. Drivers will be on track by themselves and will have one lap to post a qualifying time. Whoever sets the fastest time in that round will win the pole.\nNick Sanchez, driving for Rev Racing, would score the pole for the race, with a lap of 29.288, and a speed of 167.905\u00a0mph (270.217\u00a0km/h).\nNo drivers would fail to qualify.\nQualifying results\nRace results\nStage 1 Laps: 45\nStage 2 Laps: 45\nStage 3 Laps: 60\nStanding after the race\n",

Each of the five groups of the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n RFEF are represented by the four teams that finished the regular season between the second and fifth positions. In the draw for the first stage, the participating teams were assigned to pots corresponding to their final regular season position. While avoiding matches between teams from the same regular season group, second-place finishers were drawn against fifth-place finishers while teams that finished third would play teams that finished fourth. The same draw process was repeated, to the extent that it would be possible, in the draw for the second round.\nThe five winning clubs of the second stage attained promotion to Primera RFEF and accompanied the five group champions who had already achieved their promotion.\nThe final two relegation spots (of 27 total) were also determined via play-offs. The four 13th-place finishers with the lowest point totals were drawn into two single-leg matches, with the winners securing survival in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n RFEF and the losers being relegated to the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n RFEF. The two match-ups were selected through a random draw and hosted at a venue chosen from among the stadiums selected to host the promotion play-offs.\nPromotion play-offs\nTeams\nParticipating teams\nAtl\u00e9tico Paso\nBadalona Futur\nBarakaldo\nBetis Deportivo\nDeportivo Arag\u00f3n\nEuropa\nGetafe B\nGuijuelo\nLleida Esportiu\nUD Logro\u00f1\u00e9s\nMarbella\nNumancia\nOrihuela\nPontevedra\nRayo Cantabria\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes\nSant Andreu\nUtebo\nYeclano\nZamora\nRoad to the play-offs\nGroup 1\nUpdated to match(es) played on 5 May 2024.

    "\nIn 1624 the city of Fez in northern Morocco was devastated by a major earthquake between three and four in the morning of 11 May. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.0 Mw and a maximum felt intensity of VIII\u2013IX on the MSK scale. The earthquake caused severe damage in Fez and the surrounding area. It was felt as far away as Seville in southern Spain. Thousands of people died.\nTectonic setting\nFez lies within the southern part of the Rif, which forms part of the Gibraltar Arc. The Rif and the Betic Cordillera were formed during the Cenozoic, initially as a result of convergence between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The collisional structure was modified during the Miocene by a combination of westward migration of the mountain belt and extension that resulted in formation of the Alboran Sea The extension may be a result of back-arc basin formation related to subduction during the Miocene. Although it remains unclear whether there is still active subduction, the convergence continues at a rate of 4 mm per year in a NW\u2013SE direction. The most external part of the Rif is formed of a series of thrust faults and related folds, referred to as the Prerif.\nEarthquake\nThe magnitude of this event has been estimated from the distribution of seismic intensities, giving a mean value of 6.0 Mw\u202f. From a description of damage in contemporary reports, the seismic intensity associated with this earthquake is estimated to have been VIII\u2013IX at Fez, VII\u2013VIII at Mekn\u00e8s and Sefrou, VII at Beni Zeroual, VI\u2013VII at Taza, VI at Beni Ouriaghel, P.V. Gomera and Sal\u00e9, V at Melilla and IV at Safi.\nThe Sa\u00efss basin lies to the south of Fez. There is evidence from seismites found in the lacustrian and fluvial sediments deposited in this basin that the area has been affected by active tectonics since at least the Late Pliocene (3.6 million years ago). The Southern Rif Front, which borders the basin, is formed of a series of faults and related folds. The western part of this fault zone is a likely location for the rupture that caused the 1624 earthquake.\nDamage\nFez suffered the most severe effects of the earthquake. Very few buildings were unaffected, with many collapsing. The damage was greatest in the older part of the city, Fes el Bali. This difference in damage is reflected in the reported number of casualties, with over 2,500 dead in Fes el Bali compared to only eleven in the newer district of Fes el-Jdid and none in the Mellah. At Mekn\u00e8s, two towers were destroyed and two fatalities were reported, while at Sefrou four houses were ruined but there were no deaths.\nSee also\n1755 Meknes earthquake - badly damaged Meknes and Fez\nList of earthquakes in Morocco\n",
    "German politician (1919\u20132008)\nHans Albrecht (22 November 1919 \u2013 27 March 2008) was a German politician and high-ranking party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as the longtime First Secretary of the SED in Bezirk Suhl and was a member of the Central Committee of the SED and the National Defence Council. In the Berlin Wall shooting trials, he was sentenced to five years and one month in prison for manslaughter.\nLife and career\nAlbrecht came from a working-class family in the Ruhr area. A few months after completing his training as a locksmith, he was drafted into the Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht for the duration of World War II.\nAfter the war, Albrecht settled in Saxony, worked as a heating engineer, and joined the SPD (Social Democratic Party) in his hometown of Bennewitz. He became a member of the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) in 1946 following the forced merger of the SPD and KPD (Communist Party of Germany).\nPolitical career\nEarly career\nFrom 1946 he was a staff member, later until 1949 secretary of the district leadership of the new SED in Grimma.\nBezirk Frankfurt (Oder) career\nIn 1950 he attended the \"Karl Marx\" Party Academy. Subsequently, his stations from 1951 were Frankfurt (Oder), Eberswalde, and Stalinstadt, where he became First Secretary of the SED district leadership, and from 1954 also worked in the Bezirk Frankfurt (Oder) SED leadership. In the same year, he was elected as a candidate member of the Central Committee of the SED. He held this status until January 1963 (VI. Party Congress), after which he became a full member.\nSince 1958 chairman of the Bezirk Economic Council and member of the Bezirk legislature, he became chairman of the Council of Bezirk Frankfurt (Oder) in 1960, formally making him head of government of the Bezirk. However, he was de facto subservient to the local SED leadership.\nFrom 1963 he completed a two-year study at the Industrial Institute of the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, which he completed a with a degree in industrial engineering (Dipl.-Ing. oec.). After completing his studies in Freiberg, he became the first deputy chairman of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection of the GDR, succeeding G\u00fcnter Sieber, who became Minister for Trade and Supply.\nBezirk Suhl SED First Secretary\nAlbrecht (right of center) and Volkskammer President Horst Sindermann (right) visiting farmers in Kaltensundheim in February 1988\nIn August 1968, he succeeded Otto Funke as First Secretary of the Bezirk Suhl SED leadership, a position he held for 21 years until 1989. Bezirk Suhl had the smallest population and was the most geographically isolated Bezirk of the GDR.\nHe additionally became member of the Volkskammer in 1971 and a member of the presidium of the German-Arab Society of the GDR. In 1972, he was elected to the National Defense Council of the GDR, likely due to the long western border of Bezirk Suhl with West Germany.\nAlbrecht's leadership was viewed negatively. His leadership style was authoritarian, occasionally described as dictatorial, and he was viewed as a hardliner.\nIn 1988, he unsuccessfully tried to pressure Bad Salzungen SED First Secretary Hans-Dieter Fritschler to rescind his statements in the book Der Erste (English: The first one). The book provided an unfalsified account of Fritschler's work as a local SED functionary and detailed the GDR's problems, including dysfunction stemming from the Bezirk Suhl SED leadership.\nAlbrecht was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in Gold in 1974, and the Karl Marx Order in 1979.\nPeaceful Revolution\nDuring the Wende, on 2 November 1989, the Bezirk Suhl SED removed him from the position of First Secretary and installed reformer Peter Pechauf as his successor. He was removed by his party from the Volkskammer two weeks later, on 16 November 1989.\nAt its last session on 3 December 1989, the Central Committee expelled Albrecht from the Central Committee and from the SED shortly before its collective resignation.\nReunified Germany\nAlbrecht passed away in 2008 at the age of 88.\nProsecution after the Wende\nConviction for abuse of office and embezzlement\nAfter the Wende, Albrecht was arrested for abuse of power and embezzlement. In October 1992, he was sentenced by the Meiningen Regional Court to 22 months in prison for incitement to embezzlement. He did not have to serve the sentence because he had already served more than half of the time in pre-trial detention.\nConviction for manslaughter\nAfter the German reunification, he was indicted in May 1991 as part of the Berlin Wall shooting trials with another arrest warrant. As part of the trials against former members of the National Defense Council of the GDR, he was charged with \"complicity in manslaughter\" (political responsibility for the fatal shootings at the Berlin Wall) before the Berlin Regional Court.\nOn 16 September 1993, he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for incitement to manslaughter",

    "Biblical figure from the book of Samuel and Kings\nShimei curses David. 1860 woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld\nShimei ben Gera is a Biblical figure from the Book of II Samuel and the Book of I Kings. He was from the tribe of Benjamin and was related to King Saul. II Samuel relates that when King David was fleeing from his son Absalom, Shimei cursed him as he passed through the village of Bahurim:\n5. And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing as he came. 6. And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 7. And thus said Shimei when he cursed: 'Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow; 8. the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.'\nShimei's curse has been interpreted as referring to the killing of Abner ben Ner and the death of Ish-bosheth, King Saul's general and son. Alternatively, other interpretation attribute Shimei's animosity to David from the fact that he saw David as the one who removed Saul's family from the throne.\nThe Talmud says that Shimei cursed David because of his sin with Bathsheba, calling him an adulterer, a Moabite, a murderer, an oppressor, and an abomination.\nAbishai ben Zeruiah, David's military leader, wanted to kill Shimei on the spot, but David did not permit him.\n9. Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king: 'Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.' 10. And the king said: 'What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him: Curse David; who then shall say: Wherefore hast thou done so?' 11. And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants: 'Behold, my son, who came forth of my body, seeketh my life; how much more this Benjamite now? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath bidden him. 12. It may be that the Lord will look on mine eye, and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.' 13. So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. \n\nAfter David's army defeated Absalom's force, as he crossed back over the Jordan River to return to Jerusalem, Shimei came with about 1,000 men to ask him for forgiveness. Once again, Abishai asked permission to kill Shimei, but David forgave him. Some scholars attribute David's forgiveness to the desire to make peace with the Tribe of Benjamin. \nAccording to Yalkut Shimoni, Shimei addressed David as follows: \"The brothers of Joseph did him injury, but Joseph returned good for evil. Be thou as Joseph, and recompense me with good, though I dealt evilly with thee. It was not I alone but all Israel that entreated thee ill. They now await my fate, and if thou forgivest me, they will come and make peace with thee and surrender themselves to thee\" (Yal\u1e33. ii. 151)\nHowever, on his deathbed, David instructed his son Solomon to deal appropriately with Shimei and punish him for his actions.\nSolomon followed his father's instructions. He ordered Shimei to move to Jerusalem and forbade him to leave the city on pain of death. For three years, Shimei obeyed the order and remained in Jerusalem, but after three years he left to pursue two slaves who escaped to the kingdom of Achish, king of Gath. When he returned to Jerusalem, Solomon had him put to death.\nIn rabbinic Judaism\nThe Talmud records different opinions about Shimei. According to Rabbi \u1e24iyya bar Ami citing Ulla, Shimei was Solomon's teacher. The Talmud further states that as long as Shimei was alive, Solomon refrained from marrying Pharaoh's daughter and other foreign wives. The statement instructs that this shows that a person should always live in the same place as his teacher.\nIn contrast, Midrash Rabba describes Shimei was wicked. He is listed alongside the wicked kings of Judah, Ahaz and Amon. All three were spared by God because of the righteous children who would be descended from them. According to this midrash, Mordecai was descended from Shimei. In Yalkut Shimoni it states that the reason David did not kill Shimei was that he was with the Holy Spirit that Mordechai would come from him and would save the Jewish people.\nIn Midrash Shmuel and Yalkut Shimoni it is the merit of Shimei's wife that saved Shimei and Mordechai, and by extension the Jews of Persia from Haman's decrees. These midrashim relate that she hid and protected Jonathan ben Abiathar and Ahimaaz ben Zadok when they had been sent by Hushai the Archite to tell David of Absalom's plans and were being pursued by",
    "\nThe Sirtica campaign, or Sirte campaign, was a military campaign executed by the Regio Esercito that took place between November 1924 and March 1925. It was one of the first actions during the Second Italo-Senussi War.\nBackground\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Italy found itself in difficulty in maintaining control over its territory in Fezzan where, moreover, was the activity of the Senussi rebels who were supported by Turkish garrisons led by commander Enver Bey, who remained in Libya even after the signing of the peace treaty. In December 1914, therefore, all the Italian military garrisons in Fezzan were abandoned, including the one of Brak, where the forces had been concentrated before the retreat. Since then, Italian dominion remained precarious and limited to a narrow coastal strip. During the conflict, Italy withdrew part of its troops and dismantled the garrisons in the interior of the two regions, also because of the defeats at Gasr Bu Hadi and Sidi Abu Arqub, while it maintained its coastal garrisons in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica to counter Senussi offensives who were supported by Ottoman and German supplies. After the campaign, which ended in a Central Powers defeat, a new conflict rose up, which would totally confirm Italian rule in Libya.\nCourse of the Campaign\nTo regain possession of northern Tripolitania, all that was needed was the reoccupation of Sirtica, in which leaders and armed men from the newly conquered territories had taken refuge. The Governor deemed it appropriate this time to precede a brief political preparation, through which numerous people from Misuratino and Orfella were able to return to their countries. Then, decided to act energetically. The task was given to Colonel Mezzetti who, concentrating his forces including 3 battalions, 3 squadrons, 1 battery, and other elements near Misrata, advanced along the western coast of Great Sirte and, after defeated some light enemy resistance at Gasr Bu Hadi (south of Sirte itself), entered Sirte on 23 November 1924. With these actions, after 35 months of prudent political and military action, the cycle that brought all of northern Tripolitania back under direct Italian rule was closed. Since then, the activity of the Government of Tripolitania was dedicated to the preparation of the troops and especially to the establishment of special Saharan units, as well as to the political-military organization of the territory with the establishment of \"civil police stations\" in the Gebel area and with the creation of the \u00abCommand of the territories of the southern Tripoli area\u00bb.\n",
    "Lifeboat station in Tyne and Wear, England\nTynemouth Lifeboat Station is located on the River Tyne, at Fish Quay, North Shields, in the county of Tyne and Wear.\nA lifeboat was first stationed across the River Tyne in South Shields in 1789, with a second lifeboat placed in North Shields in 1798, both operated by the Tyne Lifeboat Institution (TLI).\nThe Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) currently operates a Severn-class lifeboat 17-34 Osier (ON 1263), and a D-class (IB1) Inshore lifeboat Little Susie (D-829).\nHistory\nIn the late 1700s, two lifeboats were operated at Tynemouth by the Tyne Lifeboat Institution (TLI), both built by Henry Greathead, to an amalgamated design of both Greathead and William Wouldhave. At the time, the mouth of the River Tyne was particularly treacherous in poor weather, many ships lost, but many lives saved.\nSafety would be radically improved in later years, with the construction of the North and South Tyne Piers, building starting in 1854, but only completed in 1910.\nThe first lifeboat, known as Original, was wrecked in 1830. The Tyne Lifeboat Institution would not have the funds for a replacement until 1833. In 1832, a request for a lifeboat was placed by the Port of Newcastle Shipwreck Association with the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), who supplied a 26-foot Palmer-type non-self-righting lifeboat, arriving in October 1832, to be managed by the TLI. A new boathouse had been constructed at Prior's Haven. The boat was on service for 10 years, until it was badly damaged in 1842, and scrapped.\nTyne lifeboat on display in South Shields\nThe Tyne Institution would maintain their fleet of lifeboats, providing 2 new boats and a new boathouse at South Beach, South Shields, in 1841\u20132. On 4 December 1849, the Tyne Institution lifeboat Providence was launched to the aid to the brig Betsy, which had run ashore at Herd sands. Whilst alongside the vessel, the Providence was capsized. Tyne was launched, and picked up three survivors still holding onto the Providence, and North Shields lifeboat Northumberland rescued the crew of the Betsy, plus one lifeboat man who had managed to get aboard. 20 of the 24 crew of the Providence were lost.\nIt was as a result of this disaster that Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, of Alnwick Castle, president of the RNIPLS, set a competition for the design of a Self-righting lifeboat, which was won by James Beeching of Great Yarmouth. This design would become the basis for lifeboats for many years afterwards.\nIn 1862, following a series of shipwrecks in and around Prior's Haven, it was suggested that the (now) RNLI should place a lifeboat at a new station at Prior's Haven. A new boathouse was constructed, and the Constance, a 33-foot self-righting 10-oared lifeboat, arrived in November 1862. The Prior, a TLI boat, was relocated from Prior's Haven to South Beach, South Shields.\nFollowing the wreck of the Stanley in 1864, it was decided to place a second lifeboat at Tynemouth, with the RNLI building a new station at Black Middens. Both lifeboat services would operate alongside each other until the early 1900s, often responding to the same shipwreck, one or other standing by while a rescue was performed. However, in 1905, everything changed when the RNLI placed a motor-powered lifeboat at Tynemouth, followed soon after by the completion of the Piers. A motor lifeboat was far better placed to respond, and fewer rescues were required, with the mouth of the River Tyne now protected. The TLI would be renamed the Tyne Lifeboat Society (TLS) in 1905, maintaining the last of their lifeboats until the 1940s. The RNLI No.2 station was closed.\nAfter some years with the motor lifeboat moored afloat, the RNLI took over a boathouse belonging to the War-office in 1921. It was located right next to the Tyne Lifeboat Society boathouse at Clifford's Fort. The lifeboat was mounted on a trolley, which could be winched up or down a trolley-way. In 1941, bombs dropped in a war-time air-raid destroyed the Tyne Lifeboat house, containing the James Young lifeboat, and the RNLI boathouse, containing the John Pymont (ON 824). A replacement boathouse and slipway would be constructed at the same location in 1947.\nTo commemorate the centenary of the Tynemouth lifeboat station, a stained glass window, showing a picture of the Original lifeboat, was unveiled by Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland at the Seamen's Chapel of Christ Church, North Shields on 16 September 1962.\n1965 would see the arrival of the first Tynemouth Inshore lifeboat, one of the earliest inshore D-class (RFD PB16) boats numbered D-12. When a new All-weather Arun-class lifeboat arrived in 1980, the boat would once again be moored afloat. A replacement station building, housing the Inshore lifeboat, launched with the use of a davit, and a mooring for the All-weather boat were provided in 1997.

    "\nEstonia is set to participate at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2024 in Madrid, Spain. Estonian broadcaster ERR is responsible for the country's participation in the contest and chose Annabelle Ats to represent the country through the national selection T\u00e4htede lava\u00a0.\nBackground\nEstonia debuted in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2023. ERR had previously broadcast the contest in 2003 and 2004, however cited financial reasons for Estonia's absence from participation in the junior contest in the years running up to their debut appearance. Broadcasters from the Baltic countries, including Estonia, expressed interest in taking part in the 2016 contest, which never materialised. ERR internally selected Arhanna to represent the country in 2023, with her song \"Hoiame kokku\" also being internally selected and released at a later date. At the contest Arhanna finished 15th with 49 points.\nERR's head of entertainment Karmel Killandi\u00a0, while interviewing Arhanna, Estonia's representative in the previous contest, said that she \"opened the door\" for artists to \"perform in front of this huge audience\" in future years, suggesting that Estonia could take part in 2024. On 24 November 2023, ahead of the country's debut in the contest, Estonian broadcaster ERR said that it would be looking into the possibilities of making the singing competition T\u00e4htede lava\u00a0 its national final for Junior Eurovision. This was confirmed the following 4 May, ahead of the final of T\u00e4htede lava.\nBefore Junior Eurovision\nT\u00e4htede lava 2024\nERR selected the Estonian representative with the biennial television program T\u00e4htede lava\u00a0 (transl.\u2009Star Stage); the 2022 series of the show was won by Arhanna, who also won in her younger category in 2019, which motivated her selection to represent the country on its debut appearance in 2023. All shows were hosted by Jaagup Tuisk and Aaron Thor H\u00e4rm and directed by Kristo Veinberg.\nContest overview\nThe 2024 series of the competition commenced on 7 April, together with the selection show of the youngest age category, which consisted of singers aged between 3 and 7 years old, and continued the following week with the selection show of the middle age category, consisting of 8 to 10 year olds, being held on 14 April; the eldest age category for singers aged between 11 and 13 years old had a selection show held on 21 April, where the three artists with the most points qualified to the final directly and an additional wildcard finalist was chosen according to the public votes. The winners of the two younger age categories were revealed during a live show, called the \"first final\", held on 28 April, while the winner of the eldest category, as well as the Estonian representative in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, was selected on 5 May during the so-called \"second final\".\nFollowing a total of eight performances (two per each finalist: one solo performance and one featuring a well-known Estonian performer), the winner of the second final was determined by a combination of votes from the public and a six-member jury panel composed of Sirje Medell (singing and music teacher), Kadri Hunt (conductor, singing teacher), Robert Linna\u00a0 (musician), Ewert Sundja (musician, songwriter), Alice Aleksandridi (choreographer) and Maris Aljaste (organiser of Tallinna laste jazzifestival Kr\u00e4sh). At the end of the show, 13 year-old Annabelle Ats was announced as the winner of T\u00e4htede lava's eldest age category.\n",
    "\nIssa Issaka Aubin, also known as General Aubin (1969 or 1970 - 27 March 2020), was a Central African warlord and the founder of PRNC.\nLife\n2006 - 2013\nAubin, who belongs to the Gula, was born in 1969 or 1970. He joined the UFDR rebel group in 2006 due to the government's neglect of his origin, Vakaga and was appointed as the UFDR chief of staff.\nAubin later joined S\u00e9l\u00e9ka and was assigned as the group's chief of staff. He led the Seleka's attack Nd\u00e9l\u00e9 in December 2012. On 22 March 2013, he commanded the 1000 Seleka rebels from Damara and Sibut to participate in Battle of Bangui. Aubin was reportedly wounded during a clash with South African forces. On 20 August 2013, he arrested ten looters wearing military uniforms who stole mattresses, televisions, suitcases, and medicines. Djotodia appointed Aubin as the Director of Presidential Security on 9 September 2013.\n2014 - 2019\nIn 2014, he was part of the coordinator of the Crisis Military Committee of the former Seleka coalition. In April 2014, he released a press release supporting MISCA's DDR process throughout the country and calling the Central Africans to solve their issues for the country's development. In the same month, he signed the agreement with the government on behalf of ex-Seleka that allowed the authorities to transfer former Seleka's members to encampments in Sibut before returning to their origins. However, it sparked controversies among the ex-Seleka. They rejected the agreement signing since they did not get involved in the discussion.\nIn the unknown year, Aubin joined RPRC and became one of the group's military leaders. He commanded the PRNC's attack at the Anti-balaka base in Bria , which eliminated its commander, Theophile Ndoumba, on 25 September 2018. However, he was disgruntled by the RPRC leader, Ahaba's action of signing the peace agreement. Apart from that, he was one of the signatories of the Gula-Peuhl Peace Agreement in Bria as a Gula representative on 3 May 2018.\n2019 - 2020\nDue to the tension with Ahaba, Aubin founded PRNC on 28 May 2019 in Tiringoulou and designated Nourd Gregaza as the group's leader. He became the PRNC's spokesperson and chief of staff. Aubin and MLCJ's chief of staff, Ali Abderahmane, prepared and commanded the attack in Birao, Tissi, and Am Dafok. He sent his forces from Tiringoulou to partake in the attack. Apart from that, he also attempted to forge alliances with Noureddine Adam and Mahamat Al-Khatim. However, they rejected it.\nHe was killed in Ndiffa on 27 March 2020 during a clash between PRNC-RPRC and the Misseriya Arab militia. His death deteriorated Gula and Misseriya Arab relations.\n",
    "Japanese manga series\nFuku-chan (\u30d5\u30af\u3061\u3083\u3093) is a manga series by Ry\u016bichi Yokoyama. The yonkoma series appeared in Japanese newspapers from 1936 to 1971, making it one of the longest-running Japanese comic strip series. During the Second World War, three films about Fuku-chan were made for propaganda purposes and in 1982 they were adapted into an anime television series. The character became the mascot of Waseda University.\nSynopsis\nThe series' protagonist is the five-year-old street boy Fukuo \u201cFuku-chan\u201d Fuchida, who mostly plays pranks on the people around him. Recurring characters include Fuku-chan's friend Kumi, playmate Namiko and her younger brother Kiyo, the cheeky twins Doshako and Garako, and Ganchan, who always annoys the other children at preschool.\nPublication\nThe character first appeared in Yokoyama's older series Edokko Ken-chan, where he appeared several times as a mischievous street boy and soon became more popular than the main character. Therefore, the Fuku-chan series started as a spin-off in the Asahi Shimbun in October 1936. It was published throughout the war and was only discontinued in 1971. During the war, some changes were made to conform to propaganda, for example, a \"Forward!\" was added to the title. In the post-war period, the illustrator was reprimanded by censors for his depiction of Americans with red noses.\nFilm adaptations\nA first adaptation of the comic strip as a film was published in 1941 as Fuku-chan no Kish\u016b. The film consisted of one reel of film and was probably a success, as the Navy Department subsequently commissioned the production of two more films that would focus on life at sea. Both propaganda films were released in 1944. The one-reel short film Uwanosora Hakase was made from a script by Yokoyama and directed by Maeda Hajime with a team of 18 over a period of eight months. It was a Navy Department co-production with Asahi Eigasha. The short film has not survived.\nThe second of the two films from 1944 is Fuku-chan no Sensuikan (English: \"Fuku-chan's Submarine\"), a five-reel work that was directed by Mochinaga Tadahito. No other people involved are known and there are conflicting reports about Yokoyama's involvement. For the production, the team was allowed to visit a naval base and a submarine and observe their crew. Some of the observations were incorporated into the film, for example in a cooking scene. A multiplan camera was constructed for production, but could only be used to a limited extent due to the general lack of material and employees.\nAn anime television series followed in 1982, directed by Mineo Fuji at Shin-Ei Animation. The screenplays were written by Masaki Tsuji, Toshiyuki Kashiwakura, Noboru Shiroyama and Hiroko Naka. The character design was created by Ryuichi Yokoyama. The 71 25-minute episodes were broadcast by TV Asahi from November 2, 1982, to March 27, 1984.\nDubbing\nMusic\nThe TV series' music was composed by Hiroshi Tsutsui. The opening song is Boku, Fuku-chan dai! by Chika Sakamoto.\nExternal links\nEntry at Anime News Network\n",

In an attempt to soothe the pain of the people affected by the Great Kanto Earthquake in September of that year and the chronic recession that preceded it, Tomoichir\u014d Takada, then editorial director of the Hochi Shimbun, considered serializing a cheerful comic strip in the paper and selected the work by As\u014d, a rookie comic strip artist. At the time, George McManus' Bringing Up Father, (serialized as Oyaji Kyoiku in Asahi Graph) was a popular comic strip, and Aso was reluctant to start serializing it, saying that he did not think he could compete with it in any way, but eventually accepted.\nAfter the serialization began, the circulation of Hochi Shimbun increased, and As\u014d became a popular manga artist. The color version of the book became a bestseller, and it became a social phenomenon at the end of the Taish\u014d era, with advertisements using characters and merchandise such as dolls and hand towels being created. It has even become a buzzword, with men with a carefree demeanor being called nontou (\u30ce\u30f3\u30c8\u30a6). In October 1926, the series ended temporarily due to As\u014d's trip to Europe. After returning to Japan, in 1929, serialization resumed under the title Zoku Nonkina tosan (\u7d9a\u30ce\u30f3\u30ad\u30ca\u30c8\u30a6\u30b5\u30f3)  in  the Yomiuri Sunday Manga page of the Sunday edition of Yomiuri Shimbun.\nFrom the November 26 issue of the same year, it was moved to the Yukan Hochi Shimbun, with the title changed to \u30ce\u30f3\u30ad\u30ca\u30c8\u30a6\u30b5\u30f3 and the format changed to a 4-panel comic, serialized every day on the top left of the front page. It seems that the panel layout, speech bubbles, and simplified character depictions were influenced by Bringing Up Father, and in the early serializations, the dialogue was written horizontally and in katakana. Over the course of the series, the panel layout changed from 2x2 to 1x4 vertically.\nAfter the war, in 1945, As\u014d serialized ``Nonkina tosan'' again in Daiichi Shimbun. As\u014d died in 1961, so the copyright ended before 2019, when the copyright was extended to 70 years after the author's death, and the work entered the public domain.\nFilms\nRy\u016bg\u016bmairi1925 Japanese film\nNonkina T\u014dsan ry\u016bg\u016bmairi ( \u30ce\u30f3\u30ad\u30ca\u30c8\u30a6\u30b5\u30f3 \u7adc\u5bae\u53c2\u308a; Carefree Dad's visit to Ry\u016bg\u016b palace ) is a Japanese short silent animated film produced and released in 1925.

In the segment, Brennan is invited as Partridge's doppelganger, but becomes unruly by insulting his host, gifting a tortoise (a protected species) and singing Irish Rebel Songs.\nThe sketch gained controversy in Britain when Coogan was perceived as mocking an Irish stereotype, as well as singing two rebel songs on mainstream British television. However, the performance was very well received in Ireland, with one critic writing that because Coogan is half Irish, Brennan could have become an \"offensive caricature\" but instead become an overnight \"social-media icon\". In an interview, Coogan said that played the character \"in such a way that it would empower Martin and disempower Alan.\"\nBrennan was revived in 2022 for Coogan's touring live show, where he appeared on an overhead screen to interact and sign with Partridge.\nSketch\nIn the skit, Partridge and his co-host Jennie (played by Susannah Fielding) interview Martin Brennan, also acted by Coogan, who had been invited onto the show as Partridge's doppelganger, and is presented as a farmer from County Sligo with bad teeth, gelled hair and a heavy brogue accent.\nThe interview quickly becomes unruly as Brennan claims to have never heard of Partridge until a few weeks ago\u2014he had been told that Partridge was a \"famous fella, used to be on the TV way back\", and says he responded to the request for an appearance by asking \"Who the hell is dat\". Brennan begins to sing \"When You Were Sweet Sixteen\", but controversially follows the rendition with segments of the Irish rebel songs \"Come Out, Ye Black and Tans\" and \"The Men Behind the Wire\", interrupting the show's planned closing montage of police dogs set to Duran Duran's \"Hungry Like the Wolf\". The political and incendiary lyrics of the rebel songs discomfort Partridge and the other hosts and guests. The piece ends with a visibly upset Partridge whispering to a producer into his microphone \"Oh my god that was like an advert for the IRA. Who are we going to blame? Find out who booked them and sack 'em.\"\nReception\nThe character has been described as the highlight of This Time and quickly became viral on social-media. The nuance behind the caricature of a West of Ireland bachelor farmer was widely praised by Irish critics and fans. Writing for the Irish Sunday Independent, the critic Pat Stacey titled his review of the episode \"This is what truly great, enduring comedy looks like\".\nThe sketch follows from a 1997 segment on \"I'm Alan Partridge\" where he meets with two Irish RT\u00c9 producers, played by the Father Ted writers Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan, where he says \"Sunday Bloody Sunday. What a great song. It really encapsulates the frustration of a Sunday, doesn\u2019t it?\" and remarking that \"Ireland has changed from its abiding image as a land of 'leprechauns, shamrock, Guinness, horses running through council estates, toothless simpletons, people with eyebrows on their cheeks, badly tarmacked drives, in , men in platform shoes being arrested for bombings, lots of rocks, and, uh, Beamish.\" He finishes by saying in a mock Irish accent that \"I think people are saying, there\u2019s more to Ireland than this. Good slogan for the tourist board. 'Dere\u2019s more teh Oireland dan dis!'\".\nSteve Coogan in 2005\nCoogan, who was born and raised in Manchester to Irish parents, defended the controversial aspects of the character saying that \"the decisions I make on comedy aren't made on a whim. That whole history between the British and the Irish runs through me. My mother grew up in Mayo and I spent all my summers there\". In contemporary interviews he says that he grew up hearing Irishman jokes and told \"a few\" himself, clarifying that \"all that stuff is important to me. There is a strange thing going on in Ireland with the younger people saying: this is our country.\" He further said that although singing Republican songs on prime time British television had been a comedic goal of his for a number of years, partly born of \"mischief\", he was unsure how it would be taken, and was glad when his mother (Kathleen, n\u00e9e Coonan) \"was relieved that people thought it was great.\"\n",
    "American golfer (1942\u20132022)\nTerry Wayne Forcum (May 4, 1942 \u2013 July 26, 2022) was an American golfer who competed as a professional long drive athlete, winning the World Championship in 1983.\nPersonal life\nForcum was born in Downey, California, and attended high school in Ponca City, Oklahoma, graduating in 1960.  After high school he competed on the rodeo circuit as a bull rider for four years. In 1964 he was drafted into the United States Army and served two years in Wurzburg, Germany. While serving overseas, Forcum competed in football, baseball, boxing and golf.  After returning to the States, he attended the University of Houston and opened a welding shop in Ponca City, Oklahoma, but continued playing sports recreationally.\nLong drive career\nForcum first picked up a golf club when he was 10 years old. By age 14-15 he realized that he could hit a golf ball an exceptionally long distance.  He played on the junior high golf team in Ponca City, but opted to play baseball instead in high school. He played in amateur golf tournaments in the 1960s and became a professional golfer in 1975.  Competing in the US National Long Drive Championship, he won 6th place in 1976, 2nd place in 1982, 1st place in 1983 (becoming at age 41 the oldest to do so), and 3rd place in 1988.  His 1983 1st place win at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, California earned him the title of World Long Drive Champion for that year \u2013 see World Long Drive Championship Winners.  By 1990, he had finished in the top 10 in long drive competitions in eight of the 10 previous years.  He competed in his last National Long Drive Championship in 2008 at the age of 66.\nHis longest competition drive was 369 yards at a competition held in Tokyo, Japan.  He hit a 427-yard drive at a Professional Golfers Association clinic, and his longest recorded drive ever was 547 yards at the Lakeside Golf Course in Ponca City.  He could hit a ball up to 300 yards out of a tee box with a 4 wood, 257 yards with a 7 iron, and once hit a 361-yard drive while on his knees.  He was also known for hitting \"stunt shots\" that included driving a ball through a piece of plywood, and hitting a ball out of a person's mouth.\nA founding member of the 350 Club, the original group of long drivers who toured the world putting on exhibitions and clinics, the Pro Long Drive Association lists him as a pioneer of the long drive sport.\nForcum died in Wichita, Kansas at the age of 80.\n",
    "Kwena pretender\nMoruakgomo Sechele was a pretender of the Kwena tribe as the son of kgosi Sebele II. His claim to be kgosi was widely supported in 1962, but it was challenged by his cousin Bonewamang. A court decision disqualified both of them despite acknowledging their claims.\nEarly life\nMoruakgomo Sechele was born in Ghanzi to Sebele II, exiled kgosi of the Kwena tribe, and his wife Susan. His year of birth has been reported as 1932 and 1934. Moruakgomo and his younger brother Mokgalagadi were Sebele's only male heirs. In 1940, Moruakgomo and his siblings were baptised in the Anglian church in Molepolole. Sebele died in 1939, and the family moved to Tlokweng where Susan's parents lived. As the son of an exiled leader, Moruakgomo became a pretender after his father's death.\nSuccession dispute\nA succession dispute began when Bakwena kgosi Kgari Sechele II died without an heir in 1962. Moruakgomo was considered a possible successor as his father had been the previous kgosi. His supporters made up a majority of the tribe, and they became known as the letsomane letona (transl.\u2009big flock). Among them were interim chief Kenalekgosi and the two living sons of Sechele II, MacIntyre and Mosarwa.\nMoruakgomo's claim was challenged by his cousin Bonewamang, whose father Padi had previously been passed over in the line of succession. Moruakgomo's opponents disliked that his mother was a Coloured woman, and they alleged that Susan had never formally been wed to Sebele, which would make her a concubine who could not produce an heir. Kgari had previously made such allegations as kgosi, but they were unfounded. His detractors also feared that growing up away from the Bakwena would affect his ability to rule and that allowing the child of a polygamous marriage to rule would threaten Christian ideas of marriage. The British colonial administration, citing the 1943 Native Administration Proclamation, sent the dispute to the High Court. In February 1963, it ruled that Moruakgomo was next in line, but that both claimants would be passed over in favour of a compromise candidate, Neale Sechele.\nMoruakgomo died in 1979. His brother Mokgalagadi initiated a legal challenge to have them recognised as the rightful successors in 1999. Mokgalagadi's son Kealeboga continued the challenge after Mokgalagadi's death the following year, but Kgari Sechele III became kgosi in 2002.\nNotes\n^ a b c d e Mbuya 1999, p.\u00a071.\n^ a b c Morton & Ramsay 2018.\n^ Ramsay 1996, p.\u00a077.\n^ a b c d e Ramsay 1996, p.\u00a078.\n^ Mbuya 1999, p.\u00a072.\n^ a b Ramsay 1996, pp.\u00a078\u201379.\n^ Ramsay 1996, p.\u00a079.\n^ Nyamnjoh 2003, p.\u00a0243.\n",
    "Gustave Dor\u00e9 pictures the stag nibbling the vine as the hunting hounds close in, 1867\nThe stag (hart, hind or deer) and the vine is a formerly popular and widely translated fable by Aesop. It is numbered 77 in the Perry Index. \nThe fable and its history\nA deer pursued by hunters hides among the vines. While there, it nibbles the leaves of the plant and so betrays its presence to the hunters, who return and kill it. The dying deer acknowledges the righteousness of the divine punishment for ingratitude to its benefactor. The fable has remained more or less unchanged in form since its first appearance in Greek sources.\nFrom the 16th century the fable was frequently retold in Europe. Gabriele Faerno included a Latin poetic version titled Cerva et vitis in his Centum Fabulae (1563), a work that soon became a widely distributed school textbook with a French verse translation. In that century too the fable was taken to Mexico by Spanish colonialists, who translated it into the Aztec language and had to coin the word for 'vineyard' specially from Nahuatl, since plantations had only recently been introduced by the European invaders. Later in the Far East, Portuguese priests related the story in their Japanese compilation of Aesop's Fables, Esopo no Fabulas (1593).\nIn 1666 La Fontaine included the story in the first volume of his fables under the title Le cerf et la vigne, and the story was translated back into Latin verse by J. B. Giraud in his schoolbook of 1775. Then in the following century, another Latin poetic version of the original fable was published in a schoolbook \"intended as a help towards original composition\".\nOne of the earliest English prose versions of the story was titled \"The Hind and the Vine\" and included in Charles Hoole's Aesop's Fables English and Latin (1700). Shortly afterwards it was retold in verse at the end of an essay on ingratitude by Arthur Maynwaring. 18th century compilers of fables retitled the story \"The Hart and the Vine\" and accompanied it with lengthy moral commentaries. By the 19th century that title had become \"The Stag and the Vine\" in a short poem by Brooke Boothby and in Elizur Wright's US translation of La Fontaine's fables.\nMuch earlier, Roger L'Estrange had included the fable in his collection of 1692, accompanied by a political reflexion that alluded to the civil conflicts between monarch and parliament in which he had participated earlier in the century. However, the title of \"The Goat and the Vine\" that he gave it properly belongs to a completely different fable by Aesop in which retribution is threatened but is slower to follow. \n",
    "\nThe siege of Yerevan was a military engagement of the Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1623\u20131639). During this siege, the Ottoman Empire occupied the city of Yerevan.\nSiege\nThe conflict with the Ottomans Shah Abbas had started and continued after his death in 1629 under the leadership of his grandson Shah Safi. Eager to prevent further losses against the Safavids, the Ottoman sultan, Murad IV, began preparing for a long campaign to invade the Safavid territory in 1635. Throughout the campaign, he executed those who neglected their duties, as well as highway robbers and bandits. The Ottoman army arrived in the city of Yerevan on July 26.\nThe Sultan establishes his camp on H\u00fcnk\u00e2r Hill, where he is able to see the city clearly. On July 29, the Ottomans placed their cannons on the hill overlooking the castle and began bombarding the walls. The bombing caused casualties and damaged not only the walls but also the houses within. The next day, the Janisseries attacked the barricades of the Safavids, but despite intense bombardment, which inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, the Ottomans successfully captured their barricades. In order to keep the Ottoman troops morale high, the Sultan personally took care of the wounded and checked their conditions.\nThe Ottomans kept bombarding the city constantly, and on August 2, the Safavids launched a sortie against the Rumelian soldiers. Even though it was an organized attack, they were repelled and compelled to retreat behind the walls. The garrison did not dare to go out in offense after this. The Safavid commander, Emirg\u00fbneo\u011flu Tahmasp Kuli, dispatched his lieutenant, Murad Agha, to negotiate with the grand vizier, Taban\u0131yass\u0131 Mehmed Pasha, who showed him to the Sultan and offered him the castle in exchange for their lives, to which he agreed. On August 8, the Safavids ceded the city.\nAftermath\nEmirg\u00fbneo\u011flu Tahmasp Kuli joined the Ottomans and became a Sunni Muslim alongside Murad Agha. He would change his name to Yusuf Pasha and be appointed governor of Aleppo. The Sultan left Yerevan and headed towards Tabriz 13 days later. He captured the city and laid waste to it. After the arrival of winter and the Safavids avoiding battles, the Ottomans returned to Istanbul. Murad had the Yerevan Kiosk in the Topkap\u0131 Palace built to commemorate his victory at Yerevan.\n",
    "\n2023 single by Paula Toledo\n\"How Long\", also released as \"How Long (Will It Take)\", is a song recorded by the Canadian singer Paula Toledo around 2003, known for being considered a piece of lost media for sixteen years. Initially, the track was not released commercially, being only licensed to appear in the film Secret Lives and the TV series 15/Love in 2005. Two years later, a user posted online about a bootleg DVD that contained a snippet of the song, prompting a search for the track's origin that attracted the attention of the lostwave community. In December 2023, the song's origin was discovered, and Toledo released it as a single that same month in response. Musically, the track was compared to the Cranberries.\nBackground and composition\nPaula Toledo is an artist, songwriter, and motivational speaker. She grew up in Montreal before relocating to Vancouver for college. Toledo recorded \"How Long\" in Langley, British Columbia, around 2003. The song was co-produced by Jonathan Anderson of the Canadian band Jonathan Inc., and guitarist David Odlum of the Irish band the Frames mixed it in France. While the song was initially written for her debut studio album, it was not included there. Despite this, it was well-liked in her setlists. After a show at a neighborhood restaurant, an employee from Lionsgate Entertainment inquired about licensing the song. In 2005, it was licensed for Secret Lives, a made-for-TV film, and 15/Love, a youth sitcom. Because of this, and for \"artistic reasons\", Toledo also did not include the song in her extended play. Toledo left the music field after she became a single mother due to the death of her husband.\n\"How Long\"\n\"How Long\" speaks to living authentically. It was musically compared to the Cranberries, and was noted for its guitar usage.\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\nToledo wrote \"How Long\" from her personal perspective, and believes it resonates with modern audiences because it conveys the importance of living authentically. A four-minute song, it was musically compared to the Irish band the Cranberries. Miles Klee of Rolling Stone and V. S. Wells of The Georgia Straight described it as a \"yearning\" track. Klee described it as jangle rock, while Wells perceived inspiration from 1980s rock and early 2000s \"guitar-driven pop\". Jon Azpiri of CBC News felt that the song would fit well with modern adult contemporary radio and film soundtracks, due to the \"wistful\" vocals of Toledo and the guitar usage. Toledo tagged the song's Bandcamp release under folk rock, indie folk, and indie pop.\nSearch and discovery\n\"How Long\" was first mentioned online in August 2007, when a user on a Ukrainian forum mentioned that a snippet of the song was featured on the menu of a bootleg Russian DVD. A small group of fans formed to uncover the song's origin. Only a low-quality, 45-second snippet of the song's chorus was available. The search became popular in the lostwave community, which is dedicated to trying to identify the provenance of songs considered unknown or lost. Because the song was never released commercially, it was not possible to find it through Google or apps like Shazam. Fans initially named the song \"How Long It Will Take\", based on a line from the chorus. Some people made tribute videos for \"How Long\" featuring images of teddy bears, while others created remixes and covers of the song. Additionally, video essays were made about the mystery. In October 2023, a subreddit, r/HLWIT, was created, named after the initials of the unofficial title, and had one thousand members by December.\nOn December 8, 2023, sixteen years after \"How Long\" was first mentioned on the Internet, Reddit user the-arabara posted that he had found the song's origin. Initially, he tried to find the creators of the DVDs, \"track down a movie mentioned on a job application\", and found another obscure song in its credits. Ultimately, he found the track when searching for songs titled \"How Long\" on the Society of Composer, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada's database. This led him to another Reddit post and ultimately to a podcast containing the full song. Reddit users commemorated the discovery on r/HLWIT.\nThat same day, Toledo got multiple emails about the discovery, which surprised her; she initially believed the messages to be scams. In response, she released the full version of \"How Long\" on Bandcamp on December 13. All proceeds from the song's sales in 2023 went to the Music Heals Charitable Foundation, which supports and raises awareness of music therapy. Later, Toledo released the song on streaming services, including Spotify and Apple Music. However, as a result of a duplicate, unofficial version of the song appearing on streaming platforms, the official version was taken down, which she suspected to be because of streaming fraud. In May 2024, the song was officially reuploaded to streaming services under the title \"How Long (Will It Take)\".\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the 2023 release on Bandca",
    "1707 hymn by Isaac Watts\n\"Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed\" is a hymn by Isaac Watts, first published in 1707. The words describe the crucifixion of Jesus and reflect on an appropriate personal response to this event. The hymn is commonly sung with a refrain added in 1885 by Ralph E. Hudson; when this refrain is used, the hymn is sometimes known as \"At the Cross\". The final line of the first stanza has attracted some criticism, as it describes the singer as a \"worm\". Hymnals often change the line from \"for such a worm as I\" to \"for such a one as I\" or \"for sinners such as I.\"\nHistory\nOriginal composition\n\"Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed\" was originally published in 1707, in Hymns and Spiritual Songs, which was the first collection of hymns by the prolific English hymnwriter Isaac Watts. This anthology was published in three volumes; \"Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed\" was included in volume 2. This volume comprised songs \"Composed on Divine Subjects\", and the hymn was given the heading \"Godly sorrow arising from the Sufferings of Christ.\"\nThe traditional words have commonly been paired with the hymn tune Martyrdom, which is an adaptation of a traditional Scottish melody, attributed to Hugh Wilson. The hymn has been more popular in the USA and Canada than in the UK; in North America, it is one of the most-sung hymns by Isaac Watts.\n\"At the Cross\"\nIn the context of late 19th-century revivalism, this became one of a number of traditional hymns that were turned into gospel songs with the addition of a chorus. In 1885, songwriter Ralph E. Hudson added a repeated refrain in his hymnbook Songs of Peace, Love, and Joy. This refrain has been included in many hymnals:\nAt the cross, at the cross,\nWhere I first saw the light,\nAnd the burden of my heart rolled away,\nIt was there by faith I received my sight,\nAnd now I am happy all the day!\nThe words and music of this refrain probably originated in camp meetings of the time. When this chorus is included, the hymn is often known as \"At the Cross.\" Hudson also wrote a new tune in a gospel style for the verses; this tune is known as Hudson. The refrain has sometimes been added to other hymns as well, or included in hymnbooks as a standalone chorus.\nText\nOriginal words\nThe original hymn had six four-line stanzas.\nAlas! and did my Saviour bleed,\n\u00a0\u00a0And did my sov\u2019reign die?\nWould he devote that sacred Head\n\u00a0\u00a0For such a Worm as I?\nThy Body slain, sweet Jesus, thine,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And bath\u2019d in its own Blood,\nWhile all expos\u2019d to Wrath divine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The glorious Sufferer stood?\nWas it for Crimes that I had done\n\u00a0\u00a0He groan\u2019d upon the Tree?\nAmazing Pity! Grace unknown!\n\u00a0\u00a0And Love beyond Degree?\nWell might the Sun in Darkness hide,\n\u00a0\u00a0And shut his Glories in,\nWhen God the mighty Maker died\n\u00a0\u00a0For Man the Creatures Sin.\nThus might I hide my blushing Face\n\u00a0\u00a0While his dear Cross appears,\nDissolve my Heart in Thankfulness,\n\u00a0\u00a0And melt mine Eyes to Tears.\nBut Drops of Grief can ne\u2019er repay\n\u00a0\u00a0The Debt of Love I owe;\nHere, Lord, I give my self away,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2019Tis all that I can do.\nAnalysis\nThe hymn words centre on the Crucifixion of Jesus, and the opening verses offer a concise summary of the doctrine of penal substitution. This doctrine is approached from a personal and emotional perspective, leading to a reflection on the appropriate response to Jesus' death. In the Canterbury Dictionary of Hymnology, Alan Gaunt describes it as \"one of Watts's most intense lyric poems,\" which \"emphasises the emotional effect on the writer and the reader/singer.\" According to Leland Ryken, the hymn contains the \"speaker's thought process as he comes to grips with the crucifixion and what it means for him\", and invites the singer to \"enact the same thought process.\" Comparing this hymn with another well-known Isaac Watts hymn, \"When I Survey the Wondrous Cross\", Carl P. Daw Jr. notes that where the latter is \"objective and sweeping; this one is subjective and tightly focused.\"\nAlterations\nHymn books commonly omit the second stanza, which is described as an optional verse in the originally published version. In Salvation Army hymn books, the line \"God the mighty Maker\" in stanza four is changed to \"Christ the mighty maker.\"\nAs well as the refrain included by Ralph E. Hudson, other hymn books have added a chorus to the hymn. Charles Price Jones, founder of the Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A., added the following refrain:\nI surrendered at the cross,\nand my heart was cleansed from sin\nBy the precious blood the Savior shed for me;\nI am living in His word, and it daily keeps me clean!\nHallelujah, from the pow'r of sin I'm freed.\nIn the 1986 Song Book of the Salvation Army, the added refrain was:\nRemember me, remember me,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O Lord, remember me;\nRemember, Lord, thy dying groans,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then remember me.\n\"For such a worm as I\"\nThe final line of the first stanza (\"for such a worm as I\") is amended in many hymnals. Sometimes, the word \"worm\" is changed to \"one\" or more commonly, the line is altered to \"sinners such as I\".\nThe original li",
    "Flag of the Brazilian state of Par\u00e1\nThe flag of the state of Par\u00e1 is, along with the coat of arms and the anthem, one of the symbols of the state of Par\u00e1, Brazil as described in article 12 of the state constitution.\nHistory\nOne day after joining the nation of Brazil on November 16, 1889, as well as in its initial years, the flag of the Clube Republicano Paraense appeared as the state flag. Written by Philadelpho de Oliveira Condur\u00fa, it was described as follows:\nBandeira partida em pala, de vermelho, branco, vermelho com uma estrela azul no centro.\nOn April 10, 1890, the Municipal Council, on the proposal of its president, Artur \u00cdndio do Brasil, approved a project making the club's badge the flag of the municipality of Bel\u00e9m.\nOn June 3, 1890, a bill to make the flag official was presented by deputy Higino Amanaj\u00e1s in the State Chamber. Its content was as follows:\nThe Legislative Congress of the State of Par\u00e1 decrees:\nArt. 1 - The Flag of the State of Par\u00e1 is considered to be the one that served as a badge for the Clube Republicano Paraense, before the proclamation of the Republic, and which in a session on April 10, 1890 was adopted as the Flag of the Municipality.\nArt. 2 \u2014 Provisions to the contrary are renewed.Ribeiro records that the project was never made official, being rejected in the senate, inspired by Governor Augusto Montenegro, on the grounds that all Brazilians should have the Brazilian flag as their only flag.\nThe current design of the flag, which was used as a reference in the creation of the official coat of arms in 1903, is composed as follows: a red rectangle with an oblique white stripe, running from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, and a blue star in the center of the flag.\nSymbolism\nFlag of the Clube Republicano Paraense\nThe white stripe in the Flag of Par\u00e1 represents the zodiac, the Equator and the Amazon River. The blue star is Spica in the constellation Virgo, which is also depicted on the Flag of Brazil representing the state. The two red areas symbolize the blood shed by the Cabanos in the Cabanagem revolt.\nThe star symbolizes the state, which on the national flag corresponds to Espiga, the alpha star of the first magnitude in the constellation Virgo. In the Brazilian pavilion, it is the only star above the banner with the banner \"Order and Progress\" because, at the time of the proclamation of the Republic, it was the state whose capital, Bel\u00e9m, was the northernmost in the country. Another statement as to why the star is lonely was because the state was the last province to accept Brazil's independence from Portugal.\n",

'Palace Lady Liu';\u00a0? \u2015\u00a0?) was a concubine of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty in China. She was the mother of Emperor Gaozong's eldest son, Li Zhong, who later became the crown prince of the Tang dynasty. Despite her low birth, her son became the crown prince. It was rare for a prince of such low birth, the son of a palace maid, to be appointed crown prince.\nLife\nWhile Lady Liu's personal background and the circumstances surrounding her entry into the imperial palace remain unclear, historical records indicate that she was a palace maid of Prince Li Zhi (later Emperor Gaozong) and held the title of \"concubine\" (fei), a rank within the imperial harem.\nIn the year 643 CE, during the 17th year of the Zhenguan reign, shortly after ascending to the position of crown prince, Li Zhi had his first son with her, Li Zhong. Emperor Taizong, the reigning emperor and Li Zhi's father, expressed his elation by declaring, \"Upon receiving this grandson, I want to share the joy with everyone,\" and he was so happy that he started dancing.\nFollowing the birth of her son, Lady Liu's presence in historical records fades away. There is no mention of whether she received any further titles or honors after Emperor Gaozong's ascension to the throne.\nIn the absence of a male heir, Empress Wang, Emperor Gaozong's empress, faced pressure to secure the succession. Her uncle, the chancellor Liu Shi, suggested adopting Li Zhong as the crown prince because Lady Liu came from a lowly background, and Liu Shi hoped Li Zhong would be close to Empress Wang. Thus, Li Zhong was made the crown prince. This proposal likely stemmed from Liu Shi's hope that Li Zhong's elevation would strengthen his own position and influence within the court. Later, after Emperor Gaozong deposed Empress Wang and established his concubine Wu Zetian as empress, Li Zhong was demoted to the Prince of Liang. However, due to political maneuvering and favoritism, Emperor Gaozong eventually designated his third son, Li Hong, as the crown prince and successor to the throne.\nIn media\nPortrayed by Jian Lifang in 1985 Chinese drama The Empress of the Dynasty\nPortrayed by Cui Bing in 2014 Chinese drama The Empress of China\n",

    "German football club\nFootball club\nBlau-Wei\u00df Br\u00fchl (officially known as Fu\u00dfballclub Blau-Wei\u00df Br\u00fchl 1949 e.V.) was a football club from the town of Br\u00fchl in the Rhineland region of Germany. The club's first team participated in the DFB-Pokal in 2001.\nHistory\nThe football club was founded in 1949 and for many decades played at the district level. In 2000, the club achieved promotion to the district league for the first time, followed by a rapid ascent to the Landesliga Mittelrhein (Mittelrhein League). In 2001, under the guidance of coach Nissim Beniesch, Blau-Wei\u00df Br\u00fchl reached the final of the Mittelrheinpokal (Mittelrhein Cup) and defeated the reserves of Bayer 04 Leverkusen in the process. On May 24, 2001, they won the final against Borussia Freialdenhoven with a score of 3\u20132. This made the team the first seventh-tier club to qualify for the DFB-Pokal 2001/02. In the DFB-Pokal, Blau-Wei\u00df Br\u00fchl, now playing at the sixth-tier level due to their previous promotion, faced Bundesliga side 1. FC Kaiserslautern and lost 1\u20134 after initially taking a 1\u20130 lead in front of approximately 6,000 spectators.\nSubsequently, Blau-Wei\u00df Br\u00fchl achieved another promotion to the Verbandsliga Mittelrhein (Mittelrhein Association League) in the league competition. However, in the 2002/03 season, the team narrowly avoided relegation, and a year later, they finished in last place and were relegated back to the Landesliga. The merger of TuRa Hennef with FC Geistingen to form FC Hennef 05 prevented Br\u00fchl from being relegated to the Bezirksliga. Nonetheless, they were eventually relegated to that league in 2006 due to sporting reasons. With the absence of sporting success and further relegations to the Kreisliga A and Kreisliga B in 2008, Blau-Wei\u00df Br\u00fchl also lost important players and officials.\nIn the 2008/09 season, the team was withdrawn from competitive play and the club was ultimately dissolved. This development was facilitated by the simultaneous success of local rivals SC Br\u00fchl 06/45, who achieved promotion to the fifth-tier Mittelrheinliga in 2008.\nHonors\nWinner of the Middle Rhine Cup in 2001\nNotable personalities\nFuat K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\nWolodymyr Ljutyj\nMohamed Azima\n",
    "UNESCO World Heritage Site in Tatarstan, Russia\nAstronomical Observatory of Kazan University is a Russian astronomical observatory located in the city of Kazan at an altitude of 75 meters above sea level. It exists on the basis of the Department of Astronomy of Kazan University, founded in 1810 by Joseph Johann von Littrow. Object of cultural heritage of Russia of federal significance. On September 19, 2023, the observatory was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\nHistory\nThe Department of Astronomy of the Imperial Kazan University was founded in 1810 by Joseph Johann Litrow. On November 11, 1814, observations began at a small observatory (temporary construction) above a stone gatehouse in the university botanical garden. In 1822 the observatory was temporarily placed in a wooden gallery (part of I. M. Simonov's apartment). In 1827 the university yard was chosen as the permanent place of the observatory, and in 1833 the construction of the observatory building began. In 1835 a 23-cm (9-inch) refractor was ordered from Fraunhofer's workshop.\nIn 1837 the permanent observatory building was completed, and in June of that year the first observations were made in it. In 1838, a 9-inch refractor was installed in the fully movable main tower. The official date of birth of the University Astronomical Observatory was April 13, 1838, when permanent observations (on the Vienna Meridian Circle) began in the new observatory building.\nOn February 23, 1885, a time service was established: a clock showing the exact Kazan mean time was exhibited in the window of the department.\nFrom 1925 to 1946, along with the Department of Astronomy, there was the Department of Geodesy, from 1937 called the Department of Geodesy and Gravimetry. It was headed at different times by K. K. Dubrovsky (1925\u20131931), A. A. Yakovkin (1931\u20131937), I. A. Dyukov (1937\u20131941), A. D. Dubyago (1941\u20131946). The Department of Astronomy since the late 30s was called the Department of Astrometry (heads V. A. Baranov (1937\u20131941), I. A. Dyukov (1941\u20131947)).\nIn addition, from 1939 to 1947 and then from 1951 to 1954 there was the Department of Astrophysics under the direction of D. Y. Martynov, and since 1945 - the Department of Theoretical Astronomy under the direction of A. D. Dubyago. In 1947, due to the insufficient number of students, four astronomy departments were merged into one - the Department of Astronomy under the general direction of Prof. I. A. Dyukov/\nOn May 4, 1983, in Kazan, V. Kapkov made a successful observation of the occultation of an 8.6 magnitude star by asteroid 2 Pallas. This was the first reliable observation of an asteroid occulting a star on the territory of Russia and the fourth within the borders of the USSR.\nOn September 19, 2023, the observatory was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n",
    "Spanish  boxer, professional wrestler, and football manager\nAndr\u00e9s Balsa Ant\u00f3n (11 March 1883 \u2013 16 December 1973) was a Spanish boxer, professional wrestler, and football manager, taking charge over Celta de Vigo, Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, and Valencia CF in the 1920s and 1930s.\nEarly life\nAndr\u00e9s Balsa was born on 11 March 1883 in Mugardos, A Coru\u00f1a, as the son of a humble farmer and grandson of a single mother, and his childhood was spent like that of all the children in his town, working very hard and going through hardships. Unlike the others, however, he eventually outgrew all of them, being six feet tall with its corresponding tonnage, a giant between sizes of 1,65.\nFighting career\nBalsa wanted to see the world and get to know America, so he enlisted in the merchant marine, and from the decks of those ships, he learned to fight and carry out night skirmishes as entertainment in the usual impasses of such long voyages. In a stop in Acapulco, he accompanied the ship's skipper to a regular inn in which he attended an evening of freestyle wrestling, one of those shows where at the end of it, the champion would challenge someone in the audience to last fifteen minutes in a match against him in exchange for a thousand pesos, and at the insistence of his boss, Balsa agreed to fight with the condition of not being abandoned if he were injured or badly off. Balsa easily defeated the Mexican long before the time ran out, at which point he left the navy by letting the ship sail, and began fighting by investing his prize in training in the free and pugilistic arts. He trained under an English champion, a Jack Nelson, who introduced him to the official circuit around 1909, taking him on tour through Panama and Cuba, where he defeated tough opponents in boxing matches, such as the German champion in Havana.\nWith about two meters of height, one hundred and twenty kilos of weight, and a strength that the media of the time considered \"herculean\", Balsa entered the world of wrestling, fighting throughout the continent, competing from the United States to Peru, Cuba, and Argentina with a large percentage of victories and earning money. However, it was a bittersweet glory, since his way of dancing on stage was considered unorthodox for purists, fuel for their ridicule, with \"he lacks any technique\" being the usual tagline that accompanied his triumphs, and even in the Spanish press, which echoed his victories in the United States and Cuba, his successes came with the same words.\nBalsa, who styled himself as El Moderno Ursus, as well as Italian strongman Romulus (Cosimo Molino), featured bull wrestling in their acts. Due to his fame, he participated in the Italian film Quo Vadis? directed by Enrico Guazzoni, receiving $5,000 to play the role of Ursus, which was attributed to Bruto Castellani who repeated the role in the 1924 version. He can also be seen in the skin of a gladiator in other famous films like Ben-Hur.\nBalsa participated in several wrestling competitions and in 1915, while Europe was bleeding to death in the Great War, he defeated the Japanese Taro Miyake in a fight for the world wrestling title. After fighting in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, and Liverpool, he returned to Galicia at the end of the War, arriving in the port of Vigo on 1 July 1920 aboard the steamer Desna, received with praise of crowds.\nConfident in his abilities, Balsa decided to make the leap into the competitive world of boxing, going to New York to compete for the world heavyweight title in 1921, but was defeated by Jack Dempsey, who would remain champion uninterruptedly until 1926. In the build-up for this challenge, he won a match with such a taste of triumph that the bruised American begged him to be his trainer. He is still remembered today in America by literature thanks to his fight against Dempsey, while no one remembers him in his native Galicia. This was the highest moment in his boxing career, but also the beginning of a physical decline that would lead him to a series of strong defeats with boxers of not very high category in 1925. Ahead of his last boxing match, Balsa was still weighing the KO from the Belgian Jack Humbeeck a few days earlier, and his 40 years of flesh and muscle weighed much more, and thus he barely lasted two rounds against Jos\u00e9 Santa, a weak Portuguese who came from sparring, just so that \"H\u00e9rcules\" could have some joy.\nManagerial career\nFrom the age of 40, his ability as a fighter began to diminish, so Balsa hung his gloves and announced himself as a physical culture teacher in his gym in Vigo, but he also began the fight of getting into the world of a sport that had been attracting his attention for a long time, football. At the time, it was inappropriate for footballers to dedicate time to training the body, and in this, Balsa found refuge from a life of retirement that used to bring times of famine to former boxers like him. In 1926 he joined the technical staff of Celta de Vigo as a physical trai",

    "Charles Bayard Lister (July 4, 1898 \u2013 May 14, 1951) was an American firearms expert who was an officer of the National Rifle Association of America from 1926 to 1951.\nEarly life\nLister was born on July 4, 1898, in Wilmington, Delaware to James W. and Florence (Carson) Lister. He became involved in sports shooting while a member of the Boy Scouts of America. After graduating from Wilmington High School, he worked under Kellogg Casey in the sales and promotions department of DuPont. In 1917, Lister joined the United States Army and remained there until the end of World War I. On October 22, 1919, he married Lynette Harper. They had one daughter.\nNational Rifle Association\nIn 1921, Lister moved to Washington D.C. to become the advertising and promotion manager of the National Rifle Association. He recommended expanding NRA membership outside the United States Armed Forces and state militias and under his leadership, membership grew from 3,500 in 1921 to over 10,000 in 1925.\nIn 1926, he became the organization's secretary\u2013treasurer and led a drive that increased membership to 350,000 by 1945. He also served as editor of the NRA's monthly magazine, the American Rifleman, was a contributor to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, and edited the sections on rifles and marksmanship in Webster's International Dictionary. He was a leader in the fight against laws restricting firearm ownership, but did support some gun control measurers, including the National Firearms Act and the Federal Firearms Act of 1938.\nDue to a prior bout of tuberculosis, Lister was rejected for active military service during World War II. He instead served as the national coordinator of rifle shooting in the Office of Civilian Defense. He also helped draft the first manual on home guard organization.\nIn 1949, Lister succeeded the retiring Milton Reckord as executive director of the NRA. He died of brain cancer on May 14, 1951, at the Washington Sanitarium. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\nFollowing his death, a memorial trophy was presented. Since 1952 it has been awarded for the National Indoor Sectional-National Smallbore Rifle Champion.\n",
    "Obsolete size class of laptops\nThe NEC UltraLite defined the modern notebook on its release in 1988.\nA notebook computer or notebook was historically a laptop whose length and width approximate that of letter paper (8.5 by 11 inches or 220 by 280 millimetres).\nThe term notebook was coined to describe slab-like portable computers that had a letter-paper footprint, such as Epson's HX-20 and Tandy's TRS-80 Model 100 of the early 1980s. The popularity of this form factor waned in the middle of the decade, as larger, clamshell-style laptops offered far more capability. In 1988, NEC's UltraLite defined a new category of notebook: it achieved IBM PC compatibility, making it technically as versatile as the largest laptops, while occupying a letter-paper footprint in a clamshell case. A handful of computer manufacturers followed suit with their own notebooks, including Compaq, whose successful LTE achieved full feature parity with laptops and spurred many others to produce their own notebooks. By 1991, the notebook industry was in full swing.\nNotebooks and laptops occupied distinct market segments into the mid-1990s, but customer preference for larger screens led to notebooks converging with laptops in the late 1990s. Since the early 2000s, the terms laptop and notebook are used interchangeably, irrespective of physical dimensions, with laptop being the more common term in English-speaking territories.\nEtymology\nThe Epson HX-20 from 1982 was the first portable computer to be called a \"notebook\".\nThe terms laptop and notebook both trace their origins to the early 1980s, coined to describe portable computers in a size class smaller than the contemporary mainstream units (so-called \"luggables\") but larger than pocket computers. The etymologist William Safire traced the origin of laptop to some time before 1984; the earliest attestation of laptop found by the Oxford English Dictionary dates to 1983. The word is modeled after the term desktop, as in desktop computer. Notebook, meanwhile, emerged earlier in 1982 to describe Epson's HX-20 portable, whose dimensions roughly correspond to a letter-sized pad of paper.:\u200a9\u200a\nHistory\nIn the mid-1980s, notebooks and laptops came to represent differing form factors of portable computer in the technology press, with notebooks possessing simplified hardware and a slab-like appearance with exposed keyboard (typified by the HX-20 and the TRS-80 Model 100); and laptops possessing more advanced hardware and a clamshell case to protect the keyboard. These early notebooks were all but discontinued by 1987, with laptops gaining favor due to their increased versatility.\nThe Sharp PC-4641, a laptop released in the same month as the UltraLite. Larger laptops continued to be marketed alongside notebooks for several years.\nBy this point, however, laptops were gaining hardware features faster than the industry could miniaturize their parts, leading to very heavy laptops\u2014some upwards of 20 pounds (9.1\u00a0kg).:\u200a16\u200a In October 1988, NEC released the UltraLite, the first notebook-sized clamshell laptop compatible with the IBM PC. The term notebook was promptly revived by journalists to describe the new class of laptop that the UltraLite had invented.:\u200a16\u200a Competitors soon came out with competing models, and while initial entries like the UltraLite made concessions in terms of data storage compatibility, Compaq's LTE line of notebooks in 1989 was the first to have full feature parity with the heaviest laptops of the time and jumpstarted the industry for these new notebooks, with scores of other manufacturers announcing their own notebooks. In direct response to Compaq,:\u200a59\u200a:\u200a75\u200a both Apple and IBM, top players in the computer industry, made their hotly anticipated entries in the notebook market in 1991, respectively, with the PowerBook and the PS/2 Note (a predecessor to the ThinkPad). Under the aegis of the Industrial Technology Research Institute, dozens of Taiwanese computer manufacturers formed a consortium to mass manufacture notebook computers starting in 1991. These Taiwanese notebook computers soon flooded the West, bringing the cost of notebooks down on the low end of the market.\nLaptops and notebooks continued to occupy discrete market segments into the mid-1990s, with unit sales tracked separately by research firms such as Dataquest. Notebooks were seen as having a footprint exactly that of or smaller than letter paper (8.5 by 11 inches or 22 by 28 centimetres), while laptops were larger. This distinction was considered important to business buyers, whose attach\u00e9 cases often had a compartment exactly that size. An additional distinction was weight, with 8 pounds (3.6\u00a0kg) a loose upper limit for what journalists would consider a \"notebook\" in the press. Aside from size and weight considerations, notebooks were also seen as more sleek and stylish than the bulkier laptops. Compared to notebooks, however, laptops saw quicker improvements in processing speed and memory; featured better upgradabilit",

    "Philosophical concept of the human soul from Middle Age Germany\nFragment of Meister Eckhart's remarks on the Ground of the Soul (Sermon 5b) in a contemporary manuscript; G\u00f6ttingen, University of G\u00f6ttingen, Diplomatischer Apparat 10 E IX Nr. 18\nThe concept of the Ground of the Soul (German: Seelengrund) is a term of late medieval philosophy and spirituality that also appears in early modern spiritual literature. The concept was coined by Meister Eckhart (d. 1327/1328) and refers in a figurative sense to a \"place\" in the human soul where, according to spiritual teachings, God or the divine is present and a union of divinity with the soul can come about.\nFrom antiquity, philosophers and theologians proposed theories that later became prerequisites and components of medieval teachings on the ground of the soul. The relevant medieval terminology can also be traced back to the concepts of these thinkers. Ancient Stoic and Neoplatonic philosophers were convinced that there was a guiding authority in the human soul that was analogous or of the same nature as the divine power that governed the universe. This established the possibility of a connection between mortal and error-prone human beings and the realm of the eternal, divine and absolute truth. Church writers took up philosophical concepts of the relationship between God and the soul and reshaped them in a Christian sense. The church father Augustine assumed that there was a realm in the depths of the human mind, the abditum mentis, in which a hidden a priori knowledge lay.\nIn the 12th century, concepts were developed according to which it was possible to contemplate God in the innermost realm of the soul. However, it was not until the late Middle Ages that a fully formed doctrine of the unity of the soul with the divinity at the ground of the soul emerged. Its originator was Meister Eckhart, who referred to St Augustine but primarily proclaimed his own unconventional doctrine of the divine in the human soul, which was offensive at the time. He postulated the existence of an innermost divine quality in the soul, which he designated as the \"ground.\" The ground of the soul was not a creation of God but rather existed above and beyond all created things. It was a simple and limitless entity, devoid of any limiting determinations, and was identical to the \"Godhead,\" the supra-personal aspect of the divine. All created entities are devoid of access to the divine, whereas the uncreated, supra-temporal ground of the soul provides an experience of God, as the godhood is always present there. Eckhart described this experience as the \"birth of God\" in the ground of the soul. The prerequisite for this was \"seclusion\": the soul had to detach itself with the utmost consistency from everything that distracted it from the divine simplicity and undifferentiatedness in its innermost being.\nEckhart's doctrine of the ground of the soul was condemned by the Church as heretical shortly after his death. However, its content was sometimes accepted in a modified form by late medieval seekers of God. In modern times, it has often been regarded as an expression of mystical irrationalism. However, more recent historians of philosophy emphasise that Eckhart in no way devalued reason; rather, he sought to convince with a philosophical argument and understood the ground of the soul as intellect.\nIn the early modern period, the concept of the ground of the soul or soul centre as a place to experience God survived in spiritual literature. It was adopted by Catholic authors as well as in Protestant pietism. The Enlightenment thinkers gave a different meaning to the expression \"soul ground\". They used it to describe the place of a \"dark\" realisation from which clarity emerges.\nBackground\nAntiquity\nIn antiquity, pagan and Christian authors developed doctrines of the soul that anticipated elements of Meister Eckhart's model. This involved a part of the soul that was regarded as divine or godlike or a divine entity within it.\nEarly approaches\nThe pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus (d. 460 BCE) posited that the boundaries of the soul could not be identified even through exhaustive travel of all paths, as its \"logos\" was very deep. Heraclitus regarded the soul as a representative part of the cosmic fire, the power that, according to his teachings, constituted all things and upon which the processes in the universe depended. He also described the soul as a spark of the substance of the stars.\nIn his work, Plato (d. 348/347 BCE) developed a model of the soul in which he ascribed to it a three-part, hierarchically organised structure. According to his theory, the lowest of the three parts of the soul is controlled by sensual desires and is of a passionate and reckless nature. In contrast, the highest part, the sphere of reason, is characterised by its opposite qualities. The middle part, the \"courageous\", is situated between reason and desire. Its function is to implement the decisions arrived at by ",

    "1108 castle in Racib\u00f3rz, Poland\nRacib\u00f3rz Castle is a stronghold mentioned in Gesta principum Polonorum of Gallus Anonymus in an entry dated to the year 1108. The first brick sections were likely built around the mid-13th century.\nHistory\nLocation plan of the castle in 1609 according to W. Sabisch\nIt is speculated that the first mention of the Racib\u00f3rz stronghold dates back to around 845 in a text known as the Bavarian Geographer. It mentions the Golensizi tribe inhabiting the Upper Oder Basin, which had five strongholds. Based on research, it is presumed that one of these strongholds was Racib\u00f3rz. It is also assumed that it could have been Eburium, the legendary capital of the Quadi. The Latin work Commentarius belli adversum Turcas ad Viennam... by Wespazjan Kochowski, which discusses John III Sobieski's expedition to Vienna, describes the 24th of August, the day when the king arrived at the Racib\u00f3rz Castle, as follows:From Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry through Gliwice and Rudy, marching along the road amidst forests to Racib\u00f3rz, where once was the capital of the Quadi, and later the seat of Polish princes of royal blood, where after passing through, heavy troops were left under the care of Hetman Jab\u0142onowski, and the king, along with a strong army, swiftly entered Austrian territory.Wespazjan Kochowski also mentions Racib\u00f3rz in the poem Dzie\u0142o Boskie albo Pie\u015bni Wiednia wybawionego published in 1684, where in chapter XLVII one can read:Here  briefly pausing, he  moved where the Quadi once had their capital in Racib\u00f3rz, from there through the Moravian mountains leading into the land of the Marcomanni, further to Olomouc (...)F.A. Larisch, a German regionalist, believed that Claudius Ptolemy mentioned Racib\u00f3rz. W\u0142adys\u0142aw K. Zieli\u0144ski also mentions this in his work Szl\u0105sk (pruski) s\u0142owem i o\u0142\u00f3wkiem na podstawie najnowszych \u017ar\u00f3de\u0142 przedstawiony published in 1889:According to Count Larisch, Racib\u00f3rz was already known as Eburium under Ptolemy, as the capital of the Buri of the tribe of the Suevi . This name was probably transformed by the later Slavic inhabitants into Hrad-Ebur or Hrad-Ibur, from which the present name Racib\u00f3rz (Hrad-Rad-Rac-ibor) originated.\nFrom 11th to 12th century\nAround the year 1000, there was supposed to be a border fortress in Racib\u00f3rz. Around 1038, the Racib\u00f3rz fortress, like the entire Silesia, fell under Czech rule. The Racib\u00f3rz Castle is first mentioned in Gesta principum Polonorum of Gallus Anonymus in an entry dated 1108. At that time, there was a border castle here. According to the information contained there, the stronghold belonged to the Moravians, and the knights of Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth entered it without a fight, having previously defeated Moravian knights who set out from the stronghold. Racib\u00f3rz was then a very important stronghold in the defensive system of the Polish-Czech border, so its establishment can be associated with the construction of border fortresses during the conflict between the Piasts and the Premyslids (11th\u201312th century), rather than with the Golensyts tribe. According to Gallus Anonymus:When Boles\u0142aw was guarding the country and striving with all his might for the glory of the homeland, it so happened that the Moravians appeared, wanting to preoccupy the Ko\u017ale stronghold in secret from the Poles. At that time, Boles\u0142aw sent certain noble knights to occupy, if possible, Racib\u00f3rz, but he himself did not give up hunting and rest for this reason. These noble knights went away and fought with the Moravians, in which several noble Poles fell in battle, but their comrades took possession of the field of victory and the stronghold. Thus, the Moravians were defeated in battle, and those in the stronghold, unaware of anything, were captured.From 1108 to the beginning of the 14th century, the castle was under the rule of the Piasts. Until the first half of the 14th century, a castellan resided here, and from the end of the 14th century until 1743, it was also the seat of the Racib\u00f3rz district starosta. From 1172, the castle was also a princely residence. During the reign of Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth, the fortress was one of the important strongholds defending the southern border of the Polish state. Karol Maleczy\u0144ski dates the founding of the stronghold to the second half of the 10th century, which was corroborated by archaeological research conducted in the castle courtyard. This location was not chosen randomly, as it utilized the natural bend of the Oder river, which was cut off by a river branch to create an island, later called the Racib\u00f3rz Island. One could get to it via a levee, which is now the route of Zamkowa Street. In 1146, W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile resided at the Racib\u00f3rz Castle, who was expelled by his brothers. In 1172, Mieszko IV Tanglefoot chose Racib\u00f3rz as the capital of his principality. His brother, Boles\u0142aw I the Tall received Lower Silesia and Opole, while Mieszko received the principality of Racib\u00f3rz after their father, W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile.

Prior to its acquisition by Medique, was an independent company for a 168 year history, making it one of the United States' longest-operating pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nOtis Clapp & Son was founded in 1840 by Otis Clapp as a homeopathic-focused pharmacy. The pharmacy grew into a sizable operation as homeopathics grew in popularity in the New England region. It expanded its operations further in the 1870s after Clapp's son, James Wilkinson Clapp, became a partner and it assumed the name \"Otis Clapp & Son\". By the 1890s, the company had expanded its operations, including  into the manufacture of medical equipment such as x-ray machines. In the 1990s, it began to narrow its operations by focusing on the manufacture pharmaceuticals.\nHistory\nOtis Clapp (photographed circa 1870)\n1861 advertisement for Clapp's bookselling and pharmaceuticals\nIn 1840, publisher and bookseller Otis Clapp opened a pharmacy focused on homeopathics in the Back Bay of Boston, Massachusetts. At the time it opened, the city had only three or four homeopathic physicians. The pharmacy is considered to have been the United States' second-established homeopathic pharmacy, and the first in the New England region. Initially, its inventory was limited, however as homeopathy grew more popular in New England so too did the pharmacy. To grow, it moved the location of its storefront in both 1841 and 1855. It became one of the world's largest homeopathic pharmacies, and was well-known and long-operating. Otis Clapp manufactured and marketed his own homeopathic medicines.\nIn the 1870s, his son joined as a business partner of the operation, which was renamed \"Otis Clapp & Son\" in 1874. The younger Dr. Clapp was a research scientist, businessman, and professor of pharmacy at the Boston University Medical School. He had previously worked in his father's store beginning at fourteen years of age. A few years after the father and the son became partners, the company's storefront again moved., and a second store was opened after that. In the 1880s, the pharmacy established a second location in Providence, Rhode Island.\nThe operation expanded its business to include the sale of laboratory equipment; such equipment for medicine and bacteriology. By the 1890s, the company was manufacturing x-ray machines. In 1912, the company built a new headquarters in Boston. The company long remained under the Clapp family's ownership.\nIn the mid-20th century, the company innovated in the production of medicine dispensing equipment.\nIn the late 1990s, the company began specializing in the manufacture of over-the-counter drugs, marketing especially to sell their products to be sold by employers for use in workplaces.\nIn 2008, the company (by then known as Otis Clapp and Buffington) was acquired by Medique Inc. It was, by that time, one of the oldest operating pharmaceutical manufacturers in the United States. Products continue to be sold by Medique under the \"Otis Clapp\" brand name.\nGallery\nAdvertisement for Otis Clapp's business operations, published in the 1868 Boston Directory\nAntique envelope addressed to Otis Clapp & Son\nVintage avertisement for medicine kits that were sold by the company\nCover envelope from a 1895 Otis Clapp & Son advertising mailer\nX-ray machine manufactured by Otis Clapp & Son, photographed circa 1896\n1911 advertisement for Otis & Clapp Malt Liver Oil Compound\n1917 Otis & Clapp retail catalogue\nIllustration of Shadowthin Elastic Stockings, a hosiery product that was manufactured by the company\n1933 advertisement for Otis Clapp & Son's Malt Compound\n",

It was recorded on July 2, 2016, at System Two Studios in Brooklyn, New York, and was released in 2019 by TUM Records.\nReception\nIn a review for All About Jazz, Jerome Wilson wrote: \"This group has all the power, flash and muscle you would expect. Lake's heavy soul and Haynes' cool fire pair up wonderfully while Fonda is a primal force and Altschul's responsiveness to his bandmates and creativity is masterful. This is one of the musical highlights of the year and hopefully these four men continue to play together for some time.\" AAJ's Dan McClenaghan called the album \"an innovative free-jazz outing,\" and stated that it \"presents a free-end-of-the spectrum sound that breaks new ground while maintaining its grip on a late-fifties/mid-sixties foundation of flexibility.\"\nPeter Gamble of Jazz Journal commented: \"composing duties are shared and there's the usual problem of discerning where the written ends (or indeed starts) and the improvisation begins...

    "Municipal building in Reepham, Norfolk, England\nReepham Town Hall is a municipal building in Back Street, Reepham, Norfolk, a town in England. The building, which was originally commissioned as a school, is currently used for as the offices and meeting place of Reepham Town Council.\nHistory\nIn the mid-19th century, the new Rector of Reepham, Frederick Field, who had been a classical scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge, launched an initiative to commission two schools for the area. The first of these was a school for the village of Reepham itself: the site he selected was on Norwich Road and he financed the school himself. It was designed in the Tudor style, built in red brick with stone dressings and opened as Reepham St Mary's School in 1847.\nThe second school was for the small surrounding settlements of Hackford (to the west) and Whitwell (to the southwest): the site he selected was in Back Street on land which was already part of the grounds of his church. It was designed in the Victorian style, built in red brick with stone dressings and opened as the Hackford and Whitwell Parochial School in 1860. The design involved a rectangular shaped building which faced north onto the churchyard. There was a doorway in the left-hand bay; the other bays were fenestrated by sash windows with architraves. Internally, the principal rooms were the main assembly hall and a large kitchen.\nFollowing the implementation of the Elementary Education Act 1870 and the formation of Aylsham Rural District Council in 1894, the local education authority decided to establish a board school to be known as Reepham Primary School in what became known as School Road. The two schools, which had been commissioned by Field, were already too small and, being redundant, closed in 1903 and 1901 respectively.\nIn the early 20th century, the parish council agreed that the former Hackford and Whitwell Parochial School should be converted for community use and was designated Reepham Town Hall. The building was used for a variety of community events including dances in the 1950s. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, Reepham Parish Council was succeeded by Reepham Town Council and the new council used the town hall as its offices and meeting place.\nThe town hall was used as a civil defence headquarters in the television programme The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor, part of the series, Agatha Christie's Poirot, which was broadcast in February 1991. In 2021, Reepham Nursery School proposed relocating to the building, but this was opposed by several community groups which held activities in the building.\n",
    "Monospecific genus of predatory algae\nRapaza viridis (Latin for 'green grasper') is a species of single-celled flagellate within the Euglenophyceae, a group of algae. It is the only species within the genus Rapaza, family Rapazidae and order Rapazida. It was discovered in a tide pool in British Columbia and described in 2012.\nRapaza viridis is the first known mixotroph (an organism that combines photosynthesis and ingestion of food) and kleptoplastic species within the phylum Euglenozoa. It eats microalgae by engulfing them\u2014a process called phagocytosis\u2014and then uses the chloroplasts from these algae to perform photosynthesis, altering the chloroplasts' structure in the process. In particular, Rapaza viridis can only feed on Tetraselmis cells native to their original environment, and will reject any other prey.\nDue to its unique mode of nutrition and phylogenetic position, Rapaza viridis is considered an evolutionary step between phagotrophs and phototrophs with permanent chloroplasts. Scientists consider that the common ancestor of all Euglenophyceae (a group of algae) was similar to R.\u00a0viridis. It likely stole chloroplasts from its prey\u2014just like R.\u00a0viridis\u2014a behavior supported by the discovery of genes in Euglenophyceae that came from different types of algae through a process called horizontal gene transfer. After the divergence of R.\u00a0viridis, the remaining Euglenophyceae acquired permanent plastids from Pyramimonas.\nEtymology\nThe genus name Rapaza comes from Latin  rapax\u00a0'seizing' and 'grasping', in reference to the feeding behavior of the cells. The specific name viridis, meaning 'green', references the color of the chloroplasts and algal prey cells in the process of being digested. Together, the binomial name means 'green grasper' in Latin.\nTaxonomy\nclass=notpageimage| Type locality of Rapaza viridis\nThe genus Rapaza was circumscribed in 2012 by protistologists Aika Yamaguchi, Naoji Yubuki and Brian S. Leander, on a study published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology. It was created to describe a population of euglenids isolated in 2010 from marine water samples collected at a tide pool in Pachena Beach, British Columbia, Canada. After cultivation, various growth experiments and molecular phylogenetics, the microorganisms were shown to belong to the phototrophic euglenids (Euglenophyceae) and were described as the species Rapaza viridis. The new species had a functioning chloroplast but also exhibited phagotrophy, making it the first and only example of mixotrophic euglenids.\nThe genus was defined as including flexible mixotrophic euglenids with two unequal flagella, a minimum of one chloroplast with three membranes and pyrenoids penetrated by stacks of thylakoids, a robust stigma, a paraflagellar swelling, and a feeding pocket supported by microtubules. The species was further defined by the length and width measurements of the cells and flagella, the presence of paramylon grains in the cytoplasm, 16 pellicle strips, four rows of microtubules supporting the feeding pocket, and Tetraselmis as its preferred prey.\nIn 2016, American protozoologist Thomas Cavalier-Smith assigned this genus to several monotypic higher-level taxa: family Rapazidae, order Rapazida and subclass Rapazia within the class Euglenophyceae, leaving the remaining euglenophyceans (Euglenales and Eutreptiales) under a new subclass Euglenophycidae. He defined these three taxa as containing phagotrophic photosynthetic eukaryote-eating (eukaryovorous) euglenids that swim in the water column instead of gliding on the substrate, and present four rows of microtubules supporting the feeding pocket instead of one as in Euglenophycidae. His classification scheme was neglected by other authors in favour of treating the entirety of Euglenida (Euglenophyceae plus a variety of heterotrophic flagellates) as a class, and deprecating the use of Rapazia as a subclass. As of 2021, only Rapazidae and Rapazida are accepted taxa.\nBiology\nMorphology\nTransverse TEM image of R. viridis showing mitochondrion (M), Golgi body (G) and 16 pellicle strips (arrows). Scale bar: 1 \u03bcm\nRapaza viridis is a unicellular flagellate, a type of protist that is capable of swimming by using two flagella that differ in length and in movement. The cells are slender with a tapered posterior end, measuring approximately 10\u201338\u00a0\u03bcm long and 3\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm wide. Both flagella arise from a pocket located at the anterior end of the cell, one twice as long as the other but with the same thickness. The longer flagellum, about 1.25 times the length of the cell, is always directed forward. The shorter flagellum, about 0.65 times the cell length, is directed backward, but sometimes moves forward in an oar-like motion. Like other euglenids, cells are surrounded by a pellicle composed of 16 protein strips arranged helically below the cell membrane, and contain mitochondria with discoidal cristae. As in other spirocutes (i.e. flexible euglenids), cells of R. viridis are capable of 'metaboly' or '",
    "American serial killer (1950\u20132020)\nNathaniel Harvey (March 21, 1950 \u2013 November 27, 2020) was an American murderer and suspected serial killer who was sentenced to death in New Jersey for the 1985 rape-murder of a woman in Plainsboro. He was one of only eight men on New Jersey's death row when it was abolished in 2007 by then-Governor Jon Corzine. He was re-sentenced to life in prison and died at South Woods State Prison in 2020. A few years after his death, he was linked through DNA evidence to a separate rape-murder committed in East Windsor in 1984, and investigators have since speculated he could have committed other killings.\nCrimes\n1978 Middlesex County rape\nOn October 16, 1978, Harvey was driving through Monroe Township in Middlesex County when he began tailing a car being driven by a 24-year-old woman. He followed her home and pulled into her driveway, and approached the woman asking about her family's business. When she went inside to get information, Harvey forced his way in and attacked her. He raped and beat her before the victim managed to escape through a rear window and ran to a neighbor's home for help. Coincidently, the woman had been raped just months prior by 45-year-old Herman Schmidt, who had no known connection to Harvey.\nHarvey turned himself in on October 20 after the victim identified him from a series of photographs. He was charged with rape, assault with intent to rape, atrocious assault, battery, burglary and lewdness. He was convicted of four of these charges in March 1979 and was sentenced to 15\u201320 years in prison. He was imprisoned at New Jersey State Prison until a New Jersey Parole Board granted him parole in early 1983.\nMurder of Donna Macho\nDonna Macho, a 19-year-old Hightstown High School graduate, disappeared from her parents' home in East Windsor on February 26, 1984. Her car was discovered several miles away with blood stains on the passenger seat, leading investigators to believe she had been murdered. Police suspected her kidnapper carried her out of the house and forced her to drive to a secluded location. Detectives also discovered evidence of a sexual assault as semen was found in Macho's bedroom. A reward of $2,000 was put up by her parents for information.\nOn April 2, 1995, a boy scout troop discovered skeletal remains in a wooded area in Cranbury. Along with the remains, pieces of clothing and jewelry were discovered in the immediate area. Through dental records, the remains were identified as belonging to Macho, over eleven years after she went missing.\nMurder of Irene Schnaps\nOn June 17, 1985, the body of 37-year-old Irene Schnaps was discovered inside her Princeton Meadows apartment in Plainsboro Township. The discovery was made by a coworker who went to Schnaps' apartment after she failed to show up to her job at an RCA plant. The initial investigation into her death revealed that she had been sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a blunt object. A bloody sneaker print left by her killer was discovered at the crime scene.\nOn October 28, Harvey was arrested for attempting to kidnap a 13-year-old girl in West Windsor earlier that same month. In a search of his vehicle, police discovered a watch that matched the description of a watch that had been stolen from Schnaps' apartment. Subsequently, a sneaker print that was collected from his vehicle was matched to the one found in Schnaps' apartment. Afterwards, Harvey was charged with her murder and pleaded not guilty.\nConvictions, death sentence and appeals\nHarvey went to trial on September 30, 1986. On the first day, assistant prosecutor Thomas J. Kapsak claimed that, upon his arrest, Harvey confessed to killing Schnaps before later recanting. Harvey's defense denied this and proclaimed their client was innocent. The alleged confession was key as to why the jury found Harvey guilty on all counts on October 10, and seven days later imposed a verdict of death. After his death sentence, Harvey attempted to get a new trial on the basis that his alleged confession should not have been used at trial. In 1991, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Harvey's confession should not have been used as evidence and he was granted a new trial.\nHarvey's second trial spanned from October to December 1994, and he was again convicted and sentenced to death. In 2007, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, a death penalty opponent, signed legislation that officially eliminated capital punishment in the state; because of this, Harvey and the other seven New Jersey death row inmates were resentenced to life in prison. In 2015, Harvey appealed his conviction and again was granted a new trial. In 2017, an appeals court upheld the decision granting Harvey a third trial.\nDeath and aftermath\nOn November 27, 2020, Harvey died at South Woods State Prison while awaiting his third trial.\nIn April 2023, investigators announced they had linked Harvey to Macho's murder based on his DNA matching the semen found in her bed.\nSee also\nList of ser",

    "Mauritanian footballer\nEly Cheikh Voulany (born 31 December 1988) is a Mauritanian footballer who plays as a forward for Libyan club Shabaab al Jabal and the Mauritania national team.\nClub career\nVoulany started playing with Garde Nationale, then moved to ACS Ksar and played for them for two seasons, then moved to Nasr de Sebkha.\nIn the 2010 season, Voulany moved to play with Tevragh-Zeina, and in his first season he was able to win the Mauritanian President's Cup with them and scored one of the winning goals in the final, which was the club's first title in this tournament. In his second season with the team in 2011, Voulany returned to give Tevragh-Zeina its second title in the same tournament, and scored one of the winning goals in the final also against his former team, ACS Ksar. In his third season with the team in 2012, Voulany returned to help his Tevragh-Zeina team win its first title as Mauritanian Premier League. After the 2014 season, Voulany became the top scorer in the Mauritanian league for three consecutive seasons, and Egyptian and Moroccan clubs began trying to sign him. After a crisis between the team's coach and most of its stars, the club loaned Voulany to the Omani club Al-Nahda in January 2015 for a period of five months with an option to purchase.\nVoulany played with Al-Nahda and contributed his goals to the team in the Oman Professional League and the AFC Cup. He was able to score 5 goals in the first 6 matches. After the end of the season, Al-Nahda decided to abandon Voulany and not renew his loan or obtain his contract permanently. After returning to his team, Tevragh-Zeina, he was able to win the Mauritanian Premier League title with them for the 2016 season.\nVoulany signed an one-year deal with Nouadhibou on 17 August 2017. In his first match with the team in the league, he was able to score two goals to lead his team to a 2\u20130 victory against ASAC Concorde and obtain the first 3 points.

    "Francesco (or Francis) Caracciolo (died 31 May 1316) was a Neapolitan nobleman, diplomat and theologian who was the chancellor of Notre-Dame and of the University of Paris from 1309 or 1310 until his death.\nLife\nCaracciolo was born in the latter half of the 13th century, probably in Naples. His father, Ligorio, count of Pisciotta, belonged to a cadet branch of the Caracciolo family. After completing his studies at the University of Naples, he became a counsellor of King Charles II of Naples (r.\u20091285\u20131309). He was sent by Queen Mary as her ambassador to the Roman curia, but he soon abandoned a secular career for theology. Caracciolo obtained a Master of Arts degree before 1300, either at Naples or at the University of Paris. By 1307, he was studying theology at Paris and held a prebend at Rouen.\nThrough the intervention of Duke Robert of Calabria, the future King Robert the Wise, Caracciolo obtained half of a priestly prebend attached to Notre-Dame. In August 1308, Pope Clement V granted him a future full non-priestly prebend in Paris in lieu of his half-prebend. He acquired a further prebend at Beauvais. All of these prebends were a result of his rank and connections. They facilitated his theological studies and gave him a secure income for the rest of his life.\nIn 1309, he wrote to King Robert asking that his old teacher, Peter of Narnia, be permitted to come to Paris to teach. He lectured on the Sentences in the period 1309\u20131311, but was still only a Bachelor of Theology when he was named chancellor. This took place in 1309 or 1310, for he was certainly chancellor for the academic year 1310\u20131311. He finally incepted as a Doctor of Theology in 1311 or 1312.\nCaracciolo was the first foreign chancellor of the university and of Notre-Dame. He served as chancellor while continuing to teach. On 9 September 1311, in his first recorded act as chancellor, he approved the works of Ramon Lull, which had come under criticism. After the death of Cardinal Landolfo Brancaccio on 29 October 1312, King Robert conferred one of his abbeys on Caracciolo. He was seemingly ill by 1 March 1316, since he did not preside at the inception of Prosper of Reggio Emilia. He remained in Paris as chancellor until his death on 31 May 1316. On his deathbed he joined the Dominican Order.\nWorks\nAlthough Caracciolo was a very prominent theologian during his time at Paris, very few of his writings have survived. He was a defender of the Immaculate Conception and is usually cited by other as \"the Chancellor\" (Cancellarius).\nThere are several witnesses to Caracciolo's lectures on Book III of the Sentences. John of Saint-Germain's notes on the lectures are found in the manuscript Worcester, Cathedral Library, F 69 under the title Notabilia Cancellarii addita super tertium. In his commentary on the Sentences, Peter of Palude cites Caracciolo even more extensively while discussing Book III and once on Book I. An anonymous disciple of Palude's included similar quotations in his commentary, which is largely derivative of Palude's. It is found in the manuscript Barcelona, Arxiu de la Corona d'Arag\u00f3, Ripoll 77bis.\nReports also survive of Caracciolo's role as an opponent in the inception disputation of Thomas Wylton in late spring 1312. There is a report attached to the Notabilia Cancellarii in the Worcester manuscript and another in the notebook of Prosper of Reggio Emilia, now Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, lat. 1086. Prosper also records four questions from a disputation of Caracciolo's, probably that associated with his own inception.\nThe Vatican manuscript Borghese 171 contains one quodlibetal question by Caracciolo and a Quaestio de ydeis that may have been written by him but more probably by Thomas Wylton. Up to six quodlibetal disputations of which record survives, but the attribution of those in the Vatican manuscript Latin 932 to him is disputed.\nThere is a quire bound as part of the manuscript Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, Latin 15669 that was probably written by Caracciolo himself. The handwriting is small. It contains one partial and one complete draft of the letter to King Robert and a series of short texts probably composed by Caracciolo.\nNotes\n^ a b c d e f Glorieux 1976.\n^ a b Courtenay 2013, p.\u00a061.\n^ Duba 2020, p.\u00a0141.\n^ Courtenay 2013, pp.\u00a051, 61.\n^ Courtenay 2013, pp.\u00a066\u201369.\n^ Courtenay 2013, pp.\u00a050, 54.\n^ Courtenay 2013, p.\u00a083.\n^ Courtenay 2013, p.\u00a051.\n^ Courtenay 2013, pp.\u00a053, 73.\n^ Courtenay 2013, p.\u00a052.\n^ Courtenay 2013, p.\u00a079.\n^ Edited in Long 1968.\n^ Courtenay 2013, pp.\u00a079\u201380.\n^ Courtenay 2013, pp.\u00a081\u201383.\n^ Courtenay 2013, pp.\u00a080\u201381.\nBibliography\nCourtenay, William J.

    "American sex offender (1928-2018)\nClaudius Ira \"Bud\" Vermilye Jr. (1928 \u2013 June 22, 2018) was an American defrocked Episcopal priest and child pornographer who operated the \"Boys' Farm\" in rural Franklin County, Tennessee, between 1971 and 1976.\nEarly life\nClaudius Vermilye was born in 1928 and raised in Bayside, Queens, New York City. He graduated from Bayside High School and attended the local All Saints Episcopal Church. During the Korean War, Vermilye served in the Air Force for four years as a staff sergeant at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. After the war, he moved to Tennessee and graduated from Tusculum University. Vermilye was ordained a priest in 1948 and served the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee.\nIn 1971, he opened the 1\u00bd-acre Boys' Farm of Roarks Cove in Alto, Tennessee, marketed as a rehabilitation center for homeless and wayward youths\u2014a place where \"boys could learn self-respect and responsibility.\" Troubled adolescents were placed into his custody by courts, welfare agencies, and, in some cases, their parents. The Boys' Farm was not church-sponsored and was funded largely by its clientele.\nBoys' Farm\nDuring his tenure as director of the Boys' Farm, Vermilye sexually abused his wards, aged 11 to 16, and photographed them engaging in sexual acts amongst each other. The photographs were developed in a darkroom located in his attic and were mailed to customers in and out of state, often with assistance from the boys. The children were also engaged in prostitution during overnight stays with customers.\nLaw enforcement became aware of illegal activities at the farm after his advertisements appeared in pornographic magazines, and from material found while investigating a New Orleans scoutmaster. During the execution of a search warrant at the farm, police discovered developed and undeveloped images of child pornography, as well as card catalogs containing the names of hundreds of current and previous financial contributors. Several of the sponsors would go on to testify against Vermilye at his trial in exchange for legal immunity in Tennessee.\nAccording to several boys who went on to testify, their homosexual activities were consensual, and none mentioned any use of force on Vermilye's part. One, however, said it was understood that the photography sessions were required if they wanted to continue living at the farm. Vermilye denied knowledge or responsibility for most of the photographs and said that he had shot a few of them for an artist and for \"sublimation counseling\" with his homosexual clients, whom he was trying to help stay closeted. He claimed the remaining photographs were placed on the farm by agents of an unspecified \"national child porn ring.\"\nIn addition to the crimes committed against his wards, Vermilye also used his son William for child pornography. William disappeared in the summer of 1974 and was never found.\nLegal proceedings\nFollowing Vermilye's November 1976 arrest, ex-ward David Forrister sued the state of Tennessee for $1 million, claiming that corrections officials placed him in a male prostitution ring and willfully neglected their duty to investigate the facility. Forrister's lawyer claimed that he and other boys who refused to cooperate were beaten and subjected to \"constant pressure to conform.\"\nOn June 3, 1977, a jury of ten found Vermilye guilty. He was sentenced to five to ten years of imprisonment for crimes against nature and ten to fifteen years for aiding and abetting crimes against nature, totaling an effective sentence of 25 to 40 years in prison. In 1978, he was deposed from the priesthood while free on bond, pending a later failed appeal to the Supreme Court.\nIn 1984, Vermilye again sought retrial, claiming that his conviction and sentences were void due to a denial of his constitutional right to effective legal counsel. His request was denied by the Supreme Court in December 1987.\nLater life\nVermilye died on June 22, 2018, in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, aged 89.\nSee also\nJohn David Norman\n",

    "The contiguously urbanized border area between southern Al Daayen and northern Doha is considered a part of the Doha Metropolitan Area\nThe Doha Metropolitan Area (DMA; also known as Greater Doha Area) is the metropolitan area of Doha, the capital city of Qatar. The DMA comprises several contiguous cities and urban zones immediately surrounding Doha, serving as the main area of Qatar's population concentration. As of 2021, the population of the metropolitan area is upwards of 2 million.\nBoundaries\nThe exact boundaries of the DMA are open to interpretation, with different definitions existing. However, at a minimum, the following areas are included in the DMA: \nAll of Ad-Dawhah Municipality\nParts of Al Rayyan Municipality\nAspire Zone\nEducation City\nDoha Industrial Area\nWholesale Market Area\nAl Rayyan City\nParts of Al Daayen Municipality\nSome definitions attribute a larger area to the DMA by including the entire urbanized section in the easternmost half of Al Rayyan Municipality, all of northern Al Wakrah Municipality terminating before Mesaieed, all of Umm Salal Municipality and all of Al Daayen Municipality, including the city of Lusail.\nHistory\nThe Doha Metropolitan Area has witnessed substantial growth since the 1980s, marking when Qatar began investing its hydrocarbon wealth into developing its infrastructure on a major scale. From 1984 to 2020, the metropolitan area expanded eightfold while the amount of bare land decreased by half.\nIn 2003, Greater Doha's urban confines primarily clustered around the downtown core. However, a gradual westward expansion, encompassing segments of Al Rayyan Municipality, mirrored the city's demographic influx. This foundational growth phase laid the groundwork for subsequent transformations of Greater Doha.\nA notable a milestone in Greater Doha's urbanization was the 2006 Asian Games, which catalyzed a rapid surge in urban development, directing attention towards the western districts and culminating in the development of the Aspire Zone. This urban sprawl coincided with the emergence of new residential developments.\nBy 2007, Greater Doha's geographical boundaries had expanded further, enveloping extensive swathes of Al Daayen Municipality. This sustained pattern of urbanization continued in the following years, characterized by progressions westward and northward. Since then, the traditional population centers of Greater Doha have shifted from densely populated downtown hubs to areas flanking the ring roads, encroaching into the neighboring municipalities of Al Rayyan and Al Daayen.\n",

    "Choir at St John's College, Cambridge, England\nSt John's College Chapel\nSt John's Voices is the secondary choir of St John's College, Cambridge, alongside the College choir of St John's. Founded in 2013 to allow female members of the college to take part in the college's choral tradition, it is a mixed voice adult choir, comprising around 30 singers. As well as singing Choral Evensong in the College chapel, St John's voices gives frequent concerts, and has toured internationally. The choir's outreach has extended to Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The choir has also produced critically acclaimed recordings under the Naxos label, of works by William Mathias and Pavel Chesnokov.\nReactions to disbandment\nIn March 2024, the choir received written notice from the college that St John's Voices would be disbanded by June 2024. They stated that the decision was made to \"to adopt a broader approach to the provision of co-curricular opportunities in music for our students, including in different genres\". This decision caused widespread controversy, due to the reduction of opportunities for female singers. Despite the fact that St John's College choir has admitted women since 2022, it does not include soprano voices.\nMembers of St John's Voices initiated a campaign against the disbandment, condemning the decision as \"regressive\" in an open letter which received over 14,000 signatures. They stated that the admission of female singers into the Choir of St John's College had been \"weaponised against the very existence of another ensemble, supposedly in the name of broadening opportunities\". The open letter received national media attention from The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph and The Independent, with notable supporters including Rowan Williams, Simon Rattle, Sarah Connolly, Gareth Malone, Alexander Armstrong, Anna Lapwood, and John Rutter.\nIn response to the protest, the college released a statement saying that the move was made to \"redirect the significant resources currently devoted to St John's Voices\", highlighting that the choir has recently expanded to include members from other colleges.\n",
    "American football coach (born c. 1937)\nDaniel J. Stanley (born c.\u20091937) is an American former college football coach. He was the head football coach for Westport High School from 1965 to 1970 and from 2008 to 2011, Winnetonka High School from 1971 to 1994, Missouri Valley College from 1996 to 2001, and the University Academy from 2012 to 2013.\nPlaying career\nStanley was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and attended Southeast High School. He played college football for Missouri Valley as a fullback in the team's single wing offense. He was known by his teammates as \"Tanker\" or \"Dan the Man.\" During his junior year in 1957, despite missing time due to injuries, he ran for 242 yards on 57 attempts. In his senior year, he led the team in scoring with 84 points and led the team in rushing yards with 661 yards on the year. He was also used as an occasional quarterback and kick returner. He specialized in the javelin throw in track and field.\nFrom 1961, Stanley played for the semi-professional Kansas City Jiggers which were known as the Rivals in 1962.\nCoaching career\nIn 1959, Stanley began his coaching career at William Chrisman High School. In 1962, he was hired as an assistant for Central High School.\nIn 1965, Stanley became the head football coach for Westport High School.

    "Species of lichen\nPeltigera castanea is a species of terricolous and muscicolous (ground- and moss-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Peltigeraceae. Described as a new species in 2003, it is part of the taxonomically challenging species complex centred around Peltigera didactyla. Recognised based on phylogenetic studies that highlighted its unique genetic markers, P.\u00a0castanea is distinguished by its dark, chestnut-coloured upper surface, which inspired its vernacular name, chestnut pelt lichen. Its known distribution includes North America (British Columbia, Western Canada), Asia (China and Siberia), Europe (Estonia), Greenland, and the Antarctic. The conservation status of Peltigera castanea varies regionally, from being critically imperiled in British Columbia and Yukon to critically endangered in Estonia due to significant habitat degradation and restricted population size.\nPeltigera castanea is distinguished by its foliose, leaf-like thallus that loosely attaches to the substrate, covering up to 8\u00a0cm (3+1\u20448\u00a0in) with stiff, overlapping lobes that often curl upwards. Its distinctive upper surface is chestnut-brown, turning pale bluish-grey when sheltered, and features granular soredia for vegetative reproduction, housed within irregularly shaped soralia. The lichen's densely veined lower surface transitions from white to black, with tufted rhizines that become woolly towards the centre. Compared to related species in the genus Peltigera, such as P.\u00a0extenuata and P.\u00a0didactyla, P.\u00a0castanea has a smooth, shiny, mostly non-tomentose upper cortex, darkening veins, and flocculent, often tufted rhizines, whereas its relatives show variations in lobe concavity and surface texture, including the presence of apothecia (fruiting bodies).\nTaxonomy\nPeltigera castanea was scientifically described as a new species in 2003 by the lichenologists Trevor Goward, Bernard Goffinet, and Jolanta Mi\u0105dlikowska. The lichen falls within the Peltigera didactyla species complex, a group known for its taxonomic challenges due to subtle morphological differences among its members. The species was officially recognised following phylogenetic studies, which identified it as a distinct monophyletic group\u2014a unique evolutionary lineage\u2014separate from other members of the Peltigera didactyla complex. These studies were based on DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region and the large subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene, demonstrating that P.\u00a0castanea forms a distinct lineage and highlighting genetic variations unique to this species.\nGoward collected the type specimen of Peltigera castanea in British Columbia's Clearwater River Basin, near Philip Creek along the Battle Mountain Road at an elevation of about 1,500\u00a0m (4,900\u00a0ft) on 1 October 2001. The specimen grew on a moss-covered boulder in an open, sunlit forest on a south-facing hillside. The species epithet castanea, meaning \"chestnut\", refers to the lichen's dark, chestnut-coloured upper surface, a trait that also inspired its vernacular name, \"chestnut pelt lichen\".\nPhylogenetically, Peltigera castanea is closely related to other species within the Peltigera didactyla complex, such as P.\u00a0lambinonii and P.\u00a0ulcerata. While sharing some morphological traits, P.\u00a0castanea has unique genetic markers that confirm its distinct species status. The complex itself is part of a larger grouping of lichens that have been difficult to categorize due to their overlapping morphological traits and the subtleties in chemical and genetic distinctions.\nDescription\nPeltigera castanea can be differentiated from other species within its genus by several distinctive features of its thallus, a term which refers to the body of the lichen. The thallus of Peltigera castanea is foliose, meaning it is leaf-like and loosely attached to its substrate, covering areas up to 6\u20138\u00a0cm (2+3\u20448\u20133+1\u20448\u00a0in) across. The individual lobes comprising the thallus are stiff, fragile, and not much longer than they are wide, with a strong concavity or sometimes flat appearance, featuring loosely overlapping and irregularly branched patterns. The tips of the lobes are rounded and tend to curl upwards.\nCloseup of tomentose lobe tip, irregularly shaped soralia, and granular soredia\nThe upper surface of the thallus is notable for its dark chestnut-brown colour, which becomes a pale bluish grey when sheltered. The surface is more or less shiny and smooth except for being tomentose (covered with short, soft hairs) near the lobe tips. This surface is also characterised by the presence of soredia\u2014granular reproductive structures that help in vegetative reproduction\u2014found in rounded to irregularly shaped soralia (structures that house the soredia).\nThe lower surface of the lichen is densely veined, gradually shifting from white at the edges to brown or black near the centre. The rhizines (root-like structures underneath the lichen) are abundant, tufted, and become flocculent (woolly) towards the centre of the thallus, matching the ",

MEMRI had reported in 2022 about a YouTube video by Tareq Al-Suwaidan in which he described his daughter's anti-Israel activism at Harvard, urging young Arabs at Western universities to collaborate for the Palestinian cause.\n",
    "Estonian painter (1905\u20131990)\nRaoul Kernumees (until 1936 Raoul Kirnmann; October 25, 1905 \u2013 June 25, 1990) was an Estonian printmaker and painter.\nEarly life and education\nKernumees was born in Udeva, the son of Juhan Kernumees (n\u00e9 Kirnmann, 1862\u2013?) and Anna Maria Kirnmann (n\u00e9e Kontrakt, 1877\u20131918). He was the youngest child in a family of five children. He started his schooling at the Rakvere Educational Society School, and his next-door neighbor was the future artist Hando Mugasto.\nIn 1917, the family moved to Tallinn. In 1918, he started studying at Tallinn City High School on Vene t\u00e4nav\u00a0 (Russian Street). His drawing teacher there noticed Kernumees's artistic talent and advised him to continue his studies at the State Industrial Art School. Kernumees studied there from 1921 to 1923. In 1925, Kernumees, together with Erich Leps, Kaarel Liimand, and Andrus Johani, went to study at the Pallas Art School in Tartu. His studies at Pallas were interrupted (1925\u20131927, 1930\u20131931, 1933) due to both financial reasons and the tuberculosis that shattered his health in 1927. Kernumees's name first appears in the catalog of exhibition works by Pallas students in 1925.\nCareer\nKernumees started presenting his work at art exhibitions in 1931, mainly with prints. In 1932, the Estonian Government Foundation for the Fine Arts\u00a0 acquired four of Kernumees's works: K\u00fclak\u00f5rts (Village Inn), P\u00f5rgu (Hell), Peaparandus (Hair of the Dog), and Tulekahi (Conflagration), and he was awarded a scholarship for six months (his fellow scholarship recipient was Eduard Timberman\u00a0). From then on, Kernumees consistently exhibited almost every year, except for the more severe years of his illness from 1936 to 1938. In 1942, the publisher Eesti Kirjastus ordered illustrations from Kernumees for the Nibelungenlied translated by Marta Sillaots. Kernumees created 12 ink drawings, but they were lost in the chaos of the war, and the book was never published. However, these illustrations were exhibited once in 1944. Kernumees also continued to participate in exhibitions in Estonia under Soviet rule.\nWorks\nKernumees attracted attention as an especially virtuosic and detailed draftsman, and a master of figural compositions. He mainly portrayed villagers, whose monotonous everyday life was enhanced by a bottle of vodka and a song accompanied by an accordion. Nationalism also characterizes Kernumees's fantastic grotesque drawings; for example, P\u00f5rgu (Hell; 1931, ink, Art Museum of Estonia), created at the same time as Eduard Wiiralt's etching of the same name\u00a0. In addition to painting landscapes and still lifes in oil, Kernumees was also a portraitist, mainly in pastel. He painted many portraits of cultural figures.\nFamily\nKernumees married Liidia Kivikas (1913\u20131985); their daughter was the artist Maret Kernumees (1934\u20131997) and their son was the musician Koit Kernumees (1947\u20132011). The artist Valdur Ohakas was Kernumees's nephew.\n",
    "British puppeteer\nOlive Blackham (1899\u20132002) was a British puppeteer. She was the director of the experimental Roel Puppets theatre company, author of Shadow Puppets (1961) and \u201cone of the leading authorities on all forms of puppetry\u201d. In 1948 she was one of the first puppeteers to appear on television, in a broadcast from Alexandra Palace.\nPersonal life\nBlackham was born in West Bromwich to Harriet and Walter Blackham. She was the oldest of four siblings. A brother was the philosopher Harold John Blackham. Blackham attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, after which she worked for a bank in Birmingham. In 1932 she moved to Roel Farm, Cheltenham where she established the Roel Puppets theatre company. During WWII she worked at Lloyd's Bank in Montpellier.\nIn the mid-1960s she retired to Cheltenham. After donating her puppets to several museums, she turned her attention to weaving. She died at the Sherborne Tower Care Centre, aged 103. In lieu of flowers, donations were made to the Puppet Centre Trust.\nPuppetry career\nWhile working as a bank clerk in the early 1930s, Blackham read a book on puppetry and was inspired to put on a \u201clittle show on the dining-room table\u201d for her family. The following year her brother built her a stage, which focused her interest. Eventually \u201cso many friends came to see her puppet, that  took a loft over a stable in Kings Heath\u201d in 1927, which became a small experimental theatre, The Ark. The name was inspired by the stable's appearance, its entrance being up a ladder and through a trap door.\nThe Ark\nBlackham ran The Ark with a group of friends, including Bernard Griffin, Gerald Shaw and Frances Norris. Blackham wrote the plays, designed the sets and made the costumes. Of The Ark she said, \"It is not run merely to entertain. It is a puppet theatre workshop where we can experiment in every form of theatre activity in miniature. It is the outcome of a revolt against the cramping conditions the modern playwrights have imposed upon theatre and against the spiritual weariness their fare induces. We are experimenting with puppets in the belief that they can lead the way to a more beautiful and satisfying theatre.\"\nThe Ark ran from 1927 to 1932, at which point she decided to give up her job and make puppets her career.\nRoel Puppets Theatre\nWith money she had saved from her work, she moved to the Cotswolds in 1932 and bought a granary belonging to Roel Farm in Guiting Power where she established the Roel Puppets theatre company. Active until 1961, it put on performances each spring and summer, and toured during autumn and winter, playing at theatres, colleges and private houses.\nBetween 1936 and 1958 Blackham would run an annual summer school where participants would create their own puppets and visit the nearby Lanchester Marionettes Theatre in Malvern. The Roel Puppets\u2019 patron was Sir Barry Jackson. Her long-time assistant was Amina Chatwin. Other puppeteers who worked in the company included: Mary Morley, Joyce Blackham, Gray Skipworth and Robert Tronson.\nIn 1937 Roel Puppets were chosen by the British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild to represent British puppet theatre at the 1937 Paris Exhibition. In 1939 the theatre historian George Speaight worked with her to learn the art of puppetry.\nExperimental ideas\nBlackham \u201ctested the possibilities of the marionette as an art form\u201d. Her experimental ideas included:\nFor Alfred Kreymborg\u2019s 1925 play Lima Beans, Blackham made faceless puppets; the woman\u2019s head was a sphere, the man\u2019s was a cube, and \u201cthe audience\u2019s imagination was stirred to invent features and changes of expression.\u201d\nRather than making the mannequin's strings as invisible as possible, she experimented with making them thick and \u201cbrightly coloured against a neutral background.\u201d\nRather than using the traditional wooden \u2018control\u2019 or \u2018perch\u2019 for the strings of marionettes, she attached them to the fingertips of a pair of gloves.\nWorld War II\nDuring WWII Blackham toured extensively with a simpler theatre using glove puppets, as it was \u201cimpossible to obtain the transport for the complicated mechanism necessary for a string show\u201d. In 1939 some of Blackham's students took puppet-making and manipulation techniques into evacuation camps. In November of the same year the Cannon Hall Museum, Birmingham, which was closed at the outbreak of the war, with all its permanent collection moved to safety, reopened with an \u201cexhibition of theatrical designs and puppets\u201d, including puppets made by Blackham.\nPost-World War II\nIn 1948 the Roel Puppets appeared on a television programme broadcast from Alexandra Palace. Puppet Pie was a 30-minute show featuring Blackham's glove and rod puppets. In the same year she appeared at the Cheltenham Music Festival. In 1950 the Roel Puppets appeared on the BBC show Children\u2019s Newsreel. In 1960 Blackham worked with costume designer and Thunderbirds wardrobe supervisor, Elizabeth Coleman.

His life was much more discreet than those of his brothers, some of whom were also football players, such as Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda (1889), Santiago (1890) and Ram\u00f3n (1891), who all played for Athletic Bilbao, while the others were writers, brilliant lawyers or illustrious scholars of the Basque language.\nProfessional carrer\nBelauste studied Medicine for almost twenty years at the Faculty of Barcelona and he took advantage of his stay in the Catalan capital to join the ranks of RCD Espanyol, playing as a defender for the club's second team. He specialized there in the throat, nose, and ears, and returned to Bilbao, where he worked as such at Gota de Leche, the Montep\u00edo de la Mujer que Trabajo and in his office on Calle de la Estaci\u00f3n No. 8. He selflessly served in the Ledo office and for this reason, he was granted entry into the Civil Order of Charity.\nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, Belauste remained in Bilbao. There was no news that he suffered persecution by the Franco authorities, unlike his brothers, several of whom went into exile in Mexico. He continued to work after the war and enjoyed a good name among the population and among his medical colleagues. Cultured man, member of Eusko Ikaskuntza, he dedicated his free time to the study of eating habits and Basque Popular Medicine. He wrote about both topics in the magazine Vida Vasca.\nPlaying carrer\nBilbao FC\nIn the late 1890s, Belauste became a member of an informal group led by Carlos and Manuel Castellanos, the so-called Bilbao Football Club, the first entity to play football in Bilbao since the disappearance of Club Atleta. Although it was formed in 1896, it was not until 30 November 1900 that the Bilbao Football Club was officially established in a meeting held in the house of industrialist Jos\u00e9 Luis de Villabaso (1852\u20131917) in the Biscayan neighborhood of Algorta. However, before he even could play one match for the club, he moved to Barcelona to complete his studies, and there he joined the ranks of Espanyol.\nRCD Espanyol\nTogether with \u00c1ngel Ponz, Gustavo Green, Emilio Sampere, and the three Joaquins (Escard\u00f3, Carril, and Garc\u00eda), Belauste was part of the team that won the first edition of the Campionat de Catalunya in 1903\u201304.\nPersonal life\nBelauste married the Cuban Ysabel de Azcue Gorostizaga, and the couple had three children Manuel, Ram\u00f3n, and Javier Belausteguigoitia Azcue.\nBelauste died in Bilbao in 1946, at the age of either 66 or 67.\nHonours\nRCD Espanyol\nCatalan championship:\nChampions (1): 1903\u201304\n",
    "\nEleanor Mary \"Ella\" Latham CBE (n\u00e9e\u00a0Tobin; 10 October 1878 \u2013 26 March 1964) was an Australian charity worker and hospital administrator. She served as president of the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne from 1933 to 1954.\nEarly life\nLatham was born on 10 October 1878 in Northcote, Victoria. She was the only child of schoolteachers Fanny Louisa (n\u00e9e Matthews) and Richard Tobin, who lived along Merri Creek. Her father authored the petition for the creation of the Borough of Northcote in 1883.\nLatham attended the University High School, Melbourne, and went on to graduate Bachelor of Arts from the University of Melbourne in 1904. The following year she and her friend Jessie Webb published a poetry anthology titled Phases of Literature from Pope to Browning: Prose and Verse Selections. After graduation she worked as a schoolteacher until her marriage in 1907, when she was required to resign in accordance with the marriage bar in place at the time.\nPublic life\nLatham had a long-standing involvement with Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital (RCH). She joined a suburban auxiliary (volunteer group) in 1923 and in 1926 was appointed to the hospital's management committee. She served as president of the committee from 1933 to 1954, resigning after grooming Elisabeth Murdoch as her successor. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the same year.\nAlong with medical director Vernon Collins and lady superintendent Lucy de Neeve, Latham oversaw the transformation of RCH from \"a charity hospital to an institution that provided medical services of the highest quality, education and training facilities for staff, a research organization in both curative and preventive medicine, and a link with the university\". In 1946 she launched an appeal for a complete rebuild of the hospital closer to existing medical research institutions, which eventuated in 1963 with the hospital's move to Parkville. One of her innovations was the introduction of an independent medical advisory board to advise the committee on appointments of senior medical staff.\nLatham had a particular interest in paediatric orthopaedics and in 1935 co-founded the Victorian Society for Crippled Children (now part of Yooralla). She helped establish a rehabilitation centre for disabled children at Frankston, including a \"craft hostel\" providing training in carpentry and home economics. After World War II she conducted a study tour of orthopaedic hospitals in the United Kingdom.\nLatham was a founding member of Melbourne's Lyceum Club in 1912 and later served as president from 1925 to 1926. She also served on the national committee of the Australian Red Cross, serving as the delegate for the territorial divisions of New Guinea, Norfolk Island, the Northern Territory, and Papua.\nPersonal life\nLatham and her husband in Melbourne in 1940\nLatham married John Greig Latham in 1907, with whom she had three children. The couple were predeceased by their daughter Freda, who died from complications of diabetes, and older son Richard, who was killed in World War II.\nLatham died on 26 March 1964, aged 85. Her husband died a few months later.\n",

    "Spanish footballer and manager\nAndr\u00e9s Aranda Guti\u00e9rrez (7 August 1905 \u2013 10 March 1965) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Real Betis, and later a manager, taking charge over Betis and Recreativo de Huelva.\nHe began his career as a player at Real Betis in 1921, aged 16, remaining there for 13 uninterrupted seasons until the 1933\u201334 season, being one of the team's most outstanding players during those years, in which they won the Andalusian championship in 1928 and reached the final of the 1931 Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao. He was a very versatile player, who covered almost all positions on the field, starting his career as a defender, later moving on to play inside on both sides, even playing as a goalkeeper, always characterized by great dedication.\nPlaying career\nAndr\u00e9s Aranda was born in the Sevillian town of Lora del R\u00edo on 7 August 1905, moving to Seville in 1917, at the age of 12. The Aranda family settled in the Puerta Real neighborhood, and there, the young Andr\u00e9s was part of one of the many popular teams that made up the local categories, such as Estrella FC and Agrupaci\u00f3n Deportiva Museo. In this team, he and teammate Manuel Nogueras quickly stood out from the rest and they eventually drew the attention of Betis, with Aranda joining their ranks in 1921, when he was 16 years old, and both went on to become very important footballers during the 1920s.\nAranda made his official debut with Betis on 13 November 1921, on the first day of the Andalusian Championship, helping his side to a 3\u20131 victory over Sevilla FC. In doing so at the age of 16 years and 104 days, he remains the youngest footballer in the history of the club to officially wear the Betis jersey of the first team, since Juan Baena, who debuted with a little over 15 years old, did it in a friendly match. Aranda was a very versatile player, who covered almost all positions on the field, including goalkeeper: in a friendly match against Recreativo de Huelva on 23 December 1923, where he replaced the injured Jes\u00fas, and then he did it again against Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, he replaced the injured Jes\u00fas again in a League match. He was a true wild card, standing out for his dedication and fight although he was also a player with technique.\nAranda played with Betis for over a decade, initially as a defender, but then developed into a lethal striker, becoming one of the main architects of the team's football power in Andalusia, competing head-to-head against Sevilla, finishing as the runner-ups of the Andalusian championship for five consecutive years (1922\u201323, 1923\u201324, 1924\u201325, 1925\u201326, 1926\u201327) before finally winning it 1928. Sevilla, who had greater economic and social power, was constantly plundering his rival's best players, but Aranda always refused their offers and remained loyal to Betis, and following the regulation of professionalism in 1926, which brought order to the football market, Aranda saw how Betis grew throughout the second half of the 1920s, winning the Andalusian championship in 1928, premiering the Estadio de Nervi\u00f3n with victory in 1929, reaching the Cup final in 1931, which they lost 1\u20133 to Athletic Bilbao, and achieving promotion to the First Division in 1932.\nAranda also traveled on the tour of Germany in 1925, in which he was baptized as \"the Scientist\". In the following year, he was a member of the first Betis side that played in the Copa del Rey and that won La Copa Spencer in 1926, named after the recently deceased Sevilla player, whose coffin was carried by Aranda, among others, through the streets of Seville.\nAranda had to retire in 1933 due to an annoying ankle injury, playing his last game on the Christmas Day of 1933 in Nervi\u00f3n, in a friendly match against the Sevilla reserves. He retired with a total of almost 300 official and friendly matches with Real Betis. On 8 September 1940, Aranda received a tribute match from Real Betis before a friendly between Betis and Xerez FC.\nManagerial career\nIn 1934, almost immediately after leaving active football, Aranda joined the Betis youth team as a coach and entered the technical ranks of the club, being in charge of preparing the amateur team that won the 1934\u201335 amateur Andalusian championship. Despite being a man of good humor, his iron discipline led him to be the \"father\" of the team, since his companions respected him without question due to being a natural leader. At the beginning of the 1935\u201336 season, in October 1935, at only 30 years old, Aranda took over the management of the first team during the regional championship, as well as in the league, to replace the Irishman Patrick O'Connell after his departure to FC Barcelona and after the Englishman Charlie Slade had failed with embarrassing defeats to Xerez, Racing de C\u00f3rdoba, Mirandilla FC, and CD Malacitano. Despite picking up Betis not only in a bad run of form, but also devalued compared to the previous year after the departure of Pedro Areso and Sim\u00f3n Lecue, Aranda still managed to lead",
    "Magnitude 6.4 earthquake in Colombia\nA moment magnitude 6.4 earthquake affected the Valle del Cauca, Choco, and Risaralda departments of Colombia on February 8, 1995, at 18:40 UTC. Its epicenter was located 42.5 kilometres (26.4\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Buga. The earthquake was felt in much of Colombia and there was major damage.\nEarthquake\nThe earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.4 and a depth of 73.5 kilometres (45.7\u00a0mi). The epicenter was 24 kilometres (15\u00a0mi) northwest of the town of Dari\u00e9n, at 4.104\u00b0N 76.622\u00b0W. Tremors were felt across Colombia, reaching as far out as Bogota. Due to the location of the earthquake and its tectonic setting, it was not as strong in parts such as northern Colombia. Its corresponding focal mechanism pointed to normal faulting. Aftershocks were later reported with various magnitudes ranging between 3.0 and 5.6.\nImpact\nOver 2,000 buildings across the area were damaged and 700 were reported to have collapsed. 4 schools and 22 community centers in the areas affected were damaged, as well as a provincial government building, colleges, police stations, and offices. Telephone poles were destroyed, and utilities such as electricity and water were cut off as water mains burst and wires were split. Two highways were blocked due to landslides that were caused by the earthquake.\nShortly after the earthquake, relief teams were deployed made up of Red Cross personnel, firemen, policemen, and civil defense officers. A state of emergency was later declared by the Colombian Government in response to the earthquake. Many walls and buildings had collapsed, causing multiple deaths in towns such as Palestina, Armenia, and Pereria.\nAftermath\nOver 7,000 people were impacted by the earthquake. 3,000 were left homeless due to the substantial damage caused by the quake. Immediately after the initial earthquake, medical teams were sent out to aid people who were injured, with some cases having to airlift patients due to the damage. Blood was brought to victims who required it from national resources, and first aid tents were set up.\nRelief supplies were sent out, with kits including corrugated iron and plastic sheets, mattresses, blankets, sanitation kits, and emergency food rations. Cash grants of US$20,000 were given out to people as well for personal belonging replacements.\nMany homeless people stayed with their friends or relatives on industrialized areas or coffee farms, while others were brought to temporary shelters set up in schools or tent camps. During reconstruction, there were concerns about housing for the homeless.\nSee also\nList of earthquakes in Colombia\nList of earthquakes in 1995\n1994 Paez River earthquake\n",
    "English fundraiser (1871-1933)\nHelen Drage Little (b. Winchester, 1871 d. York, 8 Nov 1933) led a successful fundraising campaign in 1922 to restore the Five Sisters window of York Minster and have it dedicated to the women of the British Empire who died in the line of service during World War I.\nPersonal life\nHelen Drage Beckwith was born to Rev. George and Emily Jane Beckwith in Winchester, Hampshire in 1871. She had a younger brother Arthur. At least two sisters died in infancy.\nShe married Colonel Charles Blakeway Little of Somerset Light Infantry at Winchester Cathedral on 10 January 1899. She died at St Peter's Grove, York.\nWorld War I\nLittle was in Cairo when the first trainloads of wounded arrived from Gallipoli. She wrote that she \"was witness to the untiring devotion under great difficulties of the nurses and other women who gave themselves up, entirely regardless of their own health, in some cases with fatal results, to alleviate the suffering of the men.\" After the war, she noted that \"when memorials on all sides were being erected to our brothers, I often thought that our sisters who also made the same sacrifice appeared to have been forgotten.\"\nFive Sisters window, York Minster\nThe Five Sisters window, York Minster\nMain article: Five Sisters window\nLittle first visited York Minster in 1909. She said the Five Sisters window, \"in its quaint simplicity, quiet dignity\", had made a lasting impression on her.\nLittle's vision\nOn 30 November 1922 Little had a vision. She detailed it in a letter which was published posthumously in The Times. In her vision she was in the Minster and saw two of her sisters, who had both died in infancy, pointing towards the Five Sisters window. It then moved, as if on hinges, to reveal a garden behind it. In the garden was a tree under which sat five women, all weaving. In the distance girls and women \"came gliding up the garden in misty grey-blue garments.\" The window then swung back into place with her sisters both still pointing at it. She woke up and cried out \"The Sisters Window for the sisters.\"\nOak panel listing women that died in munitions factories in WWI\nThis vision led Little to propose that the restoration of the Five Sisters window be completed in memory of the women of the Empire who gave their lives in service during WWI. (During the war the Minster's windows were removed for safety, when it was discovered they were in need of significant restoration.) The Dean immediately accepted her proposal and fundraising efforts began.\nLittle was the joint honourable secretary, together with Almyra Gray, for the fundraising effort for the Five Sisters window memorial. Within nine weeks, 32,000 people had donated a total of \u00a33,500 (equivalent to \u00a3165,000 in 2024). The window was reinstalled, together with ten oak panels listing the names of all the women who died in the line of service, and the dedication service was held in June 1925.\nAfter Little's death\nThe first part of Little's funeral took place at York Minster's Chapel of St Nicholas (which also forms part of the memorial). It was attended by the Yorkshire School for the Blind, the Voluntary Aid Detachment, the Primrose League, the County Hospital Linen Guild, the National Council of Women Workers and Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps. The subsequent part of the funeral was held in Winchester.\nAfter Little's death the executors of her will donated the archives of the Five Sisters fundraising effort to York Minster's archive.\nOther roles held by Little\nClifton Women's Conservative Association - chair\nConservative Women's Central Advisory Committee - chair\n",

    "\nHezbollah in Latin America is a splinter organization of the Shia Islamist Lebanon-based group Hezbollah which operates in throughout South America.\nHistory\nThe group was established in the 1980s in the tri-border region of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina which was considered a safe haven for the group's operations of smuggling, recruitment, and plotting of attacks. They expanded into Venezuela with some degree of sponsorship from the Venezuelan state. They also receive funding from the Iranian state in order to conduct operations against U.S. and Jewish interests in South America with many of the members of the group being Arab Muslims who either immigrated or were born in South America. The establishment was also seen as a way for Iran to get more leverage against the U.S., with this formation being taken as the setting up of a South American proxy terrorist network.\nIn 1994 the group bombed the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association building. Though a Palestinian Jihadist group took responsibility as a front for Hezbollah.\nTerrorism after October 7th\nAfter the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and throughout the Israel\u2013Hamas war there have been numerous attempts by Hezbollah in Latin American to commit terrorist attacks against Jewish and Israeli civilians in South America.\nIn November 2023 two men who had links to Hezbollah in Latin America and the main group of Hezbollah were arrested by Brazilian police. One of the men was arrested in the international airport in S\u00e3o Paulo after coming from Lebanon into Brazil. The plan that the men had was to attack Jewish communities in Brazil, but the plan was foiled with assistance from the Mossad intelligence agency. In addition to these arrests, the Brazilian police executed 11 search warrants in relation to the recruitment of extremists in Brazil.\nRevenue\nMost of the group's international revenue comes from Iran, with some funds being laundered from Venezuela. Some of the revenue that is gained by Hezbollah in Latin America goes towards the main group in Lebanon to make up for loss of funds in Lebanon. A lot of the funds they receive in South America come from the smuggling of illegal items through the tri-border of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay which is used to fund terroristic activities. Many of these items include drugs, stolen goods, weaponry, and pirated content. The group also funnels cocaine through Colombia and Venezuela. Selling illegal goods make up around 60-70% of all of the group's revenue.\nSanctions\nThe United States have issued many sanctions against the group, especially during the Trump Administration, but they have been more limited in South American compared to its Lebanese sector. Efforts were made by Trump to increase sanction against Hezbollah in Latin America more during his presidency.\n",

    "The 22nd Utah Territorial Legislature met in 1876. The regular election for the House of Representatives was held August 3, 1874. The regular election for the Territorial Council was held August 2, 1875.\nSession\nThe legislative session convened on January 10, 1876, at the City Hall in Salt Lake City, and ended on February 18, 1876.\nMembers\nThe House seat from Tooele was caught up in a general dispute over the 1874 election in that county. The Liberal Party, a rough coalition of disaffected Mormons allying with non-Mormon residents of the territory, achieved there its first notable victory over the People's Party supported by the Mormon establishment; the Liberal ticket prevailed in the official results, and Erastus S. Foote was chosen as the territorial House delegate over George Atkin. However, each side attacked the validity of the other's votes, keeping the outcome in doubt as further wrangling ensued.\nGeorge Atkin contested the Tooele election result and was seated as its House delegate halfway through the session\nThe Liberals argued that many votes for the People's ticket were illegal, having been cast by alien nationals. With a sizable portion of the Mormon population having immigrated from England, including some of its leaders (Atkin among them), this allegation might disqualify many voters and also render candidates ineligible to serve. Most claimed to be naturalized as Americans, but often had their papers issued by the county probate courts, whose jurisdiction to confer citizenship was further called into question.\nFor its part, the People's Party faction alleged that many voters were ineligible due to not meeting the requirement of being taxpayers and resident in Utah for six months. This particularly singled out the relatively transient mining settlements in Tooele County, largely non-Mormon districts that overwhelmingly provided the base of Liberal support. It was claimed that up to 80% of their votes should be disqualified. In response, the Liberals wished to assert that many miners were in fact residents, while the failure to enroll them as taxpayers was due to the negligence of territorial officials. They also questioned the treatment of women voters under the circumstances. The territorial legislature had granted women the right to vote in 1870, but they were not required to be on the tax lists, and most women voters were Mormon, in contrast to the predominantly male mining communities.\nThe federal appointees in the territory, Governor George L. Woods and Chief Justice James B. McKean of the Supreme Court, sided with the Liberals, so Foote was issued the certificate of election and presented himself at the opening of the legislative session. But the House of Representatives, claiming the power to ascertain the qualifications of its own members, opted to consider Atkin's suit to contest the result, and referred the matter to its Committee on Elections. After conducting an investigation, the committee in its report rejected a significant number of ballots for each side that were deemed illegal, but considerably more for Foote, with the result that the election was awarded to Atkin.\n",

She worked on the study of the Amazonian flora existing in Maranh\u00e3o, which allowed her to work on the manipulation of medicines used in treatments using plants. This work served as inspiration for the launch of the Maranh\u00e3o project Farm\u00e1cia Viva.\nFirst years\nBorn in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, on February 5, 1933, she was the daughter of Joaquim Pedro da Silva and Francisca da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Almeida Silva.\nShe was a student of Basic Education and Gymnasium at Col\u00e9gio Rosa Castro, where she began to develop a taste for science and plants. Secondary studies were completed at Liceu Maranhense.\nHer family owned a farm in the municipality of Cajapi\u00f3. Her grandfather was an Army colonel and Secretary of State, and was very interested in treatment through plants, always asking people what they took to cure an illness. Her grandfather was a great inspiration for her career, as well as her supporter, having given her her first scales to weigh materials collected in research to prepare medicines.\nIn 1955, she entered the undergraduate course in Pharmacy and Biochemistry (an isolated federal institution that would become part of the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o, created in 1966), having graduated in 1957.

The active ingredient was extracted from the selection of plants for the manufacture of natural medicines. There was also a concern about people who came from the countryside and were used to treating illnesses with herbs and could not find the same plants in the capital, having promoted the installation of medicinal gardens.\nTerezinha recognized the greater effectiveness of allopathic medicines, which gave faster responses, but considered that their side effects were stronger than herbal medicines, which could be used to treat some diseases.\nAcademic career\nIn 1959, she went to the University of S\u00e3o Paulo to pursue a doctorate in General Botany, returning in 1965 to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds.\nThe researcher achieved the title of associate professor in General Botany after three years at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), as a Capes scholarship holder, having completed her thesis \"Contribution to the morphological and anatomical recognition of Tagetes minuta L\" in 1977, which was defended at the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o (UFMA), becoming a professor in the university's Department of Pharmacy.\nThroughout her academic career, she published several books, reports and articles, such as: \"50 medicinal teas from the flora of Maranh\u00e3o\" and \"Phytogeography of medicinal plants in Maranh\u00e3o\", \"Survey of the flora of the Baixada Maranh\u00e3o\" (1977); \"Analysis of the fundamental characteristics of the Pre-Amazon\" (1980); \"Medicinal plants of the Maranh\u00e3o flora\" in UFMA research notebooks, 1985 and in \"Acta Amaz\u00f4nica\" (1977).\nIn January 1984, she created the \"\u00c1tico SEABRA\" herbarium at UFMA, where 10,800 species that characterize the flora of the state of Maranh\u00e3o were catalogued, with support from CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development). tinctures, ointments and syrups.\nShe also specialized in phytotherapy at the University of Havana, in Cuba, in addition to having trained in the Emergency Toxicological Chemistry Course, 1970; Biology Course, 1970; Update Course on Medication Analysis, at the \"I Maranh\u00e3o Congress of Pharmacists\", 1974; Botanical Systematics Course, 1976; Plant Anatomy Course, 1982, in Bras\u00edlia.\nShe retired from the university in 1991, but continued working as an advisor between 1999 and 2021, continuing with research, conferences, classes, and activities at the \"\u00c1tico Seabra\" Herbarium.\nRecognition and legacy\nAmong her main works, three herbal medicines are Ess\u00eancia de Cabacinha, Urucum Syrup and Assa-Peixe Tincture. Cabacinha Essence is the result of 20 years of research, being used to treat sinusitis, rhinitis and adenoid problems through the infusion of cabacinha fruit in alcohol. Terezinha Rego also did research on chanana, a yellow flower that has an energetic substance that can be used to improve the immune system, with its component being used in the treatment of cancer at the Aldenora Bello Hospital, in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds.\nFrom 2001 onwards, Chinese universities began to exchange with the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o (UFMA), with annatto syrup being used to combat Asian pneumonia (S",
    "Tang dynasty politician\nFang Yi'ai (Chinese: \u623f\u907a\u611b;\u00a0?\u2014 6 March 653), was a Tang dynasty politician who served as the governor of Fangzhou. He was the second son of Fang Xuanling, a prominent statesman who served as Chancellor under Emperor Taizong of Tang. Fang Yiai was married to Princess Gaoyang, the 17th daughter of Emperor Taizong.\nLife and career\nFang Yi'ai was a native of Qizhou, but his exact birth date is unknown, but it is believed to be sometime in the early 7th century. He was born into a prominent family, as his father, Fang Xuanling, was a highly respected official in the Tang court. Fang Yi'ai did not receive a well-rounded education but was skilled in martial arts.\nIn 648 CE, Fang Yi'ai was married to Princess Gaoyang, the 17th daughter of Emperor Taizong. The marriage between Fang Yi'ai and Princess Gaoyang was arranged by Emperor Taizong after the execution of Princess Gaoyang's lover, a monk named Bianji. Gaoyang became bitter after Bianji's death, and her betrothal and wedding went ahead despite her protests. However, instead of animosity and resentment, Gaoyang and Fang Yi'ai grew closer and bonded over their mutual hatred for the imperial court.\nAfter his marriage, Fang Yi'ai was appointed to a number of government positions. He served as a right-guard general and later as the governor of Fangzhou. In 653 CE, Fang Yi'ai was involved in a failed rebellion against Emperor Gaozong of Tang. The rebellion was orchestrated by his wife, Princess Gaoyang. However, the rebellion was swiftly suppressed, leading to Fang Yi'ai's death. Subsequently, Princess Gaoyang committed suicide upon the orders of her brother, Emperor Gaozong.\nXu Jingzong, a Tang dynasty historian, later commented on Fang Yi'ai's rebellion in the Old Book of Tang, stating, \"Fang Yi'ai is still a child at the breast, how could he conspire with women to rebel?\".\nCai Dongfan, a late Qing dynasty historian, commented on Fang Yi'ai's actions, stating, \"When discussing the princess's wrongdoing, Fang Yi'ai is the main subject. If Fang Yi'ai had been diligent in preventing idleness, how could the princess dare to indulge in wanton behavior? Even if a wife commits adultery, the husband bears the blame according to the laws.\" The authors traced the origin of the disaster to Wu Meiniang and Fang Yi'ai; subtly ridiculing them. This critique was not intended to excuse the prince and the princess but to highlight the corruption of women and the lack of moral principles in men, both of which are seen as causes of national downfall and family ruin.\nFang Yi'ai had a great-grandson named Fang Jiang, who had two sons, Fang Hui and Fang Xun. Fang Hui had a son named Fang Ning, whose courtesy name was Xuanjian, and who served as the governor of Yingzhou. Fang Xun had a son named Fang Kerang, who had two sons, Fang Ye and Fang Fu. Fang Ye's courtesy name was Zhengfeng. Fang Yiai's grandson, Fang Nu, later became an imperial censor.\nIn popular culture\nPortrayed by Pan Yueming in the 2001 Chinese TV series Love Legend of the Tang Dynasty\nPortrayed by Ye Peng in the 2006 Chinese TV series The Rise of the Tang Empire\nPortrayed by Bai Yunfei in the 2006 Chinese TV series Wu Zi Bei Ge\nPortrayed by Lou Yajiang in the 2014 Chinese TV series Heroes of Sui and Tang Dynasties\nPortrayed by Zhu Xiaohui in the 2014 Chinese TV series The Empress of China\n",

Alfred Brehm was born to Ludwig Brehm and his second wife Bertha Reiz who also raised Oskar.  Oskar became keenly interested in insects along with his father and went on hunting and bird study trips from an early age. He went to the village school and at 15 he apprenticed in the pharmacy in M\u00fcnchenbernsdorf (Thuringia). He collected nearly 1500 European beetles along with Rector L\u00fcbben from Aschersleben. In 1846 he went to study architecture in Dresden and also studied pharmacy at Jena and went to Heinrich Wackenroder's (1798\u20131854) private pharmaceutical-chemical institute. He interrupted his studies to join a trip with Baron von M\u00fcller to Africa along with his brother. The travel began in September 1847 and the first part ended in December 1848 and Alfred stayed in Egypt. A second part was from February 1850 to October 1851. Oskar joined the second part and was a specialist on the plants and insects. He initially went to Trieste where he met Reinhard Vierthaler (1820\u20131852) and they travelled together to Alexandria. Oskar has been identified as being particularly interested in insects but a number of later records have been confounded and ascribed to Alfred. When Oskar sent a shipment of pills to his brother, Oskar asked for a beetle in return for each pill. When Oskar joined on the second part of the trip he collected extensively and many of the new species were described by Johann Heinrich Gottfried Apetz. He joined up with Alfred on November 24, 1849, via Smyrna. A nine-member party set off to Sudan in December 1849. When they reached Dongola on May 8, 1850, Alfred and his brother went for a swim in the Nile and Oskar suddenly disappeared. His body was not found until half an hour later and attempts to resuscitate him failed. He was buried in a simple brick monument in the Coptic cemetery at Dongola.\n",

    "Spanish sociologist, journalist, activist\nEmilio Silva Barrera (born November 9, 1965, in Elizondo, Navarre) is a Spanish sociologist, journalist, and activist for the recovery of Historical Memory. He is one of the founders and president of the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (ARMH), a collective that has been searching for the mass graves of victims of repression in the Francoist zone during the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent Franco dictatorship.\nCareer\nThough he initially aspired to pursue poetry, Silva graduated in Sociology and Political Science from the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) and has dedicated most of his professional life to journalism. Within his journalistic career, he was the content director of the television program Caiga quien caiga during Manel Fuentes' tenure.\nIn the summer of 1999, he left his job to write a novel related to his family history during the repression unleashed by the Francoist troops and paramilitaries after the July 18, 1936 coup. In March 2000, following an interview with the communist militant and former political prisoner Arsenio Marco, he located in Priaranza del Bierzo (Le\u00f3n) the site where his grandfather, Emilio Silva Faba, had been buried in a mass grave along with twelve other men. They were all left-wing and republican militants murdered by Falangists on October 16, 1936, during the Spanish Civil War.\nIn September 2000, he published an article in La Cr\u00f3nica de Le\u00f3n titled: \"My grandfather was also a disappeared person.\" In it, he lamented how Spanish society celebrated the so-called Pinochet case while doing nothing to search for the thousands of men and women who had disappeared due to Francoist repression, murdered by Falangist paramilitaries who hid their bodies to multiply the pain of their families and to declare their belief that those who created Spain's first democratic period during the Second Spanish Republic should not have existed.\nFollowing the exhumation of the grave where the now-known \"thirteen of Priaranza\" were found, he founded, along with Palma Granados, Jorge L\u00f3pez, and Santiago Mac\u00edas, the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (ARMH), of which he is president. The association has been exclusively dedicated to searching for Republican disappeared persons, those who were not rescued by either Francoism or democracy. It has also been responsible for exhuming numerous mass graves and providing extensive documentation to people who have not known anything about their loved ones for decades.\nFrom 2007 to 2014, Silva worked as a political trust position for the mayor's office of the Madrid municipality of Rivas-Vaciamadrid. Additionally, he has worked as a journalist in various media outlets and is part of the team of the radio program La Cafetera de radiocable, directed by journalist Fernando Berl\u00edn, where Silva covers news related to Historical Memory. Due to his involvement in the recovery of Spain's Historical Memory and the exhumation processes of mass graves, Silva has appeared in several documentaries narrating these processes, such as Los caminos de la memoria (Jos\u00e9 Luis Pe\u00f1afuerte, Spain, 2009), premiered at the Valladolid International Film Festival as part of the official section, Lesa Humanidad (H\u00e9ctor Faver, Spain, 2017) and Bones of Contention (Bones of Contention, Andrea Weiss, United States, 2017).\nWorks\n2004 \u2013 La memoria de los olvidados: un debate sobre el silencio de la represi\u00f3n franquista.

    "Ukrainian-Argentine anarchist (1900\u20131935)\nEsther Porter (n\u00e9e\u00a0Polinska; c.\u20091900\u20131935) was a Ukrainian Jewish anarchist who was active in Argentina during the early 20th century. She participated in the events known as the Patagonia Rebelde and later became the mother of intellectuals Ismael\u00a0 and David Vi\u00f1as.\nBiography\nBackground\nEsther Polinska (Yiddish: \u05d0\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8 \u05e4\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05e1\u05e7\u05d0) came from a Ukrainian Jewish family that emigrated to Argentina in the mid-1900s, fleeing their home city of Odesa, which was a target of the pogroms in the Russian Empire. The family landed in Argentina after being denied entry to the United States because one member was ill. Because she emigrated as a child, aged about four or five, the youngest of four sisters, she retained little of her native language or culture as an adult. Upon entering Argentina, her father changed his surname from Polinsky to Portes.\nLife in Santa Cruz\nIn 1919, Porter moved to the city of R\u00edo Gallegos. She went there together with her partner, the radical lawyer Ismael Pedro Vi\u00f1as\u00a0, who was about 15 years her senior, who had been sent there as a judge-advocate. Vi\u00f1as was an influential figure in the local justice system, as he was the first to openly confront the estancieros, who held the de facto power in the territory of Santa Cruz. He was also a major player during the series of strikes and social conflicts that took place in Santa Cruz between 1920 and 1921, commonly known as the Patagonia Rebelde, which was repressed by the Argentine army, which killed roughly 1,500 rural workers.\nIn this sparsely populated town, located at the southern tip of Patagonia, the fact that the territory's legal judge was living with Esther Porter, without being married, was considered unheard of. This, together with some of Esther Porter's liberal attitudes, such as going to the cinema alone, meant that she was seen as a woman of advanced ideas. In turn, these attitudes and her anarchist ideas led to enmity between her partner and the interim governor Edelmiro Correa Falc\u00f3n\u00a0, who at the same time was secretary of the R\u00edo Gallegos Rural Society. This, together with the fact that Vi\u00f1as soon began to investigate acts of corruption involving some livestock companies and members of the territory's rural societies, led to a notorious institutional conflict between the governor's office and the court.\nAccording to Esther Porter's eldest son, it was she who made Vi\u00f1as aware of the injustices suffered by the Patagonian workers and the exploitation to which they were subjected by the big landowners:\nAccording to what my father told us much later, when my mother went to visit the prisoners in the police station, one of them  stood up, greeted her in Russian, kissed her hand in the most ceremonious European manner, and told her the 'truth'. That they were not criminals, but workers who had organised themselves to fight against exploitation, and that was why they had been arrested.\nFinal years in Monte\nPorter and Vi\u00f1as finally married in 1925, when she was pregnant with their first child, Ismael Vi\u00f1as\u00a0, who would grow up to become a writer and Marxist intellectual. The following year they moved to Buenos Aires. In 1927 their second son, David Vi\u00f1as, who would later become a renowned writer and literary critic, was born. Soon after, they moved to Monte, where they suffered political persecution from right-wing groups during the Infamous Decade. There, her children would recall that she defended her house from attacks by armed gangs, and confronted conservative supporters who harassed her husband, a known radical militant. In 1935 she died unexpectedly at the age of 35. \nLegacy\nEsther Porter's untimely death left a deep mark on her two sons, Ismael and David, which was reflected in their literary works and various interviews they gave throughout their lives. In the book Los due\u00f1os de la tierra by David Vi\u00f1as, one of the main and most important female characters, Yuda Singer, is clearly inspired by her. This was confirmed on several occasions by David Vi\u00f1as, who recognised several similarities between the two. In turn, this same character represents the ideological alter ego of Judge Vera, who is the main figure in the work, who has been interpreted as representing either his father or David's own alter ego. This author idealised the figure of his mother and her rebellious character, which is reflected not only in the female character in this book, but also in other literary works written by him.\nIn Osvaldo Bayer's work, La Patagonia Rebelde, Porter appears only as the partner of the judge Ismael Vi\u00f1as, depicted as not having play any significant role herself. However, according to her children, she played important an role in the events. When she died, several Santa Cruz workers who survived the army massacres sent her widower a bronze memorial plaque for her grave, but he refused to put it in place, for fear that it would be vandalised.\n",
    "Television in Catalonia, in reference to the autonomous community of Spain, is made up of television channels broadcast exclusively in Catalonia, whether for the whole of Catalonia or for certain regions and counties, as well as state-wide Spanish channels, which may or may not have disconnections from the general feed with exclusive programmes for Catalonia.\nProgramming on Catalan channels is mainly broadcast in one of the languages of Catalonia (Catalan and Aranese Occitan), although Castilian content is not subtitled or translated. Additionally, most Catalan channels and disconnected versions of Spain-wide channels are also watchable from Andorra and most of Northern Catalonia.\nThe first television broadcasts in Catalonia took place around the beginning of 1959, when the newly born Spanish television station Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola (TVE) arrived in the capital city of Barcelona. Catalan public broadcaster Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya (TVC) began broadcasting in 1983.\nHistory\nDuring the dictatorship\nTelevision broadcasts in Catalonia began in the late 1950s, under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Although Spanish broadcaster Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola had officially started operating on 28 October 1956, broadcasts were only visible on a small number of television sets, all of which were located in Madrid. It was not until 15 February 1959 that it arrived in Catalonia, when the city of Barcelona began broadcasts with a football match between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. Local headquarters, Miramar studios\u00a0, were established in the city on 14 July of the same year.\nDue to the strict repression and ban on Spanish languages other than Castilian under Franco's regime, no television programmes were initially broadcast in Catalan or Occitan. However, in 1964, the first ever official Catalan language broadcasts took place, when RTVE Catalunya\u00a0 began broadcasting some theatre programmes, such as Teatre Catal\u00e0. Most notably, the cultural programme Mare Nostrum was broadcast once a month from 1967 to 1973. 1975 saw the birth of Miramar, a territorial disconnection news programme for Catalonia, nowadays known as L'informatiu\u00a0.\nTransition\nAfter the passing of Franco and the transition to democracy, Catalan language broadcasts began becoming more common and accepted. Catalan-language programmes began to be broadcast on TVE on a daily basis, with territorial broadcasts being mostly in Catalan from 1977 onwards.\nOn 7 June 1980, Televisi\u00f3 de Cardedeu\u00a0, the first channel to broadcast entirely in Catalan, as well as the first local channel in Catalonia and in the whole of Spain, began broadcasting to the town of Cardedeu, in Vall\u00e8s Oriental county. It is a community channel that continues operating today. In 1983, RTVE's Catalan studios were moved from Barcelona to Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s (Vall\u00e8s Occidental), where they remain today.\nBirth of Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya\nMain article: Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya \u00a7\u00a0History\nTelevisi\u00f3 de Catalunya's first logo, used from 1983 to 1993\nOn 29 September 1982, the Executive Council of Catalonia approved the draft law for the creation of a radio entity and television for Catalonia. On 23 April 1983, coinciding with St Jordi's Day, the Catalan government launched an experimental broadcast, which would become the first from Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya (TVC), exclusively in the Eixample district of Barcelona.\nBroadcasts from the nascent Catalan flagship channel TV3 began on a test basis on 10 September 1983, a day before the National Day of Catalonia, this time reaching 70% of Catalonia. Regular broadcasts started on 16 January 1984, point in which Catalan news programme Telenot\u00edcies\u00a0 was also first aired. By late 1984, TV3 reached all of Catalonia, including part of Northern Catalonia. In April 1986, Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya opened its headquarters in Sant Joan Desp\u00ed (Baix Llobregat).\nOn 10 September 1988, TVC started test broadcasts for its second channel, El 33, beginning regular broadcasts just a year later. That same year, TVE started its first broadcasts in Occitan, with programme Era Lucana.\nOn 24 April 1989, TV3 began broadcasting Telenot\u00edcies comarques, offering local news for each of the Catalan regions. Special broadcasts for the Aran Valley (in Occitan) began every Friday in 1990.\nThe 1990s\nIn 1991, TVE channel La 2 began broadcasting The Simpsons with a Catalan-dubbed audio option for Catalonia. That same year, commercial broadcaster Antena 3 launched regional broadcasts for Catalonia, the only ones not in Castilian in the whole of Spain.\nOn 24 July 1992, TVC and TVE signed an agreement to launch Canal Ol\u00edmpic\u00a0, a channel entirely dedicated to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, replacing the frequency of El 33. It was restored to the original channel on 9 August.\nOn 3 November 1994, betev\u00e9, Barcelona's local television station, began broadcasting regular programmes, which can now be seen throughout the whole throughout Barcelon\u00e8s county.\nOn 10 November 1994, TV3 began broadcasting Poble Nou, its fir",

    "Scottish governance since 2024\nJohn Swinney's term as First Minister of Scotland began on 8 May 2024, when he was formally sworn into office at the Court of Session, upon Humza Yousaf's resignation.\nSwinney previously served as leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 2000 to 2004, when the party was in opposition. Yousaf announced his resignation as party leader and first minister on 29 April 2024, amid a government crisis. Swinney announced his leadership bid on 2 May, but faced potential leadership challenges from Kate Forbes and Graeme McCormick. Both candidates eventually decided not to stand and endorsed Swinney, who was therefore elected unopposed as the SNP party leader on 6 May.\nBackground\nMain articles: Bute House Agreement and 2024 Scottish government crisis\nFollowing the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP had been in a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. In April 2024, Yousaf terminated the agreement, following changes to landmark climate policy by M\u00e0iri McAllan, Cabinet Secretary for Wellbeing Economy, Net Zero and Energy. Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, co-leaders of the Greens, announced they would support a no confidence motion in Yousaf. Amid the crisis, Yousaf announced his resignation as party leader and first minister on 29 April.\nLeadership election\nMain article: 2024 Scottish National Party leadership election\nOn 2 May, Swinney launched his leadership bid, after Kate Forbes, who was a serious contender to become leader, declined to stand and endorsed him.\nGraeme McCormick announced he would challenge Swinney for the leadership, saying he had the 100 nominations on 5 May. Just hours later, he withdrew and endorsed Swinney, becoming the presumptive nominee.\nOn 6 May, with no other candidates put forward, Swinney was elected as party leader unopposed.\nTenure\nGovernment formation\nMain article: Swinney government\nSwinney's cabinet, pictured at Bute House on 8 May 2024.\nSwinney was officially sworn into office as First Minister of Scotland on 8 May 2024 at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after receiving the Royal Warrant of Appointment by King Charles III.\nThe majority of Swinney's cabinet were previously part of Humza Yousaf's previous governments. The only addition to the cabinet was Kate Forbes replacing Shona Robison as Deputy First Minister of Scotland, and taking part of M\u00e0iri McAllan's responsibility for economy into her portfolio as Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic. Robison was, however, re-appointed by Swinney as Finance Secretary with additional responsibility for local government, with McAllan appointed as the reduced portfolio of Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero and Energy.\nSwinney's cabinet met for the first time on 10 May 2024, with the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government John-Paul Marks and the Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain also attending the cabinet meeting. Speaking about the first meeting of his cabinet since becoming First Minister, Swinney said \"today, my colleagues and I embark on a new chapter as we collectively work to build a better, brighter future for the people of Scotland. It is my greatest honour to lead us forward on that journey \u2013 one that will drive economic growth, tackle the climate crisis and eradicate the scourge of child poverty in our country once and for all\".\nDebut First Ministers Questions\nThe first meeting of the Swinney government, 10 May 2024\nSwinney visits St John's Hospital, May 2024\nSwinney's first First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament as First Minister occurred on Thursday 9 May 2024, during which Swinney's record on education during his tenure as education secretary under former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was attacked by both Anas Sarwar (leader, Scottish Labour Party) and Douglas Ross (leader, Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party). Ross asked if Swinney would \"recommit to increasing teacher numbers by 3,500\", whilst Sarwar asked Swinney if he \"could save 450 Glasgow teachers whose jobs are under threat\". Swinney confirmed to the Scottish Parliament chamber that, as First Minister, he would work with local councils to \"deliver on education\".\nHis decision to appoint Kate Forbes as the Deputy First Minister was criticised by Patrick Harvie, the co\u2013leader of the Scottish Greens, who asked if the SNP was going back to \"the repressive values of 1950s with the return of Kate Forbes to the cabinet\". Swinney was dismissive of the claims made by Harvie and defended his decision on appointing Forbes as Deputy First Minister, claiming that Forbes \"had delivered progressive taxation when she was finance secretary\".\nFirst actions\nUpon becoming First Minister, Swinney addressed issues within NHS Scotland, the country's national health service. He recognised that the NHS in Scotland is \"operating under sustained pressure\", further adding that \" I am absolutely committed to working with health boards to improve standards \u2013 starting with our recent \u00a330 million investment to drive down waiti",
    "Kashmiri Sufi\nMir Sayyid Hussain Simnani Dargah\nMir Syed Hussain Simnani was an Indian Sufi saint from the 8th century Hijri, known for his role in the spread of Islam in the Kashmir Valley. He hailed from Simnan in Iran and is celebrated for his philanthropic mission and spiritual teachings in South Kashmir's Kulgam district. He is a descendant of the Muhammad through his grandson Imam Hussain, being the 16th in direct descent from Ali. He was the cousin of the Sufi saint Mir Syed Ali Hamdani and the younger brother of Syed Taj ud Din Hamdani.\nEarly life and background\nHis arrival in Kashmir, along with other Sayyids during the reign of Sultan Shahab ud din, greatly influenced the region's religious landscape. He chose Kulgam as his permanent abode, where he was engaged in spreading Islam and was eventually buried at a spot on a cliff overlooking the river Veshaw.\nSpiritual life\nHe played a significant role in the spread of Islam in Kashmir through his missionary work and spiritual influence. Here are some key contributions he made:\nMissionary Work: He was part of a group of hundreds of missionaries who accompanied Mir Syed Ali Hamdani to propagate Islam in Kashmir. His efforts gave a considerable boost to the conversion of the people of the valley to Islam.\nSpiritual Influence: He was known for his piety, abstinence, and spiritual powers. His presence and teachings had a profound impact on the local population, leading many to embrace Islam.\nPhilanthropic Mission: He engaged in philanthropic activities in Kulgam, which helped in establishing a positive image of Islam and its teachings among the local communities.\nCultural Integration: He connected the global mystical culture of Islam, or Tasawwuf, with the local mystic culture of Kashmir, known as Rishism. This integration resulted in the permanence and dominance of a unique Islamic mystical culture in the region.\nRoyal Influence: Sultan Shahab ud din, the ruler of Kashmir at the time, became a follower of Mir Syed Hussain Simnani, which likely facilitated the spread of Islam due to the king's endorsement.\nHis legacy is still celebrated today, and his shrine in Kulgam remains a place of pilgrimage for many devotees.\nWorks\nHe is attributed to the book titled \"Hazrat Mir Sayid Muhammad Hussain Simnani\u00a0: Qalandar-i-Sadat\". This book provides insights into his life, his journey to Kashmir, his role in reforming the thoughts and actions of the Sultans of Kashmir, and his efforts in relieving locals from superstitious beliefs through his preaching and miraculous powers. It's a valuable resource for those interested in the history of Sufism and the spread of Islam in Kashmir.\n",

Currently, this outlet is active on social networks such as Telegram, Instagram, and Twitter.\nAmirkabir NewsLetter has formed at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). This online outlet is active in the areas of student human rights issues, documenting human rights violations in Iranian universities, reporting on the status of universities, publishing news and analyses related to security crackdowns in Iranian universities, and publishing critical articles on the performance of the Islamic Republic in the field of higher education centers in Iran.\nHistory\nThe history of Amirkabir NewsLetter dates back to its origins as the newsletter of the Islamic Association of Amirkabir Students (Polytechnic Association), known initially as AKU-News and published in paper form. This media outlet was formed by activists of the student movement at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), with the assistance of members of the Office for Strengthening Unity, and each year, with the selection of a new central council for the Polytechnic Association, its editorial board members were determined. In Khordad 1385 (May/June 2006), the responsible person for the Amirkabir NewsLetter website and the secretary of the Islamic Association of Polytechnic were detained by the Ministry of Intelligence of the Islamic Republic. One of the charges against the responsible person of the newsletter was launching the Amirkabir NewsLetter website, for which they were sentenced to two years of imprisonment and 148 lashes.\nActivities\nFollowing the nocturnal destruction of the Polytechnic Association office with a bulldozer and security crackdowns on the students of this university, Amirkabir NewsLetter continued its activities unofficially. It became one of the influential media outlets of the Iranian student movement in the latter half of the 2000s. With the arrest of several Polytechnic students in the case of Amirkabir NewsLetter organizers in 2008 and the blocking of Amirkabir NewsLetter coinciding with the blocking of Facebook prior to the presidential elections in 2009, the activities of this outlet decreased.\nAmirkabir NewsLetter resumed its activities in 2015 through its Telegram channel. Its activities intensified concurrently with the emergence of the Women-Life-Freedom uprising. By publishing various reports on the situation of Iranian universities and the suppression of universities, including Amirkabir University of Technology, it shed light on human rights violations in Iranian universities at the international level.\nDuring the summer and fall of 2023, Amirkabir NewsLetter released classified documents regarding the recruitment of faculty members in line with the Islamic Revolution (aligned with the Islamic Regime's policies) in universities, triggering widespread reactions. The publication of a list of 2843 summoned students to disciplinary committees of various universities at the request of security institutions is another document published by this outlet. These incidents have been reflected in the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Committee.\nCyber Attack\nOn February 5, 2010 (16 Bahman 1388), Amirkabir NewsLetter, along with Advar News, the media of Generations of the office of Strengthening of Unity (also known as the Organization of Islamic Iran's Graduates), came under attack by government hackers known as \"Iran Cyber Army\" and went offline. In their message, the hackers wrote: \"If the Leader (the Islamic Republic\u2019s supreme leader) commands, we will rise; if he wishes, we will give our heads for him.\"\nSee also\nAmirkabir University of Technology\n",

    "French video game publishing and distribution company\nNobilis was a French video game publishing and distribution company founded in 2001 in the Lyon metropolitan area and dissolved in 2013. Nobilis also distributed and produced accessories for consoles under the Subsonic brand, whose activity continued after the judicial liquidation of Nobilis.\nHistory\nOrigins and development\nNobilis was founded in 2001 in the Lyon metropolitan area by Arnaud Blacher, Pierre de Laporte, and Eric Pernelle, three former directors of Infogrames (now Atari SA). The company's headquarters were initially located in Champagne-au-Mont-d'Or, then moved to Dardilly and a few years later to Limonest.\nAs a public limited company, the company was a publisher and distributor of video games for PC and consoles (Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, Nintendo Wii, PSP, GameCube, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance). The company also distributed and produced accessories for consoles under the Subsonic brand, particularly for Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii, GameCube, PSP, and Nintendo DS platforms.\nDuring its early years, Nobilis experienced rapid growth in its business. The company recorded a turnover of 3.5 million euros in its first fiscal year. By 2003, the company employed 30 people with an annual turnover of 16 million euros. In 2005, the company achieved a turnover of 20 million euros and claimed to have been profitable since its inception. In the context of this rapid expansion, Nobilis opened subsidiaries in Madrid, Brussels, and Rome.\nFinancial difficulties and liquidation\nIn 2009, Nobilis faced financial difficulties in a deteriorating video game market in France, particularly in the Nintendo DS game distribution segment. Between late 2008 and summer 2009, Nobilis canceled six publishing projects commissioned to development studios and laid off 15 to 20% of its 65 employees, in addition to voluntary departures. Two members of Nobilis affected by this wave of departures founded the publishing company Zallag at that time.\nIn early 2011, Nobilis announced a strategic reorientation of its activities, focusing on the distribution of console accessories and the publishing of digital video games accessible via a web browser. The accessory distribution business was profitable: in the 2010\u20132011 fiscal year, Subsonic generated an annual pre-tax profit of \u20ac426,000.\nDespite this strategic reorientation, Nobilis was placed in receivership in September 2011. Unable to find a solution for takeover, the company underwent judicial liquidation on March 8, 2013, ceasing its activities. The Subsonic brand, which was generating profitable activity, was preserved by being transformed into a separate company. Arnaud Blacher, Pierre de Laporte, and Eric Pernelle retained management positions within Subsonic after Nobilis' liquidation.\nPublished and Distributed Games\nAccording to the database of JeuxVideo.fr, Nobilis would have published and/or distributed a total of 206 video game titles between 2001 and 2010.

    "Historic city hall in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Poland\nThe Bielsko-Bia\u0142a City Hall is a Neo-Renaissance, historic city hall located at City Hall Square in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, administratively within the boundaries of the Bia\u0142a \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie district and within the registration area of Bia\u0142a Miasto. It was built between 1895 and 1897 according to the design by Emanuel Rost. Originally, it housed the city hall of Bia\u0142a, the Communal Savings Bank, as well as several other institutions and apartments for officials. Since 1951, it has been the seat of the Mayor, the City Council, and some departments of the Municipal Office in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a.\nHistory\nIn the 1890s, the Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bia\u0142a recognized that the city hall, built in 1827 and situated in the market square (nowadays Wojska Polskiego Square), was insufficient for the rapidly developing city. It was decided to construct a new building, with sponsorship secured from the Communal Savings Bank, a local bank founded in 1883.\nIn February 1894, the management of the Communal Savings Bank announced an architectural competition for the design of the building, which was intended to serve a dual function \u2013 housing the bank's headquarters and the city hall. The competition requirements precisely defined the expectations for the modern building, emphasizing both functionality and the grandeur of the city hall. It was to be a municipal public building with a recognizable landmark tower with a clock. The organization of the competition was entrusted to the Austrian Association of Engineers and Architects (German: \u00d6sterreichischer Ingenieur- und Architektenverein). The jury consisted of three Viennese architects: Ludwig W\u00e4chtler, Franz Neumann, and Herman Helmer.\nUnrealized project of the City Hall in Bia\u0142a by Carl Korn\nOn 24 July 1894, the jury selected the winning design for execution from eight proposals. Only two of them are known today: the project under the slogan Honoris Causa by Carl Korn and Coalition 2 by Emanuel Rost. Rost's project won the competition and was chosen for implementation, undergoing several post-competition revisions and changes. Korn's proposal ranked second, probably due to the building's excessive size and the absence of the tower, which was stipulated in the competition conditions.\nConstruction work began on 1 September 1895, and was completed on 30 September 1897. Ignatz Ungwer supervised the construction. The construction costs, initially estimated at 200,000 Austro-Hungarian krones, eventually amounted to 612,000 krones. The Communal Savings Bank and the municipal authorities, led by Mayor Johann Rosner, moved into the new building on 17 October 1897. Soon after, it also became the headquarters of the police and a 20-person municipal guard unit, with a prison located in the basement. The Civic Society occupied one room, next to which, founded on 3 December 1904, was the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Museum and Castle. The top floor was designated for officials' residences. A municipal park was established west of the building in 1897.\nDue to the lack of space in the cramped urban structures of Bia\u0142a, the city hall was erected on sparsely built land south of the city center, at the confluence of the Bia\u0142a and Niwka rivers, near Feuerwehrplatz (Fire Brigade Square). The location of the building also had an ideological aspect. It was adjacent to the Lipnik Manor, the former seat of the Lipnik starostas, on whom the citizens of Bia\u0142a were dependent in the 18th century. The imposing building clearly overshadowed the starostas' manor, which a few years earlier, in 1893, had been transferred by Archduke Albrecht to the convent sisters for use as a monastery and school. The city hall thus became a manifestation of local self-government, which in the 19th century overcame the feudal system.\nIn 1951, with the merger of Bielsko and Bia\u0142a into one city, the former Bia\u0142a city hall became the seat of the Mayor, the Municipal Office (currently some offices, including the Customer Service Office, are located in buildings at 6 and 7 City Hall Square), and the Municipal Council of Bielsko-Bia\u0142a.\nIn 1993, conservation work began on the clock tower and roof. Two years earlier, in 1991, the old clock on the tower was replaced with a new electronic one, while the former historic clock was handed over to a museum. The main restoration work, however, took place in between 1996 and 1997, and included both the facade and the interiors. On the centenary of its existence, the city hall was restored to its original 19th-century appearance, largely based on old photographs and Emanuel Rost's design drawings.\nIn April 2008, the National Bank of Poland issued a commemorative coin from the series 32 Historic Cities of Poland with a face value of 2 PLN, featuring an image of the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a City Hall on the reverse side. In 2009, the Bielsko-Bia\u0142a City Hall was featured on a postcard representing the country during the Eurovision Song Contest.\nArchitecture\nThe building covers an area o",

    "Former stadium in Scunthorpe, England\nAshby Ville Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, owned by North Lincolnshire Council and primarily used for motorcycle speedway and stock car racing.\nHistory\nDuring the 1978 National League season, the Scunthorpe Saints speedway team were told to vacate the Quibell Park Stadium by North Lincolnshire Council. Ongoing issues surrounding the track and conflict with the athletics club had led to the speedway promoter Brian Osborn looking for a new home even before being evicted. Osborn brought in fellow promoters Ted Hornsby and Jim Streets to help with the transition.\nThe search for a new site for the 1979 season ended when the North Lincolnshire Council agreed to the building of a stadium on a seven-acre area of land in the south east of Scunthorpe, near the cooling towers of the steelworks. The area was known as Ashby Ville due to the name of the nearby lake. The construction started in early part of 1979, with floodlights and a portable stand being added in an attempt to get the stadium ready for an Easter opening.\nAfter a successful application to the Speedway Control Board for a licence, the stadium duly opened by Easter, with the first fixture being held on 6 May 1979, featuring a challenge match against Middlesbrough Bears. The speedway team changed their name from the Saints to the Stags to mark the new era.\nIn January 1985, the now speedway promoter Tony Nicholls secured a 35-year freehold lease and announced optimistic plans to build an auction centre, restaurant and transport cafe and also bring stockcars and BMX racing to Ashby Ville. However, although work started on improving the facilities, Nicholls ran into financial problems and the speedway team was disbanded during May 1985.\nDespite the end of speedway at the venue, it still held BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars and there were hopes to introduce greyhound racing. The Borough council repossessed the site from Nicholls, who had debts of over \u00a310,000 with them.\nThe stadium then sat empty for several years and was marked as a possible venue for a new football stadium for Scunthorpe United in 1986 and as a music concert venue in 1988. It also served as a home venue for the Scunthorpe Steelers American Football team in the late 1980s and as a banger racing circuit in the early 1990s.\nBy 1992, the stadium was earmarked for demolition because plans for a new shopping centre materialised. The Lakeside shopping complex was subsequently constructed and the stadium demolished in 1993.\n",

    "Indian politician (1922-74)\nSahdeo Mahato was an Indian independence activist and politician from Bihar, who served as member of Bihar Legislative Assembly for five terms. He was a prominent leader of Indian National Congress in the Samastipur district. Mahato also served in several ministerial offices in his long political career of three decades.\nLife and career\nMahato was born in a Koeri family in 1922 in Haripur village, in Rosera police station area of Darbhanga district of contemporary Bihar province in British India.  His father was a farmer and as per tradition of those times, his initial education took place at his home. Later, he was enrolled in a primary school at Bhirha. After completing his middle school education, he passed matriculation from Rosera High school. He completed his Intermediate from Chandradhari Mithila college. By this time the Quit India movement of 1942 was launched in India. He participated in this movement as a student and to escape the colonial police he had to seek refuge in the home of his maternal grandparents.\nBy 1950, he completed his graduation from Arrah college and also completed his master's degree in political science. He also took the bachelor's degree in law. After Indian independence, he started practicing as a lawyer. In 1950s, he worked as lawyer in Samastipur district court.

    "Bangladeshi cameraman\nAmjad Ali Khandkar is a Bangladeshi cameraman and videographer of the Bangladesh Television. He is known for recording the speech delivered on 7 March, 1971 by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\nHe was awarded the 2022 Ekushey Padak for his contributions to the Liberation War.\nCareer\nAmjad Ali was born in Harirampur Upazila of Manikganj. Currently, he lives in Genda area of Savar Upazila.\nIn 1968, he got a job in the film division of the Film Development Corporation of the Ministry of Information. In 1971, he recorded the March 7 speech on the instructions of the then director of the film division, Abul Khair. On the day of Bangabandhu's homecoming, he went to house Dhanmondi 32 and filmed. He also filmed the death scene of Bangabandhu's mother. On 29 June 2004, he retired as Controller-Chief Cameraman of Bangladesh Television.\nSpeech delivered on 7 March 1971\nOn 7 March 1971, Bangabandhu's desired speech was banned on radio and television. Ignoring that ban, some people recorded and saved the speech. One of them is Amjad Ali Khandkar of Savar. In 1971, he was an assistant cameraman in the film department. In 1971, some of them recorded Bangabandhu's 7 March speech. After the recording, the recorded film of the speech was kept in the office that night. As there was no lab in the office at that time, the film was printed from FDC. After the Pakistani attack on 25 March, director Abul Khair called him on 9 April and asked him to take a black 42-inch trunk (box) out of Dhaka. In that trunk were some photographs of Bangabandhu and a video cassette of his 7 March speech. He took that trunk and went out through the second gate of the secretariat with the help of a Bengali officer. He risked his life and reached Swarighat in front of the Pakistan Army. He crossed the river with the trunk. After he reached Jinjira, he climbed on the roof of a bus from the bus stand and got down to a bus stand in Buxganj. As there was no vehicle there, he lifted the trunk on a horse and walked himself to Majid Darogar's house, which is about 4 to 5 kilometers away, in Joypara village of Dohar thana and kept the trunk. In the meantime, as the Pakistani army had reached Doha, they hid the trunk inside the big paddy field of two brothers named Amed Khan and Danesh Khan of Charkosha village further from Doha. Later, Abul Khair went to India and contacted the Indian High Commission and Mukti Bahini and he took the trunk from that paddy field and sent it to India through Mukti Bahini. The video cassette of Bangabandhu's March 7 speech was in India during the liberation war. After the independence of the country, when Abul Khair returned to the country, he brought it with him.\n",
    "1960s to 1980s.\n1980s to 1990s.\n1990s.Internal movement in Brazil\nInternal migration in Brazil occurs mainly for economic reasons and ecological disasters. Internal migration involves the movement of people within the same territory, which can be between regions, states or municipalities. It does not affect the total number of inhabitants in a country, but it does change the regions involved in this process. In Brazil, economic factors exert the greatest influence on migratory flows, as the capitalist production model creates privileged areas for industries, forcing people to move from one place to another in search of better living conditions and jobs to meet their basic survival needs.\nSome examples of internal migration in Brazil occurred in the 1960s, when the droughts devastated the Northeast of Brazil, leading thousands of people to abandon their homes in the Brazilian hinterland due to the lack of agricultural alternatives and social policies in the region. At the end of the 19th century, northeasterners migrated to the North of Brazil because of the rubber cycle. \nIn the 1970s, migrants from the Northeast and the South left in search of a better life in the Southeast, Brazil's only industrial center at the time.\nHistory\nMigration across Brazilian territory has been associated with economic factors since the time of colonization by Europeans. At the end of the 18th century, after the end of the sugar cane cycle in the Northeast and the beginning of the gold cycle in Minas Gerais and Goi\u00e1s, there was a huge movement of people towards Brazil's new economic center. At the end of the 19th century, the rubber cycle attracted a large number of migrants to the Amazon region. At the time, the coffee cycle and the industrialization process made the Southeast a major attraction for migrants, who left their region in search of jobs or better salaries.\nThe process of large-scale rural exodus has intensified. In rural areas, misery and poverty, aggravated by the lack of infrastructure, the concentration of land and the mechanization of agricultural activities, lead the large rural population to be attracted by the prospect of an urban job to improve their standard of living. In addition, access to services and commerce in urban areas has become the main factor attracting people to the big cities.\nBetween the 1940s and 1990s, the cities had no supply of jobs to match demand and the urban economy expanded at the same rate as migration. As a result, unemployment and underemployment in the service sector grew due to the increase in the number of informal workers and street vendors. The lack of investment and planning in urban infrastructure contributed to the emergence of slums and urban invasions. Currently, the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro register a greater outflow of population from the metropolises towards the medium-sized cities of the interior. Cities in the countryside, besides experiencing a period of economic growth, offer a better quality of life to the population.\nFrom the 1970s onwards, the North and Central-West regions became the focus of internal migration, reflecting the March to the West policy that began in the 1940s, the incentives offered by jobs in the region and the construction of Brasilia in 1960. Today, the majority of migrations occur within the same region. In addition, some states, which traditionally had more emigration, have become regions of immigration, such as Pernambuco, Bahia, Cear\u00e1, Para\u00edba and Rio Grande do Norte.\nSee also\nBrazilian northeastern migration\nDemographics of Brazil\n",

Dinar\u00e9s encouraged her to talk to Montal, who was positive if ambiguous, saying that FC Barcelona would support a women's team if she had one; word of her plan reached the Barcelona fan magazine Revista Barcelonista, who suggested she run a notice in the magazine asking for players, the same tactic used by Joan Gamper to form FC Barcelona.\nCabecer\u00e1n and the trophy are lifted by the Selecci\u00f3 Barcelona team after their inaugural match\nCabecer\u00e1n was the first captain of Barcelona Femen\u00ed, known in their first match on Christmas Day 1970 as Selecci\u00f3 Ciutat de Barcelona. She played as a false 9 in the game, which ended in a 0\u20130 draw and went to a penalty shoot-out that saw each team shoot rounds of three penalties: Cabecer\u00e1n converted both of her penalty kicks to take the shoot-out to sudden death, with Maite Rodr\u00edguez scoring to win for Barcelona. Cabecer\u00e1n was then handed the trophy to a standing ovation from the 60,000 crowd at the Camp Nou. She lined up as a centre forward in Barcelona's next match, on Three Kings' Day 1971, not scoring in the 1\u20132 loss.\nBy this point, Barcelona had rapidly become the most popular women's football team, and were one of the four major Catalan teams to take part in the Copa Catalunya Pernod in March 1971 \u2013 now known as Penya Femenina Barcelonista, although promoted as C.F. Barcelona. They lost 1\u20132 in the cup final against rivals Espanyol at the Camp Nou. Cabecer\u00e1n's only confirmed goal for Barcelona was scored in their second match of the 1971\u201372 league (the Campeonato de Catalu\u00f1a), a 16\u20130 victory over Calella on 16 May 1971. This scoreline led Barcelona to pack out the away stadium for their next match, and to become known as \"unbeatable\"; they were still unbeaten in the league by 23 June 1971, when Cabecer\u00e1n announced that she was \"hanging up her boots\" and leaving football. Due to her impact on the sport and individual popularity, Mundo Deportivo wrote that her contributions would always stay in the memories of fans.\nLater life\nShe married Garc\u00eda Castany in 1971, becoming a housewife. They had two daughters, Patricia (b. ~1973) and Ana (b. 1975), who both played football in Vidreres; Ana Garc\u00eda-Castany Cabecer\u00e1n went on to be a professional football goalkeeper for teams including Espanyol and, later, was a local politician in Lloret de Mar.\nCabecer\u00e1n died on 11 January 2018, aged 65, in Girona. A minute of silence was held before the Barcelona Femen\u00ed match on 14 January 2018. In April 2024, football journalist and Barcelona historian Guillem Balagu\u00e9 proposed that the women's Joan Gamper Trophy be renamed the Imma Cabecer\u00e1n Trophy.\n",
    "Incumbent Scottish Government since 2024\nJohn Swinney formed the Swinney government on 8 May 2024, following his appointment as first minister of Scotland at the Court of Session.\nHistory\nOn 29 April 2024, Humza Yousaf announced his intention to resign the leadership of the Scottish National Party, and as First Minister. Swinney announced his candidacy for the internal leadership contest, and was elected unopposed. Shona Robison resigned as Deputy First Minister on 8 May in favour of Kate Forbes, but was re-appointed as Swinney's Finance Secretary with additional responsibility for local government.\nThe majority of Swinney's cabinet was previously part of Humza Yousaf's previous governments. The only addition to the cabinet was Kate Forbes replacing Shona Robinson as Deputy First Minister of Scotland, and taking part of M\u00e0iri McAllan's responsibility for economy into her portfolio as Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic. Robinson was, however, re-appointed by Swinney as Finance Secretary with additional responsibility for local government, with McAllan appointed as the reduced portfolio of Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero and Energy.\nAdditionally, only one new junior minister joined Swinney's government, former minister Ivan McKee, with the number of junior ministerial posts being reduced from 16 to 14. The portfolio of Minister for Employment and Investment was created, with Tom Arthur appointed to the role. The ministers for independence and culture were abolished, with their incumbents Jamie Hepburn and Kaukab Stewart moved to other positions. Joe FitzPatrick's local government position was abolished, and he therefore departed government along with Equalities Minister Emma Roddick and Parliamentary Business Minister George Adam.\nThe Scottish Parliament formally approved the appointments of Kate Forbes and Ivan McKee on 9 May 2024.\nCabinet\nMay 2024 \u2013 present\nList of junior ministers\nMay 2024 to present\nScottish law officers\nNotes\n^ Robison previously held the Finance portfolio since March 2023 but gained the additional portfolio of Local Government in May 2024\n^ Portfolio was titled Cabinet Secretary for NHS Recovery, Health and Social Care from 8 February 2024 to 8 May 2024\n^ McAllan had additional responsibility for the Economy from 8 February 2024 until this was shuffled to Kate Forbes on 8 May 2024\n",
    "2023 new road infrastructure review in Wales\nLee Waters, Deputy Minister for Climate Change, commissioned the review.\nOn 14 February 2023, The Future of Road Investment in Wales report was published by the Welsh Government. The report concluded a period of reassessment on the government's existing commitments to Wales' road infrastructure and how it matched new government policy. It is commonly shortened as the Welsh Government's roads review.\nMost existing road infrastructure projects were either cancelled, paused for modification, or replaced with an alternative. Those cancelled, included most of the major proposed projects, such as the Third Menai Crossing and Flintshire Red Route.\nBackground and history\nSurface transport emissions are the third-largest source of Wales' carbon emissions, although the Committee on Climate Change described Wales' emissions as having been \"virtually flat\" since 1990. First Minister Mark Drakeford stated transport emissions accounted for 15% of Wales' emissions and has been the \"most stubborn sector\" to reduce them.\nIn 2019, the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency, and set 2050 as a target date for Wales to achieve net zero emissions; significant policy changes, compared to those in place when many of the road investment scheme were first conceived. In its 2021 Llwybr Newydd, Wales' transport strategy, the government plans a \"new path\" on policy, focusing on reducing the need for travel and supporting travel that is sustainable. An updated land-use planning policy would complement the transport strategy, and embed a \"sustainable transport hierarchy\". The Net Zero Plan and the strategy aim for passenger transport emissions to be reduced by 22% between 2019 and 2024, and by 98% by 2050. Both call for miles driven by cars to be reduced by 10% by 2030, and for active travel and public transport to account for an increased modal share of 39% by 2030 and 45% by 2040.\nThe actions required to meet these commitments were stated to be \"huge\", with the Senedd's Climate Change Environment and Infrastructure Committee stating in October 2022, that the modal share targets were not backed up by tools that can ensure the pledges can be delivered. Another report said that the Welsh government's pre-existing policy would have only delivered \"just over one fifth\" of the changes to modal shift needed for net zero.\nHistory\nIn June 2021, Deputy Minister for Climate Change, Lee Waters, announced the review of funding for new road schemes by the Welsh Government. Therefore, work on new schemes would be paused for the review. Projects that were already underway at the time of the announcement would still continue, such as the Heads of the Valleys road in South Wales.\nIn September 2022, the panel submitted their final report to the Welsh Government. It was published on 14 February 2023.\nAims\nThe Welsh Government stated it commissioned the roads review for the following reasons:\nEnsuring road investment assists the government's delivery of their transport strategy, government programme, and Net Zero aims for Wales\nDevelop new criteria for when new road building is needed\nUse such new criteria to decide whether existing projects should be supported, altered or scrapped\nGuide the government on when to reallocate road space on the road network which might benefit from future enhancement\nLook into making savings on road investment while ensuring road issues are addressed, and how to address the backlog of road maintenance\nIt was also stated that the review looked into whether roads also aligned with government policies, and overall being good, concerning the environment, communities, places, people, culture, the Welsh language, and the economy.\nReview\nProcess\nThe review was conducted by a panel comprising those from the transport policy, highway engineering, climate change, and freight/logistics sectors. The panel's chair was Lynn Sloman.\nThe panel identified and reviewed 59 schemes. Eight were later dropped due to their insufficient information, or the projects were out of the review's scope. Therefore, 46 schemes made it to the final decision stage of the review.\nReview panel\nThe roads review panel was appointed by Lee Waters, deputy minister for climate change in September 2021.\nThe panel consisted of:\nLynn Sloman (chair)\nJulie Hunt (Civil engineer and Chartered Institution of Highways and Transport Cymru Wales chair)\nGlenn Lyons (Future mobility professor at University of the West of England)\nGeoff Ogden (Director at Transport for Wales)\nJohn Parkin (Transport professor at University of the West of England)\nAndrew Potter (Cardiff Business School)\nHelen Pye (Snowdonia National Park Authority)\nEurgain Powell (Public Health Wales)\nSecretariats to the panel included:\nMatt Jones (Welsh Government)\nNatasha McCarthy (Transport for Wales)\nJanice Hughes\nMatt Fry and Arcadis\nRob Kent-Smith (Welsh Government liaison; review sponsor)\nFindings\nThe report set out two main recommendations, that new future ",
    "\nAlexander Clifford Vernon Melbourne (10 June 1888 \u2013 7 January 1943) was an Australian historian and writer. He had a long involvement with the University of Queensland as a lecturer and associate professor in history. Initially concentrating on Australian constitutional history, he later developed an interest in international relations and foreign policy, notably Australia\u2013China and Australia\u2013Japan relations.\nEarly life\nMelbourne was born on 10 June 1888 in Hackney, South Australia. He was the son of Elizabeth Agnes (n\u00e9e Braidwood) and William Clifford Melbourne; his father was a printer and trade union official.\nMelbourne attended Norwood Public School and then trained as a pupil-teacher, teaching at Unley Public School for three years. He went on to attend the University of Adelaide, graduating in 1910 with honours in history.\nCareer\nEarly career and military service\nMelbourne as a soldier c. 1915\nIn 1913, Melbourne moved to Brisbane and joined the University of Queensland's history and economics department as a temporary assistant lecturer. He was a founding member of the Historical Society of Queensland, serving as its inaugural honorary secretary and delivering the inaugural address at its first meeting. The paper he presented was titled \"Methods of Historical Research\" and has been described as \"probably the first time a professional\nhistorian spoke and wrote about historiography in Queensland\".\nMelbourne enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in August 1914 as a captain in the 9th Battalion. He served on the Gallipoli campaign and was wounded in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, receiving a further injury in June 1915. He was invalided back to Australia in October 1915 and returned to the University of Queensland, also undertaking work in wartime censorship.\nAcademia\nIn 1919, Melbourne was appointed as a lecturer in history and industrial history at the University of Queensland. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the university's newly created professorial chair in history in 1924, losing out to Henry Alcock. He later made unsuccessful applications for professorships at the University of Sydney (1929), University of Adelaide (1934), and University of Melbourne (1937).\nMelbourne was eventually elevated to the rank of associate professor at the University of Queensland in the 1930s. He served on the university's academic senate from 1926 to 1928 and from 1932 to 1943, and was heavily involved in the planning of the new campus at St Lucia. He was remembered by vice-chancellor John Douglas Story as \"one of the most virile and progressive members of the Senate\".\nPublications\nMelbourne's early interests were in Australian constitutional history. He completed a Master of Arts at the University of Adelaide in 1921, with a thesis on the constitutional development of Queensland. In 1925 he began writing Queensland History, a serialised column published in the Daily Mail and intended for publication as a book, which never eventuated. In 1928, Melbourne was awarded a Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial fellowship to study in England, completing a Ph.D. under A. P. Newton in 1930. He subsequently contributed two chapters to volume seven of Newton's Cambridge History of the British Empire (1933) and published Early Constitutional Development in Australia (1934).\nMelbourne's later work concentrated on international relations and Australian relations with Asia. He visited China and Japan on behalf of the University of Queensland in 1931 and 1932. His subsequent publication Report on Australian Intercourse with Japan and China recommended that the Australian government send an official delegation to Asia, which with a similar publication by H. W. Gepp influenced John Latham's Australian Eastern Mission in 1934. Melbourne chaired the federal government's Advisory Committee on Eastern Trade from 1933 to 1935 and was an unsuccessful applicant to become Australia's first trade commissioner to Japan in 1935. He returned to China and Japan in 1936 and published Report on a Visit to the Universities of China and Japan in the same year.\nPersonal life\nIn 1916, Melbourne married Ellen Mary Lowenthal; the couple had no children. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage at a private hospital in Brisbane on 7 January 1943, aged 54. His sudden death was described by the university's chancellor James William Blair as a \"great loss to our educational progress\".\n",
    "2024 video game\nHomeworld: Vast Reaches is a virtual reality real-time strategy game developed by FarBridge and published by Gearbox Software. It was released on the Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3, with plans to release it as a PC VR title later in 2024. It is a part of the Homeworld series of games.\nThe game takes the mechanics used in the other Homeworld titles and adapts them for use in a VR game. The player controls units in \"control groups,\" which allow for easier control in the VR setting. The plot takes place between the games Homeworld and Homeworld 2.\nGameplay\nHomeworld: Vast Reaches is a real-time strategy game set in space. Gameplay, as in most real-time strategy games, is focused on gathering resources, building military forces, and using them to destroy enemy forces and accomplish an objective. The game features only a single-player mode, as opposed to other Homeworld releases, which included multiplayer and skirmish modes. The campaign consists of a six to eight hour story-driven campaign broken up into 11 levels.\nTo adapt the Homeworld series to virtual reality, ships are managed by the player in \"control groups,\" and the player builds units and manages each control group with virtual reality gestures and controls. The central ship of the player's fleet is the mothership, a large base which in previous Homeworld games was where ships were constructed and upgraded. Resources can be spent by the player on building new ships; unlike in previous Homeworld games, ships are no longer constructed inside of the mothership, appearing instead directly inside of control groups. Buildable ships come in a variety of types, which are discovered over the course of the game as the story progresses.\nThe Quest gives the option to play the game in mixed-reality mode \u2013 the Quest's outer cameras will place the game's ships inside of the player's room around them. The Quest 3 uses its color cameras while the Quest 2 only supports a black-and-white mixed-reality mode. Camera controls use a combination of gestures, the player's vision, and the Quest controller triggers to allow the player a wide freedom of movement.\nPlot\nThe game's plot takes place between Homeworld and Homeworld 2, when the Fleet Command Karan S\u2019jet has disconnected from the mothership. Because of this, a new and more aggressive Fleet Command, Tyrra Soban, takes over as Karan teaches her how to manage the fleet. The fleet fends off a new enemy, which IGN's Dan Stapleton described as a faction of \"techno-fetishist bureaucrats  that are easy to hate.\"\nDevelopment\nThe development team built Vast Reaches for VR from the beginning, focusing on the challenges of creating the controls for a VR Homeworld game as one of their top priorities. The release of Vast Reaches was announced on April 23, 2024, on social media, with its Meta Quest release date confirmed for May 2, 2024 and a PC VR release date later in the year.\nReception\nIGN's Dan Stapleton gave Vast Reaches a mixed review, calling it \"an unsatisfying lite\" version of Homeworld. Stapleton noted that although the game captured the series's look and feel well, but that the simplified controls in VR were \"underwhelming\" and that it takes away some of the details that made Homeworld memorable. In a more positive note, Tomas Franzese of Digital Trends pushed back on Stapleton's criticism of the game's easier difficulty, noting that it allowed Vast Reaches to be a good starting place for people new to the series.\n",
    "Aviation museum in Michigan, United States\nThe Michigan Flight Museum, formerly known as the Yankee Air Museum, is an aviation museum located at Willow Run Airport in Van Buren Township, Michigan. The museum has a small fleet of flying aircraft and a collection of static display aircraft outdoors.\nHistory\nYankee Air Force Education Center\nThe Yankee Air Force Inc. was founded in 1981 to pursue these goals:\nTo preserve a part of Michigan's extensive aviation history.\nTo acquire one of the original USAAF hangars and restore it to its original condition.\nTo obtain a B-24 Liberator built at the Ford Willow Run plant, site of the museum.\nThe Yankee Air Force previously operated four divisions in addition to its home base:\nSaginaw Valley at Saginaw County H.W. Browne Airport in Michigan\nWurtsmith Division at Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Michigan\nNortheast Division at Essex County Airport in New Jersey\nFlorida Division in Florida\n2004 fire\nYankee Air Force Museum, Side Entrance\nOn the night of October 9, 2004, the Yankee Air Museum's hangar on the northeast side of Willow Run Airport (KYIP) burned down. The B-17, B-25 and C-47 were saved through heroic efforts by museum volunteers. The Stinson was at another hangar. Everything else inside the hangar was destroyed, including the original prototype North American YOV-10A Bronco, Waco CG-4A Glider, a former Thunderbirds Republic F-105, Aero L-39, Link Trainer, artifacts, spare parts, tools, and the museum's library.\nRebuilding plans were underway within days and the museum's fundraising arm, the Michigan Aerospace Foundation, worked to replace the lost facility with a new, bigger, state-of-the-art aviation museum and aerospace facility. Ground was broken for a new museum building in April 2007. In 2008, the museum changed from a membership club to a director-driven organization with an 11-member board.\nIn 2009, the museum purchased a building from the Michigan Institute of Aviation and Technology (MIAT), on D Street to the east of the airfield, intending it as the new home of the museum collection.\nIn summer 2010, the museum opened the David and Andrea Robertson Education Center in a 1938 schoolhouse that had been moved from another part of the Willow Run complex. This had been the officers' club for the USAAF detachments stationed at Willow Run during the war, and was apparently the schoolhouse for the boys living at Henry Ford's Willow Run Farm (a social experiment that used the Willow Run site in 1939 and 1940 before the airfield and industrial complex were ever conceived).\nThe museum reopened to the public on October 10, 2010, six years to the day after the fire. This allowed the museum to vacate Hangar Two, which was condemned by the Wayne County Airport Authority.\nThe museum became a Smithsonian Affiliate in July 2011.\nMove to Willow Run bomber plant\nFormer logo\nIn April 2013, Yankee Air Museum and RACER Trust, owner of the former General Motors Willow Run plant, announced a plan for Yankee Air Museum to acquire a 175,000-square-foot (16,300\u00a0m2) portion of the factory, contingent upon the museum raising the funds necessary to preserve and secure their proposed portion of the facility. The museum would consolidate operations scattered on various parcels at Willow Run Airport into the 1941 landmark, designed by Albert Kahn, with the trust seeking to clear the remainder of the plant for redevelopment. The plant was used during World War II to manufacture B-24 bombers.\nThe campaign to save a portion of Willow Run for the Yankee Air Museum is called SaveTheBomberPlant.org, and is centered on a fundraising website by the same name.\nAfter extending the fundraising deadline to Oct. 1, and then to Nov. 1, 2013, on October 26, 2013, RACER Trust and the Yankee Air Museum again reached a new, and final, deadline extension agreement. The final deadline to raise the funds necessary to preserve a portion of the Willow Run plant for the Yankee Air Museum was May 1, 2014.\nAt the time of the May 1, 2014 deadline, the Yankee Air Museum had raised over $7 million of its original $8 million fundraising goal, which was enough to enable the trust to move forward and sign a purchase agreement with Yankee, with the actual purchase expected to be finalized in late summer or fall of 2014. The majority of the $8 million fundraising goal reflects separation costs to make the preserved portion of the plant viable as a standalone structure.\nThe remaining portion of the Willow Run complex, which includes over 95% of the historic building, has been sold to Walbridge, Inc., for redevelopment as a connected vehicle research and test facility. RACER Trust will demolish this portion of the building prior to turning the property over to Walbridge. Preparations for demolition of Willow Run Assembly facility, with the exception of the portion that the Yankee Air Museum is campaigning to save, were well underway as of August 2014, with much of the building already demolished.\nIn October 2014 the museum",

The race was held on Saturday, May 11, 2024, in Darlington, South Carolina at Darlington Raceway, a 1.366 miles (2.198\u00a0km) permanent asphalt egg-shaped speedway. The race took the scheduled 147 laps to complete. Justin Allgaier, driving for JR Motorsports, would put on a blistering performance, winning both stages and leading a race-high 119 laps to earn his 24th career NASCAR Xfinity Series win, and his first of the season. With his win, he ties with Dale Earnhardt Jr. for the 10th most wins in Xfinity Series history. To fill out the podium, Austin Hill, driving for Richard Childress Racing, and Cole Custer, driving for Stewart\u2013Haas Racing, would finish 2nd and 3rd, respectively.\nReport\nBackground\nDarlington Raceway, the circuit where the race was held.\nDarlington Raceway is a race track built for NASCAR racing located near Darlington, South Carolina. It is nicknamed \"The Lady in Black\" and \"The Track Too Tough to Tame\" by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as \"A NASCAR Tradition.\" It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that is effective at both ends.\nSince 2015, the race has hosted NASCAR's Throwback weekend, which features cars sporting paint schemes that pay homage to past teams and drivers.

It is also known as the \u2018\u2019palace of 365 doors\u2019\u2019 (French: Palais de 365 portes or French: Palais de trois cent soixante-cinq portes). Although, it has not 365 doors. The palace was built for the first and last king of Haiti, Henri Christophe I. It overlooks the city center and the Artibonite River. Today, the palace ruins are in poor condition and deteriorating.\nOne kilometre east of the palace is the Cr\u00eate-\u00e0-Pierrot fortress, where there was a major battle of the Haitian Revolution in March 1802.\nHistory\nThe Palais de la Belle Rivi\u00e8re was built in 1820 by Louis Dupeyrac to serve as a royal residence for king Henri Christophe, next to his residence in Milot, the Sans-Souci Palace. It was still under construction, when the Kingdom of Haiti fell in 1820 due to revolution and the king suffering a stroke. Shortly afterwards, he committed suicide\u2014according to legend, by shooting himself with a silver bullet. Therefore, the palace was never completed, and the intended second floor was not realized.\nHenri Christophe I constructed the palace to consolidate his power in the vast and rich agricultural Artibonite region, which bordered to the republic of South Haiti, which was ruled by General Alexandre P\u00e9tion. Henri was known for his construction works: He built six ch\u00e2teaux, eight palaces and the massive Citadel Henri, now known as Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re, on a mountain near Milot. The Sans-Souce palace was his most famous palace. Although in ruins today, this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe Palace has a rectangular plan, 68 metres long and 11 metres wide. Its west facade is backed by a vast rotunda, 12 meters in diameter. The walls of the palace are made of stone masonry and clay bricks bonded with lime mortar.\nThe first restoration work was undertaken in 1932, when the first campaign to safeguard Haiti's monuments started. Although, the restoration did probably not meet the rules of restoration, it slowed down the deterioration of the ruins and protected them against bad weather. In the second half of the 20th century, the building housed a municipal primary school and lodged various offices of the State and the Municipality. The palace also housed the local office of the National Security Volunteers (VSN), the Tonton Macoute, which was disbanded in 1986.\nIn 1995, the president of Haiti declared the palace national heritage and placed it in hands of the local municipality. Another restoration followed after the 2010 earthquake, the palace was restored from its dilapidated state. However today, the palace is still in poor condition and deteriorating again.\n",
    "\nMilitary unit\nThe 10th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (Stockbrokers) (10th RF) was an infantry unit of 'Kitchener's Army' in World War I. Recruited from the financial community of the City of London it was the original 'Pals battalion'. It served on the Western Front from July 1915 until the Armistice, seeing action at the Somme and the Ancre, at Arras and Ypres, against the German spring offensive, and in the final Hundred Days Offensive.\nRecruitment\nAlfred Leete's recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. Men flooded into the recruiting offices and the 'first hundred thousand' were enlisted within days. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.\nMeanwhile, on 19 August the Director of Recruiting at the War Office (WO), Major-General Sir Henry Rawlinson, wrote to his friend Major the Hon Robert 'Bobby' White, who worked at the stockbrokers Govett & Sons in the City of London. He told White that Kitchener was anxious to get additional recruits for the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment). He suggested that they could recruit from men working for the financial businesses in the city: 'many City employ\u00e9s ... would be willing to enlist if they were assured that they would serve with their friends'. White set up a recruiting office at Govett's premises in Throgmorton Street and enlisted over 1600 men in under a week. Parading before Field Marshal Earl Roberts at Temple Gardens on 29 August in all sorts of clothing, from silk hats and morning coats to caps and Norfolk jackets, they marched to the Tower of London to be sworn in by the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Vansittart Bowater, who later became the battalion's Honorary Colonel. Impressed by the response to the battalion, the Earl of Derby coined the phrase 'a battalion of pals', and began recruiting similar groups in Liverpool. Soon Pals battalions were springing up all over the country. The Royal Fusiliers sponsored several  of these \u2013 the Empire Battalion, the Public Schools Battalions, the Sportsmen, the Frontiersmen etc, but the 'Stockbrokers' was the first, handed over to the WO as part of  'Kitchener's Second New Army' (K2) on 6 September 1914.\nTraining\nOn 3 September the men paraded at the Tower and entrained for Colchester in Essex, where they were accommodated at Sobraon Barracks. Lieutenant-Colonel Claude Hawker, formerly of the Coldstream Guards and just returned from service with the Anatolian Gendarmerie in the Turkish Empire, was appointed commanding officer (CO) with White as second-in-command. White had been able to obtain 25 ex-non-commissioned officers (NCOs) from the Brigade of Guards to assist with the training, which proceeded rapidly, although there were not enough rifles to equip the whole battalion. Hawker left in December and White was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 6 December to command the battalion. As a 'spare' Kitchener battalion outside the main army organisation, the 10th Royal Fusiliers was designated as 'Army Troops', ie not assigned to a specific formation. White lobbied to get the battalion attached to the First New Army (K1), which would be going overseas first. However, it was attached to the 18th (Eastern) Division which was gathering round Colchester as part of K2. 10th Royal Fusiliers remained attached to this division until 25 February 1915, when it moved to Andover, Hampshire, to join 44th (later 37th) Division. (The battalion's depot companies seem to have remained at Colchester.)\nAs authorised in March 1915, 37th Division consisted of Kitchener battalions that had originally been allocated as Army Troops to the New Armies. 10th Royal Fusiliers was allotted to 111th Brigade in the new division; the brigade also included 13th RF, 13th King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), and 13th Rifle Brigade (RB). By April 1915 when the division was formed, all its units had been training for some months, and it was quickly assembled on Salisbury Plain for final battle training. 10th Royal Fusiliers was stationed at Windmill Hill near Ludgershall from 7 April to 30 July. In July orders arrived for the division to move to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. Embarkation began on 28 July, the 10th RF advance party arrived in France on 30 July and most of the remainder of the battalion next day. On 2 August the division completed its concentration around Tilques, near Saint-Omer.\n10th Battalion, Intelligence (B)\nBefore World War I the Directorate of Military Intelligence at the War Office had identified a number of officers and civilians whose skills could be used in the event of war, and th",
    "3rd- and 4th-generation Bablyonian Amora\nRav Hiyya bar Ami was a third- and fourth-generation Babylonian Amora.\nBiography\nHis main teacher was Ulla, but he also learned from Rav Chisda and \u1e24ulfana Seder HaDoroth questions whether his father was a Kohen or not.\nOne of his colleagues was Rav Yosef bar Hiyya. The Talmud cites a dispute between Rav Hiyya and Rav Yosef regarding the precise measure of a double sit that determines liability for one who whitens on Shabbat.\nIn several places the Talmud relates that Rav Nachman, Ulla and Avimi bar Pappi were sitting and discussing halakha amongst themselves while Hiyya bar Ami was sitting before them like a student before his teachers. Sometimes he would sit and discuss among them and give answers to their questions.\nThe Talmud says that Rav Hiyya bar Ami's slave once immersed a gentile woman in a mikveh so he could have relations with her (to purify her from her niddah status). The slave then married the woman and had a daughter with her. The Talmud discusses the status of the woman and her daughter, whether immersion for the sake of niddah is also effective for conversion to Judaism.\nSayings\nMost of Rav Hiyya bar Ami's statements are said in the name of Ulla and are in the realm of halacha. The following Aggadic statements of Rav Hiyya bar Ami in the name of Ulla all appear in Berakhot .\nRabbi Hiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: From the day the Temple was destroyed, the Holy One, blessed is He, has only four cubits of halacha.\nOne who benefits from the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears Heaven. For regarding fear of Heaven, the verse states, \"Fortunate is the man who fears God,\" whereas regarding one who benefits from the toil of his hands, the verse states, \"When you eat the fruit of your labor you are fortunate and it is good for you.\" \"Fortunate\" means in this world. \"Good for you\" in the world to come. With regard to fear of Heaven it does not say \"It will be good for you.\"\nA person should always live in the place of his teacher, for as long as Shimei ben Gera was alive, Solomon did not marry Pharaoh's daughter.\n",
    "Not to be confused with the 1879 battle and 1933 in Colombia.\nThe Recapture of Tarapac\u00e1 or Siege of Tarapac\u00e1 was a confrontation between Bolivian occupation forces under the command of Colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda and Peruvian militias under the command of Major Juan Buend\u00eda within the framework of the War between Peru and Bolivia between January 6 and 7, 1842. Peruvian victory allowed us to recover the province of Tarapac\u00e1, which had been captured by Bolivian troops days before.\nBackground\nIn 1841, the president of Peru, Agust\u00edn Gamarra, attempted to annex Bolivia (colonial Upper Peru), an undertaking that cost him his life by Peruvian Army on November 18 of that same year in the Battle of Ingavi. The Bolivian army under the command of General Jos\u00e9 Ballivi\u00e1n invades Peru, occupying Moquegua and Puno and immediately sending Col. Rodr\u00edguez Magari\u00f1os, chief of the second Bolivian division to occupy Tacna and Arica, which said Bolivian chief carried out in December 1841. On January 2 of the following year, a column of one hundred Bolivian soldiers, under the command of Colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda and his second, Commander Juan Montero, 3 occupies the town of Tarapac\u00e1, converting the Cabildo house into barracks for his troops, the Peruvian sub-prefect Calixto Guti\u00e9rrez de La Fuente retires to Iquique carrying the news of the occupation of the Bolivian troops. In said city he contacted Major Juan Buend\u00eda y Noriega who organized a column of militiamen with the residents of the port of Iquique and emigrants from Tacna, thus setting off for Tarapac\u00e1 on January 5, 1842.\nBattle\nOnce the forces were recomposed, Major Juan Buend\u00eda left Iquique with a column of volunteers towards Tarapac\u00e1 , fighting on the night of January 6 with the help of residents of the provincial capital, a fight that lasted until seven in the morning on next day. However, what actually happened is that Buend\u00eda, before starting a fight, settled in the La Pe\u00f1a nitrate office, following to the letter the strategy designed by the subprefect, apparently days before the invasion. In this nitrate mine he not only gathered men and weapons, but on January 4 and 5 he dispatched armed groups to harass the occupation forces day and night. This procedure aimed at weakening the invading forces was so successful that the Bolivian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda asked his superiors to send infantry and cavalry troops in order to confront them:\n\"Se hallan mucho dispersos y los va reuniendo el comandante Juan D. Buend\u00eda a distancia de catorce leguas llamada La Pe\u00f1a, y este se\u00f1or van dos noches que me tiene abrumado con sus tiros, con los doce de caballer\u00eda que tiene, y como est\u00e1n bien montados no les puedo hacer nada, y si tuviese ya la mitad de la caballer\u00eda, podr\u00eda tomarlos como tambi\u00e9n toda la caballada; pues con los que tengo no puedo perseguirlos una sola cuadra porque en su vida han manejado el arma, y quiz\u00e1s los m\u00e1s de ellos no la han conocido. Esto es que me hallo con hombres armados y en inacci\u00f3n\".\nAtte. Cnel. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda. (El Comercio, 22/01/1842, page 4)\".\nThus, the date and time chosen to repel the invaders was due to intelligently articulated planning a Bolivian troop without sleep for two nights in a row, also without rest and poorly fed for the same period. The account of the combat by Juan Buend\u00eda himself was issued in the following terms:\nA mi aproximaci\u00f3n a Tarapac\u00e1, se me reuni\u00f3 bastante gente aunque con pocas armas. Ello es que el 6 a las 11 de la noche estuve frente al enemigo que ocupaba una posici\u00f3n casi inexpugnable; favorecido de la cual me rompi\u00f3 un vivo fuego que fue contestado por los nuestros con no menor ardor por lo que al poco rato me encontr\u00e9 sin municiones, mas el entusiasmo del pueblo remedi\u00f3 esta falta, pues mientras nos bat\u00edamos, ellos constru\u00edan cartuchos con los que me sostuve hasta las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana del 7, habiendo habido toda la noche un fuego sin interrupci\u00f3n. Los paisanos que ten\u00eda sin armas hice fuesen a tirar piedras con hondas y galgas al enemigo desde un cerro que domina la casa que ocupaban; y se llenaron tanto de terror que a la hora dicha se me rindieron a discreci\u00f3n quedando muerto el coronel Garc\u00eda jefe de la fuerza invasora; mal herido el mayor Coloma hermano de mi compadre, y 9 individuos de tropa. Nuestra p\u00e9rdida consiste en la muerte de un soldado y 5 heridos\n(El Comercio, 01/22/1842, page 3).\nConsequences\nAt six in the morning, Colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda was mortally wounded, ordering Commander Montero to fight until the last cartridge. An hour later, the Bolivian garrison, without ammunition and heavily decimated, surrendered at his discretion and had to proceed to return the town of Tarapac\u00e1 to its joyful inhabitants. and brave inhabitants.\nAs an interesting fact, it should be added that the brave Tarapacan priest who managed to obtain the lead for the shots of the heroes of the local resistance, was still alive at the time when Ricardo Palma immortalized the entertaining story in his famous book on the Tradici",

    "\n1976 Dir revolt refers to a rebellion by Kohistani tribesmen against the government of Pakistan from 3 September to 10 September 1976. The rebellion was suppressed and stabilised government control over the area.\nBackground\nDir was a Princely state under the British suzerainty and after the Partition of India, it became part of Pakistan. It's autonomy was reduced in 1955 and after a coup by Pakistani special forces in 1960, the area came under de facto Pakistani control. In 1969, the state of dir was officially abolished and it was fully incorporated into Pakistan. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto started a land reform project in which large sections of timber forest was confiscated. It was a vital source of income for the locals and they stated protesting against the reform.\nRebellion\nThe rebellion initially started as a protest by the local tribesmen in the Shongan valley south of Dir. In an effort to disperse the protesters, Dir Levies started firing tear gas shells on the protesters. Upon hearing the sound of shelling, multiple tribesmen including Suktankhel and Paidankhel tribesmen carrying melee weapons from the surrounding areas also entered the battlefield and started attacking the troops of Dir Levies. The situation soon went out of the control of Dir Levies. The tribesmen had blockaded the main road to Dir city and they had put the town under siege. They looted multiple military weapons storehouses, destroyed a government hospital, and lowered Pakistani flags replacing them with the flags of Dir. The Pakistani government decided to deploy the Pakistan army and Pakistan Air Force to quell the rebellion. 10,000 troops of Pakistan army entered the area. They faced heavy resistance from the 2000 tribesmen. A team of Pakistani military engineers was ambushed by the tribesmen. Infantry alone failed to quell the rebellion, and so tanks and artillery were used extensively. Sniper positions were established on multiple mountains. Similarly Pakistani Air Force's Sabres also launched multiple air strikes on the tribesmen. Pakistani casualties were about 120 while the casualties for the tribesmen numbered at around 180. The military succeeded in suppressing the rebellion on 10 September.\nAftermath\nZulfiqar Ali Bhutto visited the area after the rebellion. He expressed sorrow at the loss of life and blamed it on the irresponsible behaviour of Dir Levies. The land reforms went through without further problem.\n",
    "Polish jurist\nTomasz Szmydt, 2024, Belarusian propaganda channel BelTA\nTomasz Szmydt (Polish pronunciation: ; born 27 April 1970 in Bia\u0142ystok, eastern Poland) is a former Polish jurist, employed as a judge in the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw. He adjudicated in the law court's second department on access to classified information in regard of members of the Polish military and intelligence.\nOn 1 May 2024, via Turkey, he defected to Belarus, where he applied for political asylum to 'temporarily rest  in an open and friendly country.' The judge most likely was extracted from Poland by the Belarusian security forces. Szmydt would have rather defected to Russia, but due to the short-visit visa waiver for Polish citizens to enter Belarus, he chose the latter country to avoid raising the Polish Foreign Intelligence Agency's suspicions. On 6 May 2024, the Belarusian state-owned governmental news agency BelTA held a press conference in Minsk, during which Szmydt praised the Belarusian authorities, proposing that Belarus is \u2018a country with great potential,\u2019 headed by \u2018a very wise leader.\u2019 Alexander Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, reciprocated; dubbing the fugitive judge 'a brave man' Szmydt later explained that he fled to Belarus in order to 'protest to the Polish authorities who under the influence of the US and the UK are leading the country to war.'\nAt this conference, Szmydt presented his signed letter of resignation from the post of a judge in the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw. The Regional Court announced that they were unaware of this letter, while Szmydt was on his annual leave through 10 May 2024. On 7 May 2024, the Regional Court initiated disciplinary proceedings regarding the judge's case. In reply to the request lodged by National Public Prosecutor's Office (Prokuratura Krajowa), on 9 May 2024, the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland waived the judge's immunity. Furthermore, the Supreme Administrative Court also accepted the judge's public resignation. As a result Szmydt ceased being a judge.\nReactions\nThe unprecedented situation is assessed in Poland by the authorities and mass media as treason. Szmydt is lambasted as a 'traitor.' The Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Rados\u0142aw Sikorski and Poland\u2019s National Security Bureau (BBN) chief pl:Jacek Siewiera consent, the strong suspicion being that this defection is already used for the sake of Russia's hybrid warfare against the West. This suspicion rests on Szmydt's appeal to Polish politicians that they should \u2018resume dialog with  President Lukashenko and Russia.\u2019 The Kremlin's leading propagandist Vladimir Solovyov also invited Szmydt to his primetime program, in which the judge participated twice. Apart from facing potential criminal charges, recently Szmydt was deciding on state functionaries' access to top secret NATO and EU documents. Now Szmydt hopes to meet President Lukashenko in person and work as a politician or geopolitical analyst in Belarus. Meanwhile, it transpired that the judge had sojourned in Belarus in June 2023 evoking no reaction on the part of the Polish counterintelligence. Even more worryingly, between 2019 and 2023, Szmydt sojourned in Ukraine 'tens of times' with no official oversight or explanation.\nAfter the initial shock, the reactions in Poland resulted in further polarization of the political scene. Accusations are traded between the current pro-democratic government and the formerly ruling Law and Justice party (now in opposition) on who is responsible for Szmydt's recruitment to provide intelligence to Russia and Belarus. It is one of effects that the Russian propaganda seeks to achieve in a targeted democratic country, namely, 'exacerbating polarisation,' with an eye to 'to undermine democracy.'\nRussian and Belarusian propaganda coverage\nAs reported by the propaganda-led Russian and Belarusian mass media, on 7 May 2024, Szmydt changed the presumable cause of his defection, citing the danger of 'physical liquidation' in Poland. A day later, he added that upon return to Poland he would be incarcerated on trumped up changes, or would be assassinated in a staged motoring accident or suicide. Hence, Szmydt also asked for the Belarusian president's protection, which should also be extended over his relatives, who remain in Poland. Furthermore, Szmydt requested the Belarusian authorities to deliver to the Polish Ambassy in Minsk his letter of resignation from the law court in Warsaw. In line with the Russian propaganda's typical modus operandi, the presumed causes of Szmydt's defection are multiplied. Among others, it is proposed, the judge was persecuted for 'telling the truth to power,'  that an official probe into his spying for Belarus was imminent, which could result in incarceration, that he maintained 'our Slavic peoples can live in harmony', that he 'refused to hate the Russians,' or that he was compelled to adjudicate in 'breach of his civic conscience.'\nAfter discussing the 'causes' of his",

    "Russian communist revolutionary (1892\u20131919)\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is  Mikhailovna and the family name is  Serdyukova.\nKsenia Mikhailovna Ge (n\u00e9e\u00a0Serdyukova; Russian: \u041a\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u0435; 1892\u20131919) was a Russian communist revolutionary. Born in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, she joined the Bolshevik Party while in exile, where she met her husband Aleksandr Ge. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, she moved to the Caucasian city of Kislovodsk, where she worked for the Cheka and the People's Commissariat of Health. After the Volunteer Army captured the city, she was arrested and her husband was killed. She attempted to escape, but was given up and hanged.\nBiography\nKsenia Mikhailovna Serdyukova was born in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, in 1892, the daughter of a military officer. She was educated in Vilnius, after which she went into exile and frequented Russian revolutionary circles, meeting her husband Aleksandr Ge and joining the Bolshevik Party. Following the February Revolution, Ksenia and her husband returned to Russia, settling in Moscow, where they worked for the party. After the October Revolution, Ge moved to Kislovodsk, where she worked as a senior investigator for the Cheka, and as head of the People's Commissariat of Health.\nDuring the White offensive in the Northern Caucasus, Ksenia participated in the defense of Kislovodsk, but facing an overwhelming White force, the Red Army soon fled the city. Ge decided to remain behind, in order to care for her sick daughter, who would have been unable to leave with them. She also persuaded her husband, Aleksandr Ge, to stay with them. On 20 January\u00a0\u00a01919, Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army captured Kislovodsk and brought the city under the White Terror. On 21 January, Ge's husband was killed by the Whites while covering the retreat of Chekists fleeing the city. The following day, Ksenia herself was arrested. She was detained in a hotel room, together with her daughter.\nDeath\nOn 23 January, she was sentenced to be hanged by a military tribunal. She managed to escape that same night, disguised in a burka and a papakha, and fled to Yessentuki on foot, leaving behind her sleeping daughter and a letter addressed to her mother and late husband. She took refuge with a local doctor, but he gave her up to the Whites, in return for a bounty of 50,000 rubles. Ge was taken back to Kislovodsk, where, on 24 January 1919, she was hanged on Cossack Hill. Her daughter continued to face torture by the Whites; a hotel manager attempted to rescue her, but she died soon after.\nMemorial\nIn 1957, a monument to Ksenia Ge, sculpted by Khamzat Krymshamkhalov\u00a0, was erected in Kislovodsk.

A forest complex adjoins it from the northwest, while on the eastern shore, there is a complex of holiday homes. To the south lies the village of Bor\u00f3wno, from which the lake takes its name. In the forest adjacent to the north, there is the Augustowo nature reserve, protecting a peatland, alder carr, and a habitat of swamp willow. Two similar lakes, Kusowo and Dobrcz, connect to the north of the lake.\nThe lake basin has a regular shape sloping towards the center, with one central depression measuring 14 m in depth. The lake bed surface below the 12.5-meter isobath constitutes 21% of the total lake area. Small and shallow bays have formed at both ends of the lake. The total length of the shoreline is 3.96\u00a0km.\nThe littoral zone of the lake occupies 38% of the entire reservoir area. The marginal bays are entirely covered with stonewort meadows. Common stonewort dominates, accompanied to a lesser extent by species such as Eurasian watermilfoil, lesser bulrush, and Charetum fragilis.\nDrainage basin\nThe lake is fed by small, intermittent watercourses and essentially constitutes a closed basin, strongly reacting (along with the neighboring reservoirs of Kusowo and Dobrcz) to changes in rainfall conditions. Therefore, in 1978, an artificial drainage system was built for the lake, which, through a pumping station, can divert excess water to the Augustowski stream. However, due to the usually low water levels in the lake, this system is rarely utilized.\nThe direct drainage basin of the lake coincides with the total drainage basin, covering an area of 19.43\u00a0km2. Its area encompasses the bifurcation part of the post-glacial tunnel valley, running northeast to southwest. Its western part is drained by the Augustowski stream, which flows into the Kotomierzyca river, a left-bank tributary of the Brda river, while in its northeastern fragment, the Niewie\u015bci\u0144ski stream, which flows into the Vistula river, begins its course. The land use structure of the drainage basin is as follows:\nagricultural land: 71% of the total drainage basin;\nforests: 19%;\nother 10% (mostly marshes and floodplains near lakes Kusowo and Dobrcz).\nThe total drainage basin of the lake includes two water reservoirs: Kusowo Lake (48 ha), Dobrcz Lake (24 ha), and an accompanying floodplain covering an area of 24 ha.\nThe waters of Bor\u00f3wno Lake have limited hydraulic contact with groundwater, resulting in groundwater recharge contributing only a small percentage to the overall water balance of the reservoir.\nThe direct drainage basin of the lake is characterized by numerous recreational buildings in the form of a complex of 350 allotment gardens, which constitute a significant source of anthropogenic pressure.\nWater quality\nBor\u00f3wno Lake is characterized by average, second-degree susceptibility of waters to degradation. Unfavorable features of the lake's drainage basin include land use dominated by agriculture and a low elongation index value, indicating weak dilution capacity of pollutants from outside sources.\nWater stratification amounts to 11.3%, suggesting favorable conditions for the development of high primary production. This facilitates the entry of nutrients into the eutrophic zone of the lake. This is also favored by the existence of prolonged anaerobic conditions.\nWater quality studies of the lake have been conducted since 1984. In 1986 and 1992, the water was classified as Class II purity, although subsequent studies showed a gradual deterioration in water quality. A study from 2002 recorded Class III water purity. Against this background, the trophic indicators of the lake were favorable, such as water transparency (about 2.5 m, and over 3 m in summer) and chlorophyll content. Cesspits located in allotment gardens on the eastern shore of the lake have a negative impact on the water quality of Bor\u00f3wno Lake. A study conducted in 2009 by the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Bydgoszcz showed good water quality in the reservoir.\nTrophically, the lake belongs to the transitional meso-eutrophic type.\nFishing\nThe Polish Fishing Association is the lessee of Bor\u00f3wno Lake. The fishing management is conducted in a manner characteristic of tourist-utilized lakes. Only controlled catches are carried out on this body of water, targeting common bream, common roach, and European perch.\nRecreation\nBor\u00f3wno Lake is one of the two closest recreational areas to the city of Bydgoszcz, thus serving important recreational functions for its residents. It is estimated that during the summer season, on weekends, around 5,000 to 6,000 people relax by its shores. Access from the city side is convenient via the national road 5 Bydgoszcz-Gda\u0144sk. It is the nearest recreational lake for the residents of",
    "Indonesian state-owned company in the guarantee industry\nPT Jaminan Kredit Indonesia (Jamkrindo) is a part of one of Indonesia's state-owned enterprises and is a component of PT Bahana Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia (Indonesia Financial Group), operating in the field of credit guarantee, both conventional and sharia. It is the only state-owned enterprise tasked with providing guarantees.\nHistory\nIn 1970, the Indonesian government established the Cooperative Credit Guarantee Institution (LJKK) at a time when cooperatives were still lagging behind state-owned and private enterprises. At that time, LJKK provided limited guarantee services, namely for the TRI Program credit guarantee, Padi Palawija credit, and Fertilizer Procurement credit.\nIn its development, LJKK transformed into the Public Company for Cooperative Financial Development (Perum PKK) to expand its service coverage. It no longer focused solely on cooperatives but extended its services to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). This change was established through Government Regulation No. 51 of 1981, which was later refined by Government Regulation No. 27 of 1985.\nIn 2000, Perum PKK underwent another transformation into Perum SPU (Business Development Facility) through Government Regulation No. 95 of 2000. This transformation aimed to realize guarantee activities covering bank or non-bank credits, guarantees for leasing financing, factoring, consumer financing, profit-sharing financing, installment purchases, service contract transactions, profit-sharing guarantee issuance, management and consulting assistance, surety bond issuance, and other guarantee activities.\nJamkrindo Building in Jakarta, Indonesia\nIn 2008, with the issuance of Government Regulation No. 41 of 2008, Perum SPU changed its name to Perum Jaminan Kredit Indonesia (Perum Jamkrindo). This change was made because it no longer provided direct guarantees to MSMEs through profit-sharing schemes but focused on MSME credit guarantee businesses. Subsequently, in the same year, the government issued Presidential Regulation No. 2 of 2008 regarding Guarantee Institutions and Minister of Finance Regulation No. 222/PMK.010/2008 regarding Credit Guarantee Companies and Credit Re-Guarantee Companies, which positioned Perum Jamkrindo as a company required to obtain a business license as a credit guarantee company. Then, through Minister of Finance Decision No. KEP-77/KM.10/2009, Perum Jamkrindo's business license as a credit guarantee company was determined.\nIn 2020, President Joko Widodo changed the legal entity of Perum Jamkrindo to a limited liability company. This change was established through Government Regulation No. 11 of 2020 concerning the Change of Legal Entity Form of the Public Company (Perum) Jaminan Kredit Indonesia into a Limited Liability Company (Persero). This transformation was made to meet the requirements for entry into the insurance and guarantee holding company and as a business consideration to enable strategic decisions to be made more quickly compared to when it was still in the form of a Public Company.\nIn April 2020, Minister of State-Owned Enterprises Erick Thohir appointed PT Bahana Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia (Bahana) as the parent company (holding) for state-owned insurance and guarantee companies. The establishment of this holding company was enacted through Government Regulation No. 20 of 2020 concerning the Addition of State Capital Participation of the Republic of Indonesia into the Equity of the Limited Liability Company (Persero) PT Bahana Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia, signed by President Joko Widodo on March 16, 2020. Under this legal framework, PT Jamkrindo officially came under the umbrella of Bahana.\n",
    "\nFor an international list of protests, see List of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in 2024.\nUniversities in the United States with Israel\u2013Hamas war protests in April 2024. Columbia University is marked in red. Other colleges that had encampments are marked in green, and non-encampment protests are marked in blue.\nThis is a list of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in the United States in 2024 since protests escalated on April 17, beginning with the Columbia University campus occupation. Student protests have occurred in 45 out of 50 states and the District of Columbia, with encampments, occupations, walkouts or sit-ins occurring on almost 140 U.S. campuses as of May 6.  Protests have also taken place in more than 25 countries.\nDemonstrations initially spread in the United States on April 22, when students at several universities on the East Coast\u2014including New York University, Yale University, Emerson College, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Tufts University\u2014began occupying campuses, as well as experiencing mass arrests in New York and at Yale. Protests emerged throughout the U.S. in the following days, with protest camps established on over 40 campuses. On April 25, mass arrests occurred at Emerson College, the University of Southern California, and the University of Texas at Austin.\nA continued crackdown on April 27 led to approximately 275 arrests at Washington, Northeastern, Arizona State, and Indiana University Bloomington. Several professors were among those detained at Emory University, and at Washington University in St. Louis, university employees were arrested. On April 28, counter-protests were held at MIT, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). On April 30, approximately 300 protesters were arrested at Columbia University and City College of New York; and pro-Israel counter-protesters attacked the UCLA campus occupation, The following day over 200 arrests were made at UCLA. Hundreds of arrests ensued in May, notably at Art Institute of Chicago, University of California, San Diego and the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.\nBackground\nClockwise from top: \nColumbia University\nHarvard University\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nGeorge Washington University\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\nUniversity of Texas, Austin\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses.\nPro-Palestinian protests on university campuses escalated in April 2024, spreading in the United States and other countries, as part of wider Israel\u2013Hamas war protests. The escalation began after mass arrests at the Columbia University campus occupation, led by anti-Zionist groups, in which protesters demanded the university's disinvestment from Israel over its alleged genocide of Palestinians. On May 7, protests spread across Europe with mass arrests in the Netherlands. As of May 12, 20 encampments have also been established in the United Kingdom, and across universities in Australia and Canada. Some protesters have referred to the movement as the \"student intifada\".\nThe different protests' varying demands include severing financial ties with Israel, transparency over financial ties, an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions, and amnesty for protesters. Universities have suspended and expelled student protesters, in some cases evicting them from campus housing and restricting their access to campus resources. Some universities have relied on campus and local police to forcibly disband encampments and end occupations of university buildings. Police repression of student protests, particularly in the United States, has been characterized as unusually harsh. In the U.S. over 2,950 protesters have been arrested, including faculty members and professors, on over 60 campuses. Other universities made agreements with protesters in order for encampments to be dismantled. Some universities' graduation ceremonies were canceled, and further protests occurred at various graduation ceremonies in May 2024. The occupations have resulted in the closure of Columbia University, Cal Poly Humboldt, and the University of Amsterdam; Portland State University pausing financial ties with Boeing over its ties to Israel; and Trinity College Dublin agreeing to end certain investments in Israeli companies.\nOver 200 groups have expressed support for the protests, as well as Senator Bernie Sanders, members of Congress and several labor unions. The police response to the protests has also been criticized by various Democrats and human rights organizations. The protests have been compared to the 1960s anti-Vietnam protests and the 1968 protests. According to Axios, 8% of college students have participated in the protests.\nSupporters of Israel and some Jewish students have raised concerns about antisemitic incidents at or around the protests, prompting condemnations from leaders including President Joe Biden, ",
    "Greek mythological figure\nFor other uses, see Arethusa (Greek myth).\n1st-century BC statue connected to the cult of Euripius Poseidon, Chalcis.\nIn Greek mythology, Arethusa (/\u02cc\u00e6r\u026a\u02c8\u03b8ju\u02d0z\u0259/; Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03c1\u03ad\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1, romanized:\u00a0Ar\u00e9thousa) is a minor figure who became a lover of the sea-god Poseidon, before undergoing a transformation at the hands of Hera during a lost episode of Greek myth. She then became the spring of the same name in Chalcis.\nThe New Archaeological Museum of Chalcis was named 'Arethusa' after this legendary woman.\nMythology\nArethusa's story is mostly known from a fragment of the Michigan papyrus (Papyrus Michigan, inv. no. 1447). The fragmentary Hellenistic text attributes the story to Hesiod, though it has been identified as part of the pseudo-Hesiodic Catalogue of Women, an epic poem written around the seventh or sixth century BC. The fragment, as restored by Reinhold Merkelbach and Martin Litchfield West, reads:\n\u1f08\u03c1\u03ad\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03b8\u03c5\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f59\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03c5, \u03a0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b5\u03bb\u03b8\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u0392\u03bf\u03ca\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u0395\u1f54\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd  \u1f20\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03b7 \u1f10\u03bd \u03a7 \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78  \u1f2d\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f29\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\nAccording to the damaged text, Arethusa was the daughter of Hyperes, though it does not clarify whether this is Hyperes of Troezen or Hyperes of Boeotia. It further says that this Arethusa slept by the shore of the Euripus Strait (in Euboea) with a man whose name is not preserved, but which starts with 'P' and contains the diphthong 'ei'; it is generally accepted that this is meant to read 'Poseidon' (as Merkelbach and West restored). The theory is supported by the works of Hyginus and Stephanus of Byzantium, who wrote that Poseidon and Arethusa became the parents of the hero Abas, as well as Hesychius of Alexandria, who wrote that one of Poseidon's epithets was Euripios. Euboea was often called Abantis after Abas.\nFollowing her tryst with Poseidon, Arethusa was then transformed by the goddess Hera at a place starting with chi (Chalcis), the principal city of Euboea. The fragment however makes no mention of what Hera transformed Arethusa into, or why. The presence of a spring called Arethusa in Chalcis leads to the deduction that Arethusa was changed into this spring, like other women in Greek mythology bearing the same name were.\nHera's motivations are harder to decipher. There are two possibilities behind her motive; either Hera did so in order to punish Arethusa over an unknown offence, or perhaps it was an act of mercy. Given that Arethusa's lover was Poseidon, and not Hera's husband Zeus, marital infidelity can be ruled out as the reason. It is possible that Arethusa made a hubristic remark against Hera or dared to compare herself to the queen of the gods. Alternatively, if Hera's motivation was sympathy and mercy, perhaps she did so to save Arethusa from some hardship or threat she was facing, like Athena did with Corone.\nArethusa's son Abas named his daughter Arethusa after his mother.\nCulture\nThe myth of Arethusa is an aetiological one, as its primary role is to explain the presence of the Arethusa spring in Chalcis. According to ancient authors, the clear waters of the spring were favoured by eels in particular, which were considered sacred. Moreover, it also establishes the reason behind the cults of Hera and Euripius Poseidon at Chalcis. The myth might have also been used to establish a genealogical link between Boeotia and Euboea, two regions that enjoyed great affinity in antiquity, if Arethusa's father is taken to be Hyperes of Boeotia, who was himself a son of Poseidon by the Pleiad Alcyone.\nSee also\nAncient Greece portalMythology portal\nHyria\nArethusa (Ithaca)\n",

The corridor was officially established on 13 December 2023.\nBackground\nAbraham Accords\nMain article: Abraham Accords\nOn 15 September 2020, after the Abraham Accords, a bilateral agreement on Arab\u2013Israeli normalization between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and between Israel and Bahrain, and in the midst of the normalization talks between Saudi Arabia and Israel Mediated by the United States, the land transportation corridor project was launched. \nRed Sea crisis\nMain article: Red Sea crisis\non 28 November 2023, following Israel's ongoing bombardment and raid of the Gaza Strip, Yemen's Houthis launched multiple attacks on ships allegedly moving towards Israel via the Red Sea in support of the Palestinians. The leader of the Houthis, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, warned the United States against intervening in support of Israel, threatening that such an intervention would Drone and missile attacks would have a retaliatory response. The Houthis announced that the condition for ending their attacks in the Red Sea is a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas and an end to Israel's Blockade of the Gaza Strip. \nThe Red Sea crisis in maritime trade, ongoing attacks by Houthi militias on cargo ships, and retaliatory naval and air strikes against the Houthis by US-led Multinational Operation Prosperity Guardian, Israel's shipping and logistics companies have been forced to bypass the Red Sea and use alternative land routes to transport goods from the Far East to Israel.\nEstablishment\nOn 7 July 2023, Ynet reported, that after the Abraham Accords and the development of relations with Arab countries, Israel and the United States are working on a project to establish a continuous trade land bridge connecting the Persian Gulf directly to the seaports of Israel via Jordan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. It is set to expand to Bahrain and Oman later, Ynet reported.\nOn 13 December 2023, Israeli officials said, the UAE-Israel land corridor to deliver cargo from the Persian Gulf States to Israel through Saudi Arabia and Jordan is up and running as an alternative route following the Yemeni group's attacks in the Red Sea. this trade corridor connects from the port of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates or Bahrain, across Saudi Arabia and Jordan, into Israel, and Egypt, leading from the Persian Gulf straight to Israel's seaports. Hanan Fridman, founder at Trucknet Enterprise, an Eilat-based Israeli startup that provides logistics technology for the Arab companies that make the journey, announced that they established an alternative overland trade route e to transfer goods and bypass the Houthi crisis in the Red Sea. Friedman said that while \"sharp demand\" for land cargo services grew exponentially in the wake of the Red Sea crisis, the \"Land Connectivity by Trucks\" project was operational before the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October. This corridor made it possible to transport cargo between Dubai Gulf and the port of Haifa in Israel, while significantly reducing cost and time. In such a way that a 14-day sea journey has been reduced to only four days through this land route.\nSee also\nArab League\nArab League and the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict\nForeign relations of the Arab League\nForeign relations of Israel\n",
    "Brotherhood Economics 1st Edition - Kagawa, Toyohiko - Harper & Brothers, 1936\nBrotherhood economics (Japanese: \u5144\u5f1f\u7d4c\u6e08; Hepburn: Ky\u014ddai Keizai) is a socio-economic concept associated with Toyohiko Kagawa, a Japanese Christian novelist and social reformer, and the author of the book Brotherhood Economics published in 1936. Influenced by his Christian faith and his aversion to warfare, critiqued prevailing political economies of his time\u2014fascism, Soviet-style communism, and capitalism\u2014for their concentration of wealth and power, which he  believed perpetuated poverty. He proposed an alternative model where Christian churches, cooperatives, and pacifist organizations collaborate to foster small, local economies grounded in cooperation.\nHistorical context\nSee also: Toyohiko Kagawa \u00a7\u00a0Activism\nJesus Band Free Clinic\nIn 1909, while studying at the Kobe Theological Seminary, Kagawa moved to Kobe's Shinkawa slums. Here, he engaged in relief work, aiding thousands of impoverished residents. He identified three major weaknesses among the residents: the physically weak, the mentally weak, and the morally weak. Therefore, a core aspect of his Christian mission involved establishing free medical clinics, educational facilities, and spaces for preaching the gospel.\nIn 1914, he traveled to the United States to enroll at Princeton Theological Seminary for three years, pursuing studies in divinity. While there he observed the nearby New York City slums and the workings of urban labor unions.\nKagawa returned to Japan and actively participated in peace initiatives, advocated for labor unions, promoted environmental conservation, and supported the movement for universal suffrage. He faced multiple arrests for his activities, which he viewed as obligations aligned with the principles of a Christian \"Good Samaritan.\" During his periods of imprisonment, Kagawa dedicated his time to writing.\nIn the early 1920s, Kagawa encountered disagreements with radical labor union leaders due to his assertion that spiritual reform must accompany authentic social and economic reform.\nAs he became more influenced by the gradualist ideas of British Guild Socialists and the cooperative movement of the Rochdale Weavers, he started advocating for cooperative economics as a favorable option compared to both communism and capitalism. In 1922, Kagawa declared himself as a \"Guild Socialist\" in terms of his political views, his approach is non-militant, and he could be described as a \"passivist,\" strictly adhering to peaceful methods.\nKagawa published \"Brotherhood Economics\" in 1936, wherein according to him he further develops the themes initially presented in four lectures titled \"Christian Brotherhood and Economic Reconstruction.\" at Colgate-Rochester Divinity School in April 1936.\nSeven cooperatives types\nKagawa advocates for the establishment of seven types of cooperatives: health and life insurance, producers', marketing, credit, mutual aid, public utility, and consumers'. These cooperatives would serve as the foundation of the legislative body within the political state he envisions, emphasizing the necessity of Christian principles for its realization. He contends that without the development of a Christian brotherhood, an ideal economic society cannot be achieved, distinguishing his vision from socialism, communism, and capitalism's exploitative nature.\nKagawa stresses the need to base economic revolution on society as a whole rather than any specific segment, asserting that the labor movement alone cannot accomplish necessary economic reconstruction. Additionally, he emphasizes the importance of a consumption system alongside production, suggesting that private ownership and enterprise could coexist with legislative intervention to safeguard the common good. While Kagawa's proposals include ambitious goals like eradicating corruption and relying on the spirit of the Cross to address economic challenges, he acknowledges the practical limitations and challenges associated with implementing cooperatives.\nApplications\nJapan\nKobe Cooperative Association, COOP Days Aioi (Asahi, Aioi City) in Japan\nIn 1921, Kagawa established the Kobe Consumer Co-operative and the Nada Consumer Co-operative in Kobe. Subsequently, these entities merged to form Co-op Kobe. Additionally, Kagawa was instrumental in founding numerous other cooperatives, including the Kyoto Consumer Co-operative, Tokyo Student's Consumer Co-operative, and Tokyo Iryou (Medical) Consumer Co-operative. Co-op Kobe currently has a membership of 65 million individuals and achieves an annual turnover exceeding $135 billion.\nStudent housing\nThe inception of student co-ops traces back to Gainesville, Florida, and Austin, Texas, in the 1890s, initially as dining clubs. However, the concept of cooperative student housing gained traction during the Great Depression, spurred by economic hardships that prompted students to seek innovative solutions. A pivotal moment occurred with a speaking tour led by Japa",

The pilot was taxiing on grass parallel to the runway when the aircraft went into a ditch. The aircraft's tail and propeller were damaged. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane while taxiing on wet grass.\n",
    "Potato sculpture in New Brunswick, Canada\nBig Potato Man is a sculpture of a large potato man located along Route\u00a0105 in Maugerville, New Brunswick, Canada. Constructed in 1969 by Winston Bronnum, Big Potato Man serves as a form of roadside advertisement for the adjacent farming business.\nDescription\nBig Potato Man is a large potato sculpture in Maugerville, New Brunswick. Made using concrete, it stands at a height of 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) with a thickness of 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m). The sculpture has two legs, arms resembling twigs, a smiling face, and sports a black top hat. Big Potato Man was created in 1969 by sculptor Winston Bronnum for Karl Harvey, as a means to advertise the roadside stand for his family farming business.\nBig Potato Man stands along Route\u00a0105, which was formerly part of the Trans-Canada Highway. Since 1969, it has stood at the front of a farming business.\nHistory\nBackground\nIn 1921, J. H. Harvey bought a farm in Maugerville, a small community along the Saint John River between Fredericton and Oromocto. The Harvey family ran a business, known then as Harvey's, selling vegetables at their roadside stand.\nBig Potato Man\nIn 1968, Karl Harvey, who ran the family farming business at the time, sought the creation for a large potato sculpture, seeking a creative method to advertise his stand. In 1969, Karl had Big Potato Man built. Created by sculptor Winston Bronnum using concrete, the sculpture measured 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) high and had a thickness of 3 feet. Big Potato Man proved successful for the business, with Gordon (Buzz) Harvey, Karl's son, later saying \"he doubled our business within three to four years pretty well.\" Following Karl Harvey's death in 1996, the $1,500 Karl Harvey Memorial Scholarship was posthumously created in his honour. On March 24, 1999, the sculpture was nearly destroyed when a fire struck the business.\nIn November 2015, the farm and home of Big Potato Man, then known as Harvey's Big Potato farm, was put up for sale. Silver Valley Farms began leasing the farm in 2016, and would take ownership of the establishment in September 2021. In April 2022, Silver Valley Farms sought repairs for Big Potato Man, which was at risk of collapsing. However, repair costs quoted at CA$10,000 prompted the creation of a GoFundMe campaign, which quickly racked in support. The fundraiser raised over CA$4,600 within the first 48 hours, and successfully reached its goal within nearly two weeks.\nSee also\nThe World's Largest Lobster, another sculpture made by Bronnum\n",
    "Piano concerto\nThe world premiere of Airat Ichmouratov's Piano Concerto, Jean Philippe Sylvestre piano, Quebec Symphony Orchestra, Palais Montcalm, Quebec, May 1, 2024The Piano Concerto, Op.\u00a040, is a work for piano and orchestra completed by Airat Ichmouratov between 2012 and 2013. Composition remained untouched for a span of ten years until the composer crossed paths with a soloist, Montreal-based pianist Jean-Philippe Sylvestre. Sylvestre's keen enthusiasm for performing the concerto, coupled with his ability to \"do it justice and add finishing touches,\" as described by the composer, led to the revival of the piece. The Piano Concerto was recorded by Chandos on April 19\u201320, 2022, at St. Luke's in London, with Jean-Philippe Sylvestre as the soloist and the London Symphony Orchestra under the baton of the composer. Its first public performance took place on May 1, 2024, at the Palais Montcalm in Quebec City, with Sylvestre as the soloist, accompanied by the Quebec Symphony Orchestra under Ichmouratov.\nStructure\nThe Concerto comprises 3 movements. A typical performance lasts somewhat around 38 minutes.\nAndante affettuosoGrave SolenneAllegro moderato\nIchmouratov, recognized as a significant figure in contemporary neo-romantic music internationally and often hailed as a prominent Russian musical figure in Quebec, openly acknowledges the influence of esteemed Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, Mussorgsky, and Shostakovich, among others, on his music. This influence is evident in his typical style, characterized by neo-romanticism, in this case, a Piano Concerto, featuring melodious and harmonically rich content infused with elements drawn from Russian folk music.\nAccording to Geoff Pearce of Classical Music Daily the composition unfolds across three distinct movements. Exhibiting a romantic flair, the musical style is characterized by virtuosity and a somewhat rhapsodic nature. Filled with abundant energy, it includes frequent mood changes. The first movement encapsulates the essence of the entire piece and could function effectively as an independent work. It traverses a spectrum of emotions, ranging from fervently virtuosic passages to moments of dramatic intensity and serene reflection. The orchestral sections demonstrate skillful composition, while the solo passages require significant technical proficiency from the instruments, especially the woodwinds. The piano part adheres to the tradition of late nineteenth-century Russian piano concertos. \nAte\u015f Orga mentions in his article on Colin's Column the form of the concerto, labeling it as an \"episodic traversal\". He describes the Piano Concerto as an episodic journey, traversing through tempo-contrasted sections. Ideas, once introduced, are revisited in various forms\u2014sometimes abbreviated, hinted at, or even left unresolved\u2014reflecting the unpredictable nature of Ichmouratov's approach to keys. \"When I compose, I'm guided by a particular tonality and simply follow its course, often leading to unexpected key relationships,\" composer explains. Michael Church of BBC Music Magazine also calls Ichmouratov's form in Piano concerto as \"episodic\".\nI. Andante affettuoso - Allegro vivace - Andante cantabile - Allegro vivace\nFrom the beginning, the timpani alternate between tonic and dominant, as observed in Arthur Kaptainis's analysis. The piano enters with a contemplative melody in D Minor, softly articulated in octaves. This theme evolves harmonically and transitions into an Allegro vivace, where the piano and woodwinds engage in exchange. The buoyant atmosphere gradually diminishes as the piano introduces a noble Andante cantabile theme through a short recitative in G minor. A grand climax featuring the full orchestra gives way to a piano cadenza. Although the recapitulation initially returns to the expected home key of D minor, it eventually resolves in a resolute conclusion in G minor, accentuated by the soloist's assertive fortissimo double octaves.\nMain theme in the first movement of Ichmouratov's Piano concerto, Piano solo part\nmm. 3\u20136\nAudio playback is not supported in your browser.

Grave Solenne\nArthur Kaptainis notes that the Ichmouratov regards the central movement, Grave solenne, as a personal reflection encompassing \"my thoughts, my feelings, my nostalgia, my sorrow, and my happiness.\" It begins with a solemn chorale for strings, evoking heartfelt sentiments reminiscent of the final movement of Mahler's Third Symphony. Although initially in C Major, the atmosphere conveys a distinct melancholy, with much of the movement set i",

    "\nGlobe by the firm of Jan Felkl dated 1875, from the Museum of Science and Technology, Belgrade (Serbia)\nJan Felkl (20 May 1817 \u2013 7 October 1887) was a Czech globe maker and industrialist. He came from Ban\u00edn, but settled in Prague where he got to know cartographer and globe maker V\u00e1clav Merklas. Merklas soon after gifted his tools to Felkl, who set up his own workshop in the Old Town of Prague in the early 1850s.\nFelkl's company grew rapidly and was eventually to become the most important and internationally most well-known globe manufacturing firm of Austria-Hungary. In 1870 the factory for the manufacturing of Felkl's globes relocated from Prague to the nearby town of Roztoky. By 1873 it produced 15,000 globes annually and, by 1877, in 17 languages. After Jan Felkl's death, the company continued to produce globes until 1952, when it closed due to setbacks suffered from market loss after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, legal conflicts, World War II, the installation of the Communist regime, and not least stiffening competition.\nEarly life\nJan Felkl was born on 20 May 1817 in Ban\u00edn, in what is today the Czech Republic but was then the Austrian Empire. He was the son of an ethnic German farmer. His interest in globe making was supposedly born when he was a conscripted soldier in the Imperial Austrian Army, and had a superior whose hobby was globe making. With the military he came to Prague, where he after his discharge found a job working for the postal service and settled in Hrad\u010dany. In Prague he got to know cartographer V\u00e1clav Merklas\u00a0, who had made the first Czech-language globe in 1848. Merklas soon thereafter took up a teaching position and abandoned further attempts at globe making, and therefore gifted his tools to Felkl in 1849. Felkl moved to the Old Town in 1850 and only began producing his own globes sometimes after this. They were initially copies of Merklas' models with diameters of 2.5 inches (6.4\u00a0cm), 3.5 inches (8.9\u00a0cm) and 4.5 inches (11\u00a0cm), respectively. Two friends from his military days helped Felkl set up his workshop. He formally founded a globe making company in 1854.\nGlobe manufacturing\nThe business grew rapidly. In 1855, the firm produced 800 globes annually; by 1873 it had expanded to 15,000 globes annually. Felkl employed a simple manufacturing technique, whereby plaster globes were moulded in brass moulds, onto which printed and initially hand-painted paper slips were attached. Later, some globes would also be made of cardboard. With the introduction of colouring by lithography, as opposed to by hand, production costs went down further. The printing was done in Prague but from the outset also in Leipzig. With the rapid growth of the company, in 1870 the factory for the manufacturing of Felkl's globes relocated from Prague to the nearby town of Roztoky. At that time, the company employed around 24 people. Felkl also set up his own lithographic printing office in Prague c. 1873. In the same year, at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair, Felk's globes were awarded the first prize, and the next year one of the German-language versions of the globes was approved for use in primary and secondary schools in Austria-Hungary. This was followed by an approval in 1879 to use a Czech-language version in Czech-language schools. Felkl's son entered the company in 1875 as his father's business partner, whereafter the firm was known as \"Felkl & Son\". The firm had its heyday in the 1890s. At its peak, it was the most important and internationally most well-known globe manufacturing firm of Austria-Hungary. It dominated the domestic market and exported thousands of globes.\nThough his first globe models were with text in Czech, early on he began printing and manufacturing globes in German, which opened a larger market. Felkl thereafter soon expanded to producing globes in other languages as well, using translations from the German-language globes. By 1861 Felkl produced globes in English, Dutch, Hungarian, Polish and Russian. By 1877, Felkl's company offered globes in 17 different languages.\nAlready in 1855, Felkl also produced a celestial globe, which he had developed with the aid of the director of the Prague observatory, Joseph B\u00f6hm. Felkl also cooperated with others in producing his terrestrial globes, including German geographer Otto Delitsch\u00a0 (who aided Felkl in designing a relief globe) and Czech statistician Josef Erben\u00a0, who collaborated with Felkl on finding the right terminology for the Czech globes. Apart from globes, the company also produced a range of other instruments such as telluria and orreries.\nJan Felkl married Maria Anna Jakob and the couple had nine children. Jan Felkl died on 7 October 1887. After his death, the company continued to operate and remained a family business. Production stood still between the advent of World War I in 1914 and 1921. The dissolution of Austria-Hungary after the war meant that the domestic market vanished. The company had a second period of success a",

    "Bilateral relations\nIraq\u2013Somalia relations refer to foreign relations between Iraq and Somalia. Both nations are Arab League & Organisation of Islamic Cooperation members and maintain relations.\nHistory\nDiplomatic relations between Iraq and Somalia was established on 17 October 1966. Like other neighbouring nations, both nations underwent socialist military coups in the late 1960s, Iraq's 17 July Revolution in 1968 and Somalia's 1969 coup d'\u00e9tat. This provided Ba'athist Iraq and the Somali Democratic Republic opportunities to collaborate in technical, military and economic affairs. Up until the collapse of their respective governments, Iraq and Somalia maintained a special relationship. In Somalia, there are numerous towns and villages named after things and places from Iraq, i.e. Baqdaad, Middle Shabelle.\nIraq was one of Somalia's top trading partners and Iraq invested and constructed energy infrastructure within Somalia. Iraq also provided scholarships for Somali students to study at Iraqi universities as it did for other Arab states. Somalia would also sell armaments & components to Iraq to bolster Iraq's domestic military industry. Additionally, Somalia is heavily suspected to be a major source of fissile material in Iraqi attempts to construct a nuclear weapon. In fact, despite not having a functioning government at the time, the United States Intelligence Community's National Intelligence Estimate of 2002 stated that Somalia was one of the suspected nations to be a source of yellowcake uranium.\nIn 1973, Somalia strongly supported the Arab coalition of the Yom Kippur War in which Iraq was a major participant.\nIn 1977, the Ogaden War broke out, Iraq was staunchly pro-Somalia, sending infantry, military intelligence officers and even sent the expeditionary No. 11 Squadron, Iraqi Air Force led by then-Colonel Hakam Hassan\u00a0 in support of the Somali Air Force. Furthermore, Iraq refused to let Soviet Air Force fighters to refuel in Iraq and not allow them to use Iraqi airspace for the Soviet intervention in the war. Iraq's friction with the Soviet Union surrounding other issues allowed Iraq to grow closer to Somalia.\nIn 1980, Iraq invaded Iran and the subsequent Iran\u2013Iraq War occurs, with Iranian attacks on Iraqi oil installations throughout the 1980s, Iraq is unable to provide Somalia with investments and with Somalia's then tense relationships with both the United States and Soviet Union, Somalia enters a period of sharp decline.\nSomalia was strongly and deeply against the 2003 invasion and subsequent Iraq War. Notably, there were major anti-war protests in Mogadishu in support of Iraq.\nDiplomatic missions\nSomalia has an embassy in Baghdad, and Iraq is slated to reopen its embassy in Mogadishu. The current Somali ambassador to Iraq is Dr. Liban Sheikh Mahmood and Iraq currently maintains a non-resident embassy in Nairobi.\n",

After the victory at Oran, king Philip II of Spain decided to take advantage by launching a counter strike against Barbary haven, which is Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera.\nExpedition\nIn 1563, the Spanish prepared another campaign against Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera. The command was given to Don Sanco de Leyva. The Spanish prepared an armada of 50 galleys and 7,000 men. The Spanish armada left M\u00e1laga on July 23. At Pe\u00f1\u00f3n, the Spanish governor, Pedro Venegas, made a plan by scaling the walls at night. He had fifty volunteers, accompanied by the eighth galleys of \u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n; however, the assault ended in failure after someone made a noise which alarmed the garrison and alarmed the others by firing cannons and dawn had arrived.\nDespite this failure, Sancho did not give up and landed between 4,000 and 5,000 men six miles away from the rock in an attempt to capture it by land, however, the night assault again ended in failure as the defenders were alarmed. Ottoman galleys began appearing to support the garrison. The failure of the assault frustrated Sancho who held a council. The majority agreed to withdraw, except \u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n, who argued for the continuation of the campaign. He even proposed ideas for another assault, but Sancho ordered the troops to reembark.\nThe Spanish troops began leaving, but during their retreat, the Ottoman garrison and the Gomera Berbers attacked them with their artillery, inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish. The Muslims had acquired great loot the Spanish left. The Spanish returned to Malaga on August 2.\n",
    "Office building in San Diego, California, United States\n101 Ash Street is an unoccupied office building in the downtown core of San Diego, California. The steel and concrete structure was built in 1967 on a rectangular 180\u00a0ft (55\u00a0m) x 70\u00a0ft (21\u00a0m) footprint. The building is 21 stories with two additional underground levels for a basement-to-roof height of 315\u00a0ft (96\u00a0m) and a square footage of 447,732\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (41,595.7\u00a0m2), including the 240-car garage.\nThe building was occupied by San Diego Gas & Electric (SDGE) from 1968 to 1998, and then by SDGE parent Sempra Energy from 1998 to 2015.\nIn 2016, Mayor Kevin Faulconer announced a $128 million lease-to-own deal under which the city would acquire the building as-is from owner Cisterra Development and at the end of the 20-year lease own the building free-and-clear. After the deal closed in January 2017, asbestos was discovered, complicating needed renovation work and delaying the move of workers into the building. In August 2018, the San Diego City Council approved a Faulconer administration plan to invest an additional $30 million into the site for renovations. Hundreds of city workers were moved into the building in December 2019; however, by January 2020, the mayor announced an evacuation of the building for safety reasons following asbestos violations by county regulators.\nIn September 2020, the city suspended monthly lease payments due to a lawsuit brought by a resident seeking to nullify the original contract and recover taxpayer losses. In July 2022, the City Council approved a settlement with Cisterra Development, agreeing to pay the developer $86 million for the property while receiving back a refund of $7.5 million from the original lease-to-own payments. San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott, who approved the initial deal, had urged the council to reject the proposal. The city recuperated an additional $9.4 million in March 2023 after suing Jason Hughes, the real estate broker on the original deal.\nIn August 2023, La Jolla developer Reven Capital proposed converting the building into affordable housing as a part of the city's request for proposals on future development for the site and surrounding publicly owned land.\nSee also\nDowntown San Diego\n",

    "College ice hockey team season\nThe 1920\u201321 Amherst men's ice hockey season was the 8th season of play for the program.\nSeason\nAmherst had high hoped for its first full season since 1914 and got to work right after the football season was finished. Pratt Field was once again the team's home and once the rink had finished freezing, the prospective players were put through their paces. However, after returning from the exam break, several players (including Leon Plumer) were ruled academically ineligible and would not be able to play for the rest of the season.\nThe handicapped purple opened their season against one of the nation's top teams in Dartmouth. Though they lost, Amherst showed a solid level of compete by keeping the score close. A few days later, the team got its first home game of the season and met cross-town rivals Massachusetts Agricultural. Goaltender Francis Plimpton was the star for Amherst but he was unable to help the team with its biggest problem: scoring. The purple were only able to get six shots on goal for the entire game and, although Davidson was able to get one marker, it wasn't enough and the team lost 1\u20132. The next game had virtually the same outcome with Davidson getting the only goal for Amherst in a 1\u20132 loss and it was becoming quite apparent that the missing talent was holding the team back.\nA week later, Amherst was off to play YMCA College and the team got off to a fast start. The purple got an early lead but were unable to build on the advantage. YMCA tied the game in the second half but Plimpton prevented any further scoring and the two went into overtime. The Maroons struck quick and took the lead, then held Amherst off for the remainder of the match. Two more losses in quick succession left the team with just one final opportunity to get a win. Unfortunately, the offense wasn't able to get anything going in the rematch with Williams and Amherst ended the year with a perfect losing season.\nBradford L. Church served as team manager with Frank A. Myers as his assistant.\nNote: Amherst teams did not have any nickname prior to 1921.\nRoster\n\nStandings\nSchedule and results\n",
    "Species of lichen found in high-altitude habitats\nPeltigera alkalicola is a rare species of terricolous (ground-dwelling) foliose lichen in the family Peltigeraceae. First described in 2022 from specimens collected in the Kilimanjaro National Park in Tanzania, it is characterised by its unique ecological preferences. Analysis of DNA samples indicate that the lichen may also occur in Alaska, USA, and Ningxia, China, suggesting a wider distribution in cold, montane ecosystems.\nTaxonomy\nPeltigera alkalicola was formally described by the Finnish lichenologist Ulla Kaasalainen in 2022. It is closely related to Peltigera lepidophora but can be distinguished by its smaller size, the distinct colour of its isidia, and its genetic makeup. The type specimen of Peltigera alkalicola was collected in Tanzania within the Kilimanjaro National Park, specifically between the Maua and Marangu routes. It was found on soil amidst Helichrysum heath at an elevation of 4,390\u00a0m (14,400\u00a0ft). This collection, made on 8 June 2017, is designated as the holotype. The specific epithet alkalicola refers to the species' preference for alkaline substrates, particularly the alkaline trachybasaltic lava found in its type locality.\nDescription\nPeltigera alkalicola forms a small thallus, typically 1\u20135\u00a0cm (3\u20448\u20132\u00a0in) in diameter, but usually smaller, about 1\u20132\u00a0cm (3\u20448\u20133\u20444\u00a0in). It has thick, rounded to elongate lobes that are up to 1\u20132 cm long and 1\u00a0cm wide. The lobes often have rounded ends with upturned margins and may appear slightly crisped. The upper surface is tomentose, often slightly scabrous, and greyish-brown in colour. In contrast, the lower surface is generally white to pale brown, with veins that are the same colour or slightly darker and rhizines that are more abundant centrally, becoming shorter near the margins. This species develops peltate isidia, which are small, dark brown to almost black outgrowths on the upper surface that are distinctly darker than the thallus surface.\nThe species does not typically produce apothecia (sexual reproductive structures) or pycnidia (asexual reproductive structures), and no secondary metabolites (lichen products) have been detected by thin-layer chromatography. All standard chemical spot tests are negative.\nHabitat, distribution, and ecology\nPeltigera alkalicola is found in high-elevation habitats, specifically in open, subalpine and alpine heathlands at elevations between 3,940 and 4,390\u00a0m (12,930 and 14,400\u00a0ft). It is adapted to growing on trachybasaltic volcanic rock, a type of alkaline substrate, and is often associated with sparse vegetation and bryophytes. At the time of its original publication, the species was known to occur only from a few locations on Mt Kilimanjaro and is considered rare. The collection sites for Peltigera alkalicola receive between 900 and 1,100\u00a0mm (35 and 43\u00a0in) of rainfall annually, maintain a relative humidity of 60 to 80%, and have an average annual temperature of 4\u00a0\u00b0C (39\u00a0\u00b0F).\nInitially discovered in Tanzania, genetic analysis suggests that Peltigera alkalicola may also be present in Alaska, USA, and Ningxia, China, indicating a wider distribution across diverse and extreme habitats. This distribution pattern highlights the species' preference for cold, montane regions and alkaline substrata.\n",
    "\nHealth systems science (HSS) is a foundational platform and framework for the study and understanding of how care is delivered, how health professionals work together to deliver that care, and how the health system can improve patient care and health care delivery. It is one of the three pillars of medical education along with the basic and clinical sciences. HSS includes the following core foundational domains: health care structure and process; health system improvement; value in health care; population, public, and social determinants of health; clinical informatics and health technology; and health care policy and economics. It also includes four functional domains: ethics and legal; change agency, management, and advocacy; teaming; and leadership. Systems thinking links all of these domains together. Patient, family, and community are at the center of HSS.\nHistory and development\nHSS, which was originally referred to as systems-based practice, emerged in response to the growing recognition that effective health care delivery requires more than just clinical expertise. It acknowledges that health care systems are complex, adaptive systems influenced by a multitude of factors, including social determinants of health, policy decisions, organizational structures, and patient preferences.\nThe World Health Organization first recognized the need to educate physicians about the link between health and the systems in which people live, work, and play in 1978. The quality and patient safety movement of the 1980s and 1990s further reinforced the need for physicians to understand systems thinking. The Association of American Medical Colleges' Core Entrustable Professional Activities for Entering Residency (CEPAERs) started including identifying system failures and making contributions to a culture of safety and improvement in 1999. That year, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education also included systems-based practice as one of its six core competency domains. In 2001, the Health Resources and Services Administration funded an 18-medical-school consortium to launch several pilots related to systems-based education. In 2005, the book, Professionalism in Tomorrow's Healthcare System, outlined several aspects of the systems-based practice competency.\nMedical schools and residency and fellowship programs, however, struggled to teach these competencies. The framework for HSS was developed to address this struggle and is built on a foundation of systems thinking and the biopsychosocial model developed by George L. Engel. It aims to educate physicians to become systems citizens.\nFrom 2013 to 2015 the American Medical Association's (AMA) Accelerating Change in Medical Education consortium of 11\u2009U.S. medical schools worked to identify a comprehensive framework for HSS training. In 2017, a review of 30 grant submissions to the AMA Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative and an analysis of the HSS-related curricula at the 11 medical schools that were members of the Accelerating Change in Medical Education consortium formed the groundwork toward the development of a potential comprehensive HSS curricular framework with domains and subcategories.\nBarriers to incorporating HSS into medical education include student resistance because it is not always viewed as essential to passing physician licensing and credentialing exams and limitations in the number of medical school faculty with expertise to teach HSS domains.\nAn increasing number of new medical schools have created their initial curriculum with HSS fully integrated including Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine, which matriculated its first class in July 2020, and the Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, which is expected to matriculate its first class in 2025.\nFuture directions\nAs health care continues to evolve, the importance of HSS is expected to grow. Efforts to integrate HSS into medical education and practice will be essential for preparing physicians to navigate the complexities of modern health care delivery, advocate for their patients, and contribute to improving the health of populations.\nHSS is also expanding to other health professions. In 2023, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a series of workshops focused on integrating HSS across the learning curriculum. HSS has been expanding to physician assistants, nurses, and other health care professionals.\nNotable figures and organizations\nSusan Skochelak, MD, MPH, creator of the Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative and lead editor of the first and second editions of the Health Systems Science textbook.\nSchools involved in the AMA Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative that helped create the HSS framework:\nWarren Alpert Medical School of Brown University\nBrody School of Medicine at East Carolina University\nUniversity of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine\nUniversity of California, Davis, School of ",

She is the widow of Puerto Rican politician, lawyer, medical doctor, and scholar Leopoldo Figueroa.\nEarly years and background\nCarmen Maria Vazquez Rivera was born on February 15, 1922, in Cidra, Puerto Rico. Vazquez is the daughter of Maria Engracia Rivera y Rodriguez and Nicasio Vazquez Noguera. She was the first of six children, and niece of the regional Cidra-based businessman Manuel Rivera, Maria Engracia's brother. Carmen and her siblings Nicasio, Laura, Roberto, Jose and Carola, were raised in Cidra.\nMedical career\nIn 1938 Vazquez decided to pursue a career in medicine at the age of sixteen and began studies to become a nurse. She first studied nursing in the Escuela del Distrito de Bayam\u00f3n, where she graduated in 1942. She then continued her education with a course in obstetrics from the Hospital de la Capital de San Juan. There she served in numerous capacities including as an anesthesiologist of dystocic cases, auxiliary operating room supervisor, and instructor of auxiliary nurses. During this period she also joined the Red Cross. In addition to her nursing education, Vazquez also studied Domestic Economy from the University of Puerto Rico.\nMilitary service\nWorld War II\nAt the start of the United States involvement in WWII, the US Army and Navy Nurse Corps were not accepting Puerto Rican nurses. This position was reversed in April 1944, and Vazquez joined the US Army that first year in December as a nurse. She quickly served in numerous leadership capacities, including becoming Head Nurse in charge of the orthopedic department San Juan's Fort Brooke and held the rank of Second Lieutenant. Vazquez's other roles included serving as an auxiliary operating room supervisor, an instructor of auxiliary nurses, as well as performing the delivery of over 100 births.\nFollowing the conclusion of the war, Vazquez became a decorated veteran following her wartime service and received a signed letter from President Truman. She was later transferred to the hospital of Trinidad in 1946, after which she was honorably discharged and returned to her civilian nursing career.\nKorean War\nFirst Lieutenant Carmen Maria Vazquez Rivera during her service in the United States Air Force, circa 1953\nIn 1953 Vazquez was recruited back to the armed services during the Korean War. For her second period of service, Vazquez was promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant and served in the US Air Force. Following her Air Force service, Vazquez remained in the US Air Force Nurse Corps Reserve for twenty years until 1973.\nPost-military career and later years\nFollowing her WWII service, Vazquez returned to her civilian nursing career and relocated to New York in the late 1940s. In New York she studied physical therapy in Columbia University and practiced nursing at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Vazquez also studied and was certified in Criminology from Bolan Academy in New York.\nShe then moved to Miami Beach where, in 1955, she became licensed to practice nursing in the state of Florida. While in Miami Beach she practiced in Mount Sinai Hospital. By the 1960s Vazquez had relocated back to Puerto Rico and lived in the capital of San Juan. There she would donate her specialized medical background in service of the community as a Mutual Aid nurse and volunteer.\nFollowing her retirement in Puerto Rico, Vazquez later relocated to the Florida capital of Tallahassee and became a member of several US veterans organizations including the American Legion and the Veterans Club of the 65th Infantry, the latter of which became known as \"The Borinqueneers\u201d during the Korean War.\nVazquez turned 100 in 2022, during which a resurgence of interest in her life and career resulted in several honors and recognitions from public figures and organizations.\nPersonal life\nVazquez was twice married to Puerto Rican medical doctor, lawyer, politician, and scholar Leopoldo Figueroa. The couple first met in the San Jan\u00a0municipal hospital\u00a0when Figueroa was\u00a0Vazquez's\u00a0clinical instructor in the obstetrician ward during\u00a0the 1940s. The pair were married following the conclusion of WWII, though they would divorce before the end of the decade.\nIn the 1950s Vazquez had had three children, a son and two daughters. She had her son Gabriel with Edward Lewison in 1954, her daughter Janice with medical doctor Jose Vigoreux in 1955, and her daughter Carol with her second husband Paul E. Giguere in 1957. While in Puerto Rico, Vazquez and Giguere had divorced by the end of the decade, after which Vazquez reunited with Figueroa who had himself also divorced from his second wife. After reuniting, the couple remarried in 1963 and remained together until Figueroa's death in 1969. \u00a0Vazquez cared for Figueroa as his health declined during his finals years.\nMilitary service decorations\nAmong Vazquez's service awards an",
    "Mexican politician\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  de la Garza and the second or maternal family name is  Santos.\nAdri\u00e1n Emilio de la Garza Santos (born 17 September 1971) is a Mexican lawyer and politician who served as the municipal president of Monterrey from 2015 to 2021 and as the attorney general of Nuevo Le\u00f3n from 2011 to 2015.\nEarly life and education\nDe la Garza was born on 17 September 1971 in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n to Filiberto de la Garza de la Garza and Sandra Santos. His father served as the attorney general of Nuevo Le\u00f3n from 1977 to 1979.\nAttorney General of Nuevo Le\u00f3n\nOn 3 February 2011, the Governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz, announced that he would nominate de la Garza as Attorney General. Seven days later, the Congress of Nuevo Le\u00f3n held an extraordinary session and unanimously confirmed his nomination.\nDuring his tenure, the Attorney General's Office was restructured to create three regional offices: north, central, and south; the AMBER Alert system was implemented in the state; new uniforms for the Attorney General's Office were introduced; the new organic law of the state prosecutor's office was published, the Specialized Group for Immediate Search was created, and the renovation of the State Investigation Agency building was initiated.\nOn 24 January 2015, de la Garza resigned in order to contend for the Institutional Revolutionary Party's nomination for the municipal president of Monterrey in the 2015 state election.\nLink to Los Zetas\nIn October 2016, a police report by the Spanish National Police Corps implicated de la Garza as one of several political contacts of Juan Manuel Mu\u00f1oz Lu\u00e9vano, alias \"El Mono\", during his tenure as Attorney General. This conclusion was drawn from years of wiretapping Mu\u00f1oz Lu\u00e9vano. Earlier in the same year, Mu\u00f1oz Lu\u00e9vano had been arrested for his alleged involvement in coordinating the transportation of cocaine into Europe for Los Zetas.\nMunicipal president of Monterrey\nElections\n2015\nOn 15 January 2015, candidate registrations for the Institutional Revolutionary Party began. One week later, Senator Marcela Guerra, who had registered as a precandidate for the municipal president of Monterrey, withdrew in favor of de la Garza. The following day, de la Garza resigned from his position as attorney general to register as a precandidate for municipal president of Monterrey.\nOn 27 February 2015, the PRI confirmed him as their candidate, and on 2 March 2015, he registered with the State Electoral Commission as the candidate for the coalition Alianza por tu Seguridad, which consisted of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Ecologist Green Party of Mexico, New Alliance Party, and the Democratic Party.\nIn the election, de la Garza won with 34.4% of the votes, defeating his nearest opponent by nearly 8 points.\n2018\nIn early 2018, de la Garza shared a video on social media confirming his intention to seek reelection.\nIn the election, de la Garza lost to Felipe de Jes\u00fas Cant\u00fa of the National Action Party by 4,679 votes. De la Garza contested the election at the Electoral Tribunal of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, which decided to annul ballot boxes favoring the National Action Party, thereby reversing the result and granting the office to de la Garza. However, the regional chamber of the Federal Electoral Tribunal overturned this decision, declaring Cant\u00fa the winner. De la Garza appealed to the highest chamber of the Federal Electoral Tribunal, which annulled the election and scheduled a special election for December.\nThe special election was held on 23 December 2018, in which de la Garza won with 41.22% of the vote, becoming the first municipal president of Monterrey to be reelected for a consecutive term. Turnout for this election was significantly lower than the previous one, with only 33.04% of citizens voting, compared to the 59.7% turnout in the previous election.\nTenure\nFiscal policy\nIn his first year in office, de la Garza restructured Monterrey's debt, reducing the debt inherited from his predecessor, Margarita Arellanes Cervantes, by approximately 27%. By 2020, he had reduced it by 23% when compared to the initial amount. These efforts, combined with proactive tax policies, prompted various credit rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor's, HR Ratings, and Moody\u2019s, to upgrade the municipality's credit rating, placing it above Mexico's average credit rating.\nCrime and policing\nDuring De la Garza's tenure, the municipality added 780 new vehicles to the police force between 2017 and 2020, built a new police academy with an investment of MXN $110 million, and, as part of the Sistema de Seguridad e Inteligencia (in English: Security and Intelligence System), installed four thousand CCTV cameras, establishing the city's first security camera system. However, in late 2021, his successor, Luis Donaldo Colosio Riojas, revealed that half of the security camera network was not functional and that 277 of the 452 patrol cars were inoperable.\nDe la ",

Yet the Australian commits to his nerdily sketchy, cinematically-framed hour with such vein-bulging energy, sprightly imagination and crowd-pumping zeal that you're swept along in its looping, mind-bending journey.\" He added that the show is also \"an effective satire on pretentious comedians' egotistical delusions and their self-inflicted punishment\".\nDan McInnes, reviewing for the Australian Arts Review, wrote that \"Solo is the kind of guy who seems to persist with paradox past the point that most of us give up\", adding that, \"along with his bumbling enjoyment of his own material, awkward moments are also part of his charm.\" Fynn Ryan wrote for Isolated Nation that \"Solo's brand of comedy is a chaotic and inclusive event which is at its best when the audience are in on the joke.\" However, he noted that some audience members \"may be put-off by Solo's hyperactive and post-modern\" style. Kym Clayton, of The Barefoot Review, described Solo in Palindrome as eccentric, unconventional, and intelligent. She praised his ability to \"turn sharp observation and oh-so-funny acidic comment on the seemingly ordinary things we do and the trite things we say in our daily lives\".\nSolo won the best comedy weekly award at the 2023 Adelaide Fringe and the 2024 Fringe World in Perth.\nPersonal life\nSolo lives  in Melbourne, Australia.\n",

Ukraine declared that it would not acknowledge Putin as the president of Russia. This will be the first full term served after the 2020 Russian constitutional amendments which established a hard two-term limit. It is expected that the government will resign as usual.

The club's first team participated in the DFB-Pokal in 2001.\nHistory\nThe football club was founded in 1949 and for many decades played at the district level. In 2000, the club achieved promotion to the district league for the first time, followed by a rapid ascent to the Landesliga Mittelrhein (Mittelrhein League). In 2001, under the guidance of coach Nissim Beniesch, Blau-Wei\u00df Br\u00fchl reached the final of the Mittelrheinpokal (Mittelrhein Cup) and defeated the reserves of Bayer 04 Leverkusen in the process. On May 24, 2001, they won the final against Borussia Freialdenhoven with a score of 3\u20132. This made the team the first seventh-tier club to qualify for the DFB-Pokal 2001/02. In the DFB-Pokal, Blau-Wei\u00df Br\u00fchl, now playing at the sixth-tier level due to their previous promotion, faced Bundesliga side 1. FC Kaiserslautern and lost 1\u20134 after initially taking a 1\u20130 lead in front of approximately 6,000 spectators.\nSubsequently, Blau-Wei\u00df Br\u00fchl achieved another promotion to the Verbandsliga Mittelrhein (Mittelrhein Association League) in the league competition. However, in the 2002/03 season, the team narrowly avoided relegation, and a year later, they finished in last place and were relegated back to the Landesliga. The merger of TuRa Hennef with FC Geistingen to form FC Hennef 05 prevented Br\u00fchl from being relegated to the Bezirksliga. Nonetheless, they were eventually relegated to that league in 2006 due to sporting reasons. With the absence of sporting success and further relegations to the Kreisliga A and Kreisliga B in 2008, Blau-Wei\u00df Br\u00fchl also lost important players and officials.\nIn the 2008/09 season, the team was withdrawn from competitive play and the club was ultimately dissolved. This development was facilitated by the simultaneous success of local rivals SC Br\u00fchl 06/45, who achieved promotion to the fifth-tier Mittelrheinliga in 2008.\nHonors\nWinner of the Middle Rhine Cup in 2001\nNotable personalities\nFuat K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\nWolodymyr Ljutyj\nMohamed Azima\n",

    "\nSoumaine Ndodeba alias Tarzan is a Central African warlord from Vakaga.\nLife\nEarly career\nOriginally from Tiringoulou and a Gula, Ndodeba began his career as a guard for the Northern Region Development Program (PDRN) in 1997. When he worked as a guard, he gained military and tracking training from French, Swiss, American, and British trainers. From 2004 to 2007, he joined the elite private anti-poaching guard and conducted operations against hunters and herders. The guard was led by two Russians and ex-Foreign Legionnaires who dwelled at the Sangba base. He received a salary from a charity organization named the Association for the Protection of Central African Wildlife. While working at the elite guard, Russians gave Ndodeba the nickname Tarzan.\nRebellion\nIn April 2006, an unknown airplane landed at Tiringoulou airstrip, prompting the government to send Presidential Guard to the town, and they attacked the residents as well as burned houses. After the attack, Ndodeba returned to Tiringoulou to check on his family. However, he fled to the bush. In the bush, he found his colleagues who planned the uprising against the government. Soon after, he trained military skills to his companions in the bush. From there, he earned the title of colonel.\nNdodeba joined UFDR because he felt dismayed by the Ministry of Water and Forest's decision to choose only the trackers from Bangui and the surrounding area. He and his group launched an attack in Birao at the end of October 2006 and managed to seize the weapons from the government forces.\nNdodeba returned to his hometown, and an American medical charity appointed him as the local children's rights advocate. Apart from that, they trained him to be a football coach. As the government signed peace agreements with UFDR, he wanted to participate in the DDR program, hoping that he would receive training and money and be employed at government institutions. However, the program ended up in vain.\nIn December 2012, Ndodeba joined Seleka. As the Seleka tried to enter Bangui, he was shot and flown to Gabon for further medical treatment. He was then released from the hospital and returned to Tiringoulou for recovery. Afterward, he went to Bambari and joined RPRC. As he joined RPRC, his rank was promoted from colonel to general, and he became one of the group's important military leaders. He was designated as RPRC leader in Bambari. On 24 February 2017, he left Bambari due to the MINUSCA intervention that wanted to prevent the UPC-RPRC clash.  He later left RPRC and joined PRNC in 2019.\n",

    "Residential district in Mulhouse\nAdministration\nDornach is one of the main affluent residential districts of Mulhouse intra muros, bordering Morschwiller-le-Bas and Lutterbach. It is an ancient settlement that owes its name to the Celts, a name that the Romans later Latinized into Durnacum and Germanized into Dornach. Dornach was once an autonomous commune, and for a long time served as a border village between the independent Republic of Mulhouse and Upper Alsace (of which it was a part), which was alternately under French and German rule. As such, it was home to the local Jewish and Catholic bourgeoisie, who could not stay in the territory of the Republic of Mulhouse due to the adoption of the exclusive Calvinist religion.\nIn 1908, under the German Empire, the town, whose population had grown strongly in the 19th century thanks to industrial development, asked to be merged with Mulhouse, as it couldn't solve the problems associated with urban development. The merger took effect in 1914, the year the district was the scene of the Battle of Dornach. The former Dornach industrial district of Brustlein became a fully-fledged Mulhouse district, while the Daguerre district, previously located in both communes, was unified, and the City of Mulhouse used the undeveloped parts of the commune to build the Haut-Poirier district (Illberg and Bel Air) and the Coteaux district. The former village area the west of the Strasbourg \u2192 Basel railroad line, located between the Dornach fairgrounds and the commune of Lutterbach, became the Mulhouse district of Dornach, which took on its current boundaries.\nAt the start of the 21st century, Dornach retains its village-style urban layout, making it an attractive residential area. The proximity of a large peripheral shopping area, two university campuses and two business parks, combined with motorway and rail links (Zu-Rhein, Mulhouse-Dornach and Mus\u00e9es stations) and the presence of the tramway (Line 3, Mulhouse Vall\u00e9e de la Thur tram-train) further enhance this appeal. The late 20th and early 21st centuries were marked by the development of the ever-expanding Mulhouse Technology Crescent to the north, south, and west of the district.\nGeography\nThe Dornach district lies to the west of Mulhouse. A tributary of the Dollar River, the Steinbaechlein, runs through the district, having been canalized in the 19th century when the area was industrialized.\nTransport\nThe district is served by the Mulhouse-Dornach train station and by public transport in the Mulhouse area.\nNeighboring towns and districts\nToponymy\nAlsatian: Durni. Derived from Turnach (1250) from the Gallo-Roman etymon Turnacum, meaning \u201cwhere there is a rise in the ground\u201d. This word has the same etymology as Tournay and Tournai (Doornik) in Belgium.\nHistory\nPrehistory\nEvidence of Dornach's occupation dates back to the Neolithic period, with carved flints and axes discovered at the foot of the Illberg. Remains from the Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne periods include tombs, Vilannovian fibulae, Gallic coins, and other objects. The Romans Latinized the name Durnachos to Durnacum or Turnacum. During major invasions, the area was occupied by the Alamanni and Franks, who Germanized the name to Turnich, Durnich, Durnach, and finally Dornach.\nMiddle Ages\nIn the Middle Ages, the village of Dornach belonged to the abbey of Murbach, which gave it in fief to a noble family taking the name of Dornach.\nRenaissance\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, the de Dornach family died out. The sole heiress, V\u00e9r\u00e8ne, married Hertrich II Zu Rhein. The fiefdom of Dornach remained in the hands of the Zu Rheins until the French Revolution. The Thirty Years' War decimated the village, which fell from 200 inhabitants at the start of the conflict to 18 or 20 by the end of the war. When peace was signed, Dornach was repopulated.\nIn the 19th century\nThe Dollfus-Mieg factory in the 19th century.\nMulhouse's first industrialization soon had an impact on the village. It was in Dornach that the first steam engine was installed in 1812. Along the Steinbaechlein, textile factories set up shop: Blech-Fries, DollfusMieg et Cie, Hofer and Schlumberger, Thierry-Mieg au Brustlein. Louis Ren\u00e9 Villerm\u00e9 visits Dornach to write Tableau de l'\u00e9tat physique et moral des ouvriers employ\u00e9s dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie, published in 1840. In it, he describes the working conditions of workers in the commune's factories.\u201cIn Mulhouse, in Dornach, work started at five in the morning and finished at five in the evening, summer and winter alike.  You have to see them arriving in town every morning and leaving every evening.

    "A series of projects to prevent the flooding of the Yellow River\nYellow River management , Yellow River governance or Yellow River engineering (Simplified Chinese: \u9ec4\u6cb3\u6cbb\u7406, Traditional Chinese: \u9ec3\u6cb3\u6cbb\u7406) involves constructing hydraulic engineering projects to prevent flood disasters caused by the Yellow River and to harness its water resources. The river, flowing through the Loess Plateau, has been notorious since ancient times for its high sediment content and its propensity to flood and change course. Simple construction of riverbanks to prevent flooding would lead to sediment accumulation, creating an elevated river in downstream areas.\nThe management of the Yellow River has been a perennial challenge for Chinese rulers throughout history. The flooding of the Yellow River often signifies large-scale displacement and dynastic changes. The saying \"a sage emerges when the Yellow River is clear (\u8056\u4eba\u51fa\u9ec3\u6cb3\u6e05) \" illustrates that effective management of the Yellow River is closely linked to the legitimacy, effectiveness, and stability of Chinese regimes.\nHistory\nLegend has it that the Xia dynasty was founded by Yu the Great, who organized efforts to control water. The origin of Chinese nation is closely tied to the management of the Yellow River.\nAfter Qin Shi Huang unified the Six States, he initiated large-scale hydraulic constructions, including dredging of the river channels. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han of Han, the renowned water management expert Zheng Guo expanded the scale of the projects, constructing the Zhengguo Canal, and systematized the management of the Yellow River even further.\nDuring the Sui dynasty and Tang dynasty periods, the focus of Yellow River management was on strengthening the levees and dredging the river channels.\nIn the Ming Dynasty, Pan Jixun employed the method of \"binding water to expel sand\" and integrated management of the Yellow and Huai Rivers.\nAfter the 1950s, the People's Republic of China started tree planting on the Loess Plateau to stabilize the sand and built reservoirs such as the Xiaolangdi Dam. By using annual concentrated flood discharge and sediment transport management, they aimed to deepen the downstream riverbed of the Yellow River for long-term management.\n",

It was named after the King of Prussia, Frederick the Great. The plant processed ores from the Royal Fryderyk Mine (German: K\u00f6nigliche Friedrichsgrube) in Bobrowniki \u015al\u0105skie (nowadays the Historic Silver Mine in Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry). It gave rise to a new settlement \u2013 Strzybnica (German: Friedrichsh\u00fctte) \u2013 built for the plant's workers. In 1922, it was taken over by the Second Polish Republic and hosted dignitaries such as Marshal J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski and President Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski. In 1937, after over 150 years of operation, the plant was closed. Soon after World War II, the area was taken over by the Strzybnica Metal Works, later renamed the Zamet Mechanical Works in Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry in 1976.\nLocation\nThe area of the former Fryderyk Smelting Works (formerly the Zamet Mechanical Works, currently Zamet Budowa Maszyn S.A.) is located in the north-western district of Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry \u2013 Strzybnica \u2013 between Zag\u00f3rska Street (part of National Road 11), Father Edward P\u0142onka Street (formerly Metalowc\u00f3w Street), Ko\u015bcielna Street, and \u2013 until 22 December 2016 \u2013 Zametowska Street. Nearby runs railway line No. 144, which connects Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry station with Opole G\u0142\u00f3wne station and until April 2018 had an industrial spur leading to the plant.\nHistory\nFrom 1786 to 1862\nThe silver and lead smelting plant at the site of the former Donnersmarcks' hammer mill in Piaseczna (German: Piassetzna) near Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry (German: Tarnowitz) was built by the Prussian government on the initiative of Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden in just six months in 1786. The construction was overseen by Johann Friedrich Wedding, brought to Silesia by Reden. Smelting of ore in two blast furnaces began on 27 September 1786, using water from the drainage canal of the Bo\u017ce Wspom\u00f3\u017c adit (German: Gotthelf), while the ore was supplied from the Royal Fryderyk Mine (German: K\u00f6nigliche Friedrichsgrube) in Bobrowniki \u015al\u0105skie. Initially, charcoal was used as fuel, which was gradually replaced with coke produced on-site from around 1790 to reduce production costs and achieve higher temperatures. In the 1830s, black coal was also introduced for flaming.\nDuring the initial period of operation, the smelter produced 32,384 kg of silver, 28,050 tons of lead, and 30,142 tons of lead monoxide.\nIn 1799, the smelter employed almost a hundred workers. By the end of this period, with the expansion of the plant to include 6 coke-fired furnaces and a blowing engine powered by a steam engine with a capacity of 16 horsepower (in 1858), employment increased to 180 people.\nFrom 1863 to 1886\nDuring the second stage of operation, the Fryderyk Smelting Works became independent. A royal smelting office (German: Kgl. H\u00fcttenamt zu Friedrichsh\u00fctte) was established there. Previously, it was supervised by the Royal Upper Silesian Mining Office in Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry.\nThe beginning of this period saw increased ore deliveries from the Royal Fryderyk Mine and smaller private mines. This necessitated the expansion of the plant and modernization of production technology. A new method of silvering lead was introduced, allowing for increased lead production at the expense of lead monoxide. Additionally, in 1868, a zinc distillation furnace was built, enabling the production of pure zinc from the slag produced during ore smelting. The number of furnaces increased to 11. From 1867 to 1886, lead production increased from 3,596 to 15,061 tons (319%), while lead monoxide production increased from 827 to 1,697 tons (105%).\nEmployment also increased during this period, with the number of employees fluctuating as follows:\nThe employees of the smelter were mainly residents of nearby villages such as Rybna, Stare Tarnowice, and Piaseczna, for whom 13 houses and a vocational school were built. This marked the beginning of a new town, which took its name directly from the smelter \u2013 Friedrichsh\u00fctte or Friedrichsh\u00fctte O.S., where O.S. stood for Oberschlesien \u2013 Upper Silesia. In 1886, the construction of an Evangelical-Augsburg church was completed, followed by a Catholic church a year later. Today, this area is a district",
    "Municipal building in Epping, Essex, England\nThe Old Town Hall is a former municipal building in the High Street in Epping, Essex, a town in England. The building, which briefly served as the headquarters of Epping Urban District Council, now accommodates a firm of estate agents.\nHistory\nIn the mid-19th century, a group of local businessmen decided to form a company, to be known as the Epping Town Hall Company, to finance and commission a town hall for the town. The new building was designed in the Italianate style, built in red brick at a cost of about \u00a31,700 and was completed in 1863. The site they selected was on the southeast side of the High Street.\nThe design involved a single-storey entrance block of three bays, facing onto the High Street, and a full-height main block with a gable stretching back behind the entrance block. The first two bays of the entrance block were fenestrated by segmental headed sash windows, while the right-hand bay featured a round-headed doorway flanked by a pair Doric order pilasters supporting an architrave and a keystone. Internally, the principal room was the main assembly hall, which could seat 500 people and was used for a variety of meetings, concerts, and other public events.\nAfter the Epping Union and Rural Sanitary Authority was succeeded by Epping Urban District Council in 1896, the council decided to use the town hall as its offices and meeting place.  However, the company that had developed the town hall got into financial difficulties and the council had to use temporary facilities for its meetings, before relocating to Hawthorn Lodge on the opposite side of the High Street.\nIn 1912, the building was sold for alternative use and was converted into the Picture House cinema, seating 419 people.  A large hoarding was erected on the roof of the entrance block advertising the latest film available for viewing. The company which had developed the town hall was then dissolved in May 1915. By the early 1920s, the cinema was part of the Shipman & King circuit, and in 1924 it was renamed the Picture Palace.  In 1935, it suffered a major fire, but was rebuilt and reopened the following year as the Empire Cinema.  The cinema closed in 1954, and the facade was rebuilt with a modern shopfront allowing the building to become a Tesco supermarket. The entrance building was occupied by a photography shop, \"The Portrait Studio\",  in the early 21st century, then by an education centre for young people known as \"The Box\" from around 2010, and then by a firm of estate agents, Mullucks, from about 2015. Offices were installed in the former assembly hall.\n",
    "\nThe Russian submarine Tyulen (Russian: \u0422\u044e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c, lit.\u2009'seal') was the third and last boat in the Morzh class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. It was laid down in August 1913 and was launched in November 1913, though it did not enter service until March 1915. Built for the Black Sea Fleet, it saw action during World War I and became the most successful Russian submarine in the Black Sea, credited with sinking over 40 ships for a total tonnage of 8,973\u00a0gross register tons\u00a0(GRT). It was also the second most successful Russian submarine in the war overall, after Volk.\nIn early 1915, Tyulen made several failed attempts to sink the German cruisers in the Black Sea, Goeben and Breslau. After that it focused on Ottoman merchant shipping, which transported coal to Constantinople from other parts of Anatolia, and sank many sailing ships and schooners. In July 1916 the submarine entered the Gulf of Varna to carry out reconnaissance on the Bulgarian naval base there, and in October, some of its crewmen boarded and captured a Turkish transport ship before bringing it back with them to Sevastopol. In May 1918, the German Army advanced into Crimea and took control of much of the Black Sea Fleet, including Tyulen. The British later acquired the submarine after Germany's surrender, and gave it to the White Army forces in September 1919. Tyulen was among Wrangel's fleet of ships that evacuated from Crimea in late 1920 during the Russian Civil War, and ended up in French Tunisia, where the submarine was eventually sold for scrap in 1930.\nDesign and construction\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Morzh-class boats and three Narval-class. The naval engineer Ivan Bubnov was the designer of the Morzh class and developed it from his earlier submarine Akula, which was considered to be the most advanced of the Russian submarines at the time. In the years before the 1911 program, there was debate in the Imperial Russian Navy on whether to purchase and build the submarines designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard, or a foreign inspired design, based on the popular Holland type, which became known as the Narval class. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class.\nThe Morzh-class submarines were well-armed for the time, and Tyulen differed from the others by having two deck guns instead of one, along with four internal torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars. However, the vessel had numerous shortcomings. It suffered from having only a single hull, lacking bulkheads, having a slow diving time of 3+1\u20442 minutes due to poor ballast tank venting, and a diving depth of only 25 fathoms (150\u00a0ft; 46\u00a0m). An additional problem was that twin 1,140-horsepower (850\u00a0kW) diesel engines to power all three Morzh-class boats had been ordered from Germany, but were not delivered by the time World War I broke out. They had to be replaced by severely underpowered engines from the Amur River gunboats, each of which delivered only 250 horsepower (190\u00a0kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30\u00a0km/h; 18\u00a0mph) surface speed could not be attained. The designed 12-knot (22\u00a0km/h; 14\u00a0mph) underwater speed also could not be attained due to a poorly designed hull shape, which was more like that of a surface vessel than a submarine. The construction of all three Morzh-class boats began on 25 June 1911, and took place at the Nikolayev department of the Baltic Yard, which was specifically founded to build the Morzh class. In November 1913 Tyulen became the third and last of this class to be launched.\nThe engines and electric battery were installed in January 1915, with sea trials taking place until March 1915, which was when Tyulen entered service with the Imperial Black Sea Fleet. The Morzh-class boats were considered the best submarines in the Black Sea Fleet when they were completed.\nWorld War I service\n1915\nTyulen behind its sister ship Nerpa, next to a submarine tender\nWhen it joined the fleet, Tyulen was commanded by Senior Lieutenant Pyotr S.

He fought in the Austro-Turkish War in 1789\u20131790. He led an infantry regiment in 1792\u20131793 and was promoted Generalmajor at the beginning of 1794. He fought in the Flanders campaign in 1792\u20131794 and in the Rhine campaign of 1795. After being transferred to Italy, he led a brigade at Lonato, Rovereto, and Calliano in 1796. He was promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant in 1797 and led a division in 1800 at Engen, Messkirch, and the Iller River. In 1801 he became the inhaber (proprietor) of an infantry regiment. He died in 1806.\nEarly career\nJohann Rudolf von Sporck was born on 27 November 1755 in Prague. His noble parents were Johann Karl, Graf von Spork and Theresia Gr\u00e4fin von Th\u00fcrheim. His sisters were Maria Karolina Josefa von Clam-Gallas (1752\u20131799) and Maria Josefa (b. 1753). Johann Rudolf joined the army of the Habsburg monarchy at an early age. On 27 November 1787 he was promoted to Major and on 9 March 1789 he was promoted again to Oberstleutnant. In the war with Ottoman Turkey, he served with the 2nd Banat Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 11. On 24 July 1789, in an unnamed skirmish, he drove off a superior force of Turks by leading a flank attack. In May 1790, he led part of his regiment to the relief of the Lubina blockhouse, which was under assault by the Turks. At the end of the war, he transferred to the Brechainville Infantry Regiment Nr. 25.\nFighting the French\nIn 1792, Sporck became Oberst (colonel) in command of Grand Duke of Tuscany Infantry Regiment Nr. 23. He assumed command from Franz von Rottenburg and in 1794 would be succeeded by Anton B\u00fcrger. At the start of the War of the First Coalition the regiment was stationed in the Austrian Netherlands. On 23 April 1792, part of the regiment took part in a reconnaissance of Maubeuge. Two battalions of the regiment served during the Siege of Le Quesnoy from 28 August to 13 September 1793. On 1 January 1794, Sporck was promoted Generalmajor to rank from 17 December 1793. He fought at the Battle of Mouscron on 28\u201329 April 1794. In the aftermath of the Battle of Courtrai, at Ingelmunster on 12 May he led a brigade consisting of two battalions of the Szt\u00e1ray Infantry Regiment Nr. 33, the 2nd Battalion of the Callenberg Infantry Regiment Nr. 54, and two guns.\nPeter Quasdanovich\nSporck served in the Army of the Upper Rhine during the Rhine campaign of 1795. In early 1796, he was among the troops transferred to Italy. On 29 July 1796, the Austrian army commander Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser launched the first relief of the Siege of Mantua. Of the four relieving columns, Spork was assigned to lead a brigade in the I Column of Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich. The other three brigades were led by Joseph Ocskay, Peter Ott, and Prince Reuss. The two advanced guards were led by the Marquis of Lusignan and Johann von Klenau. Quasdanovich's column counted 15,272 infantry, 2,349 cavalry, and 24 position guns. Klenau captured Brescia by surprise on 30 July and his troops were soon joined by the brigades of Sporck and Reuss. The Battle of Lonato was an intricate series of actions fought on the west side of Lake Garda over the next few days in which Napoleon Bonaparte's French army made its main effort against Quasdanovich's column while holding back the rest of Wurmser's army. On the night of 3 August, Quasdanovich decided to attack Sal\u00f2 but both Ott and Sporck argued against it on the grounds that their troops were low on ammunition and food. Reuss soon arrived with the news that Ocskay's brigade had been destroyed. Quasdanovich elected to withdraw from the area after hearing no news of Wurmser and seeing I Column reduced to only 10,000 troops.\nAt the end of August 1796, Wurmser reorganized his army for the second relief of Mantua. He appointed Paul Davidovich to lead a corps that would defend the Tyrol while Wurmser marched to Bassano via the Valsugana. Davidovich's corps numbered 19,555 men of which the brigades of Sporck and Josef Philipp Vukassovich counted 7,840 infantry and 626 cavalry. Unexpectedly, the French attacked these two brigades with overwhelming force in the Battle of Rovereto in the morning of 4 September, driving them back after a hard combat. Davidovich assigned the 1,700 men of Preiss Infantry Regiment Nr. 24 to hold a narrow defile north of Rovereto. Thinking that they were protected, the 4,800 remaining soldiers of Sporck and Vukassovich bivouacked and began to cook dinner. However, the French rapidly overran the Preiss Regiment and at 4:00 pm charged into the camp without warning, routing both brigades. By the next day, 75% of Sporck's men were casualties or dispersed and 1,000 of Vukassovich's soldiers were casualties.\nMap shows the opening moves of the Arcole campaign. Sporck helped plan the operation.\nJ\u00f3zsef Alvinczi was selected as the Austrian army commander for the third relief of Mantua. T",
    "\nReactions to the Israel\u2013Hamas war include significant geopolitical divisions emerged. Much of the Western world provided \"strong\" support to Israel militarily and diplomatically, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany although the strong support is \"at odds with the attitudes of Western publics which continue to shift away from Israel\", according to Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Lovatt says that during the Cold War, Israel sided with the West against the Arab countries supported by the Soviets, and Western leaders generally see Israel \"as a fellow member of the liberal democratic club\" and that this partially \"explains the continued strong Western support for Israel \u2013 which has now largely become reflexive\". In contrast, the Islamic world and much of the Global South denounced the actions of Israel and its allies, criticizing the \"moral authority of the West\" and alleging that it holds double standards surrounding human rights. The double standards, in their view, is condemning an illegal occupation in Ukraine while standing firmly behind Israel that has occupied Palestinian lands.\nThe United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have supplied Israel with substantial military and medical aid.\nIsrael\nMain article: Israeli government response to the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel\nSee also: Mass detentions in the Israel\u2013Hamas war\nVolunteers organizing deliveries for soldiers in Nesher\nSupport sign for the \"citizens of south\" and IDF soldiers at the policeperson roundabout in Ra'anana, October 2023\nA public opinion poll conducted on 23\u201328 October by the polling company iPanel in collaboration with Tel Aviv University found that 57.5% of Israeli Jews believed the IDF was using \"too little\" firepower in Gaza, while 36.6% thought the amount of firepower was \"appropriate\", 4.2% were not sure, and only 1.8% thought the IDF was using \"too much\" firepower. In contrast, 50.5% of Israeli Arabs believed that the IDF was using \"too much\" firepower in Gaza. According to a survey by the Israel Democracy Institute, only 10% of Israeli Jews would support a pause in the war in Gaza to allow an exchange of Israeli hostages. A public opinion poll conducted in December 2023 by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 87% of Jewish Israelis supported the war in Gaza. 75% of Jewish Israelis rejected the Biden administration's calls to change the IDF's strategy to one that \"reduces the heavy bombing of densely populated areas.\"\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Hebrew University on 7\u20139 December on the post-war handling of Gaza, 56% of Israelis opposed the annexation of Gaza with 33% in favor. When questioned on who should administer Gaza in the immediate post-war period, 23% supported a coalition of moderate Arab states, 22% Israeli military rule, 18% an international force, 18% Israeli annexation and 11% the Palestinian Authority. The Direct Polls survey found that 83% of Israelis supported encouraging the voluntary emigration of residents of the Gaza Strip. According to a poll published by the Israel Democracy Institute, 91% of Israeli Jews and 24% of Israeli Arabs believe that the IDF is making an effort to follow international law.\nIn an Israel Democracy Institute survey of 510 Israeli citizens in early February 2024, 68% of survey respondents supported preventing all international aid from entering Gaza.\nAround 170 Palestinian citizens of Israel were arrested for posts supporting Palestinians in Gaza, which featured quoting Quran verses, \"prayers for the people of Gaza, and political analysis of Israeli military operations\". Between 1 October and 1 November, the number of Palestinians held in administrative detention, without charge or trial, rose from 1,319 to 2,070. Prisoners have been subject to torture and at least four prisoners have died in Israeli custody. The ethics panel of the Knesset voted to suspend politician Ofer Cassif for 45 days over anti-Israel statements in interviews he made after the war broke out. Following a rally in support of Gaza in Haifa, police commissioner Kobi Shabtai threatened to send antiwar protesters to the Gaza Strip. As of 18 October 63 people have been arrested in Israel on suspicion of supporting or inciting \"terror\" since the start of the conflict, according to Israeli police.\nAmidst the escalating violence, Magen David Adom initiated a blood donation drive and the Education Ministry closed schools on 7 October, transitioning to online learning from 15 October.

    "\nFor the book by Alice Dreger, see Galileo's Middle Finger.\nGalileo's middle finger in its glass egg enclosure\nThe middle finger of Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei (1564\u20131642) was removed from his body posthumously. In 1737, 95 years after he died, his remains were transferred to a mausoleum at the Basilica di Santa Croce. Antiquarian Anton Francesco Gori, anatomist Antonio Cocchi, and Italian marquis Vincenzio Capponi removed the finger of Galileo's right hand as well as one of his vertebra, an index finger, a thumb, and a tooth.\nThe middle finger passed to Angelo Maria Bandini, who exhibited it at the Laurentian Library. In 1841, the finger was moved to the Tribune of Galileo at La Specola. It was transferred to the Institute and Museum of the History of Science in 1927. Galileo's middle finger is part of the collection of the Museo Galileo in Florence, Italy. The finger is encased in a gilded glass egg.\nBackground\nItalian astronomer Galileo Galilei died in 1642 and had stipulated in his will that his remains go to Basilica di Santa Croce, beside those of his father, Vincenzo Galilei. Authorities from the Catholic Church did not want him to be buried on consecrated grounds given his views on Copernican heliocentrism, which were considered heretical at the time. Cardinal Francesco Barberini addressed the matter, writing that people might be scandalized by his entombment in the mausoleum. Instead, his remains were placed in a small enclosure near the Chapel of Saints Cosimo and Damiano.\nIn 1688, Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani stipulated in his will that his fortune should be used to establish a mausoleum for Galileo. The mausoleum was not constructed until well after Viviani's death, delayed at first by the potential disapproval of the Catholic Church and later by the \"dillydallying\" of Viviani's nephew and heir, Abbot Jacopo Panzanini.\nRemoval from corpse\nNinety-five years after his death, on 12 March 1737, Galileo's remains were transferred from an unconsecrated box underneath the Santa Croce bell tower to a memorial tomb inside of the church, near Michelangelo's fingers and bones. In a ceremony resembling the transfer of a saintly relic, Galileo's remains were taken from his heretic's grave to the mausoleum of the Basilica di Santa Croce.\nThe botanist Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti was in attendance at the transfer and had brought a knife. Anatomist Antonio Cocchi, Italian marquis Vincenzio Capponi, and antiquarian Anton Francesco Gori used the knife to remove the middle finger from Galileo's corpse, along with his thumb, index finger, one of his teeth, and his fifth lumbar vertebra. The tooth, index finger and thumb were placed in a handblown glass base and remained with the Capponi family until the beginning of the 20th century. Tozzetti later wrote that Capponi's explanation for taking the two fingers as relics was \"because Galileo wrote so many beautiful things with them.\" The vertebra was donated to the University of Padua by Domenico Thiene in 1823.\nExhibition history\nThe middle finger was later acquired by Angelo Maria Bandini of the Laurentian Library where it was exhibited. In 1841, the finger was moved to the Tribune of Galileo at the Museum of Physics and Nature (now La Specola) along with Galileo's Medici-Lorraine instruments. In 1927, it was moved to the Institute and Museum of the History of Science (Museo di Storia della Scienza). The museum's inventory originally listed the finger as his left index finger, though University of Florence professor Francesco Leoncini added a footnote indicating that it was Galileo's right middle finger.\nDisplay case at Museo Galileo including the Galileo's middle and index fingers\nIt eventually came to be included in the collection of the Museo Galileo. The finger is encased in an egg-shaped glass display above a cylindrical marble base. The base includes a commemorative inscription by astronomer Tommaso Perelli. According to the museum, Galileo's middle finger \"exemplifies the celebration of Galileo as a hero and martyr of science\". The finger is displayed alongside the objective lens from Galileo's telescope.\nThe Latin inscription of Tommaso Perelli:\nLeipsana ne spernas digiti quo dextera coeli\nMensa vias nunquam visos mortalibus orbes\nMonstravit, parvo fragilis molimine vitri\nAusa prior facinus cui non Titania quondam\nSuffecit pubes congestis montibus altis\nNequidquam superas conata ascendere in arces.\nSpurn not the remains of the finger by which the right hand measured out paths of the sky, pointed to orbs never before seen by mortals; with the aid of a small pile of fragile glass first dared the deed to which Titania, in full vigor, on mountains heaped high, was once inadequate, having tried in vain to ascend into the loftiest heavens.\nThe tomb of Galileo, at the Basilica di Santa Croce contains the rest of his remains\nAmerican journalist Nino Lo Bello wrote in 1986 about his attempts to track down Galileo's finger in the 1960s. He reported being told ",
    "Phoenecian flute\nGingras (alternatively Gingri) was a type of flute used by the Phoenicians, particularly in their mourning rituals. Information about the gingras comes from second-century AD Greek rhetorician Athenaeus in his work \"The Deipnosophists,\" where he reports the accounts of Xenophon, Democleides, Corinna, Bacchylides, Antiphanes, Menander, Amphis, and Axionicus about the instrument and its sound.\nDescription and use\nDescribed by Xenophon as about a nine inches in length, the gingras was a wind instrument that produced a \"shrill and mournful tone\". According to Democleides, the name \"gingri\" is derived from the lamentations for Adonis, as the Phoenicians referred to their god as \" Adonis Gingres\".  Amphis describes the gingras as a new invention of the Phoenicians. The instrument is also mentioned, according to Atheneus, by fifth-century BC lyricists Corinna, Bacchylides, by the fourth-century BC poet Antiphanes in his work \"The Physician\", and by late fourth-century BC Athenian poets Menander in \"Karine,\" and Amphis in \"Dithyrambus\". The Gingras is believed to have been also used by the Carians in their lamentations.\nAncient sources\nAthenaeus reports the following ancient snippets that mention the gingras. In \"Phileuripides,\" Axionicus compares the love for the melodious strains of Euripides to an illness, stating that to those afflicted, every other music seems as shrill as the gingras and a mere misfortune.\nFor they are both so sick with love\nOf the melodious strains of soft Euripides,\nThat every other music seems to them\nShrill as the gingras and a mere misfortune.\n\u2014\u200aPhileuripides by Axionicus, in Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae 4.174, Translated by Charles Duke Yonge (1854)\nIn another passage from Dithyrambus by Amphis, a character says that he has acquired an excellent gingras, a new musical instrument. Although it has never been presented in any theater, he asserts that it is a luxury enjoyed at Athenian banquets. When asked why he doesn't introduce it to everyone, the character explains that he fears drawing too enthusiastic an audience, as they would disrupt everything with their applause.\n(A) And I have got that admirable gingras.\n(B) What is the gingras?\n(A) 'Tis a new invention\nOf our countrymen, which never yet\nHas been exhibited in any theatre,\nBut is a luxury of Athenian banquets.\n(B) Why then not introduce it to this people?\n(A) Because I think that I shall draw by lot\nSome most ambitious tribe; for well I know\nThey would disturb all things with their applause.\n\u2014\u200aDithyrambus by Amphis, in Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae 4.174, Translated by Charles Duke Yonge (1854)\nSee also\nNabla\u00a0\u2013 Musical instrument\nNotes\n^ According to another translation the Gingras tone is described as \"high-pitched and plaintive\".\n",
    "Historic building in West Burton, North Yorkshire, England\nThe house, in 2011\nSorrelsykes House is a historic building in West Burton, North Yorkshire, a village in England.  It is noted for the follies in its park.\nA manor house, named Sorysikes Meadow, was constructed on the site in the early 17th century.  It was demolished in the early 19th century, and a new country house was built.  It was altered in 1921, with the addition of a block at the rear, giving it a rectangular plan.  The building was later divided into four houses, and it was grade II listed in 1988.\nThe Pepper Pot\nThe house is built of stuccoed brick, with quoins, modillion gutter brackets, and a stone slate roof, hipped on the left.  There are two storeys, a partial basement and attics, and an east front of nine bays.  The middle three bays project under a pediment, and contain a doorway with an architrave and a cornice on consoles.  To the left is another doorway containing a fanlight with a chamfered quoined surround and a round-arched architrave.  The left bay contains a two-storey canted bay window, and most of the windows are sashes, with a variety of surrounds.  In the left return is a semicircular bay window.\nThe Rocket Ship\nIn the parkland around the house are four follies.  Their date of construction is uncertain, but they may have been built by four sisters of the Tennant family in the 1870s.  At the top of a scree slope is a sham ruin, originally resembling a castle, though it was damaged in a storm in 1992 and little survives.  It is said to have been constructed to hide earlier lead mine workings.  The other three follies are better preserved, and two are grade II listed.  The Pepper Pot is in stone and has a circular plan.  There are two stages, the lower stage slightly tapering, the upper stage concave, each with a projecting top course of stones, surmounted by a conical cap.  On the west side is a very small doorway.  The Rocket Ship is also built of stone, and has a base in the form of a cube with tapering diagonal buttresses.  On the west side is a narrow doorway with a blind oculus above, and at the top is flagged coping. The base is surmounted by a tapering circular obelisk containing two blind round-headed vents and with flagged capping.  The unlisted folly is a stone arch, sometimes described as a gateway, but too low to walk through.  The follies were restored in 1993.\nSee also\nListed buildings in Burton-cum-Walden\n",
    "\nRichard \"Rick\" Hill (born January 26, 1953) is an American actor, author, and former gridiron football player. He is perhaps best known for his appearances in several films from veteran producer Roger Corman, including playing the title role in two installments of his Deathstalker series. He also collaborated with controversial baseball figure Pete Rose on his autobiography.\nFootball career\nHill was a three-sport letterman for Perrysburg High in Perrysburg, Ohio. In football, he twice won MVP honors in the Northern Lakes League, and was also a league all-star in basketball. He was recruited by the Georgia Tech football program, but his career was plagued by injuries.\nBefore 1972, NCAA players were required to spend a year on a freshman team before graduating to the varsity team. Despite a slow start which he attributed to an ankle sprain, Hill led the so-called \"Baby Jackets\" in ground gains, in part because future College Hall of Famer Randy Rhino was moved to defense. Hill's sophomore year started slow again on a weak team, and he was redshirted partway into the season, although head coach Bill Fulcher called him \"probably as good a back as we have at Tech\".\nHill came out strong in the 1973\u201374 campaign and led the team with six touchdowns by early November, when he suffered a ligament tear that took him out of action for the rest of the schedule. Unsure if he would even be able to play until late into the pre-season, Hill took the field for the 1974\u201375 campaign but was quickly sidelined with a hamstring injury. He recovered and helped a rejuvenated Tech offense to several school records in the final stretch.\nHill was a Rhodes Scholarship nominee at Georgia Tech, from where he graduated in 1975 with a major in business. Thereafter, he briefly enrolled at Emory University to study law, before attempting to turn pro. Hill trained with the Detroit Lions of the NFL, but did not make the team. He signed a contract with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the CFL in the spring of 1976, but suffered a dislocated shoulder during the preseason and left training camp with no appearance on record in the regular season.\nFilm career\nHill's acting break came when he was scouted at a Los Angeles beach and offered the small part of a lifeguard in a production called One of a Kind.\nThe same setting begat a leading role in Beach Patrol, the 1979 pilot for a proposed Aaron Spelling series, although the show was not picked up.\nHill was able to capitalize on his athletic background to keep his career going: he played a college football star (albeit from Michigan) in Detour to Terror, an NBC telefilm starring and produced by O.J. Simpson, and had a recurring role as another football player on the daytime drama Days of Our Lives. He also guest-starred as a varsity football player on an episode of Charlie's Angels, another Spelling production. In 1981, he was cast in Today's FBI, a re-imagining of classic show The FBI, which ran for a single season on ABC. In the later stages of his career, Hill has occasionally worked as a director of episodic television.\nIn 1983, Hill made his theatrical debut in Deathstalker, which was part of a wave of heroic fantasy films that followed Conan The Barbarian. The film was profitable for Roger Corman's New World Pictures, and Hill subsequently starred in several action films for Corman (including the third Deathstalker sequel) and his associate Cirio Santiago. Hill also appeared in Warrior Queen, a film aping the Deathstalker template but made by another exploitation producer, Harry Alan Towers. In 1994, he played a secondary protagonist in the final installment of the Class of... series, Class of 1999 II. Around the same time, the actor made another push for a leading role with Immortal Soldier, an android film which he co-wrote and was to feature genre veterans Maria Conchita Alonso, Jeff Wincott, Robert Davi, Michael Ironside and Louise Fletcher. However the project, promoted by newcomers Hatch Entertainment, did not materialize.\nIn the 1980s, Hill was a member of the Hollywood All-Stars, a touring celebrity softball team raising money for various charitable causes.\nWriting career\nEarly in his entertainment career, Hill expressed an interest in writing, and was working on a spec script based on his college recruiting experience. A baseball fan, he wrote another about the life of Jim Eisenreich, who battled through Tourette syndrome to become a Major League player. After that one was optioned, his agent tried to pitch him as a writer for a planned biopic of Pete Rose, a fellow Ohioan with whom Hill had become acquainted at a 1986 celebrity softball game. While neither film projects panned out, Rose read the Eisenreich script and chose Hill to write a tell-all book about his life. In the resulting opus, My Prison Without Bars, Rose admitted to betting on MLB games for the first time, an accusation he had steadfastly denied before.\nSelected filmography\nNote: This Rick Hill is not to be confused with s",

    "1964 studio album by Jean Shepard\nLighthearted and Blue is a studio album by American country singer Jean Shepard. It was released in October 1964 by Capitol Records and was her fifth studio album. It was the first studio project released following the death of Shepard's husband in a plane crash in 1963. The album was a collection of 12 cover songs that was reviewed positively by both Billboard and AllMusic. It was her first album to make the US country chart as well.\nBackground, recording and content\nJean Shepard had first broke through into mainstream country music with a pair of singles with Ferlin Husky in 1953. As a solo artist, she broke through in 1955 with a pair of top ten singles. As the decade progressed, Shepard's commercial success waned, partially due to influx of rock and roll and the Nashville Sound crossover country style. In 1963, Shepard also lost her husband Hawkshaw Hawkins in a plane crash. Shepard considered abandoning her career altogether following the accident. Ultimately, she chose to refocus her priorities and continue her music career. Lighthearted and Blue was Shepard's first studio album following the accident.\nLighthearted and Blue was recorded at the Bradley Film and Recording Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Sessions for the project were held between August 1963 and January 1964. The project was produced by Marvin Hughes, Shepard's first album produced by him after ten years recording with Ken Nelson. The album was a collection of 12 tracks. It was theorized that the album's conceptual focus on sad material was due to Shepard's grief following the death of Hawkins. The 12 songs were all covers tunes from the country music field. This included Roger Miller's \"When Two Worlds Collide\", Lefty Frizzell's \"If You've Got the Money, I've Got the Time\" and Freddie Hart's \"Loose Talk\".\nRelease and critical reception\nLighthearted and Blue was released by Capitol Records in October 1964. It was Shepard's fifth studio album in her career and her first since 1962's Heartaches and Tears. It was distributed as a vinyl LP offered in both mono and stereo formats. Six tracks were featured on either side of the record. Lighthearted and Blue was among 20 LP albums that Capitol issued in the fall of 1964. Billboard gave the album a positive reception, calling it \"one of her finest\". \"Jean once again demonstrates in this album why is one of the best loved and most respected performers and consistent record sellers in the C&W field,\" they wrote. AllMusic rated the album three out of five stars, calling it her \"comeback album\". Lighthearted and Blue was Shepard's first album to make the US Billboard Top Country Albums chart. That year it reached the number 17 position and would be the start of a series of LP's to make the same chart.\nTrack listing\nChart performance\nRelease history\n",
    "Mexican footballer and manager\nDaniel D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n Castillo, better known as Pirelo (8 February 1910 \u2013 1 January 2006), was a Mexican footballer who played as a midfielder for Spanish club Celta de Vigo. He was also a manager.\nClub career\nDaniel D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n was born in Chihuahua City, Mexico, to Spanish parents, and when he was young, his family moved to Galicia, where he began playing football for Eiri\u00f1a CF\u00a0, with whom he played three seasons of the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n (1929\u201330, 1931\u201332, and 1932\u201333), and was the Galician amateur champion in 1932\u201333. His performances eventually drew the attention of Celta de Vigo, then in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, who signed him in 1933, thus becoming the first Mexican footballer in the club's history. In his first season at the club, he helped the team win the Galician Championship\u00a0. In total, D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n scored 8 goals in 30 games in two seasons for Celta before leaving in 1935, returning to Eiri\u00f1a CF. After the Spanish Civil War, Celta returned to the official competition, and in order to do so in the First Division, it was required the renewal of a squad that had been devastated by the war and the break. Among other signings, Celta carried out a series of negotiations with Eiri\u00f1a for the signing of several footballers, among whom was the Mexican Pirelo. In gratitude for the magnificent disposition of the Pontevedra team, Celta played a free match in their field, in which Pirelo occupied the midfielder position.\nD\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n thus made his La Liga debut in the first league match of the 1939\u201340 edition, which was also Celta's debut in the Spanish first division, which ended in a 3\u20132 loss to Zaragoza on 3 December 1939. In doing so, he became one of the first Mexican footballers to play in La Liga. In Celta's first year in the first team, Pirelo was practically undisputed, playing 19 games out of 22, at a time when substitutions did not exist. In the second campaign, he was also quite complete, but with the arrival of reinforcements, mainly the Canaries, he lost prominence, and in its last year (1941\u201342), he only played four games. In total, he played 62 matches for Celta, scoring 8 goals.\nManagerial career\nOn 23 April 1941, Pirelo had the honor of forming the Celta eleven that defeated Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a 8\u20130 in Balaidos in the second leg of the round of 32 of the 1941 Spanish Cup; Celta went on to reach the semifinals after beating Real Madrid in the round of 16 and Real Oviedo in the quarterfinals.

    "Spanish footballer and manager\nCiriaco Cuesta Sanz (16 March 1907), also known by his nickname Cuestita, was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. He is considered by some as the most important Segovian player in history.\nHe later worked as a manager.\nPlaying career\nCiriaco Cuesta was born in Sanchonu\u00f1o, Segovia, on 16 March 1907, and he began his football career at Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a in 1928, at the age of 21. While there, he stood out as a great striker, so he was signed by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 1929, for whom he played in the inaugural La Liga season in 1929. In its December 1929 issue, the illustrated magazine Gran Vida dedicated its cover to the \"football star\" from Segovia, and defined him as an \"admirable player, a master of possessing devilish mobility\". Since his emergence into the first division, everything has been praise for Cuesta \"despite his doll-like figure\", and the press of the time in general agreed in warning that with his presence, Atl\u00e9tico's game had \"more life, \"more union, more danger for the enemy.\" Cuesta was also described as a player \"with easy and quick dribbling in his actions and the ability to score goals\".\nAt the end of the 1929\u201330 season, however, the club's permanence in the First Division was in serious danger, since they needed a win in the final matchday to avoid relegation against the already crowned league champions Athletic Bilbao, and although Cuesta netted twice in the first half, they ultimately lost 4\u20133 and were relegated to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. He remained at Atl\u00e9tico for seven years until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, playing a total of 62 competitive matches, including 47 in the league and 15 in the Copa del Rey. By this alone, Cuesta is considered by some as the most important Segovian player in history.\nAfter his professional journey, Cuesta returned to Segovia to receive a tribute on 31 May 1936, in a match between Gimn\u00e1stico FC and Atl\u00e9tico in front of a large audience in the stands, which ended with a comfortable victory to Atl\u00e9tico (4\u20137) minimized in a second half because several red and white players change teams to balance the clash.\nManagerial career\nAfter the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, Cuesta played one season for Imperio CF, where he retired in 1940 and then made his debut as a coach later that same year. He also managed Gimn\u00e1stica Segoviana CF between 1947 and 1949.\n",
    "Spanish footballer (1890 \u2013 1986)\nFelipe Ferrer Carreras (5 April 1890 \u2013 1986) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Mallorca, Levante, and Valencia.\nPlaying career\nBorn in Palma de Mallorca in 1890, Ferrer was the first player from Alfonso XIII, current RCD Mallorca, who went on to play in the First Division. From the age of 8 to 16, he lived with his family in Argentina, so he trained as a footballer in the vacant lots of the city of Buenos Aires, popularly known as potreros. Upon his return to the Balearic Islands, he began playing as an inside left player for Alfonso XIII, always appearing in the lineups of the late 1920s like Felipe.\nA player with great technique and a powerful shot, he became champion of Mallorca at only 18 years of age and played in a national championship within the Catalan Group. In the 1933\u201334 season, he signed with Levante, where he spent two seasons before going to play in Asturias with Real Oviedo, in the First Division, with whom he played five official matches and scored two goals. Oviedo, which finished third after Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid, had a great team, with a forward line made up of Casuco, Gallart, L\u00e1ngara, Herrerita and Emil\u00edn in which it was almost impossible to find a place, but Ferrer still managed to achieve it five times, but he lacked continuity and the arrival of the Spanish Civil War definitively cut his career short.\nAfter the war, he returned to the island to play for Mallorca, and in 1939 he arrived at a Valencia team that had a dream squad. On some occasions he helped put together a luxury forward line with Epi, Vicente Asensi, Mundo, and Gorostiza, but he did not enjoy real opportunities. He only played one league game in two seasons. From Valencia he went on loan only for the Cup matches to Murcia, and later signed with M\u00e1laga in the 1941\u201342 season. After it ended, at the age of thirty, he returned to Mallorca, playing with Atl\u00e9tico Baleares and Poblense. Felipe Ferrer died in Argentina in 1986.\n",

    "\nRatho Farm Golf Links is an 18-hole golf course that was constructed on the Ratho Farm in Bothwell, Tasmania.\nHistory\nThe first game of golf in Tasmania, and among the earliest games of golf in Australia, was played in Bothwell. The course at the Ratho property was until recently thought to be the oldest golf course in Australia, which was thought to have been built in the mid-1850s. Jane Williams, daughter of Ratho's first owner Alexander Reid, wrote in 1890 that golf was first played in the area sometime before 1860: \"...it (golf) was introduced over 30 years ago by Mr. William Wood, brother of Mr. Dennistoun Wood, of Dennistoun, and that it flourished as long as the Scottish element prevailed in the Bothwell district, when through death and other changes golf ceased to be practised in Bothwell.\"\nAlexander Arthur Reid of Ratho, grandson of the above-mentioned Alexander Reid, wrote in 1930 that his father, Alexander Reid Jr., penned a letter written in the early 1860s stating that he was starting a golf club in Bothwell with 15 or 16 members. Arthur Alexander Reid also mentioned that he remembered the \"queer-shaped old clubs.\"\nThe newly opened links at Ratho were reported in The Tasmanian Mail in August 1911: \"Mr and Mrs. Reid gave a golf afternoon on the newly laid-out Ratho links, at Bothwell, on Saturday, when a handicap mixed foursomes for trophies given by the host and hostess was played... The new course is a really excellent one, the turf being naturally suitable for golf, and the grass greens are all wonderfully good. Every hole has its difficulties, and the spoiling nature of the course adds to its attractiveness. The length of the course (9 holes) is 2,551 yards.\nGolf in Australia started at Grose Farm in Sydney, with the first reliably documented match played in 1839 by A.B. Spark.\nBothwell is home to the Australian Golf Museum, housed in the sandstone former school house.\nSee also\nAustralia portal\nList of links golf courses\nList of oldest companies in Australia\n",

    "\nPowell's Creek shown on the Fry-Jefferson map (1752) between Jordan's Point and the  Maycox (Maycock) Plantation\nMaycock Plantation, also known as Maycock's Plantation and Maycox Plantation, among the first plantations on the south side of the James River in Prince George County, Virginia, was settled by Samuel Maycock about 1618 or 1619, during the early Colonial period of Virginia. The former plantation is now part of the James River National Wildlife Refuge, and is located off Flowerdew Hundred Road And James River Drive, Prince George, Virginia.\nBackground\nBefore Jamestown was colonized in 1607, Weyanoke people and earlier Native Americans lived in the area from about 8,000 B.C. in what is now the James River National Wildlife Refuge. Seven archaeological sites show habitation from the Early Archaic through the Late Woodland periods. Artifacts include stone tools, projectile points, and ceramics. There is evidence of an agricultural culture. Their land was usurped by the English colonists. After decades of conflicts, known as the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, the Weyanoke people left the area in 1644. A ferry was established by 1705 at Maycock's Point to cross the James River. Soon after, the local economy was based upon corn and tobacco crops. There had been a mill on Powell's Creek, which was damaged during the Civil War, after which it was restored and operated for a few decades. By the early 1900s, much of what is now the refuge was wooded.\nSamuel Maycock\nSamuel Maycock, born a gentleman, was a scholar of the University of Cambridge in England. In the Colony of Virginia, he sat on the Virginia Governor's Council. Maycock patented 1,700 acres for his plantation in 1618. He was working on the land on March 22, 1622, with Edward Lister and another man when they were massacred by Weyanoke people during the Indian massacre of 1622.\nHistorical marker for Pace's Paines in Surry County, Virginia, which stated how Richard Pace notified settlers of eminent attack of 1622\nAt the time, Maycock had an infant child named Sarah who survived the attack. There was not much work done on the plantation for several decades due to the threat of attack by Native Americans. In 1638, Sarah Maycock married George Pace, the son of Richard Pace. George, or his son Richard Pace II, is believed to have built the 17th-century house.\nIn 1970, an archaeological team led by Dr. Ben McCary and Dr. Norman Barka from College of William & Mary unearthed a foundation of a house built between 1640 and 1660. It is believed to have been a two-story house about 60 by 20 feet (18.3 by 6.1\u00a0m), with three rooms on each floor. Situated on a bluff, it was built upon a former Native American site of the Weyanoke people that overlooked the James River. It may have been destroyed in the Third Anglo-Powhatan War of 1644 or at another time by other means. Richard Pace lived at Maycock Plantation near Powells Creek in 1659.\nFurther information: History of Jamestown, Virginia (1607\u20131699)\nSubsequent owners\nGeorge Pace sold 800 to 900 acres in 1650 to Thomas Drew. Roger Drayton sold 250 acres to John Hamlin  in 1696, who sold the land to Thomas Ravenscroft in 1723.\nIn 1772, acreage of various sizes on a seat called Maycox was put up for sale by George M. Meade and John Ravenscroft. The land was good for wheat and Indian corn.\nDavid Meade and the revolution\nDavid Meade bought the plantation in 1774. The plantation's \"long, narrow terraced raised walks that offered excellent viewing platforms, formed circulation routes through the landscape, and made ideal venues for social promenade,\" built according to Fran\u00e7ois-Jean de Chastellux in residential settings, such as Vassall-Craigie-Longfellow House in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Maycock Plantation, in 18th-century America.\nDavid Meade Jr. (1744\u20131830) lived there with his wife Sarah Waters Meade, the daughter of Sarah (n\u00e9e Prentis, 1749\u20131829) and William Waters, sometime after 1774, where he \"dabbled in English-style garden design.\" Educated in England, he helped finance that American Revolution. Charles Cornwallis, commander of the British forces, crossed the James River in May 1781 and in August Anthony Wayne crossed the river near or at the plantation of 600 acres. Meade lived there until 1796, when he sold the plantation.\nCarter Bassett Harrison\nIn 1800, Carter Bassett Harrison settled in Prince George County, Virginia at Maycock Plantation (Maycox Plantation), along the James River. William Allen Harrison lived at Maycox Plantation. He died in 1824 and Carter Bassett Harrison inherited his father's plantation and 25 enslaved people according to William Allen Harrison's will dated May 22 of that year.\nCivil War\nIn 1864, Union General Ulysses S.

    "\nA reproduced photo of the event\nArrancada Heroica (English: Heroic Sprint) is the name used for the historic football match in S\u00e3o Paulo that marked, in 1942, the forced change of name of the Palestra It\u00e1lia club from Palestra It\u00e1lia to Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras. The fact begins with the pressure for the football club, of Italian origin, to change its name during the Second World War when Brazil, governed by then president Get\u00falio Vargas, declared war on the \"Axis\" countries (Germany, Italy and Japan) and aligned itself with the \"Allied\" countries (United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, and other countries). It ended with a 3\u20131 victory for Palmeiras in their first match under this name in a decisive game against S\u00e3o Paulo that won them the 1942 Campeonato Paulista title.\nHistory\nPalestra It\u00e1lia team champions in 1940 during the Second World War\nSecond World War\nDuring the Second World War, after maintaining a neutral position throughout the first three years of the conflict, in February 1942, Brazil broke diplomatic relations with the Axis countries, after the Germans and Italians began torpedoing Brazilian vessels in the Atlantic Ocean. This initiative was a sign of the position formalized months later, when Brazil joined the Allies and declared war on the Axis (Germany, Italy and Japan).\nBefore that, in the same year, an ordinance approved in March 1942, under decree number 4,166, determined that assets belonging to Germans, Italians and Japanese, both individuals and legal entities, could be confiscated and used by the Brazilian government for compensate for losses generated by countries in the war against Brazil. Another determination by the government of Get\u00falio Vargas was carried out through a decree that prohibited any entity from using names related to Axis countries, under penalty of loss of assets.\nWith increasing pressure, several clubs linked to the axis were forced to change their names. The most emblematic cases are: Palestra Italia (Italian origin), Deutsch Sportive and Sport Club Germ\u00e2nia (both were of German origin) in S\u00e3o Paulo. And Palestra Italia in Belo Horizonte (from the Italian colony) was also forced to change its name, giving rise to Cruzeiro, in Minas Gerais.\nName change\nIn March 1942, trying to avoid complications, the S\u00e3o Paulo-based Palestra It\u00e1lia decided to change the name to Palestra de S\u00e3o Paulo. Another change was made to the institutional shield, which gained a more nationalist adaptation, with the removal of the color red and the addition of a yellow tone, in reference to the colors of the Brazilian flag.\nThe changes were not enough, as the political pressures of the time were immense. For some sectors of society, despite the word \u201clecture\u201d having Greek origins, it referred to Italy. Therefore, the demands for name changes and punishments were increasing. Leaders of the then Palestra still accuse S\u00e3o Paulo Futebol Clube as one of the opponents responsible for the greatest pressure in political circles, since, according to them, there was interest from the rival in the Estadio Parque Antartica. In S\u00e3o Paulo, the thesis about the stadium is considered to be a \"fantasy\".\nOn the night of September 14, 1942, the Palestra board met in an extraordinary session to discuss the demand for a total change of name. After hours of discussion and resistance, and the suggestion of names such as Piratininga and Paulista, it was finally decided on Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, partly due to the preservation of the letter P on the club's shields and symbols, and partly in honor of the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Atl\u00e9tica das Palmeiras, a club that was then extinct but which always maintained an excellent relationship with Palestra It\u00e1lia, having provided decisive support on several occasions of disputes with S\u00e3o Paulo football directors.\nThe meeting that brought the definitive name change from Palestra to Palmeiras was held days before the decisive game that could have won the 1942 Campeonato Paulista.\nThe Arrancada Heroica\nThe match took place on September 20, 1942, Palmeiras entered the field for the first time with the name that is still known today. In order to avoid the \"boos\" that were promised by their rivals, the team appeared on the Pacaembu Stadium lawn with a Brazilian flag, carried by the then 2nd vice-president of the club, Adalberto Mendes, who was captain of the Brazilian Army. The initiative and the moving image, later called Arrancada Heroica, was applauded by the fans present and helped to ease the pressure on the alviverde team.\nThe game with S\u00e3o Paulo was tense and violent, with Palmeiras winning 3\u20131, and the Tricolores refusing to play the rest of the second half, an act done as a form of response and protest against refereeing, when the referee awarded a penalty committed by Virg\u00edlio in Og Moreira. With the score and the S\u00e3o Paulino protest, Palmeiras won the first cup with the new name. With the defeat, S\u00e3o Paulo finished third, behind Corinthians, runner-up.\nSee ",
    "Species of lichen\nPeltigera isidiophora is a species of foliose lichen in the family Peltigeraceae. It is characterised by its laminal clustered isidia that grow in pits, a shiny and scarred grey upper surface, and its thin, sparse, and simple rhizines. It is known only from its original collection location in Hebei, China, where it grows on moss and on soil in montane forest.\nTaxonomy\nPeltigera isidiophora was described as a new species in 2015 by lichenologists Liu-Fu Han and Shou-Yu Guo. The type specimen of the species was collected in China, within Hebei Province on Xiaowutai Mountain. This specimen, designated as the holotype, was gathered from the ground at an elevation of 1,850\u00a0m (6,070\u00a0ft). The collection was conducted on 11 August 2013 by researchers Shou-Yu Guo, Liu-Fu Han, and Wen-Xia Liu. It is preserved in the herbarium of the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The species epithet isidiophora derives from the Greek isidion, meaning small granules, referring to the isidia on the lichen's surface.\nDescription\nThe lichen features a foliose, thin, and fragile thallus, forming roughly circular patches about 6\u201310\u00a0cm (2.4\u20133.9\u00a0in) in diameter. The lobes are flattened, elongate, 1.0\u20132.8 cm wide, and can extend up to 8.0\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in) long, often with a dichotomous branching pattern. The upper surface is typically pale grey to dark grey, turning to blackish grey when wet, and displays a characteristic pattern of clustered isidia along its surface, particularly on damaged or older parts.\nThe apothecia (fruiting bodies), which are rare and develop at the tips of the lobes, have an erect, saddle-shaped form, measuring up to 4.0\u00a0mm (1\u20448\u00a0in) in diameter. The margins of these reproductive structures range from smooth to crenulate. The colour of the apothecial discs shifts from red-brown when wet to dark brown when dry, and they have smooth, somewhat shiny surfaces. The paraphyses are simple and septate, with a thickening at the tips. The asci are clavate (club-shaped), ranging from 45.0 to 75.0 by 6.0 to 12.0\u00a0micrometres (\u03bcm), and typically contain eight spores. These ascospores are acicular and variably septate, measuring between 30.0 and 60.0 by 2.5 to 5.0\u00a0\u03bcm. Pycnidia, an asexual reproductive structure, have not been observed to occur in this species.\nHabitat and distribution\nPeltigera isidiophora grows on moss or soil within temperate forests dominated by species such as Betula platyphylla and Populus davidiana. At the time of its original publication, it was known only from its type locality on Xiaowutai Mountain in Hebei Province, China, at an elevation of 1850 m.\nThis species typically coexists with other Peltigera species and members of the genus Cladonia. It is one of 27 species of Peltigera that occur in China.\n",

    "The Pakistan wheat import scandal refers to a controversy that emerged in 2024, involving the importation of a significant amount of wheat by the caretaker government, despite the country having surplus wheat stocks. This decision allegedly caused a loss of more than 300 billion rupees to the national exchequer. The import of wheat was continued in the first two months of the Shehbaz Sharif government, as 778,000 metric tons worth of wheat, costing $231.32 million continued to be imported.\nBackground\nA summary of one million tonnes of wheat imports for strategic reserves was prepared during the caretaker government. However, in reality 2.778 thousand tons of wheat was ordered. The importation took place from September 2023 to March 2024. The decision to import wheat was taken during the previous caretaker government, and continued after the PML-N government assumed power.\nImpact on farmers\nWheat imports led to a glut of wheat in the market, causing prices to fall and farmers to struggle to sell their produce at a reasonable price. Farmers were getting Rs 2,800 to Rs 3,000 for 40 kg of wheat while a support price of Rs 39,005 was promised. Due to this crisis, farmers resorted to protests in Lahore and many other Pakistani cities.\nNationwide protests\nIn response to the wheat crisis, the Kissan Ittehad Pakistan announced that thousands of farmers would participate in nationwide protests beginning May 10. The protest is aimed at the government's inability to purchase harvested wheat at the announced minimum support price of Rs 3,900 per millet. 40 kg.\nInvestigation and accountability\nAn inquiry committee was set up to investigate the scandal and determine responsibility. The committee began interviewing officials to identify those responsible for allowing imports of wheat due to the expected shortage. The preliminary report of the investigation has revealed that federal agencies are responsible for the unnecessary importation of wheat. The complete report was submitted to the government in three days.\nShehbaz Sharif directed the suspension of the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (PASCO) Managing Director (MD) and General Manager (GM) Procurement due to \"negligence and non-compliance with the PM\u2019s instructions regarding the use of technology in the wheat procurement process,\" ordering third party audit of PASCO stock and additional procurement of 0.4 million metric tons (MMT) of wheat \"transparently and efficiently.\" Shehbaz also suspended Secretary Food Security Muhammad Asif and appointed Muhammad Fakhar-e-Alam in his place.\nReactions\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the wheat scandal. He alleged that the federal government's inquiry committee appeared to be an attempt to protect the big players involved in the scam.\nPakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Secretary General, Syed Nayyer Hussain Bukhari called for a NAB investigation on the scandal, stating \"The national treasury has incurred billions of rupees in losses due to the import of wheat, while farmers are on the streets despite bumper wheat production.\"\nPakistan Muslim League (N) Leader Nawaz Sharif summoned Shehbaz Sharif to Jati Umra to discuss the wheat scandal. In another meeting at Model Town he said that those involved in the \"wheat import scam should be taken to task,\" and supported accountability. Nawaz Sharif was given a briefing that said that claimed the Caretaker government was responsible for the wheat crisis. The current Punjab government also blamed the wheat import scandal on the previous care-taker administration.\nJamaat-i-Islami (JI) Party Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman on May 2 warned that his party would stage protests if the government \"persisted with its anti-farmer stance,\" called for the establishment of a judicial commission to investigate the scandal, urged the JI Kissan (farmer) chapter to liaise with farmer organizations and advocated for land reforms to distribute land among small farmers.\nFederation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Standing Committee on Agriculture on March 8 said that PASCO was operating in contradiction of the Prime Minister's directives through stopping wheat procurement and urged a third-party audit. Chaudhry Ahmad Jawad of the FPCCI further questioned the reason for importing wheat, the reducing of the procurement target, the delay in procuring, the sudden switch from written to online procedure and treatment of protesting farmers.\n",

    "Navajo weaver\nMabel Burnside Myers (1922\u20131987) was a Din\u00e9 weaver, herbalist and sheepherder. She is known for being the first Indigenous weaver to create dye charts for teaching students.\nLife\nBurnside Myers was born in 1922 in Pine Springs, Arizona into a family of weavers and silversmiths. She attended high school, graduating in 1938. At the Fort Wingate Vocational High School, she began to create a natural, plant-based dye book. She went on to become the head of the department of weaving at the Shiprock Vocational School, before reaching her 30th birthday.\nBurnside Myers had five children; she taught all of them about identifying plants to make dyes. Her daughter, Isabel Deschinny, is a well-known textile artist.\nWork\nBurnside Myers is known for creating complex work, such as two-faced blankets with a different design on each side. She would raise her own sheep, would forage for over 300 different plants to use for making dyes, card the wool and spin the yarn, dye the yarn, then set up the loom and weave.\nLike other Navajo weavers, she kept the complex patterns for her weavings in her memory, rather than referring to a written or drawn pattern.\nHer work has been exhibited nationally, and has been in exhibitions at the Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, and at the Arts & Crafts Guild, at Window Rock, Arizona.\nMabel Burnside Myers, Vegetal Dye Chart, c.1970\nBurnside Myers used vegetable dye materials in her work,  and is considered the first Indigenous weaver to invent dye charts from plant matter as guides to teach others about sources of dyes for use in weaving. Later, her dye charts were produced to sell on the tourist market. Each of her dye charts included a miniature woven textile on a miniature vertical frame loom, surrounded by pressed botanical specimens of plants, with each specimen identified with the name of the plant. Pieces of dyed yarn served as \"pointers\" to the various colors in the miniature weaving. The dye charts served as an \"index of place...an atlas\u2013a mental map\u2013of Navajo weaving worlds\" that provided a critical \"material record of indigenous ways of knowing the landscape and its natural colorants.\" Burnside Myers would travel extensively to exhibit her work teach others about weaving with plant-based dyes.\nBurnside Myers and her family were featured in the 1958 documentary film, The Navajo (Part 1):\"The Search for America\", directed by Dick Hatzel. In the film she presented an award-winning rug made with yarn dyed with 85 different plant-based colors. She has also been the subject of a film by Frank Cummings and Eileen Green. Burnside Myers and Green, an anthropologist, collaborated on a dye-recipe book.\nAwards and honors\nBurnside Myers won first place in the Navajo Tribal Fair in 1937. In 1939, she was invited to participate in the San Francisco Worlds Fair.\n",
    "2024 single by Randy Travis\n\"Where That Came From\" is a song written by Scotty Emerick and John Scott Sherrill and recorded by American country music singer Randy Travis. It was released on May 3, 2024, and served as Travis' first new recording of music in over a decade, developed through the use of artificial intelligence software to recreate his vocals following a series of strokes and health issues that left him unable to sing.\nBackground\nIn July 2013, Travis experienced difficulty breathing while working out at his home gym. He was hospitalized in Dallas, Texas for viral cardiomyopathy. While undergoing treatment, Travis suffered congestive heart failure and a stroke. The stroke affected the left side of Travis's brain, impacting movement on the right side of his body. Travis was placed on life support after the infection caused his lungs to collapse, and was declared to have a one percent chance of survival. The infection, subsequent stroke, and three separate bouts of pneumonia led to Travis undergoing three tracheostomies and two brain surgeries. Travis also suffered aphasia and lost the ability to speak and sing, while also suffering vision problems. These issues were mitigated through years of therapy with Davis, to whom he was engaged at the time. By November 2014, he was recovering, could walk short distances without assistance, and was re-learning to write and play guitar, according to Davis. While the stroke removed most of Travis's ability to sing, he has made sporadic onstage appearances to perform in limited capacity.\nIn 2023, the increased use of artificial intelligence spurred conversation about the need to protect artists' rights. However, Cris Lacy, Warner Music Nashville co-chair and co-president, believed that some positive influence could come from it in the way of \"giving Randy Travis his voice back\". \"Where That Came From\" is a ballad written by Scotty Emerick and John Scott Sherrill, and Travis' longtime producer Kyle Lehning developed the vocal track from an initial recording done by vocalist and frequent touring partner James Dupr\u00e9, working for months on perfecting it from the AI model's base rendering. They worked from two proprietary AI models that utilized vocal stems from Travis' career spanning from 1985 to 2013.\nReception\nSurrounded by friends and family, Travis reacted with a \"Cheshire grin\" when the finished product was played in the studio for the first time, and Travis' wife, Mary, was moved to tears, saying \"you forget how much you missed it until you hear it again\". Fellow country music artists and friends of Travis such as Carrie Underwood, Cole Swindell, and Clay Walker were among those invited to the studio to preview the song ahead of its release and reacted to it with \"a mix of joy and wonder\".\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Where That Came From\" premiered on May 6, 2024. It is composed of footage from the recording studio, documenting scenes from the process of the song's creation and of the reactions by Travis as well as his family and friends listening to the track for the first time.\nChart performance\n\"Where That Came From\" debuted at number 45 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart dated May 18, 2024, becoming Travis' first solo single to chart since \"Angels\" reached a peak of number 48 in 2005.\nCharts\n",

    "Species of lichen\nLecanora perpruinosa is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichen in the family Lecanoraceae. It occurs in Northern Europe, Estonia, Turkey, Russia, and Canada, where it grows on calcareous rocks.\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first scientifically described by Lars Fr\u00f6berg in his 1989 PhD dissertation. The type specimen was collected from a pavement in Sweden. However, the species is not considered to be validly published according to nomenclatural rules: although all of the requirements for valid publication were met by the author, he explicitly stated in his work that the new species was \"not formally described here\". In 2015, \u015aliwa, Zhao Xin, and Lumbsch proposed to transfer the taxon to the genus Myriolecis. This new combination is also not valid because the basionym upon which it is based is invalid. Despite the nomenclatural invalidity of the taxon, it continues to be referenced in lichenological literature.\nIn a molecular phylogenetics analysis, Lecanora perpruinosa was shown to occupy a sister group relationship with a clade of species referred to as the Lecanora dispersa group.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Lecanora perpruinosa is superficial, presenting an ash-grey colour. It is thin and displays either a cracked (rimose) or tiled (areolate) pattern, with an indistinct but mostly continuous edge. The apothecia (fruiting bodies) measure 0.3\u20130.8\u00a0mm in diameter. These structures are sessile, meaning they sit directly on the substrate without a stalk. The disc of the apothecia can appear black or near-black, or dark red to brown, and is heavily dusted with a bluish-white powdery coating called pruina. The edges of the apothecia are pronounced or level with the disc and share the same pruinose, colour-matching appearance as the thallus.\nThe cortex surrounding the apothecia is distinctly paraplechtenchymatous, indicating it is made up of densely interwoven hyphae, providing structural integrity. Unlike some other species in the genus, there are no granules in the epithecium (the uppermost layer of cells in the apothecia). The paraphyses (filamentous structures among the spores) are simple, thick, and bead-like (submoniliform). The ascospores of Lecanora perpruinosa are medium-sized, measuring between 10.5 and 12.0\u00a0\u03bcm in length and 5.0\u20137.5\u00a0\u03bcm in width. This lichen does not produce any secondary metabolites typically found in other lichens.\nHabitat and distribution\nIn addition to Sweden, the country of its original determination, its distribution in Northern Europe also includes Finland, Norway, and Denmark. It also occurs in Estonia, and Turkey. In Russia, it has been recorded from the Ryazan Oblast, the Komi Republic, and the Tver Oblast. In 2000, the lichen was reported growing on limestone cliffs within the Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Reserve in southern Ontario, Canada, marking its first record from North America.\nSee also\nList of Lecanora species\n",
    "The Tat alphabet is used for writing in the Tat language, which has two main dialects - the northern one, spoken by Mountain Jews, and the southern one,\nspoken by the Tats. During its existence, the Tat writing functioned primarily in the northern dialect and at the same time changed its graphic basis several times and was reformed several times. Currently, the writing of the Mountain Jews is in Cyrillic alphabets, and the writing of the Muslim Tats is in the Latin alphabet.\nThere are four stages in the history of Tat writing:\n1870s - 1928 - writing based on Hebrew alphabet.\n1928-1938 - writing based on the Latin alphabet.\nSince 1938 - writing based on the Cyrillic alphabet.\nSince the beginning of the 1990s, there have been attempts to create a written language on a Latin basis in Azerbaijan.\nHebrew alphabet\nMountain Jewish newspaper The Toiler (Judeo-Tat: \u0417\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0435\u0448) in Hebrew alphabet.\nThe first records of Judeo-Tat writing date back to the late 1870s and early 1880s, when Rabbi\nYaakov Yitzhaki compiled the first Tat book, \u201cThesaurus of Judeo-Tat (Juhuri) language of the\nMountain Jews of the Caucasus.\u201d This book used Hebrew writing, adapted to the needs of Tat phonetics. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Tat script on a Jewish graphic basis became more widely used - books began to be published in it, and in 1915 an attempt was made to publish a newspaper. In 1921, the first primer New School (Judeo-Tat: \u0422\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430) was published in this alphabet. In 1927, at the All-Union Conference on cultural work among the Mountain Jews, held in Moscow, it was decided to reflect in writing all the vowel sounds of the Judeo-Tat dialect (\u05d0 , \u05d0\u05b7 , \u05d0\u05b8 , \u05d9 , \u05d5 , \u05d5\u05bc ). However, at that time the process of transitioning the Tat language to the Latin script was beginning, which made the reform irrelevant.\nThe Judeo-Tat alphabet based on the Hebrew script looked like this:\nSoviet Latin alphabet\nIn the 1920s, the process of romanization of scripts was underway in the USSR. In May 1925, Y. Agarunov compiled the first draft of a Latinized alphabet for Mountain Jews. On May 15\u201320, 1926, at the regional congress of Mountain Jews in Nalchik, it was decided to transfer the Tat writing system to a Latin graphic basis. Since that time, preparatory work on Latinization began in the North Caucasus and Azerbaijan. In 1928, several projects for a new script were submitted to the committee for a new alphabet for consideration. Thus, the project of Z. Yu. Khudainatov included the following letters: \u0410 a, B \u0432, V v, G g, D d, H h, Z z, \u04e0 \u04e1, \u0127, I i, J j, K k, X x, L \u029f, M m, N n, S s, Y y, P p, F f, C c, \u00c7 \u00e7, \ua727, R r, \u015e \u015f, T t, O o, U u, \u00da \u00fa, E e.\nOn April 28\u201330, 1929, the All-Union Conference of representatives of the Mountain Jewish people were held in Baku. It finally approved the new alphabet for the Judeo-Tat language proposed by Boris Miller. It looked like this:\nMountain-Jewish newspaper \u201cCommunist\u201d in the Latin alphabet (1934)\nThis alphabet was actively used in the field of education, book publishing and the media. In\n1932, the first standard grammar of the Tat language was published.\nIn later editions in Latin, the letter \u0110 \u0111 is absent, but is present (only in borrowings) E e\nCyrillic alphabets\nThe question of the transition of the Judeo-Tat language to the Cyrillic alphabet was raised in 1937. The Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic instructed the Institute for the Study of National Cultures of Dagestan to develop this version of the letter. A new version of the alphabet was published on February 15, 1938, in the newspaper Dagestankaya Pravda; on July 1, all periodicals were translated into it, and on September 1, teaching the Cyrillic alphabet began in schools. Later, some changes were made to the alphabet (the letter \u0414\u0436 \u0434\u0436 was excluded. The letter \u0423\u04c0 \u0443\u04c0 was replaced by \u0423\u044c \u0443\u044c, and \u0425\u04c0 \u0445\u04c0 by \u0425\u044c \u0445\u044c). As a result, the alphabet began to look like this:\nIn the Azerbaijan SSR in 1938, the Judeo-Tat language was removed from all official spheres of activity - the publication of books, newspapers, and teaching in schools was stopped.\nTherefore, the alphabet adopted in the Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was not used in Azerbaijan. However, instead of it, a separate version of the Tat Cyrillic writing spontaneously arose, which was closer to the Cyrillic version of the Azerbaijani alphabet. At the\nend of the 20th - beginning of the 21st century, it also found some use among the Mountain Jewish who emigrated to Israel \u0410 \u0430, \u0411 \u0431, \u0412 \u0432, \u0413 \u0433, \u0414 \u0434, \u0415 \u0435, \u04b8 \u04b9, \u0417 \u0437, \u0418 \u0438, \u0419 \u0439, \u041a \u043a, \u049c \u049d, \u041b \u043b, \u041c \u043c, \u041d \u043d, \u041e \u043e, \u041f \u043f, \u0420 \u0440, \u0421 \u0441, \u0422 \u0442, \u04ba \u04bb, \u040b \u045b, \u0526\u2009\u0527, \u0423 \u0443, \u0424 \u0444, \u0425 \u0445, \u0427 \u0447, \u0428 \u0448, \u04d8 \u04d9, \u04ae \u04af. There are other versions of this alphabet, differing in the order of the letters and the replacement of the letter \u0418 \u0439 with \u0408 \u0458, as well as the presence of additional letters \u04f1, \u044b.\nModern Latin alphabet in Azerbaijan\nIn the 1990s, an alphabet based on Latin was created for the Muslim Tats of Azerbaijan.

    "\nCharles Clarence Childers was an American politician who served in the Oklahoma House of Representatives representing Garfield County and served three non-consecutive terms as the Oklahoma State Auditor, one term as Oklahoma Secretary of State, and one term on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.\nHe was first elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives between 1912 and 1916. He was the Oklahoma State Auditor from 1923 to 1927, 1935 to 1939, and 1943 to 1947. He also served as the Oklahoma Secretary of State between 1939 and 1943 and on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission between 1929 and 1933.\nEarly life, family, and education\nCharles Clarence Childers was born in Lawrence County, Arkansas, on September 1, 1872, to William Childers and Clara Wells. He attended public schools in Lawrence County before travelling to Memphis, Tennessee, for high school. He attended the University of Arkansas until 1893, leaving his junior year. Upon returning to Lawrence County he was hired by his father, the county sheriff and tax collector, as a clerk. On November 3, 1893, he married Elizabeth Wells. He and Elizabeth were members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.\nHe succeeded his father as sheriff and served two two-year terms. He then was elected county clerk for four years. In 1908, he moved to Oklahoma and settled near Billings.\nOklahoma politics\nHe served in the 4th and 5th Oklahoma Legislature representing Garfield County in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, winning election in 1912 and 1914.

    "Galaxy located in Bo\u00f6tes\nUGC 9684 is a barred spiral galaxy with a ring structure in the Bo\u00f6tes constellation. It is located 250 million light-years from the Solar System and has an approximate diameter of 90,000 light-years.\nThe luminosity class of UGC 9684 is I-II and it is classified as an active star-forming galaxy according to a study published in 2022, in which produces one solar mass of stars every few years, with levels of stellar formation.\nStudying of star formation rate for UGC 9684\nScientists who studied UGC 9684, have longed to find out the star-formation rate for UGC 9684. To do this, they used a Fitting and Assessment of Synthetic Templates code. The scientists used further observations via ultraviolet, both optical and near-infrared and from the luminosity measurements from different databases from GALEX, SDSS and from the final release of the MASS extended source catalog by Jarrett et al. 2000, with all the data retrieved from NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database.\nAs for the star formation, they employed a decreasing function of (SFR \u221d e\u2212t ) and also a delayed function (SFR \u221d t \u00d7 e\u2212t ) as well as the stellar population libraries written from Bruzual & Charlot and Convoy et al. Several metallicity estimates, published by Prieto et al. 2008, Kelly & Kirshner from 2012, whom the majority agreed, it is slightly above solar oxygen abundance 12+ log(O/H) \u2248 9.0 which corresponds to ~2 Z\u2299.\nScientists therefore found that the star-formation rate of UGC 9684 is 0.25\u20130.39 M\u2299 yr\u22121. Apart from that, they found the total stellar mass for the galaxy is M\u22c6 = (2.0\u20133.5) \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 which is a current specific of SFR sSFR \u2248 0.01 Gyr\u22121. This is higher compared to literature but compatible to large number of recent events in UGC 9684.\nSupernovae\nFour supernovae; SN 2006ed, SN 2012ib, AT 2017cgh and SN 2020pni, have been discovered in UGC 9684. This makes it as one of the most active supernova-producing galaxies.\nSN 2006ed\nSN 2006ed was discovered on September 18, 2006, via unfiltered CCD images, by N. Joubert, D. R. Madison, R. Mostardi, H. Khandrika and W. Li from University of California, Berkeley on behalf of Lick Observatory Supernova Search program (LOSS). SN 2006ed had a magnitude on 19.0.  It was located 1\".8 east and 7\".2 south of the nucleus. This supernova was Type II.\nSN 2012ib\nSN 2012ib was discovered on December 20, 2012, by amateur astronomer, V. Shumkov from Sternberg Astronomical Institute (SAI), on four 60-sec unfiltered images from the MASTER-Amur robotic telescope via a 0.40-m f/2.5 reflector. The supernova was located at 48\".7 east and 0\".4 south of the nucleus, which it had a magnitude of 18.9. The supernova was Type Ib/c.\nAT 2017cgh\nAT 2017cgh was discovered on March 15, 2017, by Pan-STARRS1 Science consortium. It was located 0\".0 east and 0\".0 north of the nucleus with a magnitude of 17.7.  This supernova had an unknown type.\nSN 2020pni\nSN 2020pni was discovered on July 16, 2020, by a team of astronomers on behalf of the ALeRCE broker via r-ZTF filters which was taken by a Palomar 1.2m Oachin telescope. It was located 5\".7 west and 5\".0 south of the nucleus with a magnitude of 17.0. The supernova was Type II in which its progenitor, a massive star, was enriched in helium and nitrogen in relative abundances in mass fractions of 0.30\u20130.40 and 8.2 \u00d7 10\u22123, respectively.\nA first study shows 1 day after the discovery, there is a significant He II emission which has strong flash features.  Another study shows during the 4 days after, there was an increase in velocity of hydrogen lines (from \u223c250 to \u223c1000 km s\u22121) suggesting complex circumstellar medium  (CSM).  A presence of dense and confined CSM as well as its inhomogeneous structure, indicates a phrase of enhanced mass loss of the SN 2020pni progenitor a year before the explosion. As of 2023, the supernova has since faded from view.\n",
    "6th episode of the 4th season of The Ren & Stimpy Show\nPrehistoric Stimpy is the sixth episode  of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 5 November 1994.\nPlot\nRen and Stimpy visit the Museum of Natural History where Wilbur Cobb is the guide who gives a confused, rambling and mostly inaccurate account of prehistoric life. Cobb states that life on earth  began as single-celled amoebas and the story goes back in time hundreds of millions of years into the distant past where amoebas lived in the sea. One amoeba that resembles Stimpy annoys an amoeba that resembles Ren, causing the Ren amoeba to slap the Stimpy amoeba, which then divides into new amoebas. In the present, Cobb then moves forward in time to the age of the Stimpyfish, which crawled out of the ocean onto land, only to fall into a tar pit while another Stimpyfish crawls out of the ocean to avoid the tar pit and instead is run over by a bus. Ren dismisses this story until Cobb shows him a prehistoric bus. Cobb then moves forward in time to speak of the Stimpysaurus, the \"stupidest creature of all time\", a dinosaur that resembles Stimpy which he is shown to be of very low intelligence as it slapped around by a dinosaur that resembles Ren. In the present, Stimpy asks Cobb how the dinosaurs went extinct and receives baffling bizarre answers in response such as the dinosaurs went extinct because they watched too much television. Cobb is arrested as he is revealed not to be a museum guide and as he is carried away shouts \"I killed the dinosaurs!\".  Ren and Stimpy prove their low intelligence by walking into a tar pit that is part of an exhibit and both drown.\nCast\nRen-voice of Billy West\nWilbur Cobb-voice of Jack Carter\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nProduction\nThe episode was illustrated by the Mr. Big Cartoons studio of Sydney. The cartoon was largely created by the showrunner, Bob Camp, who felt sorry for the financially distressed actor Jack Carter, and Prehistoric Stimpy was intended to be a showcase of Carter's vocal talents that would also give him some needed money. The scene where Stimpy rips off pieces of Cobb's face was censored by the network.\nReception\nThe American critic Thad Komorowski wrote that the episode was one of the stronger episodes that featured the recurring Wilbur Cobb character.\nBooks and articles\nDobbs, G.

    "Historic building in California, United States\nUnited States historic place\nThe American Cash Apartments/American Cash Store located in Sacramento, California is a historic apartment building designed in the Commercial Style architecture style, located two blocks northwest of the California State Capitol building. Designed by George C. Sellon, the first state architect of California who designed many notable buildings during the first half of the 20th century.\nHistory\nAfter its completion, the  second and third floors had a total of twenty-four apartments. Orlando F. Washburn had hired Sellon to design the building that would house his retail operation, American Cash Store, which had outgrown its original location at the corner of Eighth and K Streets. After moving into the new location, The American Cash Store had 67 employees and 17 delivery wagons, and its departments included grocery, delicatessen, bakery, and hardware. The business suffered an interior fire in the early morning hours of November 7, 1909, not long after the building was completed, and the American Cash Store had to temporarily relocate. The fire started in the basement, and caused $65,000 worth of damage. The building was quickly repaired and opened back in February 1910. The American Cash Apartments appealed to middle class renters and some legislators kept apartments in the building, including Secretary of the Senate Walter N. Parrish of Stockton and Senator Henry H. Lyon in 1911, and William J. Ferguson of San Francisco in 1921.\nIn the 1920s, the American Cash Store was affiliated with a meat dealers\u2019 union that actively worked to suppress Asian-owned markets and fuel anti-Japanese sentiment, and advertised itself as a butcher shop run by American citizens, despite its proximity to Sacramento's West End Japantown. The American Cash Store had closed by the end of the 1920s and subsequent stores include a butcher shop ran by W.J. Atkinson, a grocery store ran by H. King, and Muzio French & Italian Bakery occupied the third storefront. During the 1930s a hat cleaner and a business called \u201cSanitarium System of Baths\u201d moved into the building. The corner at 1117 8th St. had housed restaurants and bars since the early 1930s, starting with a Chinese American restaurant called Dragon Caf\u00e9. Subsequently, the corner unit was home to a sandwich shop and bar called Prosperity Corner, which featured live music and strip-tease acts.\nIn 1937, the building's name was changed to the Bel-Vue Apartments. Around this time, the Spillman-Callister Real Estate Company acquired the building and perhaps changed the name to signal new ownership.  The Spillman-Callister Company invested in upgrades, such as Steam heat and refrigeration and advertised them heavily.\n",

    "American naval pilot\nPatricia L. \"Trish\" Beckman is an American retired naval pilot, one of only five since World War II to be selected as a Naval Flight Officer.\nEarly life\nPatricia L. \"Trish\" Beckman was born in Huntsville, Alabama, to William and Betty Beckman, and was the oldest of seven children; Beckman's father was a Korean War veteran in the Army. She was raised in Alabama until she graduated from Lee High School in 1970. Her early interest in aviation was partially because the Saturn V rocket was partly built in Huntsville during the space race with the Soviet Union. After graduating high school, Beckman enlisted in the United States Navy.\nMilitary career\nEarly enlistment\nBeckman enlisted in the US Navy in 1970 during the Vietnam War era. During her first eight years of enlistment, she maintained and operated flight simulators and gained higher education while serving under the Naval Enlisted Scientific Education Program. She earned a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from 1974 to 1978 at North Carolina State University and a master's degree in aeronautical engineering in 1988 from the Naval Postgraduate School. She was involved in NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) from 1978 to 1981 as a fleet support and liaison officer in Dahlgren, Virginia.\nPilot\nIn 1980, Beckman became one of only five women since World War II to be selected as a Naval Flight Officer, and in 1982 earned her wings as a pilot. She is a part of the first batch of women to graduate from the US Naval Test Pilot School and later became an instructor at the academy. She is the first-ever American woman to qualify to crew the F-15E and its variants and the first to qualify to crew the F/A-18 and its variants. In her military career, Beckman piloted 67 different types of aircraft and in 1999 \u00a0retired as a commander, serving 28 years.\nHer service in the Navy during the Vietnam War and the complex public perceptions of veterans who served during that period of US history have stuck with Beckman during her career and retirement. Beckman believes that veterans are treated with more respect now than some of her fellow veterans received when returning from the war.\nIn 1991, Beckman participated in an effort to lobby the US Congress in favor of repealing exclusionary laws that prevented women from partaking in combat roles in the military. She is credited as being a part of that successful effort.\nTime at Boeing\nAfter she retired from the Navy in 1999, Beckman continued her education by earning a second master's degree in business administration at Webster University in 2002. That same year she became certified by the Federal Aviation Administration as a flight navigator and aircraft dispatcher.\nBeckman was then employed by Boeing as a test pilot for their civilian aircraft program and flew as a Systems Operator for production and engineering test flights for the Boeing 737. She also functioned as a Flight Test Navigator for ferry flights and engineered test flights for most Boeing aircraft (737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787), clocking in over 6000 hours of flight time for 73 different types of aircraft.\nIn 2013 she became a contributor to support Boeing Test & Evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base for military aircraft.\nImpact\nBeckman has contributed to and founded various organizations whose mission is to celebrate, educate, and empower women in the aviation industry. She was the president of Women Military Aviators Inc. (WMA), a founding board member of Women in Aviation International (WAI), and inducted into the Pioneer Hall of Fame in 2010.\nBeckman now resides in Seattle, Washington. She uses her life story to inspire and motivate young people to pursue a career in STEM and aviation. Trish is a workshop presenter for the Sally Ride Science Festivals in various places around the US and a contributor to several aerospace museums.\n",
    "Royal Navy S class destroyer\nHMS Stonehenge was an Admiralty S-class destroyer that served with the Royal Navy during the twentieth century. The S class was a development of the R class created during the First World War as a cheaper alternative to the V and W class. Launched after Armistice that ended the war, the ship was commissioned in 1919 and joined the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla. The vessel supported the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and then British forces assisting the partition of the Ottoman Empire, being based at Constantinople in 1920. In that year, the destroyer ran aground off the coast of Smyrna while on a routine mission. Despite attempts by sister ship Serapis to refloat the stricken vessel, Stonehenge had to be abandoned, although no one died in the accident. The remains were sold in 1921.\nDesign and development\nMain article: S-class destroyer\nStonehenge was one of 33 Admiralty S-class destroyers ordered by the British Admiralty on 7 April 1917 during the First World War as part of the Eleventh War Construction Programme. The design was a development of the R class introduced at the same time as, and as a cheaper and faster alternative to, the V and W class. Differences with the R class were minor, such as having the searchlight moved aft and being designed to mount an additional pair of torpedo tubes.\nThe destroyer had a overall length of 276\u00a0ft (84.1\u00a0m) and a length of 265\u00a0ft (80.8\u00a0m) between perpendiculars. Beam was 26\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (8.1\u00a0m) and mean draught 9\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (3\u00a0m). Displacement was 1,075 long tons (1,092\u00a0t) normal and 1,221 long tons (1,241\u00a0t) deep load. Three Yarrow boilers fed steam to two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines rated at 27,000 shaft horsepower (20,000\u00a0kW) and driving two shafts, giving a design speed of 36 knots (67\u00a0km/h; 41\u00a0mph) at normal loading and 32.5 knots (60.2\u00a0km/h; 37.4\u00a0mph) at deep load. Two funnels were fitted. A full load of 301 long tons (306\u00a0t) of fuel oil was carried, which gave a design range of 2,750 nautical miles (5,090\u00a0km; 3,160\u00a0mi) at 15 knots (28\u00a0km/h; 17\u00a0mph). The ship had a complement of 90 officers and ratings.\nArmament consisted of three QF 4\u00a0in (102\u00a0mm) Mk IV guns on the ship's centreline. One was mounted raised on the forecastle, one on a platform between the funnels, and one aft. The destroyer mounted a single 2-pounder 40\u00a0mm (1.6\u00a0in) \"pom-pom\" anti-aircraft gun for air defence. Four 21\u00a0in (533\u00a0mm) torpedo tubes were carried in two twin rotating mounts aft. Four depth charge chutes were also fitted aft. Initially, typically ten depth charges were carried. The ship was designed to mount two additional 18\u00a0in (457\u00a0mm) torpedo tubes either side of the superstructure but this required the forecastle plating to be cut away, causing excess water to come aboard at sea, so they were not carried. The weight saved enabled the heavier Mark V 21-inch torpedo to be carried. Fire control included a training-only director, single Dumaresq and a Vickers range clock.\nConstruction and career\nLaid down by Palmers at their dockyard in Jarrow, Stonehenge, the first Royal Navy ship to be given the name, was launched on 19 March 1919 after the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the war. The vessel was commissioned on 14 August 1919, joining the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla as a tender to the depot ship Hecla. The ship was transferred to Chatham to replace the R-class destroyer Tempest and was completed to full crew on 11 October. The vessel briefly served in the British campaign in the Baltic as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, but returned to Chatham on 1 April 1920.\nOn 20 August 1920, the Treaty of S\u00e8vres was signed between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies agreeing the partition of the Ottoman Empire. However, to enforce the terms required military intervention in the region. The Royal Navy had been in military occupation of Constantinople since 16 March. Stonehenge was detached from the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla and joined the deployment, serving in the Mediterranean Sea. On 31 October, the destroyer sailed from Constantinople to Mudros on a routine mission, to collect mail and ratings. However, off the coast of Smyrna, the vessel encountered very strong rain that reduced visibility and ran aground. The crew fired rockets to attract attention and were rescued by sister ship Serapis, which also attempted to refloat the destroyer. This was unsuccessful and Stonehenge was abandoned on 6 November. The wreck was sold on 26 March 1921.\nPennant numbers\n",

    "\nThere are many nicknames for the city of Indianapolis, the largest city in Indiana and 17th-largest city in the United States. The city's nicknames reflect its geography, economy, multicultural population, and popular culture, including sports and music. They are often used by the media and in popular culture to reference the city.\nThe city does not have an official nickname. However, it has adopted an official slogan, the \"Crossroads of America\", which is also the official state motto of Indiana. The city's most popular unofficial nickname is \"Indy\", an abbreviation capturing the first two syllables of Indianapolis.\nPopular nicknames\n317\nEstablished in 1947, 317 is the area code for the Indianapolis area.\nCircle City\nMonument Circle in 1907\nThe \"Circle City\" nickname originates from the distinctive 1821 plan of Indianapolis by Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham. The plan's focal point on a traffic circle Monument Circle (originally, Governor's Circle) is the traffic circle and focal point of the Mile Square plan of Indianapolis. Since 1902, Monument Circle has been home to the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Monument.\nCrossroads of America\nA state quarter with the Crossroads of America on it representing Indiana\n\"Crossroads of America\" was first used in reference to numerous railroads that intersected Indianapolis in the late 19th century. In the 20th century, the moniker evolved to reference the city's proximity to important highways. First adopted in 1937 as the state of Indiana's official state motto, it was later adopted as the city's official slogan in 1988.\nIND\n\"IND\" is the IATA airport code for Indianapolis International Airport and the Amtrak station code for Indianapolis Union Station. It is also used by scoreboard and/or statistics line abbreviations for sports franchises based in Indianapolis.\nIndy\n\"I Am Indy\" sculpture photo op at Indianapolis Motor Speedway during festivities for the Solar eclipse of April 8, 2024\nAn abbreviation capturing the first two syllables of IN-dee-\u0259-NAP-\u0259-lis, \"Indy\" is the city's most widely used nickname, commonly reflected in the names of public agencies (e.g., Indy Parks and IndyGo), events (e.g., Indy Film Fest and Indy Pride Festival), media (e.g., IndyStar), sports franchises (e.g., Indy Eleven and Indy Fuel), and the city's destination marketing organization, Visit Indy. The city's official website is indy.gov.\nNaptown\nThe term's original meaning is disputed. According to reporting from Indianapolis Monthly, the earliest reference to \"Naptown\" is from a 1927 Indianapolis Recorder article about jazz musicians. The term was coined as early as the 1920s by African American Jazz performers, stressing the fourth syllable in IN-dee-\u0259-NAP-\u0259-lis.\nThe term later evolved as a pejorative term for the city's perceived dullness. Humorist Will Rogers described the city as \"the only farm I've ever seen with a monument in the center\".\nHistoric nicknames\nCity of Railroads\nThe nickname \u201cCity of Railroads\u201d was first used in the Indianapolis Locomotive of September 1849, two years following the arrival of the Indianapolis and Madison Railroad and four years before the opening of the world's first union station in the city. It was frequently used through the 1870s.\nIndianoplace or India-no-place\nThese variations originated in the 1960s as pejorative terms referring to the city's perceived dullness or provincial attitudes.\nSubculture and groups\nChindianapolis\n\"Chindianapolis,\" a blending of Chin and Indianapolis, refers to the city's growing population of Chin people.\nNo Mean City\nA pamphlet about the Indianapolis Community Chest prominently features the \u201cNo Mean City\" moniker in 1921.\n\"No Mean City\" originates from the Christian Bible (KJV), Acts 21:39: \"But Paul said, 'I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.'\" In this context, \"no mean city\" refers to a city that is not insignificant.\nIndianapolis resident and former U.S. president Benjamin Harrison borrowed the verse in a 1897 speech: \"I am, myself, a citizen of no mean city.\" This was later echoed by local politicians, including Mayor Charles A. Bookwalter (1901\u20131903; 1906\u20131910). On July\u00a027, 1909, Bookwalter presided over ceremonies for the cornerstone laying of the new City Hall, inscribed with President Harrison's quote.\nThe slogan resurfaced in 2015 by opponents of Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, invoking \"No Mean City\" to represent a welcoming and inclusive city.\nMarketing slogans\nAmateur Sports Capital of the World\nThe \"Amateur Sports Capital of the World\" moniker came to prominence in the 1980s as the city promoted itself as a sports tourism destination, amidst capital investments in sports facilities and bids to host major events. Several amateur sports associations have been or are currently based in the city, including the Amateur Athletic Union (1970\u20131996), the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and the",

    "\nMain article: List of fatal dog attacks\nWarning sign in Portuguese: \"Beware of the dog\"\nThis is a list of human deaths caused by dogs, which have been documented through news media, reports, cause-of-death statistics, scientific papers, or other sources. The attribution of the dog type or breed is assigned by the sources. For additional information on causes of death and studies related to fatalities resulting from dog bites or attacks, see Fatal dog attacks.\nBrazil is moving closer to the goal of eliminating deaths due to dog-mediated rabies. Since 1983 the incidence of dog-borne rabies has decreased by almost 98% with only six reported cases in 2021. Between 2010 and 2021, 39 cases of human rabies transmitted by various species were recorded. The last reported fatality due to dog transmitted rabies happened in 2010 in Cear\u00e1.\nIn 2023, the number of fatalities due to dog attacks increased significantly. S\u00e3o Paulo recorded the highest number of cases in the country, with 19 deaths, representing a 137.5% increase compared to the previous year. Rio Grande do Sul saw 7 deaths, reflecting a 40% increase, while Goi\u00e1s experienced a 200% increase.\nIn April 2024, in response to a series of severe and fatal dog attacks, Member of Parliament Julio Cesar Ribeiro introduced an amendment to the penal code aimed at regulating such incidents. The proposed amendment suggests that walking certain dogs in public spaces without a muzzle should be deemed a criminal offense, carrying a potential prison sentence ranging from 15 days to 6 months. Ribeiro emphasized that these measures are not intended to penalize the dogs themselves but rather to hold owners accountable for failing to take necessary precautions to ensure community safety. Concerned about the increase in dog attacks and deaths Member of Parliament M\u00e1rio Heringer pushes for a change in the law for some time. His drafted legislation (PL 7316) requires owners of specific dogs to possess a certificate of ownership for their animals. Furthermore, the draft proposes mandates for the containment of dogs within private properties through the use of appropriate gates and fences, aiming to prevent their presence on public roads. Criminal liability in the event of attacks is also addressed in the proposed legislation.\nSummary counts of fatalities by year\nOfficial deaths per year from the Mortality Information System (SIM) of the Ministry of Health (Brazil):\nFatalities in 2024\nThis article contains dynamic lists that may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness.

    "Ongoing occupation protest in Quebec, Canada\nThe McGill University pro-Palestinian encampment is an ongoing occupation protest which has been taking place on the downtown campus of McGill University, in Montreal, since 27 April 2024. It was the first notable Canadian demonstration in the 2024 movement of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses, which call for universities to cut ties with Israel amid the country's assault on Gaza in the Israel\u2013Hamas war. Like many of its predecessors, the protest at McGill takes the form of an encampment, a group of tents occupied day and night by protesters.\nThe encampment was organized by a collective of pro-Palestinian student groups from McGill and the nearby Concordia University. Their demands were for those universities to cut ties with Israel, including by divesting from Israel-related funds such as weapons manufacturers. Roughly 20 tents were initially set up close to the Roddick Gates and encircled by a metal fence. In the following days, the encampment grew to roughly 100 tents. It is equipped with various amenities and hosts daily activities related to the protest. Students and faculty from various Montreal universities, which also include the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al and Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, occupy the tents.\nMcGill University has stated that the encampment is illegal and has requested police assistance to dismantle it. The university's president, Deep Saini, accused protesters of antisemitism, which they have denied. As of yet, Montreal's police department has not attempted to dismantle the encampment, which has been repeatedly described as peaceful. The Superior Court of Quebec rejected an injunction request against the protest, which had been filed on behalf of two students who described a hostile climate around the encampment. The premier of Quebec, Fran\u00e7ois Legault, has joined McGill in declaring the encampment illegal and requesting police intervention. The encampment's members have stated their intention to remain on site until their demands are met.\nBackground\nStudent groups\nSince the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October 2023, student groups at Montreal's two English-language universities, McGill and Concordia, have taken on a visible role as they have held protests and demonstrations in support of either Palestine or Israel. On 8 November 2023, an altercation erupted at Concordia after two student groups, Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) Concordia and StartUp Nation, set up neighbouring kiosks in a common space. The former was raising funds for the Gaza humanitarian crisis while the latter sought to raise awareness about hostages held by Hamas. Three injuries were reported and a student was arrested. On 19 December, McGill removed the university's name from its chapter of SPHR after reviewing a since-deleted social media post describing the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October as \"heroic\".\nProtests against McGill's investments\nAt McGill University, pro-Palestinian groups have protested against the institution's investments in Israel-related funds, including weapons manufacturers. In a referendum held on 20 November 2023, 78% of participating students voted in favour of a policy calling on the university to cut ties with companies \"complicit in genocide\", as well as condemn Israel's bombing of the Gaza Strip. McGill threatened to end its agreement with its student union, the Students' Society of McGill University (SSMU), if the latter ratified the policy. This agreement includes the SSMU's funding and their use of the McGill name. The Superior Court of Quebec halted the adoption of the policy after an injunction was filed by a student. On 19 February 2024, a small group of McGill students began a hunger strike to call on the university to divest from Israel. A protester who did not eat for 34 days was eventually sent to the hospital. On 22 February, demonstrators blocked the entrances of McGill's Bronfman building, where the Desautels Faculty of Management is located, to protest against that particular faculty's investments in Israel.\nComposition of McGill's endowment fund\nInvestments in Lockheed Martin, which supplies fighter jets to Israel, are especially contested\nOn 18 April 2024, two of McGill's pro-Palestinian student groups published a data set compiling 50 Israel-related companies that the university held investments in as of 31 December 2023. These investments, which were publicly disclosed on McGill's website, totalled at least $73 million. Of this amount, more than $5.5 million were invested in military technology companies which have contracts with the IDF, including Lockheed Martin, Thales, Safran, Dassault, Airbus and BAE Systems. Multiple other companies who operate in Israeli settlements, as well as large Canadian banks, listed because of their own investments in weapons manufacturers, appear in the data set.

    "\nThe Court-Martial of Appeal (Swedish: Krigshovr\u00e4tten) was a Swedish court. It was the appellate court among military courts and heard cases appealed from regimental courts-martial. The establishment of Sweden's first military appellate court, the Colonel's War Court, occurred through Gustavus Adolphus' Articles of War in 1621. Later, during Queen Christina's reign, this court became a division of the War College. In 1791, the Court-Martial of Appeal was created, initially consisting of at least 7 members, including military officers and a justiciar. Dissolved briefly, it was revived in 1797 and designated as the appellate court during peacetime. Over time, its composition and role evolved, eventually becoming a division of the Svea Court of Appeal in 1916. Finally, with the Military Court Proceedings Act of 1948, military cases in peacetime transitioned to ordinary courts, leading to the abolition of the Court-Martial of Appeal in 1949.\nHistory\nThrough Gustavus Adolphus' Articles of War of 15 July 1621, a field court-martial, called the Colonel's War Court (\u00d6verste Krigsr\u00e4tt i F\u00e4lt), was established, which can be regarded as Sweden's first proper military appellate court. This court, which, like the Svea Court of Appeal established in 1614, judged the King's verdicts, had the Lord High Constable as its president and a number of senior military officers as its members. During Queen Christina's reign, the War Court became a division of the War College with the College President, the Lord High Constable, as president, along with 6 military officers and the same number of collegiate assessors as assistants. However, in 1683, by Charles XI, two military appellate courts were established, namely a General War Court (General-Krigsr\u00e4tt) for the army and an Admiralty Court (Amiralitets-R\u00e4tt) for the navy. These courts consisted exclusively of military members.\nIn 1774, the cases of the General War Court were once again transferred to the War College, where they were handled for 17 years. Then, on 14 March 1791, King in Council's proclamation \"regarding a single and general appellate court in Stockholm for the entire King in Council's Armed Forces on land and at sea in Sweden and Finland\" came. The new appellate court was called the Court-Martial of Appeal (Krigshovr\u00e4tt)) in the proclamation, a designation encountered here for the first time. On the same day, it received a special procedural order. The King in Council's Court-Martial of Appeal would consist of at least 7 members, including the president, of which 6 would be military officers and one would be a justiciar.\nThe Court-Martial of Appeal was dissolved a few years later but was revived by a royal proclamation in 1797. In the Articles of War of 1798, it was determined that the Court-Martial of Appeal would serve as the appellate court during peacetime, while during wartime, special appellate courts should be appointed: a General War Court for the land army and superior courts for the navies. The position of justiciar was changed in 1827 to a Lord Justice of Court-Martial of Appeal's (krigshovr\u00e4ttsr\u00e5d) office.\nAccording to the Royal Ordinance on Military Courts on 11 June 1868, the Court-Martial of Appeal was the second court within the military (\u00a7 2). When ordered by the king, a special Supreme Military Court (\u00d6verkrigsr\u00e4tt) could be established for an army outside the realm or for a fleet on a naval expedition (\u00a7 12), or for both jointly. The Court-Martial of Appeal was composed of four military members appointed by the king for three years, namely a general officer as president and three regimental officers (including at least one with the rank of colonel), as well as a civilian member appointed by the king with the title of Lord Justice of Court-Martial of Appeal. Of the three regimental officers, one was to be from the navy, while the other two were from the army. In addition to being the appellate court for military courts, the Court-Martial of Appeal also immediately handled certain cases, namely those involving crimes committed by officers, and other cases specified by separate legislation for immediate review and judgment by the appellate court.\nThe public prosecutor at the Court-Martial of Appeal was, according to the law of 1914, the chief public court-martial prosecutor (\u00f6verkrigsfiskalen). Until then, it was the court-martial prosecutor (krigsfiskalen). In 1916, the military appellate court underwent a profound transformation. Through the military legislation in force from that year until 1949, the military appellate court became a division of the Svea Court of Appeal. Of the previous composition of the military appellate court, the military appellate court judge and two military members, one for the army and one for the navy, were retained. In addition, two hovr\u00e4ttsr\u00e5d from the Svea Court of Appeal were now included, one serving as the president.\nThe Military Court Proceedings Act (Milit\u00e4r r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngslag (1948:472)) of 30 June 1948 stipulated th",
    "Israeli-American abstract painter and site-specific installation artist\nRotem Reshef\nRotem Reshef (Hebrew: \u05e8\u05ea\u05dd \u05e8\u05e9\u05e3; born 1964) is an Israeli-American abstract painter and site-specific installation artist known for her process-based action painting technique and large-scale works, characterized by vivid and exuberant compositions. She works and lives in Tel Aviv and New York. She presented solo museum exhibitions at the Katonah Museum of Art in Katonah, New York, the Bakersfield Museum of Art in Bakersfield, California and at the Steinhardt Museum of Natural History in Tel Aviv.\nBiography\nRotem Reshef was born in Rehovot, Israel. Her maternal grandfather is the Zionist leader Moshe Smilansky. Her parents are Yehezkel (Hezi) Avivi, honorary citizen of Rehovot  and Tsila Avivi. She has two siblings; her brother is the film producer Gidi Avivi. She attended and graduated from the HaMidrasha \u2013 Faculty of the Arts, Ramat HaSharon (1985\u20131988). During her studies, she was the recipient of the America-Israel Cultural Foundation (AICF) Sharett Prize for Young Artists. She took part in a group exhibition of the awarded artists at the Ramat Gan Museum of Israeli Art She received her Master's in Museology from Reinwardt Academie, Amsterdam, Netherlands (2002\u20132004).\nIn 2010, Reshef won the Arte Laguna Prize. Her paintings covered two of the winery's bottle labels. Her work, \u201cDeep\u201d, was awarded an honorable mention in the London International Creative Competition (LICC) in 2014. She participated as an artist-in-residence at the following institutes: in 2015 at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, in 2021 at Residency Unlimited and in 2022 at The New York Art Residency and Studios (NARS) Foundation, both in Brooklyn, New York.\nMurals by her are on permanent display in Detroit, Michigan and in Zaritsky Artists\u2019 House in Tel Aviv.\nPersonal life\nRotem Reshef is married to Shai Reshef, the founder and president of the University of the People. She has four grown-up children.\nArtistic tradition and practice\nIn an article about Reshef in Haaretz, Prof. Avraham Balaban characterized her as a student of Raffi Lavie from the Want of Matter art school, who took the opposite path and followed Ofakim Hadashim school of Joseph Zaritsky, an Abstract Artist, painted in a vivid abundance colors. Her style brings to mind Action Painting or Process Art, which works in two and three-dimensional forms in sculptural painting installations. Her work is based on the tradition of Jackson Pollock, following the footsteps of Katharina Grosse\u2019s site-specific installations and Sam Gilliam\u2019s large-scale indoor/outdoor works. Reshef's installations are site-specific and relate to the surroundings of the exhibition space. She used to collect foliage and place them on a scroll, according to her scheme. The Curator and art critic, Peter Frank wrote: \u201cIn her painting installations, Reshef looks for circumstances, historical and contemporary. And in those circumstances, she identifies social and economic factors\u2026  Reshef alludes to discrete but simultaneous conditions and standpoints, not to judge them so much as to share them with us so as to prompt our own investigation. Reshef provides the metaphors, we pursue the comprehensions\u2026 She seeks\u2026 to\u2026 translating a social and scientific discourse into aesthetic sensation.\u201d \nBodies of work and exhibitions\nIn earlier works, starting in 2010, Reshef used a painting technique in diluted acrylic paint and intuitive work without brushes. For her first installation exhibition in Art Space TLV in 2016, Sagi Refael, the exhibition's curator, named it \"Control | Release,\" a method of painting described her creation style ever since. It comprised 44 meters (142 feet) of painting scrolls hung from the ceiling to the floor and surrounding the gallery. In 2017, Reshef installed her wide-ranging composition \u201cTime Traveler\u201d in a solo exhibition at the Tall Wall Space in the University of La Verne, California. Photographer and videographer Eric Minh Swenson documented the formation of that composition on-site. \"Time Traveler\" was created with six scrolls of paintings interwoven horizontally and vertically into a color-blended big grid. Symbolizing the passage of time, the four seasons interlaced to create a cohesive tapestry in the entire installation. The canvases were rendered with diverse techniques, colors, and ambiance, reflecting our period and inundated by images from all directions. The six scroll paintings are blended in a clash of simultaneous climates, denoting the climate change phenomenon as rain and storms in the summer and heat waves in the winter. \u201cTime Traveler\u201d was in a new contour at the Kwan Fong Art Gallery at California Lutheran University, renamed \u201cTime Traveler: Part ll - Compass\u201d, as a more political expansion of the original artwork. By \"Compass\", Reshef offers the viewers inner introspection in an era of visionless leaders who cannot navigate their countries and communities onto havens. The ar",

    "Finnish anti-immigration activist and town councillor\nJunes Lokka (born January 14, 1979) is an anti-immigration activist. From 2017 to 2021, Lokka served in the Oulu city council from the True Finnish Joint List (ASYL). His activity on social media is focused on video broadcasts. Lokka is taking part in the 2024 European Parliament elections as a candidate for the Freedom Alliance.\nCriminal proceedings\nIn the 2017 municipal elections, Lokka was elected to the Oulu city council from the joint list of the ASYL. During the negotiation of trust positions, ASYL's representatives were excluded from the trust positions due to Lokka's bad behavior and inappropriate language. Lokka denied having used inappropriate language. He claimed that inappropriate behavior occurred towards ASYL representatives. In the procedural dispute raised by Lokka's council group, the administrative court sided with ASYL regarding the meeting's technical violation, but the supreme administrative court considered the inadequate procedures in some places to be acceptable considering the whole.\nIn September 2018, the Oulu district court sentenced Lokka to pay a fine for incitement against an ethnic group.\nIn February 2019, several decisions were made not to indict Lokka for the crimes he was suspected of committing.\nJournalist Johanna Vehkoo was charged with defamation when in November 2016 she had called Lokka on Facebook, among other things, a Nazi, a Nazi clown and a racist. The Oulu district court sentenced Vehkoo to pay a fine for defamation in April 2019. Lokka had demanded compensation of 1,500 euros, but according to the district court, Lokka's own behavior reduced the compensation. Vehkoo appealed the verdict to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the verdict. Vehkoo received permission to appeal to the Supreme Court, which rejected the charge with a preliminary decision issued on January 11, 2022. According to the Supreme Court, Vehkoo's writing was aimed at \"Lokka's conduct in politics or comparable public activities and which concerned a subject of general interest\" and considering Lokka's own conduct, Vehkoo's writing did not exceed the limits of acceptability.\nOn April 12, 2019, the Oulu Prosecutor's Office announced two charges against Junes Lokka for incitement against an ethnic group. In February 2020, the Oulu district court sentenced Lokka to fines for inciting against an ethnic group. The Rovaniemi Court of Appeal kept the district court's verdict unchanged. In its decision in November 2022, the Supreme Court upheld Lokka's previous fine. The verdict concerned the videos he published on YouTube, which contained speeches given at a demonstration in Helsinki in August 2016, which the Supreme Court considered to be hate speech aimed at immigrants and Muslims.\nEarlier in April 2019, Lokka was charged with four counts of defamation and spreading information that violates private life.\nIn January 2021, Twitter suspended Lokka's account for violating the rules. In the same year, the district court of Oulu convicted him of inciting against an ethnic group. Lokka had suggested hiring death squads. In December 2021, the District Court of Oulu sentenced Lokka to a fine for defamation, which means that with his income, the amount of fines came to 285 euros, and he was also ordered to pay 400 euros in damages. The events that led to the verdict began during the 2017 municipal elections, when Lokka was not accepted as a participant in the election panel, to which only party representatives had been invited.\nIn 2022, the Oulu District Court found Junes Lokka guilty of three counts of defamation and one of spreading information that violates private life. According to the district court, a fair verdict would have been a fine, but the trial had been delayed by a year, so as compensation, Lokka was not punished.\nJournalist Tommi Parkkonen was sentenced to a fine and to pay one thousand euros in compensation to Lokka in 2022. Parkkonen was deemed to have insulted Lokka's honor in a tweet he sent in April 2019, in which he commented on the case concerning Johanna Vehkoo.\n",
    "Gustave Dor\u00e9's 1867 print of the ape astride a sea monster\nThe Ape (or monkey) and the Dolphin is one of Aesop\u2019s Fables and is numbered 73 in the Perry Index. Due to its appearance among La Fontaine's Fables, it has always been popular in France, but in Britain treatment of the story was rarer until the 19th century.\nThe fable\nFollowing a shipwreck off the Greek coast, a pet monkey belonging to a mariner is rescued from drowning by a dolphin. On being asked whether he is from Athens, the monkey boasts that he belongs to one of the city's foremost families. The dolphin then enquires whether he has visited Piraeus (the Athenian seaport), but the monkey thinks that a person is meant and replies that they are the best of friends. Taking a closer look at his passenger, the dolphin realises that he has not rescued a human being and swims off, leaving the monkey to his fate. The fable closes with the assurance that the story is suitable for liars.\nLatin versions of the fable began with the explanation that it was a maritime custom to take along pet animals during voyages, and their example was followed during the Renaissance by Gabriele Faerno in \"Simius et Delphus\", the poem he composed for his very popular collection Fabulae Centum (1563). He was followed afterwards in French by Jean de La Fontaine, who included the story among his Fables (1668) under the title \"Le singe et le dauphin\", with the added observation that according to the natural historian Pliny the Elder dolphins are friendly to the human species. \nThe fable in Britain\nProse accounts of the fable began appearing soon afterwards in Britain, including in the Mythologia Ethica (1689) of Philip Ayres, who also repeats Pliny's observation and titles the story \"The Ape and the Dolphin\". So did Roger L'Estrange in his collection of Aesop's fables a few years later, concluding at the end of his reflexion on the story that \"we have Apes in History, as well as in Fiction, and not a Rush matter whether they go on Four Legs, or on Two\". The grammarian Louis Chambaud goes further in his Fables choisies: a l'usage des enfans, et des autres personnes (1692), concluding his own relation of the fable by asking whether drowning would not be a suitable end for human liars too.\nThe fable was ignored by the main fable collections of the 18th century but appeared in the curiously titled Aesop Unveiled, Or, The Beauties of Deformity: Being a Poetical Translation of Several Curious Fables Out of Aesop and Other Approv'd Mythologists Equally as Diverting and Beneficial to the English Reader as His Comic Shape and Instructive Morals Were to the Ancients (1731). The story is treated with jogtrot joviality and concludes with the moral:\nDeceivers are oftentimes left in the briars\nFor none are so odious to all men as liars.\nSeveral more amateur poets retold the fable of the ape and the dolphin in the next century and, though they did not always acknowledge their source as La Fontaine, its provenance is witnessed by the detail of the dolphin's friendship for man being on Pliny's authority. These versions were to be found both in books, as in the case of John Lettice and Elizabeth Pipe Wolferstan, or as anonymous submissions to such transient periodicals as The Yorkshireman and The illustrated sailors' magazine, and new nautical miscellany. George Hardinge, on the other hand, in his poem \"The Monkey and the Dolphin\", gave the ape a leisurely treatment of some 56 lines as the teller of very tall stories.\nIn later years, the fable was included in methodical prose accounts, gathered \"chiefly from original sources\",  such as those by the clergyman Thomas James, George Fyler Townsend, and Vernon Jones. All of these gave it the title \"The Monkey and the Dolphin\", as did the anonymous American editor of Aesop for Children (Chicago, 1919). The text from this was used much later by Dev Virahsawmy to accompany his adaptation of the fable into Mauritian Creole as Zistwar Zako ek Dofen.\nArtistic treatments\nThe fable's appearance among La Fontaine's fables led to its being included in The labyrinth of Versailles during the 1670s. The 34th sculpture there is ascribed to Georges Sibrayque and once featured a dolphin from whose mouth a fountain jets while the gesturing ape rides on its back. A later park sculpture of the fable, now in the Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, was carved in polished sandstone by Jean-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Ringel d'Illzach in 1903. Various pictorial artists have also illustrated the fable, among whom were Gustave Dor\u00e9 and Gustave Moreau.\n",

He has explored and advocated for the benefits and feasibility of a shared parenting arrangement where both parents work part-time while also spending time at home with their children.\nEducation\nVon Baeyer completed his BA in psychology in 1971 from the University of British Columbia, followed by an MA in 1974 and PhD in 1978 from the University of Waterloo in clinical psychology.\nCareer\nVon Baeyer joined the faculty of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon in 1978, assuming various positions. His noteworthy roles included terms as Director of Clinical Psychology Training for the PhD program and chair of the Behavioural Sciences Research Ethics Board.\nVon Baeyer founded and directed the Internship (Residency) Training in Clinical Psychology from 1982 to 1989 and pioneered the Pediatric Complex Pain Clinic Pilot Project in 2009.\nVon Baeyer is a professor emeritus of Psychology at the University of Saskatchewan. After retirement from the University of Saskatchewan and moving from Saskatoon to Winnipeg, he co-chaired the Pediatric Pain Interdisciplinary Interest Group at Children's Hospital, Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, from 2013 to 2017. Additionally, he served as one of five co-principal investigators and co-founders of 'Pain in Child Health', a training initiative in health research funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. He chaired the ChildKind International Resource Library from 2015 to 2018.\nResearch\nVon Baeyer has authored or co-authored over 120 research articles. His works have been cited over 17,000 times according to Google Scholar.\nIn his 1994 research, von Baeyer investigated whether repeated clinical pain measurement affects perceived pain intensity and distress in low-back-pain patients, finding that daily self-monitoring does not significantly alter subjective pain intensity over an 8-day period.\nMuch of von Baeyer's work has focused on pediatric pain. His 2001 collaborative study introduced and validated the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R), a six-face adaptation of the original seven-face FPS for children's pain assessment. It demonstrated a strong correlation with visual analogue and colored analogue scales, suitable for ages 4\u201312, adhering to a 0-10 metric. In a 2004 publication, he examined the impact of children's memories of painful experiences on their later reactions to pain and healthcare interventions, discussing developmental, individual, situational, and methodological factors, as well as strategies to mitigate negative consequences. In related research, he discussed the assessment of pain intensity in children aged five and older, emphasizing the importance of self-reports while also acknowledging potential biases and errors. The study also explored various pain intensity scales, their limitations, and the need for interpretation alongside other sources of information. This 2007 work provided a systematic review commissioned by Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT), focusing on observational pain scales for children aged 3 to 18. It identified 20 scales, recommended specific ones for acute pain contexts, and suggested further research for chronic pain assessment. In 2009, he presented validation data supporting the use of the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for self-report of pain intensity in children aged 8 years and older, demonstrating functional equivalence with other self-report pain scales like the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Moreover, in 2017, he co-edited a book titled Chronic and Recurrent Pain, which highlighted the prevalence and impact of pediatric chronic pain, discussing various conditions, their consequences, and advocating for improved recognition and treatment strategies to advance understanding and care for affected children.\nVon Baeyer's 2018 study investigated the validity and reliability of the Verbal Numerical Rating Scale (VNRS) as a measure of pain intensity in children aged 4 to 17 years, finding strong support for its use in children aged 6 to 17 years but cautioning against its use in those aged 4 and 5 years due to weaker convergent validity. In his 2019 work, he studied clinically significant changes in pain scores among children with painful conditions, using VNRS and FPS-R scales. Taking into account initial pain intensity and patient characteristics, the study offered guidelines for clinical practice and research. A l",
    "Constituency in Seoul, South Korea\nNowon B (Korean:\u00a0\ub178\uc6d0\uad6c \uc744) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Nowon District, Seoul. As of 2024, 211,043 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Dobong constituency.\nHistory\nSince its establishment, Nowon B has elected members of the Democratic Party and predecessor parties in all but two elections and is thus regarded as a stronghold for the Democratic Party.\nKim Yong-chae of the right-wing New Democratic Republican Party was the first member to represent Nowon B, narrowly defeating Lim Chae-jung of the centre-left Peace Democratic Party by a little over 1,000 votes. In the following election, Kim Yong-chae had initially won re-election by a margin of thirty-six votes. However, after it was discovered that a bundle of one hundred votes were mixed up and not counted properly, a recount was performed. The recount declared  Lim Chae-jung of the centre-left Democratic Party the winner with only 172 votes separating him from incumbent Kim Yong-chae. Lim won re-election in 1996 and 2000, but did not stand for re-election for Nowon B in 2004, running as the Uri Party candidate for the newly created Nowon C constituency instead. Lim was succeeded by Woo Won-shik of the Uri Party who defeated Kwon Young-jin of the centre-right Grand National Party. In a return match held at the next election, Kwon Young-jin defeated Woo, garnering 49.93% of the vote while Woo received 44.09%. In the 2012 election, Woo and Kwon faced off again; Woo ended up narrowly defeating incumbent Kwon Young-jin by a margin of 1.78%. Woo comfortably won re-election in 2016 and 2020, receiving 51.95 and 62.67% of the vote respectively.\nAhead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, the Nowon C constituency was abolished as a result of a decrease in population in Nowon District. Incumbent member Woo Won-shik ran in the Nowon A constituency after beating incumbent Koh Yong-jin in a primary and Nowon C incumbent Kim Sung-hwan was nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate for Nowon B. Kim Sung-hwan went on to win in the general election with 58.51% of the vote.\nBoundaries\nThe constituency encompasses Junggye 1-dong, Junggye 4-dong, and Sanggye-dong. It borders the constituencies of Uijeongbu B to the north, Dobong A and Dobong B to the west, Nowon A to the south, and Namyangju B to the east.\nList of members of the National Assembly\nElection results\n2024\n2020\n2016\n2012\n2008\n2004\n2000\n1996\n1992\n1988\nSee also\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\nNotes\n^ Declared the winner after a recount; won by a margin of 172 votes\n",

    "Indian comedian and actor (1983\u20132009)\nEddisson Rosario Fernandes (born Eddison Rosario Fernandes; 14 June 1983 \u2013 17 October 2009), also known mononymously as Edison, was an Indian comedian, actor, singer, composer, writer, businessman, and former keyboardist known for his work in Konkani films and tiatr (theatre) productions.\nEarly life\nFernandes was born as Eddison Rosario Fernandes on 14 June 1983, at Dr. A. V. Da Costa Memorial Clinic in the suburb of Fatorda, located in the state of Goa, India. His parents were Martin and Josefa Mariquinha Alberta Fernandes. Upon the conclusion of his academic pursuits, Fernandes initiated the establishment of a service entity named Master Engineering in the census town of Varca. The company offered a variety of services including air-conditioning supply and maintenance, electrical services, and technical assistance. They catered to a diverse clientele, serving both the public and high-end hotels in the area. In addition to his business endeavors, Fernandes undertook a theater program at the T.A.C.T Institute located in Margao. It was through his acting abilities showcased on the Konkani stage that Fernandes gained significant recognition.\nCareer\nFernandes emerged as a multifaceted contributor to the world of tiatrs, a unique form of Goan musical theater, showcasing his talents as a musician, writer, composer, singer, and actor. Initially establishing himself as a keyboardist, he embarked on his tiatr journey. In 2003, Fernandes made his first appearance in Puro Korat (Enough of That), a tiatr written by Konkani playwright Sharon Mazarello. The production not only participated in the Kala Academy's competition but also earned Fernandes the Best Supporting Actor Award for his performance. A breakthrough opportunity presented itself when Fernandes became involved in the non-stop show Tumi Tumche Dolle Ugddat (You All Open Your Eyes), directed by Konkani theater director Mario Menezes. It was during this phase that Fernandes showcased his acting skills, leaving an impression with his portrayal of a gay character in Ghorabeache Vantte (Division of Family). Furthermore, he displayed his comedic prowess by taking on a humorous role in Sharon's Konkani film Tum Kitem Kortolo Aslo? (2010). Fernandes' talents extended beyond acting, as he proved to be a composer and singer. In Mario Menezes' tiatr Love Story from 2009, his interpretation of the opening chorus, along with his rendition of the song \"Sobit Sopon\" in Dominic Fernandes' Konkani CD Mainchem Sukh, showcased his musical talents. Prior to his involvement in tiatrs, Fernandes honed his musical skills by initially playing the keyboard instrument in a band. Subsequently, he demonstrated his skills in Konkani theatrical productions by Pascoal Rodrigues and Peter de Macazana. Known for his comedic timing and promising acting potential, Fernandes made appearances in several Konkani movies, demonstrating his versatility as a performer while showcasing his vocal talents.\nIn 2007, Mario Menezes, a director within the realm of Konkani theatre affiliated with Menezes Theatre, identified the talent of Fernandes and assigned him the lead comedian role in the acclaimed play Tumi Tumche Dolle Ughddat. Sharing the stage with the Konkani comedienne Joanna, Fernandes delivered a memorable performance that garnered praise from both the director and the audience. This success paved the way for Fernandes to become a regular fixture in Menezes' subsequent productions, including Naginn, Hi Maim Konnanchi, the 2009 play Kal Aiz ani Faleam, and the tiatr titled Beiman Kir released in the same year. However, Fernandes' acting engagements were restricted to only two productions, culminating in his final performance held in his hometown of Orlim. Beyond his theatrical pursuits, Fernandes also made appearances in Konkani video films. He featured in Jacki-E's Hanv Ankvar Kiteak Urlom, where he shared the screen with Anita. Additionally, Fernandes showcased his comedic skills in comedian Michael's Chor Police, as well as Martin de Ponda's productions Puro Anink Naka and Bhogos Saiba. Fernandes showcased his versatility beyond acting as a musician, showcasing his talent in composing lyrics and performing his own musical compositions. One of his popular compositions was the solo titled \"Music, Music,\" which was sung by the young artist Rioma in the play Kal Aiz ani Faleam, a composition that left an impression on the audience. Fernandes' accomplishments include his performance of the song \"Sobit Sopon\" featured in the audio album \"Mainche Sukh,\" created by Domnic and Fernandes and distributed by Manfa Music. His last stage appearance was in Mario Menezes' play Kal Aiz ani Faleam. Beyond his involvement in the performing arts, Fernandes also held the position of proprietor at Master Engineering, showcasing his versatility and diverse interests.\nIn Sharon Mazarello's tiatr Tum Kitem Kortolo Aslo? at the Kala Academy Goa's 30th Tiatr Competition 2004\u20132005,",
    "\nThe Cuban Boxing Federation (FCB) was established in 1921 in Havana, Cuba. \nThe creation of the National Boxing Commission of Cuba was headed by former Cuban senator and colonel Rosendo Collazo. Collazo was the commission's first president and chairman. Alberto Puig de la Barca is the current Cuban Boxing Federation president.\nEarly history\nThe Cuban government formed a national commission to monitor boxing and regulate the sport in 1921, following a prior prohibition due to growing violence in the country.\nIn 1962, following the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s, the new leader Fidel Castro banned professional boxing. Cuban fighters were limited to the amateur boxing system, which allowed them to compete in the Olympics but excluded them from the lucrative professional fight circuit. In 2007, the International Amateur Boxing Association came under fire from the Cuban Boxing Federation, which claimed that professional boxing promoters who attend amateur boxing competitions are enticing fighters to defect.\nThe International Boxing Association (AIBA) and the Cuban Boxing Federation (FCB) signed a memorandum in 2015 stipulating that all FCB boxers will only participate in AIBA-approved contests, such as the World Series of Boxing (WSB) and AIBA Pro Boxing (APB).\nIn 1968, the federation began holding the Giraldo Cordova Cardin International Boxing Tournament in Havana, Cuba.\nThe Cuban Boxing Federation employed three doctors, a masseuse, and a sports psychologist year-round by 1987. During the early 2000s, the Cuban Boxing Federation appointed renowned Cuban fighter Teofilo Stevenson as its vice president.\n\n2022-present\nCuba ended its long-standing ban on professional boxing in April 2022, allowing fighters from that country to compete in professional bouts for the first time since the 1962 ban. The Cuban Boxing Federation signed a contract with Mexico's Golden Ring Promotions company, for the representation of Cuba in its entry into professional boxing. As per the agreement, the boxers would receive 80% of the revenue, with the remaining 20% being divided among the federation, trainers, and medics.\n\nAhead of the Olympic Games Paris 2024, the Cuban Boxing Federation declared in December 2022 that it would be lifting its prohibition on women's boxing and forming a national women's team.\n",

    "Norwegian-Australian economist (1890\u20131980)\nTorleiv Hytten CMG (17 February 1890 \u2013 2 January 1980) was a Norwegian-Australian economist and university administrator. He served as vice-chancellor of the University of Tasmania from 1949 to 1957. He was previously an economic adviser to the Tasmanian state government and the Bank of New South Wales.\nEarly life\nHytten was born on 17 February 1890 in Drammen, Norway. He was one of nine surviving children born to Marie Charlotte (n\u00e9e Knudsen) and Oscar Emil Hytten. His father was a master shoemaker.\nHytten was raised in poverty. He was educated in T\u00f8nsberg, but left school at a young age due to his family's financial situation.\nFirst years in Australia\nHytten immigrated to Australia in 1910, initially settling in New South Wales and working for periods as a labourer in Newcastle, at a ship chandler in Sydney, and as a truck driver in Broken Hill. He lived in Broken Hill between 1913 and 1918, where he was active in trade unions and attended Workers' Educational Association (WEA) sessions. He was influenced by WEA lecturer Herbert Heaton and began writing for local newspapers.\nIn 1918, Hytten moved to Tasmania and found work in the mining districts on the West Coast, also writing for the Zeehan and Dundas Herald. He kept in touch with Heaton and soon moved to Hobart where he became secretary of the local branch of the WEA and worked as a journalist for the The World and the short-lived News. He was the chief leader writer for the News on foreign affairs.\nHytten graduated Bachelor of Arts at the University of Tasmania in 1922 and was naturalised as a British subject the following year.\nCareer\nAcademia\nIn 1926, Hytten was appointed as a temporary lecturer at the University of Tasmania. He completed a Master of Arts in 1929 with a thesis on transport economics. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Douglas Copland and succeeded Copeland as professor of economics in 1930. He was also influenced by his colleagues L. F. Giblin and Jim Brigden.\nResigning in 1935 to move to the private sector, Hytten returned to the University of Tasmania in August 1949. He was the first position to hold the position on a full-time basis. His tenure proved contentious and he dealt with a number of issues, including poor working conditions, low staff salaries, and delays in the planned move from The Domain to a new campus at Sandy Bay. Hytten was ultimately responsible for the controversial dismissal of philosophy professor Sydney Sparkes Orr on grounds of sexual impropriety in 1956, although he claimed to have been forced in to the dismissal by the university's council. He had a close relationship with university chancellor John Morris, but was viewed as out of touch by staff and students. A royal commission into the Orr case was critical of his actions and he resigned as vice-chancellor in 1957.\nGovernment and banking work\nHytten served as an economic adviser to the Tasmanian state government from 1929 to 1935. He gave evidence on Tasmania's evidence before federal bodies during the Great Depression, including the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Initially appointed by Nationalist premier John McPhee, he subsequently worked closely with Australian Labor Party (ALP) premier Albert Ogilvie. In 1935 he was chosen to represent Tasmania at the Silver Jubilee of George V, along with Ogilvie and Frank Gaha. The three subsequently toured Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, reportedly the first such official delegation from any Australian government to visit the Soviet Union.\nIn 1935, Hytten joined the Bank of New South Wales as an economic adviser, remaining with the bank until 1949. In that year he reportedly oversaw a staff of eight researches in the bank's economic department. He opposed the Chifley government's attempts at bank nationalisation, which were overturned by the High Court in Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth. He was a founding member of the Economic Society of Australia and served as chairman from 1933 to 1939 and from 1946 to 1947. He was later appointed by the Menzies government to the board of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, serving from 1954 to 1959.\nHytten attracted public attention in 1949 with his comments opposing the existing bipartisan consensus on full employment, suggesting that a permanent unemployment rate of between six and eight percent would be ideal for economic stability. His comments were publicly criticised by federal government minister H. V. Evatt and appeared in ALP campaign materials in the lead-up to the 1949 federal election. In response Hytten stated that the advertisements came \"close to libel\" and denied any political affiliation, stating that his remarks had been in response to the White Paper on Full Employment in Australia and had been taken out of context.\nPersonal life and honours\nIn 1922, Hytten married Margaret Compton, with whom he had two sons; one died in infancy. In retirement he and his wife moved to Scotland, ",

The 1997 world champion, Ken Doherty, shared the first two frames of his encounter with Tyson Crinis, but then took the third by only one point and made a break of 68 in the fourth to seal victory. Stuart Watson, ranked first in the seniors rankings, whitewashed three-time world semi-finalist Tony Knowles, although Knowles scored points in all three frames. In playing the 2021 semi-finalist Igor Figueiredo, Tessa Davidson became the second woman (after Maria Catalano in 2022) to ever take part in the main stage of the World Seniors Championship. Figueiredo won the opening frame, but Davidson took the second one, also becoming the first female player to win a frame at that stage of the tournament. Figueiredo then secured victory with a 3\u200d\u2013\u200d1 result.\nOn the second day, the 1997 International Open runner-up Tony Drago won 3\u200d\u2013\u200d1 over Michael Judge, with Drago scoring the exact same amount of points (73) in every frame he took.

    "\nMikalojus Lip\u010dius (also known as Mikas or Mykolas; 19 December 1894 \u2013 25 June 1942) was the head of interwar Lithuanian military intelligence services (1919\u20131923), Vice-Minister of the Interior (1923\u20131924), and director of the finance department of the Ministry of Finance (1927\u20131940).\nEarly life\nEarly life and studies\nMikalojus Lip\u010dius was born on 19 December 1893 in the village of Bernotai, then part of the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire. Through his mother Kotryna Lip\u010dien\u0117 n\u00e9e Ma\u010diulyt\u0117, Lip\u010dius was nephew to the priest and poet Maironis. Lip\u010dius attended the Betygala Primary School from 1901 to 1904, and the Palanga Middle School from 1904 to 1909. From 1909 to 1914 he attended a boy's gymnasium in Kaunas. He then studied at the Riga Polytechnic Institute from 1914 to 1916. From 1916 to 1918 he studied at the Russian State Agrarian University, where he met his future wife, the opera soloist Marija Lip\u010dien\u0117-Marcinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117. The couple married on 16 February 1920 in Kaunas. They had two children, Algirdas and Aldona. Aldona was a pianist, while Algirdas was the father of the cellist Saulius Lip\u010dius.\nLithuanian Wars of Independence\nIn July 1918, at the end of the First World War and the outbreak of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, Lip\u010dius returned to Lithuania. He joined the Lithuanian army on 30 December 1918. He served under Vincas Grigali\u016bnas-Glovackis\u00a0 in the 2nd Infantry Regiment. He diligently organized propaganda for the Lithuanian army to gather more volunteers. On 13 January 1919 he was assigned to the General Staff. He became a special affairs officer, a title given to covert military intelligence personnel.\nLip\u010dius (left) and Minister of Defense Antanas Merkys (right) with a British military mission, 1919\nCareer\nHead of intelligence\nSoon after he became acquainted with the News unit headed by Jonas \u017dilinskas. On 12 May the unit was renamed into the Unit of Intelligence, and two days later Lip\u010dius was transferred to the unit as \u017dilinskas's deputy. As \u017dilinskas was ill and could not lead the unit, on 10 June Lip\u010dius was made the temporary leader of the unit, and later the permanent leader on 12 July. However, Lip\u010dius soon fell ill himself and had to be substituted by Liudas Gira. Lip\u010dius's unit also participated in the discovery of the Polish Military Organisation's attempted coup of Lithuania. In 1921 he was awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis, 1st degree. Under his leadership, an official statute of the intelligence agency was written, connections with Latvian intelligence services were made, and courses for intelligence officers began. Lip\u010dius was the first to suggest that the intelligence unit issue certificates of trust to people seeking employment in state institutions, with the goal being to prevent compromised persons from holding responsible positions. In 1922, Lip\u010dius studied at Vytautas Magnus University.\nKlaip\u0117da Revolt\nLip\u010dius helped organize the Klaip\u0117da Revolt of 1923 by establishing intelligence gathering areas near the border with the Klaip\u0117da region, then administered by the League of Nations under a French administration. Lip\u010dius recruited and closely worked with Jonas Budrys, who was the head of counter-intelligence. Budrys was sent to Klaip\u0117da in 1922 to explore the possibility of a revolt.\nLater years\nVice-Minister and director\nOn 25 March 1923, by the decree of president Aleksandras Stulginskis, Lip\u010dius was made Vice-Minister of the Interior. Petras Kirlys succeeded Lip\u010dius as head of the Lithuanian intelligence on 10 April. Within the Ministry, Lip\u010dius helped establish a secret police independent of military intelligence and the Department of Civil Protection, which had the role of criminal police. Lip\u010dius also issued the creation of the Criminal Police Department \"B\" (Kriminalin\u0117s policijos skyrius \"B\"). From 1924 to 1927 Lip\u010dius, under state scholarship, studied at the Paris School of Political Sciences with specialty in state finance and administration. On 1 September 1927 Lip\u010dius was appointed the director of the finance department at the Lithuanian Ministry of Finance.  In 1936 he was awarded the Klaip\u0117da Liberation Medal and Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas.\nImprisonment and death\nAfter Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union, Lip\u010dius was arrested by Soviet authorities on 1 August 1940 and imprisoned in Kaunas and later Vilnius. He was sentenced to eight years of hard labour, and on 5 June 1941 was deported to Siberia to a camp near the Pechora river, where he died on 25 June 1942.\n",
    "1876 Krupp rifled breach loader gun\nThe 30.5\u00a0cm Ring Kanone L/22 was a 30.5\u00a0cm 22 caliber long Krupp Ring Kanone. It was a rifled breech loader built-up gun with a Krupp cylindroprismatic horizontal sliding breech. The gun became famous when it was exhibited at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair. It did not enter service, but did lead to the development of the 30.5 cm MRK L/22.\nContext\nBackground: Heavier armor on ships\nIn mid 1872 and May 1873, the German military held trials with what was then its heaviest gun, the 28 cm RK L/22. In an August 1873 note about the May 1873 trials, the artillery test commission noted that the 28\u00a0cm gun would not be strong enough in the near future.\nAt the time, some new ships had armor belts of 305\u00a0mm thickness with a supporting layer that was even stronger than the 18\u00a0in (457\u00a0mm) of teak found on Warrior. Other ships like Petr Veliky and a new British class were partly protected by 355\u00a0mm armor. These developments meant that in order to assure the superiority of the coastal artillery over ship armor, a heavier caliber than 28\u00a0cm was necessary.\nDevelopment of the 30.5 cm RK L/22\nThe Vienna gun\nThe 30.5 cm RK L/22 as showpiece on the Vienna fair\n30.5 cm RK L/22 in Vienna\nWhile the German authorities were making plans, the Krupp steelworks pro-actively developed the 30.5\u00a0cm Ring Kanone L/22 to counter prospective advances in ship armor. Krupp initially made two of these guns. One of these guns was used for testing.\nThe other 30.5\u00a0cm gun was the showpiece of the Krupp pavilion on the 1 May to 31 October 1873 Vienna World's Fair. The 30.5\u00a0cm L/22 gun got extensive media coverage by its appearance on the Vienna fair. Multiple military delegations visited the fair and made reports about the gun. An extensive report with images was written by the Dutch captain A.M. Mazel.\nThe test gun was called 'gezogene 30,5\u00a0cm Kanone Nr. 1'. From 7 August 1872 to mid February 1873 it fired 230 shot.\nGermany considers the 30.5 cm RK L/22\nIn February 1874 the German government appointed a commission to investigate the situation on the North Sea and Baltic coast. The commission concluded that for the North Sea a heavier caliber gun than 28\u00a0cm was not necessary for most places and not enough in other places. On the Baltic coast, it found that a heavier gun could be useful, but that it was probably more efficient to invest in torpedoes and monitors.\nAlso in 1874, the German Admiralty considered the possibility of arming the projected Ausfallschiffe (small battleships for home waters) with the 30.5\u00a0cm Ring Kanone that Krupp had made in 1873. In 1874 Germany then ordered three 30.5\u00a0cm RK L/22 at Krupp.\nKrupp then offered a gun for a test against armor that took place on 7 July 1875. The target of the 1875 test was an iron armor plate of 10 inch backed up by a teak and then followed by a 6-inch armor plate backed by another layer of teak. Three shots were fired with 60\u00a0kg of prismatic pulver with a density of 1.74-1.76, two of these failed to penetrate the armor. The third shot only succeeded because it hit a spot that had been weakened by earlier hits. Two more shots were fired with 65\u00a0kg of gunpowder. These attained a velocity of about 460\u00a0m/s, or about 15\u00a0m/s higher than those fired with 60\u00a0kg of propellant. These shots easily penetrated the target.\nDuring the Winter of 1875/76 Krupp tested the gun with a charge of 65\u00a0kg of Prismatic Pulver c/75. It fired a 301\u00a0kg projectile with a velocity of 461\u00a0m/s. A kg of gunpowder then had 1,170\u00a0cm3 of space to explode in. The average gas pressure was 2,890\u00a0atm.\nLabels of the 30.5\u00a0cm L/22 guns\nKrupp referred to the 30.5\u00a0cm Ring Kanone as the 'Lange 30.5\u00a0cm Kanone' (see 30.5\u00a0cm RK L/22 in 1873 image). This was in line with Krupp's idea to have long (L/22) and short (L/20) versions of his guns. After the German navy had taken the 30.5 cm MRK L/22 into use, it had only one kind of 30.5\u00a0cm gun in service, and so it simply named the MRK the '30.5\u00a0cm Kanone'. When in 1885, the navy changed its naming system to include the length of its guns in calibers, this became the '30.5\u00a0cm Kanone L/22'. The 30.5\u00a0cm RK L/22 guns that Germany bought did not get an official label, because they were not adopted for service. If they had been, their label would probably have become 30.5\u00a0cm RK L/22 in 1885.\nCharacteristics of the Vienna gun\nOverview\nSketch of the RK L/22\nThe 30.5\u00a0cm RK L/22 was made according to the Ring Kanone system. It consisted of an inner tube and three layers of rings put on top of each other. One of the rings included the trunnions. Total length was 6,7\u00a0m or 22 calibers. The length of bore was 5.77\u00a0m. The length of the rifled part was 4.39\u00a0m. The total weight was 36,600\u00a0kg (i.e. 36 ton ). Charges were 50 or 60\u00a0kg of prismatic gunpowder. The report of the test gave some further details.\nThe gun had 72 parallel grooves with a twist length of 21.79\u00a0m. The grooves were 8.8\u00a0mm wide, the lands 4.5\u00a0mm wide. The grooves were 3.5\u00a0mm deep. The deep grooves were a feature of the",

    "Medical society in London, United Kingdom\nThe symbol of the Society in the translation of Theodor Schwann's Microscopical Researches\nThe Sydenham Society was a medical society instituted in 1843 in London with the goal of improving the dissemination of medical text by means of translation. The society was considered \"defunct\" in late 1857.\nIt was named after the English physician Thomas Sydenham  (1624\u201389). \nProspectus\nThe prospectus of the Society by the time of its foundation in 1843 stated that: \nThe Sydenham Society has been founded for the purpose of meeting certain acknowledged deficiencies in the diffusion of medical literature, which are not likely to be supplied by the efforts of individuals. It will carry this object into effect by distributing among its members \u2014\n1. Reprints of standard English medical works, which are rare and expensive.\n2. Miscellaneous Selections from the ancient and from the earlier modern authors, reprinted or translated.\n3. Digests of the most important matters contained in old and voluminous authors, British and foreign, with occasional biographical and bibliographical notices.\n4. Translations of the Greek and Latin medical authors, and of works in the Arabic and other Eastern languages, accompanied, when it is thought desirable, by the original text.\n5. Translations of recent foreign works of merit.\n6. Original works of great merit, which might be very valuable as books of reference, but which would not otherwise be published, from not being likely to have a remunerating sale,\u2014such as classified Bibliographies, and alphabetical Indexes to periodical publications and other valuable voluminous works.\nTranslations\nA coat of arms present in the cover of books edited by the society.\nThe members of the Society produced several medical translations.  As of 1856, membership in the society costed five dollars. Every year, the members received \"three volumes, handsomely bound in a uniform manner in cloth, gilt edged\".  New members could acquire any previous volume for two dollars and fifty cents, or combinations of 3 volumes for five dollars. \nAs of 2024, the works translated by the society have already fallen in the public domain and are available from online sources such as the Internet Archive. \nThe volumes edited by the society included: \nPresidents\nIn the term 1849-1850, the society was presided by Sir James Clark.\n",
    "In this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Dur\u00e1n and the second or maternal family name is  Flores.\nMercedes Dur\u00e1n Flores (August 9, 1933 \u2013 July 7, 1999), better known by the pseudonym Mercedes Durand, was a Salvadoran poet and journalist.\nShe was a member of the Committed Generation, a literary generation established in El Salvador in the 1950s, as well as the related Grupo Octubre. The poetry she wrote between 1979 and 1981 is considered some of the most important testimonial writing of this critical period in her country.\nOver the course of her life, Durand directed and presented various television and radio programs, and worked on numerous literary magazines in Mexico and El Salvador. From 1963 to 1970, she taught in the humanities department of the University of El Salvador, before her exile to Mexico amid political repression of academics. Her poetry was marked by a deep intimacy, romantic themes, precision, and simplicity, with her autobiographical poems centering on nature and love.\nEarly life and education\nDurand was born in San Salvador, El Salvador, in 1933. She began writing poetry at only 8 years old. After graduating from normal school in 1950, from 1952 to 1958 she pursued literary studies at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), under a scholarship from the Salvadoran government of \u00d3scar Osorio. Starting in 1950, she became a member of the Committed Generation and the Grupo Octubre, two interrelated groups of writers in El Salvador in this period.\nCareer\nDurand worked as a journalist and television producer, including as desk editor and contributor at La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica from 1958 to 1960, and as news editor at the Tribuna Libre from 1965 to 1967. She also wrote stories, poems, and essays for such Salvadoran publications as Humanismo and Cultura in the 1950s and '60s. In 1960, she won first prize in the Usulut\u00e1n Floral Games.\nShe taught in the humanities department of the University of El Salvador from 1963 to 1970. While at the university, she served as a member of the school's editorial board and as director of the magazine Vida Universitaria.\nHowever, in July 1972, President Arturo Armando Molina ordered an intervention into the university's activities, shutting down its academic and administrative operations and persecuting the university community. Durand was among the academics who were targeted in this period, and in 1972 she left for exile in Mexico.\nWhile in Mexico, she worked as an editor on the wire section of El D\u00eda from 1975 to 1976; for the news broadcaster Canal 13 in 1977; for the publisher Magisterio from 1975 to 1977; and as a copy editor at the publishing house Posada from 1974 to 1976. She also wrote scripts for the comic book publisher Novaro from 1973 to 1975, and taught at UNAM's Center for Communication Studies.\nFrom 1976, she was a founding member of the Latin American Federation of Journalists.\nPersonal life and death\nIn 1952, Durand married the Salvadoran poet Mauricio de la Selva, with whom she had one son. They divorced in 1958, and she later remarried the leftist activist Mario Salazar Valiente. The couple returned to El Salvador after the 1992 Chapultepec Peace Accords, but Salazar Valiente died of a heart attack one day later, which drove Durand to return to Mexico in grief. She died in Mexico City in 1999, at age 65.\nSelected works\nEspacios, Mexico, 1955\nSonetos elementales, San Salvador, 1958, illustrated by the painter Carlos Ca\u00f1as\nPoemas del hombre y del alba, San Salvador, 1961\nLas manos en el fuego, with David Escobar Galindo\u00a0, 1969\nLas manos y los siglos, Mexico, 1970\nJuego de G\u00fcija, San Salvador, 1970\nTodos los vientos, poetry anthology, San Salvador, 1972\nA sangre y fuego, 1980\nSarah, la luna, la muchacha y otros poemas, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, 1982\nLa guerrilla de las ondas y otros ensayos, San Salvador\n",
    "Artistic movement in 20th-century Italy\nLombard line (Italian: Linea lombarda) is the name of an artistic movement that developed in Northern Italy, particularly in the region of Lombardy, at the end of the 19th century and flourished during the first three quarters of the 20th century.\nThis literary movement was named by Luciano Anceschi in his anthology Linea lombarda (1952), which included published and unpublished works by several authors.\nHistory\nThe term Linea lombarda comes from a set of themes and authors, in which a typically Lombard \u201cWeltanschauung\u201d is combined. Thus, the authors of late romanticism, Scapigliatura and symbolism, futurism and magic realism are all represented.\nDuring the 1950s a group of writers, poets and critics (who were linked to the definition of the Lombard line) was formed.

    "Indian independence activist (1921-42)\nPrabhu Narayan also spelt as Prabhu Narain was an Indian independence activist, who is known for his participation in Quit India movement of 1942. A resident of Khagaria district of Bihar, Narain was killed in 1942 while leading a flag procession during police firing.\nLife\nPrabhu Narain was born in 1921 to Sheetal Prasad Singh also known as Shital Mahto and Champa Devi in a Koeri family, in a village called Marar in Khagaria district of Bihar. He was an agitator from his early days and used to work for the right of agricultural labourers in his village. He was often also involved in protesting against their employers for the fair wages. His primary education was completed at Ramganj while he completed his middle school education from Shyamlal High school. He was married to Siya Devi at a young age and during his martyrdom his wife was pregnant. She gave birth to his son who was named Himmat Singh.\nFor higher education, he moved to Banaras Hindu University. During this period there used to be a special class on Indian national movement in the university to bring more and more educated youths in the India's freedom struggle. Narain was motivated to join Indian independence movement at the call of Mahatma Gandhi and in August 1942, he moved from Banaras to Khagaria to take part in Quit India movement.\nOn 13 August 1942, he was joined by another independence activist Bharat Poddar who was a resident of Thana Chowk in Khagaria in the protest of 1942. The protesters were led by Narain, and they marched towards police station near Mungeria square to unfurl the national flag of India in order to show their resentment to colonial rule. At Benjamin square, they were joined by activist Motilal and  Munshilal Verma. As the protesters marched forward, British Indian police fired upon them, killing Narain. After the news of his death spread, the commoners gathered from the nearby villages and in association with the protesters, they looted the Olapur police station.\nCommemoration\nIn commemoration of Narain's role in 1942 movement, the place of his death was named as Shaheed Prabhu Narain square upon his name and a life size statue of Narain has been established there.\nSee also\nNanak Bheel\n",

    "2019 book about Henrik Ibsen by Sverre M\u00f8rkhagen\nIbsen: \"... den m\u00e6rkelige mand\" is a biography of Henrik Ibsen, written by Sverre M\u00f8rkhagen and published by Gyldendal Norsk Forlag in 2019. The book sparked intense debate among Ibsen scholars and the public in 2019. Shortly after its publication, it received a very positive review in Dagbladet and was awarded a prize that called the book the \"ultimate Ibsen biography.\" However, later in the fall of 2019, it was heavily criticized by leading Ibsen scholars who argued that the book presented an outdated and inaccurate portrayal of Ibsen, ignored recent Ibsen scholarship, and contained unsustainable conjecture and factual errors. J\u00f8rgen Haave and other Ibsen researchers described the book as a setback for the academic study of Henrik Ibsen's life and work, due to its recycling of myths and misunderstandings.\nContent and reception\nThe book is a comprehensive biography that aims to present Ibsen's entire life and work. Each chapter is named after a chapter in Ibsen's play Peer Gynt.\nThe book was the subject of significant debate among academics in 2019. After its release, it received positive reviews from non-specialists, including a very favorable review by Marius Wulfsberg in Dagbladet, where the book was described as \"a masterpiece.\" That same fall, M\u00f8rkhagen received the Riksm\u00e5l Society's Literature Prize for the book, and the jury described it as \"the ultimate Ibsen biography.\" However, later in the fall, the criticism from academic circles studying Henrik Ibsen's life and work grew stronger.\nIbsen researcher and director of the Henrik Ibsen Museum in Skien, J\u00f8rgen Haave, was critical of the book and argued that it presented a highly misleading image of Ibsen, recycled old myths that had been debunked, contained many errors and misunderstandings, and did not incorporate Ibsen research from the last decade before publication, including the book Familien Ibsen (2017). Haave called the book \"a speculative and sloppy story\" that \"is a depressing setback for Ibsen research,\" giving \"a completely wrong impression of Henrik Ibsen's life and work.\" According to Haave, the book undermines efforts to document and communicate Ibsen's biography due to its careless use of sources, providing an \"uncritical and imprecise\" recounting that the author \"remembers reading and 'enriches' stories with a good dose of his own invention.\"\nA group of genealogists investigated the book's claim that Ibsen fathered a daughter with a thirteen-year-old and demonstrated that the claim was false.\nIbsen scholar and director of the Ibsen Museum in Oslo, Erik Henning Edvardsen, wrote that \"M\u00f8rkhagen's attempt to write an Ibsen biography has so far sparked debate around the peculiar idea of opening the possibility that Henrik Ibsen as a 15-year-old could have impregnated a 13-year-old girl.  M\u00f8rkhagen retrieves all the missteps found in the secondary literature.  Small and large blunders follow each other quickly throughout the work.  It's incomprehensible that Gyldendal alone trusted the author's judgment and released the work without any quality control from an Ibsen scholar.\" Edvardsen wrote that M\u00f8rkhagen \"exclusively revitalizes outdated errors and has no idea what has happened in Ibsen research since 1977.\"\nHistory professor and Ibsen researcher Narve Fuls\u00e5s wrote that \"Sverre M\u00f8rkhagen does not let research or new sources stand in the way of his good story about a suffering Henrik Ibsen.   primarily a disappointing testimony to the failure of humanistic Ibsen scholarship. Here, everything seems to have bounced off the narrative that M\u00f8rkhagen has already decided on.\"\nThe Aftenposten reviewer, literature professor Henning Howlid W\u00e6rp, was critical of the book and argued that it lacked a clear purpose: \" the biography with the assertion that Ibsen's authorship must not 'end up in the shadow of oblivion.' That is hardly a risk.\"\nM\u00f8rkhagen rejected the criticism, stating, \"I don't fully agree with the fact dogmatism that characterizes parts of the Ibsen community.\" In an interview, he said the Ibsen scholars \"have decided to bark and snap at me with astonishing rage.\" Later, M\u00f8rkhagen stated that he and Ivo de Figueiredo represented \"a bolder Ibsen tradition.\" Ibsen researcher Ivo de Figueiredo distanced himself from this, stating that \"unless you miss more Trump rhetoric in historical writing, it is difficult to see Sverre M\u00f8rkhagen's confrontation with Ibsen research's 'fact-based dogmatism' as progress.\" He agreed with Haave's points but felt the criticism of M\u00f8rkhagen's book was so aggressive \"you'd think the Brekkeparken Museum was under siege.\" Figueiredo also noted that Wulfsberg's review of the book \"makes you wonder what kind of research standards are upheld at the National Library.\"\n",

He was a martyr of the late Qing dynasty revolution, also a descendant of the Ming dynasty general Shi Kefa. In October 1900, he made an unsuccessful attempt to bomb the highest-ranking official of Guangdong, for which he was arrested and executed by Qing authorities.\nLife\nShi was born into a wealthy bureaucratic family, with ancestors from Shanyin, Zhejiang. He had one brother and one sister. Despite being frail in his youth, he was intelligent and fond of learning, enjoying reading books. In 1898, he enrolled in the Christian Gezhi Academy, where he received a Western-style education. In 1899, he joined the Revive China Society through the introduction of a Professor from Gezhi Academy and met Sun Yat-sen in Yokohama, Japan. Upon returning to China, he started to organize revolutionary activities in the Hunan region and planned an uprising.\nShi's statue in his graveyard\nIn 1900, the Boxer Rebellion erupted in northern China which led to the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance. Revolutionary forces, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, seized the opportunity presented by the chaos to launch uprisings. Zheng Shiliang initiated the Huizhou Uprising, while Shi Jianru raised funds in Guangzhou by mortgaging his own land to support the revolution. However, due to a lack of funds, the revolutionary forces in Guangzhou, led by Shi, were weak, prompting him to devise a big plan to gain influence. He considered assassinating the local Governor-General, De Shou, to support the Huizhou Uprising. Initially, he purchased 25 boxes of explosives, but they were seized by authorities. Later, he acquired 200 pounds of explosives. Under the name of his friend Song Shaodong, Shi rented a mansion behind De Shou's residence and dug a tunnel there to store the explosives.\nOn the night of October 26, 1900, Shi attempted to detonate the explosives. Due to a faulty fuse, they failed to explode. Then, in the early hours of October 30, he successfully detonated the explosives, causing several civilian casualties and damaging nearby buildings. However, the explosion didn't harm De Shou physically; it simply startled him awake by pushing him out of bed. This event astonished the public as well.\nLocal authorities swiftly launched an investigation and obtained information about Shi's whereabouts from one of his relatives, who feared being implicated in the case. Despite the risk, instead of fleeing, Shi returned to the site of the explosion to figure out why De Shou survived the attack. He was captured on his way to Hong Kong at the provincial dock in Guangzhou on October 31 and taken into custody. During interrogation, he endured severe torture, causing him to lose consciousness several times, yet he steadfastly refused to divulge information about his accomplices.\nOn November 8, 1900, De Shou issued the order for Shi's execution. The next day, November 9, Shi was escorted to the execution ground near Tianzi Wharf in Guangzhou, where he was beheaded at the young age of 21. As a warning to the public, his head was displayed at the site of the explosion.

    "\nThe Dark Gods or Dark Ones, also known as the Heptad, were a group of malevolent deities from the religions of the ancient Anatolian peoples.\nName\nThe Dark Ones\nThis group of deities was known in Luwian as DINGIRME\u0160 Marw\u0101inzi (\ud808\udc2d\ud808\ude28\ud808\udf0d\ud808\ude25\ud808\ude7f\ud808\udc00\ud808\udd54\ud808\udf63) and \u1d30Marwayanza (\ud808\udc2d\ud808\ude25\ud808\ude7f\ud808\udd40\ud808\udc2d\ud808\udf5d), and in Hittite as \u1d30Markuwaya\u0161 (\ud808\udc2d\ud808\ude25\ud808\uddaa\ud808\ude7f\ud808\udd40\ud808\udc38), all meaning lit.\u2009'the Dark Ones'.\nThe Heptad\nThe Dark Gods were also referred to in Hittite as \u1d30\u0160\u0113pitta\u0161 (\ud808\udc2d\ud809\udc0c\ud809\udc0c\ud808\udc49 and \ud808\udc2d\ud808\udeba\ud808\udc8a\ud808\udd41\ud808\udc49\ud808\udc09\ud808\udeeb\ud808\udc38), that is the Heptad. \u1d30\u0160\u0113pitta\u0161 was a loanword from the Akkadian il\u016b sebitti, meaning lit.\u2009'seven gods', due to its similarity for the Proto-Indo-European term for this number, *sept\u1e3f\u0325.\nIn the ritual text KUB 59.26, this group of gods was referred to as \"the Dark Heptad\" (Hittite: \ud808\udc2d\ud809\udc0c\ud809\udc0c\ud808\udc49\ud808\udc2d\ud808\ude25\ud808\uddaa\ud808\ude7f\ud808\udd40\ud808\udc38, romanized:\u00a0\u1d30\u0160\u0113pitta\u0161 \u1d30Markuwaya\u0161).\nHistory\nThe Dark Gods and the plague-god Iyarri to whom they were associated might have originated from the Babylonian Erra and the Sebitti who accompanied him, with whom they were identical.\nDespite their foreign origin, the Dark Gods and Iyarri had cult places primarily in Central Anatolia and the regions inhabited by Luwians, and Iyarri appeared in Anatolian theophoric names, thus attesting that the people who gave these names saw these deities as being part of their own culture, thus showing that they had become firmly rooted in the Hittite and Luwian religions and had not been transmitted to the Anatolian peoples through the intermediary of Hurrian religion.\nAttestations\nThe Dark Gods are attested in the Hittite Empire, where they featured as assistants of the god Iyarri.\nThe Dark Gods were also mentioned in the rituals of Malli and U\u1e2b\u1e2bamuwa from Arzawa.\nThe Heptad was also present in the religion of the Hurrian populations of Kizzuwatna:\none ritual text mentioning them as part of the entourage of the gods Te\u0161\u0161ub, \u0160arruma and T\u0113nu, and where they were referred to as the \"male gods of \u0160arruma\" (\ud808\udc2d\ud808\ude28\ud808\udf0d\ud808\uddfd\ud808\ude28\ud808\udf0d\ud808\udc2d\ud808\ude17\ud808\ude20\ud808\udead);\nanother text mentioned a Heptad of I\u0161tar (\ud808\udc2d\ud809\udc0c\ud809\udc0c\ud808\udc49\ud808\udc2d\ud808\ude39);\none text describing offerings of birds and breads mentioned the Heptad and the Hurrian god \u1e2aa\u0161ulat\u1e2bi;\none text reflecting cross-influences between Hittite and Hurrian cults mentioned the Heptad together with the Tutelary God of Tauri\u0161a;\ntwo fragmentary texts possibly recording a Syro-Hurrian myth mentioned \"the daughter of the Heptad\" (\ud808\udead\ud808\udc2d\ud809\udc0c\ud809\udc0c\ud808\udc49\ud808\udf09\ud808\udea9).\nCult\nNature\nThe name \"the Dark Ones\" not only assigned an awe-inspiring appearance to this group of deities, but also ascribed to them a negative role. This is also visible in how one text referred to them as the \"terrifying Heptad\" (Hittite: \ud808\udd29\ud808\udc7a\ud808\udcb5\ud808\udc8a\ud808\udf0d\ud808\udc2d\ud809\udc0c\ud809\udc0c\ud808\udc49, romanized:\u00a0\u1e2baduga\u0113\u0161 \u1d30\u0160epittaes) and another text called them the \"evil Heptad\" (Hittite: \ud808\udd37\ud808\udf0b\ud808\ude7f\ud808\udc0a\ud808\ude7a\ud808\udc8a\ud808\udf0d\ud808\udc2d\ud809\udc0c\ud809\udc0c\ud808\udc49, romanized:\u00a0\u1e2b\u016bwappa\u0113\u0161 \u1d30\u0160epittae\u0161).\nThe Dark Gods were conceived as consisting of 14 male deities, hence why their name was written in cuneiform using the Sumerogram \u1d30IMIN.IMIN.BI, where the duplication of the cuneiform sign for the number 7 (\ud809\udc0c) represented a double Heptad.\nFunction\nAs suggested by their collective name, the Dark Gods were considered to have a malevolent nature, which is also attested through their function in the U\u1e2b\u1e2bamuwa ritual from Arzawa, where they represented pernicious forces.\nIn the text KUB 17.16 I, describing a ritual to be performed when humans, cattle and sheep are dying frightfully, several gods are invoked while the Dark Gods are considered to be responsible for the plague.\nAssociation with other deities\nDuring the Hittite Empire, the Dark Gods were associated with the god Iyarri who, like the Greek Apollo, shot his arrows at those he hates. In the Dandanku ritual, meant to prevent the plague in an army by convincing Iyarri to attack enemy countries instead of the Land of \u1e2aatti, the Heptad were his assistants as the Dark Gods of Iyarri.\nThe Dark Gods were not only associated with deities having negative roles, and in the ritual text KBo 34.48 they were associated with the Tutelary God of the Hunting Bag to eliminate evil, although these deities had different roles, since the performers of the ritual sought, during it, to obtain favour from the Tutelary God of the Hunting Bag but to keep the Dark Gods, referred to in the text as the \"terrifying Heptad\" (\ud808\udd29\ud808\udc7a\ud808\udcb5\ud808\udc8a\ud808\udf0d\ud808\udc2d\ud809\udc0c\ud809\udc0c\ud808\udc49, \u1e2baduga\u0113s \u1d30\u0160epittaes), at bay.\nIn the ritual text Vs. I 16, the Dark Gods were associated with several solar deities, including the Sun, the Sun deity of the Ominous Signs, and the Sun-goddess of the Earth, while the Dark Gods themselves appeared as the Heptad of the Sun (\ud808\udc2d\ud809\udc0c\ud809\udc0c\ud808\udc49\ud808\udead\ud808\udc2d\ud808\udf13).\nA Heptad of Tar\u1e2bunna (\ud808\udead\ud808\udc2d\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udc2d\ud809\udc0c\ud809\udc0c\ud808\udc49) also appears in a list structured like a kaluti- of the Hurrian tradition of Kizzuwatna, which itself describes a late ritual connected to the Hattian myth of the Moon falling from Heaven out of fear of the thunder, lightning and rains of the storm-god. The Heptad also appears in the AN.TA\u1e2a.\u0160UMSAR festival, where the Anatolian god Tar\u1e2bunna and the Hurrian god Te\u0161\u0161ub merge with each other, and during which offerings are given to the cart, weapons, thunder, clouds, dew, rains, father-gods, and vizier of Te\u0161\u0161ub, as well as to ",
    "\nBritish black metal band\nUnderdark are a British black metal band from Nottingham, England, formed in 2015 by guitarists Ollie Jones and Adam Kinson and drummer Dan Hallam. The band's current lineup consists of Jones, Kinson, bassist Stephen \"Stig\" Waterfield, vocalist Abi Vasquez and drummer Dan Blackmore. The band's sound has been categorized under the \"post-black metal\" label. The band's anti-fascist beliefs, which they have held since their inception, have led to them being associated with the \"anti-fascist black metal\" and Red and Anarchist Black Metal (RABM) movements, although they do not consider themselves to be a \"political band\".\nUnderdark released their debut EP, Mourning Cloak (2016), with original vocalist Max Speelman. Speelman quit the band was replaced by Vasquez shortly after the recording of its debut album, Our Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry, in 2019; the album was not released until 2021 due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Their second album and first with Blackmore, Managed Decline, was released through Church Road Records on 24 November 2023.\nHistory\nFormation and early releases (2015\u20132018)\nUnderdark were formed in 2015 when guitarists Ollie Jones and Adam Kinson (of Statutes) approached drummer Dan Hallam (of Castaway) about the possibility of starting a black metal band \"similar to Deafheaven with scream influences such as Envy\". The members all came from \"hardcore or hardcore-adjacent\" musical backgrounds; Hallam had little-to-no experience with black metal prior to joining the band. They then recruited vocalist Max Speelman, whom they had seen perform live once, before recruiting bassist Stephen \"Stig\" Waterfield. The band takes its name from the Funeral Diner album The Underdark (2005).\nThe band's music started off as \"purely Deafheaven and Envy worship\", according to Hallam, and gradually began experimenting with more atmospheric textures drawn from post-rock and post-metal. In 2016, the band self-released their debut EP, Mourning Cloak, which was distributed through the DIY record labels Adorno, Slime Citadel, Third-I-Rex and Sell Your Soul. Underdark toured heavily throughout 2017, including a weekender tour with Nihility. In February 2018, the band released a split 7\" single with Antre, which entered the top-selling black metal chart on Bandcamp. In July 2018, the band embarked on their first European tour, before playing on the \"New Blood\" stage of the Bloodstock Open Air festival in August.\nOur Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry (2019\u20132022)\nUnderdark began writing their debut album, Our Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry, in 2018. It was initially planned as an EP but was expanded into an album over the course of a year. The band recorded, mixed and mastered the album in January 2019. Not long after its recording, however, Speelman quit Underdark. \"There were too many conflicting ideals and it all came to a head at one point and we just parted ways\", Hallam said. The band were nevertheless \"gutted\" by his exit and briefly considered breaking up, but decided to continue \"cause we've worked so hard towards it.\" They soon began advertising for a new vocalist, and in June 2019, recruited Abi Vasquez, formerly of Yuri. Vasquez, who had been on a hiatus from music due to surgery before auditioning for Underdark, first met most of the band's members whilst she was working as a booking agent in Leicester; Hallam had also played shows with Yuri when he was in an emo band. Underdark announced Vasquez's addition to their line-up in September 2019, hours before her first performance with the band. Vasquez was made to re-record the album's vocals with her own lyrics, over the band's already completed music. Afterwards, the band had the album remixed and remastered.\nUnderdark had again finished Our Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry by March 2020, but were forced to delay its release due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 30 October 2020, the band released a limited edition cassette single, featuring a cover of The Cure's \"Plainsong\" and a re-recording of Mourning Cloak track \"With Bruised and Bloodied Feet\", as a way of introducing Vasquez and the direction of their forthcoming debut album to the public. It was released through Surviving Sounds in Europe and Red Nebula in North America, and limited to 50 copies per label. On 11 May 2021, Underdark announced that Our Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry would be released on 30 July 2021. The band signed with three record labels to distribute the album; Surviving Sounds in the United Kingdom, Through Love in Europe and Tridroid in North America. The album received positive reviews from critics. Underdark embarked on a small tour of the United Kingdom following its release, and played one-off shows opening for Dawn Ray'd and Conan. In March 2022, Underdark and Mountain Caller supported Svalbard on select dates of their UK tour for that month. The band were due to perform at Cult of Luna's Beyond the Redshift Festival in London that same mont",

The temple comes under Ramanuja tradition in Hinduism.\nDescription\nThe Janaki Sthan Mandir at Janaki Sthan in Sitamarhi is much older than the Janaki Temple in Janakpur. According to a court document, in 1599, land of Janaki Sthan was donated to the Janaki temple in Sitamarhi city by the King Narpati Singh of Raj Darbhanga. Its founder is believed to be Hiraram Das of Revasa Math of Rajasthan. But according to a case filed in Patna High Court in 1923 regarding this Math, the name of its first Mahant was Hiram and he was said to be a resident of Misraula village of Shahabad.\nDisputes between Janaki Sthan and Punauradham\nSince the British era, there has been a controversy over the manifestation ( birth ) place of Goddess Sita. Some scholars say that the birthplace of Goddess Sita is Janaki Sthan located in Sitamarhi city and some scholars say that Punauradham is the birthplace of the Goddess Sita. On the both places there are Janaki temples as well as Kunds. The Kund at Punauradham is called as Sita Kund or Janaki Kund and the Kund at Janaki Sthan is called as Urvija Kund. According to Mahant Vinod Das, Janaki Sthan is the manifestation place of the Goddess Sita. There was a tradition of Guru-Shishya at this place. After the death of Guru, Shishya was assigned as Mahant. After the death of a certain Mahant during British India, two of his disciples clashed for claiming to be the Mahant of the temple. Even the initiative of the local saints could not resolve the issue. It is said that the matter went to court. The Privy Council of London gave verdicted in the favour of Janaki Sthan as the manifestation place of Goddess Sita. Then the second disciple went to Pundarik Ashram at Punauradham and built a temple there. This temple at the Pundarik Ashram later became Ram Janaki Mandir. It is said that sage Pundarik had an ashram in Punaura. He used to meditate here. In the 19th century, the Birla Group wanted to renovate the Janaki Sthan Mandir, but the then Mahant did not allow this to happen fearing that the temple would be named Birla Mandir. Then Birla's team reached Punauradham and renovated the Ram Janaki Mandir there.\n",

De Zulueta was a chamberlain and Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Francisco de As\u00eds, Duke of C\u00e1diz, the King consort of Spain, and a member of the Senate of Spain until the Revolution in 1868.

    "\nThe Battles for Murzuch, or the Reconquest of Fezzan, was a series of operations in the region today known as Fezzan. Italian soldiers and local fighters fought for who would have control over the region and the city of Murzuch, and the Italians were eventually victorious.\nBackground\nHaving appointed general Emilio De Bono as Minister of the Colonies in January 1929, the two Libyan colonies (Tripolitania and Cyrenaica) were reunited under a single governor, marshal Pietro Badoglio. He began his governance by launching a proclamation to the populations which remained among the rebel ranks to choose between submission to the Government or execution. At the same time, he based his action on the principle \u00abto pacify the colonies it is essential first of all to occupy the entire country\u00bb.\nClashes occurred in Umm Melah, in the far north of Fezzan, where a large enemy garrison was destroyed and, in May, towards Bir Sciueref, where another large group of rebels suffered the same fate. At the end of May 1929, the overall situation in Tripolitania now allowed the Governor to prepare operations for the establishment of control over Fezzan.\nCampaign preparations and first clashes\nAfter the spring 1929 operations in Ghibla, many rebel groups had taken refuge in Fezzan, headed in the western part by Salem en Nebi and Mohammed ben Hassel and in the eastern part by the Seif en Nasser brothers. Marshal Badoglio's plan was to advance into Fezzan with the following concept:\n (in Italian) \"Affrontare e liquidare successivamente, uno alla volta, sempre quando possibile, i vari nuclei in cui appariva frazionato l\u2019avversario, e sempre in condizioni di avere il sopravvento anche nel caso sfavorevole che il nemico riuscisse ad opporci una massa unica.\"\nThe logistical preparation was based on the assumption of the complete occupation of Fezzan: the main base was located at the entrance to Fezzan, in Hon (Wadi al Shatii District), the three subsidiary bases were in Gheriat, Bir esc-Sciueref and Derg (Jabal al Gharbi District). These bases were supposed to aid the units during their concentration and provide them, upon departure, with the necessary means for a month's autonomy. Road communications up to the bases were improved, so as to make them suitable for the transit of vehicles. The gathering in Sciueref took place secretly in November. On 25 November General Graziani assumed command of the troops which were formed as follows:\nColumn of the Sciueref led by Amedeo D'Aosta made up of:\n1st Saharan group (two Saharan groups and a Saharan artillery section), under the orders of lieutenant Ferrari Orsi;\n2nd Saharan group (formation like the previous one), under the orders of lieutenant Amato.\nThe column was to be followed by a caravan of 700 camels, with portions of the various services, two months of food and 17 days of water for the 260 kilometers of desert to be overcome.\nEastern column led by colonel Cubeddu made up of a self-supported Eritrean battalion, an armored machine gun squadron and a maneuver group (286 trucks) to constitute the future Brak base;\nDerg column led by lieutenant Colonel Moramarco made up of a Saharan group, a Meharist nucleus, a Saharan artillery section and adequate logistical elements.\nOn the command banner was the motto: \u00abUsque ad finem\u00bb (in Latin: Until the End).\nPietro Badoglio and Amedeo d'Aosta in Murzuch talking about the campaign.\nAn Italian raised up on a building in Murzuch.\nThe Sciueref column arrived in Brak on 5 December after crossing 265 kilometers of desert without any incident: the inhabitants of Brak made an act of submission to general Amedeo. The Italians found and arranged the tomb of captain De Dominicis, who fell in Maharuga fifteen years earlier. In Brak the Italians left a military garrison entrusted to colonel Natale.\nBattle for Murzuch, Brak and Sebha\nAfter the occupations of Brak and Sebha, on 14 December, by colonel Cubeddu and of the oasis of Umm el Araneb\u00a0 and Uau el Kebir by generals Graziani and Badoglio, respectively on 8 January 1930 and on 13 January 1830, troops led by Amedeo D'Aosta, after a light battle, successfully occupied Murzuch. The operations in Fezzan finally ended when Italian soldiers reached the Chad\u2013Libya border on 20 February 1930, and raised colonial flags on centres like Tummo.\n",

    "\nHereford United 1972\u201373 football season\nThe 1972\u201373 season was the 43rd season of competitive football played by Hereford United Football Club and their first in the Football League following election from non-league at the end of the previous season. The club competed in Division Four, as well as the League Cup, FA Cup and Welsh Cup.\nBackground\nHereford ended the 1971\u201372 Southern League season  as runners-up, two points behind champions Chelmsford City. They also reached the final of the Southern League Cup and enjoyed a run to the fourth round of the FA Cup which included a famous win over Newcastle United that put the club in the national spotlight. Hereford applied for election to the Football League and were duly voted in at the expense of Barrow.\nSummary\nHereford made their league bow in a 1\u20130 defeat away to Colchester United. The following weekend, Kenny Wallace scored their first league goal in a 3\u20130 home win over Reading, although the honour of Hereford's first scorer in a competitive match as a league club went to George Johnston in a midweek League Cup defeat to Aston Villa.\nAfter 14 matches, Hereford had notched up only one further win and lay 21st in the division, but in their next two matches, they doubled their tally by beating Northampton Town and leaders Mansfield Town. This started a 14 match unbeaten run that saw Hereford surge up the table to become promotion contenders. They maintained this good form, losing only three of their last 17 matches, but still needed at least a point from their final match against Crewe Alexandra to guarantee promotion. In the event, Hereford managed a 1\u20130 win courtesy of a goal by David Jenkins.\nHereford's average home crowd of nearly 9000 was the highest in the Fourth Division (Reading's 5521 being the next highest) and higher than all bar six clubs from the Third Division. They lost only once at Edgar Street and dropped just a single point from their last 17 home matches.\nThis was the only season at the club for goalkeeper David Icke.

    "\nAlfonso Merry del Val y Zulueta, 1st Marquess of Merry del Val GCVO CvNSC (20 April 1864 \u2013 27 May 1943) was a Spanish diplomat.\nEarly life\nMerry del Val was born on 20 April 1864 at 59 Queen Anne Street in Marylebone, London. He was the eldest of four sons born to Sof\u00eda Josefa de Zulueta (1839\u20131925) and Rafael Carlos Merry del Val. Among his younger siblings, all of whom were born in London, was Rafael Merry del Val, who became Cardinal Secretary of State to Pope Pius X.

During the First World War, he worked in the United States as a poster designer for the American war effort.\nBiography\nBorn in Turnhout, Jozef Paul Verrees studied architectural drawing at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp (Nationaal Hoger Instituut voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen, NHISKA) from 1906 to 1908 under the direction of Juliaan De Vriendt (1842\u20131935) and Charles Mertens (1865\u20131919), as well as engraving in the workshop of Piet Verhaert, then in that of Frans Lauwers (1854\u20131931), who taught him the art of etching, where Verrees would prove himself remarkably gifted. Verrees worked alongside Lauwers until 1911. He collaborated with the Flemish newspaper Ons Volk Ontwaakt.\nIn May 1914, he presented his engravings at the triennial salon of the General Exhibition of Fine Arts at the Palais du Cinquantenaire in Brussels. After the start of the First World War, wounded during the first combats, he was evacuated to Scotland where he crossed paths with Frank Brangwyn. Verrees then left for the United States. He became known as an etcher by joining the Brooklyn Society of Etchers in 1915, as well as the Chicago Society of Etchers. He provides illustrations for American periodicals such as The Century Magazine and The Garden Magazine. From April 1917, recruited by the Division of Pictorial Publicity, he executed propaganda posters targeting Germany and serving to mobilize the American war effort (Join the Air Service and serve in France in 1917; What Are You Doing? Can Vegetables, Fruit and the Kaiser Too in 1918 for the National War Garden Commission). All his work is signed \"J. Paul Verrees\".\nAfter the war, he returned to Belgium, settled in Westmalle, and became professor and director in 1929 of the Turnhout art school. Verrees died in 1942.\nGallery\nThem Others (1917)\nJoin the air service and serve in France (1917)\nCan Vegetables, Fruit and the Kaiser Too\nNotes and references\n^ (Dutch) Gaston Durnez, De Standaard.

    "Lifeboat station in Tyne and Wear, England\nCullercoats Lifeboat Station is located on the north side of Cullercoats Harbour, in the town of Cullercoats, North Tyneside, in the county of Tyne and Wear.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS) in 1852, which became the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1854.\nThe Cullercoats RNLI station currently operates a B-class (Atlantic 85) Inshore lifeboat Daddy's Girl (B-935), on station since 2022.\nHistory\nIn 1852, Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, president of the RNIPLS, made funds available for the provision of a lifeboat at Cullercoats. A 36-foot long, 15-foot wide, stone-built boathouse was constructed, also at the expense of the Duke. A modified lifeboat, based on the prize-winning design of James Beeching, was created by James Peake, Master Shipwright at Woolwich Royal Naval Dockyard, and a carriage to transport the boat was designed by Col. Colquhoun, RA, Master-General of Ordnance. Both lifeboat and carriage arrived in Cullercoats on 3 September 1852, the boat being named Percy in honour of the Duke.\nBy 1858, Percy was found to be suffering from dry rot. A replacement 32-foot 10-oared Peake-class lifeboat was ordered from Forrestt of Limehouse, London, costing \u00a3174, and requiring a larger carriage, costing a further \u00a380-5s-0d. Costs were again funded by the Duke of Northumberland, and the boat was once again named Percy.\nA replacement boathouse was constructed in 1866 to accommodate the larger 33-foot lifeboat Palmerston. Thirty years later, a third boathouse was constructed in 1896. A brick structure, it was built on the site of the 1866 boathouse, and cost \u00a3750. Funded by the Co-operative wholesale society, who had also funded a lifeboat Co-operator No.1 (ON 5) in 1884, it was opened on 8 August 1896 by Mr Tweedell, chairman of the Newcastle branch of the Society. It is still in use to this day, and is grade II listed by Historic England.\nThe era of Pulling and Sailing lifeboats (those with oars and sails) at Cullercoats came to an end in 1937, with the arrival of a Liverpool-class motor-powered lifeboat (which would also still have sails), the Richard Silver Oliver (ON 794). The boat had a single 35\u00a0hp engine, delivering a speed of 7.33 knots, and cost \u00a33,684. After 85 years, this would also be the first non-self-righting lifeboat at Cullercoats, which 2 years later would prove very costly.\nOn a training exercise in 1939, the lifeboat was capsized off Sharpness Point. 6 crewmen were lost, including the Coxswain and the Honorary Secretary. The remaining crew refused to use another non-self-righting lifeboat, and the station was closed until the arrival of a self-righting boat in 1940.\nFollowing a coastal review in 1968, with All-weather lifeboats at flanking stations Blyth and Tynemouth, and with a D-class Inshore lifeboat at Cullercoats since 1965, the RNLI decided to withdraw the Cullercoats All-weather lifeboat. 37-08 Sir James Knott (ON 975) was formally withdrawn on 4 May 1969, being transferred to the Relief fleet, and then to Redcar in 1972. Over the following years, the D-class lifeboats would be replaced with a larger twin engine C-class lifeboat, and then in 1991, a B-class (Atlantic 21).\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Cullercoats.\nRNLI Silver Medal\nAlexander Donkin, 1827\nThe Medal for this service was stolen and re-issued as a new Medal in 1833.\nJohn Redford, Coxswain - 1853\nAndrew Taylor, Coxswain - 1898\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nMajor William Adamson, Honorary Secretary - 1886\nBrian Gould, Helmsman - 1995\nRobert Oliver, Helmsman - 1996\nRobert Oliver, Helmsman - 2012\nThe Walter and Elizabeth Groombridge Award 1996(for the outstanding inshore lifeboat rescue of the year)\nRobert Oliver, Helmsman - 1997\nA Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman of the Institution\nMark Charlton, crew member - 1996\nDavid Pendlington, crew member - 1996\nRobert Oliver - 2010\nPeter Clark - 2010\nGrahame Wood - 2010\nGary Hawksford - 2010\nGrahame Wood, crew member - 2012\nStephen Potts, crew member - 2012\nExceptional First Aid Certificate\nRoss Dun, crew member - 2011\nGrahame Wood, crew member - 2011\nMember, Order of the British Empire (MBE)\nRaymond James Taylor, Honorary Secretary - 1995\nBritish Empire Medal\nGeoffrey Cowan, Community Safety Officer - 2020\nRoll of honour\nIn memory of those lost whilst serving Cullercoats lifeboat.\nLiverpool-class lifeboat Richard Silver Oliver (ON 794), a non-self-righting lifeboat, capsized on exercise - 22 April 1939\nGeorge Brunton, Coxswain\nJ Redford Armstrong, Second Coxswain\nJ Leonard Abel, Motor Mechanic\nJohn Heddon Scott, Assistant Mechanic\nLt.

    "\nThe Russian submarine Morzh (Russian: \u041c\u043e\u0440\u0436, lit.\u2009'walrus') was the lead ship of the Morzh class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. The submarine was laid down in August 1913 and was launched in September 1913, though it was not completed until April 1915. \nBuilt for the Black Sea Fleet, it saw action during World War I, notably by intercepting Turkish coal shipments between Constantinople and Zonguldak, and on one occasion nearly hitting the German cruiser Goeben with torpedoes. Morzh was lost at sea near the Bosporus in May 1917, most likely destroyed by a naval mine, making it the only submarine of its class to have been lost in combat. It was credited with sinking or capturing 30 ships during its career, for a total tonnage of 4,907\u00a0gross register tons\u00a0(GRT).\nDesign and construction\nMorzh under construction.\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Morzh-class boats and three Narval-class. The naval engineer Ivan Bubnov was the designer of the Morzh class and developed it from his earlier submarine Akula, which was considered to be the most advanced of the Russian submarines at the time. In the years before the 1911 program, there was debate in the Imperial Russian Navy on whether to purchase and build the submarines designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard, or a foreign inspired design, based on the popular Holland type, which became known as the Narval class. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class.\nThe Morzh-class submarines were well-armed for the time, having one deck gun, four internal torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars. However, the vessel had numerous shortcomings. It suffered from having only a single hull, lacking bulkheads, having a slow diving time of 3+1\u20442 minutes due to poor ballast tank venting, and a diving depth of only 25 fathoms (150\u00a0ft; 46\u00a0m). An additional problem was that twin 1,140 horsepower (850\u00a0kW) diesel engines to power all three Morzh-class boats had been ordered from Germany, but were not delivered by the time World War I broke out. They had to be replaced by severely underpowered engines from the Amur River gunboats, each of which delivered only 250 horsepower (190\u00a0kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30\u00a0km/h; 18\u00a0mph) surface speed could not be attained. The designed 12-knot (22\u00a0km/h; 14\u00a0mph) underwater speed also could not be attained due to a poorly designed hull shape, which was more like that of a surface vessel than a submarine. The construction of all three submarines began on 25 June 1911 and took place at the Nikolayev department of the Baltic Yard, which was created specifically to build the Morzh class. Some of the components were made in Saint Petersburg before being sent to Nikolayev to be assembled.\nThe lead submarine of the class, Morzh, was launched in September 1913. Its engines were not installed until March 1915, and the sea trials were not complete until the end of April, at which point Morzh joined the Black Sea Fleet. This date made it the last boat in its class to be completed and enter service. At this point they were considered to be the best submarines in the Black Sea Fleet.\nWorld War I service\nMorzh towing the captured Belouzar into Sevastopol\nAround the time that the submarine was completed in early 1915, the Black Sea Fleet had been ordered to attack the Bosporus in preparation for landing ground troops there in support of the British and the French during the Gallipoli campaign. The other two boats of its class, Nerpa and Tyulen, were already active with the rest of the fleet in blockading the Bosporus to prevent coal shipments between Constantinople and the coal producing region near Zonguldak, about 150 miles away. The German commanding admiral in the region, Wilhelm Souchon, thought that Russian submarines could potentially cut off the Ottoman Navy from its main supply of coal, though initially they did not have that much success. Morzh joined its sister ships in patrolling the waters near the Bosporus. In July 1915, it accompanied the submarine minelayer Krab, which was also recently completed, to the opening of the strait to lay naval mines for the German cruiser Goeben. Krab had some engine problems during the mission and had to be towed back to base by Morzh.\nIn August 1915 Morzh carried out ",

    "Cistercian monastery in Oliwa, Poland\nCistercian monastery in Oliwa (1765)\nThe Oliwa Abbey was the Cistercian monastic community in Oliwa (now a district of Gda\u0144sk), the oldest monastic establishment in Gda\u0144sk Pomerania, which existed continuously from 1188 to 1831, and from 1466 to 1772 consistently sided with the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in its ongoing disputes with Gda\u0144sk. The monastery buildings were repeatedly destroyed by pagan Prussians, Brandenburgers, Teutonic Knights, Hussites, Swedes, Russians, and the people of Gda\u0144sk itself. In the twilight years of its existence, the abbey became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772 following the First Partition of Poland. Due to Prussian dissolution policies, the Cistercian order was abolished in 1831.\nEstablishment\nFrom the mid-12th century, numerous Cistercian monasteries were established in the Polish lands, especially in Greater Poland, Pomerania, western Lesser Poland, and Silesia: \u0141ekno (1153), Lubi\u0105\u017c (1163), Ko\u0142bacz (1173), L\u0105d (1173), Sulej\u00f3w (1176), W\u0105chock (1179), Koprzywnica (1185), Mogi\u0142a (1222), Henryk\u00f3w (1227), and others. Somewhat later, a few Cistercian convents were established: Trzebnica (1203), O\u0142obok (1211), and Owi\u0144ska (1250).\nThe composition of the convents was overwhelmingly foreign. The Cistercians of Lesser Poland originated from Morimond in Burgundy (now in Champagne), and until the late Middle Ages, French and Italians predominated here. In the convents in other regions, there were mostly Germans \u2013 only the citizens of Cologne were admitted to the Greater Polish \u0141ekno, L\u0105d, or Obra (1240) (a filial of the Cistercian abbey in Altenberg near Cologne). In Ko\u0142bacz and its subsequent filials, Danes dominated.\nWithout the orders \u2013 both in terms of secular and ecclesiastical authorities \u2013 the process of civilization and Christianization of the Polish territories would undoubtedly have proceeded much more slowly. The monks brought with them a broad knowledge of literature, architecture, agriculture, various crafts, and, above all, management. Their activities laid the foundation for the structure of the Piast states during the period of territorial fragmentation.\nThe idea of bringing the Cistercians to Pomerania is attributed in the chronicles of the Oliwa Abbey to the Gda\u0144sk duke Sobieslaw I. In reality, the founder was the son of Sobieslaw, Duke Sambor I, who in 1186 brought them from Ko\u0142bacz: The Pomeranian Duke Sambor settled the Cistercian order in a place called Oliwa. The group of monks was led by the Dane Bernard Dithard, who became the first abbot. The Ko\u0142bacz Abbey was a filial of the Danish Esrum Abbey, so the monks who came to Oliwa were probably mostly from Denmark.\nGate House, the former main gate of the monastery\nSide gate of the monastery\nOn 18 March 1188, the foundation act was ceremonially signed in Gda\u0144sk. The monastery received valuable privileges enabling it to derive income from fishing and mills on the Oliwa Stream. It also received several villages, including the one that the monks named: Olyva, ubi coenobium constructum est (English: Oliwa, where the community is being built). Among linguists, there has long been a dispute over the origin of this name, with most agreeing that the etymology should be sought in the Slavic name of the river O\u0142awa, mistakenly associated by the monks who did not know the old Kashubian language with an olive, and consequently with the Mount of Olives.\nThe original monastery consisted of only twelve monks. Therefore, they limited themselves to building a Romanesque oratory and wooden residential buildings. Only in the first half of the 13th century was the oratory adapted into a chancel, elongated chapels were added on both sides, characteristic of the Cistercian church in Fontenay, on the plans of which many Cistercian temples were modeled. At that time, the transept and the main body of the church were built, with a length of four bays of the current nave, as well as the first brick monastery buildings. Around 1300, the Church of St. James was also built, intended \u2013 as a parish church \u2013 for the local population.\nUnder the rule of the dukes of Pomerania\nFormer monastery granary \u2013 now home to the Ethnographic Museum\nAround 1195, the monks from the Oliwa Abbey were removed, and new ones were sent from Ko\u0142bacz; presumably, it was due to disciplinary issues. However, the abbey flourished, and the generous donations of the dukes meant that by the end of the 13th century, the Oliwa Abbey owned 50 villages, a fishing station on the now practically nonexistent Zaspa Lake with a fleet of 40 boats, as well as exclusive rights to use the Strzy\u017ca stream and have mills on it, not to mention tithes from tariffs and Gda\u0144sk taverns: decimam etiam de omnibus tabernis.\nSlaughter of monks by Prussians near Gda\u0144sk in 1226\nIn 1226, the monastery was plundered and burned by pagan Prussians, and the monks were massacred in front of the inhabitants. Soon after, new monks arrived from Ko\u0142bacz and began re",

This institution, consolidated in the 1960s, was important for the production of educational content and prevailed in parallel with the future state media company until its closure in 1995.\nIn 1973, during the self-proclaimed Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, the National Radio Broadcasting Company of Peru (Spanish: Empresa Nacional de Radiodifusi\u00f3n del Per\u00fa, ENRAD Per\u00fa) was created, an entity that brought together Channel 7 of Lima and Radio Nacional, in addition to managing certain expropriated media such as Radio La Cr\u00f3nica AM or Channel 9 in Lima. In parallel and until the end of the regime, the commercial shareholders of the Am\u00e9rica and Panamericana television networks founded the company Telecentro, a subsidiary in charge of programming production for both stations, in response to the expropriation of 51% of their shares by the State. During this time, at the end of 1976, Channel 7 in Lima began to progressively broadcast in colour, producing all of its programming in this technology in 1979.\nIn 1981, months after the second government of Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry began, ENRAD Peru was reorganized under the name Peruvian Film, Radio and Television Company (Spanish: Empresa de Cine, Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Peruana, ENCRTP) and was temporarily assigned to the National System of Social Communication (Spanish: Sistema Nacional de Comunicaci\u00f3n Social, SINACOSO). Furthermore, in that same year, Channel 7 of Lima changed its name to Radio Televisi\u00f3n Peruana (RTP) and began satellite transmissions. This last event allowed it to increase and consolidate its coverage at the national level since, until then, its repeater stations in the rest of the country retransmitted the programming of the main station in Lima via microwave. There were plans to form the Production Center for original content in 1982; However, the company had trouble establishing what content was profitable when it retired programming educational content in 1984.\nRTP was the main attempt to become public and commercially competitive broadcasting. Furthermore, in 1985, regional subsidiaries were established under the name sociedad an\u00f3nima. However, that corporation entered an ambiguous situation due to its editorial dependence on the government of the day. It was liquidated in 1996 by former president Alberto Fujimori. Also during Fujimori's government, both SINACOSO and ENCRTP were unified into a single entity renamed to its current name (IRTP) in 1997.\nDenomination change\nIn the early 2000s, Valent\u00edn Paniagua's government undertook a restructuring of the IRTP. This initiative involved the recruitment of professionals without political ties, as well as the incorporation of new presenters with different perspectives. Additionally, the IRTP launched Radio Filarmon\u00eda\u00a0, a station specialized in classical music and opera, in agreement with the Radio Filarmon\u00eda.\nIn 2004, an international television channel was planned on the Lima UHF band, called TNP 2 (currently TV Per\u00fa 7.2\u00a0), with programming differentiated from TNP. However, the project was rejected at the end of Alejandro Toledo's government. In 2007, the focus was on investing in the news sector at the local and regional level, acquiring transmitters (19 UHF and 18 VHF) to expand coverage to 13 million viewers.\nFollowing the restructuring, the IRTP came under the direct supervision of the Prime Minister. Subsequently, between July 2010 and January 2012, it was temporarily subordinated to the Ministry of Culture. Since the government of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the IRTP has remained attached to said Ministry.\nDigitalisation era\nThe IRTP increased its production of its own content after Mar\u00eda Luisa M\u00e1laga assumed the position of Board of Directors and executive president of the IRTP in 2012. The news channel TV Per\u00fa 7.3\u00a0 was launched on Novembe",
    "Football club in Spain active between 1922 and 1941\nFootball club\nThe Eiri\u00f1a Club de F\u00fatbol was a Spanish football club located in Pontevedra, Galicia, founded in 1922, and disappeared on 16 October 1941, when it merged with the Alfonso XIII CF to form the Pontevedra CF.\nHistory\nOrigins\nIn 1921, the modest L\u00e9rez FC, encouraged by the \u00c1lvarez Limeses and the son of the Marquis of Riestra, wanted to grow, so it changed location and colors to become Eiri\u00f1a FC, which became the best club in the prehistory of the Pontevedra football. Some of the members of L\u00e9rez FC were Ant\u00f3n Losada, Alexandre B\u00f3veda, and Alfonso Rodr\u00edguez Castelao. The first references to L\u00e9rez FC date back to 1909, which played its games in A Xunqueira do Cobo.\nGolden age\nThe Eiri\u00f1a Club de F\u00fatbol was founded in 1922, taking its name from the A Eiri\u00f1a neighborhood\u00a0, and which wore a striped yellow and black jersey with black pants. Together with Alfonso XIII CF and the Pontevedra Athletic Club, Eiri\u00f1a became one of the three most important clubs in the city in the early 1920s, competing in the Regional Championship of Galicia\u00a0 until 1926, when Pontevedra AC disappeared following a decline thanks largely to the arrival of professionalism.\nThe other two, Eiri\u00f1a FC from Campo de Pasar\u00f3n and Alfonso XIII FC from Campo de Burgo, managed to survive due to their youth and organization. In April 1931, the Spanish Second Republic was established and the Alfonsista club was forced to change its name, becoming known as Pontevedra Sport Club, continuing to compete until the arrival of the Spanish Civil War; while Eiri\u00f1a FC became the main club in the city, proclaiming itself Champion of Serie B in 1923 and playing in the first Category since then. The team's greatest achievement was competing in Spain's Tercera Divisi\u00f3n in consecutive seasons (1929\u201330, 1931\u201332, and 1932\u201333). The club then won the Galicia Amateur Championships in the 1932\u201333 and 1933\u201334, before being proclaimed Champion of the inaugural Copa Galicia in 1936, beating Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a 6\u20134 on aggregate in the final. With the arrival of the Civil War, all regional competitions were paralyzed and football activity gradually decreased, but not before Eiri\u00f1a participated in the First Category of the South Championship where they placed fifth. In the 1937\u201338 season, the club participated in the Galician Championship, called the Galician Army Corps Cup, where it finished fourth and last classified.\nDecline and colapse\nWhen the war ended, both Eiri\u00f1a and Pontevedra SC remained active, but the great sporting and human burden made the development of both in a different panorama almost unfeasible, so the directors decided to meet and study a way out of this situation, resulting in the merger of both into a single entity that was capable of representing the city with the proper support. Thus, on 16 October 1941, the Pontevedra Club de F\u00fatbol was established and its first president was Fernando Ponte Conde.\nNotable players\nDaniel D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n\nHonours\nReal Betis\nGalician Championship of Serie B:\nChampions (1): 1922\u201323\nRegional Championship of Galicia\u00a0:\nChampions (2): 1932\u201333 and 1933\u201334\nCopa Galicia:\nChampions (1): 1936\n",
    "Football club in Spain active between 1912 and 1939\nFootball club\nThe Iluro Sport Club was a Spanish multi-sport club located in Matar\u00f3, Maresme, founded in 1912, considered the predecessor of the current CE Matar\u00f3. It contested two finals of the second category Catalan Championship in 1923 and 1924.\nIn addition to football, the club also created its sections of field hockey in 1928, basketball in 1939, also known as Iluro BC, which won the Catalan basketball Championship in 1934. The club disappeared in 1939.\nHistory\nBeginnings of football in Matar\u00f3\nThe first references to football in Matar\u00f3 can be found in 1901, when members of the Sociedad Colomb\u00f3fila Mensajera Iluro, based in the Sport Mataron\u00e9s building, began to play inside the local velodrome wearing a red and white striped t-shirt. These two teams, Iluro and Matar\u00f3n\u00ed, played a few matches throughout the 1910s, but football did not begin to be organized in earnest until the following decade, driven by the students of Escolapis and Valldemia schools. That first entity did not come to fruition, football continued to grow and be practiced both in streets and squares as well as in the Colegio de los Hermanos Escolapios de Santa Ana, with the first serious club emerging in early 1911, FC Catalunya de Matar\u00f3, which played on an Escolapis lot in the Lepant street, and which played two matches with a team from Vilassar de Mar on 11 February and 25 March 1911, the latter at the old Vel\u00f2drom de Matar\u00f3\u00a0, located in the current Central Park. This team was only officially established in April 1911 with Salvador Garriga as its first president.\nThe Catalonia SC initiative had an immediate effect on another group of young people who played in the municipal park and, in that same month, members of Sport Mataron\u00e9s founded the Matar\u00f3 Foot-ball Club, with a board chaired by Joaquim Soler, wearing initially red and white t-shirt. As time went by, both clubs saw the need to unite to increase their social and sporting mass, being merged in December, continuing under the name Matar\u00f3 FC, registering a few days later in the Catalan Football Federation where it was considered a Second Category club. The growing trend of the infant society increased and on 1 January 1912, the Campo de Fomento (Fomento Mataron\u00ed) was inaugurated, property of the aforementioned Sport Mataron\u00e9s, which had been a national shooting and football field located in the current Ronda d'Alfons X, next to the Paseo de Cabanelles and the Convent of the Capuchinas. On its inauguration day, the field hosted the so-called Copa Matar\u00f3 organized by \"Matar\u00f3 FC\", having as guests FC Barcelona and Catal\u00e1 SC, both from Catalonia, and according to the local press, the Blaugranas demonstrated \"in every game a lot of superiority over the opposing club\", beating Matar\u00f3 7\u20130. A few months later, on 30 June, Matar\u00f3 played a friendly match against RCD Espanyol at the Campo del Fomento Mataron\u00ed, and it surprisingly won 3\u20132, with the chronicles of that match stating that it was \"one of the most beautiful played in Matar\u00f3\", and highlighted the defense made-up of Ximenes and Cuadrada, which \"played extraordinarily\". In addition to facing clubs around him in the Catalan football championship, Matar\u00f3 FC, now wearing red and black with black pants and chaired by Josep Soler Moreu, also faced Valldemia FC, another local club born around that time that, together with the Escuelas P\u00edas, served as a quarry for a large number of young people to train.\nIluro SC\nAt the end of 1912, internal disputes between members of Matar\u00f3 FC ended up causing some of them to leave to found a new club where they could start again, titled Iluro Sport Club, which played their first match on 29 December, losing 3\u20130 to FC Vilasar. This result did not discourage the club who, wearing a black shirt with black pants, strengthened the steps to elect its first Board of Directors on 2 March 1913 with Josep Serra as president, Jaume Subir\u00e1 as vice president, Pelegr\u00ed Lluri\u00e1 as secretary, Joan Escapa as an accountant, and a certain Mr. Parera took care of the treasury.\nWith the new National Shooting Range located on the Paseo de Rocafonda used by Sport Mataron\u00e9s, which was just a few hundred meters away from Campo de Fomento, Iluro SC soon gained more and more followers, until having enough to not only hold second and third teams, but also to beat Matar\u00f3 FC in their intense duels, a power struggle that continued until the summer of 1915 when Matar\u00f3 FC, poorly managed and with continuous changes of directors, ended up folding and disappearing. In 1914, Iluro SC contested its first regional competitions and in 1915, the club moved to the field of play of the now-defunct FC Matar\u00f3.\nWith hardly any opposition in the town, the club had no activity for a long time, and in 1917, the board of directors of Iluro SC demanded to use Campo de Fomento as it was better conditioned for football practice, an request that was approved and then celebrated on 8 July, inviting FC Barcel",
    "French mixed martial artist (born 1993)\nKevin Jousset (born 2 May 1993) is a French professional mixed martial artist, currently competing in the Welterweight division in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). A professional competitor since 2019, Jousset formerly competed for the Hex Fight Series in Australia, where he has been the first simultaneous double Welterweight and Middleweight Champion.\nEarly life\nKevin Jousset was born on (1993-05-02)2 May 1993 in Bordeaux, France and then quickly moved with his family to Gap where he grew up. Jousset started judo as a child and received his 2nd dan black belt at the age of 14. He pursued his judo career along with other French prospects at the Rennes Academy and Bordeaux France Academy before moving to Paris and joining INEF and INSEP.\nUnfortunately, he had to stop his career after a serious shoulder injury and chose to spend one year and a half in Scotland for learning English at the age of 21. Two years later, he moved to Melbourne, Australia in November 2016 where he got a fitness coach diploma and started mixed martial arts.\nMixed martial arts career\nEarly years\nJousset quickly joined Absolute MMA in Melbourne where he met Alexander Volkanovski and elite grappler Craig Jones. He stayed there for four years and prepared his first fights with the team. After a few amateur wins, he made his professional debut in March 2019 at Hex Fight Series 18 and went on to win the bout via knockout with a knee strike in the first round. For his third professional fight, he lost against Jack Della Maddalena on 4 October at Eternal MMA 48 for the EMMA Welterweight Championship after a doctor stoppage at the end of round 2. He then settled down in Auckland, New Zealand in January 2020 and joined City Kickboxing where he made a training camp the previous year.\nIn 2023, he became the first fighter ever to become a two-division champion in the Australian elite MMA promotion HEX Fight Series after winning the HEX Vacant Middleweight Belt in February and then the HEX Welterweight Belt in May.\nUltimate Fighting Championship\nIn August 2023, Jousset signed with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) after becoming the first HEX double champion. His City Kickboxing teammate and friend Israel Adesanya as well as his coach Eugene Bareman recommended to the UFC staff to sign him after Jousset's progress and dominance in training. On 10 September 2023, he made his promotional debut against Irish fighter Kiefer Crosbie at UFC 293 in Sydney, Australia and won by submitting him with a rear-naked choke at the end of round one. Following his fast win, he called out fellow UFC Welterweight Ian Machado Garry in an attempt to continue the theme of defeating Irish fighters.\nHe faced Song Kenan on 9 December at UFC Fight Night 233. He won the fight via unanimous decision with all three judges scoring 30\u201327 for the Frenchman. For his third bout in the UFC, he was scheduled to face Jared Gooden on 11 May 2024 at UFC on ESPN 56. However, due to medical reasons, Gooden was unable to compete and the bout was cancelled.\nChampionships and accomplishments\nMixed martial arts\nHex Fight Series\nFirst ever HEX double champion\nHEX Welterweight Championship (One time)\nHEX Middleweight Championship (One time)\nMixed martial arts record\nAmateur record\nSee also\nList of current UFC fighters\nList of male mixed martial artists\n",

    "Saturn Electrostatic Discharges (also referred to as SEDs) are atmospheric lightning events in convective weather storms on Saturn that produce high frequency (HF) radio emissions (1-40\u00a0MHz). Terrestrial lighting events on Earth, in comparison, occur in the very low frequency (VLF) radio band, between 3\u00a0Hz and 30\u00a0kHz. This makes SED signals at least 10,000 times stronger. While first discovered by NASA's Voyager 1 mission, the scientific community has gained further understanding through the following Voyager 2 and Cassini missions in conjunction with ground-based observation and data gathering methods.\nVoyager\nSaturn Electrostatic discharges were first recorded by the Voyager 1 mission as it passed near Saturn in November 1980. The term was subsequently coined by Warwick et al. in April 1981 in the Journal Planetary Radio Astronomy Observations from Voyager 1 Near Saturn. It was initially uncertain whether these SEDs were associated with storms in the planet's atmosphere or if they were originating in its rings. Evans et al. hypothesized that they originated from a satellite located within Saturn's B Ring, which was also the proposed reason for a narrow feature also found. This was disputed in 1983 by Kaiser et al., who argued that the occultation caused by the planet lasted too long for SEDs to originate in the rings.\nCassini\nWhen the Cassini mission reached Saturn in 2004, SEDs and optical storm observations were finally directly linked. This occurred when Cassini ISS imaged the Dragon Storm, which was located by the SEDs it produced and then optically verified. It and other white storm clouds were found to be brighter in conjunction with higher rates of SEDs. The Dragon Storm can range over 2,000 miles and is located at a planetocentric latitude of 35\u00b0 south. This planet region is called \"storm alley\" as all storm activity on Saturn was concentrated here in a 1.5\u00b0 band from 2002 to 2010.\nDuring the Cassini mission, it was also discovered that SEDs could be detected over the horizon. This phenomenon, known as over-the-horizon events, was made possible by the previously mentioned combination of radio and optical observations. It is theorized that this occurs when SED radio waves are temporarily trapped under Saturn's ionosphere.\nGround based observations\nThe first reliable ground-based detections of SEDs occurred in Ukraine in January/February 2006. At this time, SED storm E lasted approximately one month. The ground team used the UTR-2 radio telescope, and the data was combined with real-time information from Cassini. These efforts were made easier by the high intensity of the SEDs occurring during the month-long SED storm E. The process was repeated in November 2007 during the eight-month-long storm F and produced a high degree of coincidence between the UTR-2 and Cassini.\nAt this same time as storm E, amateur astronomers became engaged in observing Saturn's storms. Storm E, observed by Cassini, was the first long-lasting SED storm while Saturn was distant from solar conjunction, making it high in the sky for ground-based observers. In the images captured by amateurs, the SED storms proved easily detectable, manifesting as bright white spots.\n",
    "American biochemistry researcher\nShu-ou Shan is a Chinese American biologist who is a professor at the California Institute of Technology. Her research combines mechanistic enzymology with biophysical characterization techniques (e.g. cryo EM and fluorescence spectroscopy) to understand biogenesis pathways. She was awarded the 2024 National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology.\nEarly life and education\nShan was born and raised in Shanghai. She moved to the United States after high school, and studied chemistry at the University of Maryland, College Park. She was a doctoral researcher at Stanford University, where she worked alongside Daniel Herschlag on RNA catalysis. She was first introduced to mechanistic enzymology there. She moved to University of California, San Francisco as a postdoctoral researcher, where she worked with Peter Walter on cell biology.\nResearch and career\nIn 2005, Shan joined the faculty at California Institute of Technology. Her science is driven by questions about how cells control biological processes and the molecular principles that underpin biological recognition and mechanisms that define protein delivery.\nShan looks to understand the molecular mechanisms of co-translational protein machineries; including folding, assembly, targeting and biogenesis. Co-translational describes processes that occur at the same time as translation during protein synthesis.

    "Rubric identifying the start of Prosper's commentary in Vat. lat. 1086\nProsper of Reggio Emilia (died 1332/1333) was an Augustinian hermit and scholar.\nProsper was born in the 1270s. He was sent by his order to study theology at the University of Paris. He served the order as a lector at Milan before returning to Paris to complete his studies. He became a Master of Theology in March 1316. In 1318, he was appointed examiner of the Augustinian schools in Italy. By 1321, he was the regent of the Augustinian studium generale in Bologna, where he taught until his death in 1332 or 1333.\nProsper's notebook survives in the Vatican Library, where it has been bound together with his extensive but incomplete commentary on the Sentences as Vat. lat. 1086. Marginal notes were added later in the 14th century. A citation of his commentary is also found in Thomas of Strasbourg's commentary. His notebook contains reports (reportationes) of various quodlibeta, including his own.\nLike Durand of Saint-Pour\u00e7ain, Prosper attacked the then reigning theory of cognitive habits. Rather than see such habits as entities in the intellect, he views them as products of the \"imaginative\" or \"ostensive\" power of the soul to \"show\" things to the intellect.\nNotes\n^ Courtenay 2007, p.\u00a0345.\n^ Courtenay 2007, pp.\u00a0345\u2013346.\n^ Courtenay 2007, pp.\u00a0345\u2013346.

    "Former prison in Singapore\nOutram Prison, also known as Pearl's Hill Prison or Civil Jail, was a prison at Pearl's Hill, Outram, Singapore. Originally occupied by the Civil Jail, Outram Prison was opened in 1882 and served as the main prison complex before the construction of Changi Prison in 1936.\nIt was demolished in 1963 and replaced by Housing and Development Board (HDB) blocks and a shopping complex.\nHistory\nCivil Jail\nOutram Prison, then known as the Civil Jail, in the 1850s.\nIn 1847, Charles Edward Faber built the Civil Jail, also known as Her Majesty's Gaol, at the present site at Pearl's Hill, Outram. Two time capsules were buried at the base of the foundation, containing parchment with revenue figures and different types of currency.\nIn 1872, a Commission of Inquiry into the prison system suggested that current prison regimes had 'lost sight of the punitive aspect of prison life'. After the riot at Bras Basah Jail, a plan to build an extension that would be more secure was considered at either Bras Basah Jail or the Civil Jail; they later decided to build the extension at Civil Jail.\nOutram Prison\nOriginal proposed plan of Outram Prison by McNair that was never built, circa 1880s.\nWhen Outram Prison was built between 1879 and 1882 at the Civil Jail site by J. F. A. McNair, they adopted a more cellular concept that included stricter control of the prison perimeter. Outram Prison was also built using convict labour from Bras Basah Jail.\nThe public executions of the convicted sepoys at Outram Prison, circa\u2009March 1915\nAfter the 1915 Singapore Mutiny, 47 sepoys were publicly executed by firing squad at Outram Prison while others were sentenced to imprisonment for up to 20 years. The executions were witnessed by an estimated 15,000 people.\nIn the 1930s, Outram Prison suffered from overcrowding and was considered a hazard. The prison was designed to hold up to 1,080 prisoners but, in the 1920s, gained an average daily number of convicts of 1,043 and had reached up to 1,311 by 1931. This led to plans for a new prison to be built at Changi.\nAfter the construction of Changi Prison, Outram Prison was used to hold convicts serving short sentences whilst Changi Prison was used for longer sentences.\nA prisoner after his release from the Japanese occupied Outram Prison, circa 1945.\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Singapore, Outram Prison was known as Outram Road Gaol and was controlled by the Japanese and used to hold prisoners of war. 1,470 prisoners died of starvation, torture, and diseases while only 400 survived by 1945. As a result, 44 Japanese officers were convicted of war crimes committed at Outram Prison with 3 generals executed. The prison was handed back to the British following the end of the occupation.\nIn 1952, a new block for female convicts was made, replacing the block for European convicts. In 1954, a new block for remanding convicts was made. In 1956, a centre for reforming youths was opened at Outram Prison, replacing the remanding block.\nDemolition\nIn 1963, then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew announced plans to demolish Outram Prison and replace it with a Housing and Development Board (HDB) estate. Convicts from Outram Prison were transferred to Changi Prison and Bedok Reformation Centre.\nOutram Prison was replaced by Queenstown Remand Prison in 1966, which cost S$2\u00a0million to build. In 1966, works began to build 1,000 housing units and 400 shops. In 1970, public housing and a shopping complex called Outram Park Complex were built.\nSee also\nChangi Prison\n",
    "American writer (1835\u20131923)\nSusan Blanchard Elder (April 19, 1835 \u2013 November 3, 1923) was an American writer known for her contributions to literature, particularly focusing on themes of family, religion, and the American South. She was born in Fort Jessup, Sabine Parish, Louisiana, to Albert Gallatin Blanchard, a military officer, and Susan Thompson. Despite her father's military obligations, which often took him away from home, Susan spent her formative years in both the North and South.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nElder was born on April 19, 1835, in Fort Jessup, Sabine Parish, Louisiana, to Albert Gallatin Blanchard, a military officer in both the U.S. and Confederate armies, and Susan Thompson. Following her mother's death during her childhood and her father's military duties, she spent several of her formative years living with relatives in the North. She later returned to Louisiana as a teenager and received education at the Girls' High School of New Orleans and St. Michael's Convent of the Sacred Heart in St. James Parish.\nMarriage and career\nDuring her adolescence, using the pen name \"Hermine,\" Elder began publishing poems, essays, and stories in local newspapers. Notable examples from this period include the poems \"Babies\" and \"First Ride.\" In 1855, she converted to Catholicism and married Charles D. Elder, brother of William H. Elder, the Archbishop of Cincinnati. The couple relocated to Selma, Alabama, during the Civil War, where they established their home as a Confederate hospital. After the war, they returned to New Orleans, where Elder pursued a career in education, teaching math and natural science at various institutions.\nLiterary contributions\nElder's literary career flourished post-war, with her writings published in several Roman Catholic periodicals. She served on the editorial staff of the Morning Star from 1882 to 1890, contributing extensively to Catholic publications. Her works encompassed a range of genres, with a particular emphasis on historical novels. Notable publications include James the Second (1874) and The Leos of the Papacy (1879).\nLegacy and later years\nSusan Blanchard Elder's notable literary contributions include The Life of Abb\u00e9 Adrien Rouquette (1913), a biographical study of the poet-priest and missionary to the Louisiana Choctaw Native Americans. Her novel Ellen Fitzgerald (1876) and patriotic work A Mosaic of Blue and Gray (1914) reflect her interest in Southern themes.\nIn her later years, Elder resided in Cincinnati with her daughter until her death on November 3, 1923.\n",

She came to Australia as a backpacker in 1995 and settled in Sydney. She lived in Coogee for about 20 years.\nCareer\nIn Sydney, she worked as a journalist and then editor for travel and celebrity magazines. Among other titles, she worked for Woman's Day.\nWainwright was Deputy Editor for OK! Magazine before joining Mamamia's parenting site iVillage Australia as Editor in 2013. The following year, she was appointed Editor of the main Mamamia site itself. She says that the motivation for her transition from print \"gossip magazines\" to digital (at a substantial pay cut) was driven by the traditional media becoming \"meaner. Especially about women, their relationships and their bodies.\"\nIn 2016, Mamamia split into two divisions \u2014 news and entertainment \u2014 with Wainwright appointed editor of the latter. By 2018, she was Head of Content and was co-hosting Mamamia's flagship podcast Mamamia Out Loud together with Mamamia founder Mia Freedman and Executive Editor Jessie Stephens.\nWainwright has toured with her Mamamia Out Loud co-hosts as they present live shows in a similar format to the podcast to audiences around Australia. They toured in 2018 (Tamworth, Newcastle, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, Dubbo), 2019 (Hobart, Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Adelaide, Cairns, Orange, Gelong, Sydney), 2022 (Orange, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne Sydney), and 2024 (Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney). Wainwright has described the live shows as \"absolutely one of the best professional experiences I\u2019ve ever had.\"\nNovels\nFour of her novels have been published:\nThe Mummy Bloggers (Allen & Unwin, 2017)\nHow to be Perfect (Allen & Unwin, 2018)\nI Give My Marriage a Year (Pan Australia, 2020)\nThe Couple Upstairs (Pan Australia, 2022)\nMia Freedman compared the style of her first novel to that of Liane Moriarty and Zo\u00eb Foster Blake. \nAlicia Franceschini in Glam Adelaide wrote that although the book \"does sometimes fall into the trap of painting an almost caricature of women\u2019s experiences of motherhood, it never fails to do so with a light-hearted nature and a tongue in cheek self awareness that is rarely seen in modern literature for women.\"\nWriting for the New Zealand Herald, reviewer Hannah Tunnicliffe praised I Give My Marriage a Year for its \"back-story, humour, psychological insight and explanations that deepen your interest and attachment\" to the characters depicted. Rosalind Moran, reviewing the same book for ArtsHub, concluded \"through investigating the personalities and relationships of her characters with a fine-tooth comb, Wainwright prompts the reader to consider their own life and relationships; how these might be fraying at the seams; and whether they might do better.\"\nThe Couple Upstairs was listed at #24 on Better Reading's list of the \"Top 100 Books of 2023\". Dee Young in Brisbanista described it as \"a novel that delves into the darker side of human nature, relationships, and where they lead. Is there a way of preventing another person from making similar mistakes to those made by oneself in the past? AND, is intervention an option or should one leave well alone?\" The Australian Women's Weekly called it \"an important read.\"\nWainwright's writer's festival appearances include:\nBurdekin Readers and Writers Festival 2018\nNorthern Beaches Readers Festival 2022\nBrisbane Writers Festival 2023\nCairns Tropical Writers Festival 2023\nStoryFest (Shoalhaven) 2023\nPersonal life\nWainwright has a partner and two children.

Reviewer Rebecca Wu in Glam Adelaide highlighted Stephens' \"wonderful skill of interweaving seemingly ordinary occasions of life in a way that tells a story without any drudgery. In fact, she makes it enticing.\" Although Emily Paull's review in The AU Review was generally unfavourable, she acknowledged that \"the ideas behind the book are strong, and that there is a need for more books which examine the not so happy endings in life, and don't hold romantic partnerships up to be the thing that completes us as humans.\"\nThe enthusiastic reception of the book in the US led Sue Smethurst in The Australian to call Stephens \"our  next big thing\".\nSomething Bad is Going to Happen deals with themes of the mental health of its young protagonists. For this, it has been likened to \"a modern-day Bell Jar\", and Alexandra Hill in The Australian called it \"a very important new release.\"\nPersonal life\nStephens' identical twin sister, Clare Stephens, also works for Mamamia.

    "Chilean racehorse\nFor the unrefined sugar product, see Panela.\nPapelon (foaled 22 July 2006), also spelled Papel\u00f3n, is a Chilean Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico Club H\u00edpico de Santiago Falabella four times. He was named a Chilean divisional champion for five years and was considered the 'King of Staying' in Chile during his career.\nBackground\nPapelon is a chestnut stallion with an off-center star and a small strip. Papelon was bred by Haras San Patricio.\nPapelon's sire, Monthir, was bred and raced in the United States. Monthir was thought to have promise for the Kentucky Derby as a two-year-old, but he failed to win any stakes races, although he did finish second in the Grade 3 Nashua Stakes and Grade 2 Hutcheson Stakes and third in the Grade 3 Bay Shore Stakes. Monthir was exported to Chile to stand at Haras San Patricio. Papelon was part of Monthir's second crop.\nPapelon's dam Encubierta was unraced and had produced two foals before Papelon, of which one was unraced and the other won twice. Encubierta is a full sister to Escania, Chilean Champion 2-Year-Old Dirt Filly and winner of the Group 1 Tanteo de Potrancas, and Eccellenza, Chilean Champion 2-Year-Old Dirt Filly and Champion 3-Year-Old Dirt Filly and winner of the Group 1 Tanteo de Potrancas and Group 1 Mil Guineas.\nPapelon was named after an anecdote from Dr. Ignacio Coloma's father.\nPapelon was owned by Stud Kekita and trained by Carlos Urbina during his racing career. He specialized in long distance turf races and heavy track conditions.\nRacing career\n2008/09: Two-year-old season\nPapelon ran five times in 2009 as a two-year-old, all in maiden races at Hip\u00f3dromo Chile on the dirt. He lost all five races, although he did finish third twice and second once.\n2009/10: Three-year-old season\nPapelon broke his maiden on his seventh try, in his second race as a three-year-old, on July 30, 2009. He won the 1200-meter race at Hip\u00f3dromo Chile by five and a half lengths. Papelon's connections then pointed him towards stakes races, starting with the Group 2 Cl\u00e1sico Domingo Segundo Herrera Mart\u00ednez on August 15, run over 1500 meters on the dirt at Hip\u00f3dromo Chile. Papelon finished fourth, but ran credibly enough that he was next entered in the Group 1 Dos Mil Guineas, a 1600-meter dirt race at Hip\u00f3dromo Chile. In the Dos Mil Guineas, Papelon performed poorly, finishing second to last in the fourteen horse field, seventeen lengths behind the winner.\nWithin the month, Papelon raced again, in his first race at a new track, finishing second in the 1700-meter Cl\u00e1sico Criadores F. S. de Carreras S. A., an ungraded stakes race run at Valparaiso Sporting Club. He next ran at the third of Chile's major racetracks, and the track where he would eventually mark his greatest victories: Club H\u00edpico de Santiago. The race, the listed stakes Cl\u00e1sico Preparaci\u00f3n Luis Cousi\u00f1o S., was also his first time running clockwise, on the turf, and at a distance of 2000 meters. Papelon won the race by a head, and was next pointed to the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico El Ensayo, one of the most important races on the Chilean calendar and first race of the Chilean Triple Crown. In the Cl\u00e1sico El Ensayo, Papelon ran fourth behind Belle Watling, who would go on to be the Chilean Horse of the Year for that season. Papelon faced Belle Watling again in his last race of 2009, the Group 2 Gran Cl\u00e1sico Coronaci\u00f3n, finished second to her by two and a quarter lengths.\nIn January 2010, Papelon ran in the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico El Derby at Valparaiso Sporting Club and finished sixth.

    "Japanese animator & director\nYasuhiro Nakura (Japanese: \u540d\u5009 \u9756\u535a, Hepburn: Nakura Yasuhiro) is a Japanese animator, illustrator, character designer, and director.\nEarly life\nNakura was born in Hamakita, Shizuoka, Japan, on January 10, 1959. His parents ran a textile shop.\nCareer\nHe enrolled in an animation course offered by Toei Animation that he saw advertised in Manga Shounen\u00a0 and moved to Tokyo. After completing the course, he joined Studio Carpenter where he debuted as an in-between animator on Starzinger (1978), and later as a key animator on Dotakon (1981). He worked at Studio Carpenter for about three years and then went freelance, mainly for Toei Animation's works.\nHis character concepts were used for the 1984 television series Little Memole, which he also worked on as an animation director (his debut in the role). The following year, he was the animation director for Mamoru Oshii's film, Angel's Egg, with designs by Yoshitaka Amano, in which he supervised and corrected drawings to follow Amano's original image boards. In 1987, he served as character designer and animation director to another feature film, The Tale of Genji (1987) with director Gisabur\u014d Sugii. In 1990, he participated in Moomin as the animation character designer, having been a fan of the series prior.  He also served as the character designer and chief animation director for Rintaro's Metropolis (2001).\nAt some point in his career, Nakura began to take on more work as an illustrator, rather than an animator or animation director. While he continued to work on animated series and films, his output in either decreased significantly during the 1990s and 2000s. He was the character designer and chief animation director for the Tenshu Monogatari arc of Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales and was the animation director for Gothicmade in 2012, but contributed in minor key animation roles between them.\nIn the early 2010s, Nakura developed a relationship with animation studio Shaft as a key animator and animation director on the Monogatari series. His output in the industry increased during this time as he contributed to other Shaft series like Mekakucity Actors (2014) and contributed as a guest director, designer, and animator for an episode of the Bones series Space Dandy (2014). In 2016, Nakura worked as the main layout artist, layout setting designer, and art setting designer for Shaft's adaptation of March Comes In like a Lion. He also regularly contributed to some of the series' ending animation themes, which he storyboarded, directed, and animated on his own.\nStyle\nDirector and founder of studio Satelight Tsuneo Maeda, who was the animation technical director for The Tale of Genji, described Nakura as an emotional person, which he called rare among key animators, and that he was slow, which was connected to his tenacity and made his work attractive. Maeda also considered Nakura to not be pattern-based, and thus it was always difficult or mysterious as to how his drawings and work would come out. Although he said that it may be difficult for some of his drawings to be used, Maeda lamented that Nakura was able to create cuts of animation that others could never draw as well.\nWorks\nTeleivison series\n\u00a0 Highlights main staff roles.\nOVAs/ONAs\nFilms\nNotes\nBook citations\nAnimage October (1985).

    "\nNature reserve\nThe Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve is a biosphere reserve in the Indian state of West Bengal, based on the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme list. It is one of the 18 biosphere reserves in India and the third largest in terms of area. The Biosphere Reserve is constituted of the Sundarbans area spread across South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas district districts of West Bengal. The Indian Sundarbans as a Biosphere Reserve is bounded by the Muri Ganga River in the west and the Hariabhanga and Raimangal rivers in the east. Sundarbans has a very rich diversity of aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna. In fact, the highly productive ecosystems of the Sundarbans act as natural fish nurseries. It provides habitat for the Royal Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris).\nThe Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve or Indian Sundarbans covers an area of 9,630 square kilometers (3,720 sq mi) and is divided into core, buffer, and transi-tion zones. The area of reserved forest under the Biosphere Reserve is about 4263 km2, of which 55% land is under vegetation cover and the remaining 45 per cent under wetland/intertidal zone. About 40% of the reserved forest area is covered under the protected area. The protected areas under the Biosphere Reserve are Sundarbans National Park, Sajnekhali Wildlife Sanctuary, Lothian Island Wildlife Sanctuary and Haliday Island Wildlife Sanctuary. The Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve area includes the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve, which comprises a total of 2558 km2 of protected forest area.\nGeography\nThe Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 9,630 square kilometers (3,720 sq mi) in the South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas district districts of south-eastern West Bengal, as well as over 100 small and large islands. It extends from Haroa and Hasnabad blocks of North 24 Parganas district in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south. There are numerous wide rivers running through the biosphere reserve, which flow mainly from north to south; Seawater flows into the biosphere reserve through river channels. The eastern boundary of the biosphere reserve is Haribhanga and Raimangal rivers. Wetlands are observed in the northern part of the biosphere reserve, which are mainly fresh water. The western boundary is determined by the Hooghly river basin.\nGeology\nHydrology\nHistory\nGeologic history\nHuman history\nEarly inhabitants populations\nSundarbans Biosphere Reserve established\nAs part of the Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB) adopted by the UNESCO General Conference in 1970, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India has adopted the National MAB Program and declared the entire 9630 km2 area of the Indian Sundarbans as a biosphere. The Indian part of the Sundarbans was established as a Biosphere Reserve by a notification in 1989, with the objective of coordinating and integrating conservation, research and training activities to create conditions for better harmony between man and the environment. In 1989, Sundarbans National Park, the core part of the biosphere reserve, was recognized as a World Heritage Site due to its unique ecosystem. The Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve was included in the global network of Biosphere Reserves in November 2001 as the second Biosphere Reserve from India after the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.\nNatural resources\nFlora\nThe 4,263 square kilometer area of the biosphere reserve consists by dense forest and watersheds, known as reserved forest, and the forest contains mangrove trees. Other than reserved forest areas, other parts of the biosphere reserve contain mangroves as well as other plants, while reserved forest areas contain a variety of mangrove species. The main trees in the forest area are sundari and garan, but an abundance of garan trees is observed. Forms almost monotonous forest with hoglar bushes along the banks of rivers and watersheds.\nFauna\nThe Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve has 58 species of mammals, 55 species of reptiles and around 248  birds species. Bengal tiger are the largest apex predators that live in forests and have no predators of their own except humans and crocodiles. River beds and wetlands are home to gharials and crocodiles, but these species are listed as endangered species in the IUCN Red List. Most of the native mammal species of the area are in the forest, except for the locally extinct rhinoceros and wild buffalo.\n",

    "American academic and author\nLinda G. Lambert is an American academic and an author. She is a professor emeritus at California State University, East Bay.\nLambert is most known for her work connecting the domains of leadership and literature, with a primary emphasis on the concepts of constructivist leadership, leadership capacity, liberation and literature. Her authored works include The Constructivist Leader (1st and 2nd editions), which also received the National Book Award from the NCSD in 1997. Her works have been translated into Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Lithuanian, and Malay, and they have been published in academic journals, including the Journal of Educational Change and the Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy.\nEducation\nLambert earned her B.A. from Washburn University in 1966. In 1978, she completed her M.A. in Educational Administration. Later, in 1983, she obtained her Doctor of Education degree from the University of San Francisco in Organization and Leadership.\nCareer\nBetween 1966 and 1975, she served as a secondary school teacher in junior and senior high schools. From 1977 to 1980, she directed the Reform in Intermediate and Secondary Education project while concurrently acting as the curriculum coordinator in Castro Valley from 1978 to 1980. Following this, she assumed the position of principal at San Jose Middle School in Marin County, California. During a brief period from 1986 to 1987, she served as the director of professional development at the Marin County Office of Education. Subsequently, she transitioned to academia, serving as a professor in the Department of Education Leadership at California State University East Bay from 1987 to 1999. Throughout her tenure at the university, she held additional roles including department chair during two terms (1991\u201393 and 1995\u201397) and director of the Center for Educational Leadership from 1995 to 1998. She also served as the Staff Development Director sponsored by the U.S. State Department and Egyptian Ministry of Education from 1989 to 1991. Since 1992, she has served as a Consultant in leadership, alongside her position as professor emeritus at California State University East Bay, a title she has held since 1998.\nWorks\nIn 1995, Lamber was the lead author of The Constructivist Leader. The book provides educational leaders with a framework for reciprocal, purposeful learning within a community, emphasizing constructivist leadership principles, updated theory, strategies for implementing standards-based reform and authentic assessment, and addressing issues of equity, diversity, and multiculturalism. Her 1997 book Who Will Save Our Schools?: Teachers as Constructivist Leaders offered a synthesis of teaching, learning, and leading principles, proposing innovative strategies for school reform.\nWhile exploring the impact of leadership on student learning through stories of three schools of varying leadership capacities, her publication titled Building Leadership Capacity in Schools offered a new framework for building organizational and human capacities and improving educational outcomes. Moreover, in 2003, she co-authored a book titled Building Leadership Capacity for School Improvement with Alma Haris. Her books emphasized the importance of maximizing leadership capabilities at all levels within schools to sustain and enhance improvement efforts.\nLambert's 2016 publication Liberating Leadership Capacity: Pathways to Educational Wisdom explored the evolution of leadership in education. The book also advocated for educators to become the primary designers of their own and their students' learning through constructivist principles. In her review of the book, Arthur L. Costa, said \"In Liberating Leadership Capacity, a compelling driving concept is that 'leadership capacities are present in the room'. The authors describe organizational conditions that promote skillful dialogue, continual learning, building trust, and sharing a common vision among members. In such schools teachers become the leaders of learning and students become the leaders of the future\". She also co-authored the book Women's Ways of Leading. The book explored a new paradigm of leadership based on values, self-awareness, and community, arguing for the importance of qualities traditionally associated with women in shaping a more enlightened and inclusive world. Moreover, she also authored The Cairo Codex. The novel followed anthropologist Justine Jenner's journey through ancient and present-day Egypt as she uncovers an ancient codex that threatens to challenge the foundations of major world religions amidst political turmoil and personal discovery. The second novel in the trilogy, The Italian Letters, was set in Italy and the third novel, A Rapture of Ravens: Awakening in Taos was set in Taos, New Mexico.\nResearch\nLambert's research explored and drew conclusions in multiple areas: teacher leadership in professional development schools; adult learning among pol",

This creative team and real-life couple work in video-supplemented performance, video itself, and installation and have presented in arts and queer spaces across the Western Hemisphere, Europe and New Zealand. The duo are known above all for extravagant and intense stage spectacles.\nPerformance studies scholar Peter Dickinson notes their performance work, \"supplements a camp aesthetic derived from drag with sophisticated video projections, original and found sound scores, the art of lipsynch and object-oriented and site-based installation (...)\". As artists, 2boys.tv are interested in the plasticity of video, often using it in a sculptural way instead of as a large screen.\nThe name 2boys.tv was in fact a result of looking for a web domain name for the project. \"(...) we came across this .tv which both references transvestism and transversalism.\" the duo told The New York Times in a 2011 interview, \"But it's actually the domain of the small island in the South Pacific called Tuvalu.

    "Association that promotes film in Sweden\nThe Swedish Film Academy (Swedish: Svenska Filmakademin), formerly the Swedish Film Society (Svenska Filmsamfundet),  is a Swedish association that promotes film in artistic, cultural, and technical terms. It is located in Stockholm, and awards the annual Kurt Linder Scholarship to young filmmakers who have made significant contributions to the Swedish film industry.\nHistory\nLike the Swedish Film Institute, the origins of the Swedish Film Academy (Svenska Filmakademin) are in the Swedish Film Society (Svenska Filmsamfundet), which was established in October 1933 by filmmakers and writers Bengt Idestam-Almquist, Arne Bornebusch, Artur Lundkvist, Gustaf Molander, Per-Axel Branner, and others. Writer Eyvind Johnson was also a member.\nThe society created a film archive and museum, which later achieved independence as Filmhistoriska samlingarna, and was in 1964 donated to the newly-formed Swedish Film Institute.\nThe other activity of the society was organising and hosting debates and lectures, and awarding scholarships for filmmaking. In 1967, the Swedish Film Association transformed itself into the Swedish Film Academy, and continued these activities. Director G\u00f6sta Werner was the inaugural president of the new academy.\nFunctions\nThe Swedish Film Academy continues to promote film in artistic, cultural, and technical terms.\nGovernance and membership\nThe Swedish Film Academy is governed by a board comprising eight people, known as the Presidium. New members can be proposed by the Presidium, and need to be elected to the academy. As of 2024 the president is Bo-Erik Gyberg.\nAs of 2024 the academy has around 140 members, who pay an annual fee of 300 Swedish krona after being elected.\nScholarships and other awards\nKurt Linder Scholarship\nThe academy has awarded the Kurt Linder Scholarship, also known as Kurt Linder Memorial Fund Grant, almost every year since 1969, when the inaugural scholarship was awarded to cinematographer J\u00f6rgen Persson. Kurt Linder (1912\u22121955) was chairman of the student film studio from 1939 to 1945, and later worked on a volunteer basis in the library of the Swedish Film Society. He also wrote articles, and was employed from 1938 until his death as advertising manager at Columbia Film AB in Stockholm.\nEligibility is limited to people under 35 who have made significant contributions to Swedish film. As of 2024 the scholarship is worth 20,000 krona.\nSilver Plaquette\nThe Swedish Film Academy's Silver Plaquette (Svenska Filmakademins silverplakett) was awarded to filmmakers in some years between 1968 and 1994, when at least five were awarded. The award itself was a silver disc of 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0in) diameter, featuring a naked man with a laurel in one hand, and embossed with the words \"Svenska Filmakademin\".\n",

Between 2005 and 2008, Tshimpaka began singing in church choirs and soon gained public attention. In 2015, she became a member of another revivalist congregation, where she was noted for her extravagant outfits. However, due to her ostentatious appearance, she was repudiated and later joined Chapelle du Phare church in Kinshasa in 2016. There, she participated in several competitions that allowed her to sing with several Congolese singers.\nCareer\n2017\u2013present: Widespread recognition with \"Coeur Fragile\" and standalone releases\nIn November 2017, Tshimpaka made a guest appearance on Innoss'B's music video for the track \"Top Model,\" from his five-track maxi single Plus. The feature propelled her into the limelight and seized the attention of Ferr\u00e9 Gola, who subsequently featured her in his Congolese rumba-infused music video for the single \"Ma Meilleur Chemise.\" Following this, Tshimpaka signed with Ferr\u00e9 Gola's FG Production label and released her debut single, \"Coeur Fragile,\" which also spawned the singles \"Ni Nani\" and \"Biloko.\" After the success of her singles, she ventured out as an independent artist and released \"Mbote\" on 5 September 2020. \"Mbote\" quickly gained popularity and amassed one million views on YouTube in three months.\nOn 28 June 2021, Tshimpaka announced that her ndombolo-infused single \"Pepele\" was in the conclusive phases of production and slated for debut on 30 June. To promote \"Pepele,\" Tshimpaka released a teaser on the same day, which sparked controversy due to its depiction of lesbianism. As a result, she was mandated to remove contentious scenes by the DRC's Commission Nationale de Censure (National Censorship Commission) before the song's official release. Paradoxically, despite the reproof, the song received widespread recognition and accumulated over one million views on YouTube within four months.\nOn 17 July 2021, Tshimpaka made a guest appearance on Innoss'B's single \"No No\", which swiftly gained widespread acclaim and peaked at second place on BBC Radio 1Xtra. On 8 July 2022, she was again featured in Samarino's ndombolo-infused single \"Epesi Pasi\", from his album Chambre Noire, which has garnered over a million views on YouTube. On 15 October, she unveiled the urban-inspired single \"Contamin\u00e9e,\" produced by Maisha Soul Records, followed by \"Mukaji Internationale\" in March 2023. Within three weeks of its release, \"Mukaji Internationale\" peaked at number seven in the top 10 most-viewed YouTube videos in Congo for March.\nTshimpaka also featured on Mputu Meya's remix of the track \"Loketo\" alongside Innoss'B on 28 September 2023, which has been viewed over 10 million times on YouTube. On 15 November 2023, she contributed to the collaborative single \"Rumba Forever,\" which brought together several Congolese artists from all generations to honor Congolese rumba. She later joined Innoss'B on stage during his \"Umoja\" humanitarian concert at the La Madeleine concert hall in Brussels, where she performed alongside Yemi Alade and Awilo Longomba. On 15 March 2024, she debuted the single \"Choquer,\" which quickly peaked at number two among the Congo's most-watched YouTube videos, with 446,000 views in April. She was subsequently invited to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Musa's Plan\u00e8te Rap on Skyrock, where she performed the \"Loketo\" remix.\nDiscography\nSingles\nAwards and nominations\n",

    "1905 Polish social organization in Minsk\nThe Polish Society \"O\u015bwiata\" (also known as the Society \"O\u015bwiata\" and \"O\u015bwiata\") was a Polish social organization founded in 1905, operating in Minsk and in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire. Until 1907, its activities were carried out clandestinely, legally from 1907 to 1909, and then again clandestinely. The society aimed to educate the inhabitants of the Minsk region, especially children, in the spirit of Polishness, as well as to disseminate Polish culture, language, and strengthen national consciousness in these lands. The organization was persecuted, and during its legal activity, it was treated with hostility by the Russian authorities because strengthening Polish identity in the annexed lands contradicted the state administration's strategy of Russification and assimilation.\nPoles in Minsk and Minsk Governorate\nAt the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Polish-speaking population and/or those declaring Polish nationality constituted a significant minority in Minsk and the Minsk Governorate. According to the census organized in 1897 in the Russian Empire, in the city of Minsk, people considering Polish as their native language accounted for 11.4% of the population, being the third largest linguistic group after those speaking Yiddish (51.2%) and Russian (25.5%). In the entire Minsk Governorate, according to the same census, people considering Polish as their native language constituted 3% of the population, trailing behind Belarusian (76%), Yiddish (16%), and Russian (3.9%). In absolute numbers, according to the census, there were 10,369 Polish-speaking individuals in Minsk and 64,617 in the Minsk Governorate. According to the census conducted in December 1919 in the territories administered by the Civil Administration of the Eastern Lands (the temporary Polish administration during the Polish\u2013Soviet War), Poles constituted 18.3% of the population in Minsk, being the third ethnic group after Jews (44.9%) and Belarusians (22.9%). In the entire Minsk District, according to the same census, Poles constituted 14.6% of the population, second only to Belarusians (64.5%). In absolute numbers, there were 18,713 Poles in Minsk and 159,706 in the Minsk District.\nCircumstances of creation\nFather Kazimierz Miko\u0142aj Michalkiewicz \u2013 president of \"O\u015bwiata\" from 1907 to 1908\nOn 12 December 1904, with the advent of the so-called \"liberal times\" in the Russian Empire, a tsarist decree was issued partially lifting restrictions on the teaching of the Polish language. It allowed for its instruction in Russian elementary and secondary schools as an optional subject, conducted outside of mandatory class hours, for an additional high fee. This fee was higher the fewer parents expressed a desire to send their children to such classes. Such conditions did not meet the educational needs of the Polish community residing in the Minsk Governorate. They expected not only the teaching of the native language to their children but also education in a Polish patriotic spirit. Therefore, efforts were made to establish educational institutions with a purely Polish character.\nIn mid-1905, the illegal Polish Society \"O\u015bwiata\" was established in Minsk. Its founders were Father Kazimierz Miko\u0142aj Michalkiewicz, Jan Offenberg, Michalina \u0141\u0119ska, and Mieczys\u0142aw Porowski. The society's activity mainly involved coordinating and expanding Polish clandestine education, which, according to reports from the tsarist police, was widespread in the Minsk Governorate. On 4 March 1906, a decree facilitating the establishment of social organizations was issued. In connection with this, Polish educational activists in Minsk decided to engage in public activities, which in their opinion could bring much better results. The Polish Society \"O\u015bwiata\" was officially registered by the Russian authorities on 11 January 1907. On March 12, a founding meeting took place, during which, according to witnesses, there was a general excitement and eagerness to work. The organization's statute was adopted, and the first board was elected. It included: president \u2013 Father Kazimierz Miko\u0142aj Michalkiewicz, vice president \u2013 doctor Jan Offenberg, secretary \u2013 doctor Czes\u0142aw Grabowiecki, treasurer \u2013 lawyer Zygmunt W\u0119c\u0142awowicz. After Father Michalkiewicz left Minsk in 1908, the position of president remained vacant, and his duties were performed by the then vice president Mieczys\u0142aw Porowski. The Society's Council also included priests: Kazimierz Bukraba, Adam Lisowski, and I. Krukowski.\nProgram\nAccording to the statute, the organization's program aimed at the intellectual and moral upliftment of all layers of the Polish society in the Minsk Governorate. Its implementation was to take place through comprehensive cultural and educational activities, including the establishment of Polish schools, running a library, organizing lectures, and summer camps for children.

    "American writer of romance and mystery novels\nAnne Austin (September 13, 1895 \u2013\u00a0?) was an American journalist and writer of romance and mystery novels.\nBiography\nAnne Austin was born in Waco, Texas. She married Charles Benson in 1912, whom she divorced soon after the birth of their child, Ellen Elizabeth. In 1922, she married Stewart Edmund Book (whom she also divorced). From 1912 to 1914 she attended Baylor University. Her first occupation was as a high school teacher in Marfa and Moody, Texas. She then worked as a feature and fiction writer and a dramatic critic for the Waco Morning News, the Kansas City Post, and other periodicals. From 1926 to 1930, she wrote for Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA Service), where she produced several serialized romance novels that were later published as books. In 1934, one of them was turned into the movie A Wicked Woman.\nIn 1929, Austin's first mystery novel The Black Pigeon was serialized in newspapers and subsequently published as a book. The story, written in the heyday of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, was a success and translated into several languages (e.g., German and French), which led to five more mystery novels featuring the investigator James \"Bonnie\" Dundee.\nStarting in 1933, Austin was under contract as a writer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios; in 1939, she was living in Hollywood, California. After the 1930s, she published no more books and seems to have disappeared entirely from the public; nothing is known about her further life.\nMother of child prodigy\nAustin's only child, Ellen Elizabeth Benson (born 1913 in Waco, Texas), was measured with an I.Q. of 214 at the age of 8, then the highest ever recorded, and became a celebrity.

    "Norwegian dog\nDocile (c.\u20091989 \u2013 1994) was a female Briard dog. Owned by football manager Egil Olsen, the dog became a national celebrity animal during Olsen's tenure as manager of the Norway national football team.\nThe dog quickly became known for accompanying Olsen to work, both in the Football Association offices and in training sessions. In addition, the Briard breed was rare in Norway, with approximately 300 individuals. According to a biographer of Egil Olsen, Docile was used as a figurehead to shield his family members from media attention. Another reason that Olsen kept a dog was to walk the dog to ailment his ankylosing spondylitis.\nThe media attention around the Norwegian men's national football team increased significantly during the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification run, which was the first successful qualification for Norway since the late 1930s. As training sessions were crowded with journalists, in early 1994 VG's Bj\u00f8rn Delebekk won the Norwegian Press Photographers' annual prize for sports photography. His photoseries of Docile frolicking around the national team players was titled \"En hund etter ball\".\nDuring the 1994 World Cup, Docile did not follow Olsen to the US and was stationed at Olsen's in-laws in Egersund. They claimed that the dog was recognised around town. The same period saw several spin-off products inspired by the dog. A woolwear factory started marketing a \"World Cup yarn\" under the name Docile. The pub Docile in Hamar acquired Olsen's acceptance to use Docile's name and likeness, both on the pub itself as well as on caps and clothing. The newspaper Dagbladet arranged a letter column in Docile's name during the 1994 World Cup. People would contact Docile's supposed fax machine number and have the chance to win a book by Tor R\u00f8ste Fossen. The same newspaper arranged a naming contest for Olsen's next dog, which would be of the same breed.\nIn early November 1994, Docile escaped from the front yard of Olsen's home. As some boys played in the street outside, the dog bit the pant leg of one of the boys, causing minor clothing damage. Reportedly against the wishes of the boy's parents, the decision was made to euthanize the dog. Docile was regarded as a national celebrity and \"Norway's most publicized dog\". Norway's largest newspaper VG stated that Olsen's unusual choice of footwear, wellington boots, coupled with Docile resting at his feet was \"A sort of trademark for the most Norwegian of all Norwegian things\".\nSee also\nList of individual dogs\n",

    "\nThe Treaty on the Russian-Ukrainian border is a bilateral international treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, which delineated the land border line between the two countries.\nTerms of the Treaty\nThe Treaty defines the \"Russia-Ukraine state border\" as the line and vertical surface passing along this line, separating the state territories (land, waters, subsoil, and airspace) of the Contracting Parties from the point of junction of the state borders of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Republic of Belarus to the point located on the shore of the Taganrog Gulf.\nThe border follows the path as specified in the Description of the Passage of the State Border between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The description and maps of the state border attached to the Treaty are its integral part.\nIt is considered that the junction point of the borders of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus is the \"Friendship Mound,\" or \"Three Sisters Mound\" \u2014 the Border Junction in the village of Senkivka of the Chernihiv District of the Chernihiv Oblast, entirely within the territory of Ukraine. According to the official classification of the UN, this triple junction point is designated as \"080 byruua\" (in alphabetical order: by \u2014 Belarus, ru \u2014 Russia, ua \u2014 Ukraine). However, it is not enshrined at the level of a trilateral international treaty.\nSigning and Ratification\nOn January 28, 2003, during the visit of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin to Kyiv, the Treaty  on the state border between the two countries was signed, which fixed its land part.\nUkraine ratified the Treaty on April 20, 2004, and the Russian Federation on April 22.\nDuring the period between the signing and ratification of the Treaty, the Tuzla Island conflict occurred, sparked by Russia's construction of a dam in the Kerch Strait from the Taman Peninsula to Tuzla Island. Analysts believed the conflict aimed to pressure Ukraine regarding the delimitation of the border in the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov.\nThe Treaty entered into force on the date of the exchange of instruments of ratification, namely on April 23, 2004.\nImplementation and Violation of the Treaty\nThe simultaneous ratification of the Treaty  on the Russia-Ukraine state border and the Treaty Between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on Cooperation in the Use of the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait on December 24, 2003, completed the legal formalization of the border line on land. On July 29, 2010, the Treaty on the demarcation of the Ukrainian-Russian state border entered into force, creating the legal basis for initiating the process of marking the Russia-Ukraine state border on the ground.\nThe problem of demarcating the land part of the Russia-Ukraine border remained a \"frozen\" issue in bilateral relations for many years. For many years, the Russian Federation obstructed this process.\nAs no measures to demarcate the border were taken due to the resistance of the Russian Federation, the Ukrainian side decided to unilaterally carry out activities to mark the border on the ground. Direct demarcation of the border is carried out based on the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of May 14, 2015, \"On marking the Ukrainian-Russian state border on the ground\".\nBeginning its armed aggression against Ukraine in 2014, Russia violated fundamental norms and principles of international law, as well as a number of bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements, including the Treaty on the Ukraine-Russia state border.\nSee also\nState Border of Ukraine\nState Border of Russia\nRussia-Ukraine relations\nProject Wall\n",

    "1970s series of safety research vehicles\nFiat ESVs (Experimental Safety Vehicle) are a small series of prototypes built by Fiat in the early 1970s, intended for research on passive safety features.\nHistory\nIn Spring 1971, Fiat starts a project to research passive safety of small (up to 1,200\u00a0lb, 540\u00a0kg) and middle class cars (up to 1,800\u00a0lb, 820\u00a0kg). In that year, the Fiat 500 has a 23.3% market share in Italy, and thus is an important factor in the safety on the Italian roads. In the same year, the American organization NHSB - National Highway Safety Bureau (later known as National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA) launches a competition reserved for American manufacturers, for the construction of an entirely new vehicle, intended to guarantee maximum passive safety.\nAt the end of 1971, only two American manufacturers, which do not even produce automobiles, have applied to the NHSB competition. Given the lack of interest, it is decided to extend the offer to all global manufacturers. In 1972, the American manufacturers Ford and General Motors as well as Fiat, Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, Nissan and Honda join this initiative.\nThese ESV cars are designed on the basis of the specifications established during the various conferences held around the world: January 1971 in Paris, France; September 1971 in Sindelfingen, Germany; July 1972 in Washington DC; March 1973 in Kyoto, Japan and June 1974, in London, England.\nFiat is the only manufacturer in the NHSB project to present one model each in three different weight categories. They stand out with very visible black protection of the front and rear of the cars, and have the ESV logo and a number indicating the weight of the vehicle in pounds, as prescribed in the American specifications.\nThe main safety test requirements of this project are protection of the passengers in:\na frontal or rear collision against a barrier at 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph)\na collision against a pole, frontal or at the rear, at 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph)\na lateral collision against a pole at a speed of 24\u00a0km/h (15\u00a0mph)\ncase of a rollover\nAs main differences with the standard cars they are based on, the three Fiat ESVs have in common: a reinforced inner skeleton, big polyurethane bumpers (in two versions: one developed by Pirelli with air chambers, the other filled with foam) at both ends with matching side protection strips, and a padded interior. The weight increase varies between 43% for the largest model and 50% for the smallest model. Also the production cost goes up, between 37% and 43%. Due to the higher weight, the cars all need a larger engine than standard, and the fuel consumption increases. Also the suspension is enforced and the wheels and tires are a size bigger than standard.\nIn all, Fiat produces 47 ESV vehicles between 1972 and 1974, at a total cost of 4.5 billion Lire (40-50 million euros). None of the experimental models designed by Fiat (or the other companies participating in this automotive safety experiment) makes it to mass production, but many elements can be seen on production models in the years to follow. Examples of the Fiat ESVs are the shock absorbing bumpers, fuel tank behind the rear seat and reinforced passenger cell with side impact protection bars in the doors of the Fiat 131, introduced in 1974 for Europe and in 1975 for the USA.\nMost of the Fiat ESVs are scrapped, but three are kept and are on display at the Heritage HUB in Turin, Italy.\nFiat ESV 1500\nFiat ESV 1500\nThe ESV 1500 project commences before the NHSB invitation to join the program. It is derived from the Fiat 500, with rear engine and rear-wheel drive, and is presented at the 1972 convention in Washington DC. Originally, it weighs no more than the targeted 680\u00a0kg (1,500\u00a0lb), with styling done by the engineers, who borrow certain elements from the yet-to-be-released Fiat 126. After the presentation, Fiat updates the experimental model for the 1973 presentation in Kyoto as the first versions would not pass the frontal pole collision test.\nThe extra reinforcements mean that the eventual prototype weighs 780\u00a0kg (1,720\u00a0lb). This means it is above the target of 1,500\u00a0lb (680\u00a0kg). Because of its weight, it is fitted with an enlarged engine: 600 cc instead of 500 cc. One of the safety features that Fiat also tests in the ESV 1500, is the use of airbags, among other restraint systems. The conclusion is that at that time, there is no satisfactory restraint system for speeds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) for a car of this size, including airbags. In total, thirteen ESV 1500 prototypes are built.\nFiat ESV 2000\nFiat ESV 2000\nThe ESV 2000 is first presented in 1973, in Kyoto. It has five doors and front wheel drive; it is derived from the 128. The engine displacement is 1300 cc instead of 1100 cc, because the car weighs 360\u00a0kg (794\u00a0lb) more than the standard model. For the styling of this car, Fiat Centro Stile is asked to make the proposals. While the original Fiat 128 is not marketed with five doors Fiat decides to add a t",
    "English soldier\nThomas Matthias Weguelin (died 23 May 1828) was an English soldier.\nBiography\nWeguelin born at Moorfields in London. He was the eldest son of John Christopher Weguelin by his second wife, Elizabeth. He was appointed a cadet in the East India Company's service in March 1781 on the Bengal presidency. He arrived in Calcutta in April 1782, having previously been promoted to an ensigncy on 16 June 1781. He joined the third European regiment at Burh\u00e1npur, and received a lieutenant's commission on 22 September 1782. In November he was removed to the first battalion of the 22nd native infantry, at the frontier station of Fatehgarh in the dominions of the naw\u00e1b of Oudh. In March 1783 he proceeded to the Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d district, where he took part in some petty operations, and in 1796, when his regiment was incorporated with the 2nd native infantry, he received the brevet rank of captain. He served against Tip\u00fa Saib from 1790 to 1792 with Lieutenant-colonel John Cockrell's detachment. He took part in the battle of Seringapatam on 13 May 1791, in the assault on the enemy's entrenched camp on 6 February 1792, and in the siege of the city. In December 1797 he was transferred to the first battalion of the 13th native infantry, which he commanded in 1799 during the deposition of the naw\u00e1b of Oudh, and shortly after joined the 1st European regiment at Cawnpur, removing with it to Din\u00e1pur at the close of the year. On 10 August 1801 he received the regimental rank of captain, and in September 1803 he proceeded in command of the flank companies of his regiment to join the army under Lord Lake, then engaged with the Marattas in the north-west, where he took part in the siege of Gwalior. In September 1804 he accompanied Lake's army in the capacity of judge-advocate-general in the field provinces north and west of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and took part in the siege of Bhartpur. He continued to hold the post until his appointment to a majority on 3 March 1808. In June he was nominated to command an expedition for the defence of the Portuguese of Macao against any French attempt, receiving the local rank of colonel. On his return to Bengal in February 1809 he received the thanks of the governor-general for his conduct. On the establishment of the commissariat in Bengal on 1 February 1810 Weguelin was appointed deputy commissary-general. He accompanied Major-general Sir John Abercromby in the expedition against Mauritius in 1810 as head of the commissariat department, and after the reduction of the island was appointed by the governor, Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar, commissary-general of Mauritius, Bourbon, and their dependencies. He returned to Bengal in March 1812 with a letter from Farquhar to the governor in council expressing his approbation of his services. On 1 July 1812 he was nominated commissary-general of Bengal with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, attaining the regimental rank on 16 March 1814. He discharged the duties of commissary-general through the two wars with Nep\u00e1l between 1814 and 1816, and that with the Pind\u00e1ris from 1816 to 1818, conducting the business of his office with so much ability that the extra expenses of the wars did not exceed the comparatively small sum of 600,000l. Being obliged by private affairs to return to England, he resigned his office at the close of 1820, embarking in January 1822. He received the rank of colonel commandant on 20 July 1823, and died in London at Montagu Square on 23 May 1828. He was twice married. By his first wife he had a son and a daughter, and by his second wife three sons.\n",
    "1975 Council of Europe treaty\nThe European Convention on the Legal Status of Children born out of Wedlock is a treaty (E.T.S. No. 85) adopted in 1975 under the auspices of the Council of Europe to harmonise the legal status of children born out of wedlock, and promote their equality with children born in wedlock, in the relevant legislation of the Contracting Parties. Accession is open to CoE Member States. As of 2024, it has been signed by 26 countries, and ratified by 23 countries. The Convention imposes an obligation on the Member States to eliminate discriminatory treatment of children born out of wedlock. The Council purposefully uses the term children born out of wedlock instead of illegitimate children.:\u200a55\u200a Historically, it is the first adopted multilateral treaty of this type.\nBackground\nThe status of children born outside of wedlock is, indirectly, or directly, also treated in provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (Articles 8, 12 and 14), the European Social Charter (Articles 16, 17), the and the European Convention on Nationality (Articles 5, 6).\nThe convention is one of the early, significant instruments in family law, especially on matters involving children, of the Council of Europe. The convention is a part of a set of other Council Treaties on matters involving children: the European Convention on the Adoption of Children, the European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children, the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights, the Convention on Contact concerning Children, the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, have also adopted a slew of recommendations. Three committees deal with the legal protection of children, in part or in full: Committee of Experts on Family Law (CJ-FA) \u2013 the most relevant \u2013 Convention Committee on the Custody Convention (T-CC), and the Committee of Experts on Nationality (CJ-NA) Other bodies of the Council concerned with this area of the law are the Conference of European Ministers of Justice, and the European Conference on Family Law. Additionally, some of the council's Colloquies on European law have been devoted to family law.:\u200a54\u201356\u200a\nHistory\nEuropean jurisdictions had recognised the concept of legitimate and illegitimate children, who had different legal status, and rights. This started to change through the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and the legislative work of the council. This occurred concurrently with national reforms intended to reduce or eliminate inequalities between children born out of wedlock and children born in wedlock, and to abolish the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children.\nGermany adopted the Law on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock/Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) in 1969, or Non-marriage Law, for short. The Law on Family Matters of 16 December 1997 further enhanced the legal protections, but a disadvantage remained with regard to illegitimate children born before 1949. Even if recognized, those children could not be their statutory heirs. This led to the case Brauer v. Germany in 2009, which overturned this inequality.:\u200a87\u200a\nLess expansive measures were also introduced by the Law of January 3, 1972 on Filiation in France, which allows mothers to recognise children born out of wedlock, although it required a legal formality. Only in the 21st century was the principle of equality fully upheld (through Act no. 2002-305 of 4 March 2002, removing mention of illegitimacy \u2013 filiation l\u00e9gitime and filiation naturell; and through Law no. 2009-61 of 16 January 2009). In 2001, France was forced in Mazurek v. France by the ECHR to change several laws that were deemed discriminatory, and in 2013 the Court ruled in Fabris v. France that these changes must also be applied to children born before 2001.\nIn the United Kingdom, discriminating treatment regarding illegitimate children by the common law progressed for a long time. Under English law, the child was considered filius nullius, that is, noone's child, and a bastard. As a result, the United States, Canada and Australia followed suit. In time, the traditional rule concerning these children was discarded, but an unmarried father could only acquire parental rights through specific means enumerated by Children Act 1989. These means were, basically, marriage or a court order.6 Eventually, with the Children Act 2004, parental responsibility was given to all those unmarried fathers who registered the birth of their children on the basis of a formal agreement with the mother.:\u200a85\u201387\u200a\nOriginally, because of the stigma related to birth outside of wedlock, the EConvHR was not interpreted in such a way to protect the rights of children born outside of wedl",

    "British major-general and royal engineer\nSir John Fretcheville Dykes Donnelly CB KCB (2 July 1834 \u2013 5 April 1902) was a British major-general and royal engineer.\nBiography\nDonnelly was born in the Bay of Bombay on 2 July 1834. He was the only child of Lieutenant-colonel Thomas Donnelly (1802\u20131881), at one time deputy adjutant-general of the Bombay army, and from 1851 staff captain and afterwards staff officer at the East India Company's military college at Addiscombe until the closing of the college in 1861 (see Vibart's Addiscombe, with portrait). His mother was Jane Christiana, second daughter of Joseph Ballantine Dykes of Dovenby Hall, Cumberland. Educated at Highgate School (1843\u20138), he entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich at the head of the list after a year's private tuition in August 1849, passed out first, and received a commission as second-lieutenant in the royal engineers on 23 June 1853, and after professional instruction at Chatham was promoted first-lieutenant on 17 February. Going out to the Crimea in June, Donnelly joined his corps on its march to Balaklava on 23 September, and next month was detailed for duty with the left attack on Sevastopol. He was present at the battle of Inkerman on 5 November, and subsequently worked in the trenches before Sevastopol with an energy to which Sir John Burgoyne called Lord Raglan's attention (21 November). Through the severe weather of the winter of 1854-5 he was on duty in the trenches forty-one times by day and forty-three times by night. On the day after the abortive assault on the Redan (18 June), when he was with the second column, he by his promptitude and zeal obtained a substantial lodgment in the Russian rifle pits at the Little Mamelon. Donnelly was mentioned in Lord Raglan's despatches for this service. Soon after the fall of Sevastopol in September during which he was thrice in all mentioned in despatches (London Gazette, 18 December), he was appointed aide-de-camp to Colonel E. T. Lloyd on 12 November 1855, the commanding royal engineer in the Crimea, and accompanied him home in June 1856. He received the Crimea medal with clasps for Inkerman and Sevastopol, the Turkish medal, and the 5th class of the legion of honour. He had been recommended for the Victoria Cross without result, and received no promotion nor British distinction.\nJoining the London military district in 1856, he was placed in command of a detachment of royal sappers and miners employed in preparing for building purposes the ground purchased at South Kensington out of the surplus funds of the Great Exhibition of 1851. It was intended to erect there a permanent museum and centre of science and art. Sir Henry Cole, the director of the scheme, secured Donnelly's services on 1 April 1858 in reorganising at South Kensington the science and art department, which was controlled by the privy council's committee of education. On 1 October 1859 he was appointed inspector for science in connection with the department. He had been promoted second captain on 1 April 1859, and was now seconded in his corps for ten years. But he did not return to regimental duty, and the rest of his career was identified with South Kensington. In 1869 he was allowed two and a half years' special leave, and in 1872 was placed on the reserve list. His promotion continued, as he was still liable for emergency service, and he became lieutenant-colonel on 1 October 1877 and brevet-colonel on 1 October 1881, retiring with the honorary rank of major-general on 31 December 1887.\nThe success of the scheme for national instruction in science and art was largely due to Donnelly, although some of his methods came to be reckoned reactionary. In agreement with a much controverted principle he arranged (by minute of 1859) that grants should be made to certificated teachers on the results of the examinations of their pupils. Prizes were at the same time to be awarded to successful students, whether trained in recognised schools or otherwise. He obtained due recognition for drawing and manual training as class subjects, and having induced the Society of Arts, which he joined in 1860, to form a class in wood-carving, he procured from City companies and other sources funds to carry it on as the School of Art Wood-carving, which is now located in Thurloe Place, South Kensington.\nIn 1874 his title at South Kensington became 'Director of Science,' and his duties included the supervision not only of the science schools and classes throughout the country but of other important scientific institutions like the Government School of Mines, the Museum of Practical Geology, the Royal College of Chemistry, the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art, and the Museum of Irish Industry, which developed into the Royal College of Science for Ireland. In 1868, as a member of a commission appointed to consider the question, he had drafted a report adverse to the establishment of a separate department of science and art for Ireland. In 18",
    "Cretaceous-era sediment source in England\nThe Cornubian Massif was an upland area and source of sediment in southwest England during parts of the Late Permian to Early Cretaceous period and through most of the Cenozoic. In extent it covered approximately the current area of Devon and Cornwall.\nHistory\nThe Cornubian Massif is underpinned by the extensive granitic Cornubian batholith that was intruded into Variscan thrust sheets of low-grade metamorphic rocks over a period of about 25 million years, between 300 and 275 Ma (million years ago), during the Early Permian. Related volcanism produced both acid and basic lavas, although only the latter are partly preserved within the lowermost parts of the Exeter Group, with the acid lavas only found as clasts in younger rocks, apart from one small exposure near Kingsand.\nThe unroofing of the batholith had already started in the Late Permian, as shown by the presence of granitic clasts in  the St. Cyres beds. During the later Permian to Triassic the massif was bordered by a set of rift basins. To the north lay the Bristol Channel Basin, extending westwards into the South Celtic Sea Basin, to the east the precursor to the Wessex Basin and to the south the Plymouth Bay Basin. It is unclear to what extent the higher parts of the massif were covered by Permo-Triassic deposits. Latest Triassic to Lower Jurassic times saw a regional marine transgression, that may have covered much of the massif, although an emergent \"spine\" of land was probably still present.\nDuring the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, rifting restarted in the basins surrounding the massif. Particularly the development of thick growth sequences in the Wealden Group show that the rifting reached a maximum at this time. The massif was actively uplifting during this period providing a source for coarse clastic sediments as seen in the Wessex Basin.\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, rifting stopped and sea levels rose, clastic sediments were cut off as the fine-grained Chalk Group was deposited. To the east of the massif there is evidence of progressive westward onlap of the Upper Cretaceous sequence onto the older rocks and it is thought likely that the whole of the massif was eventually submerged.\nDuring the latest Cretaceous, southern Britain was affected by the early stages of the Alpine orogeny. This is marked by some indications of basin inversion and regional uplift, as shown by a lack of Maastrichtian (uppermost Cretaceous) and Danian (lowermost Paleocene) strata onshore. The opening of the North Atlantic Ocean at the start of the Eocene was accompanied by the development of the North Atlantic Igneous Province. In western Britain this caused uplift, possibly due to underplating, as shown by Apatite fission track analysis with up to 300 m of uplift in western Cornwall, reducing to 50 m in south Devon. The main phase of Alpine deformation occurred during the Oligocene to Miocene, when structures such as the Portland-Wight Monocline and the Wealden Dome were formed.\nAs shown by the current form of the southwestern peninsula, the area of the massif remains mostly a relatively uplifted region, shedding sediment into the surrounding basinal areas. The current topography is thought to represent an amalgamation of erosion surfaces of varying origin acquired during its Cenozoic history.\n",
    "\nSnooker tournament, held June and July 2024\nSnooker tournament\nThe 2024 Championship League is an upcoming professional ranking snooker tournament that will take place from 10 June to 3 July 2024 at the Leicester Arena in Leicester, England. The event will feature 128 players and will be played as three rounds of round\u2011robin groups of four, before a best\u2011of\u2011five final. It will be the fifth edition of the ranking version of the Championship League, and the first ranking tournament of the 2024\u200d\u2013\u200d25 season.\nShaun Murphy is the defending champion, having defeated Mark Williams 3\u200d\u2013\u200d0 in the final of the previous ranking edition of the tournament.\nTournament format\nThe 2024 Championship League will take place from 10 June to 3 July 2023 at the Leicester Arena in Leicester, England. 128 players will take part in the event. The competition begins with 32 rounds of group matches with each group consisting of four players. Two groups are to be played to a finish every day during four blocks using a two\u2011table setup in the arena. The groups are to be contested using a round\u2011robin format, with six matches played in each group. All matches in group play are played as best of four frames, with three points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. Group positions are determined by points scored, frame difference and then head\u2011to\u2011head results between players who are tied. Places that are still tied are then determined by the highest break made in the group. If the highest break is also tied, the next highest break made by the players will be used.\nThe 32 players that top the group tables qualify for the group winners' stage, consisting of eight groups of four players. The eight winners from the group winners' stage qualify for the two final groups, with the final taking place later on the same day. The winner takes the Championship League title and a place in the Champion of Champions.\nPrize fund\nThe breakdown of prize money for the tournament is shown below.\nTournament total: \u00a3328,000\nNote: The champion receives a total of \u00a333,000 (\u00a33,000 + \u00a34,000 + \u00a36,000 + \u00a320,000).\nStage one\nStage one consists of 32 groups, each containing four players.\nOrder of play\nOrder of play to be confirmed.\nGroup 1\nGroup 1 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 1 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 1 table\nGroup 2\nGroup 2 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 2 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 2 table\nGroup 3\nGroup 3 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 3 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 3 table\nGroup 4\nGroup 4 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 4 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 4 table\nGroup 5\nGroup 5 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 5 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 5 table\nGroup 6\nGroup 6 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 6 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 6 table\nGroup 7\nGroup 7 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 7 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 7 table\nGroup 8\nGroup 8 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 8 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 8 table\nGroup 9\nGroup 9 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 9 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 9 table\nGroup 10\nGroup 10 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 10 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 10 table\nGroup 11\nGroup 11 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 11 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 11 table\nGroup 12\nGroup 12 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 12 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 12 table\nGroup 13\nGroup 13 will be played between 10 June and 28 June.\nGroup 13 matches\nPlayer 1 v Player 2\nPlayer 3 v Player 4\nPlayer 1 v Player 4\nPlayer 3 v Player 2\nPlayer 4 v Player 2\nPlayer 1 v Player 3\nGroup 13 table\nGroup 14\nGroup 14 will be played between 10",

It is better known by the abbreviation Tsukukoma (\u7b51\u99d2). Tsukukoma is affiliated with the University of Tsukuba and provides six-year secondary education programmes. Tsukukoma is the only national boys' school in Japan and is regarded as one of the most selective secondary educational institutions in the country.\nOverview\nIn 1947, Tsukukoma was established as a new junior high school affiliated with the former Tokyo Agricultural School. It was later renamed Komaba Junior and Senior High School, affiliated with Tokyo University of Education in 1952, and then, in 1978, it came under the purview of the University of Tsukuba, which replaced Tokyo University of Education that year. Although it is an affiliated school of the University of Tsukuba, very few students choose to study at the university after graduation.\nKnown for its liberal school spirit, the school has no uniforms for both junior and senior high students. It is located on the site of the former Komaba Agricultural School and maintains a tradition of rice cultivation training in paddy fields, known at the school as 'Kernel Paddy'. In its vicinity there are Komaba Toho Junior and Senior High School, Tokyo Metropolitan Komaba High School, Komaba Gakuen High School, and Nihon University Komaba Junior and Senior High School.\nTsukukoma is one of the largest sources of successful applicants to the University of Tokyo, which is generally regarded as the nation's most selective and prestigious university.

    "British lcieutenant-general and royal engineer\nNot to be confused with Robert Grant (VC).\nSir Robert Grant CB KCB GCB (10 August 1837 \u2013 8 January 1904) was a British lieutenant-general and royal engineer.\nBiography\nGrant was born at Malabar Hill, Bombay, on 10 August 1837, was younger son of Sir Robert Grant, governor of Bombay, and was nephew of Lord Glenelg. His mother was Margaret (d. 1885), only daughter of Sir David Davidson of Cantray, Nairnshire, N.B., who married as her second husband Lord Josceline William Percy, M.P., second son of George fifth duke of Northumberland.\nRobert was educated at Harrow with his elder brother Charles . When he was seventeen he passed first in a public competitive examination for vacancies in the royal artillery and the royal engineers caused by the Crimean war, and was gazetted second lieutenant in the royal engineers on 23 October 1854, becoming first lieutenant on 13 December of the same year. After six months' training at Chatham Grant was sent to Scotland. In February 1857 he was transferred to the Jamaica command in the West Indies, and at the end of 1858 he served on the staff as fort adjutant at Belise in British Honduras. He passed first in the examination for the Staff College, just established; but after a few months there (Jan.\u2013May 1859) he was aide-de-camp to Lieut.-general Sir William Fenwick Williams, the commander of the forces in North America for six years. On 8 August 1860 he was promoted second captain. He was at home for the final examination at the Staff College, in which he again easily passed first, despite his absence from the classes, and from January to June 1861 he was attached to the cavalry and artillery at Aldershot.\nFinally returning from Canada in June 1865, Grant did duty at Chatham, Dover, and Portsmouth, and was promoted first captain on 10 July 1867 and major on 5 July 1872. From 1 January 1871 to 1877 he was deputy assistant adjutant-general for royal engineers at the war office, and from 1877 was in command of the royal engineers troops, consisting of the pontoon, telegraph, equipment and depot units at Aldershot. He was promoted lieut.-colonel on 1 July 1878. In May 1880 he was appointed commanding royal engineer of the Plymouth subdistrict, and on 31 December 1881 commanding royal engineer of the Woolwich district. He was promoted colonel in the army on 1 July 1882, and a year later was placed on half pay. He remained unemployed until 5 May 1884, when he was given the R.E. command in Scotland, with the rank of colonel on the staff.\nOn 20 March 1885 he left Edinburgh suddenly for Egypt to join Lord Wolseley, who had telegraphed for his services, as colonel on the staff and commanding royal engineer with the Nile expeditionary force. He served with the headquarters staff and afterwards in command of the Abu Fatmeh district during the evacuation, but he was taken seriously ill with fever and was invalided home in August. For his services he was mentioned in despatches of 13 June 1885 (Lond. Gazette, 25 August 1885). Not anticipating so speedy a termination to the campaign, the authorities had filled up his appointment in Scotland and he had to wait nearly a year on half pay.\nOn 1 July 1886 Grant was appointed deputy adjutant-general for royal engineers at the war office. On 25 May 1889 he was created C.B., military division, and on 23 October made a temporary major-general. Before he had quite completed his five years as deputy adjutant-general Grant was appointed to the important post of inspector-general of fortifications (18 April 1891), with the temporary rank of lieut.-general, dated 29 April 1891. He succeeded to the establishment of major-generals on 9 May 1891, and became lieut.-general on 4 June 1897. As inspector-general of fortifications Grant was an ex-officio member of the joint naval and military committee on defence, and president of the colonial defence committee. During his term of office important works of defence and of barrack construction were carried out, under the loan for defences and military works loan. His services were so highly valued that they were retained for two years beyond the usual term. He was promoted K.C.B. on 20 May 1896. On leaving the war office (17 April 1898) Grant's work was highly commended by the secretaries of state for war and the colonies, and he was awarded a distinguished service pension of 100l. a year. He was given the G.C.B. on 26 June 1902, and retired from the service on 28 March 1903. His health was failing, and he died on 8 January 1904 at his residence, 14 Granville Place, Portman Square, London, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.\nAlways cool and self-contained, Grant was gifted with a sure judgment and a retentive memory. A portrait in oils by C. Lutyens, painted in 1897, hangs in the R.E. officers' mess at Aldershot, and a replica was in Lady Grant's possession. She also had a portrait in oils of Sir Robert Grant by Henty, painted in 1887. He married in London, on 24",
    "Swiss waitress and national symbol\nGilberte Montavon de Courgenay  (20 March 1896 \u2013 2 May 1957) was a Swiss waitress who became a national symbol of spiritual national defense during World War I and World War II. She entertained Swiss Army troops at the H\u00f4tel de Gare in Courgenay, which was owned by her family, and became popular with the soldiers. In 1917, the composer and folklorist Hanns In der Gand gave a concert at the hotel and performed his new song La petite Gilberte, written about Montavon. The song was adopted by the army to boost morale throughout the war. Montavon inspired Rudolph Bolo M\u00e4glin's 1939 novel Gilberte de Courgenay and his play of the same name. Two films, August Kern's Marguerite et les soldates in 1940 and Franz Schnyder's Gilberte de Courgenay in 1941, were based on her life.\nEarly life\nMontavon was born on 20 March 1896 in Courgenay to Gustave Montavon, a watchmaker and hotelier, and Lucine Laville. She was born on the first floor of her family home on Fontaine-All\u00e9e. She had two older sisters, Fernande and Camille, and two younger brothers, Gustave and Paul.\nMontavon was sent to a boarding school in German-speaking Alemania for her education. In 1914, Montavon returned from school, due to the war, and began working as a waitress at her parent's hotel, the H\u00f4tel de Gare.\nNational symbol\nPainting of Montavon on the side of a building\nDuring World War I, she entertained Swiss Army soldiers who were stationed in Ajoie, including many Swiss-German speakers. She was fluent in Swiss-French and Swiss German and would serve as a translator between the German-speaking troops and the French-speaking municipal officials. She would also repair uniforms and play the piano for soldiers visiting the hotel.\nThe 1949 painting Gilberte de Courgenay\nIn 1915, the composer and folklorist Hanns In der Gand visited Courgenay to collect popular songs to pass on to the troops. On 11 October 1917, In der Gand gave a concert at the H\u00f4tel de Gare where he performed his song about Montavon titled Le petite Gilberte de Courgenay in German and French. The song was adopted by the Swiss Army to boost morale throughout the war.\nIn 1939, Rudolph Bolo M\u00e4glin wrote a novel based on Montavon, titled Gilberte de Courgenay, and a stage play of the same name that was performed at the Schauspielhaus Z\u00fcrich and in Basel. In 1940, August Kern produced the film Marguerite et les soldates, loosely based on Montavon. In 1941, the filmmaker Franz Schnyder made a film, Gilberte de Courgenay, based on M\u00e4glin's novel. She was portrayed by Anne-Marie Blanc in the film.\nPersonal life\nMontavon's grave in Z\u00fcrich\nIn 1923, Montavon married Louis Schneider, a businessman from St. Gallen, in a Catholic ceremony at Mariastein Abbey in Metzerlen-Mariastein. The couple moved to Z\u00fcrich, where they lived at Bergstrasse 122. Gilberte gave birth to a daughter, Jeanne. The family moved to another house, located at Bionstrasse 10, where they settled permanently.\nDeath and legacy\nMontavon died in Z\u00fcrich on 2 May 1957 and was buried at the Friedhof Nordheim.\nA street and a bus station in Courgenay are named after her. In 1995, the filmmaker Jacqueline Veuve dedicated an episode of her television series, Ma rue histoire, to Montavon.\n",
    "Solar farm in Zambia\nThe Choma Solar Power Station is a solar power plant, under development in Zambia, with generation capacity of 60 megawatts and an attached 20 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). The privately owned solar farm is being developed by a joint venture company, comprising \"YEO Teknoloji Enerji ve Endustri AS\" (YEO), a  Turkish energy company and \"GEI Power Limited\", a Zambian independent power producer (IPP). The off-taker is ZESCO (Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited), the national electricity utility, under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).\nLocation\nThe power station would located in Choma District, in the Southen Province of Zambia. Choma, the district headquarters is located approximately 285 kilometres (177\u00a0mi), southwest of Lusaka, the national capital and the largest city in the country.\nOverview\nThis solar farm is the first grid-ready photovoltaic solar installation with an attached BESS in the country. The design calls for a ground-mounted solar panel layout, with maximum generation capacity of 60 megawatts. An attached 20 MWh BESS, based on lithium-battery technology will be incorporated in the design to allow the station to supply power even when sun is not up.\nDevelopers\nThe developers/owners of this power station have formed a special purpose vehicle (SPV) company to own, design, develop, construct, operate and maintain this power station. The name of the SPV company is Choma Solar Power Plant Limited. The ownership of the SPV company is as outlined in the table below.\nConstruction costs and timeline\nThe construction costs for the power station are reported as US$65 million. Construction is expected to begin in 2024, with commercial commissioning expected in September 2025. As of May 2024, the necessary feasibility, grid impact and environmental impact assessment studies had been concluded.\nOther considerations\nAs of April 2024, Zambia had installed generation capacity of 3,030 MW, of which 2,393 MW (79 percent) was derived from hydroelectric sources. Due to severe drought in the sub-region in recent months, the river levels are low and Zambian electricity output is low. As of February 2024, Zambia was grappling with a 500 MW deficit in electricity supply. This solar farm is expected to help to partially mitigate that shortage.\nSee also\nZambia portalRenewable energy portal\nList of power stations in Zambia\nZambia Riverside Solar Power Station\nItimpi Solar Power Station\n",
    "\nIndian-American physicist\nVidya Madhavan is an Indian American physicist who is Professor of Condensed Matter at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Her research considers the spin and charge of quantum materials. She combines high resolution characterization techniques with precise fabrication and growth techniques. She was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2015.\nEarly life and education\nMadhavan studied metallurgical engineering at the Indian Institutes of Technology. She remained there for her graduate studies, where she worked on solid state physics and materials science. She moved to the United States for her doctoral research, where she joined Boston University. After earning her PhD, Madhavan joined the University of California, Berkeley as a postdoctoral researcher.\nResearch and career\nIn 2002, Madhavan was appointed to the faculty at Boston College, where she found that phonons (lattice vibrations) were involved in superconductivity. She moved to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as a professor in 2014. Her research considers the interaction between spin, charge and structure in quantum materials. She has developed (spin-polarized) scanning tunnelling microscopy to understand emergent phenomena in unconventional superconductors, topological systems and two-dimensional materials. She has studied unconventional superconductors (with a focus on chiral superconductors), which maintain their superconductivity when in the presence of high magnetic fields likely due to the presence of Majorana particles on their surfaces. Madhavan used STM to identify these Majorana quasiparticles on the surface of uranium ditelluride.\nTopological insulators exhibit spin momentum locking, a quantum phenomenon in which the spin of an electron depends on its direction of travel. Madhavan has observed spin-polarized tunnelling in anti-feromagnets.\nMadhavan has pursued quantum systems with long lifetimes for quantum information science. She is particularly interested in Mott insulators, which can be fabricated using exfoliation and controlled using lithography. She has demonstrated that they can achieve lifetimes of a few seconds at room temperature.\nAwards and honors\n2015 Elected Fellow of the American Physical Society\nFellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research\n2020 Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Fellow\n2023 Appointed Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\nSelected publications\nMadhavan V V; Chen W; Jamneala T; Crommie MF; Wingreen NS (1 April 1998). \"Tunneling into a single magnetic atom: spectroscopic evidence of the kondo resonance\".

    "Species of striped earwig\nLabidura cryptera is an extant species of striped earwig from the genus Labidura of the family Labiduridae. The species is commonly known as the \"cryptic earwig\" due to its elusive behavior and preference for damp, hidden, shelter.\nDescription\nLabidura cryptera can be identified by its elongated, flattened body. Adults can grow to 10 to 25 millimeters in length. The body of Labidura cryptera is bilaterally symmetrical and it sports a pair of membranous wings beneath its forewings. Individuals have black stripes that run the length of their body with a dark pattern on the back edge of the forewings. Like all earwigs, Labidura cryptera has a pair of pincers or cerci of the back of the abdomen.\nRange\nLabidura cryptera is found in small regions of China in very specific habitats.\nEcology\nThe earwig prefers dark, moist environments under some sort of cover or shelter in the daytime. It is a primarily nocturnal insect doing most of its activity under the cover of night. Labidura cryptera can be found in coastal and inland dunes with vegetation and cover.\nLabidura cryptera is an omnivorous insect and very generalistic when it comes to feeding. It will eat plant matter, hunt smaller insects and larvae, and also eat decaying matter. due to its willingness to eat insects and decaying matter, Labidura cryptera plays an essential role in agriculture, as many farmers will use it as pest control.\nNesting and life cycle\nWhen the time comes, female specimens will find a dark covered area usually under a rock or tree bark, and using its specialized mouth parts, it will begin digging a nesting chamber that will serve multiple purposes, such as laying eggs and as a safe place to molt. Females lay eggs one at a time and usually lay around 30-50 eggs at once and are arranged in a cluster. The female will guard and groom the eggs while also collecting food for herself and for when the eggs hatch. After around 10 days, the eggs begin to hatch and the mother will maintain and protect the nymphs until they become independent and can leave the nest. Females can repeat this process up to three times in their lifetime.\n",
    "Constituency in Seoul, South Korea\nEunpyeong A (Korean:\u00a0\uc740\ud3c9\uad6c \uac11)  is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Eunpyeong District, Seoul. As of 2024, 219,044 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Seodaemun\u2013Eunpyeong constituency.\nHistory\nSince its establishment, Eunpyeong A has elected members of the Democratic Party and predecessor parties in all but two elections and is thus regarded as a stronghold for the Democratic Party.\nOh Yu-bang of the right-wing Democratic Justice Party was the first member to represent the constituency, narrowly defeating Cho Dong-hoe of the Peace Democratic Party. Oh was succeeded by Son Sae-il of the centrist-liberal Democratic Party after losing re-election in the 1992 election. Son won re-election in 1996, defeating Kang In-sop of the centre-right Grand National Party. Son was defeated by Kang In-sop in the following election by a margin of around 5,000 votes, marking the last time a conservative party candidate won in Eunpyeong A. In the 2004 election, Lee Mi-kyung of the liberal Uri Party won the seat, securing 51.79% of the vote. Lee won re-election in 2008 and 2012, receiving 45.82 and 49.05% of the vote respectively.\nAhead of the 2016 South Korean legislative election, the Democratic Party then led by Kim Chong-in, did not re-nominate incumbent Lee Mi-kyung for the Eunpyeong A constituency. The party instead nominated lawyer Park Joo-min as its candidate on March 20, 2016. Park went on to win the general election with 54.93% of the vote, defeating opponents Choi Hong-jae and Choi Sang-hyeon of the Saenuri Party and Labor Party respectively. Park won re-election in a landslide in 2020, securing 64.29% of the vote and defeating United Future Party opponent Hong In-jung. The 2024 election saw rematch between incumbent Park Joo-min and Hong In-jung; Park won re-election with 60.78% of the vote.\nBoundaries\nThe constituency consists of the neighborhoods of Nokbeon-dong, Yeokchon-dong, Jeungsan-dong, Sinsa-dong, Eungam-dong, Susaek-dong.

He specialized in Yemeni history. Some narrations from him are present in The Book of Crowns on the Kings of Himyar, a semi-legendary book about the rulers of the Himyarite Kingdom.\nLife\nThe birth date of 'Ubayd bin Shari'a al-Jurhami is unknown. However, he was a contemporary of Muawiyah and also met him in the year 660. He died in 686 during the rule of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, the fourth Umayyad Caliph. His age is disputed upon amongst historians; 'Ubayd told Muawiyah that he was 240 years old, something which the latter refused to believe, while 'Ubayd himself has also said that he is 150 years old in some of his works. Another narrative also states that he lived for at least three hundred years. Zarif Marzouk denied the ages stated in the narratives, and came to the conclusion that 'Ubayd died much lesser than what had been stated previously.\nHistoricity\nExistence\nSome scholars have disputed whether 'Ubayd bin Shari'a was a real person. Qarunqu denied his existence, and instead concluded that he was a character invented by the historian Ibn al-Nadim, the author of the Fihrist.\nAuthenticity\nHamilton Gebb mentioned that 'Ubayd did provide the Arabs with early historical information that lacked historical senses. Jawad Ali, on the other hand, accused 'Ubayd of taking stories from Arabian Jewish tales and folklore.\nAbdul Aziz al-Douri regarded any narrations of 'Ubayd as mere folktales and poetic imaginary stories of Yemeni history.\nWorks\nThe book Kitab al-Muluk wa al-Akhbar al-Madhi was attributed to 'Ubayd bin Shari'a, and a more recent copy was first printed in Hyderabad in 1928, while another older copy still exists in the British Museum. This book, however, is disputed in terms of its authenticity.\nSee also\nWahb ibn Munabbih\nAl-Tabari\nIbn Kathir\n",

    "Elbe Slavic prince of the Nakonid family\nFirst mention of Mistislaw as Mistizlavus in the chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg from ca. 1018 (facsimile). SLUB Dresden, Msc. R 147, sheet 178 b.\nMistislaw, also known as Mstislav (d. after 1018), was an Elbe Slavic prince of the Nakonid lineage and ruled over the Obotrites in what is now Mecklenburg and eastern Holstein from 990/995 to 1018.\nThe Nakonids were among the most powerful Christian Slavic princes in the second half of the 10th century. In the retinue of the Saxon Duke Bernhard I, Mistislaw participated in Otto II's campaign against the Saracens in southern Italy in 982, from which he returned with only a few survivors. In the subsequent Slavic revolt of 983, the Nakonids relinquished their sovereignty over several Obotrite branches to the victorious Lutici. Upon the death of his father, Mstivoj, in 990 or 995, Mistislaw attempted to establish royal rule over the remaining peoples. While he managed to secure the support of the Church and the Empire, the opposition within the Obotrites joined forces with the Lutici. From 1003 onwards, Mistislaw's ability to secure Saxon support was eroded by Henry II's alliance with the Lutici against the Polish prince Boleslaw I. This ultimately resulted in Mistislaw's inability to assert his authority. In February 1018, the Lutici invaded the Obotrite kingdom, incited unrest among the population, and compelled Mistislaw to seek refuge in the Saxon Bardengau.\nThe majority of recent research views Mistislaw as a Christian Slavic prince with close ties to the Holy Roman Empire. This research suggests that his attempt to reorganise the Obotrite kingdom from a personal state to a territorial state failed, despite the support of the Church and the Saxon duchy.\nLife\nOrigin and family\nMistislaw, also known as Mistizlavus and Missizla in historical sources, was the son of the Obotritic sovereign (Samtherrscher), Mstivoj. He had two sisters, Tove and Hodica. A marriage to the niece of the Saxon Duke Bernhard I was unsuccessful in 983 due to the opposition of Dietrich of Haldensleben. Mistislaw had a son, Pribignew, with an unknown wife, who assumed control of the confederation around 1020 with the support of Danish and Saxon forces.\nCampaign against the Saracens in southern Italy\nBefore assuming the role of ruler, Mistislaw participated in Emperor Otto II's Italian campaign in 982 as a representative of the Nakonid family. At the head of a delegation of Obotrite armoured horsemen, he crossed the Alps in 981/982 in the wake of the Saxon Duke Bernhard I to reinforce the imperial army in the southern part of the empire. At this juncture, the emperor initiated a military campaign against the Saracens, who had advanced from Sicily to the southern Italian mainland under the leadership of their emir Abu al-Qasim. The contingent led by Mistislaw is said to have consisted of 1,000 armoured horsemen. By medieval standards, this number is hardly believable, particularly when one considers that the emperor had only requested a total of 2090 armoured riders from the northern part of the empire in his call-up order. Nevertheless, the number of Obotrite warriors must have been exceptionally high, as Bernhard I promised the marriage of his niece to Mistislaw in return for their participation in the campaign, thus creating a dynastic connection between the two princely houses. While Bernhard I was compelled to return to the north at an early stage due to an invasion by the Danes, the vast majority of the Abodrites perished in Italy. Although their ultimate fate remains unknown, it seems likely that they participated in the Battle of Cape Colonna, in which the imperial army was decisively defeated on 15 July 982.\nMistislaw returned to Mecklenburg with the few survivors. Upon demanding the fulfilment of the marriage promise, Count Dietrich von Haldensleben refused to provide him with the bride, stating that a duke's blood relative should not be given to a dog. It seems probable that Dietrich's reasons for opposing a dynastic union between the Billungers and the Nakonids were power-political. As Margrave of the Nordmark, he competed with the Billungers and Nakonids for influence in the Circipanian territory, which was traditionally subject to Obotrite rule. Conversely, it seems unlikely that Dietrich's ethnic reservations about a marriage between the Slavic prince's son and the Saxon princess were a significant factor in his opposition to the union. Such unions were not uncommon at the time. In 978, Dietrich himself had sponsored the marriage of his eldest daughter Oda to the Polish prince Mieszko I, and his other daughter Mathilde had married the Hevelli prince Pribislaw. Mistislaw's father, Mstivoj, was married to the sister of the Oldenburg bishop, Wago, and a relative of the Saxon duke, Bernhard I, Weldrud, had been given in marriage to the Wagrian prince, Sederich.\nSovereignty\nAs the sovereign of the Obotrite confederation, Mistislaw ruled ov",

    "Lifeboat station in Northumberland\nSeahouses Lifeboat Station is located in the village of Seahouses, in the county of Northumberland. \nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Crewe Trustees in 1827. The station was taken over by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1859. Originally known as North Sunderland Lifeboat Station, the name was formally changed to Seahouses Lifeboat Station in 1999.\nThe station currently operates a Shannon-class All-weather lifeboat 13-36 John and Elizabeth Allan (ON 1343), and a D-class (IB1) Inshore lifeboat Grace Darling (D-828).\nHistory\nWhen a harbour was created near the village of North Sunderland in Northumberland, it gradually developed to become the separate village of Seahouses. Over the years, the two villages grew in size, and have now effectively merged.\nA new lifeboat station was established in North Sunderland in 1827 by the Crewe Trustees, a charitable organisation founded by Nathaniel Crewe, Bishop of Durham in 1704. A stone-built boathouse was constructed, and a lifeboat transferred here from Holy Island, a 31-foot 10-oared boat, built by Henry Greathead in 1802. There are no records of any service by this lifeboat, which was replaced in 1838 by a 27-foot lifeboat, designed by Capt. John Foulerton, RN, and built by Shore.\nOn 7 September 1838, the paddle steamer Forfarshire ran aground on the Farne Island Rocks and broke in two. Much is available to read of the subsequent heroism of Grace Darling and her father William Darling. The North Sunderland lifeboat did not launch to the wreck, the coxswain instead opting for a small coble that he believed more suited to effect a rescue around the rocks. One of the seven crew was William Darling, brother of Grace. They battled to arrive at the wreck, only to find the rescue had been completed, but unable to return home due to the weather, they then spent 2 days seeking shelter in a disused building, all other 'accommodation' at the Farne Island Lighthouse being full.\nWhen the 1838 lifeboat was deemed unfit for service in 1851, an order was placed with Forrestt of Limehouse, London for a 30-foot 'Self-righting', similar in design to the James Beeching lifeboat, which had won the prize awarded by the president of the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland.\nIn 1859, the secretary of the Crewe Trustees requested that the RNLI take over the management of the North Sunderland Lifeboat Station, for which the trustees would give a grant of \u00a330 per annum to the RNLI. The existing 30-foot lifeboat was never launched on service for the RNLI, who in 1865 decided to replace it. A 33-foot 10-oared self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, (one using oars and sail), was built by Forrestt of Limehouse, London, costing \u00a3274-19s-3d, and a new launch carriage cost a further \u00a3102-11s-0d. The lifeboat and carriage were transported to North Sunderland free of charge by the Great Northern and North Eastern railway companies. At a ceremony on 12 June, the boat was named Joseph Anstice by the donor, Mrs Anstice of Tynemouth.\nThomas Pringle retired in May 1886 after serving as Coxswain for 21 years. As was common practice, he was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal in recogniton of his many service calls. Only 17 months later, he would drown in a boating accident on 6 October 1887.\nRNLB Lizzie Porter (ON 597)\nNorth Sunderland would receive their first motor-powered lifeboat in 1936, the non-self-righting Liverpool-class lifeboat, with a 35\u00a0hp petrol engine, delivering a speed of 7.47 knots. A new boathouse nearer the harbour was constructed. Previously, P&S lifeboats had cost a few hundred pounds. Costing \u00a33,447, the cost was met from the combined funds of three legacies, and the boat was in effect given three names, The William and James, the Ridge Matthews, and the Abigail Gardiner, each chosen by the donor. At a ceremony on 5 September 1936, the boat was formally named W.R.A. (ON 781) by Helen Percy, Duchess of Northumberland. Each name was inscribed on a plaque inside the boat.\nA D-class (RFD PB16) Inshore lifeboat would be stationed at North Sunderland in 1964. The rise in leisure activity at the coast demanded a quick response vessel, and these boats would quickly show their value. In the first 35 years on station to 1999, the inshore boats would launch just over 300 times, saving 85 lives.\nMersey-class 12-16 Grace Darling\nIn 1991, a new boathouse was constructed to house the Mersey-class lifeboat 12-16 Grace Darling (ON 1173) and Talus launch tractor, with improved crew facilities, and storage for the D-class.On 9 April 1999, on the request of station personnel, the RNLI agreed that North Sunderland station be formally renamed Seahouses Lifeboat Station with immediate effect.\nFor two years, the station had the unusual occurrence of having two lifeboats with the same name, the new D-class (IB1) also being named Grace Darling (D-828) in 2018",

    "British major-general in the royal engineers\nEdward John Lake CSI (19 June 1823 \u2013 7 June 1877) was a British major-general in the Royal Engineers.\nBiography\nLake born at Madras on 19 June 1823. He was the son of Edward Lake (d. 1829), major in the Madras engineers, who served with distinction in the Mahratta war of 1817, and was author of \u2018Sieges of the Madras Army.\u2019 Sent to England with a sister at an early age, Edward was left an orphan when six years old by the foundering at sea of the ship Guildford, in which his parents with their four younger children were on passage home. He was brought up by his grandfather, Admiral Sir Willoughby Lake, who placed him at a private school at Wimbledon. He afterwards entered the military college of the East India Company at Addiscombe, and passed through the course in three terms instead of the usual four. He obtained a commission as second lieutenant in the Bengal engineers on 11 June 1840. After a year at the royal engineers' establishment at Chatham, he went to India, and was posted to the Bengal sappers and miners at Delhi.\nShortly after his arrival at Delhi, Lake was sent with a company of sappers to suppress an outbreak at Kythul, near Kurnaul. He there made the acquaintance of Henry and John Lawrence, and was employed for a time in road-making under the former. He was promoted lieutenant on 19 February 1844. During the autumn of 1845 he served as a settlement officer in the Umballa district under Major Broadfoot. On the outbreak of the Sikh war in the same year he was ordered to the Sutlej, and joined Lord Hardinge in time to be present at the battle of Moodkee on 20 December, when he had a horse shot under him and was himself severely wounded in the hand. After the battle he was sent to the frontier station of Loodiana, where he strengthened the defences and forwarded troops and supplies to the army in the field. When Sir Harry Smith's camp equipage fell into the hands of the enemy just before the battle of Aliwal, Lake was able to replace it, and received the commendation of the governor-general for his zeal and promptness. He was present at the battle of Aliwal, and received a medal and clasp for his services in the campaign.\nOn the restoration of peace in March 1846, the trans-Sutlej territory of the Jalundhur Doab was made over to the British as a material guarantee. John Lawrence was appointed commissioner for the newly acquired territory, and Lake was nominated one of his assistants and placed in charge of the Kangra district, with headquarters at Noorpoor, whence he was soon moved to Jalundhur.\nIn May 1848, when Sir Henry Lawrence, the commissioner of the Punjab, had left India on furlough to England, open hostility was manifested by Mulraj, governor of Mooltan, and his turbulent Sikhs; Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew and Lieutenant Anderson were foully murdered, and the Punjab was in a blaze. Herbert Edwardes, who was in political charge of the Dera Ismail Khan district and nearest to Mooltan, hastily collected a body of Pathans and managed to hold his own against Mulraj. Lake was specially selected as political officer to the nawab of Bahawalpoor, a friendly Mahometan chief, whose territories adjoined the Punjab, and in virtual command of the nawab's troops he co-operated with his old friend Edwardes. He took part on 1 July in the second battle of Suddoosam, close to Mooltan, and for seven months was engaged in the operations for the reduction of Mooltan before it fell. During these stirring times Lake, then only a lieutenant like Edwardes, was in fact commander-in-chief of the Davodpootra army, and although directed to co-operate with Edwardes, and in no way under his orders, he nevertheless magnanimously subordinated himself, and was content to do his utmost to further his friend's plans (Edwardes, A Year in the Punjab). On the fall of Mooltan, Lake was again in the field, and took part in the final victory of Gujerat on 21 February 1849. He accompanied General Gilbert to the Indus in his pursuit of the Afghans, and was present at Rawul Pindee when the Sikh army laid down its arms. The war over, Lake received a medal and two clasps. Going to Batala, he next had charge, under John (afterwards Lord) Lawrence, for two years of the northern portion of the country between the rivers Beas and Ravee. In 1852 he went home on furlough, travelling through Russia, Prussia, Norway, and Sweden. He returned to India in 1854, having been promoted captain on 21 August, and a brevet-major on 22 August for his services in the Punjab campaign. He took up his old charge in the trans-Sutlej province at Kangra as deputy-commissioner. In 1855 he was appointed commissioner of the Jalundhur Doab. When the mutiny broke out in 1857, Lake occupied and secured the fort of Kangra against the rebels, and held it until the mutiny was suppressed. His calmness and resource were a tower of strength to the government throughout the crisis.\nIn 1860 his health failed, and he was obliged to",
    "Species of fish\nChaunax suttkissi, the pale-cavity gaper, spotted frogmouth, spotted gaper or Sutkus sea toad, is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Chaunacidae, the sea toads. This species is found in the Atlantic Ocean.\nTaxonomy\nChaunax suttkisi was first formally described in 1989 by the American ichthyologist John H. Caruso with its type locality given as off Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea at 11\u00b040'N, 62\u00b033'W, at a depth of 585\u2013622\u00a0m (1,919\u20132,041\u00a0ft). Within the genus Chaunax this species is placed in the Chaunax fimbriatus species group. The genus Chaunax is one of two genera classified by the 5th edition of the Fishes of the World within the family Chaunacidae, the sea toads. The sea toads are placed within the monotypic suborder Chaunacoidei within the anglerfish order Lophiiformes.\nEtymology\nChaunax, the genus name, means \"one who gapes\", from chanos meaning \"to gape\", an allusion to the large, wide mouths of these fishes. The specific name suttkusi, honours Royal D. Suttkus, an ichthyologist at Tulane University for his contributions to ichthyology and the extensive collection of fish specimens he collated during his career at the university.\nDescription\nChaunax suttkusi has a globular, slight compressed body which tapers to a small, rounded caudal fin. The large head is somewhat cuboid with small eyes which are covered in transparent skin. The large, oblique mouth is equipped with many small, thin, sharp vertical teeth and the gill opening is small. Of the three dorsal spines, two are embedded in the skin on the nape and only the first, the illicium is visible. The illicium is tipped with a lure, or esca which is a mop-like tuft of filaments. The illicium is lowered into a flat, concave depression on the snout when not being used to attract prey. The dorsal fin is on the rear of the body and contains between 10 and 12 soft rays while the anal fin has 6 or 7 soft rays. The loose, flabby skin has a dense covering of robust denticles. The lateral line is open and runs from from the caudal peduncle to the head, with obvious canals connecting to branches under the eye, on the chin and along the lower flanks. The main part of the lateral line on the upper body contains between 29 and 42 pores with between 11 and 13 pores on the head. The overall colour is pale pink to rosy pink, with red on the top and sides of the head and fins and the undersides of both the head and body are whitish. The cavity on the snout for the illicium is pale while the illicium and esca are uniform in color, varying from pale through to dusky with the filaments of the esca being black. This species has a maximum published total length of 26.7\u00a0cm (10.5\u00a0in) and a maximum published weight of 359\u00a0g (12.7\u00a0oz).\nDistribution and habitat\nChaunax suttkusi is found in the Atlantic Ocean. In the eastern Atlantic it occurs from Ireland south as far as Angola, its range includes the Azores, while in the western Atlantic it can be found from South Carolina as far south as the Rio Grande Rise. It has also been found in the Mediterranean Sea. The range of this species is thought to be extending northwards due to increasing temperatures as a result of climate change.This is a bathydemersal species found at depths between 220 and 1,060\u00a0m (720 and 3,480\u00a0ft) on soft bottoms on the continental shelf.\n",
    "Irish colonel in the Royal Engineers\nArthur Leahy (5 August 1830 \u2013 18 July 1878) was an Irish colonel in the Royal Engineers.\nBiography\nLeahy was the seventh son of John Leahy, esq., J.P., of South Hill, Killarney. He was born 5 August 1830, and educated at Corpus Christi Hall, Maidstone, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He obtained a commission as lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 27 June 1848, and, after completing his military studies at Chatham, was quartered in Ireland until 1853, and after that at Corfu.\nOn the outbreak of the war with Russia in 1854, he joined the army at Varna and proceeded with it to the Crimea. He was present at the battles of Alma and Inkerman. During the early part of the siege he was acting adjutant, and in charge of the engineer park of the left attack under Major (later General Sir) Frederick Chapman. In managing the park and the engineer transport train he first had an opportunity of showing his characteristic energy and industry. As the winter set in Leahy was appointed deputy-assistant quartermaster-general for the royal engineers. In the 'Journal of the Siege Operations,' published by authority, Leahy is credited with invaluable services in providing for the comfort and proper maintenance of the engineer troops. He received the Crimean war medal with three clasps, the Sardinian medal, the Turkish war medal and the 5th class of the Medjidie.\nFrom the Crimea he returned to Corfu in and became a second captain on 2 December. His brevet majority for service in the Crimea, which he received some time after, was antedated 8 December 1857. He returned home early in 1858, was stationed for a short time at Woolwich, and in June was appointed to the staff of the inspector-general of fortifications at the War Office. In 1864 he became assistant-director of works in the fortification branch of the War Office. When he went to the War Office, the defence of the home arsenals and dockyards had become a matter of urgency, and tie defence loan, the result of the royal commission on the defences of the United Kingdom of 1859, provided the necessary funds. The work thrown upon the fortification branch was enormous, and Leahy's share of it large. In addition to his regular work, he was a member of many committees, and in 1870 was secretary of that presided over by Lord Lansdowne on the employment of officers of royal engineers in the civil departments of the state.\nLeahy was employed at the Paris Exhibition of 1867, and made three able reports, which were published, on military hospitals and barrack buildings, on field hospital equipment, and on military telegraphy and signalling. He became a brevet lieutenant-colonel on 29 November 1868. In July 1871 he was appointed instructor of field works at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, and owing to his efforts the instruction in fieldworks and kindred subjects was made available not only for the whole regular army but also for the militia and volunteers, it was also due to his initiative that classes for pioneer sergeants of infantry were introduced, and he himself prepared the official manual for their instruction. He took considerable interest in the field park and its workshops, and brought them into a high state of efficiency. He was promoted to be regimental lieutenant-colonel 10 December 1873, and in March 1876 was sent to Gibraltar as second in command of the Royal Engineers. He was promoted brevet-colonel 1 October 1877. The following year he was attacked by rock fever, was taken home, and died on 18 July 1878 at Netley Hospital, Southampton. Leahy was twice married, first in 1857 to Miss Tabuteau, by whom he had two children; and secondly to Miss E. J. Poynter, by whom he had five children. He was the author of a pamphlet on army reorganisation, 1868, 8vo.\n",

    "\nEva Best (n\u00e9e, Williams; pen name, Saturn; 1851\u20131925) was an American story writer, poet, music composer, dramatist, and painter. She worked as a newspaper editor. She wrote a great deal in dialect.\nBest was among the first persons to recognize the poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar and was influential in bringing him before the public. In his youth, Dunbar was an elevator attendant in the same building in which Best's father conducted an architect's office, and she became acquainted with the youth and his literary endeavors through seeing him in her father's building.\nEarly life\nEva Williams was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, December 19, 1851. She was the eldest daughter of John Insco Williams and Mrs. Mary Williams, who removed to Chicago, Illinois. Her father was an artist and painted the first bible panorama ever exhibited in the United States. Her mother is also an artist of merit as well as a writer of verse and prose. Eva's brother, Charles Insco Williams, was an artist and architect. A sister, Lulu, married William I. Buchanan.\nCareer\nBest started her literary career as a poet. \"The Beautiful Thought\", \"Love and Hate\", \"A Promised Day\", and \"Thou Art\" are included in The New Cycle (1899), while \"The Power of Thought\" was included in the Bible Review (1905).\nShe began writing for the papers in 1871, encouraged to do so by W. D. Bickham, of the Dayton Journal (now, Dayton Daily News). In 1872, she began contributing to the Cincinnati Saturday Night, and afterward for The Cincinnati Times-Star, under the nom de plume of \"Saturn\". She then wrote for Godey's Magazine, for Arthur's Lady's Home Magazine , and for Peterson's Magazine. Her first short story appeared in one of the Frank Leslie's periodicals. That was followed by stories in other publications. In 1882, her services were sought by the editor of the Detroit Free Press, with Best becoming the editor of the household department of that paper. She was also a regular contributor to Ansel Nash Kellogg's Newspaper Company.

A Rhine Crystal was being used by Miss Floy Crowell, a New England artist. Best's other plays, The Little Banshee and Gemini, the former in Irish dialect, the latter a two-part character piece, were written for Miss Jennie Calef. In all these plays the music, dances, ballads and all incidental scores were distinctively original. In her dramatic work, she composed both the songs and the music with which her dramas were interspersed.\nBest wrote a number of ballads. One of her peculiar advantages in the writing of stories was her ability to sketch such illustrations as she required to visualize her thoughts. She devoted some attention to art.

    "English lieutenant-general and colonel-commandant in the Royal Engineers\nGriffith George Lewis (10 November 1784 \u2013 24 October 1859) was an English lieutenant-general and colonel-commandant in the Royal Engineers.\nBiography\nLewis was born at Woolwich on 10 November 1784. He was educated privately and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. On completing the course of study at the academy, he was sent with the next two senior cadets to the west of England to be instructed in surveying under Major William Mudge, before obtaining his commission in the Royal Engineers. He was gazetted second lieutenant on 15 March 1803, and lieutenant on 2 July the same year. After a year at Chatham he joined the Portsmouth command, and in May 1805 embarked with the expedition under Sir James Craig. He served for a time at Malta, and then took part in the campaign of Naples and Calabria. He was present at the battle of Maida on 4 July 1806, and after it joined Colonel Oswald's brigade in a projected attack on the castle of Scylla. They arrived before the place on the night of 11 July. Lewis and the English engineers laboured unceasingly in the construction of the siege batteries, from which fire was opened on the 21st. So great was the effect that on the following day the garrison capitulated. It consisted of some four hundred sappers and miners and artillerymen, being all the men of the technical corps of the Calabrian army, under Colonel Michel of the French engineers.\nLewis was promoted second captain on 18 November 1807. He served under Sir John Stuart at the capture of Ischia and Procida in the Bay of Naples in August 1809, and in the Ionian Islands under Sir John Oswald at the siege of Santa Maura in 1810. In February 1811 he returned to England, staying at Gibraltar on his way, and was stationed at Woolwich. On 10 July he embarked with the expedition for Sweden and the Danish island of Anhalt, and returning in September was sent to the eastern district. In December 1812 he embarked for Portugal, and was employed in throwing up the lines round Lisbon. In 1813 he served in the campaign in Spain under Wellington. He was promoted captain on 21 July 1813. At the siege of San Sebastian he was twice wounded, and in the assault of the breach on 25 July so severely, that his leg had to be amputated above the knee. He was mentioned in Lord Lynedoch's despatches as having distinguished himself by gallant conduct, and was promoted brevet major on 21 September for his services. The same month he returned to England invalided. After some time on the sick list he joined the army of occupation in France, and in the autumn of 1817 was employed on special service.\nOn 18 January 1819 he embarked for Newfoundland, where he served for some years. On 29 July 1825 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. He returned to England on 18 September 1827.

    "Arabic poetry composed between 540\u2013620 AD\nPre-Islamic Arabic poetry (or simply pre-Islamic poetry) refers to the corpus of Arabic poetry composed in pre-Islamic Arabia roughly between 540 and 620 AD.\nOne of the first major poets in the pre-Islamic era is Imru' al-Qais, the last king of the kingdom of Kinda. Although most of the poetry of that era was not preserved, what remains is well regarded as among the finest Arabic poetry to date. In addition to the eloquence and artistic value, pre-Islamic poetry constitutes a major source for classical Arabic language both in grammar and vocabulary, and as a reliable historical record of the political and cultural life of the time.\nPoetry held an important position in pre-Islamic society with the poet or sha'ir filling the role of historian, soothsayer and propagandist. Words in praise of the tribe (qit'ah) and lampoons denigrating other tribes (hija') seem to have been some of the most popular forms of early poetry. The sha'ir represented an individual tribe's prestige and importance in the Arabian peninsula, and mock battles in poetry or zajal would stand in lieu of real wars. 'Ukaz, a market town not far from Mecca, would play host to a regular poetry festival where the craft of the sha'irs would be exhibited.\nAlongside the sha'ir, and often as his poetic apprentice, was the rawi or reciter. The job of the rawi was to learn the poems by heart and to recite them with explanations and probably often with embellishments. This tradition allowed the transmission of these poetic works and the practice was later adopted by the huffaz for their memorisation of the Qur'an. At some periods there have been unbroken chains of illustrious poets, each one training a rawi as a bard to promote his verse, and then to take over from them and continue the poetic tradition. For example, Tufayl trained 'Awas ibn Hajar, 'Awas trained Zuhayr, Zuhayr trained his son Ka`b, Ka`b trained al-Hutay'ah, al-Hutay'ah trained Jamil Buthaynah and Jamil trained Kuthayyir `Azza.\nMajor collections\nThe five major collections of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry were made in the 8th and 9th centuries and are, alongside published editions and translations:\nThe Mu'allaqat (\"The Suspended Odes\" or \"The Hanging Poems\"), a group of seven long poems collected in the 8th century.

    "1983 studio album by Mark Murphy\nBrazil Song (Canc\u00f5es Do Brasil) is a studio album by Mark Murphy.\nBrazil Song (Canc\u00f5es Do Brasil) is the 20th album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 51 years old in 1983 and released by the Muse label in the United States in 1984. This album is collection of Brazilian jazz songs.\nBackground\nMark Murphy had a fondness for Brazilian songs. Murphy had recorded Brazilian music previously on Mark Murphy Sings (\"Empty Faces\"), Who Can I Turn To (\"Star Sounds\"), Midnight Mood (\"Sconsolato\"), and others. However, Brazil Song was Murphy's first all-Brazilian jazz album. He later released Night Mood in 1987 dedicated to Ivan Lins. He continued to record many Brazilian songs during his career, singing many of them in Portuguese. In his book A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, Will Friedwald pointed out that Murphy dedicated his late nightclub sets to Brazilian rhythms in his Birdland engagements.\nAfter touring in 1982 Murphy spent two weeks in Rio. He absorbed the music and culture and collected recordings of Brazilian jazz. He was inspired to do an album devoted to the music. In the liner notes to Brazil Song, he told Michael Bloom, \"We've lost the great era of singer/songwriters and the Broadway stage. They write musicals but they don't write songs anymore - not songs you can take out and do as independent numbers. I don't hear much new material that knocks me out. So, the best songs now being written are coming from Brazil. It's almost as though they\u2019ve written into the Brazilian Constitution that it is illegal to write a bad song\u201d.\nAlso in the liner notes Murphy writes about his experience visiting a museum dedicated to Carmen Miranda \"who personally brought the Samba (her country's gift to popular music) to the USA and the world\". He had been a longtime fan of Miranda after seeing her movies. Murphy dedicated the album to her and to \"Elis Regina, the greatest of the contemporary Brazilian singers - who brought us so much joy and excitement and died much too soon\" who \"must be mentioned in this dedication as well, as must my two new favorite Brazilian lady singers. Rose and Leny Andrade\".\nRecording\n\"No one asked me to make this album\", Murphy told Bloom in the liner notes. \"I did it because I thought that Brazilian songs were not being done correctly - that North American singers have not been able to capture the correct musical pulse of this music, mainly because of the Tin-Pan-Alleyish lyrics given to some of the tunes. The rhythmic pulse has a different timing; I think that's a quality inherent in the Portuguese language. So I try to sing the English lyrics as though they were Portuguese.\"\nThe recording was made with a San Francisco-based group, Viva Brasil, who Murphy found to be authentic interpreters of Brazilian songs. \"I knew I couldn't do this project with a pickup group,\" Murphy explained to Bloom. \"I had to have a unit, musicians that knew each other well.\" Jay Wagner, Viva Brasil's keyboardist, did the arranging and played synthesizer. The other members included singer Julia Stewart, percussionist Michael Spiro, pianist Michael Austin-Boe, guitarist Claudio Amaral, and drummer Rubens Moura.\nMurphy sings \"Outubro\" in Portuguese, his first recording in Portuguese. Jones points out in his Murphy biography that many singers prefer original lyrics in Brazilian songs because the English versions tend to drastically change the original meaning. Murphy produced the album with Lupe De Leon, who had worked on Stolen Moments and would go on to produce Night Mood and September Ballads.\nReception\nScott Yanow assigns 3 stars to this release in the AllMusic Guide to Jazz.\nAuthour Will Friedwald said, \u201cWhen it comes to the bossa nova, no other American jazz singer can touch Murphy\u201d.\nMurphy biographer Peter Jones singles out \"Two Kites\", \"Nothing Will Be\", and \"Bridges\" for praise.\nTrack listing\n\"Desafinado\" (Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, Newton Mendon\u00e7a) \u2013 4:02\n\"Two Kites\" (Jobim) \u2013 3:36\n\"The Island\" (Ivan Lins, V\u00edtor Martins) \u2013 4:03\n\"Bolero De Sat\u00e3\" (Paulo Cesar Pinheiro, Guinga) \u2013 3:49\n\"She\" (Claudio Amaral) \u2013 2:58\n\"Someone To Light Up My Life (Se Todos Fossem Iguais A Voce)\" (Jobim, Gene Lees, Vinicius de Moraes) \u2013 2:57\n\"Nothing Will Be\" (Ronaldo Bastos, Milton Nascimento, Renee Vincent) \u2013 3:57\n\"Outubro (October)\" (Nascimento, Fernando Brant) \u2013 3:58\n\"Bridges\" (Brant, Lees, Nascimento) \u2013 3:59\nPersonnel\nPerformance\nMark Murphy \u2013 vocals\nMichael Austin-Boe \u2013 piano\nClaudio Amaral \u2013 guitar\nRubens Moura \u2013 drums\nChalo Eduardo \u2013 percussion\nMichael Spiro \u2013 percussion\nJulia Stewart \u2013 vocals\nJay Wagner \u2013 synthesizer, arranger\nProduction\nJack Leahy \u2013 engineer, Russian Hill Recording, San Francisco, Ca.

    "English general and colonel-commandant in the Royal Engineers\nJohn Oldfield KH (29 May 1789 \u2013 2 August 1863) was an English general and colonel-commandant in the Royal Engineers.\nBiography\nOldfield was the only son of John Nicholls Oldfield, lieutenant in the royal marines, who served with distinction on the staff of the army and with the 63rd regiment in the American war, and of Elizabeth, only daughter of Lieutenant Hammond of the royal navy. He was born at Portsmouth on 29 May 1789. He was descended from Sir Anthony Oldfield, created a baronet in 1660, and he claimed to be fifth baronet, but the proof was incomplete. A re-creation was deemed to be necessary, the cost of which Oldfield declined to incur, and the matter dropped. His father retired from the service about the date of Oldfield's birth, and purchased a small estate at Westbourne, Sussex. He died in 1793.\nIn 1799 Oldfield's uncle, Major Thomas Oldfield, of the royal marines, was killed at St. Jean d'Acre. The distinguished conduct of this officer led to offers from Lord St. Vincent, Lord Nelson, and Sir Sidney Smith to provide for John Oldfield in the navy, while Earl Spencer offered a commission in the royal marines, and the Marquis Cornwallis a nomination for the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. The latter was accepted. When Oldfield was old enough to go to Woolwich, he was only four feet six inches high, and a dispensing order had to be obtained from the master-general of the ordnance to allow of his admission to the Royal Military Academy, the minimum standard being then four feet nine inches. The junior cadets at that time went first to Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where he joined, on 23 August 1803, and was afterwards transferred to Woolwich. When George III inspected the cadets on 29 May 1805, Oldfield was one of the seniors. The king was struck with his diminutive stature, asked his name and age, and spoke to the lad of his uncle's services at St. Jean d'Acre.\nOldfield joined the Trigonometrical Survey at Bodmin in Cornwall in September 1805. He was commissioned as second lieutenant in the royal engineers on 2 April 1806, and quartered at Portsmouth. He was promoted to be lieutenant on 1 July. The following summer he was sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and after two years' service in North America he returned to England, and in September 1809 was stationed at Dorchester. He was promoted second captain on 1 May 1811.\nFrom Dorchester he went to Fort George in Scotland, and remained there until he embarked for Holland in 1814. He landed at Hellevoetsluis on 28 March, and entered Antwerp with Sir Thomas Graham on 5 May. He was promoted captain on 26 January 1815. He was at Brussels on 7 April 1815, when he heard of Napoleon's escape from Elba, and at once packed his family off to England, to Westbourne. Oldfield was sent to Ypres to construct new works of defence, and was entrusted with the inundation of the country round, a troublesome and thankless operation. He shortly after joined the army of the Duke of Wellington as brigade-major of royal engineers. He made a sketch-plan of the plains of Waterloo for the use of the duke, and took part in the battle of Waterloo and the occupation of Paris. In April 1819, in consequence of a reduction in the corps of royal engineers, he was placed on half-pay, and passed his time chiefly at Westbourne.\nIn October 1823 he was sent on a special commission to the West Indies. He returned in 1824, and was quartered for some years in Ireland. On 23 July 1830 he was promoted brevet-major and made a K.H. for his services in 1815. In September he was appointed commanding royal engineer in Newfoundland. On 19 November 1831 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. In October 1835 he returned to England, and was appointed to the command of the royal engineers at Jersey. In March 1839 he was sent to Canada as commanding royal engineer and colonel on the staff. He was there during the rebellion and rendered good service. On 9 November 1841 he was promoted colonel in the army, and appointed aide-de-camp to the queen. He returned from Canada in the spring of 1843, and was appointed commanding royal engineer in the western district. He was promoted regimental colonel on 9 November 1846, and was appointed to command the royal engineers in Ireland in 1848. On 20 June 1854 he was promoted major-general, and went to live at Westbourne. He became lieutenant-general on 10 May 1859. He was made a colonel-commandant of the corps of royal engineers on 25 October 1859, and was promoted general on 3 April 1862. He died at Emsworth on 2 August 1863, and was buried at Westbourne.\nOldfield was thrice married: first, on 12 March 1810, at Dorchester, to Mary, daughter of Christopher Ardens, esq., of Dorchester, Dorset, by whom he had seven children (she died at Le Mans, France, on 6 July 1820); secondly, on 8 July 1822, at Cheltenham, to Alicia, daughter of the Rev. T. Hume, rector of Arden, by whom he had eight children (she died at Pl",

The building was conceived in 1959 by architect Gerald Robinson, whose design was influenced by the work of Le Corbusier. Construction began in 1961 and the building opened in the fall of 1963, though it was not completed until the spring of 1964. The building occupies a property owned by Victoria University that was leased in 1961 for 100 years. When it opened, the building contained stores, a theatre, offices, and apartments. The Colonnade is one of the earliest examples of brutalist architecture in Canada.\nHistory and design\nIn 1959, architect Gerald Robinson (1930\u2013) and engineer Irwin Burns (d. 2016) met at a Toronto Film Society programme. The men had a coffee at the end of the evening and talked about the decline of cities and how to revitalise them. The following morning, a real estate developer named Murray Webber (d. 2008) telephoned Burns to tell him about a property on Bloor Street, owned by Victoria University, that was available for long-term lease and development. At noon that day, Burns went to Bloor to look at the property. By chance, he ran into Robinson on the street. As the two examined the property, Burns said, \"there is the place to demonstrate what we talked about last night.\"\nBurns and Webber formed a corporation called One Thirty One Bloor West Limited, of which Burns was the president and general manager. The corporation owned half the project, while the other half was owned by Arthur Minden (1910\u20131966). In Robinson's telling, \"the inspiration came from Burns, the respectability from Webber, and the money from Minden.\" The group's proposal won out over 25 other projects submitted to Victoria University for the site. Burns and Webber announced the project on 5 October 1961. The 100-year lease they acquired from Victoria was the largest ground lease in the city's history. The developers built The Colonnade in conjunction with Britannica House at 151 Bloor, which sits on the same parcel. Shortly after the project got underway, Minden sold his half-stake to the Rubin Corporation, which became Revenue Properties later.\nGerald Robinson served as architect for the project, while Wells and Tampold were the associate architects. Norbert Seethaler was the structural engineer, John Garay Associates were the mechanical engineers, and Ellard Wilson Associates were the electrical engineers. Sasaki-Strong Associates served as landscape architects.\nMayor Donald Summerville opened The Colonnade on 16 October 1963. At the time of the opening, the building was incomplete. Construction continued until April 1964.\nThe forecourt facing Bloor Street\nRobinson drew inspiration from the concept that Le Corbusier used in his Unit\u00e9 d'habitation projects. The main block of the structure sits on a 20-foot column grid, and is 16 bays long and three bays wide. The first three storeys form the base of the structure and terminate in arches below the fourth floor. An article in The Canadian Architect compared Robinson's treatment of the arches to those of a Gothic cathedral. On either side, a two-storey podium that is two bays deep extends from the main block. Both sides of the podium include semi-elliptical cutaways that form forecourts. In the front forecourt, a floating staircase leads to a terrace on the second floor deck.\nBelow ground there are two levels of parking. The three-storey base has shops at street level and on the second floor, while the third floor serves as a mechanical area. Originally, the second floor included a 190-seat theatre called the Colonnade Theatre. Previously, Burns had served as producer for the Arts Theatre Club. The first play to run at The Colonnade Theatre was Before Compiegne, which was written by Jack Winter and opened on 3 April 1964. The play was directed by George Luscombe of Toronto Workshop Productions.\nThe fourth and fifth floors of the main block were offices originally. Floors 6-13 are apartments, and two of the 13th floor units extend to the 14th floor penthouse. Both penthouse units include open terraces, one of which has a pool. When it opened, the 164 apartments ranged in price from $110 to $1,400 per month. Over the years, The Colonnade's residents included performers Jan Rube\u0161 and Susan Douglas Rube\u0161, Simpsons chairman G. Allan Burton, lawyer Ronald Rolls, professor Thomas Howarth, judge Hugh Foster, member of parliament Marvin Gelber, and literary agent Beverley Slopen.\nRobinson believed The Colonnade should have served as a template for new downtown developments. He said, \"the whole city should be like this.  The principles we have used here will be needed in any downtown development if it is not to be dehumanized. Do you want something like Place Ville Marie where the great towers stand empty at night and the shops are below ground?\"\nThe Globe and Mail's architecture critic, Adele Freedman, wrote later",
    "2022 studio album by OGJB Quartet\nOde to O is the second album by the OGJB Quartet, a collaborative ensemble named after the first letters of the musicians' first names, featuring saxophonist Oliver Lake, cornetist Graham Haynes, double bassist Joe Fonda, and drummer Barry Altschul. Named after the title track, a tribute to Ornette Coleman, it was recorded on June 7 and 8, 2019, at Sear Sound Studios in New York City, and was released in 2022 by TUM Records.\nReception\nIn a review for All About Jazz, John Sharpe wrote: \"one of the most striking traits is how much they sound like a band... This is an outfit which merits a longer run than it may get given the difficulty of getting the four principals together.\"\nWill Layman of PopMatters stated: \"If 'vintage' sometimes means seeming old-fashioned or left behind, then these gentlemen demonstrate that fresh thinking is possible at any age. They play here with an exquisite connection to each other and to music history.\"\nWriting for Burning Ambulance, Phil Freeman commented: \"The mere fact that there's a second album by this group makes me happy. They've got a unique sound, based entirely on the interplay between the four members' personalities... there's a significant distance between what each of them does in other contexts. So listening to them cross those spaces to find somewhere to meet is what makes this music interesting.\"\nThe Big Takeover's Michael Toland remarked: \"These veteran heavy hitters bring all of their talents to bear on Ode to O... It would be extremely difficult for these players to create bad music in the first place, but it's clear on Ode to O the extra inspiration they take from each other's presence.\"\nIn an article for The Quietus, Peter Margasak noted that the musicians have found \"a bracing freebop sweet spot together,\" and wrote: \"there's an abiding equanimity to the proceedings, imbuing the performances with grace regardless of how fiery things might get... The themes are elegant and memorable, elastic enough to support some fiery blowing and rhythmic dissection.\"\nDaniel Spicer of Jazzwise praised the title track, calling it \"a deceptively conventional hard-bop swinger with a big-grinned joie de vivre,\" as well as \"Da Bang\" (dedicated to Billy Bang), which \"bursts out of an extended solo drum intro with an irresistible bass vamp heavy enough to establish its own gravitational field. Serious fun.\"\nThe New York City Jazz Record's George Kanzler also singled out the title track, on which Altschul and Fonda \"mesh, expanding and contracting rhythms like images in a kaleidoscope, Lake and Haynes trading and jamming lines, cornet floating long notes, alto bobbing and weaving, pinching a note, arpeggiating a string of them.\"\nA writer for Glide Magazine stated: \"OGJB take in both a wide swath of sound and emotion as they journey into startling, ever-unpredictable territory.... the spirit of Coleman's free expression prevails throughout, as if to form a more contemporary but less direct version of the acclaimed quartet Old and New Dreams... who directly channeled Coleman's music.\"\nGary Chapin of The Free Jazz Collective commented: \"I'm not going to call it effortless, but there's an ease to the group that comes from their decades of experience and the naturalness of their musical relationships. To me, OGJB represents a great time in the past, and a great time in the present.\"\nJon Garelick of The Arts Fuse selected the album as one of the ten best jazz releases of 2022.\nTrack listing\n\"Ode to O\" (Barry Altschul) \u2013 6:52\n\"Justice\" (Oliver Lake) \u2013 5:22\n\"Me without Bela\" (Joe Fonda) \u2013 12:24\n\"Da Bang\" (Barry Altschul) \u2013 9:06\n\"The Other Side\" (Graham Haynes) \u2013 6:55\n\"Caring\" (Barry Altschul) \u2013 4:56\n\"OGJB #3\" (Barry Altschul / Joe Fonda / Graham Haynes / Oliver Lake) \u2013 3:53\n\"Bass Bottom\" (Oliver Lake) \u2013 2:37\n\"OGJB #4\" (Barry Altschul / Joe Fonda / Graham Haynes / Oliver Lake) \u2013 5:10\n\"Apaixonado\" (Graham Haynes) \u2013 5:10\nPersonnel\nOliver Lake \u2013 alto saxophone\nGraham Haynes \u2013 cornet, electronics\nJoe Fonda \u2013 double bass\nBarry Altschul \u2013 drums, percussion\n",
    "English major in the Royal Marines\nThomas Oldfield (21 June 1756 \u2013 1799) was an English major in the Royal Marines.\nBiography\nOldfield was the third son of Humphrey Oldfield, an officer in her majesty's marine forces. He was born at Stone, Staffordshire, on 21 June 1756. His mother was a daughter of Major-general Nicholls, of the Honourable East India Company's service. His father died in America shortly after the affair of Bunker's Hill. Oldfied accompanied his father to America in the autumn of 1774, or in the following spring. He served as a volunteer with the marine battalion at Bunker's Hill on 17 June 1775. In this action he was twice wounded, and his wrist was permanently injured. After the action Oldfield accepted a commission in a provincial corps -it is believed Tarleton's legion. In 1775 he took up a commission in the royal marines which was intended for his brother, although it was by an error made out in his name.\nOldfield, who did not join the marines until the close of the American war, served with the 83rd regiment at the siege of Charleston, South Carolinia, in 1780. He was promoted to a first lieutenancy in the royal marines on 16 April 1778, and, being distinguished by his intelligence and gallantry, was placed on the stall of the quartermaster-general's department. As deputy assistant-quartermaster-general he was attached to the headquarters of the Marquis (then Lord) Cornwallis and to lord Rawdon (afterwards Marquis of Hastings). He was constantly engaged under their immediate eye, and the repeatedly bore testimony to his zeal, gallantry, and ability. Oldfield was taken prisoner with Lord Cornwallis at the capitulation of Yorktown.\nAt the termination of the war Oldfield went to England, and was quartered at Portsmouth, when he purchased a small place in the parish of Westbourne. He named it Oldfield Lawn. In 1788 Oldfield went to the West Indies, returning in very bad health. In 1798 he was promoted captain, and again went to the West Indies in the Sceptre, 64 guns, Captain Dacres. In 1794 Oldfield commanded the royal marines landed from the squadron to co-operate with the army in the island of St. Domingo. Oldfield distinguished himself on every occasion that offered. In storming one of the enemy's works at Cape Nicholas mole, he was the first to enter it, and with his own hand struck the enemy's colours, which are now in possession of the family. He returned to England in the autumn of 1795 in precarious health.\nIn 1796 Oldfield was employed on the recruiting service at Manchester and Warrington. The following year he embarked on board the Theseus, 74 guns, and sailed to join the squadron under the orders of the Earl of Saincent of Cadiz. Upon the Theseus reaching her destination, she became the flagship of Horatio Nelson, then a rear-admiral. Oldfield was engaged in two bombardments of Cadiz in June 1797, in one of which he was wounded while in the host with the admiral.\nImmediately after the second bombardment he sailed in the Theseus, accompanied by a small squadron, for Teneriffe. In the pliant but unsuccessful attempt upon this island Oldfield commanded the force of royal marines which effected a landing from the squadron. His boat was swamped, but he swam to shore, and on landing received a contusion in the right knee. He materially contributed to the saving of the British detachment, whose temerity in attacking with so inferior a force was only equalled by the gallantry with which they carried the attack into execution. Its failure may be attributed to the loss of the cutter Fox, 10 guns, which was sunk by the enemy's fire, with a considerable part of the force destined for the enterprise. It was in this affair that Nelson lost his arm. In a private letter, written after the battle of the Nile, Oldfield said that \"it was by no means so severe as the affair at Teneriffe, or the second night of the bombardment of Cadiz.\"\nUntil the Theseus was detached to join Nelson (who had shifted his flag to the Vanguard, and gone in pursuit of the French squadron up the Mediterranean), Oldfield remaining with the fleet under the orders of the Earl of St. Vincent. At the battle of the Nile Oldfield was the senior officer of royal marines in the fleet, and obtained the rank of major for his services, his commission dating 7 October 1798. Oldfield relates in a private letter how, after the disappointment of not finding the French fleet at Alexandria, the Zealous made the signal at midday on 1 August that it was in the bay of Aboukir. At half-past three the French fleet was plainly seen, and an hour afterwards Nelson bade the Theseus go ahead of him. Oldfield in the Theseus was alongside the Guerrier at a quarter to seven o'clock, and having poured in a broadside which carried away her mainmast and mizzenmast, he passed on to the Sparticle and anchored abreast of her, the admiral anchoring on the other side ten minutes later. After the action Oldfield was sent with his marines on board the Tonnan",

    "Fountain by Niels Skovgaard\nThe Hippocampus Well (Danish: Havhestebr\u00f8nden) is a fountain by Niels Skovgaard, carved in stone in the shape of a Hippocampus. Originally installed on Kultorvet in Copenhagen, it has now been moved to the central courtyard of the Danish Design Museum on Bredgade. A plaster model  is on display in Vejen Art Museum.\nHistory\nThe fountain photographed by Holger Damgaard on Kultorvet in 1923.\nThe fountain was created as Niels Skovgaard's submission to a competition for a new fountain on Vesterbros Torv in Copenhagen. Elijah's Church was inaugurated on the square in April  1906. At its meeting on 20 May 1908, Foreningen til Hovedstadens Forsk\u00f8nnelse decided to launch a competition for the design of a fountain for the \"new square\". The three other artists who were invited to participate in the competition were Rasmus Harboe, Hans Tegner and J. F. Willumsen. The deadline for submissions of their proposals were already in July the same year. Hans Tegner did not submit a proposal. Willumsens proposal was believed to require too much water. The board of the association did not have a clear favourite between Skovgaard's and Harboe's proposals. It was initially decided to install 1;1 models of both works on the square but Skovgaard was unable to meet the deadline and Harboe's proposal was therefore selected as the winner.\nThe architect Hans Henrik Koch had been strongly in favour of Skovgaard's proposal. In November 1910, at a board meeting in Fonden til Kunstneriske Formaals Fremme, he proposed that it should be installed in another location. It was ultimately decided to install it on Kultorvet. It was unveiled in August 1916. The greenish stone from Norway soon turned out to be badly affected by the weather. In 1923 the fountain was therefore moved to a more protected location in the courtyard of the Danish Museum of Arts & Crafts.\n\nOther versions\nDetail of one of the plaster models in Vejen Art Museum.\nA plaster model from 1908 was acquired by the Ny Carlsberg Foundation in 1943. It is in the collection of Sor\u00f8 Art Museum.\nA 1:1 plaster model was put on storage in  Christiansborg Palace. In 1996, the severely damaged model was transferred to Vejen Art Museum. It was subsequently restored and is now on display in the museum's Skibbelund Hall. Om April 2004, Bejen Kunstmuseum bought another plaster model of the work (19.2 \u00d7 18.8 \u00d7 28.2\u00a0cm) at auction. A stoneware version is located in a private garden.\n",
    "British colonel in the Royal Engineers and the director-general of telegraphs in India\nDaniel George Robinson (8 March 1826 \u2013 27 July 1877) was a British colonel in the Royal Engineers and the director-general of telegraphs in India.\nBiography\nRobinson was born 8 March 1826, and entered the military college of the East India Company at Addiscombe in 1841. He was appointed a second lieutenant in the Bengal engineers on 9 June 1843, and, after going through the usual course of instruction at Chatham, embarked for India in 1845. He arrived in time to join Sir Hugh Gough's army and take part in the Sutlaj campaign. He was engaged in the battle of Sobraon, and received the war medal. He was promoted first lieutenant on 16 June 1847. In 1848 and 1849 Robinson served in the Panjab campaign, and took part in the battles of Chillianwallah, 13 January 1849, and Gujer\u00e1t, 21 February 1849, again receiving the war medal. In 1850 he was appointed to the Indian survey, upon which he achieved a great reputation for the beauty and exactitude of his maps. His maps of the Rawal Pindi and of the Gwalior country may be specially mentioned. He received the thanks of the government for his book, and the surveyor-general of India observed: \u2018I have no hesitation in saying that these maps will stand in the first rank of topographical achievements in India, and I can conceive nothing superior to them executed in any country.\u2019 On 21 November 1856 Robinson was promoted captain, and on 31 Deember 1862 lieutenant-colonel.\nIn 1865 Robinson was appointed director-general of Indian telegraphs. He entered on his duties at a critical time in the development of telegraphs. During the twelve years he was at the head of the department, the telegraphs, from a small beginning, spread over India, and were connected by overland and submarine lines with England. His zeal and activity, joined to great capacity for administration and organisation, enabled him to place the Indian telegraph department on a thoroughly efficient footing, and the lines erected were executed in the most solid manner. He took a leading part in the deliberations of the commission at Berne in 1871, and of the international conferences at Rome and St. Petersburg, on telegraphic communication. He was promoted to be brevet-colonel on 31 December 1867, and regimental colonel on 1 April 1874. He died on his way home from India on board the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Travancore, at sea, on 27 July 1877.\n",
    "British colonel in the Royal Engineers\nJohn Thomas Smith FRS (16 April 1805 \u2013 14 May 1882) was a British colonel in the Royal Engineers.\nBiography\nSmith was the second son of George Smith of Edwalton, Nottinghamshire, and afterwards of Fo\u00eblallt, Cardiganshire, by his wife Eliza Margaret, daughter of Welham Davis, elder brother of the Trinity House. He was born at Fo\u00eblallt on 16 April 1805. He was educated at Repton and at the high school, Edinburgh, entered the military college of the East India Company at Addiscombe in 1822, and received a commission as second lieutenant in the Madras engineers on 17 June 1824. He was promoted to be first lieutenant on the following day, and went to Chatham for a course of instruction in professional subjects. Smith left Chatham on 4 February 1825, and arrived at Madras on 2 September of the same year.\nOn 28 April 1826 Smith was appointed acting superintending engineer in the public works department for the northern division of the presidency, and on 2 May 1828 he was confirmed in the appointment. He thereupon began a series of investigations in reference to lighthouse-lanterns, devising a reciprocating light. Smith suggested to government the improvement of the lighthouse at Hope's Island, off Coringa, and at the end of 1833 his services were placed at the disposal of the marine board, with a view to the improvement of the lighthouse at Madras. On 11 February 1834 ill-health compelled Smith to sail for England on leave of absence. Before his departure the governor in council informed him in very complimentary terms that the marine board had adopted his plans for remodelling the lighthouses both at Madras and at Hope's Island. He was promoted to be captain on 5 March 1835.\nSmith remained in England until 28 July 1837, and in the same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was given an extension of furlough to superintend the manufacture of apparatus for the Madras lighthouse. He employed his leisure in the translation of J. L. Vicat's valuable treatise on mortars and cements, to which he added the results of many original experiments, and saw the work through the press before leaving for India. It appeared as \u2018A Practical and Scientific Treatise on Calcareous Mortars and Cements, Artificial and Natural, with Additions,\u2019 8vo, London, 1837. On his return to Madras on 13 December 1837 he was appointed to the command of the Madras sappers and miners, but remained at Madras on special duty. On 20 March 1838 he was appointed to the first division of the public works department, comprising the districts of Ganjam, Rajamandry, and Vizagapatam, and on 24 April he took charge of the office of the chief engineer. He served on a committee to inspect and report upon the state of the Red-hill railroad and canal, and he surveyed the Ennore and Pulicat lakes, to ascertain the practicability and cost of keeping open the bar of the Kuam river by artificially closing that of the Ennore river; thereby the whole of the waters collected in the Pulicat lake would be turned into the Kuam, a measure which he considered would afford peculiar facilities for cleansing the Black Town, besides improving the water communication between Madras and Sulurpet. Meanwhile, he superintended the erection of the Madras lighthouse, which was begun in 1838 and completed in 1839. On 5 April 1839 Smith was appointed to the sixth division of the public works department, and on 7 May to officiate as superintending engineer at Madras.\nOn 24 September 1839 Smith was relieved from all other duties to enable him to inspect and report upon the machinery of the mint at Madras. On 7 February 1840, the date of the re-establishment of the mint, Smith was appointed mint-master, and by a thorough reformation of the whole establishment soon brought the mint into a high state of efficiency. The satisfactory results obtained by Smith's skilful adaptation to steam power of the old and simple mint machinery driven by animal power were referred to in a financial despatch of 16 March 1841 to the court of directors as highly creditable. On 13 January 1846 he visited the Cape of Good Hope on leave of absence, returning to the mint on 28 December 1847. An innovation which Smith introduced of adjusting the weights of the blanks by means of the diameters of the pieces, instead of by their thickness, resulted in his design of a very ingenious and beautiful machine, by which twenty or a hundred blanks could be weighed to half a grain and deposited in a separate cell by a single person with two motions of the hand. After the pieces had been thus sorted they were passed through a set of circular cutters, which removed a certain weight according to the excess of each over the standard. By this means almost the whole of the blanks were obtained of the exact weight without further correction. This machine gained an award at the London International Exhibition of 1851.\nSmith was promoted to be major on 2 March 1852, and lieutenant-co",

He graduated from the Moscow Military School of Civil Defense (1970), the Military Academy of Logistics and Transport (1977) (both absorbed into the Military Logistics Academy), and the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia (1988).\nHe served in the USSR Civil Defense Forces, commanded a reconnaissance platoon of a separate mechanized battalion, and in 1971-1975 was a company commander in the Leningrad Military District. After graduating from the academy, he continued to serve in the Logistics Units of the Soviet Armed Forces: from 1977 he served as Deputy Commander of the 153rd Tank Regiment for Logistics in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, from 1980 he served as Deputy Chief of Logistics Staff and head of the Logistics Control Center of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army. Since 1982 he was deputy division commander for logistics and chief of logistics of a motorized rifle division in the Siberian Military District (Omsk).\nFrom 1992 he served as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Western Group of Forces for Logistics - Chief of Logistics of the Western Group of Forces.

    "Extinct genus of skunk\nMartinogale is an extinct genus of skunk from the Late Miocene of central North America. There exist three accepted species, M. alveodens, M.chisoensis and M. faulli, which may have overlapped in range but occupied somewhat distinct moments of the Late Miocene.As well as the dubious Martinogale? nambiana.\nDescription and species\nMartinogale, as happens with most fossil skunks, has been solely described off of fragmentary craneal remains. The genus is mainly characterized by its jaws: in the upper jaw there's an absent upper Molar\n2\n{\\displaystyle ^{2}}\n, and greatly enlarged but thin upper Premolar\n4\n{\\displaystyle ^{4}}\n and Molar\n1\n{\\displaystyle ^{1}}\n; while the lower jaw has a small and forward P\n2\n{\\displaystyle ^{2}}\n, the absence of a lingual or labial cingulum around the P\n4\n{\\displaystyle ^{4}}\n and a well developed  M\n1\n{\\displaystyle ^{1}}\n; neither jaw has a present Premolar\n1\n{\\displaystyle ^{1}}\n. In regards to skull morphology, it is smoother and narrower than in living skunks, with a large, flask-shaped basicranial bulla.\nMartinogale alveodens\nThis species was described in 1930 as a small mustelid from a fragmentary lower jaw found in the Edson Quarry, from late Hemphillian Kansas. It was described as the type of the new genus. Due to its fragmentary nature, the placement of Martinogale within Mustelidae was uncertain, but seemed feasible due to some similarities to the earlier Martes nambianus. In 1938, a better preserved jaw indicated similarities with the spotted skunks of Mephitidae. The species name, alveodens, hails from Latin alveus, \u201ca hollow, cavity or channel\" and dens, \"tooth\"\nMartinogale chisoensis\nThe largest species, M. chisoensis hails from the early Hemphillian Crew Bean Local, it was described in 2003 based on a rather complete skull. Due to the cranial similarities with Buisnictis it was named \"Buisnictis\" chisoensis. In 2005, along with the description of M. faulli, it was reassigned to Martinogale. The species name, chisoensis, comes from Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park, Texas, and ensis, Latin for \u201cfrom\u201d.\nMartinogale faulli\nThe oldest and smallest of the species, M. faulli was described in 2005 from a partial skull found in the Late Clarendonian Dove Spring Formation, from Kern County, California. M. faulli has a smoother skull than M. chisoensis and relatively smaller teeth, with a better defined basicranial bulla. The species name faulli is in honor of Mark Faull, a former ranger at Red Rock Canyon State Park.\nMartinogale? nambiana\nIn 1874, a P\n3\n{\\displaystyle ^{3}}\n, P\n4\n{\\displaystyle ^{4}}\nand an incredibly fragmentary M\n1\n{\\displaystyle ^{1}}\nwere discovered in the Santa F\u00e9 Marls, New Mexico. Cope originally identified it as Martes nambianus, uncertain of this association, a year later Cope moved it to Mustela nambiana. When Hall erected Martinogale, he moved M. nambiana into his new genus, where it has since remained. In 2005, Wang et. al. argued that the few characteristics present in these teeth were too non-specific, arguing that they simply represent the basal mustelid condition and that M? nambiana should not be considered a part of Martinogale; that the specimen can't be ascribed to a concrete genus.\nPhylogeny\nWhen compared to modern genera, both extant: Spilogale, Mephitis and Conepatus, as well as extinct: Brachyprotoma and Osmotherium, Martinogale presents reasonable differences in the premolar structure, thin postorbital skull, slightly expanded mastoid process and the general structure of the  basicranial bulla. In 2005 Wang et al.'s phylogenetic analysis recovered Martinogale as a somewhat paraphyletic association, although as their chronology advances so does their derivation:\n",

Her second pamphlet, Shadow Dispatches (2013), won the Mslexia pamphlet prize, and was shortlisted for the 2014 Lakeland Book of the Year.\nIn 2018, Atkin was writer in residence at Gladstone's Library.\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she was awarded a Northern Writers Award for Poetry, and said of it \"This award not only offers creative encouragement when I really need it, but financial support which will make continuing to create possible. It has saved my year.\"\nAtkin's 2021 biography of Dorothy Wordsworth, Recovering Dorothy: The Hidden Life of Dorothy Wordsworth, draws on Dorothy's letters and unpublished diaries and \"argues for Dorothy's place in the writing of illness\". It was longlisted for the 2022 Barbellion Prize for books by ill or disabled writers.\nHer 2023 memoir Some of Us Just Fall was longlisted for the 2024 Lakeland Book of the Year. It has been described as \"a raw and exquisite meditation on chronic illness and our place within the landscape\", \"An empowered and patient story, at times murky and tedious, but still poignant\", and \"Essentially ... a book about bearing the unbearable\".\nShe is a founder and director of The Gravestone Project, \"a digital humanities collective that brings together scholars, taphophiles, students, writers, teachers, and others interested in history, literature, and the arts, to think about the various ways that people memorialize the dead\".\nShe was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2022.\nPersonal life\nAtkin has one of the  Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndromes and genetic haemochromatosis, and writes and talks about living with chronic illness especially in relation to rural life and access to nature.  She was a speaker at the 2023 Kendal Mountain Festival but published an open letter criticising the announcement that the festival's events would not be filmed that year, announced as an  \"enrichment\" at short notice, arguing that this deprived many people, because of disability, geography, finance or other barriers, of the joy of  access to the festival whose theme, that year, was \"joy\".\nAtkins lives in Grasmere, Cumbria.

    "Theorem in probability theory\nThe Yamada\u2013Watanabe theorem is a result from probability theory saying that for a large class of stochastic differential equations a weak solution with pathwise uniqueness implies a strong solution and uniqueness in distribution. In its original form, the theorem was stated for \nn\n{\\displaystyle n}\n-dimensional It\u00f4 equations and was proven by the Japanese mathematicians Toshio Yamada and Shinz\u014d Watanabe in 1971. Since then, many generalizations appeared particularly one for general semimartingales by Jean Jacod from 1980.\nYamada\u2013Watanabe theorem\nHistory, generalizations and related results\nJean Jacod generalized the result to SDEs of the form\nd\nX\nt\n=\nu\n(\nX\n,\nZ\n)\nd\nZ\nt\n,\n{\\displaystyle dX_{t}=u(X,Z)dZ_{t},}\nwhere \n(\nZ\nt\n)\nt\n\u2265\n0\n{\\displaystyle (Z_{t})_{t\\geq 0}}\n is a semimartingale and the coefficient \nu\n{\\displaystyle u}\n can depend on the path of \nZ\n{\\displaystyle Z}\n.\nFurther generalisations were done by Hans-J\u00fcrgen Engelbert (1991) and Thomas G. Kurtz (2007).

    "2021 soundtrack album by Billy Bang\nLucky Man: Music from the Film is the soundtrack to the 2010 film Lucky Man, directed by Jean-Marie Boulet and Markus Hansen, documenting violinist and Vietnam veteran Billy Bang's 2008 visit to the country, 40 years after his participation in the Vietnam War as a tunnel rat. The album consists of field recordings created during Bang's travels across Vietnam, during which he interacted with local musicians, and came to appreciate the country's culture while at the same time seeking closure for the trauma he experienced during the war. The recording was released in 2021 on vinyl, CD, and as a digital download by BBE Music in association with IF Music.\nReception\nIn a review for Jazzwise, Kevin Le Gendre wrote: \"Bang was nothing if not open-minded and his ability to blend a wide range of black music, from hard blues to open avant-garde, serve him well here in the company of skilled traditional players... This is deeply poignant music that offers invaluable catharsis to the horrors of war.\"\nKarl Ackermann of All About Jazz stated: \"The music is unlike anything else that Bang had recorded... Bang sometimes sounds like he has conquered his demons, but at other times, his pain is palpable... Bang's trademark acerbic but animated style is peppered with the violinist's inner dialog.\"\nWriting for Strings Magazine, Greg Cahill called Bang's playing \"poignant,\" and commented: \"The personal nature of these field recordings has a healing effect and sheds new light on Bang\u2019s own dogged pursuit of peace.\"\nJazz Journal's Matthew Wright described the music as \"wonderful,\" with Bang \"relating to and recognising the link between the Vietnamese style of playing and sound and his own.\" He praised the track titled \"Mystery of the Mekong,\" featuring Bang's violin \"soaring above a rich aggregation of strings, resonant cellos and almost rhapsodic support from the piano.\"\nIn an article for Truth and Lies, Justin Turford called the album \"an extraordinary soundtrack to an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man,\" with music that is \"unlike anything I've heard before.\" He singled out the track titled \"Dan Da,\" on which Bang's violin joins Duc Dau's dan da, a stone lithophone, describing it as \"the most perfect example of improvisational skill between two masters from different worlds,\" and noting: \"Their elation and excitement is palpable as they push and drive each other to new heights and is a privilege to behold.\"\nTrack listing\n\"Lucky Man: Introduction\" \u2013 4:10\n\"Billy playing with the Banhar Gong Group of Kuntum (traditional and improvised)\" \u2013 6:16\n\"Lucky Man: Flashback Tunnel Reflections\" \u2013 1:26\n\"Mystery of the Mekong\" \u2013 6:59\n\"Lucky Man: The Sun Rising - Introduction to Song for Don Cherry\" \u2013 1:03\n\"Song for Don Cherry\" \u2013 13:26\n\"Lucky Man: Flashback Memories\" \u2013 1:45\n\"New Saigon Phunk (Extended Version)\" \u2013 11:35\n\"Lucky Man: Traditional Vietnamese Catru Music\" \u2013 0:59\n\"Lucky Man: Billy Reflecting on Memories and Feelings\" \u2013 0:51\n\"Jungle Lullaby (Live at the Sax n'Art Club)\" \u2013 12:26\n\"Lucky Man: Quynh Anh Pham's Memories About Her Father\" \u2013 1:07\n\"Dan Da\" \u2013 9:45\n\"Lucky Man: Billy Speaking About Music and Art\" \u2013 0:47\n\"Lucky Man: Flashlight and a 45 Tunnel Memories\" \u2013 1:53\n\"Lucky Man Title Music: Vietnam 1967 Battle Composition\" \u2013 1:06\n\"Lucky Man: Teach Me Banhar\" \u2013 1:09\n\"Traditional Quan Ho\" \u2013 5:47\n\"Lucky Man: Billy Reflecting on America, Music and Being Left Alone\" \u2013 1:05\n\"Moments for the KIAMIA (Solo in a Hotel Interior Courtyard)\" \u2013 2:30\n\"Lucky Man: Quynh Anh Pham Lullaby\" \u2013 0:44\n\"New Saigon Phunk\" \u2013 5:51\nPersonnel\nBilly Bang \u2013 violin, voice\nBanhar Gong Group (track 2)\nHanoi Symphony Orchestra conducted by Tuan Phuong (track 4)\nDuc Dau \u2013 dan da (tracks 6, 8, 13, 22)\nPhu Dong Family Band (tracks 6, 8, 9, 22)\nTr\u1ea7n M\u1ea1nh Tu\u1ea5n \u2013 saxophone (track 11)\nQuynh Anh Pham \u2013 voice (track 12)\nCau River Singers  \u2013 vocals (track 18)\n",

For the concert tour, see The Chromatica Ball.\nGaga Chromatica Ball is an upcoming television special directed and produced by the singer-songwriter Lady Gaga. The television special documents the Chromatica Ball for Gaga's sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020), at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California. The concert special is set to be released on May 25, 2024, through HBO and its streaming service, Max.\nProduction\nSee also: The Chromatica Ball \u00a7\u00a0Background and development\nThe Chromatica Ball initially began as a limited concert series lasting for six days in the summer of that year, in support of Lady Gaga's sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020). Due to the uprising concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, the limited concert tour was postponed until the summer of next year, which again was postponed to 2022.\nNew dates for Gaga's seventh headlining concert tour were scheduled and officially announced in March 2022 and began in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. The concert tour lasted for three months and concluded on September 17 at Miami Gardens, Florida. Each show spans approximately two hours and is divided into a prelude, four acts, and a finale, and each one is accompanied by an interlude directed by the artist's longtime collaborator Nick Knight. The tour was a commercial success and received critical acclaim.\nGaga commissioned an unknown project recording for a sold-out performance of the Chromatica Ball, in September 2022, located at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California. The artist later confirmed through her social media accounts in June 2023, the upcoming project is for a concert film.

    "Municipal building in Grays, Essex, England\nThurrock Town Hall is a newest part of municipal complex in New Road in Grays, Essex, a town in England. The complex accommodates the offices and meeting place of Thurrock Council.\nHistory\nThe 1992 extension (left) and 1986 building (right)\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with chemical manufacturing, a local board of health was established in Grays in 1886. The board was succeeded by Grays Thurrock Urban District Council in 1894, and council offices were established at No. 53 High Street. After the urban districts of Grays Thurrock, Purfleet and Tilbury, as well as the Orsett Rural District were amalgamated to form Thurrock Urban District Council in 1936, the enlarged council established its offices in a house, previously known as \"Farley\", in Whitehall Lane in Grays. This remained the meeting place for Thurrock Council after it was formed in 1974.\nHowever, in the early 1980s, in the context of the increased responsibilities of local authorities, council leaders decided that they needed more substantial facilities. The oldest part of the new complex was the eastern section, on the corner with Derby Road. It was designed in the modern style, built in red brick and opened as Thurrock Council Offices in 1986. This building later became known as Council Offices Building 1 ('CO1'). The design of the three-storey building involved an asymmetrical main frontage of 11 bays facing onto New Road. The eighth bay contained a full-height plate-glass wall, which was projected forward and surmounted by a semi-circular stone clad roof. The upper floors were slightly canted forward and fenestrated by a series of tall bi-partite and tri-partite casement windows. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber, the committee rooms and the offices themselves.\nThe complex was extended to the west in a similar style in 1992. This building later became known as Council Offices Building 2 ('CO2'). Again, the first and second floors were slightly canted forward and fenestrated by a series of tall tri-partite casement windows. However, there was an additional floor which was fully clad in plate glass. Internally, the new block including a reception area and additional offices.\nIn October 2019, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, visited the council offices to sign a book of condolence commemorating 39 Vietnamese people who had died in the trailer of a refrigerator lorry.\nBy the 2020s, the offices needed refurbishment.  The council decided to vacate the 1986 building, to refurbish the 1992 extension, and to erect an additional block even further to the west on the corner of the New Road and the High Street, facing St Peter & St Paul's Church. The site was occupied by four shops which were demolished. The new block was designed by LSI Architects, built in buff brick at a cost of \u00a310 million and was completed in 2022. This building was known during the development phase as Council Offices Building 3 ('CO3'). The design of the new block involved an asymmetrical main frontage in two sections facing onto the High Street. Both sections were jettied out over the pavement with the left-hand section supported by piers. Internally, it incorporated a new reception area, committee rooms, a council chamber, a registry office, a cafe, and new offices.\nFollowing its completion, the council voted to rename new building \"Thurrock Town Hall\". The vacated 1986 building was marketed for sale on August 2023. The council indicated that it was suitable for conversion, or for redevelopment to allow new housing to be erected on that site.\n",

    "The probability of superiority or common language effect size is the probability that, when sampling a pair of observations from two groups, the observation from the second group will be larger than the sample from the first group. It is used to describe a difference between two groups. D. Wolfe and R. Hogg introduced the concept in 1971. Kenneth McGraw and S. P. Wong returned to the concept  in 1992 preferring the term common language effect size. The term probability of superiority was proposed by R. J. Grissom a couple of years later.\nThe probability of superiority can be formalized as \nP\n(\nX\n>\nY\n)\n{\\displaystyle P(X>Y)}\n. (D. Wolfe and R. Hogg originally discussed it in the inverted form \nP\n(\nX\n<\nY\n)\n{\\displaystyle P(X<Y)}\n). \nP\n(\nX\n>\nY\n)\n{\\displaystyle P(X>Y)}\n is the probability that some value (\nX\n{\\displaystyle X}\n) sampled at random from one population is larger than the corresponding score (\nY\n{\\displaystyle Y}\n) sampled from another population.\nExamples\nMcGraw and Wong gave the example of sex differences in height, noting that when comparing a random man with a random woman, the probability that the man will be taller is 92%. (Alternatively, in 92 out of 100 blind dates, the male will be taller than the female.)\nThe population value for the common language effect size is often reported like this, in terms of pairs randomly chosen from the population. Kerby (2014) notes that a pair, defined as a score in one group paired with a score in another group, is a core concept of the common language effect size.\nAs another example, consider a scientific study (maybe of a treatment for some chronic disease, such as arthritis) with ten people in the treatment group and ten people in a control group. If everyone in the treatment group is compared to everyone in the control group, then there are (10\u00d710=) 100 pairs. At the end of the study, the outcome is rated into a score, for each individual (for example on a scale of mobility and pain, in the case of an arthritis study), and then all the scores are compared between the pairs. The result, as the percent of pairs that support the hypothesis, is the common language effect size. In the example study it could be (let's say) .80, if 80 out of the 100 comparison pairs show a better outcome for the treatment group than the control group, and the report may read as follows: \"When a patient in the treatment group was compared to a patient in the control group, in 80 of 100 pairs the treated patient showed a better treatment outcome.\" The sample value, in for example a study like this, is an unbiased estimator of the population value.\nEquivalent statistics\nMain article: Mann\u2013Whitney U test \u00a7\u00a0Rank-biserial correlation\nAn effect size related to the common language effect size is the rank-biserial correlation.  This measure was introduced by Cureton as an effect size for the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. That is, there are two groups, and scores for the groups have been converted to ranks.\nThe Kerby simple difference formula computes the rank-biserial correlation from the common language effect size. Letting f be the proportion of pairs favorable to the hypothesis (the common language effect size), and letting u be the proportion of pairs not favorable, the rank-biserial r is the simple difference between the two proportions:\u00a0r\u00a0=\u00a0f\u00a0\u2212\u00a0u.  In other words, the correlation is the difference between the common language effect size and its complement.  For example, if the common language effect size is 60%, then the rank-biserial r equals 60% minus 40%, or\u00a0r\u00a0=\u00a00.20. The Kerby formula is directional, with positive values indicating that the results support the hypothesis.\nA non-directional formula for the rank-biserial correlation was provided by Wendt, such that the correlation is always positive.\nSee also\nPairwise comparisons\nCondorcet winner criterion\nIntransitive dice\n",

    "The statue.\nThe Statue of N. F. S, Grundtvig, situated in the central courtyard of Vartorv, close to the City Hall Square in central Copenhagen, Denmark, was created by Niels Skovgaard. It depicts N. F. S. Grundtvig knealing by the Spring of Life.\nDescription\nGrundtvig is depicted knealing by the Spring of Life. Skovgaard has signed the sculpture with his monigram (NKS) and the inscription Grundtvig og Livskilden (Grundtvig and the Spring of Life)  on the sole of his back-facing left shoe.\nNiels Skovgaard based his portrail of Grundtvig on his father P. C. Skovgaatrd's 1948 portrait drawing of Grundtvig. It is believed that P. X. Skovgaard's drawing was inspired by a three years older drawing by Gertner.\nHistory\nBackground\nNiels Skovgaard was the son of P. C. Skovgaard and Georgia Skovgaard. Grundtvig was a close friend of the family. He conducted the ceremony at the parents' wedding and their children Niels, Joakim and Suzette were also baptized by him. Niels Skovgaard and his brother Joakim were also good friends of Grundtvig's two sons. Throughout his career, Skovgaard received numerous commissions from independent Grundtvigian congregations and folk high Schools.\nGrundtvig died in 1872. A statue of him by Vilhelm Bissen was installed at the Frederick's Church construction site in 1894. In 1904, Rasmus B\u00f8gebjerg proposed another Grundtvig statue. His proposal depicted Grundtvig with a lark sitting on his left hand. The proposal was subject to a prolonged debate.\nThe teo competitions\nSkovgaard drawing from 1919.\nIn 1912, a competition for a Grundtvig monument was launched. Skovgaard's proposal received an award but none of the 32 submissions were selected as the final winner. Skovgaard was around the same time working on a portrait relief of Grundtvig for the Grundtvig House on Studiestr\u00e6de. A new invited competition was launched in 1913. The new competition was won by Niels Hansen Jacobsen. Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint awarded second prioze. It was later decided by the jury to go with Jensen-Klint's proposal. He had proposed a bell tower. It was later expaneed into the monumental Grundtvig's Church (1921\u20131940).\nCreating the sculpture\nThe completed statue at Lyngby Sugar Factory.\nSkovgaard kept working on his 1912 proposl. In 1925 he was finally commissioned by the Nt Carlsberg Foundation to create a granite version of the sculpture for Vartov's courtyard. It was executed with fewer details than the original proposal. It was unveiled at Vartov in 1932.\nPreliminary works\nTwo preliminary models of the work are in the collection of the National Gallery of Denmark.\nStatuette of magnesite, cm (h) x c, (w) x 35 cm (d), acuired in 1919\nStatuette of plaster, acquired in 1925\nStatuette of magnesite, acquired by the National Gallery of Denmark in 1919.\nPainted plaster model, acquired by the National Gallery of Denmark in 1925.\n",
    "Former royal palace in Hannover and main building of the Leibniz University Hanover\nThe Welfenschloss in Hanover\nThe Welfenschloss with the surrounding Welfengarten from the air\nThe Welfenschloss (English: Guelph palace) is a former royal palace in Hanover, Germany, which serves as the main building of the Leibniz University Hannover. The university is housed in the palace since 1879. The palace is surrounded by a large English landscape garden, named the Welfengarten (English: Guelph garden).\nHistory\nKing George V\nSchloss Monbrillant in 1850, which previously occupied the site\nA new royal residence\nIn 1856, king George V of Hanover (1819\u20131878) decided to build a new royal residence. Initially, only as a summer residence, but later intended as the main seat replacing the Leineschloss in the city center. The king engaged the architect Christian Heinrich Tramm (1819\u20131861) to make the designs in neo-Gothic style. When Tramm passed away, he was replaced by the construction manager of the project, Eduard Heidelberg.\nThe site of the palace of previously occupied by another palace, Schloss Monbrilliant. This palace dated from the first half of the 18th century. It served as a summer residence of kings Ernest Augustus (1771\u20131851) and George V. Before the building started of the new palace, it was demolished. It was rebuilt in Georgsmarienh\u00fctte, before it finally was teared down in 1923.\nConstruction of the Welfenschloss palace started in 1857. Workers used yellowish-white sandstone from the Danndorf and Velpke areas near Helmstedt, one of the hardest sandstones in Germany, and sandstone from Nesselberg near Nesselberg.\nThe bronze lions guarding the entrance\nThe palace was initially named Schloss K\u00f6nigsitz, but in 1861 this was changed into Welfenschloss after the reigning dynasty, the House of Welf, of which the House of Hanover was the surviving branch. This also determined the iconography of the palace. On the side of the garden, the Welfengarten, the exterior is decorated with sculptures of eight significant Welf rulers. The sculptor Wilhelm Engelhard created around 1862 the most important one, that of Henry the Lion (1129/1131-1195). On the entrance side, Adolf Rosenthal created the bronze Lions.\nPlan of the first floor before the rebuilding to University\nGeorge V's reign ended as a result of the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, after which Prussia annexed Hanover. Construction works ended, leaving the Welfenschloss palace empty for over a decade.\nIn the same time as the Welfenschloss was built, king George V also constructed another neo-gothic castle between 1858 and 1867, Marienburg castle. This he presented as a birthday present to his wife, queen Marie (1818\u20131907).\nA new purpose: the University of Hanover\nThe Welfenschloss around 1895\nMap of the palace and the surrounding Welfengarten in 1918\nIt was not until 1879, that a new purpose was found for the palace: the Higher Vocational School moved in, now named the University of Hanover. Extensive renovations works were performed by Hermann Hunaeus to transform the palace into a school building. In 1899, emperor Wilhelm II elevated the school the status of a university.\nDuring the Allied aerial raids on Hanover, the chapel on the east side of the palace was heavily damaged. In 1955, it was demolished. On its location, an extension was erected between 1956 and 1958 to house an auditorium and a lecture hall.\nIn 2006, the University of Hanover was renamed Leibniz University Hannover.\nSaxon Steed\nIn front of the palace, there is a bronze statue of a Saxon Steed (German: Sachsenross), created in 1866. It is a duplicate from a sculpture made by Albert Wolf for the entrance of the Altes Museum in Berlin, the L\u00f6wenk\u00e4mpfer. The Saxon Steed is a heraldic motif associated with the German provinces of Lower Saxony and Westphalia, and the Dutch region of Twente.\nPanorama\n The Welfenschloss today as the main building of the Leibniz University Hanover\n",
    "Historic building in North Yorkshire, England\nThe building, in 2012\nNutwith Cote is a historic building in Burton-on-Yore, a village in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThere was already a farm on the site in the 12th century, when Fountains Abbey acquired it from Richard de Hedune.  It served as a monastic grange until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when it was given to Richard Gresham.  In 1582, his descendant, William Gresham, sold the farm to Christopher Beckwith, and it remained in the Beckwith family for many generations.\nThe stables, in 2006\nThe oldest parts of the present house are the rear wings, dating from the early 17th century.  The main front was added in the late 18th century.  A grand stable was constructed in the early 18th century, and the farm became a noted centre for racehorse breeding, with the horse Bartlett's Childers being stabled there.  Of similar date is a coach house, which incorporates 16th-century beehives.  Further south are a mid-18th century barn and dovecote.  The house, stables, coach house and barn are all grade II* listed, while the dovecote is grade II listed.\nRear view of the house, showing the 17th century wing\nThe farmhouse is built of stone, with a moulded cornice, a coped parapet, and a stone slate roof with stone coping and shaped kneelers.  The main range dates from the 18th century, and has two storeys and a cellar, and four bays.  The central doorway has an architrave, a pulvinated frieze and a pediment, and above it is a sundial.  The windows on the front are sashes with plain surrounds and moulded sills.  To the right and lower is the 17th-century wing, which contains two windows, one with a chamfered surround and above one with a moulded architrave.\nThe coach house, in 2006\nThe stables are also built of stone, and have chamfered quoins and a corrugated asbestos roof.  There are two storeys and seven bays.  On the front are three doorways with chamfered quoined surrounds and tripartite keystones.  The windows are casements with projecting plain stone surrounds and tripartite keystones.\nThe coach house, is similarly built of stone, with quoins, an eaves band, and a stone roof with stone coping.  It is a small building, with a single storey and a single bay.  It contains an arched entrance with rusticated voussoirs and a keystone.  Above, in the gable, is an arched opening with a keystone.  To the right is a range of six 16th-century arched bee hives with moulded surrounds and semicircular apses.\nThe dovecote, in 2012\nThe stone barn has a stone slate roof with moulded kneelers and stone coping.  There is a single storey and three bays.  In the centre is an arched wagon entrance with moulded imposts, voussoirs and a keystone.  This is flanked by two giant Doric pilasters on plinths, carrying an entablature with a band, a frieze and a moulded cornice.  In each outer bay is a doorway with a square opening above.\nThe stone dovecote is now a ruin.  It has quoins and a coved cornice.  It contains a doorway with a lintel, and above it is a partially ruined oval window.\nSee also\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Burton-on-Yore\n",
    "\n2023 studio album by The Necks\nTravel is a 2024 studio album by Australian jazz trio The Necks. It has received positive reviews by critics.\nReception\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Travel received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 from 5 critic scores. Editors at AllMusic rated this album 4.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Thom Jurek writing that the music is \"impeccably recorded and mixed by longtime collaborator Tim Whitten\" and the album \"blossoms with new ideas, fluid spontaneity, and fresh ideas\", with a recommendation to new listeners to start here in the band's discography. The site also included this on their list of the best jazz albums of 2023. Online retailer Bandcamp included this among the best jazz albums of the year, with critic Dave Sumner writing that it \"captures a facet of  growth by recording extended sections of studio improvisations that mark the start of each day, a glimpse into the process that has led to so many of past albums\". In The Big Takeover, Michael Toland summed up his review, \"every song on Travel is intriguing and compelling, as this band\u2019s music always is, and it\u2019s heartening to see that putting the tunes in bite-sized nuggets (even if the bites are Tyrannosaurus-sized) doesn\u2019t make it any less so\". Kevin Whitlock of Jazzwise gave this album 5 out of 5 stars, calling this the band's best since Unfold in 2017 and \"each track constitues a musical journey\" with an uncertain endpoint. A short review in The New Yorker by Michaelangelo Matos praised the musicianship of the bandmembers and stated that this work \"showcases their singular style as effectively as any of their past work, with four songs of around twenty minutes apiece\". Richard Williams of Uncut rated Travel 4.5 out of 5 stars, noting elements of blues music and part of the band's multi-decade evolution.

    "\nThe Russian submarine Nerpa (Russian: \u041d\u0435\u0440\u043f\u0430, lit.\u2009'Baikal seal') was the second boat of the Morzh class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. It was laid down and launched on the same day in August 1913, and completed its sea trials in December 1914. Built for the Black Sea Fleet, the submarine saw action during World War I, and spent much of the war raiding Ottoman merchant shipping that transported coal from Zonguldak to Constantinople. Nerpa was credited with sinking 24 ships during the conflict for a total of 2,443\u00a0gross register tons\u00a0(GRT), making it the fourth most successful Russian submarine in the Black Sea.\nNerpa was undergoing major repairs at the shipyard in Nikolayev when the October Revolution occurred. During the Russian Civil War the city was occupied over time by several forces, including Germany, the Western Allies, and the White Army, before being taken by the Bolsheviks and becoming part of the Soviet Union. Nerpa was the only prewar Russian submarine in the Black Sea captured by the Bolsheviks, and it was commissioned into the Soviet Navy in June 1922, before being renamed Politruk (Russian: \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a, lit.\u2009'political leader') in January 1923. The boat became part of the Detached Submarine Division of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, along with four AG-class submarines. Politruk remained on active service until November 1929, when it was removed from the fleet, and it was scrapped in 1931.\nDesign and construction\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Morzh-class boats and three Narval class. The naval engineer Ivan Bubnov was the designer of the Morzh class and developed it from his earlier submarine Akula, which was considered to be the most advanced of the Russian submarines at the time. In the years before the 1911 program, there was debate in the Imperial Russian Navy on whether to purchase and build the submarines designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard, or a foreign inspired design, based on the popular Holland type, which became known as the Narval class. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class.\nThe Morzh-class submarines were well-armed for the time, having one deck gun, four internal torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars. However, the vessel had numerous shortcomings. It suffered from having only a single hull, lacking bulkheads, having a slow diving time of 3+1\u20442 minutes due to poor ballast tank venting, and a diving depth of only 25 fathoms (150\u00a0ft; 46\u00a0m). An additional problem was that twin 1,140 horsepower (850\u00a0kW) diesel engines to power all three Morzh-class boats had been ordered from Germany, but were not delivered by the time World War I broke out. They had to be replaced by severely underpowered engines from the Amur River gunboats, each of which delivered only 250 horsepower (190\u00a0kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30\u00a0km/h; 18\u00a0mph) surface speed could not be attained. The designed 12-knot (22\u00a0km/h; 14\u00a0mph) underwater speed also could not be attained due to a poorly designed hull shape, which was more like that of a surface vessel than a submarine. The construction of all three submarines began on 25 June 1911 and took place at the Nikolayev department of the Baltic Yard, which was created specifically to build the Morzh class. Some of the components were made in Saint Petersburg before being sent to Nikolayev to be assembled.\nNerpa was laid down and launched in August 1913, and received its engines in November 1914, with the sea trials taking place until the end of the following month. This made Nerpa the first of the Morzh-class boats to enter service, and at the time were they considered to be the best submarines in the Black Sea Fleet.\nWorld War I service\nNerpa during the war\nAt the same time when Nerpa was undergoing sea trials and began active service, the Russian Black Sea Fleet was following a defensive strategy, but this changed in early 1915 when the Stavka ordered it to attack the Bosporus to support the Gallipoli campaign of the British and the French. Nerpa carried out its first patrol near the Bosporus from 5 to 8 March 1915, becoming the first Russian submarine to do so. The patrol was uneventful. But by April, the Russian focus changed to stopping coal shipments along the Turkish coast from the area of Zonguldak t",
    "\n1993 unsolved deaths in Russia\nOn 5 August 1993, six Kazakhstani hikers died in the Khamar-Daban mountain range under uncertain circumstances. The event has been likened to the Dyatlov Pass incident, earning it the name \"Buryatia's Dyatlov Pass\".\nThe six hikers who died were members of a seven-person hiking group led by Lyudmila Korovina; Valentina Utochenko was the group's sole survivor. Although the police receiving a report, no formal search was carried out until 24 August. It took two days for helicopters to locate the remains, because Utochenko had not yet been able to recount her version of what had happened. According to an autopsy report, all of the victims died of hypothermia, except Korovina, who died from a heart attack.\nBackground\nKhamar-Daban, a mountain range in Southern Siberia, in the Republic of Buryatia, Russia, was a popular tourist hiking spot. In the summer of 1993, Lyudmila Korovina of the Petropavl \"Azimut\" tourist club, an experienced hiking instructor and a Master of Sports in hiking, planned a hiking trip to the Khamar-Daban mountains. She was joined by six of her students: Aleksander \"Sacha\" Krysin, Tatyana Filipenko, Denis Shvachkin, Valentina \"Valya\" Utochenko, Viktoriya Zalesova and Timur Bapanov. Korovina had previous experience hiking in the Khamar-Daban area, and the students trained with her for the trip.\nThe trip\nThe group of seven hikers, led by Korovina, arrived in Irkutsk by train in August 1993. Korovina's hiking group was one of three in the area, one of which was being led by her daughter, Natalia. Starting on 2 August 1993, their trip led from the village of Murino\u00a0, along the Langutai river, through the Langutai Gates pass, along the Barun-Yunkatsuk river, up the Khanulu mountain and along its ridge, ending on the watershed plateau of the Anigta and Baiga rivers. Korovina's group was meant to cross paths with her daughter's on 5 August.\nThe first two days of the hike turned out to have went better than the group had planned, with them making good time up Retranslyator peak, however, on 4 August, as they were beginning their descent, they were hit with an unexpected rainstorm. Korovina decided to make camp in an exposed location, with the group failing at an attempt to build a fire that night. They managed to build a fire in the morning of 5 August and ate breakfast together before continuing their path.\nThe deaths\nAccording to Valentina Utochenko, the sole survivor, while descending down the mountain, at the altitude of 2,396 metres (7,861\u00a0ft), Krysin, who was at the back of the group, started screaming. He was bleeding from his eyes and ears, frothing at the mouth. He fell to the ground convulsing and then went still. Korovina ran up to him, trying to get him to gain consciousness. A moment later, she cried out, having the same symptoms as Krysin. She convulsed and then collapsed on top of Krysin. Filipenko, who had gotten to Korovina first, was the next to collapse, grabbing at her throat as though she couldn't breath. She crawled over to a nearby rock and bashed her head against it until she went limp. Zalesova and Bapanov started to run. While running, they collapsed and died throwing up blood and clawing at their own throats, tearing their clothes off. Utochenko and Shvachkin hurried away, but shortly after Shvachkin also collapsed convulsing.\nUtochenko ran down the mountain, set up a tent for the night under tree cover and fell asleep. On the next day, she returned to the site of her friends' death to retrieve supplies she needed from their bodies. For four days, she followed power lines down the mountain in hopes that someone would find her. She found a river and started following it. On 9 August, she was found by a group of Ukrainian kayakers, who took her to the nearest police station where a report was filed.\nSearch and discovery\nUtochenko did not speak for several days. The official search was conducted on 24 August, led by Yuri Golius. Because Utochenko had not been able to recount her version of events yet, it took two days to find the bodies using helicopters. The hikers' bodies were noted to have been partially undressed.\nAll of the dead hikers were found to have signs of bruised lungs. An autopsy, carried out in Ulan-Ude, concluded that Krysin, Filipenko, Bapanov, Zalesova and Shvachkin died of hypothermia, and Korovina had a heart attack. Protein deficiency due to malnutrition was listed as a contributing factor to their deaths.\nTheories\nMultiple theories have been proposed to explain what caused the hikers' deaths. Rescuers Valery Tatarnikov and Vladimir Zinov, who took part in the search operation for the bodies, claimed that it was impossible for the hikers to die of cold. Zinov suggested that they might have died of altitude sickness. Tourist Vladimir Borzenkov and member of the search operation Nikolai Fedorov suggested that the hikers went mad due to infrasounds. Yuri Golius, the leader of the search operation, blamed their deaths on Korovin",
    "Church in Racib\u00f3rz, PolandCastle chapel in Racib\u00f3rz, Poland\nCastle courtyard and chapel \u2013 postcard from the 1920s\nChapel windows visible from inside the castle wing\nChapel windows visible from inside the castle wing\nPart of the interior\nAltarpiece of the chapel pending restoration work\nThe Castle Chapel of St. Thomas Becket (also known as, the Pearl of Silesian Gothic, or the Silesian Sainte-Chapelle) was built at the end of the 13th century and is located in the eastern wing of the castle in Racib\u00f3rz. Originally constructed in the Gothic style, the building incorporates elements of Baroque and Neo-Gothic architecture.\nFrom 1288 to 1416, a collegiate church was located next to the chapel, founded by the Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw, Tomasz II. The temple was repeatedly ravaged by fires, including those in 1519, 1637, and 1858. In 1988, during renovation works, the so-called Schneider's map was discovered, showing a handwritten depiction of a legendary tunnel leading under the Oder river. The chapel likely housed relics of Thomas Becket or St. Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w.\nHistory\nThe chapel was built in the 1280s (between 1288 and 1293) as a result of the construction of a new stone castle. It was likely erected on the site of a Romanesque rotunda, as indicated by archaeological excavations conducted in the 1960s and 1980s. The previous church was probably dedicated to St. John the Baptist, whose patronage was transferred in 1307 to the church in Ostr\u00f3g, built around the 12th century by Mieszko IV Tanglefoot. The foundation of the new chapel could not have occurred later than 1292 when construction began, funded by Przemys\u0142aw of Racib\u00f3rz. The dedication was most likely performed by Tomasz II, who sought refuge in Racib\u00f3rz from Duke Henry Probus at that time, although the exact date of the dedication is unknown. In 1288, Bishop Tomasz II founded a collegiate church near the castle chapel as an expression of gratitude for the hospitality received. This event was described by Jan D\u0142ugosz in the Annals or Chronicles of the Famous Kingdom of Poland:Gathering a large army, both from his own soldiers and mercenaries hired with monetary contribution which he levied on the Wroc\u0142aw Church, he militarily invaded the lands of Duke Casimir of Opole and besieged the city of Racib\u00f3rz due to the presence of Bishop Tomasz of Wroc\u0142aw and his clergy there. Although the wealthier citizens of Racib\u00f3rz endured the siege for some time and promised to endure it even longer, the startled populace, feeling the scarcity and lack of food, tormented by hunger, continually wept, groaned loudly, and sighed, hurling curses and insults at Bishop Tomasz and his clergy. Touched by this, Bishop Tomasz, out of great kindness for which he was reputed, said: 'Rather let me and my clergy fall into the hands of the tyrant than these innocent people perish from hunger. We will immediately release from danger those besieged who are dying of fear and hunger. Let us, by our capture or, if it pleases God, by our death, avert the destruction threatening this city, which has sustained us for a long time and granted us refuge'. Then he puts on liturgical garments and orders some clergy to do the same. And thus, wearing the mitre and the episcopal insignia, he sets out from the city with all his clergy in exile, to face the tyrant's camp, to appease his wrath with the greatest humility. (...) The tyrant, who saw his arrival from afar, by God's grace, was seized with such great fear that, leaping from his tent, he ran as fast as he could to meet the bishop, fell face down on the ground, and as if recognizing something divine in the bishop and honoring in him the Eternal Shepherd, begged for forgiveness for his actions. Bishop Tomasz, raising him from the ground, tearfully promised to forgive him all the apostasy he had committed, as long as he persevered in this contrition and piety. And after mutual tearful embraces and kisses, the prince and the bishop entered the nearest church of St. Nicholas without witnesses.As a commemoration of this reconciliation between Bishop Tomasz II of Wroc\u0142aw and Duke Henry Probus, a monument called Unity was erected in Stara Wie\u015b. It was also then that the chapel received the rare dedication of St. Thomas Becket, whose relics were probably brought to the castle. At the collegiate church, three canons and several vicars served, their livelihood supported by tithes from several villages in the duchies of Racib\u00f3rz, Opole, and Cieszyn. In addition, the clergy at the collegiate church served as chancellors, secretaries, as well as tutors and educators to the duke's children. In the early 14th century, a wing of the duke's castle was added to the chapel. In 1309, the altar of St. Margaret was mentioned. In the 14th century, the chapel was further expanded with a porch.\nIn 1416, at the behest of John II, the chapter was transferred from the castle chapel to the parish church. In the 15th and 16th centuries, many of the revenues of the chapel disa",
    "Improvised hide boat used in South and Central America\nJean-Baptiste Debret, Mineiro crossing river.  In this particular example the vessel has the luxury of a wooden gunwale.\nA pelota was an improvised rawhide boat used in South and Central America for crossing rivers.  It was similar in some respects to the coracle of the British Isles or the bull boat of North America, but it had little or no wooden framework or internal supporting structure, often relying entirely on the stiffness of the hide and the outward pressure of the cargo to keep it afloat.  Thus, it could be carried about on horseback and set up quickly in an emergency, a commonplace rural skill.  The vessel was towed by an animal, or by a human swimmer gripping a cord with the teeth, who had to be careful not to swamp it, women being considered particularly dexterous.  Pelotas could convey substantial loads\u2014around a quarter of a ton was common\u2014and even small artillery pieces.  They continued to be used well into the 20th century.\nNecessity\nFording the San Joaqu\u00edn (detail), C\u00e1ndido L\u00f3pez, oil on canvas, Museo Nacional Hist\u00f3rico\nThere were few bridges in these regions and rivers had to be forded or, if too deep, crossed in a pelota.  To cross a river in an emergency e.g. when swollen by torrential rains or during a military campaign, travellers on horseback had to employ such means as were to hand.  They were unlikely to be carrying timber, which in some regions e.g. the treeless pampas might be hard to procure.  Ox-hides were common, however, and many travellers were in the habit of carrying one under their saddle.  (The native recado is a saddle applied in multiple superposed layers, one of which is a large square sheet of rawhide.)\nWrote botanist Auguste de Saint-Hilaire:Since I left the province of Santa Catarina , I had travelled about six hundred leagues, and I had crossed a country cut by numerous rivers; part of this country is rich and flourishing, and yet I did not see a single bridge, sometimes I did not even find any canoe on the banks of the rivers. When this happens, the inhabitants of the country take a rawhide, they knot the four corners of it, and thus form a sort of rounded boat (pelota), to which they attach a strap. Anyone who wants to cross the water sits in this type of canoe and remains motionless while a swimmer, holding the strap between his teeth, pulls it until he reaches the other bank. I have had luggage transported in this way, often very heavy though he was reluctant to entrust his rich collection of specimens to this means of conveyance.\nConstruction\nCrossing the Luj\u00e1n River, Argentina.  The bridge  - the only one in the province  -  often washed away.\nA sun-dried rawhide is inherently rather stiff, and tends to curve preferentially with the hairy side outwards.  The legs were cut off to form a roughly rectangular structure and tied at the four corners to increase its curvature.\nSince animal hides were habitually dried by staking them out on the ground, they came with peg-holes along the margins.  By passing a cord through these eyelets, the curvature could be further enhanced.  The vessel has been compared to the gigantic water-lily of the Amazon. Martin Dobrizhoffer, a Jesuit missionary in Paraguay, recorded that the four sides were raised \"like the upturned brim of a hat\", a distance of about 2 spans.  Sometimes, a few sticks were inserted for internal support, but this was not usually necessary, or always possible.\nIf no cowhide was available, one might be procured by slaughtering an animal on the spot and skinning it.  Since this hide lacked stiffness, however, it was necessary to vary the construction.  The skin was stuffed with, and tied around, a bundle of straw, and only served as a rudimentary float.\nStiffness\nIf the hide was allowed to get wet, it tended to become soft and pliable, hence useless.  Then it was necessary to dry it out, or to use bracing sticks if these could be found.\nF\u00e9lix de Azara, a Spanish colonial official whose duties compelled him to travel through remote regions and who often used the pelota to cross rivers, complained in his travel diary that torrential rains not only caused flooding but gradually made the pelota useless.\nIt was said that if a pelota should take too long to cross a river, as might happen if the towing swimmer grew tired, or lost his hold, the hide would soften up and the vessel might sink.\nPropulsion\nThe hide boat was towed across the river, either by a swimmer pulling a cord with his teeth, or by a bullock, or by holding onto the tail of a horse.  In the Mato Grosso a second swimmer helped to guide it and push it from behind.\nThe French traveller de Moussy, who rode very extensively over Argentina, wrote:\nThis way of crossing rivers was naturally perilous, and more than one accident, sometimes fatal, was the result; but every Argentine countryman knew how to do it and did not hesitate to put it into practice.   Several other sources indicate it was an common rur",

In the General Meeting of January 1930, he proposed changing the name of the entity by adding the \"i\" (Club Femen\u00ed i d'Esports) to expand its cultural and social scope.\nProfessional life\nS\u00e8culi was a professor at the Academia Miralles de Sabadell, the Institute of Culture and Popular Library of Barcelona, and the Workers' Union Federation, At the beginning of the 1930s, she was the secretary of the Permanent Women's Commission of the Catalan Women's Protection Association. On 14 June 1931, she was one of the founders, along with Aurora Bertrana, among others, of the Lyceum Club\u00a0, where she was also secretary.

    "F-type star in the constellation Cetus\nHD 18262 (HR 870, HIP 13679) is an F-type giant or subgiant star located in the constellation Cetus. It has an apparent magnitude of 5.963, which makes it faintly visible to the naked eye. According to the Gaia spacecraft, HD 18262 is located at a distance of 43.79 parsecs (142.8 light-years) and is moving away from Earth at a velocity of 27.4 km/s. Considering the apparent magnitude and the distance, its absolute magnitude is equivalent to 2.79. It belongs to the thin disk population of the Milky Way.\nCharacteristics\nIt is an evolved F-type star that has left the main sequence and is now between a giant star and a subgiant, based on its spectral type of F6III-IVs. The star is 1.54 times more massive than the Sun and has expanded to 2 times its size. It is emitting six times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,400 K, which is around 630 degrees hotter than the Sun's photosphere. The age of HD 18262 is estimated at 1.64 billion years, equivalent to 36% of the Solar System's age. The star is metal-enriched compared to the Sun, the abundance of iron  on its surface is 2.3 higher than that of the Sun, while the oxygen abundance  is 2.9 times higher. Its B-V color index is 0.437, giving it the yellowish-white color of a F-type star.\nThe distance to HD 18262, based on information from the Gaia spacecraft, is of 43.79 parsecs (142.8 light-years). The apparent magnitude of the star is of 5.96m, which is bright enough to be seen to the naked eye under dark sites, far away from light pollution. The absolute magnitude, i.e. its brightness if it was seen at a distance of 10 parsecs (32.6\u00a0ly), is of 2.79. HD 18262 is moving away from Earth at a velocity of 27.38 km/s. It is part of the thin disk population of the Milky Way. Its orbit around the galaxy has a low eccentricity of 0.06 and its distance from the galactic center varies from 7.14 to 8.11 kiloparsecs (23,280 to 26,440 light-years).\nNo debris disks have been detected around this star as of 2016 and no exoplanets have been detected around it as of 2012. A 2019 study analysed the possibility of HD 18262 hosting a giant planet, in five ensembles, analysing five different compositions. The highest possibity was in the second ensemble, where the planet would be formed by volatiles, lithophiles, and sderophiles. In this case, the possibility is of 23%. HD 18262's habitable zone is located at a mean distance of 2.44 astronomical units from it.\nNotes\n^ from logarithms of 0.358 and 0.46 respectively.\n",
    "Football clubTSV Sasel is a sports club from the Hamburg district of Sasel in the Wandsbek district . In addition to association football, the club offers badminton, ballet, basketball, handball, judo, karate, tennis, table tennis, gymnastics and volleyball, with the handball division forming SG Hamburg-Nord together with SC Poppenb\u00fcttel and TSV Duwo 08.\nHistory\nThe club goes back to SV Sasel , which was founded in the spring of 1925 and was joined in 1933 by members of the workers' association FTSV Sasel, which was banned by the National Socialists . In December 1935 the club adopted its current name.\nFootball\nIn 1963, TSV was promoted to what was then the fourth-class Hammonia association league and made it straight into the regional league . Relegation followed in 1966 after the Sasel team lost out in a playoff against the Harburg clubs Borussia and Rasensport . Three years later they were relegated to the district league. It was not until 1994 that TSV returned to higher leagues and in 2001 managed to return to Hamburg's top division, now known as the Verbandsliga .\nWith a third place in the 2002/03 season, Sasel achieved promotion to the Oberliga Nord, Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein season , after the Sasel team, together with Wedeler TSV and TSV Kropp, were able to prevail against VfB L\u00fcbeck in the promotion games . In this league season, TSV reached 12th place in the table out of 18 teams, but had to immediately be relegated back to the Hamburg Association League due to the merger of the two seasons into a single-track Oberliga Nord . Back in the association league, TSV celebrated the championship in the 2004/05 season . However, due to the complex licensing process, the club decided against promotion.\nThe successful team then fell apart and was relegated to the regional league a year later. There the team came third in the Hansa relay in the 2010/11 season and prevailed on penalties against FC Elmshorn in the playoff for promotion to the Hamburg Oberliga . However, TSV Sasel finished the 2011/12 season at the bottom of the table with only ten points and 100 goals conceded. Only one game of the season could be won. After two seventh places and one sixth place in the regional league, the club was in first place in the regional league Hammonia at the winter break of 2015/16 , but missed the return to the Oberliga Hamburg at the end of the season as third in the table. In the 2016/17 season, Sasel became champions of the regional league and was promoted back to the top league. After TSV Sasel was able to finish the season in the top half of the table there for three years in a row, they achieved the greatest cup success in the club's history in the 2019/20 season when the team reached the final of the Hamburg Cup . However, this was lost 5-1 against the regional league team Eintracht Norderstedt . Sasel ended the 2022/23 season as Hamburg champions. \u00a0The team also reached the final of the Hamburg Cup again, which they lost 0-1 against FC Teutonia 05 Ottensen . At the end of the season, Daniel Zankl ended his coaching career at Sasel after nine years. It had already been announced in March that Marco Stier would be his successor. \u00a0At the end of February 2024, he resigned from office with immediate effect for health reasons.\nAchievements\nChampions of the Verbandsliga/ Oberliga Hamburg\u00a0: 2005, 2023\nVenues\nWhile the first men's team generally plays its home games on the Parkweg sports field , the football games of the other teams, especially those of the youth teams, also take place on the Alsterredder school sports field of the Oberalster high school .\nThe sports field on Saseler Parkweg was a grand square for a long time . Since such a surface is not permitted for games in the Oberliga Nord , the first men's team had to use the Alsterredder school sports field , which is a grass field, for their home games in the 2003/04 Oberliga season .\nIn 2013 the Grandplatz was replaced by an artificial turf pitch. \u00a0In addition, privacy walls were built on the north and east sides of the square. \u00a0As part of this renovation, the sports field on Parkweg was renamed the Alfred Mager Stadium in the summer of that year . \u00a0This honors Alfred Mager, who was chairman of the TSV for 45 years. \nTable tennis\nThe club's table tennis department consists of eight men's, four boys' and three student teams in the 2023/24 season. The first men's team plays in the Oberliga Nord-Ost. In the youth sector, Sasel plays in the performance class, the highest league in Hamburg, for both boys (U19) and school students (over 15). \u00a0The club's top player is the former German international Oliver Alke . \nHandball\nIn the mid-1980s, the HSG Sasel/DUWO syndicate was founded with TSV Duwo 08 , \u00a0which achieved promotion to the Regionalliga Nord several times, but was unable to establish itself there. When the syndicate was expanded to include the SC Poppenb\u00fcttel handball department in May 2005 , it renamed itself SG Hamburg-Nord . \u00a0With around 1,000 member",

    "Prison camp during the Bosnian War\nKamenica camp or Gostovi\u0107i camp was a prison camp operated by the El Mud\u017eahid, a force of Muslim volunteers operating as part of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ABiH) during the Bosnian War.\nThe camp\nThe camp was located in the Gostovi\u0107i valley, 10 kilometres south of the town of Zavidovici in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was solely manned by elements of the El Mud\u017eahid who although were an independent volunteer force, were under the command of the ABiH. The camp was in operation throughout mid-1995 and housed Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) POWs and Serb civilians captured during the four-month Battle of Vozu\u0107a.\nAtrocities\nThe Battle of Vozu\u0107a commenced on 27 May 1995. By 21 July, over a dozen VRS soldiers were captured on Mount Ozren and brought to Kamenica camp by the El Mud\u017eahid. The POWs, some injured, were subjected to acts of torture and were provided inadequate food and water. One of the POWs was reportedly beheaded by the El Mud\u017eahid, with a surviving captive forced to kiss the severed head of their fellow soldier. The severed head was hanged on a wall in a room housing the prisoners.\nOn 10 September 1995, ten VRS soldiers surrendered to soldiers of the ABiH. After being taken to ABiH headquarters, they were transported to Kamenica camp and arrived on 17 September 1995. After arriving at the camp, the captives were beaten. During this time period, an elderly Serb civilian was brought to the camp and joined the POWs. The Serb civilian was beaten and stripped of his clothes. He subsequently died. On 29 September 1995, the ten POWs were transferred to Zenica.\nOn 11 September 1995, approximately 60 VRS soldiers and an unknown number of Serb civilians were captured in the village of Vozu\u0107a by the ARBiH. The captured Serbs were ordered to march to the village of Kesten where en route, two VRS POWs were killed. After arriving at Kesten, members of the El Mud\u017eahid seized the Serb captives from their ARBiH guards at gunpoint. The captured Serbs were transported to Kamenica camp where the POWs and civilians (including three women) were held separately. The three female civilians were subjected to beatings and sexual assault, including rape. The POWs were subjected to acts of torture including the severing of body parts, roasting, fracturing of limbs and gouging of the eyes. All POWs captured in Vozu\u0107a were executed, with many subjected to beheading and post-death mutilation of the body. The three female captives were later released.\nTrials\nIn 2005, Rasim Deli\u0107, former chief of staff of the ABiH who in 1993 signed an order authorising the formation of the El Mud\u017eahid, was indicted for war crimes that included crimes committed at the Kamenica camp. Deli\u0107 was found guilty and sentenced to three years imprisonment for failing to prevent or punish the cruel treatment captives at Kamenica camp. In 2015, Sakib Mahmuljin, former commander of the 3rd Corps of the Army of ABiH was indicted for war crimes that also included crimes committed at the Kamenica camp. In 2021, Mahmuljin was found guilty and sentence to eight years imprisonment. However, Mahmuljin fled to Turkey and subsequent requests for extradition have remained unanswered.\n",
    "Insurrection\nMalakand revolt refers to an insurrection by Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi under the command of Sufi Muhammadin Malakand Division on the basis of a demand for Sharia law. Multiple areas were captured by the militants. The uprising was quashed by the Pakistan army, captured areas were liberated and a peace deal was  negotiated. It was the first Salafi jihadist uprising in Pakistan.\nBackground\nIn northwest Pakistan, three princely states Dir, Swat and Chitral were abolished and reorganised to form the Malakand Division in 1970. This also abolished the laws of princely state especially the Sharia implementation in Swat. During the Soviet Afghan war, many militants from this area went to Afghanistan for Jihad. Upon returning they started campaigning for Sharia law and established an organisation named as Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi.\nRebellion\nNovember 1994 insurrection\nIn November 1994, Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi under Sufi Muhammad led a revolt for the implementation of Sharia law in the Malakand Division. A large number of Afghan Mujahideen from the nearby areas also came to aid the rebellion. Timergara, the headquarters of Lower Dir, was besieged by government, artillery Shelling was carried out and fighting erupted in Swat. The Saidu Sharif Airport, roads multiple police stations and judicial courts in the area were occupied by the militants. The Sharia law was implemented in the occupied areas. They imposed driving on the right side of the road as a symbol of discontinuing British traditions. The militants established check points on mountain peaks to prevent military from entering. Approximately 40 persons, including 12 security force personnel, were killed in a week of combat before the Government quelled the rebellion. Pakistan army deployed combat and reconnaissance helicopters to the area. The Frontier Corps was deployed to regain control of the area.\nDecember 1994 clashes\nOn December 4, 1994, 10,000 members of the TNSM started rally for the release of 85 captured militants but security forces responded with tear gas shelling.\nJune 1995 clashes\nOn June 19, 1995, the TNSM Chief Sufi Muhammad and 20 senior militants  were arrested following an attack on security forces. In response hundreds of TNSM cadres attacked and occupied Government offices in the Swat district wounding 26 people.\nAftermath\nAfter the introduction of the \nPATA Regulation, the provincial government recommended the introduction of the Shariah law.

    "Football clubSV Steinbach 1920 eV is a German sports club based in the Steinbach district of the Hessian market town of Burghaun in the Fulda district.\nHistory\nFootball\nFounding and pre-war period (1920 \u2013 1945)\nThe club was founded under the name Gymnastics and Football Club Steinbach in the Walk inn in Steinbach on June 20, 1920. A few years later the name of the club was changed to Sportverein Steinbach 1920 . At first, the club played its football games on improvised fields. There was no fixed venue and so the club constantly changed venues. In 1924 it was accepted into the C class of the H\u00fcnfeld district .\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, the 18-year-old player Anselm Henkel was so seriously injured during a game in K\u00fcnzell that he died as a result of these injuries. Because of the death, many older players left the club, which initially had difficulty compensating for this loss. However, before the outbreak of the Second World War, a few friendly games were played against neighboring communities; shortly after the outbreak, play came to a complete standstill.\nEstablishment in the post-war period (1945 \u2013 1993)\nAfter the end of the World War, the first friendly games were played again in 1945. In 1947, H\u00fcnfeld was accepted into the B class and thus returned to regular league operations. Promotion to the A class (then the 8th league) was celebrated in 1951, in which the club was able to stay for two seasons until it was relegated back to the B class in 1953 . They were promoted again in 1956 and relegated again in 1959. In 1971 the team was promoted to the district class and created euphoria. More than 1,000 paying spectators regularly attended the home games. In 1974 the team was relegated to the A class again, but a season later Steinbach reported again from the district class . This rescue only lasted for one season, as the team was relegated again in 1976. It wasn't until 1985 that they were promoted back to the district class. A year later, the team played in a friendly against Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen , which was lost 14-0 in front of 800 spectators. The following year they were relegated to the A-Class again . In 1990 the club was awarded the Sepp-Herberger Medal by Werner Kiel for the work it had done, particularly in the area of youth . In 1993 the team was promoted back to the district league . \nSeveral ascents up to the present day (2000 \u2013 present)\nIn 2001 they were promoted to the national league . After two seasons, however, they were relegated back to the district league in 2003. Three seasons later, Steinbach had to go back down to the district league, whereupon immediate promotion was achieved in 2007 with 80 points. In the same year, the M\u00fchlengrund team was also voted team of the year in East Hesse . In 2008, the SVS was promoted to the Hessen Nord association league again and thus made it through. Previously, the team was once again the superior champion of the group league (then: district league) with 83 points. In 2013, the youth department joined the Burghaun youth development association . The 2016/17 season saw promotion to the Hessenliga for the first time . With 36 points, the first season in Hesse's Beletage ended in 14th place. In the next season , however, the team was relegated as bottom of the table with only 15 points. In the 2018/19 season, they were promoted back to the Hessenliga.\nWeb links\nhttps://sportverein-steinbach.com/\n",

    "Transwestern Pipeline Company v. Corinne Grace was a hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on May 25, 1990. Transwestern Pipeline claimed that Grace, an independent oil and gas operator, had a well that was misclassified by the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (NM OCD) as what is called a stripper well under \u00a7108 (Ceiling Price for Stripper Well Natural Gas) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). A stripper well is a well that is marginally productive. The underlying issue was the geology of the Morrow Formation in New Mexico and the reliability of the information the oil and gas commission of one state had based its decision on based on this type of geological formation and its characteristics. Around this same time, Corinne Grace was also in the 1990 FERC hearing for Corinne B. Grace v. El Paso Natural Gas Company.\nThe hearing had a significant effect on U.S. oil and gas supply because of the number of stripper wells and their ability to supply natural gas for the U.S. economy. In recent history, stripper well production makes up about 8.2% of United States natural gas production, and the stripper well classification is the classification of a large majority of the number of U.S. onshore wells.\nBackground\nThe NGPA defined a stripper well as essentially a well that produces less than 60 Mcf (60,000 cubic feet) per day during any 90-day interval. However, there was an exclusion or exemption for wells that had the application of what is defined as enhanced recovery in the NPGA.\nEnhanced recovery legislation\nThe following defined enhanced recovery as legislated by the NGPA:\nNonassociated natural gas (gas from different geological zones) which is produced from a stripper well that actually exceeds 60 Mcf during any 90-day production period may continue to qualify as stripper well natural gas if the increase in this well production was the result of the application of recognized enhanced recovery techniques.\nThis encouraged oil and gas operators to try to increase production from marginally productive wells by producing from new zones in the well. This in turn helped with U.S. natural gas supply.\nNGPA Pricing Mechanism\nSection 108 of the NGPA gave a price ceiling for stripper well natural gas. In May 1978, it was $2.09. Section 102 of the NGPA provides a financial incentive for oil and gas operators who develop new gas production from new zones. FERC describes the application of these two sections in its concluding remarks:New Mexico has approved recompletions\u00a0such as Grace's as enhanced recovery techniques under section 108 but it has not approved applications for a new onshore reservoir determination under section 102 for any well in the pool, even if\u00a0the well appears not to be in communication with any other well in the pool, because the pool produced before April 20, 1977.\nThis result is also consistent with the pricing scheme established in the NGPA because the section 102 ceiling price, which applies to gas from new onshore reservoirs which did not produce before April 20, 1977, was intended to reward producers\u00a0for incurring the risks involved in exploring for new sources of\u00a0gas.\u00a0 Since producers who drill in the pool know that if they\u00a0drill to a certain depth that they will encounter the Morrow\u00a0Formation, with the possibility of multiple pay zones, they do\u00a0not bear as great a risk as other producers.\nConclusion\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission agree that the State of New Mexico Oil and Gas Commission was correct in its application of allowing NGPA Section 108 pricing to take place as well as to deny Section 102 pricing. Grace was declared correct and Transwestern's requests were denied.\n",

Johannes Engst and Johann Baucke, members of a group of German Moravian missionaries, built the house in the late 1860s alongside Baucke's son William. The building was constructed from stone sourced from the nearby volcanic cone, Maunganui Bluff. The Moravian mission in the Chathams was broadly unsuccessful (failing to gain a single convert on the islands), and Engst alone stayed on the island, residing as a farmer at the house until his retirement in 1900. The house continues to serve as a private residence, although it is frequently visited by tourists to the islands. In 1991, it was listed as a Category 1 historic place by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Repair work was intermittently carried out on the structure from 1998 to 2010 in response to damage to the masonry.\nHistory\nJohannes Engst, 1874The house and surroundings during Engst's residence, 1870s\nIn 1842, five German Moravian Church missionaries were sent to New Zealand by the Gossner Mission, led by schoolmaster Franz Schirmeister. Unable to find a suitable location to preach, they sailed to the Chatham Islands. They arrived in February 1843, initially settling at Te Whakaru on the main island of Chatham. Although ultimately failing to make any converts among either the M\u0101ori or Moriori inhabitants of the islands, they are credited with the introduction of shipbuilding and sheep farming, and established the island's first school.\nAll members of the mission lived apart for some time in order to connect with the local community. From 1866 to 1868 Johannes Gottfried Engst and Johann Baucke, alongside Baucke's son William (born on the island), constructed a stone cottage at Maunganui on the northern coast. The cottage was constructed with stone from the adjacent Maunganui Bluff, a 178\u00a0m (584\u00a0ft) volcanic cone, using mortar derived from pipi shells. The doors and window lintels of the house were made from akeake wood. In addition to sheepherding, the missionaries grew orchard trees, vegetables, and macrocarpa at the site. Several outbuildings, including a woolshed and stable, were constructed at the site, although only the Mission House is now extant.\nJohann Baucke left the Chathams in the late 1860s, following a land feud and the death of his wife. Engst continued to live and farm at the site, employing Baucke's children as labourers. Reverend P. C. Anderson visited the house in 1882, describing it as \"a capital house... The blocks of which it is built are nearly a foot square, cut with the axe, so it must have involved an enormous amount of labour to build.\" Engst retired from farming in 1900, around eighty years old, and moved to Te One, where he died in 1910.\nModern history\nThe German Mission House remains a private residence. Various small improvements and additions have been added to the structure by its owners since its construction. It is frequently visited by tourists, although its remote location requires a half-day round trip by vehicle. An entry fee and prior permission from the owners is required to visit the site.\nStructure\nWindow and garden of the house, 2023.\nThe German Mission House is rectangular, with a gable roof. Initially thatched, the modern roof is fashioned out of corrugated iron. The exterior stonework of the structure was initially exposed, but later plastered with lime. Early in its history, a veranda was installed on the building, but it has since been removed, leaving only a foundation line. Bedrooms were placed inside the roof, accessible by a staircase on the western side of the house. These were initially lit on either end by windows in the western and eastern ends of the house; however, the eastern window has since been removed.\nThe building's ground floor is constructed from blocks of tuff and basalt, sourced from the western edge of the house. A stone-lined cellar was built at this spot. Timber floors are placed above this foundation. The building is split into three rooms, the middle the largest, each of which contains a casement window on the north side. The internal walls between these rooms are constructed from ponga logs, with plaster lining.\nModern interior fixtures for the kitchen and laundry have been installed in the house, alongside a modern bathroom in the eastern room. A lean-to was added in 1955. A possible earlier lean-to is evidenced by remaining stone foundations. Two chimneys, one on the southern wall and one on the western, were initially installed. The western chimney collapsed at some point before 2010.\nConservation and repairs\nThe house and surroundings, 2023.\nThe house was listed as a Category 1 historic place by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (NZHPT) on 11 November 1991.

    "American botanist and author (1889\u20131965)\nMarie Catherine Neal (December 7, 1889 \u2013 June 6, 1965) was an American botanist and author known for her contributions to the study of Hawaiian flora and her efforts to popularize botanical knowledge.\nBiography\nEarly life and education\nMarie Catherine Neal was born on December 7, 1889, in Southington, Connecticut, to Linus B. Neal, a banker, and Eva W. Chedney. Her interest in nature was sparked during childhood hunting and fishing excursions with her father, leading to a lifelong passion for botany.\nNeal pursued her education at Smith College, graduating in 1912 with a B.A. degree. Her studies included a course in botany. During her college years, she gained administrative experience working as a secretary for various organizations. She received an MS degree from Yale University in 1925.\nCareer\nFollowing her graduation, Neal began her career in botany as a secretary in the geology department at Yale under Herbert E. Gregory. In 1920, she moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, to continue her work for Gregory at the Bishop Museum. Initially placed in the conchology department, Neal's botanical interests led her to focus on Hawaiian flora. During her tenure at the Bishop Museum from 1920 to 1930, Neal made notable contributions to the study of Hawaiian plants. She collaborated on research projects, including cataloging terrestrial mollusks and coauthoring a monograph on land snails.\nNeal's expertise in botany extended beyond academia. She contributed articles to the Paradise of the Pacific magazine, popularizing her knowledge of Hawaii's cultivated plants. In 1928, Neal coauthored her first major book, \"In Honolulu Gardens,\" which provided scientific descriptions and illustrations of Hawaiian plants. The book received acclaim for its blend of botanical information with Hawaiian legends and folklore.\nContributions to botany\nIn 1930, Neal was appointed botanist at the Bishop Museum, where she expanded the herbarium collections and earned international recognition for her scholarship. She assisted scholars and the public in identifying Hawaiian plants and contributed to the museum's educational initiatives. Neal's botanical research extended to the outer islands of Hawaii, where she conducted extensive fieldwork, discovering new plant species and conducting research for her publications.\nLater life and legacy\nMarie Catherine Neal's significant work, In Gardens of Hawaii, published in 1948 and revised in 1965, described over 2,000 botanic species with detailed scientific information and illustrations. Neal's contributions to botany were recognized, and she received honors for her scientific achievements. She died on June 6, 1965.\nThe standard author abbreviation M.Neal is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.\n",
    "Genus of lichens\nPseudotopeliopsis is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. It has two species.\nTaxonomy\nThe genus was circumscribed in 2012 by the lichenologists Sittiporn Parnmen, Robert L\u00fccking, and H. Thorsten Lumbsch. They assigned Pseudotopeliopsis laceratula as the type species; this lichen was originally named as a member of genus Thelotrema by Johannes M\u00fcller Argoviensis in 1887. The genus name is derived from the Greek word pseudo, meaning \"false\", combined with the name Topeliopsis, alluding to its resemblance to that genus.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Pseudotopeliopsis typically has dense outer layer, or cortex. The apothecia (fruiting bodies) emerge from the thallus and are rounded to irregularly shaped. These apothecia feature a disc that resembles a small pore and is covered by concentrically layered, fissured, and lobulated margins. The surrounding tissue of the apothecia, known as the excipulum, varies from colourless to brown.\nThe spores of Pseudotopeliopsis are elongated, ranging from fusiform-ellipsoid to oblong-cylindrical in shape, and are divided by cross walls (septa) that may be slightly thickened and form angular spaces within the spore. These spores are initially colourless and can turn brown as they age. They do not react to staining with iodine solution.\nChemically, this genus does not produce any notable secondary metabolites (lichen products) that are detectable with standard chemical spot tests. Pseudotopeliopsis is distinct from the closely related genus Chapsa primarily due to its denser cortex and the unique structure of its apothecia, which resemble those of the genus Topeliopsis with their striated tissue filling the disc\u2013a distinctive structural feature that sets it apart from similar genera.\nSpecies\nPseudotopeliopsis laceratula (M\u00fcll.Arg.) Parnmen, L\u00fccking & Lumbsch (2012)\nPseudotopeliopsis longispora Papong, L\u00fccking & Parnmen (2015)\nAlthough the genus was originally circumscribed with four species, three of those have since been transferred to other genera:\nPseudotopeliopsis aggregata (Hale) Parnmen, L\u00fccking & Lumbsch (2012) is now Nitidochapsa aggregata\nPseudotopeliopsis scabiocarpa (Rivas Plata & L\u00fccking) Parnmen, L\u00fccking & Lumbsch (2012) is now Chapsa scabiocarpa\nPseudotopeliopsis scabiomarginata (Hale) Parnmen, L\u00fccking & Lumbsch (2012) is now Chapsa scabiomarginata.\n",
    "Football club\nAskania Bernburg is a German football club based in the city of Bernburg, located in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The club was founded on March 15, 1909, and has a rich history in regional football competitions.\nHistory\nEarly years\nAskania Bernburg was established in 1909 as FC Askania 09 Bernburg. The club initially played friendly matches against other local teams before joining competitive leagues. In the early years, Askania Bernburg primarily participated in local and regional competitions in Saxony-Anhalt.\nPost-War era\nFollowing World War II, Askania Bernburg faced challenges due to the political and social changes in the region. The club managed to rebuild and resumed its football activities in regional leagues. Throughout the post-war era, Askania Bernburg competed in various divisions of German football.\nRise to prominence\nIn the 1990s, Askania Bernburg experienced success and achieved several promotions, climbing up the German football league system. The club reached its peak in the early 2000s when it competed in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord, the fourth tier of German football at the time.\nRecent years\nIn recent years, Askania Bernburg has participated in regional leagues, including the Landesliga Sachsen-Anhalt. The club has maintained a presence in regional football and continues to compete against other teams in Saxony-Anhalt.\nOn July 25, 1952, the state parliament of Saxony-Anhalt passed the \u201cLaw on the further democratization, structure and functioning of state bodies in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.\u201d This meant the dissolution of the previous state into the districts of Magdeburg and Halle and thus the formation of the Bernburg district in the Halle district. The result was the definition of new leagues. The first team of BSG Empor Bernburg became a founding member of the third-class Halle district league, which consists of a total of 12 teams. Below the district league there were the district and district classes, above the upper league and the DS league.\nIn 1952 the club was renamed BSG Chemie Bernburg. As early as 1954 he was relegated from the district league. When competitive sports were separated from popular sports in 1954, all sports associations except SV Medizin and SV Post founded a sports club (SC), sometimes several. The chemistry, glass and ceramics union sector founded SC Chemie Halle-Leuna, today's SV Halle, in what was then the district town of Halle (Saale).\nIn 1957, BSG Chemie Bernburg, together with Stahl Helbra, managed to return to the district's top division, which this time was held for nine years until 1966. The best results were the runner-up championships won in 1959 and 1963 behind Motor Aschersleben and HSG Wissenschaft Halle, with which Chemie Bernburg narrowly failed to gain promotion to the Second GDR League.\nIn the period that followed, it was no longer possible to return to the district league; the BSG only appeared in the Halle district league until 1991. In 1990 the club renamed itself Askania Bernburg. From 1994 to 2014, Askania Bernburg operated consistently between the Saxony-Anhalt Association League and the state league. In 2014, as runners-up, they celebrated promotion to the fifth-class Oberliga Nordost and benefited from the renunciation of the champions BSV Halle-Amendorf\nStadium\nAskania Bernburg plays its home matches at the Sparkassen Arena.\nSee also\nList of football clubs in Germany\n",

    "A letter of homage from the Jewish Community of Magenza celebrating the election of Emmerich Joseph von Breidbach zu B\u00fcrresheim as the Prince-Elector of Mainz on 5 July 1763.\nThe Jewish Community of Mainz had significance throughout Europe in the High Middle Ages, was destroyed several times, and has re-emerged even after the Holocaust.\nUntil the 11th Century\nGravestone of Yaakov ben Yakar\nThe origins of the Jewish community in Mainz are unclear. It is assumed that Jews had already come to the Middle Rhine during the time of the Roman Empire. However, there is so far no evidence for this assumption in Mainz. The first reliable evidence of a Jewish community is provided by rabbinical legal opinions from the second half of the 10th century, when a flourishing community already existed in Mainz. In the 10th century, Jewish families also began immigrating from Italy and southern France. The community in Mainz became a well-known center of Ashkenazic Judaism. The most famous scholar of that time was Gershom ben Judah, born around 960 in Metz, who worked in Mainz, where he died in 1028 or 1040. He founded a Jewish academy (Yeshiva) and thus strengthened a form of Judaism independent of the tradition of the Babylonian religious schools. Simeon bar Isaac was a rabbi and leader of the Jewish community of Mainz.\nThe oldest archaeological evidence of the Jewish community of Mainz dates from the 11th century.\n11th Century\nIn 1093, a synagogue was mentioned for the first time, located on the corner plot at Schusterstrasse/Stadthausstrasse. The oldest gravestone in the old Jewish cemetery - the only Jewish cemetery in Mainz until 1880 - dates from 1049 and is thus the oldest in Central Europe. At that time, the residential area of the Jews was located along the Rhine between the Fischtor and Karmeliterkirche gates. This residential quarter was not a ghetto; rather, most of the inhabitants there were non-Jews. A synod in 1310 prohibited this mixed dwelling.\nThe leading class of Mainz Jews was primarily involved in long-distance trade. From Mainz, the Jews traded in spices, silk, furs and metalwares. The Jewish residential quarter was conveniently located for this, as the trade center Am Brand, the city's most important market for goods arriving by ship, was located just to the south. There was also a spatial proximity to the prince-elector's court. The king had entrusted the protection of the Jews to the Prince-Elector of Mainz. The Jews were also active in lending, which was hindered for the Christian population by the prohibition of interest. Jews also owned vineyards both inside and outside the city. They were considered free and able to bear arms, allowed to keep non-Christian slaves, and able to live according to their own laws, which increasingly conformed to the laws of non-Jews by the beginning of the 13th century.\nThe community was led by parnasim, trustees and elders who together formed the Jewish council.\nThe privileges for Jewish merchants regulated in Jewish law were already the subject of hostilities in the 11th century. In 1012, King Heinrich II expelled the Jews from Mainz for the first time. In 1084, after a fire in the Jewish quarter, there were clashes that led to the flight of Jews to Speyer, where the local bishop, R\u00fcdiger Huzmann, granted them a favorable privilege, thereby promoting the town's development.\nCrusade of 1096\nThe most serious event in the history of the medieval Jewish community in Mainz was the Crusade (anti-Jewish pogrom) of 1096, in which Archbishop Ruthard completely failed in the task of protecting the Jews that had been entrusted to him by the Emperor.\nIn the Jewish liturgy, the victims of this massacre are commemorated under the name Gezerot Tatnu (\"Persecution of the Year 4856\" (according to the Jewish calendar)).\nIn 1097, Emperor Henry IV enabled those who had been forced to convert during the pogrom to return to their ancestral faith. The Jewish community thus continued to exist.\nNew beginning: 11th to 14th Century\nPogroms in Central Europe 1348\u20131349\nTogether with the communities in Speyer and Worms, the community of Mainz formed the center of Ashkenazic Judaism. These three Shum cities - Shpira (Speyer), Vermaisia (Worms) and Magenza (Mainz) - formed an association from the 12th to the 14th century, had joint advisory bodies, and from the 1220s a common law (Taqqanot Qehillot Shum) with high authority in northern Central Europe.\nThe protection of the Jews was the responsibility of the Emperor, for which they paid him taxes, a responsibility that he had granted to the Archbishop of Mainz as an imperial fief. After receiving municipal freedom in 1244, this responsibility passed to the City of Mainz in 1295.\nDuring all further Crusades there were outbursts against the Jews of the city, though these did not reach the dimension of the pogrom of 1096. In the 14th century, anti-Jewish sentiments intensified again. On 28 August 1349, there was a major pogrom in Mainz that few Jews su",
    "Football club in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany\nFootball club\nFSV Barleben 1911 is a football club from the unified municipality of Barleben in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. The home of the club is the sports field at Barleber Anger. The biggest success in the club's history is the winning of the national championship title 2014/15.\nThe first team has been playing in the Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt since 2018 after the voluntary withdrawal from the southern relay of the Oberliga Nordost and has been trained by Christoph Grabinski since July 2021.\nPrehistory\nThe chronicle of Barleber football goes back to 1911, when the first sports club with a football section was founded. In the early years, however, the association did not appear nationwide. After the end of the Second World War, the club was dissolved in 1945 at the instigation of the Soviet occupying power, but sports activities continued to exist. In the course of the reorganization of company sports on a production basis, the BSG VEM Barleben was created in 1948, a company sports community, which was joined by the sports community formed in 1945. In the following years, the club, renamed BSG Motor Barleben in 1950, achieved some success. For example, they belonged to the Bezirksliga Magdeburg from 1952 to 1954 and 1956/1957. From 1957 until the reunification of both German states, Barleben played continuously in the district class for many years, but in 1987/88 he was relegated to the district league. With the end of the GDR, the BSG Motor Barleben was refounded into SG Motor Barleben.\nAfter the introduction of the DFB league system in East Germany, SG Motor Barleben therefore found itself at district level for the 1990/91 season. In the mid-1990s, Barleber football managed to return to FSA level with the promotion to the state class.\nHistory\nIn 1997, the footballers went their own way and left SG Motor Barleben and founded their own club. In tradition to the first Barleben football team, they called the club FSV Barleben 1911. At the end of the 2003/04 season, the FSV was relegated from the state class after long-standing affiliation. Only the absence of relegated in the Ohrekreisliga prevented the further decline of the club in 2005. It was not until 2008 that the Red-Blacks found they back in national football, whereby with a new promotion they even succeeded in the march into the now seventh-class state league. Although the club had to accept the direct relegation, the immediate re-promotion to the Landesliga Nord followed in the year of the 100th anniversary. After the placements three and four, FSV Barleben rose undefeated to the Verbandsliga Saxony-Anhalt with first place in 2014. In 2015, winning the state championship of Saxony-Anhalt succeeded in the first promotion to the Oberliga, so that the club was active for the first time in the fifth highest division of the DFB league system in the 2015/16 season. In the new league, the team of coach Mario Middendorf with ninth place already managed the safe class preservation with a few match days before the end of the season, which with a 13. Place was also realized in the following season. After the third season in the Oberliga, the first under coach J\u00f6rn Schulz, and the renewed sporting class retention, the club withdrew to the Verbandsliga for economic reasons.\nStadium\nThe club usually plays its home games on the sports field at Barleber Anger, which has a lawn (main square) and an artificial turf field. However, if games are due that require a higher level of security or if more than 1,000 spectators are expected to play at home, they will not take place on the home sports field.\nPlayers and coaches of the men's team\nSaxony-Anhalt Cup\nSuccesses\nHall district master district of B\u00f6rde (2007/08)\nDistrict Master District of B\u00f6rde (2007/08)\nChampion State Class 4 (2008/09)\nChampion State Class 2 (2010/11)\nChampion Landesliga Nord (2013/14)\nNational Champion Saxony-Anhalt (2014/15)\nExternal links\nwww.fsvbarleben.de\nHighlights: Highlights: FSV Barleben - 1.

    "An mpisikidy practices sikidy in 1900\nSikidy is a form of algebraic geomancy practiced by Malagasy peoples in Madagascar. It involves algorithmic operations performed on random data generated from tree seeds, which are ritually arranged in a tableau called a toetry and divinely interpreted after being mathematically operated on. Based on their figurations, columns of seeds are designated \"slaves\" or \"princes\" belonging to respective \"lands\" for each, and interact symbolically to express vintana ('fate') in the interpretation of the diviner. \nThe centuries-old practice derives from Islamic influence brought to the island by pre-colonial Arab traders. The sikidy is consulted for a range of divinatory questions pertaining to fate and the future, including identifying sources of and rectifying misfortune, reading the fate of newborns, and planning annual migrations.\nThe mathematics of sikidy include the concepts of Boolean algebra, symbolic logic and parity.\nHistory\nAn mpisikidy practices sikidy in 1895\nThe practice is several centuries old, and is influenced by Arab geomantic traditions of Arab Muslim traders on the island. Stephen Ellis and Solofo Randrianja describe sikidy as \"probably one of the oldest components of Malagasy culture\", writing that it most likely the product of an indigenous divinatory art later influenced by Islamic practice. Most writers link the practice to the \"sea-going trade involving the southwest coast of India, the Persian Gulf, and the east coast of Africa in the 9th or 10th century C.E.\" Though the etymology of sikidy is unknown, it has been posited that the word derives from the Arabic sichr ('incantation' or 'charm'). Sikidy was of central importance to pre-Christian Malagasy religion, with one practitioner quoted in 1892 as calling sikidy \"the Bible of our ancestors\". A missionary report from 1616 describes one form of sikidy using tree seeds, and another using fingered markings in the sand. The early colonial French governor of Madagascar, \u00c9tienne de Flacourt, documented sikidy in the mid-17th century:\nMatatane country in southeastern Madagascar  where the Antemoro  live was a center of astrological study as early as the fourteenth century . This area was also the site of early Arab settlements, although strict Islamic observances were lost centuries ago . Historical evidence shows that Antemoro diviners, bearers of the astrological system, infiltrated nearly all the ancient kingdoms of Madagascar beginning in the sixteenth century.  Today, although many persons claim to be ombiasy , only the Antemoro diviners are considered true professionals. The area is still a famous place of learning where specialists go for training and then return to their home communities with a certain body of knowledge. Now we can better understand the degree of similarity of divination forms found throughout Madagascar. For centuries Matitanana has remained a training center for diviners who have migrated widely, usually attaining important positions in their home communities and with various royal families.\u2014\u200a\u00c9tienne de Flacourt, l'Histoire de la Grande Isle Madagascar\nOrigin myths\nMythic tradition relating to the origin of sikidy \"links  both to the return by walking on water of Arab ancestors who had intermarried with Malagasy but then left, and to the names of the days of the week\" and holds that the art was supernaturally communicated to the ancestors, with Zanahary (the supreme deity of Malagasy religion) giving it to Ranakandriana, who then gave it to a line of diviners (Ranakandriana to Ramanitralanana to Rabibi-andrano to Andriambavi-maitso), the last of whom, the female diviner Andriambavi-maitso, terminated the monopoly by giving it to the people, declaring: \"Behold, I give you the sikidy, of which you may inquire what offerings you should present in order to obtain blessings; and what expiation you should make so as to avert evils, when any are ill or under apprehension of some future calamity\".\nA mythic anecdote of Ranakandriana says that two men observed him one day playing in the sand. In fact he was practicing a form of sikidy worked in sand called sikidy alanana. The two men seized him, and Ranakandriana promised that he would teach them something if they released him. They agreed, and Ranakandriana taught them in depth how to work the sikidy. The two men then went to their chief and told him that they could tell him \"the past and the future\u2014what was good and what was bad\u2014what increased and what diminished.\" The chief asked them to tell him how he could obtain plenty of cattle. The two men worked their sikidy and told the chief to kill all of his bulls, and that \"great numbers would come to him\" on the following Friday. The chieftain, doubting, asked what would happen if their prediction didn't come true, and the two men promised they would pay with their lives. The chief agreed and killed his bulls.

There's a lot of technical upgrades and a story behind them. The car was used and rebuilt in the past by William Bruce \"Billy\" McNair, a Porsche specialist from the San Francisco area. He rebuilt the engine and stroked it from a stock 3.0 to a very strong 3.2. McNair modified it using Elephant Racing components. McNair passed away in 2019. The car was then purchased by Pawe\u0142 Kalinowski, who wanted to continue this story through styling that McNair started.\nThis car was modified by the CarBone company and is not correct in accordance with the original. It is, however, one hundred percent correct with the owner's plans concerning the car. No factory signs, logos to keep the car clear. Many areas of the car's design were inspired by unism \u2014 an art movement from the city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland. Pattern on the Targa bar, grill, floor boards, shifter coupler cover, headrests and the crest on the hood.

The seats are ultra-rare Recaro Rally II and boast a one-off upholstery in iconic pasha motif adapted to leather.\nThe car is painted to the original and correct Mocha Brown. The clear coat is matt to emphasize a new chapter for the original work. CarBone Bi-LED lights fill up the dark look of the car. The rear light cluster was tinted. Campagnolo wheels are in a dark, matt, gun metal shade, a reference to those used in 70's rally Porsches. Toyo R888 tires. The two pipes of a bypass muffler. It is radio controlled by a switch on the dashboard. The tunnel icon on a switch is a novelty detail. \nThe name \"Criollo\" was given to the car by Kalinowski. The brown color of the car reminded him of dark cocoa. A criollo is one of the most exclusive types of cocoa.\nKalinowski wanted to send the car to the United States to visit McNair's family. This car is a bridge between two people and two families. Criollo was presented at the largest Porsche event in the world \u2014 Rennsport Reunion 7, which took place in September 2023 in California.\nThe car now resides in the US and is displayed at the Wunderground Museum in Santa Clarita to showcase its story and craftsmanship.\nSee also\nTardza Project\n",

Rudhall Manor dates from the 14th century, although the house underwent extensive remodelling in each subsequent century and was restored in the 20th. In the Tudor era the manor came into the possession of Herbert Westfaling II, son of the Bishop of Hereford, who married the Rudhall heriess. In the early 19th century, the house was reputedly used as a point of assignation by Lord Nelson and his lover, Emma Hamilton, during their tours of the Wye Valley. In 1830 the manor was bought by Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton of Barings Bank. Later owners included the ornithologist Peter Scott and the businessman John Harvey-Jones. As at May 2024, the manor is for sale.\nArchitecture and description\nPevsner and Brooks describe the complex building history of the manor, which was begun in the 14th century, and developed by William Rudhall in the 16th. Later Georgian and Victorian developments saw the house extended with wings to the south and east. The interior has much wood panelling, some original and some introduced to the house, and decorative wood and stone carving. Above the entrance porch, the Rudhall badge, a Catherine Wheel, is displayed. Rudhall Manor is a Grade I listed building. Unusually, due to its location at the junction of three parishes, it has two Grade I listings, for the house in the Ross parish, and for those parts in the parish of Brampton Abbotts.\nThe grounds include a stream, lakes, and the base of a medieval church cross.\nNotes\n^ The antiquarian Samuel Meyrick purchased a number of items from the house in the 1830 sale, for display at his nearby home, Goodrich Court. These included the menu for a New Year's Eve feast hosted by Westfaling in 1598, at which he offered veal, mutton, beef, pigeon and goose, followed by mince pies.\n^ Catherine of Alexandria, who was martyred on a breaking wheel, had been venerated in nearby Ledbury since the Early Middle Ages.\n",
    "British sprinter (born 1984)\nBernice Wilson (born 21 April 1984) is a former British sprinter who represented her country at the 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships and served two bans from track and field athletics for anti-doping violations.\nAn English Schools 200 metres finalist in 1997, Wilson went on to reach numerous finals at age group, regional and national level before making her big senior break-through by coming second in the 60 metres at the 2010 British Indoor Athletics Championships.\nWilson set a new personal best time of 7.25secs when she finished runner-up to Jodie Williams in the 60 metres at the 2011 British Indoor Athletics Championships in Sheffield on 12 February 2011 leading to her selection for the following month's European Athletics Indoor Championships in Paris, France.\n\nThere she made it through the heats but finished fifth in her semi-final running a time of 7.28 and therefore missing out on a place in the final.\nIn July 2011 it was announced Wilson had been provisionally suspended from competition having failed an anti-doping test after the banned substances anabolic steroid testosterone and Clenbuterol were found in an urine sample she provided at the Bedford International Games on June 12.\n\nThe athlete blamed a contaminated sample but she was subsequently given a four-year ban from athletics.\n\n\nWhile still banned in February 2015, she failed an out-of-competition test for another banned substance, the fertility drug clomiphene, but due to the substantial assistance she provided to UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and a prompt admission of guilt, her second suspension was reduced from 40 months to 10 months.\n\nIt was later revealed that Wilson's coach and then boyfriend, George Skafidas, had been giving her the clomiphene without her knowledge by replacing her vitamin tablets with the drugs.\nIn 2016 Skafidas was given a lifetime ban from athletics after admitting nine anti-doping rule violations.\nWilson is now part of the UKAD Athlete Commission seeking to help others avoid the pitfalls into which she fell.\nSee also\nList of doping cases in sport\nList of doping cases in athletics\n",
    "German opinion journalist (1940\u20132020)\nEkkehard von Braunm\u00fchl born Wilhelm Ekkehard Hans Joachim Mariano von Braunm\u00fchl (29 December 1940, Gleiwitz - 24 June 2020, Wiesbaden) was a German freelance journalist and child rights activist. He is best known as the founder of Antipedagogy, a concept that challenges traditional approaches to education and child-rearing. Braunm\u00fchl's lifelong commitment to advocating for children's rights and challenging conventional educational norms left a lasting impact on the discourse around child-rearing and education. His work encourages us to rethink our approach to nurturing the next generation.\nAntipedagogy\nMain article: Antipedagogy\nBraunm\u00fchl advocated for the abolition of traditional education. He rejected the idea of \u201ctraining\u201d children through strict discipline to conform to adult expectations. Instead, he emphasized respecting the developing personality of the child and treating them as equals. According to Braunm\u00fchl, child-friendly behavior cannot be taught directly; it must be learned through experience. His book, Zeit f\u00fcr Kinder (Time for Children), served as a guidebook for those who wanted to embrace child-friendliness. He considered it a tool in the \u201cantip\u00e4dagogic struggle for freedom\u201d and encouraged people everywhere to advocate for children's well-being and freedom.\nBraunm\u00fchl believed that children should have space for exploration and independent learning rather than being \u201ctrained\u201d or \u201cconditioned\u201d through traditional education methods. In 1970, Braunm\u00fchl co-founded the parents\u2019 association 1. APC Kinderhaus e. V. (1st Antip\u00e4dagogical Club) in Wiesbaden. This association continued the antipedagogic tradition by operating as a child daycare center.\nBraunm\u00fchl's ideas were later adopted by Hubertus von Schoenebeck, albeit with some misunderstandings and distortions. This led to a heated discussion, culminating in the publication of the book, Was ist antip\u00e4dagogische Aufkl\u00e4rung? Mi\u00dfverst\u00e4ndnisse, Mi\u00dfbr\u00e4uche, Mi\u00dferfolge der radikalen Erziehungskritik (What Is Antip\u00e4dagogische Aufkl\u00e4rung? Misunderstandings, Abuses, and Failures of Radical Educational Critique) in 1997. His work aimed to shed light on the misconceptions surrounding antipedagogic ideas and their practical implications.\nPublications\nAntip\u00e4dagogik.

    "Mountain in Arizona, United States\nFor other uses, see Wilson Mountain.\nWilson Mountain is a 7,122-foot-elevation (2,171-meter) summit in Coconino County, Arizona, United States.\nDescription\nWilson Mountain is located three miles north of Sedona in the Red Rock-Secret Mountain Wilderness, on land managed by Coconino National Forest. It is the highest peak in Sedona, and second-highest in the wilderness. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains to Oak Creek which is part of the Verde River watershed. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises over 2,400 feet (732 meters) above Oak Creek Canyon in one mile (1.6\u00a0km). The nearest higher neighbor is East Pocket Knob, 3.73\u00a0miles (6\u00a0km) to the north. Wilson Mountain is composed of light-colored Coconino Sandstone overlaying reddish Schnebly Hill Formation, which is all capped by a layer of dark-gray basalt. Hiking to the top via the Wilson Mountain Trail covers 5.6\u00a0miles (one-way) with 2,300 feet of elevation gain.\nEtymology\nWilson Mountain and Wilson Canyon, which is on the mountain's southern slope, are named after Richard Wilson who was killed by a grizzly bear in the canyon in June 1885. Wilson, a bear hunter, was unable to resist the temptation to shoot the large grizzly with a small rifle he had with him instead of his usual large caliber bear gun, which was being repaired. The bear was only wounded, and attacked Wilson, and his mauled body was found nine days later. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. Landforms officially named in association include Wilson Canyon, Lost Wilson Mountain, and First Bench of Wilson Mountain.\nClimate\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Wilson Mountain is located in a temperate semi-arid climate zone. Hikers can expect afternoon rain and lightning from the seasonal monsoon in late July and August.\nSee also\nList of mountain peaks of Arizona\n\u00a0Mountains portal\nGallery\nWilson Mountain viewed from Munds Mountain\nSSW aspect, from airport\nSouth aspect from Midgely Bridge on Highway 89A\nWest aspect of Wilson Mountain on skyline viewed from Bear Mountain\nNorth aspect of Wilson Mountain to right of center, with Oak Creek Canyon below.\n",
    "American politician\nLady Willie Forbus (August 24, 1892 \u2013 April 27, 1993) was an American politician in the state of Washington. A Democrat, she was a member of the Washington State Senate for the 44th district from 1943 to 1947.\nEarly life and education\nForbus was born on August 24, 1892, in Zieglerville, Mississippi. Her name came from her father's name, William, with, as was customary for daughters named after their fathers, the addition of \"Lady\". Her father was the manager of several cotton plantations and her mother, Birdie, worked as a music teacher and raised cattle and sold eggs, butter and lard with her six children. As the second eldest, Forbus and her older brother Sample were sent to a larger town, Laurel, for their education when Forbus was fourteen as their mother was determined that they receive a good education. 150 miles away from their hometown, Forbus ran the household on the $25 monthly check sent by their parents, even after their four younger siblings joined them in the two-room house.\nForbus's brothers graduated high school with scholarships to university but the same aid was not available to female students, so Forbus attended the University of Mississippi by working as a stenographer for a local judge. When she had an ear infection her junior year, she was unable to be treated at the university infirmary as a female student and was rendered dead in her left ear. She received her bachelor's degree in 1915. Determined to go to law school, she applied to Columbia, Harvard and Yale but was rejected from each, as none were yet admitting female law students. Instead she attended the University of Michigan as the only female student in their class of 1918. After graduation, she was told by the law school dean, \"Goodbye, Lady Willie, someday you'll make a good stenographer for some lawyer\".\nLegal career\nForbus believed her legal career would be best placed if she went west and, using her law school's directory, she sent letters to lawyers in Cheyenne, Denver, San Francisco and Seattle asking for a job. Based on a response from a Seattle-based criminal lawyer, Walter Fulton, Forbus moved to Washington in 1918. She was prohibited by state law from practicing in the state prior to spending a year as a law clerk, as she had not graduated from the University of Washington. She opened her own legal practice the following year. Female lawyers were a rarity in Seattle but Forbus would later state that she was treated well and the state was \"freer, more open-minded\".\nIn 1922, Forbus began to receive public attention due to her handling of the murder of the police officer Charles O. Legate. He was found dead in his car in his garage on March 17 and the gunshot wound to his head led the coroner's jury to rule the death a suicide. His wife retained Forbus as her lawyer, since a death by suicide would mean she was not entitled to his police pension. Forbus brought the case before a grand jury and proved that the gunshots were inflicted by two different bullets and that the garage had been locked from outside. The grand jury overruled the coroner and declared the death a murder, which granted his widow access to the pension.\nForbus campaigned to become prosecuting attorney in 1922, unsuccessfully, but she began to make more speeches and become involved in politics. She testified on behalf of a child labor amendment being debated by the Washington State Legislature and supported an illegitimacy law, retirement benefits for educators and a state department of education. As lawyers could not advertise their practices at the time, these activities raised her profile in the community. In 1932 and 1934, Forbus ran twice to be elected to the King County Superior Court. She ran on a platform \"that all laws should be construed liberally to meet the demands of the people who enact them and the purposes the law seeks to serve\" and supported establishing one court to handle all family matters, including divorce, custody, adoption and paternity. Although she received the backing of women's groups, Forbus was determined to campaign on the basis of her legal career and humanity, not her gender; in one campaign speech, she said, \"the highest qualifications of a judge are human kindliness and common sense in administration of justice. A woman, by nature and a mother, by experience and human contact, is especially fitted for the judiciary; for she brings to the bench not only legal knowledge but human understanding\". She was considered a controversial candidate at the time and lost both elections, although the was the first female candidate in King County.\nDespite her defeats for public office, Forbus continued to advocate for social programs and she became well known in Seattle and surrounding towns. She joined the Democratic Party and began working with the Women's Legislative Council to promote passage of the Twentieth Amendment and the Child Labor Amendment. Forbus participated in the 1936 Roosevelt Caravan, giving s",
    "Lithuanian military officer (1898\u20131979)\nKazys Ali\u0161auskas (29 March 1898 \u2013 16 January 1979) was a Lithuanian military officer and historian.\nBiography\nEarly life military career\nKazys Ali\u0161auskas was born on 29 March 1898 in the village of Me\u0161ku\u010diai in Congress Poland of the Russian Empire. He graduated from the local Marijampol\u0117 Gymnasium. When the Lithuanian Wars of Independence broke out, Ali\u0161auskas joined the Lithuanian army as a volunteer in 1919, graduating from the War School of Kaunas on 6 July 1919. After receiving the rank of kar\u016b\u017eas (the lowest officer rank; replaced later by Lieutenant), Ali\u0161auskas was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Regiment. He fought against the Red Army, Bermontian, and Polish forces. For courage displayed while fighting the Bermontians, he was awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis, 1st degree. On 3 April 1923 he was promoted to Senior Lieutenant. After completing the Higher Officers' Courses in 1926, Ali\u0161auskas was promoted to captain.\nFirst publications\nThe Lithuanian Society for Military Sciences, which was established in 1923, acted as a good intellectual environment for Ali\u0161auskas to publish his first historical texts and to chronicle the history of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. He published two reviews outlining the basic facts of the creation of the regiment. In 1928 he published a review on the Battle of Giedrai\u010diai, a battle in which the regiment fought, and which became one of the most commemorated battles in interwar Lithuania. Stasys Ra\u0161tikis notes that Ali\u0161auskas assisted Kazys Ladiga in writing the official history of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, although the work was not realized in interwar Lithuania. He also graduated from the Vytautas Magnus University Faculty of Law. In 1933 he graduated from the Higher Officers' Courses signal unit, and a year later graduated from machine gun courses. On 23 November 1934 he was promoted to Mayor. On 23 November 1939, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.\nImmigration and career in the United States\nAfter the start of the Second World War, Ali\u0161auskas stayed in Lithuania. After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Ali\u0161auskas was appointed the commandant of the Raseiniai district, later serving as the officer of special affairs for the General Staff of the Lithuanian army. On 11 September 1940 Ali\u0161auskas began his service in the Red Army's Military School of Vilnius. In 1944 he and his family moved to Germany. From 1949 they lived in Chicago. Throughout his publishing career, Ali\u0161auskas worked full-time at a factory during his stay in the United States. In the United States, Ali\u0161auskas was part of the Ramov\u0117 group, a Lithuanian veterans' organization established in 1950 in Chicago. Ali\u0161auskas had prepared a historical overview of the Soviet occupation of Moscow, which the Kersten Committee had deemed as a crime committed by the Soviet Union in the context of international law in 1953. Ali\u0161auskas's overview became the basis for a similar type of document prepared by the committee. As an \u00e9migr\u00e9, Ali\u0161auskas worked on the Lithuanian Boston Encyclopedia's warfare chapter and wrote a book about the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, the latter being commissioned by Ramov\u0117 to be done by 1968 by a group of veteran officers. However, internal disagreements and deaths within the group prevented any significant progress on the book, with Ali\u0161auskas being the only one who completed a part of the planned book earlier than the deadline and who focused on other fronts while other officers focused exclusively on battles with the Polish. Ali\u0161auskas published the book without permission from Ramov\u0117, which got him into conflict with the group that was later resolved. In 1959 Ali\u0161auskas received an award as the best author of the magazine Karys. From 1959 to 1972 Ali\u0161auskas wrote numerous articles about Lithuanian engagements with the Bermontians, Poles and Bolsheviks. In 1971 he also published an article on the Lithuania National Battalion in Siberia in 1917.\nAli\u0161auskas died on 16 January 1979 in Chicago.\nAwards\nAli\u0161auskas received the following awards:\nOrder of the Cross of Vytis, 1st degree (1920)\nOrder of the Grand Duke Gediminas, 4th degree (1928)\nMedal of Lithuanian Independence (1928)\nLatvian War of Independence 10 Year Anniversary Commemorative Medal (1929)\nBibliography\n2\u2011as p\u0117stinink\u0173 Did\u017eiojo Lietuvos kunigaik\u0161\u010dio Algirdo pulkas kautyn\u0117se ties Giedrai\u010diais , (1928)\nPirmieji nepriklausomyb\u0117s kov\u0173 \u017eygiai , (1939)\nKovos d\u0117l Lietuvos nepriklausomyb\u0117s, 1918\u20131920 , (Vol I; 1972)\n",

Reviewers generally praised the game's visual presentation and design as evocative of PS1 horror games. Zoey Handley of Destructoid commended the \"detailed\" pre-rendered environments and \"clever lighting\" to replicate the \"awkward 3D of the era\". However, Leon Hurley of GamesRadar critiqued the player character's \"blocky toy shape\" and \"cartoonish\" enemies. Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun highlighted the game's \"fantastic\" and \"sinister\" setting. Wes Fenlon of PC Gamer highlighted the game's effective jump scares and variety of \"demented monster designs\".\nCritics praised the game's narrative and writing. Sarah Maria Griffin of The Guardian described the game's narrative as complete and richer than anticipated, highlighting the \"levity and playfulness\" of the game's tone and \"bold\" ending. Similarly, Wes Fenlon of PC Gamer praised the \"wry\" writing for its \"cheeky nods to game and horror tropes\". Leon Hurley of GamesRadar noted the \"rewarding\" and \"refreshingly unfamiliar\" story and commended its \"feeling of surprise and uncertainty\". Zoey Handley of Destructoid praised the game's narrative twists and satisfying conclusion, although finding it lacked more distinctive psychological themes.\nReviewers expressed mixed views on the implementation of puzzles and gameplay mechanics. Leon Hurley of GamesRadar considered the game's puzzles to be effective as they were self-contained and balanced in difficulty, although found themselves stuck with some puzzles. Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun praised the design of the puzzles in relying on player observation and intuition, but expressed that the game's combat and survival horror aspects lacked a sense of threat and were easy to manage. Describing the game as \"too easy\", Wes Fenlon of PC Gamer felt the game's combat was simple and did not view the puzzles as memorable. Willa Rowe of Kotaku considered that the enemies, resource management combat felt \"lackluster\" and \"unimportant\", and critiqued the \"inconsistent\" design of simple and in-depth puzzles.\n",

    "Binary pair of distant galaxies in Canes Venatici constellation\nNGC 5098 are a binary pair of distant galaxies located in Canes Venatici constellation. They are made up of one Type E elliptical galaxy, PGC 46529 or NGC 5098 NED01 located east and one Type ES-0 lenticular galaxy, PGC 46515 or NGC 5098 NED02 located west. Both galaxies are located 559 million light-years away from the Solar System and were discovered on April 29, 1827, by John Herschel.\nCharacteristics\nNGC 5098 belongs to the NGC 5098 galaxy group which is located some 560 million light-years away. They are the central galaxy pair, first identified by Ramella et al. 1995 \"their group 80.\"  NGC 5098 NED01 is the brighter and larger of the two, showing optical magnitudes of MB = \u221221.131 and MV = \u221222.097, as compared to MB = \u221220.845 and MV = \u221221.770 for NGC 5098 NED02, which the magnitudes were calculated from Sloan Digital Sky Survey by Adelman-McCarthy and converted to Johnson filter system via the relations provided by Smith et al.\nNGC 5098 NED01 hosts an extended radio source, B2 1317+33 which was detected at several frequencies. A study showed there is evidence of gas swooshing and active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating up which the most likely contributor is the nearby galaxy, NGC 5098 NED02 which is being stripped of its gaseous atmosphere. Significant cavities are present in the central region, which two distinctive bubbles are located north and northeast. They are similar to X-ray observations of other galaxies, groups and clusters. These are formed when active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets push into local ICM, evacuating cavities and creating bright rims of X-ray emission from displaced gas.\nA plume of emission is seen extending northeast from NGC 5098 NED01, exhibiting a spiral arm morphology which originates east from the galaxy and wrapping around to the north. This presence of a feature indicates NGC 5098 NED01 is indeed interacting with NGC 5098 NED02.\nApart from that, there is a sharp surface brightness to west, southwest and south, which is approximately 28 kpc from the central AGN of NGC 5098 NED01. It appears to go eastwards and define the outer boundaries of the arm, adding to the overall impression of the spiral pattern in diffuse emission. The edges are quite similar to features that are seen from cold fronts generated by gas sloshing in observations and stimulations of galaxy clusters and groups.\nA study shows NGC 5098 NED02, does not show any traces of associate emission in X-rays, implying it was stripped of gas. It is possible NGC 5098 NED02 after being ram-pressured stripped and passing east of NGC 5098 NED01 might have circled around it and now moving east, creating a conical wake in diffuse emission.\n",
    "Art Deco NRHP building in Indianapolis, Indiana\nUnited States historic place\nCircle Tower is a 14-story high rise at 55 Monument Circle in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. The building is a contributing property of the Washington Street\u2013Monument Circle Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.\nThe building was designed by Rubush & Hunter and is an example of Art Deco architecture. The building features ziggurat-like upper floors to circumvent a 108\u00a0ft (33\u00a0m) height restriction which was set by the city planners. Another design element is the use of Egyptian motifs and artwork.  \nPlanning\nThe Tower Realty Company was approved to build on the site in 1929. By May 1929 the site was cleared by razing buildings which included the State Savings and Trust and the Franklin buildings. There was also the four-story building of the Starr Piano Company on the site which had to be purchased and razed. The piano store's 99-year lease also had to be purchased by the Tower Realty Company.\nThe Circle Tower building construction, including the 99 year lease of the piano company, was $1.7 million (equivalent to $30,165,116 in 2023). The Indianapolis Star reported that the lobby and walls would feature imported marble, carved granite, limestone and bronze, and that automatic elevators would be installed. The architects announced that their design would be a nine-story building with five additional stories erected on the set-back principle of construction. By October 3, 1929, most of the structure's exterior had been built.\nHistory\nCircle Tower was completed in 1930 and is located on Monument Circle. It is in the style of Art Deco architecture. The building has 111,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (10,300\u00a0m2) of floorspace and features an Egyptian motif with other design details that include an ornate lobby. In 1997, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contribution property of the Washington Street\u2013Monument Circle Historic District.\nThe Chicago co-working company Expansive purchased the building from Ambrose Property Group for $11.65 million in 2017. The buyer intended to renovate parts of the building for co-working space. In 2023, Expansive was sued by Centier Bank of Merrillville, Indiana, for non-payment and bankruptcy proceeding began.\nDesign\nThe building was designed by Rubush & Hunter. The elevators in the building are adorned with an art-deco motif featuring a black-and-gold color scheme with various carvings. King Tut's tomb had been discovered in 1922 and The Indianapolis Star newspaper stated that there was a \"nationwide obsession with all things Egyptian\". The newspaper stated that the tomb's discovery was the reason for the Egyptian motifs which appear in the design elements of the building. There are granite sculptures in the arched entryway and Indianapolis sculptor Joseph Willenborg created a bronze grill with Egyptian figures.\nThe highest stories of the building are ziggurat-like, tapering back from the lower stories. A 1922 city ordinance limited buildings on the Circle to a height of no more than 108\u00a0ft (33\u00a0m). Rubush and Hunter were able to incorporate the set-back upper levels to make the building taller.\nGallery\nPhotochrom of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument ca. 1904 before Circle Tower\nMonument Circle, with Circle Tower on the left (2014)\nCircle Tower (2012)\nCircle Tower Egyptian design elements\nSee also\nList of Art Deco architecture in Indiana\n",

    "Spanish athletic coach (1931\u20132009)\nCarlos Gil P\u00e9rez (28 January 1931 \u2013 25 December 2009) was a Spanish athletics coach. From 1979 to 1988, he was Spain's top national coach, serving as the technical director of the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA). He has been called one of the \"fathers of Spanish athletics\".\nLife\nP\u00e9rez was born in Santiago de Compostela, Spain on 28 January 1931. From 1979 to 1988, he held the position of technical director of the Royal Spanish Athletics Federation (RFEA). Under his leadership, Spanish athletics achieved its first Olympic medals at the Moscow Olympics in 1980 and in Los Angeles in 1984.\nAt the 1982 European Athletics Indoor Championships in Athens, Spain achieved one of its great milestones by winning five medals. Three years later, in Budapest, Spain rose to the highest category of continental athletics.\nP\u00e9rez also made significant contributions in sports administration. Within the RFEA, he revamped the technical infrastructure by introducing experienced coaches, thereby fostering sport development. Additionally, he played a pivotal role in initiating athlete support programs, including the creation of ADO scholarships. These scholarships provided financial assistance, offering 80,000 pesetas over four years to athletes with the potential to excel in Olympic Games and top-level championships.\nReturning to his hometown, Perez coached the first Salamanca-born national champion in any sport in 1958; under his guidance, Jos\u00e9 Luis Albarr\u00e1n claimed the title of Spanish champion in the 200 meters at the old Anoeta Stadium in San Sebasti\u00e1n.\nIn Salamanca, he trained dozens of athletes under his guidance from 1955 to 2009, with notable mentions including his five Olympic athletes: Jos\u00e9 Luis Albarr\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Para\u00edso, Rosa Colorado, Antonio S\u00e1nchez, and Frutos Feo. They also achieved numerous Spanish records.\nIn 1968, he received a Silver Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit in Salamanca from Juan Antonio Samaranch. In 2007, he received the Silver Medal again from King Juan Carlos I. In 2010, he received the Gold Medal posthumously.\nP\u00e9rez was frequently seen at the Helm\u00e1ntico Stadium in Salamanca, coaching athletes even at over 70 years old. In his later years, he worked with athletes like Adri\u00e1n Ingelmo, \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda, Saturnino Gonz\u00e1lez, David Berrocal, Pedro Ceballos, and Elvis Gonz\u00e1lez, among others.\nPerez died on 25 December 2009 in Salamanca.\nSexual misconduct allegations\nOn 7 May 2024, a 57-year-old former discus thrower, under a pseudonym, claimed that P\u00e9rez sexually abused him when he was 17 years old. Three other people came forth with similar allegations published in the newspaper El Pa\u00eds.\nWorks\n\u2014 (1974). Union Deportiva Salamanca: 1923-1974  (in Spanish).

    "Lifeboat station in Scotland\nStromness Lifeboat Station is located in the harbour town of Stromness, the second largest town of Mainland, Orkney, in the isles of Orkney, Scotland.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1867.\nSince 1998, the station has operated a Severn-class All-weather lifeboat, 17-16 Violet, Dorothy and Kathleen (ON 1236).\nHistory\nOn 1 January 1866, the Albion was wrecked on Graemsay, one of the Orkney Islands island. Fortunately 90 people survived, but 10 lives were lost. Following this event, a request was made to the RNLI to open a lifeboat station in the area, and after a visit by their Inspector of Lifeboats, this was agreed. At the time, Stromness would be the most northerly of all the RNLI stations.\nA boathouse was constructed at The Ness by Robertson & Smith, costing \u00a3144-19s-6d,  An order for a 33-foot 10-oared self-righting lifeboat at \u00a3280 was placed with Forrestt of Limehouse, London, and a launch-carriage cost a further \u00a398-10s-0d. Transported to Stromness free of charge by the 'Aberdeen Steam Navigation company', and 'Edinburgh, Leith and Clyde Shipping company'. The boat arrived in Stromness in the summer of 1867. The lifeboat was provided out of a gift from Bradford manufacturer and philanthropist Titus Salt, and was duly named Saltaire after his model village near Shipley in Yorkshire.\nThe Ness and former lifeboat house\nAn RNLI inspection in 1890 proved that The Ness was a difficult location to launch the boat. At a practice launch into a gale, it took over an hour to get the boat afloat. Whilst conditions still weren't perfect at Stromness, it was recommended that the boat be relocated to Stromness harbour and remain afloat. A new 42-foot 12-oared Self-righting lifeboat was ordered from McAlister of Dumbarton, funded by the Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds (Ashton Order) Friendly Society, and named Good Shepherd at a ceremony in Greenock on 16 May 1891. The boat arrived in Stromness on 15 June 1891.\nWork began in 1900 on the construction of a new boathouse with roller slipway at Stromness harbour. Costing \u00a31250, the boathouse was completed in 1902.\nRNLI trials of motor-powered lifeboats began in the early 1900s, using modified Pulling and Sailing lifeboats (lifeboats with oars and sails). In 1907, the RNLI placed an order with Thames Ironworks for four new purpose-built motor-powered lifeboats. The first of these was the \u00a32,995 42-foot self-righting John A. Hay (ON 591), with a 30\u00a0hp petrol engine, providing 6.5 knots, funded from the legacy of Mr John Alexander Hay of Cheltenham. Setting out from London Docks on 15 April 1909, along with a similar boat for Stromsay, she covered the 768 in 15 days, arriving in Stromness on 30 April.\nOn 15 June 1916, the HMS Hampshire struck a mine off Marwick Head, just 12 north of Stromness, and sank with the loss of 737 lives, including that of Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener. There were only 12 survivors. There is speculation whether it would have made any difference given the conditions, but the lifeboat was never called out.\nStromness 1926 Boathouse and slipway\nMelville, Dundas and Whitsun, of Glasgow started construction of a replacement boathouse and roller-slipway in 1925, on the site of the previous boathouse. Costing \u00a310,660, it was completed in 1926. However, when a new lifeboat was due for Stromness two years later, it was proposed that they receive a 60-foot Barnett-class lifeboat, which would need to be kept afloat due to the size.\nHonorary Secretary at Stromness, Mr George Thompson, travelled to London to meet RNLI 'Naval Architect' James Rennie Barnett, and the result was the 51-foot Barnett (Stromness-class) lifeboat, suitable for slipway launches from a boathouse. As it turned out, the new Stromness lifeboat, J.J.K.S.W. (ON 702), would be the only one housed.\nStromness Lifeboat performed an exceptional service in 1930, but without a good outcome. On 28 March 1930, in gale conditions, the Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran was wrecked on Ve Skerries, near Papa Stour, on the west side of Shetland. Despite recent moves to locate a lifeboat in Lerwick, there were no lifeboats based in Shetland. After all other rescue attempts failed, the Stromness lifeboat, being the nearest, was launched at 4:30pm on 30 March. In very poor conditions, the lifeboat first sailed to Scalloway as a staging point for food and a refuel, arriving at 7:30 am on the 31 March, before heading around Shetland with a local Pilot, to Ve Skerries. All that was found was the wreck, and no survivors. The lifeboat headed back to Scalloway, before commencing the 16\u00bd hour journey back to Stromness, arrriving at 11:00pm on 1 April. J.J.K.S.W. (ON 702) had been away for 55 hours, and travelled 320 miles.\nIn 1998, Stromness received their latest lifeboat. A Severn-class lifeboat, the largest type of the RNLI fleet, fitted with twin Caterpillar 3412 1200\u00a0bhp marine diesel engines, providing a ",
    "Iranian historical and military figure\nAli Akbar Derakhshani  (Persian: \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u200c\u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631 \u062f\u0631\u062e\u0634\u0627\u0646\u06cc; February 28, 1896 \u2013  March 27, 1978) was one of the founders of the New Iranian Army. He began his military service during the reign of Ahmad Shah Qajar.\nBackground\nAli Akbar was born on February 28, 1896, in Tehran. His family was Azerbaijani and Shiite. His father, Ali Naqi Khan Kangerlu (son of Khan Mohammad Khan), was among the first Iranian officers of the Persian Cossack Brigade. He was born in 1863 in the village of Khaneqah Sorkh near Urmia, and he passed away in Tehran in 1903, where he was buried in Imamzadeh Masoom fa. Ali Akbar's grandfather, Reza Qolikhan, migrated from the Nakhchivan region to the south of the Aras River in 1828, following the Turkmancha treaty between the governments of Iran and Russia. Many people and tribal leaders unwilling to accept Russian citizenship did the same. Ali Akbar attended high school at the Cossack Brigade military school in Tehran. At the age of 18, he entered the Gendarmerie officer school and was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. During his service in the gendarmerie, he was assigned to the 6th regiment of Lorestan. After participating in intense fighting to ensure regional order, he was reassigned to Isfahan with the 6th regiment. Later, he joined the National Defense Committee with this regiment in Sultanabad. He participated in the Bid Sorkh (Red Willow) pass battle between the Iranian forces and the Tsarist Russian army and was awarded medals for bravery in battle.\n\nCossack Brigade and Uniformed Troops: Gilan Wars\nIn 1918, he resigned from the Gendarmerie and joined the Cossack army with the rank of second lieutenant. He served in the Cossack Atriyad in Rasht. Displaying great bravery in the wars with Mirza Kuchik Khan, he quickly rose through the ranks, reaching the rank of colonel within five years. At the age of 26 he was appointed as the commander of the Gilan brigade, one of the largest units in Iran's army. During this time, he was directly involved in fierce battles between the Iranian military and the Russian Bolshevik forces, who had invaded Gilan and occupied various areas, including the cities of Rasht, Bandar Anzali, and Astara. Afterward, he became the head of the Mazandaran military. His diary detailing the Gilan wars serves as a valuable source for historians. In these notes, General Derakhshani clearly wrote that while the people of Gilan fully supported Mirza Kuchik Khan against the government forces, they sincerely supported the soldiers of the Iranian government in the war with the Bolsheviks.\nUrmia: Command of the Sepahban Regiment and Forces of Three Provinces\nOn October 21, 1933, Ali Akbar Derakhshani was appointed as the commander of the newly established Sepahban regiment in his father's hometown, Urmia. This regiment had the crucial task of safeguarding the northwestern border areas of the country. Shortly after, he was entrusted with the command of the forces of three provinces - Urumieh, Khoy, and Salmas, which included the Layamout (Deathless) Cavalry Regiment. This marked the beginning of his extensive missions in the western regions of Iran.\n\nThe people of Urmia and its surroundings had endured many hardships due to foreign occupation, prolonged bloody clashes among nomadic groups and sectarian conflicts, which resulted in murder, plunder, and insecurity. The city and its neighboring villages were left in semi-ruinous conditions. Two infantry companies and a machine gun company of the Sepahban regiment were housed in dilapidated buildings without basic amenities like toilets, forcing soldiers to relieve themselves in nearby alleys. Derakhshani worked tirelessly to address various shortcomings. Additionally, since other government offices were not fully established yet, he also focused on improving the living conditions of the people.\nWithin a few months, conditions for the residents began to improve. However, the soldiers' living conditions remained dire, with irregular and delayed delivery of salaries, rations, and clothing. The government lacked the funds to build barracks, leaving only the remnants of Russian barracks which locals had scavenged to repair their own homes. Derakhshani, with the cooperation of local commissions and support from residents, embarked on rebuilding a new barracks on the ruins, with Ayatollah Arab Baghi, the religious authority of West Azerbaijan, encouraged the reconstruction effort. Without central government funding, Derakhshani mobilized residents to construct a thirty-meter avenue followed by additional squares and streets.\nHis other initiatives included establishing a telephone line between Urmia, Salmas, and Khoy, utilizing leftover wires from the Russian army, and recruiting builders and carpenters from Tabriz to expedite city reconstruction efforts.\n\nCampaign in the West\nOn November 5, 1924, Ali Akbar Derakhshani was appointed to lead the advance forces, composed of the Sepahban regiment a",
    "Chinese musician and educator\nZhao Manqin (Chinese: \u8d75\u66fc\u7434; born in 1953) is a Chinese musician and educator. He is a member of the Chinese Musician's Association, Director of the Chinese National Orchestra Society, Visiting professor at the China Conservatory of Music.\nZhao Manqin developed the kuaisu zhixu (Fast Finger Sequence Technique System) which drew on the playing techniques of piano, violin, and pipa.\nBiography\nZhao Manqin was born in 1953 in the Xinye County of Henan Province, China. He started writing and publishing music at the age of 16. Zhao Manqin attended the Xinye County Middle School in 1965 and continued his education at the Seaman School in Xinye County in 1962. He later attended the Xinye County Middle School. Due to his father's persecution during the Cultural Revolution, Zhao was sent to perform agricultural work in the countryside in 1966. Despite this, he continued his involvement in music and joined various performance groups, including the Xinye County Cultural Troupe in 1972.\nIn 1972, he developed the kuaisu zhixu  (Fast Finger Sequence Technique System), which drew on the piano, violin, and pipa playing techniques. This system is widely used by the Guzheng industry in China.\nIn 1978, his fast-fingering composition, \"The Sun is Shining Red on Jinggang Mountain\", was included in the curriculum of the Central Conservatory of Music.\nFrom 1980, he was invited lecturer at major music conservatories and academies in China and internationally, including the Central Conservatory of Music, Folk Music Department of the Central Conservatory of Music, Xi'an Conservatory of Music, Xinghai Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Normal University Music College, Guangxi Arts College, Kunming Medical University, Eastman School of Music in the United States and the National Australian University in Australia.\nIn the mid-1980s, he began work on Guzheng education and established the Guzheng Art Institute. He subsequently conducted educational courses in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xinzheng, Xingyang, Henan Youtian, Nanyang, and Haikou and provided training to professional and amateur Guzheng teachers across China.\nIn 1986 his work \"Symmetry and Inertia\" was presented at the First National Guzheng Academic Conference along with the performance of the Guzheng piece dahu shangshan (Fighting the tiger in the mountain) by his disciple Wang Zhongshan using the fast fingering he developed which led to the recognition of his technique.\nMany of his students and master class students hold leading positions in various music performance groups and music institutions, including, Wang Zhongshan (Professor at China Conservatory of Music),  Li Meng (Professor at the Central Conservatory of Music), Fan Yifeng (Professor at Xi'an Conservatory of Music), Wang Wei (Professor at Shanghai Conservatory of Music), Luo Xiaoci (Director of Shanghai National Orchestra), Gao Liang (Professor at Shenyang Conservatory of Music), Chen Weimin (Associate professor at Xinghai Conservatory of Music), Zhang Tong (Professor at Harbin Normal University), Sun Zhuo (Professor at Shaanxi Normal University), and Mao Ya (Lecturer at the University of Tokyo in Japan), and others.\nGuzheng performance techniques\nIn 1972, he developed the kuaisu zhixu  (Fast Finger Sequence Technique System) which drew on the playing techniques of piano, violin, and pipa. This system is widely used by the Guzheng industry in China. This system solved the limitation of Guzheng in playing fast passages of heptatonic scale and facilitated the inclusion of the Guzheng to perform with the rest of the traditional instruments in an orchestra setting. This system changed three finger wearing plectra playing in octave symmetry to all eight fingers wearing plectra plucking approach. This change expanded the potential Guzheng fingering sequences, allowing playing fast passages of pentatonic scale, heptatonic scale, and chromatic scale.\nIn 1978, his fast-fingering composition, \"The Sun is Shining Red on Jinggang Mountain\", was included in the curriculum of the Central Conservatory of Music.\nAfter the 1986 presentation of his work \"Symmetry and Inertia\" at the First National Guzheng Academic Conference, along with the performance of the Guzheng piece dahu shangshan (Fighting the tiger in the mountain) by his follower Wang Zhongshan using the fast fingering he developed, his technique gained recognition. This performance contributed to the nationwide spread of Zhao Manqin's fast finger sequence compositions such as \"The Sun is Shining Red on Jinggang Mountain\", \"Climbing the Mountain to Beat the Tiger\", \"Ode of Shan Dan Flower\", \"Evening Party\", and \"Hora Dance\".  It also led to the nationwide implementation of the fast-fingering system into Guzheng practice and performance. Composers subsequently started to compose contemporary repertoires using the fast-fingering sequence techniques, including \"Dance of Yi Tribe\", \"Spring in Xiangjiang River\", \"Eternal Lament",
    "American freethinker (1849\u20131931)\nJames B. Elliott (1849\u20131931) was an American freethinker. Through his involvement with a number of freethinking organizations and publications, he met the anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre, with whom he had a brief romantic relationship and fathered a child, Harry. He spent the 1890s raising his son, working as a carpenter and collecting memorabilia of his idol Thomas Paine. By the turn of the 20th century, he succombed to a mental disorder and became estranged from his family, leaving his son and losing contact with de Cleyre.\nBiography\nJames B. Elliott was born in 1849, in Philadelphia, where he was raised by his mother. He found work as a carpenter and later became a freethinker, giving lectures on rationalism at the Philadelphia Ethical Society and Friendship Liberal League, and writing articles for The Truth Seeker. Through one freethought newspaper, The Progressive Age, Elliott encountered the writings of Voltairine de Cleyre, noting her expressive anger towards the Catholic Church.\nIn June 1888, he greeted de Cleyre at the Philadelphia train station, having invited her to give a speech at a meeting of the Friendship Liberal League. The following year, she settled in the city and moved into Elliott's rooming house. The two were quickly attracted to each other, although historian Margaret Marsh notes that Elliott was \"intellectually inferior\" to de Cleyre and had an \"eccentric\" character, which left her to wonder why de Cleyre found him so appealing. They struck up a brief romantic relationship, but as de Cleyre refused to marry Elliott, it quickly broke down and ended. They remained friends and continued to live in the same house, with Elliott caring for de Cleyre's plants and pets while she was on lecture tours.\nOn June 12, 1890, de Cleyre gave birth to their son Harry, but she felt emotionally and physically unable to raise him, so left him in Elliott's care. De Cleyre's sister Adelaide D. Thayer, herself childless, asked if she could take care of Harry, but Elliott refused. In 1894, de Cleyre moved out of the Elliott household, finding a new home with the couple Mary and George Brown. In 1896, Elliott visited de Cleyre's mother Harriet De Claire and built an extension for her house in St. Johns, Michigan. Around this time, Elliott was made secretary of both the Paine Memorial Association and the Paine Historical Association. Elliott idolised Thomas Paine, going on a pilgrimage to all of Paine's homes in both North America and England and collecting his memorabilia.\nBy the turn of the 20th century, Elliott had become increasingly mentally imbalanced and left his son at the age of ten to fend for himself. In 1900, he managed to find de Cleyre's estranged father Hector De Claire, and together they sent Harriet a number of messages that worried her. For this, de Cleyre called Elliott a \"devil\" and said he was \"not right in his intellects\", telling her sister Adelaide that he had \"no self-respect whatever, but insists on intruding himself constantly everywhere.\"\nIn 1910, de Cleyre moved to Chicago and Elliott fell out of touch with her. After her death, her anarchist comrades claimed that Elliott had deliberately prevented de Cleyre from seeing their child, but Margaret Marsh notes that this depiction is inaccurate. Elliott himself died in 1931, at the age of 82. Elliott was posthumously denounced in anarchist newspapers for neglecting his son Harry and preventing de Cleyre from seeing her child; according to historian Margaret Marsh, this depiction was \"not strictly true, but it preserved an unsullied image\" of de Cleyre.\n",
    "Manor House in Lohja, Finland\nOjamo Manor (Finnish: Ojamon kartano, Swedish: Ojamo herrg\u00e5rd) is a manor house in Lohja in Uusimaa, Finland. The site is known for housing the remains of the oldest iron mine in Finland. The manor house is owned by a private foundation, Vanha Lohja -s\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6.\nHistory\nOjamo Manor is named in the written sources for the first time in 1384. The significance of the manor house grew during the 16th century when iron ore was found from its grounds. The first findings are dated between 1528 and 1540.\nThe Iron Mine\nThe King of Sweden, Gustav Vasa, gave Erik Fleming, the owner of Suitia Manor in Siuntio, a permission to mine iron ore from the grounds of Ojamo Manor in 1542. From Ojamo the iron was transported to Siuntio to be refined in Suitia Ironworks. The iron mine in Ojamo is the oldest known iron mine in Finland. Attempts to mine iron ore from the grounds of Ojamo were done even during the 19th century. However, the mining operations ceased for the last time in 1862.\nThe Main Building\nThe current main building of Ojamo Manor was built using timber in 1850 by lieutenant colonel Dimitri Swertschkoff. Ojamo Manor represents richly decorated Russian empire style. The building has one floor and a centrally positioned tower, which is a later addition. The decorations on the window frames resemble Karelian building style.\nOjamo Manor is surrounded by a park. The southern part of the park has a maple alleyway, which leads to the grave of lieutenant colonel Swertschkoff. Other points of interest in the park area include several large mine openings on the ground, some of which are filled with water.\nList of Owners\nA list of owners of Ojamo Manor from 1540 onwards:\nJohan Larsson 1540\u20131545\nHenrik Johansson 1546\u20131559\nHenrik Johansson's widow Anna 1560\nHans Johansson 1561\u20131596\nHans Johansson's widow Brita 1596\u20131603\nTomas Larsson 1616\u20131619\nSiegfrid 1620\nNils Siegfridsson 1621\u20131624\nSimon Landsberger 1624-1629 (renting from the Crown);\nabandoned 1630\u20131644\nJakob Wolle 1645-1646 (renting from the Crown)\nPeter Thorw\u00f6ste the older and the younger 1647\u20131682\nGabriel Tammelinus, Vicar, 1683\u20131695\nAnna Eriksdotter 1695\u20131713\nBrita Tammelin 1724\u20131731\nHenrik Tammelin, Assessor, 1732\u20131753\nKristina Tammelin 1754\nJohan Gabriel Kihl, Assessor, 1755\u20131760\nJohan Gabriel Kihl's family 1760\u20131762\nJakob Johan Westberg, Supervisor, 176317\u201367\nKarl Segercrantz, Captain, 1768\u20131775\nAnna Stina Carlborg 1776\u20131782\nAdolf Magnus Rotkirch, Captain, 1783\u20131788\nAxel Maximilian Carpelan, Leutnant, 1789\u20131816\nAlbertina Eleonora 1816\u20131836\nAlbertina Eleonora's family 1836\u20131842;\nKarl von Schoultz, Lecturer, 1843\u20131846\nDmitri Swertschkoff, Lieutenant Colonel, 1847\u20131863\nAugusta Karolina Swertschkoff 1863\u20131869\nAugusta Karolina Swertschkoff's family 1869\u20131878\nFanny Swertschkoff 1878\u20131891\nIsidor Swertschkoff, governor, 1891\u20131902\nGustav Henrik Karlsson 1902\u20131922\nAntti Savolainen 1922\u20131968\nUnto and Eero Savolainen 1969\u20131992\nEero Savolainen 1993\u20131997\nFoundation \"Vanha Lohja -s\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6\" 1998-\n",

    "In gas dynamics, the Landau derivative or fundamental derivative of gas dynamics, named after Lev Landau who introduced it in 1942, refers to a dimensionless physical quantity characterizing the curvature of the isentrope drawn on the specific volume versus pressure plane. Specifically, the Landau derivative is a second derivative of specific volume with respect to pressure. The derivative is denoted commonly using the symbol \n\u0393\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma }\n or \n\u03b1\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n and is defined by\n\u0393\n=\nc\n4\n2\n\u03c5\n3\n(\n\u2202\n2\n\u03c5\n\u2202\np\n2\n)\ns\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma ={\\frac {c^{4}}{2\\upsilon ^{3}}}\\left({\\frac {\\partial ^{2}\\upsilon }{\\partial p^{2}}}\\right)_{s}}\nwhere\nAlternate representations of \n\u0393\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma }\n include\n\u0393\n=\n\u03c5\n3\n2\nc\n2\n(\n\u2202\n2\np\n\u2202\n\u03c5\n2\n)\ns\n=\n1\nc\n(\n\u2202\n\u03c1\nc\n\u2202\n\u03c1\n)\ns\n=\n1\n+\nc\n\u03c5\n(\n\u2202\nc\n\u2202\np\n)\ns\n=\n1\n+\nc\n\u03c5\n(\n\u2202\nc\n\u2202\np\n)\nT\n+\nc\nT\n\u03c5\nc\np\n(\n\u2202\n\u03c5\n\u2202\nT\n)\np\n(\n\u2202\nc\n\u2202\nT\n)\np\n.\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma ={\\frac {\\upsilon ^{3}}{2c^{2}}}\\left({\\frac {\\partial ^{2}p}{\\partial \\upsilon ^{2}}}\\right)_{s}={\\frac {1}{c}}\\left({\\frac {\\partial \\rho c}{\\partial \\rho }}\\right)_{s}=1+{\\frac {c}{\\upsilon }}\\left({\\frac {\\partial c}{\\partial p}}\\right)_{s}=1+{\\frac {c}{\\upsilon }}\\left({\\frac {\\partial c}{\\partial p}}\\right)_{T}+{\\frac {cT}{\\upsilon c_{p}}}\\left({\\frac {\\partial \\upsilon }{\\partial T}}\\right)_{p}\\left({\\frac {\\partial c}{\\partial T}}\\right)_{p}.}\nFor most common gases, \n\u0393\n>\n0\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma >0}\n, whereas abnormal substances such as the BZT fluids exhibit \n\u0393\n<\n0\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma <0}\n.

After graduating from high school, from 1962 to 1964, he worked as a laboratory assistant at the Department of Theoretical Physics at the Moscow State Pedagogical University, equipment adjuster at the Moscow Electric Lamp Plant. In 1964 he entered the Moscow Energy Institute, graduating in 1968, and worked as an engineer at the Joint Design Bureau of the same institute.\nSince 1969 he served in the KGB of the USSR. He served in the 8th Main Directorate of the KGB of the USSR (encryption and decryption, it was also responsible for government communications), beginning his service as an engineer. Simultaneously with his service, he received additional education: in 1973 he graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of the Moscow State University and in 1983 graduate school at the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB.\nWhen, after the collapse of the USSR in December 1991, the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information under the President of the Russian Federation (FAPSI) was separated from the KGB, among other intelligence services, Matyukhin joined FAPSI and was appointed head of the Research Center of the Main Security Directorate FAPSI communications. From 1993 he served as Deputy General Director of FAPSI.\nOn May 31, 1999, by decree of the President of the Russian Federation Yeltsin, he was appointed General Director of FAPSI. Colonel General V. G. Matyukhin became the third and last head of FAPSI.\nSince January 2001, as Director General of FAPSI, he was a member of the Operational Headquarters for managing counter-terrorism actions in the North Caucasus region, created by decree of the President of the Russian Federation. He was a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation (from June 14, 1999, to June 21, 2003). Since June 13, 2000, member of the Russian Government Commission on Military-Industrial Issues. Since November 2000 - Chairman of the Coordination Council for ensuring the security of encryption tools and their operation in government and closed communications systems of the CIS member states.\nOn March 11, 2003, President of the Russian Federation Putin signed a number of decrees aimed at reforming government bodies in Russia. In particular, FAPSI was abolished, its functions were distributed between the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation and the Federal Protective Service of the Russian Federation. At the same day, Vladimir Matyukhin was appointed chairman of the State Committee of the Russian Federation for State Defense Orders under the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation. On the same day, March 11, 2003, by decree No. 305 of the President of Russia, Matyukhin was awarded the military rank of army general.\nIn April 2004, the State Committee for Defense Orders was transformed into the Federal Service for Defence Contracts of the Russian Federation under the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. However, Matyukhin was not placed at the head of the new service, but was appointed First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation. He worked in this position for less than a month and was discharged from military service in May 2004.\nSince June 8, 2004 to 2010 he served as Director of the Federal Agency for Information Technologies of the Russian Federation (Rosinformtekhnologii). On January 26, 2010, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a governmental decree releasing Matyukhin from his post \u201cdue to reaching the age limit\u201d for holding it.\nSince December 16, 2010, he has been First Deputy General Director and Scientific Director of the Research and Design Institute of Information, Automation and Communications in Railway Transport (JSC NIIAS).\nHe is Doctor of Technical Sciences, a full member of the Russian Academy of Cryptography, the Russian Academy of Engineering Sciences and the International Academy of Communications. Laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation. For his great contribution to the development of information technology and the implementation of state policy in the field of informatization, he was awarded a Certificate of Honor from the Government of the Russian Federation, and received letters of gratitude from the President of the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Russian Federation. Author of more than 150 scientific papers and four inventions. Married and has a son.\n",
    "English headmaster and poet\nAlexander Gil the younger, also spelled Gill, (1597\u20131642) was an English headmaster and poet. He was the high-master of St. Paul's School.\nBiography\nGil was the son of Alexander Gill the elder. He was born, probably at Norwich, in 1597. He obtained a scholarship at St. Paul's School, London, of which his father became highmaster in 1608. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, 26 June 1612; became an exhibitioner of Wadham College in 1612, and bible-clerk there 20 April 1613; proceeded B.A. 1616, and M.A. 1619. He afterwards returned to Trinity, where he took the degrees of B.D. (27 June 1627) and D.D. (9 March 1636\u20137) (Oxf. Univ. Reg., Oxford Hist. Soc. II. ii. 326, iii. 344). Gill was of very unruly disposition, and was, according to the pamphleteers of the day, on bad terms with the university authorities; but he displayed much skill as a writer of Latin and Greek verse. As early as 1612 he published a Latin threnody on the death of Prince Henry. At Michaelmas 1621 he was appointed under-usher of St. Paul's School. John Milton was among his pupils; a close intimacy sprang up between them, and many of Milton's Latin letters to Gill are preserved. On 20 May 1628 the poet writes in extravagant terms of Gill's Latin verses. On 2 July following he sent Gill some of his own Latin verses for him to criticise and correct. On 4 December 1634 Milton again thanks Gill for a gift of Latin verses. Meanwhile, Gill had fallen into serious trouble, and lost his post at St. Paul's School. He was visiting his friends at Trinity College, Oxford, about Michaelmas 1628, when he drank a health to John Felton, Buckingham's assassin, and made some disrespectful remarks about the king. William Chillingworth, with whom, according to Aubrey, Gill was in the habit of corresponding, was of this party, and deemed it fitting to inform William Laud of what had passed. Gill was committed to the Gatehouse at Westminster (4 September) by Laud's orders, and was examined in the Star-chamber by Laud and Attorney-general Heath on 6 September. Laud's report of the proceedings sent to the king appears in his correspondence (Anglo-Cath. Libr. vii. 16\u201318). A search at Oxford in the rooms of William Pickering of Trinity College, an intimate friend of Gill, disclosed letters and verses by him (some dated in 1626), abusing Buckingham and Charles I. Gill admitted his guilt, and was sentenced (1 November) to degradation from the ministry, to a fine of 2,000l., and to the loss of both ears (one to be removed at Oxford, and the other in London). Gill's father immediately petitioned for a remission of the sentence, and Edward, earl of Dorset, supported the appeal (Aubrey). Laud, a friend of the elder Gill, consented to mitigate the fine, and to forego the corporal punishment. On 30 November 1630 a free pardon was signed by Charles I. Gill, now dismissed from his ushership, received small gratuities from the governors of St. Paul's School in 1631, 1633, and 1634. He tried to retrieve his reputation by publishing in 1632 a little volume of collected Latin verse, entitled \u2018Parerga sive Poetici Conatus,\u2019 containing a fulsome dedication to the king and a profoundly respectful poem to Laud, dated 1 January 1631\u20132, besides much verse to other royal or noble personages, and odes on the successes of Gustavus Adolphus in Germany.\nAccording to Anthony Wood, Gill obtained temporary employment at the school of Thomas Farnaby in Cripplegate. On 18 November 1635, the day following his father's death, he was elected his father's successor in the high-mastership of St. Paul's School. In 1639 complaints were made of his excessive severity towards a boy named Bennett, and at the end of the year he was dismissed. In the school accounts there is an entry of 13l. 7s. 11d. as \u2018charges for displacing Dr. Gill,\u2019 which implies some resistance on his part. On 28 January 1639 Gill appealed to the king to reverse the decision on the ground that it was based on \u2018the unjust complaint of a lying, thieving boy\u2019 (Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1639\u201340, p.\u00a0389). The king referred the petition to Archbishop Laud and \u2018some other lords.\u2019 The Mercers' Company, the governing body of the school, insisted on their right to deal with Gill as they pleased. Laud argued that Gill could not be removed, according to canon law, without his ordinary's knowledge (Laud, Works, iv. 80\u20131). But the company gained the day, and Laud's remarks about the canon law formed the subject of the tenth charge brought against him at his trial. Two coarse doggerel poems, headed respectively \u2018On Doctor Gill, master of St. Paul's School,\u2019 and \u2018Gill upon Gill \u2026 uncas'd, unstript, and unbound,\u2019 dwelt on Gill's whipping propensities and savage temper. They were first issued with the \u2018Loves of Hero and Leander,\u2019 London, 1651, and reappear in \u2018The Rump,\u2019 1660. Aubrey writes that Dr. Gill had \u2018his moods and humours as particularly his whipping fits.\u2019 During his last year at the school Gill was refused ",

    "Kingdom in central India\nThe Kingdom of Malwa was a monarchy in central India that was established by Jayavarman of the House of Aulikara in 350 AD. It was ruled by multiple royal houses discontinuously until it was finally conquered in 1562 by Akbar the Great, the Shahenshah of Hindustan, and annexed as the Malwa Province.\nThe Kingdom of Avanti of ancient India had been based in the region where the Kingdom of Malwa later came up. The Kingdom of Avanti was conquered by Indo-Scythia in 61 BC. Following this, the region was ruled by the Malava republic. During the period, the region's name gradually changed to Malava or Malwa. In 350 AD, Jayavarman established the Kingdom of Malwa in region and founded the House of Aulikara. Yashodharman, the King of Malwa between 515 and 545 AD significantly expanded the kingdom and conquered the territories of Huns. Following his death, Krishnaraja became the King of Malwa and founded the House of Kalachuri in 550 AD.\nThe Kingdom of Malwa was conquered and ruled by Harsha, the Emperor of Kannauj between 625 and 647 AD after which regained it's independence until being conquered by the Gurjara Empire in 755 AD. Hereafter it formed a part of the Gurjara Empire until it regained its independence in 948 under the House of Paramara until it was conquered by the Delhi Sultanate in 1305. In 1402, the governor of Malwa declared his independence and established the Sultanate of Malwa under the House of Khalji which reigned till its conquest by Akbar, the Shahenshah of Hindustan in 1562.\nHistory\nHouse of Aulikara (350\u2013530)\nThe region where the Kingdom of Malwa was established had earlier been part of the Malava republic. The Malavas had been a tribe from northwestern India who conquered and established their rule over the Malwa region sometime after the fall of the Kingdom of Avanti (61 BC). They formed an oligarchic republic and maintained their rule over Malwa until 350 AD. Jayavarman, a Malava chief, deposed the republican government and established the Kingdom of Malwa and the House of Aulikara. Taking advantage of the confusion created during the reign of Rudrasena III, the Saka Satrap of Gujarat for thirteen years, from 351 to 364 AD, Jayavarman seized the territory near Mandsor from the Sakas. In 423 AD, Viswavarman accepted the suzerainty of Kumaragupta I, the Emperor of Magadha. In 467 AD, following the succession crisis after the death of Emperor Skandagupta of Magadha, Prabhakara became an independent monarch.\nFurther north, the First Hunnic War began in 496 between the Hunnic Empire and the Magadha Empire and the Huns conquered parts of Central and Northwest India by 510. However, in 515 during the reign of Yashodharman, the Kingdom of Malwa joined the War in aid of Magadha and managed to defeat the Huns. The Hunnic King Toramana died from war injuries after a battle with the Magadhan Emperor Narasimhagupta.\nIn 520, the Second Hunnic War began after the son of Tomara, Mihirakula, King of the Huns invaded the Magadhan Empire once more and occupied and sacked Patliputra, the Magadhan capital. Following this, Malwa formed an alliance with the Kingdom of Thanesar and in 528, defeated the Hunnic Empire.\nHouse of Kalachuri (530\u2013625)\nIn 530 AD, Yashodharman died without any heirs. Seeing this Krishnaraja seized power and became the King of Malwa and established the House of Kalachuri. His son, Shankaragana (r. 575\u2013600) conquered parts of the Magadhan Empire. Shankaragana' son, Buddharaja (r. 600\u2013625) was defeated by Chalukyas and lost southern territories and was ultimately defeated and conquered by the Kannauj Empire under Harsha.\nKannauj Interregnum to Rashtrakuta feudatory\nHarsha of the Kannauj Empire conquered Malwa around 625 of which it remained a part until his death 647. Following this the history of Malwa is mostly unknown. In 756 AD, the Gurjara Empire conquered Malwa. In 786, the Rashtrakuta Empire conquered the region from the Gurjaras. During this period, Malwa was made a vassal kingdom under the House of Paramara.\nHouse of Paramara (947\u20131305)\nIn 947 AD, Siyaka, the ruler of Malwa and vassal of the Rashtrakuta Empire declared his independence. His son Munja defeated Sambhar, Mewar, Tripuri, Nadol and Gurjaratra. However, in 998, the Chalukya Kingdom of Kalyani defeated and conquered the southern territories of Malwa. His brother succeeded him and defeated Kalyani kingdom and took back the lost territories. His grandson Bhoja (r. 1010\u20131055) made extensive conquests. He made an alliance between the Kingdom of Tripuri, the Chola empire and the Kingdom of Malwa and defeated the Kingdom of Kalyani. In 1048, the Kingdom of Kalyani invaded and sacked the capital of Malwa, and forced to cede territories up till the Narmada.\nAfter his death, he was succeeded by his son. Jayasimha I was defeated by an alliance of Gujarat and Tripuri. Jayasimha's successor and Bhoja's brother Udayaditya was defeated by Chamundaraja, his vassal at Vagada. He repulsed an invasion by the King of",
    "The Bornplatz Synagogue\u00a0 in Hamburg, viewed from Beneckestrasse\nThe Jewish Community of Hamburg is one of the larger Jewish communities in Germany, with 2,289 members (as of 2021). It forms an independent state association within the nationwide Central Council of Jews in Germany. The chair of the community is Philipp Stricharz.\nIn addition to the Jewish Community of Hamburg, there is also the \"Liberal Jewish Community of Hamburg\" with over 300 members and the \"Jewish Educational Center Chabad Lubavitch Hamburg e.V.\".\nHistory of the Jewish Communities\nSephardim from 1590 to 1939 in Hamburg and Altona\nThe Neweh Schalom Synagogue in Altona\nSephardim originating from Portugal settled in Hamburg from 1590 onwards, initially without founding a community. At first, many Sephardim, whose families had converted to Catholicism under threat of death, did not openly practice Judaism. In 1612, the Hamburg Council granted Sephardic Jews equal commercial rights to other Hamburg citizens through the \"Kaufmannshantierung\". The Sephardim founded three synagogue communities called Kether Thorah, Neweh Schalom and Thalmud Thorah, which they united in 1652 into the Holy Community of the Sephardim Beith Israel. One notable member was Herbert Pardo, who served multiple times as its chairman until 1933. The Sephardic community existed independently until it was forcibly incorporated into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg in July 1939.\nIn Altona, which had belonged to Hamburg since 1937, Sephardim had lived since before 1647. They founded the Holy Community Neweh Schalom only in 1770, which the few remaining members dissolved in 1887 due to too few members.\nAshkenazim from 1610 to 1945\nHamburg until 1812\nAshkenazim first gained the possibility of residence in Hamburg around 1610, provided they were employed as staff in Sephardic households or businesses. The Sephardim called the Ashkenazi Jews \"Tudescos\" (Portuguese for 'Germans'). Around 1661/1662 they founded the German-Israelite Community of Hamburg (DIG). The city of Hamburg granted residence permits very restrictively, so the DIG in Hamburg was smaller than its branch communities in Altona and Wandsbek (part of Hamburg since 1937). Ashkenazim without residence permits generally had to spend the night outside Hamburg and therefore officially chose their place of residence in the aforementioned, then Danish-Holstein cities. However, since they earned their livelihoods predominantly in Hamburg, they usually spent their days in Hamburg. From 1671 to 1812, the DIG formed part of the so-called Three Communities AHU (Altona, Hamburg, Wandsbek). From 1812 to 1938, the DIG existed independently and then merged into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg.\nIn 1710, the city of Hamburg issued the Regulations for the Jewish Community in Hamburg of both Portuguese and High German People. This came about through the mediation of Emperor Joseph I, who thus did not want to give up the old imperial Jewish regalia.\nIn Altona until 1938\nFour Ashkenazim are documented in Altona before 1611. A community, the High German Israelite Community in Altona (HIG), was founded after 1611. Between 1621 and 1812, the HIG operated a branch in Hamburg for Ashkenazim who could not obtain a residence permit in Hamburg and therefore formally had their place of residence in the liberal Holstein-Pinneberg Altona (belonging to Danish-ruled Holstein-Rendsburg from 1640). From 1671 to 1812, the HIG was the leading member of the Three Communities AHU (Altona, Hamburg, Wandsbek). It existed independently from 1812 to 1938 and then merged into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg.\nIn Wandsbek until 1938\nThe Israelite Community of Wandsbek (IGW) was founded in Wandsbek sometime between 1621 and 1650. From 1688 to 1812, the IGW maintained a branch in Hamburg for Ashkenazim who did not receive a residence permit in Hamburg and therefore formally took up residence in the liberal Danish-Holstein Wandsbek. The IGW was also a member of the Three Communities AHU (Altona, Hamburg, Wandsbek) from 1671 to 1812. It existed independently from 1812 to 1938 and then merged into the Jewish Religious Association in Hamburg.\nThe \"Three Communities of Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbek\" from 1671 to 1812\nIn 1671, the DIG, HIG and IGW founded a community alliance through a contract, the so-called Three Communities of Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbek (AHU). The umbrella organization provided services for all three communities and their respective branch communities. This included a joint religious court (Beth Din), joint cemeteries, hospitals and other facilities. Through the Napoleonic conquest of 1806 and the annexation of Hamburg as part of the First French Empire from 1811 to 1814, all residence of Hamburg, including Jews, gained French citizenship and thus equal civil rights. In the Empire, all Jewish communities were subject to the central Jewish Consistory of France. Therefore, the DIG had to abandon the community alliance with the n",
    "American painter and writer (1890\u20131974)\nHarry de Cleyre (1890\u20131974) was and American house painter and writer. The son of Voltairine de Cleyre and James B. Elliott, he was abandoned by his mother and neglected by his father during his childhood. He struggled to apply himself in his education and was forced to start work at the age of 10. After his mother's death, he devoted himself to studying her work and preserving her memory; he became a key primary source on her life, writing several letters about her to Joseph Ishill and Agnes Inglis.\nBiography\nHarry de Cleyre was born on June 12, 1890, in Philadelphia, the son of the anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre and the freethinker James B. Elliott. He was born by the name Vermorel Elliott, named after the Communard Auguste-Jean-Marie Vermorel. His mother was neither physically nor emotionally able to cope with raising Harry, so she left him in the care of his father. Feeling abandoned, Harry would refer to himself as a \"bastard\" throughout the rest of his life.\nDe Cleyre's mother remained a stranger to him during his early life, even though she lived close by. According to Harry's own daughters, \"he just did not fit into her life, her plans, at all.\" She briefly attempted to give him piano lessons, but he didn't apply himself, so she stopped. By the turn of the century, his father had succombed to mental illness and left him to fend for himself. He went to work at the age of 10, his income supplemented only by a small weekly allowance from his mother. His aunt Adelaide D. Thayer remembered him always feeling depressed, which she attributed to his mother. At one point, Thayer asked if she could take care of him; while his mother cared little for what was done with him, his father refused to relinquish custody. At the age of 16, he enrolled in a technical school, as he had grown up loving machines and wanted to learn mechanical engineering. Although he was financially supported by his mother, he failed to apply himself to his studies, so his mother refused to pay for any more of his education. He later went to work as a housepainter.\nHe became closer with his mother once he reached the age of 15. By 1906, he was living with his mother and for some time paid her rent. She later recalled his passion for repairs and machinery, and assured her sister that rumors he had become a priest were untrue, saying: \"he is an ignorant boy and an alcoholic wreck; they wouldn't take him in for a minute.\" According to Emma Goldman, while he was \"overawed\" by his mother's intellect, he was also \"repelled by her austere mode of living.\"\nIn the spring of 1912, when his mother was on her deathbed, he travelled to Chicago to be by her side when she died. After his mother's death, Emma Goldman speculated that Harry had gone his own way, becoming \"one of the 100% Americans, commonplace and dull.\" Although neglected by his mother throughout his life, he never stopped loving her, even naming his eldest daughter \"Voltairine\". He also dropped his father's surname and adopted his mother's. While the rest of his maternal family continued to spell their name \"De Claire\", Harry adopted his mother's fashion of spelling it as \"de Cleyre\". Although he never took up his mother's anarchist philosophy, he expressed pride in her \"stubborn defense of those being oppressed.\" He also inherited his parents' love of Thomas Paine, which he passed on to his own daughters, and treated his mother's Selected Works as his own personal Bible.\nLater in his life, he spent much of his time talking about his mother. In a letter he sent to Joseph Ishill on October 15, 1934, he pointed out a number of mistakes in Emma Goldman's biography of De Cleyre, including the date and circumstances of her death, the false assertion that her father Hector De Claire had wanted her to become a nun, and the details of her lingustics tutoring. Nevertheless, he still described Goldman's biography as a \"glowing tribute\". In the same letter, he also described his mother's student Nathan Navro as \"a man whose integrity is unquestioned\", praising him for being \"free of petty jealousies\", unlike some of his mother's other admirers. In an October 28, 1934 letter to Joseph Ishill, de Cleyre described his mother's time in a convent, where according to him, she was allowed access to the Bible, which \"was denied to those of the Catholic faith.\" In an October 12, 1947 letter to Agnes Inglis, de Cleyre described his grandfather as a \"petty tyrant\". He also mentioned about how, during her time in a convent, his mother had considered becoming a nun. On December 29, 1947, he told Inglis that his mother had confided to him that it was Dyer Lum who had smuggled an explosive to Louis Lingg, which had allowed him to commit suicide. Inglis herself didn't believe this, thinking the prison authorities had killed Lingg, but this hypothesis was disputed by Alexander Berkman. On February 15, 1948, he confessed to Inglis of how his mother had been acquitted in a tri",
    "Welsh clergyman\nNot to be confused with John Hughes (minister, 1796\u20131860).\nJohn Hughes (1787 \u2013 1 November 1860) was a Welsh clergyman.\nBiography\nHughes was the son and heir of John Hughes, esq., of Llwyn Glas, Llanfihangel Geneu'r Glyn, near Aberystwyth. He was born in 1787. After attending the grammar school of Ystradmeurig, he became classical master at a large school at Putney, London, where he remained about eighteen months. As a lad he aspired to become a preacher. Returning to Wales he was ordained by the Bishop of St. Asaph in 1811. He was curate first for six years at Llandrillo yn Rh\u00f4s, near Conway, and afterwards at Foleshill, near Coventry. At Foleshill he became very popular; but when the vicar died, in 1822, Lord-chancellor Eldon refused the petition of the parishioners to bestow the living on him. Hughes therefore left, and settled at Tiddington, near Oxford. Here again his fame as a preacher soon filled the church, and students from Oxford were often among his hearers. He became in 1837 vicar of Aberystwyth and curate of Llanbadarn Fawr. In 1834 the living of the mother church of Llanbadarn was conferred on him, with a prebendal stall in the collegiate church of Brecon, and in 1859 Bishop Thirlwall gave him the archdeaconry of Cardigan. In the course of that year he visited eighty parishes, preaching in each. He died on 1 November 1860, aged 73. He was for many years the most popular preacher of the established church in Wales.\nHe published in Welsh, besides sermons, translations of Henry and Scott's 'Commentary,' as far as Deuteronomy, 1834, of Hall's 'Meditations,' and 'Y Nabl' (i.e. the Psaltery), a collection of Welsh psalms and hymns.\nHis English publications include, besides sermons:\n'The Domestic Ruler's Monitor,' 1821.\n'Pastoral Visitation,' 1822.\n'Esther and her People,'1832.\n'Ruth and her Kindred,' 1839.\n'The Self-Searcher.'\n'Psalms and Hymns for the use of the Church at Aberystwyth.'\n'The Heathen's Appeal.\nA volume of sermons, with biography by his son, the Rev.

    " Former Habsburg palace in Baden, Austria\nThis article is about the former Weilburg palace in Baden near Vienna. For the castle in Weilburg, Germany, see Schloss Weilburg.\nWeilburg palace dreaming in the valley, while the ruins of Rauheneck castle look down from the hill\nThe Weilburg palace (German: Schloss Weilburg) is a former neoclassical palace in Baden near Vienna, Austria. Constructed in 1820, it was a present from archduke Charles, duke of Teschen (1771\u20131847) to his beloved wife, princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg (1797\u20131829). The neoclassical design was by the architect Joseph Kornh\u00e4usel (1782\u20131860). It became the seat of the Teschen branch of the Habsburg family. A fire broke out in April 1945, probably lit by retreating soldiers of the Wehrmacht and as the Red Army prohibited the fire to be extinguished, the palace was destroyed. Due to misunderstanding and ignorance, the ruins were blown up in the 1960s.\nToday, nothing is left from this beautiful palace except the coat of arms, which once decorated the palace. The palace was once considered the most significant example of Biedermeier style in Austria.\nHistory\nPrincess Henrietta with archduke Albrecht in the 1820s\nArchduke Charles with his family in front of the Weilburg palace\nWeilburg palace seen from the north in 1820.

He was also the younger brother of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. However, he had been adopted and raised by his childless aunt Marie Christine of Austria and her husband Albert of Saxe-Teschen. He was the heir to the Duchy of Teschen and would succeed in 1822.\nThe archduke was epileptic, but achieved respect both as a commander and as a reformer of the Austrian army. He was considered one of Napoleon's more formidable opponents and one of the greatest generals of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He was the victor of the Battle of Aspern-Essling against Napoleon.\nOn 15 September/17 September 1815 in Weilburg, archduke Charles married princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg. The bride was almost eighteen years old and the groom forty-four. But the marriage proved to be a happy one. Henriette has been known as the person who popularized the Christmas tree in Vienna after it was already introduced by Fanny von Arnstein in 1814 during the Vienna Congress.\nShortly, after the marriage he decided to construct a summer residence as a present for his wife. The location for the palace was in Baden near Vienna, a spa town favoured by the Viennese elite and members of the imperial family, who constructed extensive villas nearby. The chosen plot was at the entrance of the Helenental valley, at the foot of a hill dominated by the ruins of Rauheneck castle and opposite the ruins of Rauhenstein castle. The land was owned by the Doblhoff family, who sold it to the archduke.\nThe architect Joseph Kornh\u00e4usel made the neoclassical design, who also rebuilt large parts of Baden in a Biedermeier style after a fire destroyed large parts of the town in 1812. The laying of the foundation stone took place on 13 September 1820, after which construction started. On 24 December 1821, archduke Charles presented the palace to his wife Henriette. The palace could be moved into on 4 June 1823. The building was named after Henriette's hometown Weilburg.\nWith a front length of 201 meters, the Weilburg palace was one of the most significant neoclassical buildings in Austria. Moritz Gottlieb Saphir (1795\u20131858), a contemporary, called it \"a stone poem, an epic built by a hero,\" alluding to the builder's military glory.\nOn the north side of the house, a coat of arms designed in stone by Josef Klieber (1773\u20131850) was placed on the attic of the seven-axial portico, combining the lion of the House of Nassau with the heraldic animals of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, the eagle and the lion.\nOn the night of 29 to 30 December 1829, Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg died in Vienna. In her will, she bequeathed the Weilburg palace to her eldest son Albrecht, who was still a minor. The management of the property was entrusted to his father, Archduke Karl, who passed away on 30 April 1847.\nArchduke Albrecht of Teschen\nArchduke Albrecht around 1895\nWeilburg palace seen from the ruins of Rauhenstein castle\nWeilburg palace - Detail from a landscape by Johann Raulino\nWeilburg palace by Franz Jaschke in 1823.

His parents were Hugh and Mary Hughes. His father was a carpenter, and he himself followed the same occupation till he was nineteen. When a lad of twelve he joined the Sunday-school which was then introduced into the neighbourhood, and made great progress. In 1810 he joined the Calvinistic Methodist church at Adwy, and three years later began preaching. On 13 September 1815 he opened a school at Cross Street, near Hope, Flintshire, but in August 1817 he went to school himself to learn Latin and Greek. After a time he opened a new school at Wrexham, and prepared many young men for the pulpit. He preached every Sunday. In February 1821 he was authorised as regular preacher to visit all parts of Wales, and in 1822 he preached before the Methodist Association. On 17 June 1829 he was ordained at Bala. In 1835, owing to bad health, he gave up his school, and became a flour merchant, in partnership with a brother. In 1838 he went to Liverpool, attained considerable eminence there as a preacher, and became co-pastor with Henry Rees of the Welsh Calvinistic churches of Liverpool. He died on a visit to Abergele 8 August 1860. He was twice married.\nHughes's chief work is his 'History of Welsh Calvinistic Methodism,' in three large volumes (Wrexham, vol. i. 1851, vol. ii. 1854, vol. iii. 1856). A volume containing twenty-two sermons, together with a memoir by the Rev. R. Edwards and the Rev. John Hughes of Everton, and a portrait, appeared in 1862.

    "Welsh Calvinistic Methodist minister\nHenry Rees (15 February 1798 \u2013 18 February 1869) was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist leader.\nBiography\nRees was the eldest son of David Rees of Chwibren Isaf in the parish of Llansannan, Denbighshire, and Anne (Williams) of Cefn Fforest. He was born on 15 February 1798. William Rees (1802\u20131883) was his brother. His father, who moved in a short time to Rhyd Loew, and thence to Cae Du in the same district, was a lay officer of the Calvinistic Methodist connection, and Henry showed at an early age a deep interest in religious work. In May 1816 he left home to take employment on a farm near Bettws Abergele, and while in this district, in the spring of 1819, began to preach. Resolving to devote himself to the Calvinistic Methodist ministry, he came home to Cae Du in May, and then placed himself for two years under the tuition of Thomas Lloyd of Abergele. It was not the practice of the ministers of his connection at this time to depend wholly on the ministry for support, and accordingly, in 1821, he went to Shrewsbury to learn bookbinding. In the following year he was persuaded by his friends in that town to accept instead the charge of the Calvinistic Methodist church there in return for his maintenance. He was ordained to the full work of the ministry at Bala on 13 June 1827, and on 20 October 1830 married Mary Roberts of Shrewsbury (d. 1879). During his stay in Shrewsbury Rees rapidly won a position as one of the foremost preachers of his connection, and from this time until his death was almost always to be heard at the great preaching meetings of the North Wales Association. At the end of 1836 he accepted the superintendence of the Calvinistic Methodist churches in Liverpool, where he spent the rest of his life. He died on 18 February 1869 at Benarth, near Conway, his son-in-law's house, and was buried in Llan Dysilio churchyard, near Menai Bridge. He left one daughter, Anne, the wife of Mr. Richard Davies of Treborth, lord lieutenant of Anglesey.\nRees devoted himself to the two duties of preaching and connectional administration. After the death of John Elias in 1841 he was for a quarter of a century the recognised leader of the Calvinistic Methodists of North Wales, and had the largest share in forming the policy of the northern association. As a preacher he had scarcely a rival in the denomination, his sermons being marked by careful preparation, closeness of texture, and purity of diction, coupled with great earnestness and force. He distrusted rhetorical effect. A selection of his sermons was published at Holywell, in three volumes (1872, 1875, 1881).\n",

After passing the agr\u00e9gation in philosophy in 1827, he taught in Versailles, then in the Parisian colleges of Saint Louis (from 1833), Louis-le-Grand (from 1835 to 1838), and Henri-IV (1840\u20131841) as well as at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (1834\u20131835).\nOn May 25, 1840, Garnier defended his two theses for the Doctorate of Letters at the University of Paris. The first, in French, is a critique of the philosophy of Thomas Reid. The second, in Latin, is a reflection on poetry.\nHe was appointed assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Paris Faculty of Letters in 1842, then succeeded Jouffroy in the chair of dogmatic philosophy in 1845 in this university. He was elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques in 1860.\nHis work on Social Morality was awarded a Montyon Prize in 1850. His Treatise on the Faculties of the Soul, considered his most important work, earned him his second Montyon Prize in 1853 and was hailed by the Revue des Deux Mondes as \"the best monument of psychological science of our time\". He also contributed to Le Globe.\nHe is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.\nWorks\nDe la Peine de mort, 1827\nPr\u00e9cis d'un cours de psychologie, 1831.

    "2nd century BCE wall\nTower of David and remains of the first wall\nThe First Wall (also called The Old Wall) is one of three strong and fortified walls that were built for the defense of Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period. This wall was built during the Hasmonean period, but its foundations are older and were laid already in the First Temple period. During the time of the Return to Zion, the wall was rebuilt by Nehemiah, and in the days of the Hasmoneans, it was strengthened and even additional parts of it were built. The additional walls are the Second Wall - built during the days of the Hasmonean rulers John Hyrcanus or Alexander Jannaeus, and the Third Wall - construction began in the days of Agrippa I, and its construction was completed on the eve of the Great Revolt.\nBackground\nThroughout the entire Hellenistic period, the boundaries of the city hardly changed since the days of the Return to Zion. The Second Temple was located in the same place where it was initially in the days of the First Temple, and the city - the City of David - was to its south. In the 2nd century BCE, during the reign of the Hasmoneans, the city began to significantly expand towards the western hill, where the Hasmonean palace was built. The area was characterized by luxurious architectural style, and its inhabitants included the wealthy and respected. The new area, which with its expansion and establishment to the west, began to expand also to the north, was called \"the Upper City\" and around it a new wall was built, \"the First Wall,\" which actually enclosed the Lower City together with the Upper City. Both essentially constituted the main part of Jerusalem. Due to the city's location near the Kidron Valley to the east and the Valley of Hinnom to the south, which served as \"natural barriers\" for topographical reasons, the city was later expanded only towards the west and the north, while the eastern and southern boundaries remained unchanged.\nThe course of the wall\nWithin the first wall's boundaries included the City of David and Mount Zion, whereas most of the areas that are today within the boundaries of the Ottoman wall of Jerusalem were outside the first wall. The wall began in the area of the citadel (Tower of David) from there the wall descended along the southern ridge line of Mount Zion on a rocky cliff towards the Pool of Siloam, in the southern section of the wall the Essenes Gate was established which led to the desert. From there, the wall turned east and north on the eastern slope of the City of David, in a line parallel to the Kidron Valley. The wall passed through the Ophel area, and connected to the wall of the Temple Mount slightly north to the southwest corner, to allow entry to the Temple Mount from the east. The area of connection of the first wall to the Temple Mount wall is called \"the seam\" due to the meeting of two building styles. The northern part of the wall started from the Tower of David eastward to the Temple Mount parallel to the Tyropoeon Valley (David Street and Chain Street). In the northern wall were established several gates, among them \"the Hidden Gate\" and \"Garden Gate\". Above the remains of the first wall and more or less in the same course, about 400 years later, in the Byzantine period, a new wall was built by Empress Eudocia. The fact that two walls were built 400 years apart in the same course without their builders knowing about each other, proves that the topographic location of the first wall is the most correct for defending the city.\nAdditional fortifications along the wall\nIn the fortress area where the first wall begins, Herod strengthened the wall, Phasael Tower, and Tower of David, and built the Hippicus Tower ('Tower of David'). The section south of the fortress, where the wall was built on rock to protect the western part of the Upper City, was also fortified, and nearby, the palace was built. The wall served as a supporting wall of the structure, and an adjacent front wall was added with a thickness of up to 3.5 meters. This wall later served as the foundation for the Ottoman wall (remnants that exist to our days).\nRemnants of the first wall existing today\nToday, there are clear remnants of the First Wall in these places:\nIn the area of the citadel, which is called today \"Tower of David\"\nIn the Mamilla area, west of the current wall, there are remnants of Hasmonean fortifications.\nIn the Jewish Quarter, close to the Israelite Tower and remnants of a gate which is probably \"Gennath Gate\".\nAt the base of the eastern wall of the Temple Mount.\nOn the southern slopes of Mount Zion.\n",
    "American planter and slave trader (~1819\u20131876)\nJosiah Maples (c.\u20091819\u00a0\u2013 September 22, 1876) was a 19th-century cotton plantation owner, bank director, and slave trader of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas in the United States (and the Confederate States during the American Civil War). Maples is notable as a slave-trading business partner of Nathan Bedford Forrest.\nBiography\nJosiah Maples was born in Alabama in approximately 1818 or 1820. In July 1849 Maples was appointed to a \"committee of twenty\" in DeSoto County, Mississippi that produced a resolution that opposed the Wilmot Proviso, protested northern aggression, and \"Resolved, 5th. That while we cherish for the Union a lasting and warm regard, yet, we are not to be frightened from maintaining our just rights by being taunted with the name of disunionist feeling that whatever may be the result of this agitation it is chargeable not only on us who only stand on our rights under the constitution, but on those who have on this subject violated every guaranty of that sacred instrument.\" In 1851 Maples was the treasurer of the Masonic Lodge in DeSoto County. In 1852 the sheriff of Shelby County, Tennessee reported that his jail held a 23-year-old runaway slave named Philip, \"5 feet, 6 or 7 inches high, weighs about 140 pounds; belongs to Josiah Maples, of De Soto county, Miss.\" On or about October 1, 1853, Maples married Mary A. Marshall in Fayette County, Tennessee. On July 15, 1854, Maples patented 40 acres of land in Cherokee County, Alabama.\nMaples was one of three major business partners of slave trader Nathan Bedford Forrest, along with (serially, not simultaneously) Seaborne S. Jones and Byrd Hill. (Forrest's five brothers also worked in the business.) According to a history of DeSoto County, Mississippi produced by the WPA in the late 1930s, \"An interesting fact concerning Gen. Forrest, related by , was his having worked for Josiah Maples in his youth, on the old Evans place, a few miles from Pleasant Hill\". Maples and Forrest were in business together as Forrest & Maples from July 1854 to December 31, 1855.  In November 1854 they sold a nine-year-old girl named Page to Lavinia and Lemuel Smith for $600. On July 9, 1855, they sold Adisson, age 22, to V. Beckworth for $1,000. Also in 1855, Forrest & Maples sold Mary, age 15, for $800. On New Year's 1856 the Maples and Forrest partnership was dissolved. \nAt the time of the 1860 U.S. federal census, Maples, occupation \"planter,\" with personal property valued at $10,000, lived in Redfork Township, Desha County, Arkansas, in a household shared with an overseer, a housekeeper, and their respective families. The slave schedules show that 70 enslaved people worked on Maples' plantation. In March 1861, Maples was elected a director of the Bank of West Tennessee. During the American Civil War he sold some cotton that was later partially burned by Union troops; there was a lawsuit. The case Butler v. Maples \"established that buying cotton through an insurrectionary area through an agent licensed by the Treasury Department was legal\".\nJosiah Maples, last will and testament, made July 20, 1876\nMaples was enumerated as a resident of Desha County, Arkansas during the 1870 census, along with his wife, Mary A. Maples, and their three children, Lizzie, Marshall, and Clement. In 1875 he was described as \"one of the heaviest cotton planters of the Arkansas valley\". In 1876 Maples' primary residence was listed as Red Fork, Arkansas. Red Fork was described as \"a post office and landing on the Arkansas River, thirty miles above its mouth, and four miles from Watson, the county seat of Desha county\". Maples was considered a pioneer of Desha County,  and a leading, if not the leading, citizen of the area of fertile bottomland that was said to \"frequently  two bales of cotton to the acre\".\nMaples died in the Raleigh section of Memphis on September 22, 1876, after a long illness. Maples was buried in Rossville, Tennessee.\nSee also\nForrest's slave jail\nMemphis and Hernando Plank Road\nList of American slave traders\n",

    "Producer of architectural terra cotta\nThe New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company was a manufacturer of architectural terracotta based in Queens, New York, U.S.\nHistory\nBeginning in the 1870s, architectural terracotta grew in popularity in the United States after architects were drawn to its adaptability for various aesthetic styles and its inherent fireproof qualities. The initial companies to find success were the Chicago Terra Cotta Works and the Perth Amboy Terra Cotta Company, but New York real estate magnate Orlando B. Potter saw an opportunity for a company based closer to New York City to succeed and founded the New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company with his son-in-law Walter Geer in 1886.\nThey recruited James Taylor, a ceramicist often described as \"the father of architectural terracotta\" in the United States, to act as superintendent of the new company's factory in Ravenswood, New York. Less than three months after the company began producing terracotta the entire factory was destroyed by fire. Taylor announced they would rebuild immediately and temporary sheds were built. A new factory, with an automatic sprinkler system, was built and operational in a few months and the company's rebirth was hailed by the community as \"Phoenix-like.\"\nThe company's 1892 office building in Queens, New York, designed by Francis H. Kimball\nIn 1892 the company constructed an office building, separate from its manufacturing facility, designed by architect Francis H. Kimball. As was often the case at the time the building was designed to showcase the various products the company was capable of producing, with a Renaissance and Tudor Revival design incorporating terracotta panels, chimney pots, and clay roof tiles.\nThe company was the fourth largest employer in Long Island City by 1915 and remained successful into the 1920s. A second manufacturing site was built in Old Bridge, New Jersey and the company went bankrupt in 1928\u20131929.\nAfter dissolution\nRichard Dalton, who had been president of the company from 1919 to 1928, formed the Eastern Terra Cotta Company in 1931 and used both of the New York Architectural Terra-Cotta Company's facilities. This new company remained in operation until the mid-1940s, after which the 1892 office was used by Dalton for his construction company. When he died in 1968 the Queens property was sold to Citibank, which demolished the remaining manufacturing works.\nDespite opposition from Citibank and Queens borough president Donald Manes, the 1892 building was designated a New York City Landmark in an unusually fast application process in 1982. Afterwards it drew increasing attention for its unique architecture and in 1999 it was purchased by Stuart Match Suna, president of Silvercup Studios. Historic preservationists were initially happy about this purchase due to Suna's wife being an architect on the Landmarks Commission, but Suna did not make efforts to maintain the structure until forced to by lawyers from the Landmarks Commission. In the 2020s the building underwent restorations to the interior and exterior of the structure.\nNotable projects\nThe company produced architectural terracotta for many prominent buildings in and around New York City, including the Lincoln Building, the Corbin Building, the Schermerhorn Building, the Old Grolier Club, the Montauk Club, Carnegie Hall, and The Ansonia.\nGallery\nOrnamental terracotta on Carnegie Hall\nArchitectural terracotta seen on Schermerhorn Building\nArchitectural terracotta seen on facade of the Ansonia\nChimney pots on the 1892 office building\nDecorative terracotta on the 1892 office building\nSee also\nArchitectural terracotta\nGlazed architectural terra-cotta\nAtlantic Terra Cotta Company\n",
    "Galaxy in the constellation Leo\nNGC 3800 is an intermediate spiral galaxy located in the constellation Leo. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 3,653 \u00b1 24\u00a0km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 53.9 \u00b1 3.8 Mpc (\u223c176 million ly). NGC 3800 was discovered by German-British astronomer William Herschel in 1784.\nNGC 3799 and NGC 3800 are two gravitationally interacting galaxies and appear in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the symbol Arp 83. Halton Arp describes these as an example of galaxies by presenting a bridge of matter between them and having a high surface gloss.\nThe luminosity class of NGC 3800 is II and it has a broad HI line.\nTo date, four non-redshift measurements give a distance of 42.125 \u00b1 1.162 Mpc (\u223c137 million ly), which is well outside the Hubble distance values. Note, however, that it is with the average value of independent measurements, when they exist, that the NASA/IPAC database calculates the diameter of a galaxy and that consequently the diameter of NGC 3800 could be approximately 32.8 kpc (\u223c107,000 ly) if we used the Hubble distance to calculate it.\nNGC 3800 group\nThe galaxy NGC 3800 is part of a group of galaxies named after him. The NGC 3800 group has at least 16 members. Other New General Catalog galaxies in this group are NGC 3768, NGC 3790, NGC 3799, NGC 3801, NGC 3802, NGC 3806, NGC 3827 and NGC 3853. Other galaxies in the group are UGC 6631, UGC 6653, UGC 6666, UGC 6794, MCG 3-30-33 and MCG 3-30-38.\nAbraham Mahtessian also mentions the existence of this group, but only the galaxies NGC 3768, NGC 3790, NGC 3801 and NGC 3827 appear there. The galaxy NGC 3853 appears in Mahtessian's article, but under another entry where it forms a galaxy pair with UGC 6666, designated as 1139+1618 (CGCG 1139.7+1648). Similarly, the galaxies NGC 3799 and NGC 3800 are also listed under another entry in this article as a pair of galaxies.\nThe NASA/IPAC database indicates that NGC 3800 is possibly a field galaxy, that is, it does not belong to a cluster or group and is therefore gravitationally isolated. Scientists have concluded that this is most likely not the case.\nSee also\nList of NGC objects (3001\u20134000)\nAtlas of Peculiar Galaxies\nExternal links\nNGC 3800 at SIMBAD\n",
    "Football club\nSociet\u00e0 Sportiva Palestra It\u00e1lia (Venetian: ), known simply as Palestra or Palestra It\u00e1lia, is a sports club based in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Although competing in a number of different sports, Palestra is mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the JK Stadium.\nHistory\nPalestra's history is traced back to the Italian community living in Belo Horizonte, a city where already some Italian immigrants lived and their desire to set up a football club. Similar to the Italians of S\u00e3o Paulo (who founded Palestra It\u00e1lia, now known as Palmeiras) the people of Belo Horizonte wanted the Italian colonies in Minas Gerais to have its own club as well.\nIn the sporting goods and footwear Augustine Ranieri's factory, located on the street of Caet\u00e9s, it was decided the foundation of the club should tackle the three major capital: Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, America-MG and Yale. Was born at that moment, the Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Palestra Italia, established on 2 January 1921.\nThe meeting was attended by 95 founders present the shield and uniform that made reference to the Italian colors, and whose SSPI description would be recorded in the center shell. Another decision was that only members of the Italian colony could wear the shirt. Aurelio Noce was elected the first President.\nThe Palestra Italia emerged as the representative of the Italian colony. And is characterized as a team of Italian descent, Palestra also stood out by having elements of the Belo Horizonte working class, unlike Atl\u00e9tico and Am\u00e9rica, who had their consisting squad of college students coming from influential and wealthy families of the city.\nA Palestra squad before playing a game v. Flamengo in 1923\nThe idea of the club being created took a big step when Yale, a sports team from the city, went through an administrative crisis. When some players left Yale over a dispute (Yale, which itself had connections to the Italian community), some went on to found the all Italian, Sociedade Esportiva Palestra It\u00e1lia of Belo Horizonte. Until 1925 the club would only allow Italian men to participate, despite other teams in the nation accepting people of all skin colors and ethnicities.\nPalestra debuted in the Prado Mineiro Stadium with a 2\u20130 win in a friendly on 3 April 1921, against a combination from Nova Lima. The Nova Lima team united players from two teams from the city: Villa Nova, and Palmeiras, another team form Nova Lima. However, the first official match of Palestra was in a 3\u20130 win over future archrivals Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro.\nIn January 1942, Brazil entered World War II and a decree of the federal government forbade the use of terms from enemy nations in entities, institutions, establishments, etc. With this, the Italian name was removed and the club could no longer call themselves Palestra Italia. The name was changed to Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Mineiro.\n",
    "1991 song by Tony Banks and Nik Kershaw\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" is a song by English musician Tony Banks featuring English singer Nik Kershaw. It was released by Virgin on 7 May 1991 as the lead single from Banks's third solo studio album, Still. The song was written by Banks and Kershaw, and produced by Banks and Nick Davis. It reached number 76 in the UK Singles Chart.\nBackground\nTony Banks collaborated with Nik Kershaw after getting in contact with him by phone. Banks became an admirer of Kershaw after getting a copy of his 1989 album The Works. He later recalled the album had \"some wonderful stuff on it\" and liked Kershaw's voice. Banks told Sound on Sound in 1991, \"He was very enthusiastic about working with me, and it was nice that he decided to sing my songs, seeing as he'd never sung for anyone else.\" Kershaw co-wrote two tracks with Banks and provided vocals on them and another track for Banks' album Still: \"Red Day on Blue Street\", \"I Wanna Change the Score\" and \"The Final Curtain\".\nRelease\nAlthough Kershaw's name appeared alongside Banks's on the single's picture sleeve, it was omitted on the vinyl's label by Virgin Records. Banks told Simon Mayo in 1991, \"I wanted to have the  as 'Nik Kershaw with Tony Banks' but the record company said people would probably think it was Nik's record anyway and they were worried it might not be associated with the  album. But they weren't supposed to go as far as leaving his name off!\"\nMusic video\nThe song's music video was directed by Nick Willing. It features Banks and Kershaw performing the song as the background changes to show them in different locations and settings.\nCritical reception\nUpon its release as a single, Music & Media called \"I Wanna Change the Score\" a \"catchy track\". Andrew Hirst of the Huddersfield Daily Examiner noted that the \"artful chorus is badly let down by the bland bits inbetween\". Marcus Hodge of the Cambridge Evening News commented, \"Kershaw sounds remarkably like his protege, Chesney Hawkes, but he seems to have given Chesney his best song as this is quite dreary.\" South Wales Echo gave a one out of five star rating and wrote, \"The score is nil-nil, both deserve the red card for taking part in this meaningless MOR friendly.\"\nTrack listing\n7\u2013inch single (UK and Europe) and cassette single (UK)\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" \u2013 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" \u2013 4:41\n12\u2013inch single (UK and Europe)\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" \u2013 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" \u2013 4:41\n\"Big Man\" \u2013 4:10\nCD single (UK)\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" \u2013 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" \u2013 4:41\n\"Big Man\" \u2013 4:10\n\"The Waters of Lethe\" \u2013 6:31\nCD single (Japan)\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\" \u2013 4:29\n\"Hero for an Hour\" \u2013 4:41\nPersonnel\n\"I Wanna Change the Score\"\nNik Kershaw \u2013 vocals\nDaryl Stuermer \u2013 guitar\nTony Banks \u2013 keyboards\nJames Eller \u2013 bass\nGraham Broad \u2013 drums\nLu\u00eds Jardim \u2013 percussion\n\"Hero for an Hour\"\nTony Banks \u2013 vocals, keyboards, bass synth\nDaryl Stuermer \u2013 guitar\nMartin Robertson \u2013 saxophone\nVinnie Colaiuta \u2013 drums\nLu\u00eds Jardim \u2013 percussion\nProduction\nTony Banks \u2013 production (all tracks)\nNick Davis \u2013 production and engineering (\"I Wanna Change the Score\", \"Hero for an Hour\")\nMark Robinson \u2013 assistant engineering (\"I Wanna Change the Score\", \"Hero for an Hour\")\nSteve Hillage \u2013 production (\"Big Man\")\nSteve Chase \u2013 engineering (\"Big Man\")\nDavid Hentschel \u2013 production and engineering (\"The Waters of Lethe\")\nDavid Bascombe \u2013 engineering (\"The Waters of Lethe\")\nOther\nCarl Studna \u2013 photography\nWherefore Art \u2013 design\nCharts\n",
    "Daily newspaper from Peru\nDiario Expreso is a daily newspaper with national circulation in Peru. Founded in 1961, it is among the newspapers with the highest circulation in Peru.\nHistory\nIt was founded on October 24, 1961, by Manuel Mujica Gallo\u00a0, a wealthy owner linked to the banking and insurance business. For this purpose, the company Period\u00edstica Per\u00fa S. A. was established. In this first stage, its editors were Manuel Jes\u00fas Orbegoso, Ra\u00fal Villar\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Encinas de Pando, among others.\nIn 1965, it was acquired by Manuel Ulloa El\u00edas, who founded Editora Nacional S. A. The same company published the evening newspaper Extra\u00a0. In this new stage, Efra\u00edn Ruiz Caro\u00a0 and Guillermo Cortez N\u00fa\u00f1ez were editors-in-chief. Among his collaborators were Ciro Alegr\u00eda, Carlos Cueto Fernandini\u00a0, Manuel Mujica Gallo and Mario Vargas Llosa. A Sunday supplement entitled Estampas was also published; and as a contribution to education, the supplement El Escolar.\nWith the rise of a military government in 1968, difficulties began. On October 31 of that year, Expreso and Extra were closed by order of the regime of General Juan Velasco Alvarado. However, a protest by the Federation of Journalists of Peru forced the Government to allow the newspapers to reopen.\nOn January 2, 1970, Manuel Ulloa resigned as president of the board of directors of Editora Nacional S. A. because a Government decree prevented those who resided outside the country for more than six months from exercising such function. Ulloa, who had been an important minister of the overthrown Belaundista government, chose not to return to Peru after considering that a political persecution had been unleashed against him.\nOn March 4, 1970, Expreso and Extra were practically expropriated by the military government, with the excuse of handing over their administration to their own employees and workers, organized in cooperatives. However, people outside the newspapers took control of them. In this stage of expropriation, the following served as directors of Expreso: Alberto Ruiz Eldredge\u00a0, Leopoldo Chiappo\u00a0 and Juan Jos\u00e9 Vega\u00a0, all appointed by the government. Some time later, Velasco explained that he had given the newspapers to the communists to serve as \"mastiffs\" (prey dogs) in his \"fight against the oligarchy.\"\nAfter the revolutionary government ended on July 28, 1980, Expreso and Extra returned to their owners, and Manuel Ulloa took over again as president of the board of Editora Nacional S. A. The first director of Expreso, in this new stage, was Guillermo Cortez N\u00fa\u00f1ez (1980\u20131988), who was succeeded by Manuel D'Ornellas (1988\u20131998). It then had a prestigious team of journalists, among which Jaime de Althaus\u00a0, Jorge Morelli, Uri Ben Schmuel and Patricio Ricketts stood out.\nDuring the government of Alberto Fujimori (1990\u20132000), the newspaper's directors were committed to selling their editorial line to the interests of the regime. After the fall of Fujimori, the imprisonment of the newspaper's director, Eduardo Calmell del Solar\u00a0, was ordered, accused of having received, together with Vicente Silva Checa (director of Cable Canal de Noticias\u00a0), more than US$ 3,000,000 from presidential advisor Vladimiro Montesinos.\nIn 2002, a new organization came into operation under the direction of Luis Garc\u00eda Mir\u00f3, whose objective was to recover the prestige of the newspaper. Since 2024, the director is Antonio Ram\u00edrez Pando.\nSee also\nEl Comercio Group\n",

Choi went on to star in various productions after his first film role, including the horror film Twilight Online (2014), martial arts film Ip Man 3, crime film Imprisoned (both 2015), and comedy film The Yuppie Fantasia 3 (2017). He landed his first sole leading role as Tim Cheung in the horror film Vampire Cleanup Department (2017), followed by a breakout performance as a sacrificing policeman in the action film Shock Wave (2017). He also starred as Cel in the Storm Film Series, beginning with L Storm (2018) and concluded with the series finale G Storm (2021), and Lo Man Nai in the ViuTV drama series No One Lies (2023).\nEarly life and education\nBabyjohn Choi was born Choi Ming Yin on 8 December 1986 in Hong Kong. He grew up in Mei Foo and was raised by his grandparents. He began learning piano when he was three and later passed ABRSM Grade 8 when he was in Form 4. His parents changed his name to Choi Hon Yick while he was studying in primary school due to feng shui. He later attended Wah Yan College, Kowloon, and spent most of his time in secondary school joining bands and playing music. When he was in Form 2, he participated in a school drama performance of West Side Story, portraying the character Baby John. The experience sparked his interest in performing, and he changed his English name to Babyjohn after his first acting role to remind himself of his passion. He took business subjects for the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination, but did not perform well, scoring only a pass in five subjects. Determined to pursue a career in acting, he intended to apply for the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts, but missed the deadline after receiving his HKCEE results. He then took a gap year to learn jazz music, guitar, and drums, and reapplied to HKAPA the following year. While in university, Choi formed a band and took part in the school's musical performances. He graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in performing arts in 2009. In the same year, Choi auditioned and won the role as Leung in the film The Way We Dance, but production did not begin until 2013. During the interval, he worked several jobs to make a living, including teaching music, performing in a theatre company, and filming advertisements. He left the theatre company after filming commenced.\nCareer\nChoi auditioned and won his debut role as Leung in the 2013 drama film The Way We Dance, where he portrayed the chairman of a university Tai Chi club who collaborated with a street dancer, portrayed by Cherry Ngan, to invent original dance choreographies incorporating Tai Chi moves. His performance was well received, for which he won Best New Performer in the 33rd Hong Kong Film Awards and was nominated for Best Newcomer in the 8th Asian Film Awards with the role. Choi began receiving film role offers after his breakout performance, starring in the lead role in the horror film Twilight Online, and voicing private investigator Bobby Mak in the animated comedy film McDull: Me & My Mum the following year. In 2015, Choi took on lead roles in the comedy film 12 Golden Ducks and crime film Imprisoned: Survival Guide for Rich and Prodigal, as well as minor roles in action films SPL II: A Time for Consequences and Ip Man 3. Choi was also cast in lead roles in the 2016 crime films House of Wolves and Fooling Around Jiang Hu\u00a0.\nIn 2017, Choi was cast as the sole male lead in Chiu Sin Hang's horror romance film Vampire Cleanup Department, portraying Tim Cheung, a vampire hunter who posed as a street janitor and developed romantic entanglements with a female vampire played by Lin Min Chen. He also starred in lead roles in the comedy film The Yuppie Fantasia 3 and the drama film 29+1. Choi gained further recognition in the 2017 action film Shock Wave as an off-duty cop who sacrificed himself in a bomb attack by terrorists. The film's director Herman Yau handpicked Choi for the role after watching The Way We Dance and was impressed by his acting. Although the role was minor, Choi's performance received universal praise and was described as \"tear-jerking\". He also took on lead roles as Fung the gangster in the black comedy film The Sinking City Capsule Odyssey\u00a0, starring alongside Pakho Chau and Louis Cheung, and as a wealthy playboy Si Tak Wah in the TVB drama series Oh My Grad\u00a0, at the invitation of his APA classmate Wong Cho-lam.\nThe following year, Choi landed a recurring role as Cel, an ICAC officer, in the Storm Film Series\u00a0, starting with the 2018 film L Storm and reprised his role in the 2019 sequel P Storm. Choi also took on a lead role in the mystery thriller film Guilt by Design\u00a0, which featured an ensemble cast including Nick",
    "\nIf We Burn: The Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution is a 2023 political history and journalism book by author and journalist Vincent Bevins. The book concerns the wave of mass protests during the 2010s decade and examines the question of how the organization and tactics of such protests resulted in a \"missing revolution,\" in that most of these movements appear to have failed in their goals and even led to a \"record of failures, setbacks, and cataclysms\". The title refers to a protest sign during the 2014 Hong Kong protests which quoted The Hunger Games line, \"If we burn, you burn with us.\"\nThe book begins by tracing the history of left wing activism from the end of the October Revolution, through the New Left and into the present day. In particular, it traces the history of Vanguardism in left wing movement politics and the shift toward distributed, horizontal structures in mass protest movements since the early 20th century. The final chapter assesses the problems with the horizontally-structured movements of the 2010s and observes that the lack of central leadership enabled media misrepresentation of movement interests which subsequently defused and dissipated the energy and efficacy of the movements. Simultaneously, the lack of leadership structure also allowed right-wing groups to coopt social movements for their own purposes, leading in part to a full reversal of momentum as in Brazil.\nThe book draws on four years of research and hundreds of interviews, including with many of the original organizers of major protest movements. Bevins admits to not being a neutral observer: he was an active participant in the Movimento Passe Livre in Brazil. The book stems in part from observations on the failure of that movement and Bevins is clear to indicate where his own actions alter the trajectory of the movement.\nMovements included in the book, inter alia:\nMovimento Passe Livre, in Brazil\nArab Spring, particularly in Tunisia and Egypt\nOccupy Wall Street, in the United States\n2014 Hong Kong protests\nEuromaidan, in Ukraine\nReception\nAccording to literary review aggregator Lit Hub, the book received mostly \"Positive\" reviews. It currently has a score of 4.31 stars on Goodreads.\n\"I was not expecting this, but I think If We Burn is even better than The Jakarta Method.\"\u2014Benjamin Fogel, editor at Jacobin\nWriting for The New Republic, Osita Nwanevu agreed that future protest movements should take Bevins' conclusions into account, but critiqued the implicit horizontalism of the protest movements themselves:Lenin aside, this is all rather commonsensical\u2014or at least it ought to have been for the movements surveyed. Change is best pursued with a particular tactical or ideological direction in mind, clearly; without a designated leader or group of leaders to set that direction\u2014a \"vanguard,\" if one prefers\u2014one cannot predict the direction a movement will ultimately take, or what ideas and actors might prevail in the aftermath of a movement toppling the existing political order.\n",
    "English Royal Navy admiral\nJames Hutton (3 September 1715 \u2013 3 May 1795) was an English Moravian minister and bookseller.\nBiography\nHutton the son of the Rev. John Hutton by Elizabeth Ayscough. He was born in London on 3 September 1715. The father, a nonjuring clergyman who had resigned his living, resided in College Street, Westminster, where he took Westminster boys to board. He was a friend of Dr. Burney. James Hutton was educated at Westminster, and was apprenticed to Mr. Innys, a bookseller of St. Paul's Churchyard. About 1736 he opened a bookshop of his own at the Bible and Sun, west of Temple Bar. But he never paid much attention to business. Before the end of his apprenticeship he had met the Wesleys at Oxford, and when they left for Georgia in 1735 he accompanied 'them to Gravesend; in 1738 and 1739 he published Whitefield's 'Journal.' In London Hutton soon started a small society for prayer, and corresponded with many Methodists; his mother remained a strong churchwoman, and wrote to Samuel Wesley, who was not of his brother's way of thinking, that John Wesley was her son's pope. But Hutton had in 1737 been introduced by John Wesley to Peter Bohler and two other Moravian brethren then on their way to Georgia, and thenceforth he inclined to Moravianism. In 1739 he set out for Germany, where he visited the Moravian congregations, and began a correspondence with Nicolaus Zinzendorf. When John Wesley was separating himself from the Moravians, he made a vain attempt in 1739 to induce Hutton to follow his example, and in 1740, after Wesley had induced several members of Hutton's society, which met then at the Fetter Lane Chapel, to abandon it for his Foundry Society, the disruption between Hutton and himself was complete. They were subsequently reconciled, and Wesley noted in his \u2018Journal' after Hutton had paid him a visit that he believed Hutton would be saved, but as by fire.\nHutton was till his death an active Moravian leader. He often visited Germany, and in 1741 became, by August Gottlieb Spangenberg's advice, one of the founders of the Society for the Furtherance of the Gospel, and acted as 'referendary' for many years. 'Pray,\u2019 Lord Shelburne asked him, in the course of an interview in which the projected Moravian mission to Labrador was discussed, 'on what footing are you with the Methodists? 'They kick us whenever they can,' answered Hutton. George III, the queen, and Benjamin Franklin were among Hutton's acquaintances. On 3 May 1795 Hutton died at Oxted Cottage, near Godstone, Surrey, where he had lived for nearly two years with the Misses Biscoe and Shelley. He was buried in the burying-ground adjoining the chapel at Chelsea. Hutton married at Marrenborn, 3 July 1740, Louise Brandt, a Swiss Moravian, whose grandfather had been advocate of Neuchatel, Zinzendorf performing the ceremony. He left no family. His wife seems to have lapsed occasionally, as on 4 November 1771 'a letter from Brother Hutton, apologising for the uncongregation-like fashion of his wife's gown, was read.' Hutton may be called the founder of the Moravian church in England, although Cominius and other teachers had visited this country before, A portrait of Hutton, with his ear-trumpet, by Richard Cosway, was engraved in mezzotint by John Raphael Smith in 1786; another engraving by W. Wickes is prefixed to Benham's 'Memoir.' Hutton wrote ' An Essay towards giving some just ideas of the Personal Character of Count Zinzendorf ...,' London, 1755, 8vo.\n",

Collier was likely around 12-13 years old in 1607 which was a normal age for apprenticeships in England. Collier accompanied Smith for his first meeting with Powhatan and Pocahontas.\nAccording to contemporary historians, Collier was sent by Smith to learn the language of the Algonquian-speaking Warraskoyack tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy, and later served the colony as an interpreter. He befriended weroance (chief) Tackonekintaco during that period. Collier was held in high esteem by Smith as a respected member of the community.\nDeath\nAccording to Smith's accounts, Collier died in 1622 aged 26-27 due to accidental friendly fire of an English sentinel during the Powhatan Uprising.\nLegacy\nCollier's story has been fictionalized in several children's books and in young adult literature. The 2001 book Surviving Jamestown: The Adventures Of Young Sam Collier by Gail Langer Karwoski provides a fictional account of Collier's journey to the New World and his life in Jamestown.\nCollier is a character in the 2000 book titled 1609: Winter of the Dead by Elizabeth Massie.\nIn 2007, a children's historical semi-fiction book by Candice F. Ransom was published titled Sam Collier and the Founding of Jamestown, which describes Collier's adventures in Virginia.\nA children's book about Collier was written by Elisa Carbone titled Blood in the River, which centers on his travels with John Smith.\n",

He was also a social justice advocate.\nEarly life\nBobelu was born at Zuni Pueblo into a family of artists and farmers. He was educated at the Riverside Indian School in Anadarko, Oklahoma. Bobelu served in the audiovisual services and graphic design division of the U.S. Air Force.\nWork\nBobelu was known for his silversmithing and lapidary jewelry. He considered his work to be a \"tribute to the victims and survivors of suicide and domestic abuse on our Indian reservations.\" His work as an artist was associated with the Santa Fe Indian Market and the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts. His inlaid pieces included turquoise and other stones, fossilized ivory, ironwood, and shell. He worked in a color palette reminiscent of the early 1900s. His work was exhibited in 2010, 2011 and 2012 at the Heard Museum.\nBobelu was a collaborator on the 2018 film, Veiled Lightning, along with Natachee Momaday Gray, Ashley Browning, Tezbah Gaussoin, and others. The film used archival footage, along with interviews and news footage to explore the ways protest movements in the Southwest can support environmental justice and fight oppression and genocide.\nIn 2006, the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian awarded Bobelu with the Goodman Fellowship Award\nHe lived and worked in Santa Fe, New Mexico and at Zuni Pueblo. He was a Zuni tribal elder, and the father of two daughters, and grandfather to 5 grandchildren.\nAdvocacy\nIn addition to his work as a silversmith and jeweler, Bobelu was also a social justice advocate and human rights. He worked as the cultural liaison, environmental advocate and performance coordinator of The Way of the Rain, Inc. (TWOTR), an organization that advocated for environmental issues, and ecosystems, as well as battling against racism, colonialism and missing and murdered Indigenous women and relatives (MMIWR).\nDeath\nBobelu was murdered in 2022. He was given a traditional Zuni wake, and received full U.S. Airforce military honors.\nLegacy\nA 2023 documentary film was made about Bobelu's life and his work fighting against discrimination and adversity. The film was directed by Jaima Chevalier, and was produced by AJ Goldman (Din\u00e9, Taos and Jemez Pueblos) It screened at numerous venues including the New Mexico History Museum and the Santa Fe Film Festival.\n",
    "Welsh Benedictine monk\nJohn Jones, also known as Leander \u00e0 Sancto Martino, (1575 \u2013 17 December 1636) was a Welsh Benedictine monk.\nBiography\nJones was born in 1575. He belonged to a family settled at Llan Wrinach, Brecknockshire, and was connected with the Scudamore family of Kentchurch, Herefordshire. Ralph Weldon asserts that Jones was removed from Wales to England when scarcely a year old (Chronicle of the Benedictine Monke, p.\u00a0100). His parents. who were Protestants, sent him to Merchant Taylors' School, London, in 1584, and there he studied with Lancelot Andrewes and William Juxon, afterwards bishop of London, On 15 October 1591 he was elected a scholar of St John's College, Oxford, where he was chamber-fellow with William Laud. He obtained a fellowship in his college, and was admitted to the degree of B.C.L. on 16 July 1600. 'His mind being much inclined to the Roman religion,' he quit the university, and within a few days of his arrival in London his parents died of the plague. Thereupon Jones left England for Spain, was received into the English Collage at Valladolid, then under the direction of the jesuits, 20 December 1596, and took the college oath on the feast of St. Alban, 1597. In October 1599 he was admitted into the Benedictine abbey of St. Martin at Compostella, and became a monk of that order, taking, in religion, the name of Leander \u00e0 Sancto Martino. He passed brilliantly through his theological studies in the university of Salamanca, was ordained priest, and, after graduating D.D., continued his studies for about six years in Spanish monasteries.\nAlthough ordered to the English mission, Jones acted successively as novice-master at the abbey of St. Remigiua at Rhelms, and at St. Gregory's at Douay. He was also for nearly twenty-five years professor of theology, and taught Hebrew in the college of Marchiennes, or in that of St. Vedast, in the university of Douay. In 1612 he became vicar-general of the Anglo-Spanish Benedictines. When in 1619 the present English Benedictine congregation was formally approved by Pope Paul V, Jones was elected its first president-general for the usual triennial period, and wua re-elected in 1633. According to decrees of the general chapter of the Benedictine congregation, he acted as prior of St. Gregory's at Douay from 1621 to 1628, and from 1629 to 1633. In 1629 he was appointed abbot of Cisniar, and in 1633 received the titular diguity of cathedral prior of Canterbury.\nJones frequently visited England, and enjoyed special protection through the agency of his friends at court. When early in 1634 Urban VIII determined to send an accredited agent to England to open diplomatic relations he chose Jones for the important mission. Jones displayed a general spirit of good sense and moderation, and took the oath of allegiance on 17 December 1634, appending to it a declaration that the pope had no dispensing power in regard to the oath (Clarendon State Papers, 1. 210). In letlers addressed by him to Cardinal Barberini, he sought to refute charges of minimising the Pope's pretensions and the claims of the Catholics. The negotiations led to no practical result. But Francis Harris, a secular priest who had conformed to the established church, deposed in 1643, before the lords' committee appointed to take the examinations in the case of Archbishop Laud, that Father Leander, 'by the common report of papists and priests, both abroad and in England, was very familiar with the said archbishop, and came over on purpose into England ... to negotiate with the said archbishop about matters of religion, to make a reconciliation between the church of Rome and England' (Prynne, Canterburie's Doome, pp.\u00a0411, 412). Laud denied the truth of this accusation.\nJones died in London on 17 December (O.S.) 1636, and was buried in the chapel of the Capuchin friars in Somerset House. Wood describes him as 'the ornament of the English Benedictines in his time,' adding that 'he was a person of extraordinary eloquence generally knowing in all arts and sciences, beloved of all that knew him and his worth, and hated by none but by the puritans and jesuits (Athen\u00e6 Oxon. ed.

    "Tetradrachm marked KAIAP  (\"Caesar Pertinax\")\nPublius Helvius Pertinax the Younger (also Pertinax Minor; 180\u2013212) was a Roman politician, suffect consul of 212 AD and son of Emperor Pertinax. After the latter came to power in 193 AD, the Senate wanted to proclaim Pertinax the Younger as Caesar, but the emperor rejected this proposal. Pertinax the Elder was killed on the 88th day of his reign. His son survived and under Septimius Severus became a flamen of his father's cult, and under Caracalla a suffect consul. He was later executed as a possible contender for Imperial power.\nBiography\nPublius Helvius Pertinax the Younger was the son of Pertinax, a successful military commander in the Roman-Parthian and Marcomannic Wars, and a Provincial Governor of Moesia, Dacia, Syria and Britain. His mother was Flavia Titiana, daughter of the senator Titus Flavius Sulpicianus. A daughter was also born into this family, but is mentioned in only one source, but there is no information about her; even her name is unknown.\nPertinax the Younger first appears in connection with the events of January 193 AD, when his father was proclaimed emperor after the assassination of Commodus. The son of the new emperor was then still a teenager, so historians date his birth to approximately 180 AD. The senators, having proclaimed Pertinax the Elder emperor, wanted to make his wife Augusta and his son Caesar, but these honors were rejected: \"Let him deserve it\", Pertinax said about his son. Nevertheless, coins with his image and the title Caesar were minted for some time in the eastern provinces (in particular, in Egypt).\nDuring the reign of his father, Pertinax the Younger lived in the house of his maternal grandfather and remained a private citizen. At the end of March 193 AD, Emperor Pertinax was killed by the Praetorian guard, but his son's life was spared. The governor of Pannonia Superior, Lucius Septimius Severus declared himself avenger of the deceased emperor, occupied Rome, proclaimed himself emperor and won the civil war. Septimius Severus established the cult of Pertinax and made Pertinax the Younger a flamen (priest) of this cult.\nPertinax the Younger later served as suffect consul (presumably in 212 AD). However, in the same year he was executed by order of Caracalla. According to Julius Capitolinus, the emperor believed Pertinax was seeking power and that he was very popular and therefore dangerous. A mocking joke by Pertinax at Caracalla's expense made in connection with his murder of his brother Geta: Pertinax proposed calling the emperor the agnomen \"Getacus\" analogous to the title \"Germanicus\".\n",
    "American actor\nLeo Thomas Cleary (June 15, 1894 \u2013 April 11, 1955) was an American character actor in radio and film, and a vaudeville comedian and singer, perhaps best known as Dizzy Dean's minor league manager in The Pride of St. Louis, as the Catholic priest in The Red Menace, and as the original Old Ranger on the radio series, Death Valley Days.\nEarly life and career\nBorn and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, Cleary was the only child of Benjamin Francis Cleary and Mary Clair Lyon. In 1909, the family relocated to Southern California, settling in Pasadena.\nNoted for his expert mimicry and mastery of dialects, Cleary initially employed the standard \"Jewface\" portrayal of that era as his signature routine. Billed variously as \"the Hebrew comedian,\" \"the Yiddish Gazotsky,\" \"the funniest Hebrew on the stage,\" and the \"Ghetto kid,\" while also garnering kudos for his singing, Cleary began performing professionally no later than 1917. By 1919, his wife of seven years, soprano Naomi Plant, had joined the act.\nRadio\nIn an interview conducted 14 years after his death, some measure of Cleary's contribution to Lux Radio Theatre's success was provided by former Billboard staffer Dean Owen, who dubbed Cleary the \"pillar  Lux Theatre's stock company.\"\nOn April 20, 1942, Cleary appeared in Lux Radio Theatre's adaptation of the 1941, Oscar-nominated biographical drama, One Foot in Heaven, portraying Preston Thurston, the part played by Gene Lockhart in the film.\nBetween 1935 and 1938, Cleary was part of a popular radio comedy team sometimes known as \"Nuts and Bolts\"\u2014\"Nuts\" being Cleary and \"Bolts\" his fellow vaudeville alumnus, Ken Gillum. In March 1937, the pair went from being heard locally\u2014on programs produced, respectively, in Los Angeles and New York\u2014to being broadcast nationally over the NBC Blue Network.\nOne of Cleary's most substantial non-recurring roles was the protagonist of \"My Brother Abe,\" an episode of the short-lived series Proudly We Hail, featuring a tremendously wealthy centenarian and his impatient heirs; \"Abe\" refers not only to his late, lamented brother, who had died at Gettysburg, but to the like-named late President, with whom he had had the good fortune to correspond.\nFilm\nNotwithstanding a film career confined strictly to small supporting roles, the lion's share uncredited, Cleary did manage, in at least two of the four films in which he received an onscreen credit, to elicit reviewers' acknowledgement of his good work; namely, the 1950 prison drama, State Penitentiary, in which he doubles as the Warden and Narrator, and the 1952 baseball biopic, The Pride of St. Louis, in which Cleary portrays Ed Monroe, Dizzy Dean's minor league manager.\nMiscellany\nIn 1940, Cleary was invited to a gathering of 50 members of the local Rotary Club in Arcadia, California, convened to honor the branch's outgoing president, John Vanderbur, who, in turn, received the brunt of Cleary's \"ribbing,\" much to the amusement of those present.\nFilmography\nPersonal life and death\nFrom May 18, 1912 until his death, Cleary was married to Naomi Aloha Plant.  They had two sons, Jack and Richard. The latter had a brief acting career of his own during the late 1940s and early 50s, most notably with a substantial role in both the original Broadway run and subsequent tour of Stalag 17.\nAs of January 1920, and continuing through at least May of that year, Cleary owned the company, Leo's Auto Painting Shop, offering \"first class work\" and \"moderate prices\".\nJudging from an article published by The Pasadena Post in March 1920 (dubbing him \"the famous Elk comedian\"), Cleary was, at the very least, a member of the Elks Lodge for very near his entire adult life.\nOn April 11, 1955, Cleary died of kidney failure at Van Nuys Valley Hospital, Survived by his mother, wife, sons and four grandchildren, Cleary's cremated remains are interred at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.\nNotes\n^ Presumably akin to the later Celebrity \"Roasts,\" the latter term evidently not having been coined until almost a decade later.\n",
    "River in Bulgaria\nThe Mladezhka reka (Bulgarian: \u041c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430) is a 40\u00a0km long river in southeastern Bulgaria, a left tributary of the Veleka, which flows into the Black Sea.\nThe river takes its source at an altitude of 486\u00a0m some 800\u00a0m southeast of the summit of Batak Cheshma (509\u00a0m) on the Bulgaria\u2013Turkey border. Along its whole course it flows in a deep densely forested valley, initially in direction northeast until the village of Mladezhko and then in direction southeast until its mouth. The Mladezhka reka flows into the Veleka at an altitude of 96 m about 2 m east of the historic locality of Petrova Niva.\nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 232\u00a0km2, or 23.3% of the Veleka's total. The river has typically Mediterranean characteristics with high water in February and low water in August. The average flow at the crossing of the first class I-9 road is 1.01\u00a0m3/s.\nThe Mladezhka reka flows entirely in Burgas Province. There one settlement along its course, the village of Mladezhko in Malko Tarnovo Municipality. Its waters are among the cleanest in Bulgaria and are not diverted for economic purposes. Its whole valley is part of the Strandzha Nature Park and its lower course is located in the Paroria protected area, which sheltered an important monastic community in the 14th century during the Second Bulgarian Empire. The historic locality of Petrova Niva at the mouth of the Mladezhka reka was the starting point of the 1903 Bulgarian Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in the Strandzha region.\nGallery\nCitations\n^ a b c d e Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria 1980, p.\u00a0144\n^ Speake, Graham (2018).

    "German military engineer\nChristian Lilly (died 1738) was a German military engineer.\nBiography\nLilly commenced his military career in the service of the Dukes of Zelle and Hanover in 1685, and was under the command of Prince Frederick Augustus and of Lieutenant-general Chauvet. He served several campaigns against the Turks in Hungary, and was present at the battle of Grau and the sieges of Neuhausel, Caschaw, Polack, and Buda (1683\u20136). In 1688 he entered the service of William III, by whom he was naturalised as an Englishman. He served in Scotland in 1689, and in Ireland during the greater part of the war. He was posted to King William's Dutch train of artillery, and served first under Count Solmes at the battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690, and afterwards under General Ginkell at the first siege of Athlone and the first siege of Limerick, raised on 27 August. On 3 September 1690 he was appointed ensign in Lieutenant-general Douglas's regiment, and quartermaster-general to the grand detachment of the army commanded by that officer. He again served under Ginkell at Ballymore in June 1691, was director of the approaches in the second siege of Athlone during the same month, took part in the battle of Aughrim on 11 July, was engineer at the short siege of Galway which followed, and during August and September at the second siege of Limerick, which ended the war.\nOn 1 May 1692 Lilly was appointed engineer of the office of ordnance, and was sent with the train of artillery upon an expedition under the Duke of Leinster, to make a descent upon the French coast, but this proving unsuccessful, a descent was made upon Flanders instead. By royal warrant of 4 August 1692 he was appointed engineer at 10s. a day to accompany a train of brass ordnance and mortars to the West Indies. In 1693 he was sent with the expedition under Sir Francis Wheler to Barbados, Martinique, the Leeward Islands, New England, and Newfoundland, where besides his post of engineer he had chief command of the artillery train, and was captain of a company of foot. On his return home he was appointed on 30 October 1693 captain in Colonel Lillingston's regiment of foot, and was sent into garrison at Plymouth.\nOn 12 October 1694 the Earl of Romney, master-general of the ordnance, appointed him engineer and to command the train of artillery for the West Indies. He went out with Colonel Lillingston in 1695, and served at the sieges of Cape Fran\u00e7ois and Port \u00e0 Paix in Hispaniola, which were taken from the French, and he was afterwards stationed at Jamaica. The town of Kingston, Jamaica, was built on plans prepared by Lilly after the old town of Port Royal had been destroyed by earthquake in 1692. On 19 May 1696 he was appointed fireworker to the artillery train, and the same year was sent to Cuba to report on the situation and strength of the Havana, after which he returned to England. On 17 November he was appointed chief engineer of Jamaica at 20s. a day. He repaired the fortifications of Port Royal, and strengthened the fortifications of other parts of the island under Sir William Beeston. In accordance with a warrant of the governor, dated 1 May 1698, Lilly proceeded with the squadron under Admiral Benbow to examine the Spanish ports on the coast of Peru. He visited Portobello, Carthagena, and the Scottish settlements, &c., and returning to England laid reports upon the capabilities of these ports for defence before the king.\nWhen on 24 May 1698 the artillery trains employed in Flanders and at sea were dismissed and a peace train ordered to be formed, Lilly was appointed one of the six engineers at 100l. per annum from 1 May 1698. By royal warrant of 28 June 1701 the king appointed him third engineer of England, his commission to date from 1 July, with a salary of 150l. per annum.\nOn 14 August the same year he was again appointed chief engineer at Jamaica, and accompanied Brigadier-general William Selwyn to the West Indies. He made surveys of Port Royal and other harbours of Jamaica, and was also engaged in repairing and improving the fortifications. On 10 November 1703 Acting Governor Thomas Handasyd appointed him lieutenant-colonel of artillery in Jamaica. On 4 May 1704 the board of ordnance appointed him chief engineer in the West Indies, and instructed him to fortify the island of Barbados under the orders of General Sir Bevil Granville, the governor. On 29 January 1705 Sir Bevill appointed him colonel of artillery at Barbados. In 1707 he was sent to Antigua, Nevis, and St. Kitts, to inquire under General Park into the military condition of those islands. He sent home projects and surveys showing what he considered to be necessary for their defence. On the completion of this duty he returned to Barbados, and resumed the superintendence of the construction of defence works there. On 12 May 1709 the board of ordnance appointed him keeper of the naval ordnance stores at Barbados.\nIn the summer of 1711, under a warrant of the board of ordnance dated 6 ",
    "Jean-Claude Yon, born Paris, 22 February 1966 is a French academic and historian. He has specialised in the world of 19th century theatre and opera, notably the work of Scribe and Offenbach. He is professor at the Universit\u00e9 de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\nCareer\nYon entered the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Fontenay-Saint-Cloud in 1987, obtaining a master's degree in contemporary history with his study Les notaires parisiens sous le Second Empire (Parisian notaries during the Second Empire) which went on to win the Prix Favard de Langlade offered by the Institut international d\u2019histoire du notariat in 1993. His doctoral thesis examined Eug\u00e8ne Scribe, la fortune et la libert\u00e9 (Eug\u00e8ne Scribe, destiny and freedom) and was defended in January 1994 at the universit\u00e9 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne. Along with Jean-Christophe Keck, Robert Pourvoyer, Peter Hawig and Alain Fraison he was involved in the creation of the Offenbach Edition Keck, a new Offenbach critical edition to be published by Boosey & Hawkes and Bote & Bock. Yon, in his 2000 study, notably advanced understanding of Offenbach's place within the sociological history of his times.\nPr\u00e9sident of the scientific committee of the 'Unit\u00e9 de formation et de recherche' (training and research unit) in Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universit\u00e9 de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (November 2006 to June 2010), he was elected in June 2009 to the council of UFR, then in October 2010 to the council of the Institut d\u2019\u00e9tudes culturelles (IEC) then the council of the Institut d\u2019\u00e9tudes culturelles et internationales (IECI).\nProfessor of contemporary history at the Universit\u00e9 de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (2012), in 2014 he became the Director of its Centre d\u2019histoire culturelle des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s contemporaines (Centre for cultural history of contemporary society). He was also responsible for projects with the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay from 1992 to 2006 and co-ordinator of twelve exhibition brochures from 1993 to 2000.\nAs 'Historien sp\u00e9cialiste de l'op\u00e9ra, \u00e9crivain, professeur des universit\u00e9s' Yon was awarded Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in the summer of 2021.\nPublications\nYon's preference is to work in collaboration with other fields \"in a multidisciplinary approach and to work with literature, musicology, language and theatrical studies specialists\". He believes that approaches can complement and enrich each other and at the heart of such a collaboration the historian must \"op\u00e9rer la mise en contexte des \u0153uvres\" (contextualize the works).

    "Scottish playwright\nNot to be confused with Archibald MacLaren.\nArchibald Maclaren (2 March 1755 \u2013 1826) was a Scottish playwright.\nBiography\nMaclaren was born in the highlands of Scotland on 2 March 1755, entered the army, and served in the American war under Generals Moore and Clinton. His regiment returned to Scotland to recruit, and in 1783 Mr. Jackson's company produced his farce of the 'Coup de Main' at Edinburgh. On the conclusion of the war he was discharged, and joined Ward's itinerant troop of players at Montrose. He is said to have been a bad exponent of English parts, in consequence of his strong Scottish accent, but in Scottish, Irish, and French characters he was not unsuccessful.\nIn 1794 he enlisted as a sergeant in the Dumbartonshire Highlanders, and went with them to Guernsey, where he was engaged to act as prompter in the theatre, and where several of his pieces were performed. Thence his regiment proceeded to Ireland, and took part in the suppression of the rebellion. While in Ireland he wrote another farce, 'What News from Bantry Bay?' but it was not immediately produced, from fear of the United Irishmen. After the battle of Vinegar Hill he was discharged and went to London, where his dramatic writings afforded precarious support to his family till his death in 1826.\nThe following is a list of his works: \nI.

    "American beauty pageant winner (born 1995)\nSavannah Mar\u02bbi Gankiewicz (born November 28, 1995) is an American model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss USA 2023. Previously crowned Miss Hawaii USA 2023, Gankiewicz placed as the first runner-up at Miss USA, and took over the title after its original winner Noelia Voigt resigned in May 2024. Gankiewicz is the fifth woman from Hawaii to be crowned Miss USA.\nEarly life and education\nGankiewicz was born on November 28, 1995, on Oahu to parents Yvienne Tagorda Peterson and Mark Gankiewicz; her mother is from Maui and of Filipina descent, while her father is of Polish and Vietnamese descent. Her mother had a background in pageantry, having been crowned Mrs. Maui and serving as a director for the Miss Maui Filipina pageant. Gankiewicz spent the first six years of her life with her family on Maui, and later lived between Maui and Stephenson, Virginia, where her father relocated.\nGankiewicz was educated in Virginia, attending Sherando High School in Frederick County, Virginia and George Mason University in Fairfax County, Virginia. She later returned to Hawaii at age 21, settling in Kihei, Hawaii on Maui, where she began working as a professional model and a marketing coordinator at The Agency Maui.\nPageantry\nGankiewicz began competing in pageantry due to a desire to improve her public speaking skills and to develop a platform to promote self-love to other women, and was encouraged by her mother. Gankiewicz later moved to the Philippines to model and competed in the Filipino beauty pageant Mutya ng Pilipinas 2017, where she was a finalist and received the title of Mutya ng Pilipinas Overseas Filipino Communities for representing the Filipino-Hawaiian community. Following the pageant, she continued to live in the Philippines to work as a model for over a year.\nAfter a break from pageantry, Gankiewicz registered as a contestant for the Miss Hawaii USA 2023 pageant in January 2023, competing as Miss Wailea. She went on to win the title on her first attempt, and also was crowned Miss Photogenic. Aged 27 at the time of her win, Gankiewicz opted to compete in her final year of age eligibility as she had wanted to wait until she felt ready for the responsibilities of being a state titleholder. With her win, Gankiewicz became the first woman from Maui to be crowned Miss Hawaii USA in over 20 years.\nMiss USA 2023\nMain article: Miss USA 2023\nAs Miss Hawaii USA, Gankiewicz became a contestant for Miss USA 2023, representing Hawaii. The competition was held on September 29, 2023, in Reno, Nevada and aired on The CW. During the state costume portion of the pageant, Gankiewicz wore a costume paying tribute to the victims of the 2023 wildfire in Lahaina, Hawaii on her home island of Maui, for which she won the Best State Costume award. Gankiewicz ultimately placed as the first runner-up in the competition, behind winner Noelia Voigt of Utah, and additionally won the Best in Interview award. Gankiewicz later crowned Breea Yamat as her successor at the Miss Hawaii USA 2024 pageant in April 2024.\nIn May 2024, Voigt announced that she was resigning her title as Miss USA, citing her struggles with mental health. Later that day, it was reported in the Hawaiian media that Gankiewicz had been asked to take over the Miss USA title. Due to pageant protocol, the first runner-up is asked to step in to fulfill the duties of Miss USA should the winner be unable to, and on May 9, it was announced that Gankiewicz would assume the title of Miss USA 2023. Gankiewicz was later officially crowned as Miss USA 2023 by Josh Green, the governor of Hawaii, in a ceremony held on May 15 in the neighborhood of Waikiki in Honolulu. Following this, she became the fifth woman from Hawaii to be crowned Miss USA.\nNotes\n^ Gankiewicz was originally first runner-up, but became Miss USA after the original titleholder, Noelia Voigt, resigned the title.\n",
    "\nBuilding in Velk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n\u0160palk\u016fv obchodn\u00ed d\u016fm (English: '\u0160palek Department Store') is a modernist commercial building with apartments in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Czech Republic. It was built at the beginning of the 20th century by architect Vladim\u00edr Fultner for the textile merchant V\u00e1clav J. \u0160palek on the square Velk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed.\nAlthough the building has been referred to as a department store since its inception, it has always been primarily a residential building, with only its ground and second floors serving for commercial purposes. This is typical for Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, where civic amenities were located on the ground floors of residential buildings due to the city's former military fortification status until 1893. Multi-story exclusively commercial buildings, such as Breda Department Store in Opava, did not emerge until the 1970s in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9.\nHistory\nMerchant V\u00e1clav J. \u0160palek owned a house at the corner of Velk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed and Klicperova ulice, which burned down in July 1910. \u0160palek commissioned architect Vladim\u00edr Fultner to design a new building. Due to the narrow original medieval plot, Fultner decided to orient the main fa\u00e7ade of the new building not towards the square but towards Klicperova street.\n\u0160palek Department Store was designed as a five-storey corner house with two entrances and an ornamental fa\u00e7ade. Despite facing critique from Klub Za starou Prahu (Club for old Prague) and the architect Jan Kot\u011bra, who regarded the proportions of the construction unreasonable, the design was accepted and built by Josef Jihlavec in 1911. In the 1930s, the building was taken over by the company Ba\u0165a. The house was declared a cultural monument in 1958.\nIn the 21st century, the building was unused for several years and started to decay but a total reconstruction of the house and its conversion into living spaces took place in 2020.\nArchitecture\nThe house has five floors. The fa\u00e7ade towards the square is axially symmetrical, with an arcade in the ground floor and three large windows on the first floor. The higher floors are distinguished by a risalit with each storey containing five narrow windows. The roof forms a mansarda from which a dormer emerges. At the ends of the fa\u00e7ade, there are two corner towers.\n",

Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 3,659 \u00b1 24\u00a0km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 54.0 \u00b1 3.8 Mpc (\u223c176 million ly). NGC 3799 was discovered by British astronomer John Herschel in 1832.\nNGC 3799 and NGC 3800 are two gravitationally interacting galaxies and appear in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the symbol Arp 83. Halton Arp describes these as an example of galaxies by presenting a bridge of matter between them and having a high surface gloss.\nThe luminosity class of NGC 3799 is II and it has a broad HI line. According to the SIMBAD database, NGC 3799 is a LINER galaxy, that is to say a galaxy whose nucleus presents an emission spectrum characterized by broad lines of weakly ionized atoms.\nTo date, a non-redshift measurement gives a distance of approximately 47,000 Mpc (\u223c153 million ly). This value is far outside the Hubble distance values. Note, however, that it is with the average value of independent measurements, when they exist, that the NASA/IPAC database calculates the diameter of a galaxy.\nNGC 3800 group\nNGC 3799 is part of a group of galaxies that has at least 16 members which make up what is commonly known as the NGC 3800 group.

    "16th and 17th-century leader of the Warraskoyack tribe\nTackonekintaco (birth year unknown\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091620s) was a 16th and 17th-century leader of the Warraskoyack tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy, in what is now the U.S. state of Virginia. \nLife and rule\nTackonekintaco was a respected leader within the Warraskoyack tribe. By the late 1590s, Tackonekintaco had become the new weroance of the tribe. The main village of the tribe was located in present-day Smithfield, Virginia. The tribe had at least 40 warriors and over 135 tribal members.\nIn December 1608, Tackonekintaco was visited by captain John Smith, with whom he had established friendly relations and gave corn to on an earlier trip. He cautioned Smith against continuing his journey in search of lost colonists, primarily due to the threat of violence from Powhatan. John Smith wrote that Tackonekintaco provided him with \"good counsel\" and he told the chief that he had his \"perpetual love\" and friendship. Upon Smith's departure, he left his page Samuel Collier with Tackonekintaco to learn the Algonquian language, and Tackonekintaco provided some local villagers as guides to accompany Michael Sicklemore on his journey south into the Chowanoc country. Tackonekintaco befriended Collier who lived with the tribe during that period.\nAs weroance, Tackonekintaco controlled the tribe's surplus stock of corn which was of great interest to colonists.\nCapture by Virginia Company\nAfter Smith's departure from Virginia, Tackonekintaco's time in leadership was met with threats of coercion and violence by colonists. In the summer of 1610, Tackonekintaco and his son, Tangoit were captured by colonists led by Christopher Newport, and held as hostages. To receive his freedom and his son's, he was forced to contract with the Virginia Company to exchange 500 bushels of wheats, beans, and peas for an indefinite quantity of copper, beads, and hatchets from the tribe. When Tackonekintaco refused to deliver the provisions, Governor of Virginia Baron De La Warr ordered his troops to attack their tribe and burn their main village. Tackonekintaco spotted the troops coming downriver, and gave the signal for his people to flee the village and take refuge in surrounding forests.\nIn 1623 in the aftermath of the Indian massacre of 1622, the tribe was attacked and later, an English fort was built within its borders.\nDeath\nRecords indicate that Tackonekintaco died c.\u20091620s and was the last recorded weroance of the tribe.\n",
    "English major-general in the British and Portuguese services\nSir George Allan Madden CB (3 January 1771 \u2013 8 December 1828) was an English army officer in the British and Portuguese services.\nBiography\nMadden was the eighth son and fifteenth and youngest child of James Madden, of Cole Hill House, Fulham, Middlesex. He was born in London 3 January 1771, and was baptised at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. After attending private schools, and accepting an engagement on trial in a merchant's office from September 1787, his father, in February 1788, obtained for him a commission in the army. He was appointed cornet in the 14th light dragoons in Ireland, 14 March 1789. On 30 June 1791 he purchased (from Arthur Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington, then promoted in the 58th foot) a lieutenancy in the 12th or Prince of Wales's light dragoons, in which regiment he became captain 29 June 1793 and major 25 December 1800. After serving several years in Ireland, he embarked with his regiment at Cork in September 1793 for Ostend. Contrary winds drove them back, and the regiment was counter-ordered to Toulon, then just relieved by Admiral Hood. Adverse winds and defective supplies caused innumerable delays, and Toulon had been evacuated before the regiment arrived. Madden was with the mounted portion of the regiment, which was refused permission to land at Leghorn. At Porto Ferrajo, island of Elba, no forage could be found. At length, at the invitation of Pope Pius VI, it was put ashore at Civita Vecchia, 6 March 1794, the surviving horses, it is said (Services of Colonel G. A. Madden, p. 3), having then been nine months ashipboard. During the stay of the troops at Civita Vecchia gold medals were presented by the pope to the officers. It appears from the exergue that the medals were originally struck to commemorate the restoration of the port; but a subsequent order of the general commanding directed them to be constantly worn by the recipients, out of respect to the memory of the ill-fated pontiff. Pictures of the reception of the officers at Rome by Pius VI were placed at South Kensington, and in the officers mess 12th lancers. The regiment left Civita Vecchia in May 1794; took part in the operations in Corsica ending with the fall of Calvi in August, and was ordered home in November the same year. Madden's troop was shipwrecked on the coast of Spain. The men and horses were saved, and were assigned quarters by the Spanish government in one of the Puntales forts, near Cadiz, where they remained until a ship was sent out from England to fetch them home in August 1795 (ib. p. 4).\nMadden's conduct was warmly approved by the British authorities at Gibraltar. In January 1797 he went with his regiment to Portugal, and was stationed three years at Lisbon. In 1801 the regiment accompanied Sir Ralph Abercromby to Egypt, and took part in the battle before Alexandria and the advance on Cairo. During the latter, Madden, the youngest field officer of cavalry present with the army, was sent by Lord Hutchinson with detachments of the 12th and 26th (afterwards 23rd) light dragoons, on special service towards Rosetta. Throughout the march on Cairo Madden's activity and intelligence won Hutchinson's high approbation.\nThere was much want of harmony between Madden and the officer in temporary command of the regiment, Colonel Browne, afterwards General Browne-Clayton, K.C. (see Gent. Mag. 1845, ii. 197). An angry altercation on duty matters had taken place between them (see Trial of G. A. Madden, London, 1803, pp. 37\u20138), and in August 1801 Madden charged Browne with having committed perjury in a recent court-martial on a captain of the 12th dragoons. In consequence Madden was arraigned before a general court-martial on a charge of unofficerlike conduct and disrespect to his commanding officer. The court-martial, of which Major-general (Sir) John Moore was president, and Colonels John Stuart (of Maida), Alan Cameron of Lochiel, and other famous officers were members, was held in the camp before Alexandria, 31 August 1801. Two editions of the proceedings were printed. The court found Madden guilty of the charge, and adjudged him to be dismissed the service. Lord Hutchinson refused to confirm the proceedings. Eventually, Madden, who was very popular with his brother-officers, was sent home, and permitted to retire by the sale of his commissions (Lond. Gaz. 26 May 1802), all of which he had purchased. When the 12th light dragoons arrived in England three years later, a duel took place between Madden and Blunden, a major of the regiment, who had taken a part against Madden in the quarrel. Madden, after receiving his adversary's shot, fired in the air, and the matter ended.\nMadden was on terms of the closest intimacy with the margrave and margravine of Anspac, and lived with the family at Benham, Berkshire, and Brandenburgh House, Hammersmith, during the greater part of 1804\u20135.

    "Football club\nAskania Bernburg is a German football club based in the city of Bernburg, located in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The club was founded on March 15, 1909, and has a rich history in regional football competitions.\nHistory\nEarly years\nAskania Bernburg was established in 1909 as FC Askania 09 Bernburg. The club initially played friendly matches against other local teams before joining competitive leagues. In the early years, Askania Bernburg primarily participated in local and regional competitions in Saxony-Anhalt.\nPost-War era\nFollowing World War II, Askania Bernburg faced challenges due to the political and social changes in the region. The club managed to rebuild and resumed its football activities in regional leagues. Throughout the post-war era, Askania Bernburg competed in various divisions of German football.\nRise to prominence\nIn the 1990s, Askania Bernburg experienced success and achieved several promotions, climbing up the German football league system. The club reached its peak in the early 2000s when it competed in the NOFV-Oberliga Nord, the fourth tier of German football at the time.\nRecent years\nIn recent years, Askania Bernburg has participated in regional leagues, including the Landesliga Sachsen-Anhalt. The club has maintained a presence in regional football and continues to compete against other teams in Saxony-Anhalt.\nOn July 25, 1952, the state parliament of Saxony-Anhalt passed the \u201cLaw on the further democratization, structure and functioning of state bodies in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.\u201d This meant the dissolution of the previous state into the districts of Magdeburg and Halle and thus the formation of the Bernburg district in the Halle district. The result was the definition of new leagues. The first team of BSG Empor Bernburg became a founding member of the third-class Halle district league, which consists of a total of 12 teams. Below the district league there were the district and district classes, above the upper league and the DS league.\nIn 1952 the club was renamed BSG Chemie Bernburg. As early as 1954 he was relegated from the district league. When competitive sports were separated from popular sports in 1954, all sports associations except SV Medizin and SV Post founded a sports club (SC), sometimes several. The chemistry, glass and ceramics union sector founded SC Chemie Halle-Leuna, today's SV Halle, in what was then the district town of Halle (Saale).\nIn 1957, BSG Chemie Bernburg, together with Stahl Helbra, managed to return to the district's top division, which this time was held for nine years until 1966. The best results were the runner-up championships won in 1959 and 1963 behind Motor Aschersleben and HSG Wissenschaft Halle, with which Chemie Bernburg narrowly failed to gain promotion to the Second GDR League.\nIn the period that followed, it was no longer possible to return to the district league; the BSG only appeared in the Halle district league until 1991. In 1990 the club renamed itself Askania Bernburg. From 1994 to 2014, Askania Bernburg operated consistently between the Saxony-Anhalt Association League and the state league. In 2014, as runners-up, they celebrated promotion to the fifth-class Oberliga Nordost and benefited from the renunciation of the champions BSV Halle-Amendorf\nStadium\nAskania Bernburg plays its home matches at the Sparkassen Arena.\nSee also\nList of football clubs in Germany\n",
    "Football club in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany\nFootball club\nFSV Barleben 1911 is a football club from the unified municipality of Barleben in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. The home of the club is the sports field at Barleber Anger. The biggest success in the club's history is the winning of the national championship title 2014/15.\nThe first team has been playing in the Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt since 2018 after the voluntary withdrawal from the southern relay of the Oberliga Nordost and has been trained by Christoph Grabinski since July 2021.\nPrehistory\nThe chronicle of Barleber football goes back to 1911, when the first sports club with a football section was founded. In the early years, however, the association did not appear nationwide. After the end of the Second World War, the club was dissolved in 1945 at the instigation of the Soviet occupying power, but sports activities continued to exist. In the course of the reorganization of company sports on a production basis, the BSG VEM Barleben was created in 1948, a company sports community, which was joined by the sports community formed in 1945. In the following years, the club, renamed BSG Motor Barleben in 1950, achieved some success. For example, they belonged to the Bezirksliga Magdeburg from 1952 to 1954 and 1956/1957. From 1957 until the reunification of both German states, Barleben played continuously in the district class for many years, but in 1987/88 he was relegated to the district league. With the end of the GDR, the BSG Motor Barleben was refounded into SG Motor Barleben.\nAfter the introduction of the DFB league system in East Germany, SG Motor Barleben therefore found itself at district level for the 1990/91 season. In the mid-1990s, Barleber football managed to return to FSA level with the promotion to the state class.\nHistory\nIn 1997, the footballers went their own way and left SG Motor Barleben and founded their own club. In tradition to the first Barleben football team, they called the club FSV Barleben 1911. At the end of the 2003/04 season, the FSV was relegated from the state class after long-standing affiliation. Only the absence of relegated in the Ohrekreisliga prevented the further decline of the club in 2005. It was not until 2008 that the Red-Blacks found they back in national football, whereby with a new promotion they even succeeded in the march into the now seventh-class state league. Although the club had to accept the direct relegation, the immediate re-promotion to the Landesliga Nord followed in the year of the 100th anniversary. After the placements three and four, FSV Barleben rose undefeated to the Verbandsliga Saxony-Anhalt with first place in 2014. In 2015, winning the state championship of Saxony-Anhalt succeeded in the first promotion to the Oberliga, so that the club was active for the first time in the fifth highest division of the DFB league system in the 2015/16 season. In the new league, the team of coach Mario Middendorf with ninth place already managed the safe class preservation with a few match days before the end of the season, which with a 13. Place was also realized in the following season. After the third season in the Oberliga, the first under coach J\u00f6rn Schulz, and the renewed sporting class retention, the club withdrew to the Verbandsliga for economic reasons.\nStadium\nThe club usually plays its home games on the sports field at Barleber Anger, which has a lawn (main square) and an artificial turf field. However, if games are due that require a higher level of security or if more than 1,000 spectators are expected to play at home, they will not take place on the home sports field.\nPlayers and coaches of the men's team\nSaxony-Anhalt Cup\nSuccesses\nHall district master district of B\u00f6rde (2007/08)\nDistrict Master District of B\u00f6rde (2007/08)\nChampion State Class 4 (2008/09)\nChampion State Class 2 (2010/11)\nChampion Landesliga Nord (2013/14)\nNational Champion Saxony-Anhalt (2014/15)\nExternal links\nwww.fsvbarleben.de\nHighlights: Highlights: FSV Barleben - 1.

    "Nepalese soldier (born 1902\nNandlal Thapa wearing his medals, including the George Cross.\nNandlal Thapa, GC (12 July 1902 \u2013 27 June 1987) was a Nepalese soldier in the British Indian Army who received the George Cross, the highest award bestowed by the British government for non-operational gallantry. As of April 2024, Thapa is the only Nepalese person to have been awarded the George Cross.\nBiography\nThapa was born in western Nepal. He enlisted in the 2 Bn, 8th Gurkha Rifles in December 1920. He was married and had a son.\nGeorge Cross action and citation\nAt the rank of Naik, Nandlal Thapa was initially awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal (EGM) for the extraordinary bravery he displayed in conducting rescue operations right after the massive Quetta Earthquake of 31 May 1935. Lance Naik Chitrabahadur Gurung of 1/8 Gurkha Rifles was another recipient of the EGM for rescue operations in the same episode.   \nNandlal Thapa's EGM citation reads as the following: \n\"The KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the Award of the Medal of the Military Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire to the undermentioned for services rendered in connection with the recent earthquake in Baluchistan:\u2013 For Gallantry. No. 7506 Naik Nandlal Thapa, 2nd Battalion, 8th Gurkha Rifles, Indian Army. Naik Nandlal Thapa formed part of the leading detachment of the Battalion which was conveyed by Mechanical Transport from the Lines to Quetta City. There was no time for the party to collect tools. On arrival in the City the detachment was split up into small parties and worked with their hands for three hours, prior to the distribution of tools, extricating injured men and women from the d\u00e9bris. The area in which they worked was the junction of Bruce Road and Colvin Road, one of the parts most damaged by the earthquake. During this period minor shocks frequently occurred, causing further falls of masonry in the houses in which they were digging with their hands. Working with the party this Non-commissioned Officer showed conspicuous bravery in the manner in which he entered tottering buildings in search of living people and in the work and initiative he displayed in removing them. As a result of his disregard of danger ten people were rescued alive at considerable risk. He fully realised the risks he ran, but was always ready to enter any building where there was any possibility of anyone remaining alive. His conduct was a very fine example of courage and energy at a critical time.\"\nIn September 1940, following the creation of the George Cross, he was awarded a George Cross in place of the EGM.

    "Irish journalist and lottery broker\nJohn Magee (died November 1809) was an Irish journalist and lottery broker.\nBiography\nMagee became proprietor and printer in Dublin of \u2018Magee's Weekly Packet\u2019 in 1777, and of the \u2018Dublin Evening Post\u2019 at the beginning of 1779. Both papers were printed at 20 Dame Street. From the first these journals, and especially the \u2018Evening Post,\u2019 opposed the government measures, and showed whig sympathies, but during 1789 the proprietor's name became particularly prominent on account of a series of attacks made on the notorious Francis Higgins, a journalist in the government pay, and on other persons, among whom was John Scott, Lord Earlsfort, afterwards Earl of Clonmell, chief justice of the king's bench, Higgins's personal friend. Magee also charged Richard Daly, patentee and manager of the Crow Street Theatre, with tricking the former patentee out of his patent and with making money, in conjunction with Higgins, by dishonest means. Reflections on the character of Thomas Brennan, at that time on the staff of the \u2018Freeman's Journal,\u2019 but formerly a writer in Magee's own employ, and on a lady named Tracey, who was a ward of Higgins, and then lived with her aunt in Brennan's house at Kilmacud, appeared at the same time in the \u2018Dublin Evening Post.\u2019 On the affidavits of these persons fiats were issued by Lord Earlsfort in June requiring Magee to find bail to the amount of 7,800l., pending actions for libel. This he was unable to do, especially as it was requisite that the sureties should declare themselves worth twice the amount of the bail. He was consequently confined in a spunging-house. He continued while in confinement to conduct his newspapers, and Nicholas Lawless, first lord Cloncurry, sought to alleviate the hardships of his imprisonment.\nOn 3 July 1789 the trial of Magee for the libel on Higgins began before Lord Earlsfort. Magee was not present at the opening, a habeas corpus having been refused, and he was unrepresented by counsel. An order to bring up the body of defendant was, however, at length granted by the chief justice; but Magee, when he arrived, protested against the empanelling of the jury and the opening of the trial in his absence, and, refusing to plead, was at his own request ordered back into custody. No defence was offered. But Arthur Browne and other lawyers in court protested against the excessive fiats as unconstitutional (Browne, Arguments before King's Bench on admitting John Magee to Common Bail, 1790). Magee's charges were in popular opinion well founded. The jury at first brought in a verdict of \u2018guilty of printing and publishing,\u2019 but were sent back by the chief justice, and then returned a general verdict of guilty. Lord Earlsfort, who refused them a copy of the record, declared that \u2018had they given any other verdict they would have acted in a manner shameful to themselves and disgraceful to their country.\u2019 No good report of the trial is in existence. On his conviction he was set at liberty pending the pronouncement of his sentence. On 10 July 1789 the Dublin Volunteers passed a resolution approving \u2018the firm conduct of our worthy fellow-citizen in a late transaction,\u2019 and Hamilton Rowan wrote to Magee in his confinement offering to subscribe twenty-five guineas to a public subscription which it was proposed to raise in his behalf. Magee, however, refused to accept anything. On 30 July, Brennan, one of the men libelled by Magee, entered Magee's house and destroyed the furniture. He was arrested and tried on sworn information, but was acquitted.\nMeanwhile, Magee continued to lampoon Higgins and Lord Clonmell, and the \u2018Freeman's Journal,\u2019 which belonged to Higgins, replied with equal scurrility. To revenge himself upon the lord chief justice he arranged for Lammas day, in honour of the Prince of Wales's birthday, what he called a \u2018Bra Pleasura\u2019 in a field adjoining Lord Clonmell's house at Dunleary, or \u2018Fiat Hill.\u2019 Lord Cloncurry was an eye-witness, and an account is also given by Sir Jonah Barrington. A mob of several thousands assembled. A derisive programme of sports was performed. Dogs danced in barristers' uniforms, and asses raced with jockeys in wigs; and finally, in an \u2018Olympic pig-hunt,\u2019 the people followed the animals into Lord Clonmell's grounds and did much damage. The \u2018Dublin Evening Post\u2019 of 25 August announced an adjournment of further proceedings to 7 Sept., pending the arrival of the chief justice. On 27 August it declared that \u2018there would be thirty thousand men at Dunleary.\u2019 The chief justice, according to an informant of Fitzpatrick, in great alarm implored the viceroy to summon the privy council and obtain a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. The result was that Magee was arrested on 3 September by a warrant of Sir Samuel Bradstreet, judge of the king's bench, and, being unable to give heavy bail to keep the peace for five years, was committed to Newgate. On 29 October he was liberated in bail for 4,000l. On 3 October a petitio",
    "Irish newspaper proprietor and spy\nFrancis Higgins, also called the \"Sham Squire\", (1746 \u2013 19 January 1802) was an Irish newspaper proprietor and spy.\nBiography\nHiggins was the son of humble parents, who migrated from Downpatrick in Ulster to Dublin. Higgins passed his early years in menial employments, became an attorney's clerk, was converted to Protestantism, and, by practising gross deception, married a respectable lady, whose relatives in 1766 prosecuted him for fraud. Higgins was convicted, and was for some time imprisoned. To this incident was attributed Higgins's sobriquet of the \u2018Sham Squire.\u2019 After his release he formed lucrative connections with lottery-offices and gambling-houses. He was admitted an attorney at Dublin in 1780, and secured the posts of deputy-coroner and under-sheriff. Higgins became owner of the newspaper styled \u2018The Freeman's Journal,\u2019 which, with his own services, he placed at the disposal of the administrators of the government at Dublin. Thenceforth Higgins continuously assailed in his paper the opponents of the government, and Henry Grattan denounced in parliament the mendacities and unscrupulous conduct of the journal. In 1788 Higgins was appointed a magistrate by Lord-chancellor Lifford. John Magee, in his paper, the \u2018Dublin Evening Post,\u2019 published numerous satires in prose and verse on Higgins and his associate, Richard Daly. Magee exposed Higgins's antecedents, and denounced him as a venal journalist, a corrupt magistrate, and a proprietor of houses of ill-repute. In 1790 Higgins prosecuted Magee for libel in the court of king's bench. Through Higgins's alleged influence with John Scott, earl of Clonmel, lord chief justice, he obtained, by authority of that court, writs styled \u2018fiats,\u2019 under which the defendants were liable to imprisonment till they found surety for the entire amount claimed as damages. These proceedings formed the subject of discussion in the House of Commons of Ireland. Lord-chancellor FitzGibbon removed Higgins from the magistracy in 1791, and in 1794 he was struck off the roll of attorneys. In 1795 he warned the government of a projected attack on the new lord-lieutenant, Lord Camden. Through the under-secretary, Edward Cooke, with whom he had had previous relations, Higgins secretly communicated to the Irish government in 1798 particulars as to persons connected with the revolutionary movements in Ireland. The governmental account of secret service money, under date of 20 June 1798, contains an entry of a payment of 1,000l. to \u2018F. H.\u2019 for the discovery of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. The initials are those of Higgins. Cooke recommended Lord Castlereagh to appropriate a pension of 300l. per annum to Higgins, on the ground that he had given him much information and all the intelligence which had enabled him to effect the arrest of Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Higgins died in affluence at Dublin on 19 January 1802, and was buried in the cemetery of Kilbarrack.\n",
    "Chilean Thoroughbred racehorse\nFor other uses, see Wolf (disambiguation).\nWolf (19 August 1987\u20132002) was a champion Chilean Thoroughbred racehorse who won the Chilean Triple Crown while undefeated, compiling a win streak of ten races, including six consecutive Group 1 wins, and was named the Chilean Horse of the Year in 1990 and 1991. According to articles by El Turf and Textual, Wolf is considered to be one of the best Chilean racehorses ever. Along with Gran Ducato, he was voted the Chilean Horse of the Decade of 1990. Wolf became known as the 'turf champion' of his home track, Club H\u00edpico de Santiago.\nBackground\nWolf was a dark bay or brown horse with no markings and was bred by Haras Santa Amelia.\nWolf's sire Domineau was bred in the United States, where he spent his racing career, winning only 3 of 51 starts and $97,615, never advancing beyond the allowance level. Exported to Chile, Domineau found more success as a sire, becoming the leading sire in Chile in 1988 and 1990.\nWolf was sold at auction and purchased by trainer Hern\u00e1n Miranda for the \"Stud Panam\u00e1\", who found some physical issues with Wolf's feet and returned him to his breeder. Haras Santa Amelia campaigned Wolf, with Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Allende Fern\u00e1ndez as his trainer.\nRacing career\nIn Chile (1990-1991)\nWolf debuted as a two-year-old on April 29, 1990, in a 1300-meter maiden race at Club H\u00edpico de Santiago, which he won by five and a half lengths. A month later, he easily won the Group 3 Cl\u00e1sico Raimundo Vald\u00e9s C. over 1600 meters, with a winning margin of nine lengths.\nWolf's third race was the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico Alberto Vial Infante, also 1600 meters long. Along with being his first start at the highest level of racing, it was his first start on a yielding track, since all of this other starts were run under firm conditions. He didn't handle the yielding track well, with his trainer Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Allende Fern\u00e1ndez saying that he dropped in level on the surface. Wolf struggled in the race, but managed to defeat Mayfair by one and a quarter lengths.\nWolf returned to the races as a three-year-old in the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico Nacional Ricardo Lyon, run over 2000 meters. He ran in fifth place in the early parts of the race before moving to the lead 400 meters from the finish, pulling away to win by an authoritative eight and a quarter lengths.\nA month later, Wolf ran in the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico El Ensayo, one of the most important races on the Chilean calendar and first leg of the Chilean Triple Crown. Ten rivals faced Wolf, including Mayfair, who took the early lead in the 2400 meter race. Wolf ran the same way he did in the Cl\u00e1sico Nacional Ricardo Lyon, waiting in fifth place before making his move around the final turn. Once again, Wolf pulled away easily, winning by seven and a quarter lengths and setting a new track record of 2:23.1.\nThe Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico St. Leger, second leg of the Triple Crown, was Wolf's next race, run on December 1, 1990. It was his first race at a different track, Hip\u00f3dromo Chile, and his first race on the dirt. The favorite for the race was Memo, then considered the best horse in training at Hip\u00f3dromo Chile. The confrontation between the two colts was built up as the 'race of the century', with nearly one hundred thousand people attending the race.\nAs per his usual, Memo took the lead right out of the gates, but Wolf's jockey Luis Mu\u00f1oz Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez rode him much closer to the pace than usual, in third place, to avoid giving Memo too much of an advantage early on. Wolf moved into second place a little over 900 meters from the finish, and Luis Mu\u00f1oz Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez pushed him to stay on Memo's heels, despite so much of the 2200 meter race still being left to run. Coming into the homestretch, Wolf drew up next to Memo, and the two dug in for the final 400 meters. The two drew away from the rest of the field, by over twenty lengths. The two remained neck-and-neck until the final 150 meters, when Wolf began to open up on Memo, eventually winning by a length and a three-quarters. Afterwards, Wolf's trainer Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Allende Fern\u00e1ndez said \"This is the loveliest race I have ever seen in my life.\"\nWolf returned to Club H\u00edpico de Santiago later that month to run in the Group 1 Gran Cl\u00e1sico Coronaci\u00f3n, run over a distance of 2000 meters. He won the race by nine lengths in a \"walk\".\nThe third and final leg of the Chilean Triple Crown, the Group 1 Cl\u00e1sico El Derby, a 2400-meter long race at Valparaiso Sporting Club, was run February 3, 1991. Wolf was a strong favorite become the first horse since Pr\u00f3logo in 1966 to win the Triple Crown, despite the return presence of Memo. Wolf performed as expected, and the race unfolded much like the St. Leger, although this time Wolf crossed the finish line five lengths ahead of Memo.\nFor his campaign in 1990 and 1991, Wolf was named the Chilean Champion Turf Two-Year-Old, Champion Turf Three-Year-Old, Champion Dirt Three-Year-Old, and Horse of the Year.\nIn the United States (1991-1992)\nWolf's American campaign began July 29, 19",

    "Municipal building in Epping, Essex, England\nEpping Civic Offices is a municipal building in Epping, Essex, a town in England. The building, which accommodates the headquarters of Epping Forest District Council, is a grade II listed building.\nHistory\nAfter the Epping Union and Rural Sanitary Authority was succeeded by Epping Urban District Council in 1896, the council decided to use Epping Town Hall as its offices and meeting place. However, the company that had developed the town hall got into financial difficulties and the council had to use temporary facilities for its meetings, before relocating to Hawthorn Lodge on the opposite side of the High Street. Hawthorn Lodge continued to serve as the headquarters of the council for much of the 20th century, but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Epping Forest District Council was formed at No. 323 High Street in Epping in 1974.\nBy the late 1980s, the council needed more substantial offices. The council held a two-stage competition, judged by Piers Gough.  It received 51 entries, and the winner was Richard Reid and Associates, with a postmodern design. This incorporated the existing mid-19th century house, No. 323 High Street, which the council occupied, and an office block, built in the 1970s, which the council also occupied. Work on the new building started in 1987. Ove Arup and Partners acted as the structural engineers, and the building was completed in 1992.\nIn 2021, the council refurbished the building, removing some corridors to create open-plan offices, and creating a community hub and new meeting and conference spaces.  Following the refurbishment, the council sought to let the top floor to private companies.\nArchitecture\nThe central part of the building is a three-storey office block, with a concrete frame, and brick and stone cladding.  To its south-west is a two-storey, three-bay former house, No. 323 High Street, converted into offices, and to its rear is a 1970s three-storey, rectangular office block.  The three are connected by first- and second-floor corridors, while at ground floor level there is vehicular access to the rear car park.  Attached to the front of the building is a tall red-brick tower, rectangular at ground level, but octagonal in top two stages.  The tower has a stone cornice, and minimalist clocks on four sides.  North-east of the tower is a brick arch, providing access to the reception area, with a balcony above, and stone steps providing direct access to the council chamber and its gallery.  These are in a bow-fronted section, clad in reconstituted stone, with ground floor pilasters.  Further to the north-east is a seven-bay section with two oriel windows, and then a four-bay section placed further forward, again clad in stone, containing the staff canteen and council members' room.\nAfter the building was completed a series of letters criticising the design appeared in local newspapers. However, the project won a Regional Award (East Anglia) from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1993, and the architectural historian, Charles Jencks, described the design as a \"superb example\u2026of contextualism\". The building was grade II listed in 2017.\n",

Its primary export was computer hardware\u2014chiefly computer monitors\u2014through its American subsidiary ADI Systems. For a time, it was the fifth largest monitor manufacturer in the world, with major customers including Apple, Compaq, and Optiquest.\nHistory\nADI Corporation (an initialism for Advanced Data International) was founded in Taiwan in March 1979 by Liao Jian-cheng. The company was originally a diversified concern, manufacturing a number of disparate products, including footwear for Nike, Inc. By the time the company entered the market for computer hardware in the 1980s, ADI still had a contract with Nike to produce shoes. Its first computer-related exports were data terminals and computer monitors.\nIn 1986, Liao Jian-cheng merged ADI with his other corporation Cheng Chang Enterprises Co., Ltd. In 1987, the company went public on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Around the same time, the company established Quimax Systems, an American subsidiary dedicated to importing the company's monitors and terminals manufactured in Taiwan. A major customer of Quimax in the 1980s was Esprit Systems, a seller of terminals that was spun off from Hazeltine Corporation within the decade. In 1989, ADI became a major shareholder in Espirit, and in 1990 the year they led a group of other Taiwanese companies in a takeover of Espirit that transformed the public American company into a privately owned venture.\nBy the turn of the 1990s, ADI was a leading manufacturer of terminals and displays in Taiwan. ADI began offering monitors under their own name starting in 1993, under the subbrand MicroScan. Major customers of ADI soon included Apple Computer, Compaq, and Optiquest.:\u200a72\u200a:\u200a118\u200a Of these customers, Compaq was by far the largest, ADI producing nearly all of their monitors in the 1990s. In November 1994, Compaq formed a joint venture with ADI to raise factories in Mexico, Brazil, and Europe to assemble and store ADI's monitors, helping reduce the travel time from Taiwan to ADI's major exports. Unit shipments increased from 1.1\u00a0million in 1993 to 1.6\u00a0million in 1994. Also in 1994, ADI piloted the production of an i486SX subnotebook, although it never came to fruition.\nIn 1998, ADI obtained the rights from Sony to sell monitors with Trinitron picture tubes, starting with the MicroScan 5GT. Around the turn of the millennium, the company began selling flat-panel monitors, chiefly LCDs.\nADI went defunct around the same time they let their American website domain name expire in December 2006.\n",

From 1958 to 1966, a building at the park hosted the district's municipal library until it moved to its current premises in the district's main square.\nZoo\nThe park's lake was located adjacent to Barranco Zoo (Spanish: Zool\u00f3gico de Barranco), created in 1947 with the arrival of the animals previously part of the zoo located at the Parque de la Exposici\u00f3n, eventually developing into a full-fledged zoo with over 600 specimens in 1956.\nAt least two elephants were purchased from a circus by the district's municipality to form part of the zoo's collection: in 1959, it acquired six-year-old Mary Jumbo from the \"Tropicana\" circus at the Plaza Dos de Mayo\u2014who refused to board a truck and walked from the historic centre of Lima towards the zoo\u2014and in 1962 another elephant walked the same path, alongside a camel, and two lions, a puma and a siberian bear known as \"Chaplin\" who rode a bicycle as part of its performances. Additionally, a lioness known as \"La Reina\" arrived from Costa Rica in 1959, and two polar bears known as Karl and Hilda arrived from California on April 27, 1964.\nOther animals featured at the park included condors, hippos and sea lions in the lake, as well as jaguars and pumas. The aforementioned six-ton Mary Jumbo became well known for her calmness when being photographed alongside young visitors, as did a giant turtle originally from the exhibit at the Parque Neptuno. The zoo's collection often received donations from a number of different countries as a symbol of their friendship with Peru.\nBy the time it closed on May 15, 1970, its number of unique specimens had been reduced to around 250, with all of them moving to the Parque de las Leyendas, inaugurated in 1964.\nStadium\nLuis G\u00e1lvez Chipoco (1877\u20131960)\nBoth the park and the zoo were replaced by a neoclassical stadium named after athlete and former CONSUDATLE President Dr. Luis G\u00e1lvez Chipoco (Arica; September 6, 1877 \u2014 Barranco; March 27, 1960), which was inaugurated on October 12, 1986, by then mayor Jorge del Castillo. It features a full-sized soccer field, an athletic track and a swimming pool. The park's remaining area has since become the Family Park (Spanish: Parque de la Familia), and it features an artificial lake populated by geese whose conditions have been criticised on numerous occasions.\nIn 2009, a modernised athletic track was inaugurated as part of Peru's bid to host the 2015 Pan American Games due to a design error at the renovated National Stadium.\nSee also\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Lima\n",
    "Galaxy pair in the constellation Draco\nNGC 6365 is a pair of spiral galaxies in the constellation Draco. It consists of two galaxies, PGC 60174 to the south, and PGC 60171 to the north. These two galaxies are also designated respectively by the NASA/IPAC database as NGC 6365A and NGC 6365B. This pair of galaxies was discovered by German astronomer Lewis Swift in 1884.\nNGC 6563A\nNGC 6563A is the northern counterpart of NGC 6563, and is a barred spiral galaxy. Its coordinates are 17h 22m 43.8s and 62\u00b0 09\u2032 57.9\u2033. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 8,413 \u00b1 4\u00a0km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 124.1 \u00b1 8.7 Mpc (\u223c405\u00a0million ly).\nThe luminosity class of NGC 6365A is III-IV and it has a broad HI line. It is an active galaxy (AGN) of type Seyfert 2.\nWith a surface brightness equal to 14.00 mag/am^2, we can qualify NGC 6365A as a low surface brightness galaxy (LSB). LSB galaxies are diffuse (D) galaxies with a surface brightness less than one magnitude lower than that of the ambient night sky.\nTo date, nearly fifteen measurements not based on redshift give a distance of 111.469 \u00b1 31.088 Mpc (\u223c364\u00a0million ly), which is within the values of the Hubble distance.\nSupernova\nThe supernova SN 2003U was discovered in NGC 6365A on January 27, 2003, by Scottish astronomer Tom Boles. This supernova was of type Ia.\nNGC 6563B\nNGC is the southern counterpart of NGC 6563, and is a spiral galaxy. However, the NASA/IPAC database and Professor Seligman indicate that it is Magellanic in type. Its coordinates are 17h 22m 43.5s and 62\u00b0 10\u2032 25.4\u2033. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 7,975 \u00b1 4\u00a0km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 117.6 \u00b1 8.2 Mpc (\u223c384\u00a0million ly). The luminosity class of NGC 6365B is IV-V and it has a broad HI line. It also contains regions of ionized hydrogen.\nGalaxy interaction\nThe pair of galaxies that make up NGC 6563 appear in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies under the designation Arp 30. Arp describes NGC 6365 as a spiral galaxy with an overdeveloped arm, but this has been recently confirmed by astronomers to be false. In the image used by Arp, PGC 60171 (NGC 6365B) appears to be part of PGC 60174 and to be one galaxy. But, they are actually two separate galaxies. According to redshift-based measurements, NGC 6365A is the most distant galaxy. However, given the uncertainties in the measurements, NGC 6365B could be the most distant galaxy. The image taken by the telescope at the Mount Lemmon observatory does not allow us to decide. There is no publication that is only speculative about their position and also about their interaction.\nSee also\nList of NGC objects (6001\u20137000)\nAtlas of Peculiar Galaxies\nLists of galaxies\nList of supernovae\nExternal links\nNGC 6563 at SIMBAD\n",
    "Shanghai-based fashion labelShushu/Tong, also stylized as SHUSHU/TONG, is a Shanghai-based fashion label founded in 2015 by designers Liushu Lei and Yutong Jiang. Its design sensibility is inspired by girlhood, nostalgia, and retro anime and films.\nShushu/Tong was noted as one of a number of rising Chinese fashion brands associated with guochao (Chinese: \u56fd\u6f6e; pinyin: Gu\u00f3 ch\u00e1o), a fashion trend among younger Chinese shoppers to prefer homegrown designers which incorporate aspects of Chinese history and culture. The brand has collaborated with Asics and Charles & Keith, for footwear, local brand Yvmin for a line of jewelry, and Est\u00e9e Lauder for holiday cosmetic gift sets. The brand's collaboration with Est\u00e9e Lauder was noted as the first time a global brand had collaborated with a Chinese fashion brand.\nThe first physical Shushu/Tong store opened in July 2022 in Shanghai JC Plaza.\nFounders\nFounders Liushu Lei and Yutong Jiang were both born in Chengdu and attended the same high school. Both Lei and Tong were inspired by the anime Nana to become designers, although Jiang was briefly interested in becoming a cartoonist before realizing she preferred fashion. The two met at Shanghai's Donghua University when studying fashion in 2014. The two went on to acquire MA degrees at London College of Fashion, where the two were flatmates and first conceived of the brand. Lei spent time interning with Simone Rocha, and Jiang with Gareth Pugh. After a failing to acquire a visa to stay in London, Shushu/Tong was officially founded in 2015 in Shanghai. The label's name is a combination of Lei's nickname, Shushu, and Jiang's given name, Yutong.\nLei is the creative director of the brand, while Jiang is more involved on the marketing and client side, although she also has input on the design process. Their first sales were made on Chinese social media platform WeChat, before the brand was picked up by other stockists; social media has been an avenue which allowed their brand to grow despite not being located in a traditional fashion capital like Paris.\nDesign and influences\nShushu/Tong is noted for its hyper-feminine style, having been compared to the coquette Internet aesthetic and Lolita fashion. The brand was noted for predating the trend of hyper-girly clothing after 2020. Their designs often incorporate girly elements like frills, bows, ribbons, and pearls, as well as gingham and pastel fabric. Works that have inspired collections include the Aim for the Ace!, The Virgin Suicides, Gigi, and the protagonists of magical girl anime such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Cardcaptor Sakura. The founders named Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Tina Chow as muses, and Faye Wong as a perennial inspiration as well as celebrity they would like to dress someday.\nJiang also serves as a muse for Lei, as she models items and provides early feedback, giving a woman's perspective to Lei's designs. This may have contributed to criticism against the brand for their limited range of body shapes.\n",

President William McKinley appointed her commissioner to the Paris Exposition, 1900, as well as to represent the U.S. and the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) at the unveiling of the statue of General Lafayette in Paris, July 4, 1900. On July 3, 1900, she assisted in unveiling the statue of George Washington, a gift of the women of the U.S. to France. Among her many roles, Manning served as President-General of the DAR for two terms. During the years that her husband, Daniel Manning held the portfolio of the United States Secretary of the Treasury their home in Washington, D.C. became a center of social and political affairs in Washington. After widowhood in 1887, she continued to spend part of each year in Washington. Her patriotism was shown in her work for the DAR Mohawk Chapter of Albany, New York, of which she was regent.\nEarly life and education\nMary Margaretta Fryer was born at Albany, New York. Her parents were William John Fryer, one of the early merchant princes of Albany, and Margaret Livingston (Crofts) Fryer. Mary Margaretta could trace her Dutch ancestry back many generations in Holland on her father's side. On her mother's side, she traced her ancestry from Robert Livingston, the first lord of Livingston Manor.\nShe was educated at the Albany Academy for Girls and private schools.\nCareer\nOn November 19, 1884, in Albany, she married Daniel Manning, who, in the following March, was appointed U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Grover Cleveland.\nAt Washington, D.C., Mrs. Manning held a powerful position in social affairs, and though she returned to Albany after her husband's death in December 1887, kept up her Washington connections. She organized a hospital corps of a thousand women for service during the Spanish\u2013American War (1898).\nBesides serving as President-General of the DAR for two successive terms, she was regent of the Mohawk Chapter of the DAR, and in February 1900, was a member of its Memorial Continental Hall committee.

    "2024 killing of a United States Air Force serviceman\nOn May 3, 2024, United States Air Force serviceman Roger Fortson was fatally shot in his home by a Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.\nShooting\nPolice radio audio showed a disturbance report made on May 3, 2024, around 4.30 p.m., for a residential complex, where a deputy said: \"Don't have anything further than a male and female; it's all fourth-party information from the front desk at the leasing office\".\nBody camera footage shows an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy being told by a woman in a residential complex to go to Apartment 1401. The woman tells the deputy that \"two weeks ago\" when walking beside that apartment, she heard some \"yelling\" and profanities, as well as the sound of a slap, but she was not sure where that sound came from.\nAccording to body camera footage, the sheriff's deputy arrived at Apartment 1401, and initially knocked without announcing who he is. The deputy then moves off to the side of the door, where it seems he cannot be seen from the apartment's peephole. About 30 seconds later, the deputy knocks on the door again, this time announcing: \"Sheriff\u2019s office, open the door.\" Around 10 seconds later, the deputy knocks on the door another time, and again announces: \"Sheriff's office, open the door.\" According to Fortson's mother and girlfriend, who had been on FaceTime with him, Fortson heard a knock on his door and received no response when he asked who was at the door. His girlfriend also indicated that Fortson attempted to look through his peephole but was unable to see anyone, and had armed himself believing that someone was breaking in.\nAccording to body camera footage, Fortson opens the door holding a gun in his right hand, with the gun held by his side and pointed downwards. As the door opens, the deputy tells Fortson to \"step back\" and immediately shoots Fortson. Five or six gunshots are fired. Around the time Fortson is shot, he lifts his left hand in front of his chest. Fortson falls to the floor, and it is only then that the deputy tells Fortson: \"Drop the gun!\"\nAfter the shooting, Fortson was brought to a hospital, where he died.\nResponse\nOn May 4, 2024, the Okaloosa County's Sheriff's Office said that the shooting occurred at an apartment after a sheriff's deputy responded to a call of a \"disturbance in progress\": \"Hearing sounds of a disturbance,  reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun and after the deputy had identified himself as law enforcement.\" The Sheriff's Office further said that the unnamed deputy had been put on \"paid administrative leave\". Body camera footage of the shooting was later released by the Sheriff's Office on May 9, 2024.\nOne of the family's attorney's stated that Fortson died due to officers knocking on the wrong door, and that while mistakes happen, good people own their mistakes. Benjamin Crump, who is also representing the family criticized the sheriff's account that was released prior to the video being released.\n",
    "Bilateral relationsSomalia\u2013Syria relations refer to foreign relations between Somalia and Syria. Diplomatic relations were established when Syria opened its embassy in Mogadishu on 13 December 1964. Both nations are Arab League & Organisation of Islamic Cooperation members and maintain relations.\nHistory\nDiplomatic relations between Syria and Somalia were established on 13 December 1964. Historically and presently, the relationship between the two countries is characterized by mutual amicability.\nSomalia strongly opposed Israel's attack on Egypt & Syria in the Six-Day War in 1967 and their occupation of the Golan and is of the opinion that the Golan is sovereign Syrian territory. Conversely, Syria strongly supports the territorial integrity of Somalia and rejects the legitimacy of Somaliland, considering it to be Somali territory.\nSomalia also supported the Arab coalition in the Yom Kippur War in which Syria was the main belligerent on the Golan front.\nIn turn, Syria supported Somalia in the Ogaden War, sending a small expeditionary infantry force to assist Somalia's war effort even receiving President Siad Barre on a state visit to Damascus in 1977, despite Syria's exceptionally close relationship with the Soviet Union. During the latter half of the Cold War, President Hafez al-Assad viewed Somalia with some caution as Somalia had a very close relationship with Iraq, as Hafez and Iraq's President Saddam Hussein were vying for influence regionally and within the Ba'ath Party and both leaders despised each other.\nWhen the Somali government collapsed in 1991, Syria received many Somali refugees and extended privileges such as state-subsided healthcare to the refugees.\nNotably, Somalia did not fully cut relations with Syria as a result of the civil war in Syria unlike many other Arab or Muslim countries, merely temporarily vacating their embassy. In fact, relations are still warm between Somalia and Syria on account of Syria's past stances of Somalia, particularly Syria's support of Somalia in the Ogaden War and the government's positive reception of Somali refugees. Somalia's embassy on occasion sends diplomatic dispatches to affirm Somalia's support for Syria.\nThere are a significant amount of Syrian refugees in Somalia who are well received as they are perceived to be high skilled labourers and Somalia benefits from the additional labour force.\nDiplomatic missions\nSomalia has an embassy in Damascus, and Syria maintains a non-resident embassy in Sanaa.\nSee also\nForeign relations of Somalia\nForeign relations of Syria\n",

    "Spanish footballer\nEnrique Molina Soler (4 May 1904 \u2013 15 July 1943) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Valencia CF. Apart from football, he also played Basque pelota in Valencia, and was one of the organizers of the Volta a Peu del Mercantil Valenciano.\nEarly life\nEnrique Molina was born on 4 May 1904 in the Russafa neighborhood, which at that time had just been annexed to the city of Valencia, into a conservative and deeply Catholic family. It was a small district surrounded by orchards, in which his family worked and in which he began to play football, a sport that was beginning to enjoy some success in the city of Valencia.\nPlaying career\nFrom a very young age he stood out as an athlete and for his physical form, so at the age of 16, he joined the ranks of the now-extinct Uni\u00f3n Levantina. He remained there for two seasons, until 1922, when he joined Gimn\u00e1stico FC, where he played alongside the likes of Silvino and Alfredo Arr\u00f3niz. While there, he became the most notable midfielder in the city, standing out for his bravery on the field of play and his extraordinary ability to recover balls in the center of the field, pushing the team towards the attack with an energy never seen in those times.\nIn the summer of 1924, Molina was signed by Valencia CF, which meant greatly weakening its eternal rival, and in fact, they won the following three Regional Championships\u00a0, with Molina playing a crucial role in those titles. In his first year, however, his performances were heavily affected by an illness, but he was at his best in the next nine, displaying great pride and consistency that was only interrupted in 1931 due to a knee injury and the enormous impact caused by the death of his wife, whom he had married only a year before. Molina became one of the first great players in the club's history, as he remained in the team for ten seasons, experiencing the first years of the club's professionalization in 1926, the debut in both the Copa del Rey and La Liga in its inaugural season in 1929, and the first promotion to the First Division in 1931, retiring in 1934, shortly before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Together with Cirilo Amor\u00f3s and Enrique Salvador, Molina formed what was known as the \"glorious media\", which achieved the first feats in national football. In 1929, with an economic crisis at the club, he agreed to reduce the fee and calmed down an attempted rebellion by the footballers against the coach.\nMolina was a very temperamental man; for instance, during his time as a referee, he assaulted a Correspondencia journalist\u00a0. On another occasion, during a match in Torrero against Iberia, he was attacked with an umbrella by a spectator, and Molina, without flinching, snatched the weapon from him and ended up throwing the fan out of the stadium. He once even drove his car into the Mestalla Stadium to remove a referee who was threatened by the stands.\nAdmired by critics and caricaturists, Molina received thunderous ovations not only at Mestalla, but also in rival stadiums, notably in his farewell match in a League fixture in Vitoria-Gasteiz, when the entire audience at the Mendizorrotza stood up and paid a resounding tribute to him. In 1933, he was the subject of a tribute match, a friendly match against the Spanish national team in the Mestalla Stadium on 30 April 1933, a team for which he was permanently called up, but with which he unfairly never made his debut. In total, he played 323 games with the Valencia club.\nLater life and death\nOnce he retired, Molina was able to start a small business with the little savings generated by his activity as a player.\nA Falangist since before the outbreak of the Civil War, Molina enrolled in the Blue Division as a volunteer, a militia that moved from Spain to provide support to the Army of Nazi Germany in the fight against the Soviet Union during the Second World War. He died after being attacked by cannon fire while transporting two Nazi Germany drivers on a motorcycle with a sidecar during the Siege of Leningrad on 15 July 1943. The chronicles of the time relate that he was hit by a shell and the shrapnel shattered his skull. He was buried in the Mestelevo cemetery.\nMolina's case was not the only one of a professional Spanish football player who joined the Blue Division, with Ram\u00f3n Herrera, a player for Sporting de Gij\u00f3n and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, also going to fight in Soviet lands alongside Nazi Germany, but unlike Molina, Herrera had better luck and returned to Spain. \nHonours\nValencia CF\nValencia Championship:\nWinners (7) 1925, 1926, 1927, 1931, 1932, 1933, and 1924\n",
    "Spanish sailor, entrepreneur, and sports leader\nEnrique Pardi\u00f1as y Barreiros was a Spanish sailor and sports leader who served as the second president of Real Sociedad between 1912 and 1915, and as the first president Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Clubes de F\u00fatbol (UECF), the forerunner federation of the current Royal Spanish Football Federation between 1912 and 1914.\nSporting career\nAthlete\nAt the end of the 19th century, Pardi\u00f1as was a member of the Spanish colonial administration of Cuba (acting secretary), and at the beginning of the 20th century, he was a member of San Sebasti\u00e1n's high society. He stood out in the sport of sailing, both as a sailor, winning the first edition of the Argentine Yacht Club Cup in 1908, but also as a skipper, federator, and mainly as commodore of the Real Club N\u00e1utico de San Sebasti\u00e1n\u00a0, a position he still held when he died in 1920.\nPresidencial mandates\nIn 1912, Pardi\u00f1as was appointed as the second president of Real Sociedad, replacing Adolfo S\u00e1enz. As president of this club, he was one of the promoters and founders of the Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Clubes de F\u00fatbol (UECF), a federation founded by the dissidents of the FECF, the current Royal Spanish Football Federation, following a disagreement about the venue of the 1913 Copa del Rey. He was elected president of this entity at the constitution assembly of this federation, held in San Sebasti\u00e1n at the end of December 1912. The Gipuzkoan teams joined it, with the notable exception of Racing de Ir\u00fan, a part of the Catalans with FC Barcelona at the helm, and some clubs from other regions.\nDuring 1913, a great rivalry arose between both federations, and two parallel Copa del Rey tournaments were held in March 1913, an \"official\", organized by FECF in Madrid, and an \"unofficial\", organized by the UECF in Barcelona. Pardi\u00f1as' personal friendship with Queen Victoria Eugenia made it possible for the queen to \"donate\" a Cup for the Copa del Rey sponsored by this federation, and likewise, Pardi\u00f1as managed to get King Alfonso XIII to grant the title of \"Royal\" to the UECF, before he did the same as compensation to the FECF. This royal recognition gave the UECF a certain prestige and made it a serious rival to the FECF, although the number of clubs affiliated with it was considerably smaller. In the Copa del Rey sponsored by the UECF, Real Sociedad, chaired by Pardi\u00f1as himself, faced FC Barcelona in a double match for the title, and after drawing in both games, FC Barcelona won in the final third tiebreaker match.\nThe UECF tried to gain recognition from FIFA by holding an international match against a French XI, held on 25 May 1913 at the Amute in Hondarribia, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw and which is now considered to have been the first-ever (unofficial) match of a Spanish national team. The UECF's attempt to affiliate with FIFA caused the international federation to issue an ultimatum to the two Spanish federations forcing them to merge if they wanted to be recognized by FIFA. During the summer of 1913, arduous negotiations were carried out between the two federations that finally led to the creation of several regional federations and the new Royal Spanish Football Federation in September 1913. The Royal Spanish Union of Clubs, although without activity since September, it was not officially dissolved until 5 February 1914. The RFEF recognized the title obtained by Barcelona in the UECF tournament as part of the Cup's record, as the 1913 UECF Copa del Rey.\n",
    "\nThe Russian submarine Narval (Russian: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043b, lit.\u2009'narwhal') was the lead ship of the Narval class of submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy. The boat was laid down in December 1911 and launched in April 1915, before undergoing sea trials and entering service in September  1915. Just after being launched, Narval was inspected by Emperor Nicholas II. The submarine was built for the Black Sea Fleet, and its construction was accelerated after the outbreak of World War I. Narval took part in raiding Ottoman coal shipping along the Anatolian coast during the war, and was credited with destroying 31 ships for a total of 5,717\u00a0gross register tons\u00a0(GRT), making it the second highest achieving Russian submarine in the Black Sea.\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the submarine remained in Sevastopol, where it was first captured by the Germans and then by the British and the White Army in the Russian Civil War. The British scuttled Narval and several other submarines near Sevastopol in April 1919 to prevent the Bolsheviks from taking them.\nDesign and construction\nNarval being launched.Emperor Nicholas II leaving Narval after his inspection.\nAfter being defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Empire began rebuilding its Navy. Initially the main focus of the naval arms programs was on the Baltic and Pacific fleets, but as tensions increased with Austria-Hungary due to the Bosnian crisis in 1908 and with Ottoman Turkey after the expansion of its navy, the Black Sea Fleet was given more attention. The 1911 naval program approved by the State Duma included the order of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet, which ended up being three Narval-class boats and three Morzh class. The Nevsky Factory\u00a0 in Saint Petersburg developed the Narval class on the basis of a foreign design, the popular Holland type made by the American Holland Torpedo Boat Company. But there was a dispute in the Imperial Russian Navy before 1911 on which submarine type to purchase, the Narval class or the Morzh class that was designed by Ivan Bubnov, the chief submarine engineer of the Baltic Yard. Bubnov was supported by the Naval General Staff, while the foreign type was favored by members of the Naval Technological Committee, who argued that they needed to study foreign technological advancements. In the end, a conference led by Navy Minister Stepan Voevodskiy settled the matter by ordering three submarines of each class.\nThe Narval-class submarines were the most advanced Russian submarines at the time because unlike the rest they had crash-diving tanks for faster diving, internal bulkheads that provided more protection for the crew, and used natural flow to fill the main ballast tanks instead of pumps. A problem that arose during their construction was that the twin 1,140 horsepower (850\u00a0kW) diesel engines to power each boat had been ordered from Germany and were not delivered by the time World War I broke out, so they had to be replaced by four American-built engines that each provided 210 horsepower (160\u00a0kW). This meant that the designed 16-knot (30\u00a0km/h; 18\u00a0mph) surface speed could not be attained, and neither could the 12-knot (22\u00a0km/h; 14\u00a0mph) underwater speed. Narval had slightly different weaponry from the other boats in its class, being equipped with two Japanese 75\u00a0mm (3\u00a0in) deck guns and two 7.62\u00a0mm machine guns (the latter were installed in 1917). It also had four 450\u00a0mm (18\u00a0in) torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars (reduced to four in 1917). It was heavier than the other two boats, having a displacement of 673 long tons (684\u00a0t) on the surface and 1,045 long tons (1,062\u00a0t) while underwater.\nConstruction of all three Narval-class submarines began in Saint Petersburg, where they were laid down in December 1911, before being transferred to the shipyards in Nikolayev for the final assembly. The engines were not delivered from the United States until January 1915. Narval was launched on 24 April  1915 and was inspected by Emperor Nicholas II several days later on 28 April. The submarine then carried out sea trials until August, which were accelerated to meet the demands of the war, and it was completed on 5 September  1915.\nService history\nWorld War I\nAt the time when Narval entered service with the Russian Black Sea Fleet, it was focused on disrupting the Ottoman merchant convoys transporting coal from the area of Zonguldak to Constantinople, which was the main source of fuel for the Ottoman Navy. The new Russian submarines that joined the fleet were tasked with patrolling the Anatolian coast and the entrance to the Bosporus. In December 1915 Narval experienced engine problems while on patrol near the Bosporus, and underwent repairs from January to April 1916 in Sevastopol. Its engines were modified with parts from those of unfinished AG-class submarines. Despite the engine issues, Narval and the other boats of its class became popular with Russian submarine crews. These three boats formed the 2nd Squadron of the",

    "1999 crime novel by Australian author Barry Maitland\nThe Chalon Heads is a 1999 crime novel by the Australian author Barry Maitland.\nIt was the fourth novel in the author's Brock and Kola series of novels.\nSynopsis\nThe young wife of ex-criminal Sammy Startling has been kidnapped and the ransom note was decorated with Chalon Head stamps of the young Queen Victoria. These stamps are both rare and valuable and detectives Kathy Killa and David Brock go to Cabot's philately store to meet Startling and investigate the crime.\nPublishing history\nAfter its initial publication in Australia by Allen and Unwin in 1999, it was reprinted as follows:\n1999, UK, Orion\n2000, Australia, Allen and Unwin\n2000, UK, Orion\n2001, USA, Arcade\n2002, USA, Penguin\n2007, Australia, Allen and Unwin\n2010, USA, Felony & Mayhem Press\nThe novel was also translated into Russian in 2008.\nEpigraph\nEpigraph: \"Philately: The term was coined in 1864 by a Frenchman, Georges Herpin, who invented it from the Greek philos, 'love', and ateleia, 'that which is tax-free'. Britannica Online, 1997.\"\nCritical reception\nA reviewer in The Canberra Tmes noted: \"This is a very carefully crafted crime novel that is rich in detail and interesting minor characters. The plotting is suitably serpentine and Maitland keeps us on our toes with some very unexpected turns. The plot unfolds at a good pace, helped along by a couple of well-staged chase scenes and a particularly grisly discovery...Stamp collectors will also probably find the philatelic detail interesting and there is even an Australian angle in the form of the three Chalon Head stamps from Van Diemen's Land which are central to the plot...Overall The Chalon Heads is very good, although Brock lacks the distinctive edge to make him, and the series, stand out from the rest of the very good British police novels that are around.\"\nStuart Coupe in The Sydney Morning Herald was very enthusiastic about the novel: \"The Chalon heads is significantly better than almost all the police procedural novels I've read in recent years, with Maitland displaying an impressive and convincing grasp of the machinations and motivations of working police officers, their strengths, weaknesses and foibles. This novel is right up there with the best contemporary crime fiction and, with Allen & Unwin in Australia and Orion Books in Britain as Mailtand's new publishers, one can but hope the author gains the increased international recognition he so clearly deserves.\"\nAwards\n2000 Barry Award - Best British Crime Novel finalist\nSee also\n1999 in Australian literature\n",
    "\nThe 2012 Ivorian coup attempt was a failed coup d'\u00e9tat by exiled military officers loyal to former president Laurent Gbagbo to overthrow President Alassane Ouattara's administration in the Ivory Coast. State security seized documents that outlined plans for the eventual overthrow and replacement of the democratically elected leader with a transitional military council.\nIn a public interview to national television, Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko accused pro-Gbagbo officers and former members of his administration of complicity in the plot to install a transitional military council, disclosing \"We had very specific information that a group of officers in exile in Accra were preparing a military operation in Ivory Coast aimed at destabilizing the country.\" He then proceeded to play a recorded video where a group of uniformed men, led by a spokesman, proclaimed the dissolution of the Ivory Coast's institutions and the establishment of a council for national sovereignty. The spokesman, later identified as Colonel Kate Gnotua, announces in the video, \"All state institutions are hereby dissolved. All political activities are suspended. A curfew has been put in place until further notice.\" The recorded video was intended to be broadcast to national television after the takeover.\nAmong the alleged leaders of the foiled coup plot were Moise Lida Kouassi, former defense minister and key ally of Laurent Gbagbo, and Colonel Kate Gnotua, former senior officer in Gbagbo's presidential guard. Kouassi later had a falling out with Kate Gnotua.\nThe coup plot involved a combination of Liberian mercenaries and Ivorian militias, with ties to Gbagbo's loyalists. The coup attempt was linked to recent violence, including the killing of seven UN peacekeepers, and involved elements from Gbagbo's presidential guard.\nIn the end several of the coup plotters were arrested, including Kate Gnatoa and Kouassi, who acknowledged awareness to the plot, admitting \"The documents that were seized during my arrest at my house in Lome did concern a transition and a crisis communication in Ivory Coast.\" He expresses regret for not informing the authorities sooner and indicated willingness to seek forgiveness from the president for his inaction.\n",

The third single, \"Suffocate\" featuring Poppy, was released on April 23, 2024.\nComposition\nYou Won't Go Before You're Supposed To has been described as metalcore and hardcore punk.\nCritical reception\nYou Won't Go Before You're Supposed To received widespread acclaim upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 92 out of 100 based on 6 reviews. Ellis Heasley of Distorted Sound Magazine compared it to Slipknot's Iowa \"in its complete disregard for what a band with this much hype is supposed to do in this situation...and ultimately stands as further irrefutable proof of a truly generational talent.\" Manus Hopkins writing for Exclaim! stated that \"at only 10 songs, with the longest still falling short of five minutes, You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To doesn't wear out its welcome.\" But they felt that \"Slaughterhouse 2\", featuring Chris Motionless, was \"slightly underwhelming in the shadow of its predecessor\", from Motionless in White's album, Scoring the End of the World. Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian called it \"an indulgently rich record that keeps revealing more on double-digit listens.\" According to Luke Morton of Kerrang!, \"the heaviness throughout is unrelenting. No acoustic number, no ballad, no concession... this isn\u2019t just their best record yet, it\u2019s one of the best albums of the year.\" Stephen Hill of Metal Hammer of praised Drew Fulk's production stating,  production gives the record perfect definition while making it sound as loud as a jet plane taking off inside your cranium.\"\nAccording to Caitlin McMahon of Metal Injection, \"Knocked Loose has embraced a melodic direction with this record,\" and called the album \"eerie and unsettling.\" Mandy Scythe of MetalSucks wrote, \"From start to finish, this is a solid, heavy record full of memorable and catchy moments that you\u2019ll want to revisit time and time again.\" According, to Ian Cohen of Pitchfork, \" amplified and concentrated their sound into something so potent that it has its own gravitational pull.\" Dylan Tuck writing for The Skinny wrote, \"You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To takes their staunchly savage sound and dashes it with piercing playfulness and crushing confidence; conjuring a profoundly poisonous record containing some of their most deadly moments to date.\" Sputnikmusic wrote that \" album destroys as much as possible while it\u2019s on... it leaves a little to be desired once it\u2019s over.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nKnocked Loose\nBryan Garris \u2013 vocals, lyrics\nIsaac Hale \u2013 lead guitar, vocals\nNicko Calderon \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nKevin Otten \u2013 bass\nKevin \"Pacsun\" Kaine \u2013 drums\nAdditional personnel\nPoppy \u2013 vocals (3)\nChris Motionless \u2013 additional vocals (7)\nTechnical\nDrew Fulk \u2013 production, mixing\nCharts\n",
    "American oyster farm\n\"Saltaire Oyster\" can from Adams Oyster Company, c. 1940s\nAdams Oyster Company was an oyster farm and seafood cannery business headquartered in Suffolk, Virginia, and by the 1950s was one of the largest oyster farm businesses in Virginia. The company held over 300 acres of oyster farms in the Nansemond River, Battens Bay, Bleakhorn Creek, Chuckatuck Creek, Cooper Creek, and the James River.\nHistory\nBy 1870, oystermen had planted themselves and their families on the peninsula between Chuckatuck Creek and the Nansemond River and drew a livelihood from the water. Members of the Adams family were oysterman in the area by the late 1880s. The Nansemond River was one of the richest oyster grounds in the Chesapeake Bay, and seafood businesses in Suffolk were shipping approximately 75,000 bushels of oysters a year by 1900.\nIn the 1920s, Charles Gray Adams I established an oyster company and oyster shucking house on the Hobson side of Chuckatuck Creek. Adams operated a fleet of over 30 boats out of the creek. Adams died in 1938.\nThe Adams Oyster Company was formally established in the 1940s by Adams' son, Captain Charles Gray \"Charlie\" Adams II and later became a partnership with Carl Bagnell when they merged the holdings with the Nansemond Fish and Oyster Company. The Adams Oysters Company sold oysters at local markets in Norfolk and shipped them to locations throughout the U.S. East Coast. The company also canned and sold a packaged oyster product called \"Saltaire Oysters\" and operated a steamed crab business near the Chuckatuck Creek location.\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, the \"Saltaire Oysters\" brand could be found in Kroger supermarkets, Fass Brothers, or Ballards. The company also sold directly to Colonial Stores and Campbell Soup Company for their canned oyster stew product, and was a certified interstate shellfish dealer. Charles Adams III worked for the company during this period, before being deployed to serve a tour of duty in the Vietnam War. In March 1968, Charles Adams III and three other watermen drowned when the oyster boat Klondike capsized with all four men on board.\nThe business activity had slowed by the end of the 1970s due to the decline of the oyster population and the Army Corps of Engineers construction of a dam on Carter's Clove Creek, which closed Hobson's direct outlet to Chuckatuck Creek and the James River. From the 1980s to the 2010s, the business remained registered as an active oyster farm with the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.\n",

Written by Johnny Young and produced by Bob Foster for Festival. It reached number\u00a0one on the Go-Set National Top\u00a040. It was covered by British pop group, Herman's Hermits, as \"Here Comes the Star\", in November, which reached No.\u00a033 on the UK singles chart.\nBackground\n\"The Star\" was released by Ross D. Wyllie in September 1969. Wyllie was the presenter of pop music TV show, Uptight, since October 1967, which was broadcast on ATV-0, Melbourne. He had issued singles both as a solo artist and as front man for the Uptight Party Team. He had a No.\u00a017 hit on Go-Set's National Top\u00a040 in July 1969, with his cover of Ray Stevens' 1963 song, \"Funny Man\".

At the 1969 King of Pop Awards, which were presented during an Uptight episode in that month, Wyllie was a contender for King of Pop alongside Morris but both lost out to Johnny Farnham. Australian musician and music critic Robert Forster, praised three of the best late 1960s pop stars \"Pop singing is an art... it was cathedral-sized: listen to Normie Rowe sing 'It's Not Easy', or  'The Star', or Colleen Hewett 'Superstar'\".\nWyllie was presented with a gold record, in 2003, for shipment of 35000 units of \"(Here Comes) The Star\".

    "\nVictory Parade in Russia\nParticipants in the Russian invasion of Ukraine on parade.\nThe 2024 Moscow Victory Day Parade was a military parade held in Red Square, Moscow, Russia, on 9 May 2024, to commemorate the 79th anniversary of Victory Day which celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of the Eastern Front of World War II. \nBackground\nVictory Day is a significant secular holiday in Russia that commemorates Germany's surrender in World War II, which marked the end of one of the deadliest conflicts in human history. The holiday celebrates the military might and moral fortitude of the Red Army, which suffered enormous losses in the war, with at least 20 million Soviet citizens losing their lives. Victory Day has been observed annually on May 9 since 1945, and it is one of the most revered and widely celebrated public holidays in Russia, with parades, fireworks, and concerts held across the country.\nParade summary\nPutin's Young Army on the Red Square\nMilitary parade on the Red Square\nAs light flurries of snow fell on Red Square, over 9,000 different troops from 30 various ceremonial regiments marched past the parade stand, 1,000 of which were involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Just like the previous Victory Day parade, the mechanized column section only featured one tank, a T-34-85, but for the first time in three years, aerial units took part in the parade: The Russian Knights aerobatic team flew Su-30 and MiG-29 fighters, followed by six Su-25 jets that emitted smoke in the colors of the Russian flag. As in prior parades, missile launchers, artillery, and ICBMs were shown. During the parade, Russian soldiers were equipped with what appeared to be drone jammers given the fear that there would be Ukrainian attacks during the ceremonies. For the first time since the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade, a president from an African nation was invited to the parade, as Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 of Guinea-Bissau was in attendance. This was the last Victory Day parade for Sergei Shoigu performing the duties of Minister of Defence, as three days after the parade, he was not reappointed to the position.\nPutin's speech\nPutin speaks from the podium\nTwo days after Putin's fifth inauguration as President of Russia, he criticized former Eastern Bloc Soviet satellite states, as well as several other countries formerly occupied by the Soviet Union for the removal of Soviet-era monuments and memorials dedicated to the Russian victory during World War II, saying that they are now dedicating monuments to \"traitors and Hitler's accomplices\", while erasing the history of noble world liberators. He also claimed that the west was trying to forget major battles during the War, and stated that Russia is trying its best to avoid a global conflict, but also will not let the nation be threatened.\nForeign dignitaries in attendance\nAmongst those in attendance were:\n President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko\n President of Cuba Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel\n President of Guinea-Bissau Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3\n President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev\n President of Kyrgyzstan Sadyr Japarov\n President of Laos Thongloun Sisoulith\n President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon\n President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedow\n President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev\nMusic\nMusic was performed by The massed bands of the Moscow Garrison.\nInspection of Troops\nSacred War (\u201c\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u201d)\nJubilee Slow March \"25 Years of the Red Army\" (\u042e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0448 \"25 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0420\u041a\u041a\u0410\")\nMarch of the Life-Guard Preobrazhensky Regiment  (\"\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448 \u041b\u0435\u0439\u0431-\u0433\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0430\")\nSlow March of Military Schools (\"\u0412\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0448 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\")\nSlow March for Carrying Out the Combat Banner (\"\u0412\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0417\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\")\nGuards Slow March of the Navy (\u0413\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448 \u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e-\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0424\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430\")\nSlow March (E.

    "Example of a form of transport on the Main\nChain boat navigation on the Main was a special type of ship transport on the Main from 1886 to 1936. Along a chain laid in the river, chain boats pulled themselves upstream with several barges attached. The technology of chain shipping replaced the previous practice of towed shipping, in which the ships were pulled by horses.\nModel of the Bavarian chain boat K.B.K.S. Nr. V\nAs the canalisation project progressed upstream, the barrages required for this made chain towage more challenging, particularly due to the extended waiting times at the locks. This led to the emergence of a new competitor in the form of the propeller, which was made possible by the greater depth of the navigation channel. The use of diesel engines made the propeller a profitable option. The use of steam engines for the labour-intensive chain navigation became unprofitable, and this method was completely discontinued in 1936.\nHistory\nMain article: Chain boat navigation\nBefore chain boat navigation\nThe Main River has a relatively gentle gradient. Until the mean water level correction in the middle of the 19th century, the river was a slow-flowing shallow watercourse with numerous loops, bends, islands and, on occasion, several shallow river arms in close proximity to one another. In contrast, the occurrence of strong floods, particularly during the autumn and spring months, resulted in the flooding of areas, the erosion of riverbanks and sedimentation. Conversely, during the summer months, the water level in the channels, which were typically only half a metre deep, decreased to a few centimetres, resulting in the formation of shallows and sandbanks.\nUpstream, the ship trains were towed by line riders. A typical train consisted of a chain of wooden vessels, each with a carrying capacity of 15 to 30 tonnes. They usually began with a Frankensau or a market boat and continued via Schelche, Schlumper and Nachen to the smallest vessel, the Ankernachen. The towpath often changed banks before the mouths of the tributaries or before steep slopes. At these points, horses and riders had to cross the navigation channel or be ferried across. Downstream, the ships drifted in the water current. Sails were set when the wind was favourable. The cost of towing the mostly empty or lightly loaded ships was high. Therefore, profit could usually only be made when the fairway was sufficiently deep and with fully loaded ships travelling downstream.\nIn 1828, the Stadt Frankfurt was the inaugural paddle steamer to traverse the Main between Mainz and Frankfurt. However, the venture was unsuccessful due to design flaws in the steam engine and the challenging navigation conditions in the heavily silted Main estuary. The trials were terminated as early as 1832. It was not until 1841, following the Free City of Frankfurt's accession to the German Customs Union and the completion of the Taunus Railway line from Frankfurt to Wiesbaden, that steam navigation on the Main resumed. However, it was unable to establish itself for several reasons. Firstly, the unfavourable fairways of the Main at low water levels during the summer months presented a challenge for steamboats with their relatively large draught, particularly given that the promised fairway improvements from the Bavarian state were not implemented to the desired extent. Secondly, the railway, which was constructed at the same time, was more efficient than steamships. It was able to travel at faster speeds and had shorter routes. The waterway from Mainz to Schweinfurt was 88 per cent longer. Furthermore, the railway was able to bypass customs offices, eliminating the need for lengthy waiting periods. It was also exempt from customs duties and tariffs, reducing its financial burden. As early as 1858, the unprofitability of steam navigation with paddle steamers led to the discontinuation of this mode of transport.\nThe time of chain boats on the Main\nChain boat tow on the Main (ca. 1896)\nChain boat of the Mainkette-AG in front of the \"Mainkai\" in Frankfurt\nAfter navigation on the Main had lost more and more of its transport capacity to the railway and the use of wheeled steam tugs had failed due to the shallow navigation channel of the Main, Heino Held, owner of the Mainz-based forwarding and coal trading company C.J.H. Held & Cie., had the idea of saving navigation by introducing chain tug navigation. On 15 February 1871, he applied to the authorities in Prussia, Bavaria and Hesse for a corresponding licence, encouraged by the companies that had just started up on the Elbe. In 1872, the various states and towns along the Main then established a committee in Aschaffenburg. The committee was supported by Ewald Bellingrath, who had already played a leading role in the introduction of chain navigation on the Elbe and Neckar rivers. The committee discussed the merits of chain shipping and the canalisation of the Main. Mainz, which was part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, was in fav",
    "Constituency in Seoul, South Korea\nEunpyeong B (Korean:\u00a0\uc740\ud3c9\uad6c \uc744) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Eunpyeong District, Seoul. As of 2024, 195,270 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Seodaemun\u2013Eunpyeong constituency.\nHistory\nThroughout its history, Eunpyeong B has elected members of liberal, centrist, and conservative political parties to represent the constituency. Despite conservative politician Lee Jae-oh being elected a total of five times in Eunpyeong B, in recent years, the liberal Democratic Party has been dominant in the constituency.\nDeputy Speaker of the National Assembly Kim Jae-kwang of the centre-right Reunification Democratic Party was the first member to represent the constituency. He was succeeded by Lee Won-hyung of the centre-left Democratic Party who won in the 1992 election. Lee Jae-oh made his debut in this election as the left-wing Popular Party candidate. Lee Jae-oh won the following election held in 1996 as a member of the centre-right New Korea Party, defeating incumbent Lee Won-hyung by over eight points. Lee comfortably won re-election in 2000 with 51% of the vote and narrowly won re-election in 2004 with 45.25% of the vote against Uri Party candidate Song Mi-hwa who received 43.07% of the vote. However, Lee was defeated by Moon Kook-hyun of the centrist reformist Creative Korea Party by a margin of over eleven points.\nOn October 22, 2009, Moon Kook-hyun lost his seat after he was found guilty of violating South Korean election law; specifically the political funds act. Accordingly, a by-election for the constituency was held in 2010 which saw the constituency's former member Lee Jae-oh of the conservative Grand National Party win in a landslide, securing 58.33% of the vote. In the 2012 election, Lee narrowly won re-election by a margin 1.14% against unified opposition candidate Cheon Ho-sun of the centre-left Unified Progressive Party.\nAhead of the 2016 South Korean election, incumbent Lee Jae-oh was not re-nominated as the Saenuri Party's candidate for Eunpyeong B. This move came as the Saenuri Party's pro-Park Geun-hye faction grew influential within the party and denied renomination for many party members considered to be anti-Park or pro-Lee Myung-bak. In response to this, Lee left the Saenuri Party on March 23, 2016, and announced his intention to run as an independent candidate on the following day. The Saenuri Party decided not to nominate a candidate in the Eunpyeong B constituency on March 28, 2016. Despite this, Lee Jae-oh failed to win re-election, being defeated by Kang Byung-won of the liberal Democratic Party who won with 36.74% of the vote. Kang won re-election in 2020, garnering 57.41% of the vote. Kang was not re-nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate ahead of the 2024 election after being defeated by Kim Woo-young in a party primary. Kim won the general election with 56.95% of the vote, defeating People Power Party challenger Chang Seong-ho by a wide margin.\nBoundaries\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Gusan-dong, Daejo-dong, Jingwan-dong, Bulgwang-dong, and Galhyeon-dong. The constituency is bordered Goyang B to the north and west, Eunpyeong A to the south, and Jongno to the east.\nList of members of the National Assembly\nElection results\n2024\n2020\n2016\n2012\n2010 (by-election)\n2008\n2004\n2000\n1996\n1992\n1988\nSee also\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\nNotes\n^ Independent from March 23, 2016\n^ Unified opposition candidate with the Democratic United Party\n",
    "Destroyer of the Royal Navy\nFor other ships with the same name, see HMS Basilisk.\nHMS Basilisk was a Beagle-class (from 1913 G-class) destroyer of the British Royal Navy. The Beagles were coal-fuelled ships, designed for a speed of 27\u00a0kn (31\u00a0mph; 50\u00a0km/h) and armed with a 4\u00a0in (102\u00a0mm) gun and two torpedo tubes. Built by J. Samuel White and launched in 1910, Basilisk was initially commissioned into the First Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth. In 1912, the warship joined the Third Destroyer Flotilla before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet as part of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla in 1913. As the First World War approached, the destroyer was based in Alexandra, Egypt, but was swiftly redeployed to Malta, followed, in 1915, by action in the Dardanelles Campaign. After the Armistice of 1918 that ended the war, Basilisk was initially transferred to the Nore and then sold in 1921 to be broken up.\nDesign and development\nMain article: Beagle-class destroyer\nBasilisk was one of the Beagle-class destroyers ordered as part of the 1908\u20131909 shipbuilding programme.  The vessels were coal-burning after concerns had been raised about the availability of fuel oil in time of war and the bridge was larger and higher than previous designs. This reduced costs, although it also meant that five boilers were needed, the extra machinery meaning that deck space became more premium. The Beagle-class vessels were not built to a standard design, with detailed design being left to the builders of individual ships in accordance with a loose specification, in this case J. Samuel White. The class were also known, on occasion, as the Basilisk class, named after this vessel.  In October 1913, as part of a wider renaming of the Royal Navy's warships into classes named alphabetically, the class was renamed as G-class.\nBasilisk was 275\u00a0ft (83.8\u00a0m) long, with a beam of 28\u00a0ft (8.5\u00a0m) and a draught of 16\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (5\u00a0m). Normal displacement was 976 long tons (992\u00a0t). Five White-Forster boilers fed direct-drive Parsons steam turbines driving three shafts. Two funnels were fitted. The machinery was rated at 12,000 shaft horsepower (8,900\u00a0kW) giving a design speed of 27\u00a0kn (31\u00a0mph; 50\u00a0km/h). During sea trials, the destroyer reached a speed of 27.984\u00a0kn (32.203\u00a0mph; 51.826\u00a0km/h) at a displacement of 968 long tons (984\u00a0t). Up to 226 long tons (230\u00a0t) of coal was carried, giving a design range of 2,000 nautical miles (3,700\u00a0km; 2,300\u00a0mi) at 15 knots (28\u00a0km/h; 17\u00a0mph). The ship had a complement of 96 officers and ratings.\nArmament consisted of one 4\u00a0in (102\u00a0mm) BL Mk VIII gun forward and three 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns aft. Torpedo armament consisted of two 21\u00a0in (533\u00a0mm) torpedo tubes, one placed forward and the other aft. Two spare torpedoes were carried. On 8 April 1916, the Admiralty approved fitting the destroyer with depth charges. Two depth charge launchers and two charges were carried.\nConstruction and career\nBasilisk was laid down by J. Samuel White at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight with the yard number 1293 on 11 May 1909, and launched on 9 February the following year. The ship cost \u00a3109,729. Basilisk was the ninth to serve in the Royal Navy named for the mythical creature. The vessel was commissioned at Portsmouth and joined the First Destroyer Flotilla on 17 September.  In 1912, a reorganisation of the Home Fleet resulted in the ships of the Beagle class forming the Third Destroyer Flotilla. The vessel remained part of the Third Flotilla in March 1913. Basilisk was transferred, along with the rest of the class, to the newly-formed Fifth Destroyer Flotilla as part of the Mediterranean Fleet.\nAs the First World War approached, Basilisk was part of the Second Division of the Fifth Flotilla and based in Alexandria. The destroyer sailed to Malta, joining the rest of the flotilla on 9 August. The island had a coal shortage, which restricted the vessel's activity. On 6 August 1914, the Second Division was deployed searching for the German warships Goeben and Breslau but this was curtailed by a lack of fuel. On 18 August, the destroyer was deployed to Suez to deter the Ottoman Empire from restricting British access to the Suez Canal. From 25 October, the destroyer, along with sister ship Racoon, patrolled the Gulf of Suez. The ship subsequently joined the force based in the Suez Canal and Red Sea to protect the sea lane for Allied shipping.\nOn 19 November, Basilisk sailed for Tenedos and spent the next year supporting the naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign. In preparation for the assault, the Admiralty decided to attack the defences on the Dardanelles strait with the pre-dreadnought battleships Albion, Majestic and Triumph. The attack was largely ineffective as the troops moved the batteries so they were safe from bombardment. On 26 February 1915, Basilisk, alongside Racoon, escorted the battleships Cornwallis, Irresistible and Vengeance as they attempted to land parties to attack the batteries. This was also largely i",
    "\nThe CF-V21P is a notebook-sized laptop released by Panasonic in 1993. It was the first notebook computer to have an integrated CD-ROM drive as an option, albeit it only supports up to 3.5-inch-diameter mini CDs instead of standard 4.7-inch-diameter discs. It was discontinued in 1994.:\u200a111\u200a\nSpecifications\nOn its release in October 1993, the stock CF-V21P featured an Intel i486SX microprocessor clocked at 25\u00a0MHz, initially upgradable to a 50-MHz i486DX2. Later, the company made the i486DX4 clocked at 75\u00a0MHz available as a processor upgrade. The stock amount of RAM on the motherboard is 4\u00a0MB, expandable to up to 20\u00a0MB with aftermarket RAM cards. The notebook was sold with either 80\u00a0MB or 120\u00a0MB internal hard disk drives, with a 450\u00a0MB drive later made an option on the high-end. For a pointing device, Panasonic built the CF-V21P with a trackball positioned at the center of the palm rest, with the left- and right-click buttons to either side of it.\nFor screen technology, the notebook was optioned with either a 9.5-inch monochrome STN display; a 10.4-inch color TFT display; or a 9.5-inch STN touchscreen with pen stylus. The screen housing can be detached from the bottom housing and either removed (for upgrading); or flipped around and closed onto the keyboard, making the laptop able to be operated like a tablet computer (useful when equipped with the touchscreen display). All displays were native VGA resolution: 640\u00a0\u00d7 480 pixels. The on-board graphics chip contains 1\u00a0MB of on-die VRAM, supporting a maximum resolution of 1024\u00a0\u00d7 768 pixels at 256\u00a0colors on an external monitor.\nBesides the two type-II or one type-III PC Cards, the CF-V21P supports a number of optional accessories via a multibay slot on the side of the computer\u2014trademarked by Panasonic as the \"Multimedia Pocket\". In this multibaby fits either a 3.5-inch floppy drive, a second NiMH battery, a TV tuner card (allowing the laptop to be used as a television receiver), or a CD-ROM drive. The lattermost option made the CF-V21P the first notebook computer on the market to have an integrated CD-ROM drive as an option. However, it was hamstrung by the nonstandard maximum dimension of its supported media\u20143.5-inch-diameter mini CDs\u2014for which very little commercial software on the market was available on its release. This option may have appealed to companies purchasing fleets of the CF-V21P, who likely had contracts with CD-ROM mastering facilities to manufacture proprietary software packages relevant to internal company functions; or to those who had access to early CD-R burners (which in 1993 were very expensive).\nPanasonic also offered for the CF-V21P a port replicator and a docking station, the latter of which houses 16-bit ISA slots for yet more options, including a Pentium upgrade board and a capture card to store analog video onto the hard drive. As stock, the CF-V21P has no on-board audio; Panasonic sold a 16-bit PC Card sound card to allow the notebook to classify as a multimedia PC. Depending on the configuration ordered, the CF-V21P weighs between 5.7 to 8.2 pounds (2.6 to 3.7\u00a0kg).\nDevelopment\nThe CF-V21P was designed and manufactured by Panasonic in Japan. The company's plants were equipped to produce between 40,000 and 50,000 units of the CF-V21P in a 12-month period. The company produced the LCD panels in-house, while Intel provided the chipset and Western Digital provided the on-board graphics chip.:\u200a210\u200a\nReception and legacy\nAnush Yegyazarian of PC Magazine concluded that the CF-V21P \"offers a lot of flexibility for upgrading (or downgrading) to suit most user needs, but  lags in performance. Specifically, he rated the computer's raw number-crunching performance below-average, as was its hard drive performance, although graphical performance scored high marks. Clare Newsome of PC User found the notebook \"an impressive piece of design which takes notebook modularity and upgradability to a new level. Unfortunately this level is both beyond the budgets of many users and the developments of software vendors, who have yet to accept the 3.5-inch CD format\". PC World's Bryan Hastings called the TFT display of his review unit \"luxurious\" and was impressed by the large hard drive but found the battery life subpar and the notebook overall overpriced for most users.\nPanasonic followed up the CF-V21P with the V41 in late 1994, which added a full-sized CD-ROM drive.:\u200a111\u200a\nNotes\n^ IBM's ThinkPad 755CD, released in 1994, was the first notebook computer with a full-sized CD-ROM drive.:\u200a111\u200a\n^ PC Week remarked that Panasonic was likely unable to meet the high demand for the CF-V21P.\n",

    "1994 film by Richard Munchkin\nGuardian Angel is a 1994 American action film directed by Richard W. Munchkin, starring Cynthia Rothrock, Lydie Denier, Daniel McVicar and Marshall R. Teague. Rothrock plays a cop-turned-bodyguard on assignment to protect a rich playboy from an unhinged woman, who is both the client's former mistress and the criminal responsible for the death of the heroine's fianc\u00e9. Although contemporary reviews were mixed, it is better regarded than most of the actress' American output.\nPlot\nCast\nCynthia Rothrock as McKay\nDaniel McVicar as Hobbs\nLydie Denier as Nina\nMarshall R. Teague as Nick\nKen McLeod as Ostendorf\nJohn O'Leary as Clayton\nAnna Dalva as Goddard\nRobert Miano as David\nBrian Brophy as Slick\nMatthew Walker as Lippy\nArt Camacho as Jimmy Lee\nDan Doherty as Issac\nProduction\nDevelopment and filming\nGuardian Angel was Rothrock's first and only collaboration with action specialists PM Entertainment. The company was typically reluctant to hire women in leading roles due to their limited track record in the genre, but gave her a chance based on the performance of some of her movies. Filming took place in the Los Angeles agglomeration between July 26 and September 3, 1993. The fictional \"Dick's Bar\", where Rothrock's character brawls with a group of thugs, was represented by the Yukon Belle in Thousand Oaks, once a legitimate criminal hangout that fell victim to the area's gentrification a few years after filming.\nStunts\nRothrock's frequent screen partner Richard Norton contributed to fight choreography. A Mexican performer, hired by the production despite his limited credentials, was grazed by Rothrock during filming, and tried to extort them $250,000 due to an allegedly broken nose. Rothrock denied causing him any lasting damage, and the man quickly lowered his demands to a fraction of the initial amount. Co-star Lydie Denier was inspired to take kickboxing classes after witnessing Rothrock in action. The film marked the debut of veteran stuntwoman Anita Hart, who was introduced to PM stunt coordinator Cole McKay by a mutual friend. Playing the killer maid, she got her high fall on the first take and went on to become a PM regular herself. Although Rothrock performed her fight scenes, some of PM's trademark setpieces required the use of a stunt double, such as the horse chase. Reflecting the company's hectic shoots, the wig worn by the rider visibly slipped during the scene but it could not be redone, and the mishap had to be worked around in post-production. The character of Goddard, a fellow cop who helps the heroine commandeer the Cigarette Lady speedboat for the final chase, was played by its real-life owner and competitive driver Anna Dalva.\nRelease\nIn the U.S., Guardian Angel was released on VHS by Imperial Entertainment on November 23, 1994. It reached Australia the same month via 21st Century Pictures, under the title Beyond Justice, and the U.K. the previous July through Guild Home Video. The film received a domestic DVD re-issue on May 4, 2004, from Kreative Digital Entertainment via Universal Music & Video Distribution, as part of a slate of PM Entertainment releases.\nReception\nGuardian Angel received mixed reviews from mainstream publications. TV Guide criticized the inclusion of another ill-fated companion for Rothrock, but noted the novelty of the femme fatale antagonist played by Denier, and ultimately deemed that \"it's McVicar's tongue-in-cheek turn as the Robert Wagnerian poor little rich boy that makes Guardian Angel watchable, if hardly a standout.\" Ballantine Books' Video Movie Guide wrote: \"Martial arts expert Cynthia Rothrock is back in this pedestrian effort about an ex-cop out to avenge the deaths of her partner and lover.  Novelty here is the killer is a woman. Anyone for a good cat fight?\"\nBritish reference book Elliot's Guide to Home Entertainment called it \" violent actioner that serves merely as an adequate showcase for Rothrock\u2019s fighting skills.\" Pat Gillespie of Australian newspaper The Age described Rothrock as \"stilted but likeable\".

The confirmation hearing for Mishustin is scheduled to take place on the same day.\nEven before Mishustin's nomination, the deputy head of the United Russia faction, Yevgeny Revenko, said that the faction would support any candidate for the post of Prime Minister proposed by Vladimir Putin. Since United Russia has more than half of the seats in the State Duma, this means that Mishustin would become Prime Minister, even if all other parties voted against it. After Mishustin's consultations with the parliamentary factions, the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party, A Just Russia \u2013 For Truth and New People also expressed support for Mishustin.\nThe Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, after meeting with Mishustin, said that his faction would abstain from voting. According to Zyuganov, the communists have prepared proposals for the work of the future government, and the party will be ready to support Mishustin only if he confirms his readiness to implement them.\nIn accordance with the current version of the Constitution, the State Duma, in addition to the Prime Minister, will have to approve all deputy Prime ministers and most federal ministers. Their candidacies must be nominated by the Prime Minister after his appointment and approval of the Cabinet structure. At the same time, the Ministers of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Justice and Emergency Situations are nominated and appointed by the President after consultations with the Federation Council.\nState Duma confirmation\nPrime Minister\nMishustin at his confirmation hearing on May 10, 2024\nMikhail Mishustin was confirmed as Prime Minister on 10 May 2024\nDeputy Prime Ministers\nState Duma held hearings on candidates for the positions of Deputy Prime Ministers and confirmed them on 13 May 2024.\nFederal Ministers\nState Duma held hearings for the positions of Federal Ministers and confirmed them on 14 May 2024.\nFederation Council consultations\nOn May 14, 2024, the Federation Council held hearings on the proposed candidates for the posts of Ministers of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Justice and Emergency Situations.

In addition, Slutsky proposed appointing Ulyanovsk regional deputy Viktor Bout as the head of the agency responsible for aviation issues.\nOn 11 May 2024, President Vladimir Putin approved the structure of the Cabinet of Ministers.

On the same day, Mikhail Mishustin nominated candidates for the positions of Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers.\nOn 12 May 2024, President Vladimir Putin nominated candidates for the positions of Ministers of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Justice and Emergency Situations. Of the five ministers, four retained their positions.

France says we are independent now but we have no independence, we are modern slaves. They say this is an Africa problem, but we have had enough of what France is doing to us; it\u2019s as if we\u2019re still in the 15th century.\u201d\n\u2014Vocalist Mdou Moctar on the political themes on Ilana (The Creator)\nIlana (The Creator) is a 2019 studio album by Nigerien desert blues band Mdou Moctar. The album was the first where the guitarist Mdou Moctar converted his solo musical project into a full band and has received positive reviews by critics.\nReception\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Ilana (The Creator) received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 from 5 critic scores. J.\u00a0D. of The Economist wrote that this album \"mastery of Moctar's craft\" as a guitarist as this album \"makes use of brilliant and dense fingerpicking as well as the power chords favoured in hard rock\" Reef Younis of Loud and Quiet scored this album a 7 out of 10, summing up his review \"few have stories as compelling as Mdou Moctar but, as \u2018Ilana (The Creator)\u2019 testifies, he also has the Saharan sounds to back it up\". NPR's Bob Boilen called this \"the most insane psychedelic guitar album of the 21st century\" and recommended that listeners come at it \"with the volume cranked\". Editors at Pitchfork Media scored this release 8.0 out of 10 and critic Andy Beta praised this release as \"an incandescent set of guitar music with a spontaneous, celebratory air\u2014and a latent urgency reflecting the region\u2019s very real difficulties\". At PopMatters, Adriane Pontecorvo rated this album a 9 out of 10, writing that the album builds on the desert blues tradition and yet \"still sounds fresh and different from anything Moctar\u2019s contemporaries do, but it is wholly based on his considerable skill as a rock guitarist and songwriter rather than on trying to get in on current trends\".\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Mahamadou \"Mdou Moctar\" Souleymane.\n\"Kamane Tarhanin\"\u00a0\u2013 5:08\n\"Asshet Akal\"\u00a0\u2013 4:51\n\"Inizgam\"\u00a0\u2013 1:24\n\"Anna\"\u00a0\u2013 4:33\n\"Takamba\"\u00a0\u2013 2:50\n\"Tarhatazed\"\u00a0\u2013 7:27\n\"Wiwasharnine\"\u00a0\u2013 3:38\n\"Ilana\"\u00a0\u2013 4:46\n\"Tumastin\"\u00a0\u2013 4:21\nPersonnel\nMdou Moctar\nMikey Coltun\u00a0\u2013 bass guitar, recording, production\nMazawadje Aboubacar Ibrahim\u00a0\u2013 drums\nAhmoudou Madassane\u00a0\u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMdou Moctar\u00a0\u2013 lead guitar, vocals\nAdditional personnel\nRobert Beatty\u00a0\u2013 artwork\nAroudaini Daniel\u00a0\u2013 djembe\nHeba Kadry\u00a0\u2013 audio mastering\nChristopher Kirkley\u00a0\u2013 production\nChris Koltay\u00a0\u2013 recording\nRigo Luis\u00a0\u2013 photography\nSeth Manchester\u00a0\u2013 mixing\nCem M\u0131s\u0131rl\u0131o\u011flu\u00a0\u2013 drum programming\nAnna Viotti\u00a0\u2013 photography\nSee also\nList of 2019 albums\n",
    "Norwegian politician\nBjarne Store-Jakobsen (born 12 January 1944) is a Norwegian politician, activist, and journalist. In 2005, he was elected to the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Norway as a member of the Labour Party. He was selected by the S\u00e1mi parliament to serve as a representative for the Sami People of Norway at the Working Group on Indigenous Peoples at the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, where he would serve as leader. He served as an advisor for the President of the S\u00e1mi Parliament Egil Olli until his dismissal in 2011. He would later leave the Labour Party and serve as the leader of the S\u00e1mi People's Party.\nPrior to his time in politics, Store-Jakobsen served as a spokesperson and unofficial leader for the Sami people protesting against the development of the Alta Hydroelectric Power Station during the Alta controversy. Store-Jakobsen worked in the film and television industry as a journalist for 15 years, working for Nordlys, S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi, and Sveriges Television. His life is depicted in the 2014 film Bihtto\u0161, directed by his daughter, Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers.\nEarly life and career\nStore-Jakobsen was born on 12 January 1944 in the village of Karlebotn and was raised in the village of Vesterelv (Nesseby). He met his wife Esther Tailfeathers at the 1981 World Council of Indigenous Peoples General Assembly in Canberra.:\u200a187\u200a\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, amid the Alta controversy, Store-Jakobsen served in a leadership position for the \u010cSV S\u00e1mi rights movement. He was dubbed the \"brains behind\" the movement,:\u200a177\u200a for Sami activists challenging the development of a hydroelectric plant, the Alta Hydroelectric Power Station, by the Norwegian government on the Altaelva. He served as the spokesman for the Sami who were undergoing a hunger strike at the Storting to oppose the development,:\u200a195\u200a citing the dam's subsequent threat to flood the S\u00e1mi community of Masi, and as an assertion of self-determination on their pastoral lands. Store-Jakobsen opposed the development on the grounds that individuals in the reindeer husbandry sector were opposed to the development, and the importance in protecting the nature in the area. As an activist, he was referred to with the nickname Bihtto\u0161 Bierna (Rebel Bjarne). Amid the confrontation, Store-Jakobsen stated that he was allegedly contacted by several European terrorist organizations, whose assistance he turned down. During the confrontation, Store-Jakobsen insisted that the protests be exclusively peaceful, refusing a proposal to sink the Janina, a ship used to house police officers, citing that the action would be a violent escalation.\nA trained journalist, Store-Jakobsen worked in the film and television production industries for 15 years, working as a journalist and editor. Prior to January 1978, Store-Jakobsen worked for Nordlys as a correspondent for Alta,:\u200a102\u200a quitting over management of the Sami editorial line.:\u200a102\u200a In the 1980s, Store-Jakobsen worked for the newspaper S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi in Karasjok, as its editor.:\u200a186\u200a:\u200a187\u200a In 2003, he was working as the head of the Sami editorial department for Sveriges Television in Kiruna. As of 2007, Store-Jakobsen was a member of the Sami Film Association.\nPolitical career\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Store-Jakobsen was elected to the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Norway in the 2005 Norwegian S\u00e1mi parliamentary election, representing the Midt-Troms constituency as a member of the Labour Party (Ap). During his time in the Sami parliament, he served as a member for the business and culture committee.\nIn 2008, Store-Jakobsen was appointed by the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Norway as the representative of the Sami people of Norway at the Working Group of Indigenous Peoples in the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC). He was appointed for a second time in 2010, continuing to represent the Sami people of Norway. During his time in the BEAC, he served as head of the Working Group of Indigenous Peoples. As part of BEAC, Store-Jakobsen led the \"Vyngy syo\" (Voice of the Tundra) project, aimed at organizing Nenets language broadcasting in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. In his capacity as leader for the working group, he was critical of Russian government programs targeting Indigenous people's relationship with alcohol and the failure to provide alternative employment for communities. He called for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide financial support and prevent the bankruptcy of Kola S\u00e1mi Radio. The position oversaw the attempted implementation of the reindeer husbandry industry within the Sami of the Kola Peninsula with the project \"Obsjina Kildin\".\nIn June 2011, Store-Jakobsen was removed from his post of advisor to the President of the S\u00e1mi Parliament of Norway. Incumbent President Egil Olli cited the need for renewal in the post, stating that the then 67-year-old man was too old for the position, while Store-Jakobsen cited internal power struggles as the reason for his ouster. Amid the confrontation, Olli revealed that Store-Jakobsen discussed with him ",
    "Government chartered private colony\nAguairenda was the site of a colony of American families founded by William H. Murray in the Tarija Department of Bolivia. Murray selected the location after deciding to try and found a colony in the Gran Chaco. The colony was sanctioned by the Bolivian government between 1923 and 1928, when the colony's charter was revoked and Murray returned to Oklahoma.\nHistory\nAguairenda was the site of a Catholic mission in Bolivia selected by William H. Murray as the location of his Bolivian colony. Murray negotiated with Bautista Saavedra's government for a colony in Bolivia, this time in the Tarija Department twelve miles north of Yacuiba. He received 42,000 acres under a 99-year lease for $1,800. He agreed to settle 25 families by December 31, 1925, and the colony had its export taxes waived. While Saavedra supported the colony, Flores Adolfo from the Tarija Department argued against the colony being built on traditional Indian lands in his district. Proponents of the colony advocated it as a buffer between Paraguay and was approved by the Bolivian Congress in 1923.\nColonists were required to follow the laws of Bolivia and a code of laws personally written by Murray. Amongst Murray's laws were a ban on brothels and saloons, a requirement to build a poultry shed within two years, a law that Murray owned all agriculture equipment, and a requirement he must personally approve all land transfers. Any change to the laws required a majority vote and Murray's consent. He barred colonists who were members of labor unions, socialists, Republicans, or born outside the United States. 41 families signed up with 15 leaving on May 4, 1924. About 80 colonists boarded the Oroya in New Orleans before sailing through Havana, the Panama Canal, to Antofagasta, Chile. The caravan then traveled by rail to Tartagal and then on foot to the Tarija Department through the Andes Mountains. The group arrived at Aguairenda, the colony site, on June 18, 1924.\nThe colonists immediately discovered much of the best land in the area was already leased by local Indigenous people. Colonists, mostly living in the school run by the local Catholic mission, were dissatisfied with the colony's poor living conditions. Most colonists left by the end of 1924 and Murray returned home in June 1925 to recruit more colonists. Later that year he shifted to trying to recruit Indians from their village at El Palmer. With the shift in strategy, the colony grew to nearly 400 and ran Bolivia's first cotton gin. Conflict in the Bolivian Legislature led President Hernando Siles to demand he create a profitable cotton colony or relinquish his concession. His lease was cancelled on August 6, 1928, and Murray transitioned to raising cattle before finally leaving Aquairenda on July 24, 1929.\nNotable residents\nWilliam H. Murray\nJohnston Murray\n",

    "\nJos\u00e9 Cuevas vs. Thomas Hearns, billed as World War II, was a professional boxing match contested on August 2, 1980, for the WBA welterweight title.\nBackground\nFollowing an impressive 28\u20130 start to his career, Thomas Hearns was installed as the top contender to WBA welterweight champion Jos\u00e9 Cuevas with the bout being announced in June 1980 to take place in August in Hearns hometown of Detroit, Michigan. The 21-year old Hearns had won all but two of his 28 fights by knockout while the 22-year old Cuevas was in the midst of a four-year reign as WBA welterweight champion and had knocked out 11 opponents in his 12 title fights dating back to 1976, though at 6'1\", Hearns possessed a four-inch height advantage over the 5'9\" Cuevas. Hearns claimed to have \"no fear\" of Cuevas and stated \"If I see an opening to get my right hand on him, then I think I'll knock him out.\"\nThe fight was scheduled shortly after the heavily hyped and much watched Leonard\u2013Dur\u00e1n fight in which Dur\u00e1n had defeated Leonard to win the WBC's version of the welterweight title.

    "German merchant and poet (1836\u20131868)\nAbraham Peter Carl Siebel (13 January 1836 \u2013 9 May 1868) was a German merchant, poet, and friend of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. His pseudonyms were Emil Thilva and Julius Morton.\nLife\nBorn Abraham Peter Carl Siebel, in Barmen, Germany, he was the son of the lace manufacturer Karl August Siebel (1805 \u2013 1888) and Emilia (Emilie) Kampermann (1812 \u2013 1878). After being tutored by a private teacher, he attended the Barmer City School and then a higher school in Rheydt. In 1850, his father determined that he should apprentice in the family firm \"Abraham Siebel & Son.\" He was not very fond of the profession and therefore turned to poetry. His friends were Emil Rittershaus and Hugo Oelbermann. Together they founded the Wuppertal poets' circle. Later, he joined the Sonntagskr\u00e4nzchen (Sunday gathering) of Friedrich Roeber.\nFrom 1852, Siebel was associated with the literary journal Morgenblatt f\u00fcr gebildete Leser (Morning paper for educated readers) and its editor Hermann Hauff. From 1853 to 1866, Siebel corresponded with Wolfgang M\u00fcller von K\u00f6nigswinter. Between 1854 and 1858, he wrote eleven letters to Nikolaus Hocker\u00a0.\nBetween 1856 and 1859, he spent a considerable amount of time travelling in Berlin and Manchester, where he met Friedrich Engels in 1859 and Wilhelm Wolff. In May 1859, Siebel was to report as a reserve soldier to the Prussian Guard in Berlin.\nHe participated in a festival marking the centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birth in Manchester on 10 November 1859, with the poem \"Epilogue\".\nSiebel (top-left, glasses) in an 1859 caricature by Johann Richard Seel\u00a0\nIn 1860, he returned to his homeland to marry on 14 November 1860. His wife was Eleonora Augusta Christina Reinhilda (Reinhilde) Freiin von Hurter (1842\u20131880). The marriage produced three children: Emilie Maria Siebel (b. 1862), Anna Reinhilde Siebel (b. 25 August 1863), and Carl Reinhold Siebel (b. 17 August 1867).\nIn May 1861, Karl Marx visited him in Elberfeld. In 1864, Siebel founded a section of the International Workingmen's Association in Barmen.\nDue to a chest ailment, he travelled to Funchal on the island of Madeira for healing purposes in 1866 and 1867.\nSiebel supported Karl Marx through reviews and advertisements in the German press to promote Marx's Das Kapital throughout 1867.\nShortly after his return from Madeira, he died of consumption in Elberfeld on 9 May 1868\u2014he had lost weight quickly in the fortnight before his death, and was planning to travel to the Rhine. He was buried in the Bartholom\u00e4usstra\u00dfe Cemetery in Barmen.\nLegacy\nGerman politician Johann Viktor Bredt called him a \"poet by divine grace\" in 1937, while Friedrich Engels summarised him in a letter to Jenny Marx on 22 December 1859: \"Give me Siebel any day; he may be a rotten poet, but he does at least know that he is a thorough humbug and all he asks is to be allowed to advertise himself\u2014nowadays a necessary proc\u00e9d\u00e9  without which he would be a complete nonentity.\"\nThe poet Eduard M\u00f6rike expressed negative opinions about the quality of his poetry in a letter to Karl von Gr\u00fcneisen on November 17, 1860.\nFrom the year 1865, four letters from Siebel to Wilhelm Jordan are preserved. Two letters to Gottfried Kinkel are in Kinkel's literary estate, two letters to Karl Gutzkow are kept in Frankfurt, and one letter to Paul Heyse is in the Munich State Library.\nWorks\n"
