    "Stormont will have four new MLAs after Friday's general election results - without any by-elections.\nFour out of Northern Ireland's seven new MPs will leave Stormont to take up their seats on the green benches at Westminster. \nSorcha Eastwood, Jim Allister, Alex Easton and Robin Swann are to be replaced at Stormont - for Lagan Valley, North Down and North Antrim - through a process known as co-option. \nThe co-option system is used to fill vacancies at Stormont. \nThe process most commonly takes place after an election, resignation or death. \nStormont's elected politicians are allowed to run in Westminster elections when they are Assembly members.\nBut it's against the current rules to be both an Assembly member and a Member of Parliament at the same time.\nOnce seats become vacant, the co-option process can take place, as laid out in Section B of the Northern Ireland (Elections) (Amendment) Order 2009.\nStep one is for the party of the MLA to nominate a replacement within seven days.\nThe Chief Electoral Officer will then write to the nominee asking them to confirm within seven days that they are willing and able to take up the post. \nIn the case of independents, it's up to them to choose their replacements. \nBefore his death, the late David McClarty chose Claire Sugden to replace him in the East Londonderry seat. \nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra, Alex Easton said he felt a weight of responsibility in choosing who to co-opt into his MLA seat.\nHe said: \"The electorate matter a lot to me and its important that I try and get things right.\"\nHe admitted that there were plenty of \"rumoured names\", throughout the election period, but he hopes to \"make an announcement at the end of the week.\"\nMr Easton said the decision hasn't been easy as \"not everybody fancies being an MLA and all of the baggage that goes with that, it\u2019s a big thing for people to undertake.\"\nAnd then there are council co-opts. \nOne of the MPs elected on Friday was Sinn F\u00e9in's Mid Ulster District Councillor Cathal Mallaghan. \nThe co-option system also applies to council seats.\nMr Mallaghan's election as the MP for Mid Ulster in the Westminster election means the party will have to find a replacement for his council seat. \nPerhaps the most high profile co-opt was deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly's co-option into the former DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson\u2019s Lagan Valley Stormont seat in May 2022.\nThe parties are yet to confirm who the new replacements will be.\nAlliance have already said that former MP Stephen Farry will not take Sorcha Eastwood's Lagan Valley seat after he lost North Down to Alex Easton.",

    "A team of residents is campaigning to clear up streets in its local community.\nThe Better Streets campaign group said they would no longer accept or tolerate overflowing bins, waste and an \"epidemic of fly-tipping\" on pavements in St Pauls, Bristol.\nAs part of the campaign, they launched an exhibition at the Vestibules, City Hall, which highlighted the impact of waste through a series of installations.\nA spokesperson for Bristol Waste said they \"share residents' frustrations\" and \"encourage the reporting of fly tipping\".\nThe exhibition, called Better Streets St Pauls, ran from 1 to 5 July.\nIt included installations such as a living room full of fly-tipped waste and blown-up photos of rubbish around the area.\nCampaign leader Tara Miran said the exhibition was built on the \"passion and frustration\" about the situation felt by the community.\nShe explained the work on display was \"a call to action\" to address the \"massive divide\" experienced by residents in different areas of the city. \nMs Miran said: \"I walk up to Clifton everyday and I can feel the change within myself when I walk out of the area.\n\"I feel free, I just feel less stressed because your environment affects you like that - that shows the intensity of the problem.\"\nShe described the issue as \"broken window syndrome\" - a metaphor for disorder within neighbourhoods.\nShe added: \"Everyone's used to it [the rubbish]... people are coming in to fly-tip. \n\"They know that St Pauls is the place to go to because you'll get away with it.\"\nEmma Reynolds, the artist and photographer behind the exhibition, has lived in the area for about 15 years and described the littering as \"very bad\". \nExplaining the motivation behind the artwork on display she said: \"We're bringing a human element.

    "The new government has made tackling NHS waiting times a key priority - and this week appointed NHS surgeon and former health minister Lord Ara Darzi to investigate what is going wrong. Is productivity the place to start?\nThe scale of the challenge facing Health Secretary Wes Streeting was made clear as he announced the review on Thursday. The latest performance figures \u2013 the first published since the election - showed the hospital backlog had risen again for a second month in a row, hitting 7.6 million. The British Medical Association called it a \"shameful\" legacy for the Tories to leave.\nIn its manifesto, Labour insisted it had a plan to tackle this - creating an extra 40,000 appointments and operations a month, by getting the NHS to do more at weekends as well as using the private sector more.\nIt has pointed to hospitals in London and Leeds that have had great success in doing weekend working, which has allowed them to improve efficiency through high-intensity use of operating theatres. Surgeons carry out the operations across two theatres with one being used to operate on the patient, while the next patient is readied in the other.\nBut these are the exceptions. If you look across the entire NHS, hospitals have actually struggled to increase activity despite more money being invested and more staff being employed. Compared to five years ago, spending after inflation has risen by nearly a fifth and the workforce by nearly a quarter, yet the number of patients starting treatment for things such as knee and hip replacements, has barely increased.\n\nThe strikes by junior doctors and other staff seen over the past year have had an impact. NHS England estimates that during 2023-24, 350,000 more treatments would have been started if there had been no industrial action. But even that leaves hospitals well short of what you would have expected, if treatments had gone up by as much as spending and staffing.\nIt is a similar picture if you look at all types of treatment, including follow-up checks and pre-treatment tests and scans, not just those starting their core treatment and therefore coming off the waiting list.\n\n\nThis productivity puzzle \u2013 as the Institute for Government (IfG) calls it \u2013 has been a cause of concern at the heart of government for some time.\nDuring an election debate in front of health leaders last month, a candid Lord Bethell, who served as a health minister in the last government, said the Treasury had become \"sick to death\" of pouring money into the health service only to see productivity fail to improve: \"They [the Treasury] believe the return on investment is terrible.\"\nBut it is not just in the corridors of Westminster that the perception has developed. The public is also concerned, according to Anna Quigley, research director at Ipsos UK: \"Generally around eight in 10 say they are willing to pay more tax to fund the NHS. But they also say it needs to make changes - cut out waste and inefficiency.\"\nThe temptation is to assume it was the pandemic that threw a spanner in the works \u2013 after all it led to a dramatic fall in treatments being done, and the waiting list to balloon. Could it be that the NHS is still recovering from the shock of that?\nThe IfG analysis of the problem published last year suggests not.\nFocusing on treatments is just one rather blunt mark of productivity, so the IfG looked at a range of different measures - and found the NHS actually started to become less productive in the late 2010s after about 15 years of improving productivity.\nIt was clear, the IfG concluded, the pandemic may have pulled the trigger, but the gun was loaded well before Covid struck. \nThe Nuffield Trust has come to a similar conclusion in an analysis published this week, pointing out the NHS has struggled more than other countries, such as Finland and Spain, to get waiting times down since the peak of the pandemic. \nIt's director of research Sarah Scobie says the new government faces an \"enormous uphill battle\" to get the NHS back on track.\n\n\n\n\nSo what's causing the problems? In a system as complex as the NHS there will never be a single reason for something.\nThe lack of spending on buildings is a key factor, the IfG said.\nAs funding has been squeezed, the repair bill for the NHS estate has been creeping up and stands at \u00a311.6bn \u2013 a rise of 13.6% on the previous year.\nThe consequence of this is that every year thousands of patients see their care disrupted because of incidents relating to infrastructure problems.\nA BBC investigation earlier this year found problems including patients waiting for dialysis being sent home because of water supply issues, power being lost in operating theatres and sewage leaking into patient areas.\nThe lack of spending on buildings and equipment \u2013 known as capital spending \u2013 also means the NHS has one of the lowest number of scanners among rich nations, creating a bottleneck for tests to diagnose health problems. The lack of 21st century IT systems is another well-known ",
    "The UK government's new business secretary has said \"job guarantees\" will form part of the negotiations with steel giant Tata about its Port Talbot site.\nJonathan Reynolds said there was \"a better deal available\" on the future of the plant, but said newer technologies would employ fewer people.\nThe previous Conservative government agreed a \u00a3500m rescue package to help keep the plant open and shift to greener production methods, but 2,800 UK jobs would still be lost.\nMr Reynolds said he and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had already spoken to Tata and were involved in active negotiations over the Port Talbot plant's future.\n\"I'm going to make sure that job guarantees are part of the negotiation that we're having,\" he told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.\nPressed on whether that meant he could guarantee all jobs, he responded: \"Blast furnaces employ more people than some of the newer technologies available.\n\"So there's a range of things you have to understand but I absolutely agree with the point that we have to make sure that this is a transition which works for working people and that they're part of that.\"\nMr Reynolds said the timescale for the government's negotiations was \"not a large one\".\nHe said Labour's manifesto had pledged \u00a32.5bn on top of the \u00a3500m already agreed by the former government.\n\"It's not about underwriting loss making businesses in perhaps the way we might have thought of industrial policy in the past. It is about being a partner for investment in the future,\" he said.\n\"There is more money available for the steel industry under our plans for government, but that's about making sure we make this transition with the private sector together and recognise how we have to make sure that decarbonisation is not de-industrialisation and we've got to do that together.\n\"But there is a better deal available for Port Talbot and the steel industry as a whole - I'm sure of that.\"\nPort Talbot residents had mixed views of the latest developments.\nRachel White lives near the steelworks, but does not think it has a long-term future.\n\u201cI know a lot of people who work there who were obviously really concerned in the first place when they found out they were going to lose their jobs, but they\u2019ve gone on to find better jobs for the next generation but the steelworks is never going to be a long-term solution,\" she said.\n\"I understand they need to find the money for the people who do need the jobs but I feel like a bit more effort could be made in future-proofing for when it does eventually have to go.\n\"It\u2019s good for the people who haven\u2019t found anything else. I just think they could do a bit more work on what are the other options. \n\"We live really close to the steelworks and most people would complain about how dirty it is and the effect it has on the environment and on people\u2019s houses.\nNigel Hunt, who runs a clothing shop in the town, thought the minister's comments did not go far enough.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be empty words frankly,\" he said. \"I think what they need to do is nationalise a foundation manufacturing industry, an industry that makes world-class steel.\n\"It makes huge quantities of it and it sells because there is a huge demand for it because there is still a manufacturing industry. The automotive industry, aerospace, tin plate and defence, they\u2019re all Port Talbot steel.\n\"What\u2019s going to happen to that manufacturing base if this industry goes?\u201d\nBefore he retired Donald Gwyne-Cooke was a steelworks employee, but he believes steelmaking's time in the town is over.\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer it closed down myself because of the pollution. I don\u2019t like to see people losing their jobs but there are other jobs.\u201d\nChris David said: \u201cIt\u2019s the only infrastructure in this town and people rely on it. This has been going on for a number of years now and it\u2019s the backbone of this town and without it it\u2019s going to be difficult for everyone.\n\"The government says a lot of things, but whether they\u2019ll act on it is another thing.\n\"They\u2019ve got to show commitment, otherwise nobody\u2019s going to believe them. This new government coming now, hopefully they\u2019ll do something about it and back the people of Port Talbot because they\u2019re hard working and they need some support.\u201d\nThe idea of future investment offers a glimmer of hope for those who are seeking to mitigate the impact of Tata's plans.\nLabour had discussed supporting future investment in Port Talbot during the general election campaign, and Tata bosses had been open to the idea.\nBut future investment will not save jobs in the short term. Even Tata Steel's existing commitment to building an electric arc furnace next year will require far fewer workers than are currently employed in the heavy end of blast furnace production.\nUnite union general secretary Sharon Graham said the steel industry had been decimated.\nShe said it needed investment, job guarantees and procurement legislation that \"all UK infrastructure projects should use UK steel\".\n\"We need to back British steel, we need to ba",
    "Face-to-face talks between the new health secretary and junior doctors unhappy over pay have begun. \nWes Streeting says the government cannot afford or commit to the 35% rise the doctors want but hopes to end the dispute. \nBut there is renewed optimism an agreement might be reached to avoid more strikes and disruption for patients. \nTens of thousands of appointments were postponed during the most recent walkout by doctors, earlier this month.\nThere have been 11 rounds of strikes by junior doctors in England already. That has put extra pressure on an already overburdened NHS that has more than seven million patients on waiting lists for treatment.\nThe doctors say their pay has fallen in recent years, as a result of inflation, and have called for a rise to restore what they say they are due.\nThey received a rise averaging nearly 9% in the last financial year.\nTalks last year with the British Medical Association, which represents the junior doctors, about an extra 3% top-up did not reach an agreement.\nIt has since said it is willing to have the 35% pay rise phased in, after initially calling for it in one go, but government stands firm.\nMr Streeting told the Tony Blair Institute Future of Britain conference: \"This is an important reset moment I think in the relationship between junior doctors and their government.\"\nLabour had been very clear in opposition the headline pay demand was unaffordable - and that \"has not changed\".\nJunior doctors deserved respect and being honest with them was key to that. \nBMA junior doctors committee co-chairs Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi said: \"Mr Streeting has said pay restoration will be a journey: we are looking to set off.\n\u200b\"We thank the Secretary of State for the meeting and have agreed to meet again next week.\"\nDr Laurenson added: \"This was definitely a collaborative talk, and I think it's fair to say we have no plans at the moment to call for strike action.\"\nThe new government faced a number of other \"burning deck\" issues left by the Conservatives, Mr Streeting said.\nTop of the list is reducing patient waits. \n\"Cutting waiting times is my immediate focus and number-one priority,\" Mr Streeting  said. \nSince December 2022, a number of NHS staff groups have taken strike action - including nurses, other doctor groups, physiotherapists and paramedics - causing the postponement of nearly 1.5 million appointments, procedures and operations at an estimated cost of more than \u00a33bn.",
    "The mother of rescued Israeli hostage Noa Argamani has died, three weeks after her daughter was freed in a dramatic raid after being held for eight months by Hamas in Gaza.\nLiora Argamani, who was born in China, had suffered from brain cancer. She was 61.\nLiora released a video in December, pleading with Hamas to release her daughter, saying: \"I don\u2019t know how long I have left. I wish for the chance to see my Noa at home.\"\nNoa was rescued on 8 June, when Israeli commandos raided an apartment where she was being held in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. Three other hostages were rescued from a nearby apartment at the same time.\nAn image of Noa being dragged away in terror on the back of a motorcycle by Hamas gunmen became one of the most widely recognised pictures of Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. \nSome 251 people - Israelis and foreign nationals - were taken hostage when Hamas burst through the border in the unprecedented attack in which about 1,200 people were killed.\nThe attack triggered the war between Israel and Hamas. At least 37,900 people have been killed by Israel's military offensive in Gaza, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says. \nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum - a collective of relatives and friends of people taken hostage on 7 October - said it \"bows its head\" at the news of Liora's passing.\nIsraeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife \"grieve from the bottom of our hearts for the passing of Liora Argamani and share in the family's grief\".\nOn Saturday night, a video message from Noa, in which she spoke publicly for the first time since her rescue, was played at a protest in Tel Aviv calling for the release of the remaining hostages.\n\"As an only child to my parents, and a mother suffering from a terminal illness, my biggest concern in captivity was for my parents,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s a great privilege to be here after 246 days in Hamas captivity, to be beside my mother after eight months of uncertainty.\"\nHamas and allied armed groups are still believed to be holding 116 hostages, including Noa's boyfriend Avinatan Or, who were taken on 7 October.

    "A former doctor who left a baby with a brain injury and a skull fracture during birth can no longer reapply to be restored to the medical register.\nDr Ahmed Loutfi was originally struck off the medical register after a fitness to practice hearing in 2016, relating to misconduct at hospitals in Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and Hull.\nA tribunal has now indefinitely suspended his right to reapply to be restored as a practising doctor, after his second application to be reinstated was rejected.\nIn another incident, he incorrectly diagnosed a mum with an ectopic pregnancy as having had a partial miscarriage, and told her to \"go home and try for another baby\". \nThe fitness to practise hearing in 2016, which resulted in Dr Loutfi being struck off the medical register, involved several allegations which were found proven by the panel.\nIn May 2013, while working at Birmingham Women's Hospital, Dr Loutfi was found to have \"inappropriately\" rotated the baby's head with forceps during childbirth, leaving the baby with a brain injury and depressed skull fracture.\nDuring a subsequent investigation, the doctor claimed he had delivered another patient through the same means while being supervised by another doctor, when he knew this was untrue.\nThe tribunal also heard that in April 2010, while working at the Liverpool Women's Hospital, Dr Loutfi incorrectly diagnosed a patient as having had an incomplete miscarriage twice, despite the fact she had already had a scan and been told she had an ectopic pregnancy.\nDuring his first consultation with her, he told her she should be discharged home with paracetamol for pain relief, and on the second, that she should go home and \"try for another baby\".\nTwo days later, she was taken to hospital and had a fallopian tube removed after the ectopic pregnancy was discovered.\nIn October 2011, while working at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester, Dr Loutfi was presented with a foetal blood sample result which showed severe foetal distress, giving a clear indication that the baby needed to be delivered urgently.\nHowever, he made an \"inappropriate\" decision to proceed with vaginal delivery and failed to advise immediate delivery by Caesarean section.\nAfter midwives raised concerns with a consultant, the baby was delivered by Caesarean section. \nDuring this delivery it became apparent that the mother's uterus had ruptured and she required an emergency hysterectomy.\nDr Loutfi also failed to disclose that he was subject to a warning after a fitness to practise hearing in 2010, relating to an assault of a colleague in March 2009, in two job applications.\nThe applications were to the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Hull and East Yorkshire Women and Children's Hospital.\nAfter making his second application to be restored to the medical register, a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in June concluded that it was not satisfied that Dr Loutfi was fit to practise, and has indefinitely suspended his right to reapply for restoration.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Authorities in Florida and Tennessee have accused a social worker of helping her wife impersonate her in online therapy sessions for nearly two years.\nPeggy Randolph, who was licensed to provide therapy in both states through the platform Brightside Health, is said to have knowingly defrauded hundreds of patients.\nMs Randolph has denied the accusation, saying she did not know her wife, Tammy Heath-Randolph, who was not licensed or trained, had treated clients under her account.\nThe ruse was uncovered after Ms Heath-Randolph died in February 2023.\nAt that time, Brightside Health received a complaint from a client who had discovered through social media that Ms Randolph\u2019s wife was the one treating them, according to documents from the Tennessee Department of Health.\nWhile Ms Randolph denied knowing that her wife was treating patients on her behalf, authorities said the wife was getting paid for sessions she conducted.\nThe therapist voluntarily retired her license in August 2023 after an internal investigation by Brightside, which found she had shared her log-in credentials with her wife.\nDuring that investigation, it became apparent Tammy Heath-Randolph was seeing all of Peggy Randolph\u2019s patients on-line, \"and had been for a long time\", said an investigative report by the Florida Department of Health.\nMs Randolph  worked for Brightside Health from January 2021 to February 2023 and was supposedly providing therapy to \u201chundreds of clients\u201d in that timeframe, Tennessee health authorities said.\nShe is said to have carried out the ruse so that she had time to see other patients in person.\nIn addition to losing her license to practice, Ms Randolph was also ordered to pay a $1,000 (\u00a3788) penalty.\nBecause Ms Randolph voluntarily surrendered her license, the investigation against her was dropped and no further information was provided by either authorities on the nature of evidence against Ms Randolph or her now-deceased wife.\nThe case only became public recently after Florida and Tennessee released documents related to Ms Randolph\u2019s conduct in May.\nIt was first reported by BBC\u2019s US news partner CBS.\nHannah Changi, a spokesperson for Brightside, told CBS News that as soon as the company learned of the allegations, it fired Ms Randolph and reported her to state licensing authorities.\nShe did not provide a firm number on how many patients were impacted \u201cdue to the nature of the incident and ongoing legal proceedings,\u201d but said the company had refunded all impacted patients.\n\u201cWe're extremely disappointed that a single provider was willing to violate the trust that Brightside and, most importantly, her patients had placed in her,\u201d Ms Changi said in a statement.",
    "A woman who got burnt with boiling water and hit by her ex-partner has said a local domestic abuse charity saved her life. \nKey Crawford, 34, has been helped by The Wish Centre in Blackburn, which runs a refuge and offers counselling.\nShe is one of many survivors in the borough who seek help there, with the local organisation reporting a 200% increase in demand for its mental health support. \nMs Crawford said: \u201cIf [Wish] wasn't here for me then I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\nShe has experienced domestic abuse and coercive control in previous relationships and told BBC Radio Lancashire: \u201cI didn\u2019t cook pasta right so I got burnt with the water because I\u2019d done it wrong.\n\u201cIf I ever answered back I\u2019d get hit, things like that constantly.\n\u201cI had to do everything right.\u201d\nShe said an ex-partner strangled her after she found messages on his computer to another woman.\nMs Crawford said: \u201cThis is when I actually thought I was going to die.\n\u201cI did pass out and then I came back to and I ran downstairs and I locked myself in the bathroom.\n\u201cI heard him banging on the door and then he booted the door in and sort of fell into the bath and that\u2019s when I ran and I never looked back.\u201d\nIn another relationship, her partner put trackers on her phone.\n\u201cIf I\u2019d go out and spend \u00a35 in a shop I\u2019d get questioned and he\u2019d get mad about all of that,\" she said.\n\u201cI felt suffocated like I couldn\u2019t breathe, yet I was still thinking the whole time this must all be normal.\u201d\nMs Crawford, who has since been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD), has seen a counsellor and said that help changed things forever. \n\u201cI\u2019ve always said the Wish Centre saved my life,\" she said.\n\u201cIf they weren't here for me then I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\nWish said there had been a sharp increase in demand for its services since 2018. \nThe centre was set up in 1988 for women in the borough and in 2014 extended its offering to also include male victims and perpetrators. \nThe charity is using a National Lottery grant to employ a counselling co-ordinator, mental health independent domestic violence advocate (IDVA) and a wellbeing practitioner.\nThe roles are all based in the Blackburn centre, which training manager Rebekah Wilson feels is important.\nShe said: \u201c[Survivors] are already in a safe space.\n\u201cThe natural progression to a Wish counsellor is very comfortable, or it\u2019s more comfortable than it could be had they been referred in to another service.\n\u201cI think they trust us by that stage.\u201d\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit BBC Action Line.",
    "It's mid-morning and business is brisk at the butchers in Ellesmere Port's central market. \nN&N Meats is run by husband and wife Bill and Nikki Ferguson who've been in the trade for more than 30 years.\nBill says, while trade's remained steady, the last couple of years have seen people change their orders.\n\"They're buying cheaper cuts. They're not buying sirloin steaks and fillet steaks... they're buying more economically.\"\nBill says he's had to think creatively \u2013 particularly when it comes to passing on the rising costs his own business faces.  \n\"It's a bit of a balancing act \u2013 trying to put it up a bit so you're not losing money but you've got to absorb some of the cost, otherwise you're losing customers.\"\nBill's still busy \u2013 people always need food - but some other businesses are struggling. \nJo Hopewell's been running Jo's Soft Furnishings for 30 years. We're the only people at her stall.\n\"My business is getting worse and worse,\" she says.\n\"The rent is too high, electric is too high, and a lot of people can't afford to buy.  We're trying to survive.\"\nLast year average UK earnings went up by 6% -  three times higher than the rise in inflation, the Consumer Price Index, which is currently 2%.  \nBut those figures don't reflect the reality for many.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) a quarter of people in the north west of England have an income under 60% of the national average.  \nA far higher proportion of their money is spent on the basics - and those basics have shot up.\nDenise Hadley and her husband Colin are enjoying a coffee in the market's food court. She works at an after-school club on minimum wage. Colin had a stroke a few years ago and can't work.\n\"In the past few years it's been tougher to get your bills paid, and food is outrageous.  \n\"You're getting less and less for your money every time you go shopping,\" she says.\nAccording to the ONS the past two years has seen the price of food rise by 25%, nearly three times as much as the entire decade before (9%).\nDenise says she's had to cut back on luxuries. For some the word luxuries conjures up the idea of foreign holidays, but for Denise, it means fruit. \n\"It's more expensive. We just need to concentrate on the basics.\" \nDenise says it's years since they had a holiday: \"We don't go abroad at all.\"\nA few tables along Pauline Woolham is enjoying cheese on toast while her son and granddaughter demolish plates of chips.  \nPauline says she and her husband are currently financially secure, but she's worried about the younger generation. \"It's just an uphill battle. They're getting nowhere fast.\"\nPauline's particularly concerned about the lack of affordable homes, she said: \"Our youngest son \u2013 it's taken the two of them to get as high as they can before they can buy their own house.  \n\"You need at least \u00a330,000 deposit now for most places.\"\nBut saving for a house is difficult when rents are rising.  \nIn the last year alone they have gone up by an average 9% in the north west region. Again, this impacts disproportionately on those with a lower income who can't afford to buy.\nA five minute walk from the market, charity volunteers are packing shopping bags full of the kind of healthy food many can no longer afford \u2013 fruit, vegetables and fresh milk.\nTwenty-three-year-old Tyra Goodwin started Thrive to Survive with her mum and friend after her own family's experience of living in temporary accommodation. \nThe charity helps families in crisis and the numbers are rising.\nTyra says they've particularly noticed the rise in working people using the service, along with the elderly: \"We never used to have older people come and access this and now we're getting a lot more.\"\nUnlike wages, many benefits are linked to average inflation but Tyra points out that most of that money will go on food and rent, which have gone up far more sharply.\nRachel Williams volunteers with the charity but like many, has also used its services in the past. \nRachel uses a wheelchair and often has bouts of illness. She also needs frequent hospital appointments.  She says the combination of demands make it difficult to keep a job and so she is largely dependent on benefits.\nRachel says she too has cut back on healthy foods to make ends meet. Her disability means she's reliant on her car, but she no longer uses it as often as she did.\n\"Previously if there was a birthday or something like that I could do that (buy a present). If the washing machine broke I could get it fixed, but now I'm struggling to even cover the basics,\" she says.\nNationally the economy appears to be heading back up but it doesn't feel like it here.  \nFor the people I've spoken to in Ellesmere Port, life still feels tough and the future uncertain.  \nThe question is what the next government can do to change that feeling.\nA full list of candidates for the Ellesmere Port and Bromborough constituency can be found here\nWatch BBC North West Tonight on BBC One and on BBC iPlayer.

    "The man who led the campaign over the Post Office scandal says an honorary award adds another string to his bow in the continuing fight for justice.\nSir Alan Bates was awarded a honorary law doctorate by Bangor University to recognise his role, immortalised in the television drama Mr Jones Vs The Post Office.\nThe former sub-postmaster from Llandudno in Conwy, north Wales was given a knighthood in the King's birthday honours.\nHe told students at a graduation ceremony that if there was one lesson to take away from the scandal, it was to admit failures.\n\"One of the things the Post Office scandal shows quite vividly is that things go wrong,\" he said.\n\"But when things go wrong don't cover it up - because the cover-up can be worse than the crime.\"\nSir Alan lost his Post Office contract in 2003 over false claims there were cash shortfalls in his accounts.\nLike thousands of other postmasters, he was a victim of errors made by the Horizon computer software installed in all UK post offices.\nHe founded the Justice For Subpostmasters Alliance in 2009, taking on the Post Office in the courts.\nIt led to convictions against postmasters being quashed, and the launch of the ongoing Post Office inquiry.\nHowever, Sir Alan said the battle for justice continues. He has turned down offers of compensation, which he described as \"cruel\" and \"derisory\".\n\"It's not over yet, by a long chalk,\" he said.\n\"We are still negotiating. I am just one of the many that are still stuck in this position.\n\"I'm just hoping that with the new government in, that there is some resolve there to draw a line under this after all these years.\"\nHe said he hoped the honorary doctorate would help keep the campaign in the spotlight.\n\"There are still some horrendous outstanding issues,\" he said. \nAddressing students graduating on Thursday in Bangor, he added: \"People need to take responsibility for their actions, and hopefully you'll do that when you go forward from here.\"\nHe received a standing ovation, including from former Anglesey postmaster Noel Thomas, who was wrongly jailed because of the Horizon errors.\nMr Thomas was also awarded a honorary doctorate for his role in the campaign at a ceremony earlier in the week.",
    "A pre-school in Surrey has been given the lowest possible rating by Ofsted in all of its categories.\nBlackdown Pre-school, in Deepcut, was rated as inadequate for its quality of education, behaviour and attitudes, personal development, and leadership and management - as well as its overall effectiveness.\nThe inspection in June found that children's safety and welfare were not assured, the report states.\nIn its response, the school said it did not think the inspection \"accurately or fairly\" represented it, and that it was in talks with Ofsted. \nSome of the actions the school has been asked to take include implementing a safeguarding policy and ensuring a key person is assigned to every child.\nA school spokesperson said: \"While we do not fully agree with the findings, we view this as an opportunity to make positive changes. \n\"We are collaborating closely with the early years team to ensure our next inspection better reflects the true quality of our setting and the dedication of our wonderful staff, who work tirelessly to provide a happy and safe environment for the children.\"\nThe spokesperson said the pre-school sector was facing \"significant\" challenges in retaining and recruiting staff due to \"widespread issues related to pay and pressure\" and it was committed to addressing these challenges. \nOfsted said not everyone who had responsibility for the \"setting\" had been vetted to assure their suitability, there was a lack of oversight for the pre-school, and the \"lines of accountability\" were unclear - which led to several breaches of statutory requirements.\nThe inspection also found recent staff changes were not managed well, which meant some children did not have a \"key person\" to enable their care and learning needs were met effectively. \nDespite this, it found staff to be caring and children are able to chose from resources that interest them. \nThe report says: \"The manager recognises that children's language and social development have been impacted as a result of the pandemic. \n\"She has a secure understanding about the curriculum intent. \n\"However, this is not shared or understood effectively by staff.\"\nThe inspection said although most staff were qualified, teaching was \"variable and at times poor\". \nThe report said: \"Too often staff provide activities which are not tailored for children's individual needs.\n\"Although staff supervise children as they play, too often interaction is limited and staff fail to direct children to any meaningful learning.\"\nThe arrangements for safeguarding were also not effective and there was not an open and positive culture around safeguarding that put children's interests first, the inspector said.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "In Scotland it has been a night of political contrasts - celebration for Labour and catastrophe for the SNP.\nHaving turned itself into an election winning machine, the party dropped dozens of seats from the 48 it won in 2019, marking its worst performance in a general election for more than a decade.\nLosses had been expected.\nThe SNP\u2019s troubles are well known - disillusionment over a lack of progress towards independence, internal divisions over gender reform and the ongoing police investigation into party finances, to name a few.\nBut many in the SNP were shocked by the scale of defeat, as seat after seat turned from yellow to red.\nLIVE: Follow the latest election news from Scotland\nFull results from the Scottish constituencies\n'Very poor result' for SNP as Labour make gains\n\nSo what now for John Swinney and his party? And what now for the question of independence?\nAfter all, the SNP told voters a majority of Scottish seats would provide a mandate to negotiate on leaving the UK.\nOf course, the party is not about to give up on its bid for another referendum, but it seems unlikely it can shift the dial any time soon.\nMr Swinney was only in post as leader for a matter of weeks before the election was called, and therefore isn\u2019t expected to bear the blame - although many point out his role as Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s deputy, insisting all of the responsibility cannot be laid at Humza Yousaf\u2019s door.\nThe SNP leader says there will be soul-searching to do, but it\u2019ll have to be done quickly. He now faces the challenge of getting the SNP back on the front foot in time for that 2026 election.\nThat ballot now looks to be a far tougher contest, given Labour\u2019s swelling support.\nBut there are fresh challenges for Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar too \u2013 he\u2019ll need Sir Keir Starmer to deliver on at least some of his promises in the early months of the new Labour government.\nIf Mr Sarwar is to keep those votes loaned to him by independence-backing SNP supporters, Labour will also need to demonstrate it can deliver for Scotland, and that its Scottish leader can influence decisions made by Number 10.\nAfter 14 years in opposition, Labour has made a spectacular return to power at Westminster - and its majority has been bolstered by a swathe of seats in Scotland.\nIt\u2019s a result that marks a return from the electoral wilderness for the party, having won just one constituency north of the border in the 2019 general election.\nAs the party crunched its way to through seat after seat, Mr Sarwar achieved what his five predecessors had failed to do \u2013 bringing an end to the SNP\u2019s election-winning run.\nAnd Labour did so by taking votes from both the SNP and the Conservatives, with surges across the country.\nIt was the breadth of the wins that surprised many \u2013 the party had anticipated retaking closely contested seats across its traditional heartlands in the central belt, but it had hoped rather than expected to extend its reach beyond that.\nThe Scottish Labour campaign almost certainly benefitted from the momentum built by a resurgent UK Labour Party, intent on kicking the Tories out of Downing Street.\nA greater focus on issues such as the cost of living, rather than the previously dominant constitutional arguments, also ensured Anas Sarwar wasn\u2019t squeezed out of the debate by the SNP and the Tories.\nVictory will now be used as a springboard for the 2026 Holyrood election campaign - with the party mounting a serious run at Bute House for the first time in more than a decade.\nThe Conservatives had a nightmare night across the UK, with their vote share collapsing. \nThe party saw its support fall away in Scotland too, as its leader Douglas Ross failing to win his seat.\nThere had been nerves around the impact of the Reform Party \u2013 and those concerns proved valid, with the party taking votes from Mr Ross, allowing the SNP to come out on top.\nHe\u2019ll make way for a new leader, having quit mid-campaign, and the Scottish party will now have its own soul-searching to do too.",
    "Cat rescue charities in Coventry are experiencing overwhelming demand amid a rise in strays and pets abandoned by owners.\nCats Protection said it had seen a 28% year-on-year increase in cats coming into its care in the city, primarily driven by a rise in strays.\nJust this week three kittens were found loose in Ryton Pools Country Park and others dumped in Coventry in a taped-up carboard box.\nCharity co-ordinator Wendy Harris said: \"We are experiencing higher levels of stray mums and their kittens needing help than any time in recent memory.\"\nCats Protection said it had seen a 16% rise in strays in Coventry and was forced to hand-rear litters born to young cats that could not cope. \n\"Just a few weeks ago a tiny one-year-old cat came in as a heavily pregnant stray. She had eight kittens once she was in care and only three survived,\" Ms Harris said.\n\"It's something we're currently seeing time and again - it's heartbreaking.\"\nThe charity works with the RSPCA's Coventry and District branch, which says it is having to turn animals away daily.\n\"This is the worst year for cat and kitten abandonment I have seen in my 20 years working at the RSPCA Coventry,\" said Lorraine Bryan, centre manager.\nThe RSPCA said earlier this year animal abandonment was at its highest level for three years.\nThe Coventry branch, which is independently funded, has expanded its cattery to accommodate 60 animals, but is still overwhelmed.\nIt believes the increase in demand is due to a combination of factors, including the cost of vet fees and mandatory microchipping.\nOn Tuesday, rangers at Ryton Pools Country Park coaxed two kittens believed to have been abandoned into a carrier after discovering them loose in the grounds.\nA third ran off into the meadow but the two rescued were taken to the vets for treatment and staff hope they can be rehomed.\nTwo taped-shut cardboard boxes containing kittens have been found dumped in Coventry in recent weeks.\nMs Bryan said the RSPCA in Coventry was struggling to do more without further support.\n\"This is combined with a lack of interest in older cats, black cats, and those with medical issues that stay with us for longer,\" she said.\n\"If we can raise funds and increase fosterers that will be two ways of helping this crisis.\"\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Racist graffiti has been sprayed at multiple sites in Antrim, just a week after eight families were intimidated out of their homes in the town. \nSwastikas have appeared in the Stiles estate, off Fountain Hill road and on the side of the old Antrim cineplex.\nThe perimeter of a new housing estate has also been daubed with swastikas and refences to the neo-Nazi group Combat 18. \nThe appearance of the graffiti is \"particular sinister\" and has \"upset members of the Jewish community\", Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor Roisin Lynch said.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said they are investigating five  reports of racist graffiti and are treating them as racially motivated hate crimes.\nThe area's new MP, Robin Swann, has requested a meeting with officers to discuss the issue. \nLocal residents have told BBC News NI it is \"unnerving\".\nIn a statement, police said they received reports of racist graffiti daubed on properties in five areas of the town between Sunday and Monday morning. \nThe areas affected were Parkhall Road, Fountainhill, Craigmore Park, Market Street area and the Castle Mall.\n\"Local police will work with partners to have the graffiti removed, and a noticeable policing presence will continue this week in and around the Antrim and wider area,\" the statement added. \nMr Swann, from the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) was elected as the MP for South Antrim in last week's general election.\nSpeaking at Stormont, he said he was \"fully aware\" of the graffiti issue that had arisen on Monday morning.\n\"We've asked now for a meeting with the PSNI so we can get in to discuss the actual facts behind it,\" Mr Swann told reporters. \n\"But the sectarian nature and the racist nature of the paintings and graffiti that has been in there this morning, Combat 18, swastikas painted on any house in Northern Ireland is an insult to democracy.\"\nThe SDLP's Roisin Lynch added: \"It must end now, this tiny minority do not speak for the people of Antrim and we cannot allow them to run roughshod over this community.\"\nThe new housing estate, which is still under construction, is being developed by the Choice housing association.\nLast year, the firm announced it was building a \u00a36.2m \"shared housing development\" called Fountain Hill at Stiles Way in Antrim.\nThe plan consisted of 34 homes which were to provide accommodation for families, wheelchair users and people aged over 55.\nFollowing the graffiti attack, a Choice Housing spokesperson told BBC News NI the firm was \"committed to providing secure, affordable, quality accommodation to meet the diverse needs of our tenants\". \nThey said \"the safety and security of tenants is of paramount importance to us\" and they asked tenants to contact them with any concerns. \nChoice's spokesperson added: \"These issues require a multi-agency approach and we are working with relevant stakeholders to support resolutions.\"\nIt is not just housing which has been targeted by racist graffiti. \nJaqueline Barnes and David Edmont are joint managing directors of the Bridge Association, a not-for-profit training organisation with a base in Antrim.\nMonday was the first day of trading in the Castle Mall for their Hug a Mug ability cafe which is staffed by people with learning disabilities.\nAt the back of their shop, also in the mall, the external wall was sprayed with Nazi symbols wall overnight.\nThey said they felt angry and tearful when they arrived on Monday morning to discover the markings.\nMr Edmont described recent intimidation in Antrim as a \"tsunami of racism\".\nThe graffiti followed several reports of racist and sectarian attacks in Antrim over recent weeks. \nAt the end of last month, a bungalow specially designed for nine-year-old disabled boy was one of two new-build properties that were damaged in Antrim.\nJessy suffers from spina bifida and has a range of other complex medical needs which require him to use a wheelchair.\nPolice said four people, dressed in dark clothing, threw objects at the house in the Reford Grove development in the early hours of Sunday, 30 June.\nThey are treated that incident as a sectarian-motivated hate crime.\nThen last week, an African family told BBC News NI they were leaving the home they had lived in for almost two years because of increasing racist intimidation.\nThe family said the intimidation intensified after anti-immigrant posters were erected in the Ballycraigy area at the end of May.\nTwo weeks later, 6 June, a large black X was spray-painted on their living room window.\nOn 26 June, a printed poster was taped to the window which read: \u201cIt is not racist to look after your own.\u201d  A Northern Ireland flag was printed below the message.\nOn 2 July, the windows of a car belonging to the couple were smashed. \nThe family has now moved out and said they will not be returning to the area.\nSeven other families said

    "With energy high on the new Labour government\u2019s agenda, and Scotland the first pit stop on Keir Starmer\u2019s tour of the UK nations, people are now talking about the future of Grangemouth.\nThe site near Falkirk is home to one of the first oil refineries in the UK, which is still a major supplier of aviation and ground fuels across Scotland.\nOwner Petroineos intends to cease refinery operations by 2025 and turn the site into a fuels import terminal \u2013 a move that would result in 400 job losses.\nThose plans were announced in November - but we now have 37 newly-elected Scottish Labour MPs, many of whom represent areas in the Central Belt.\nThey will feed Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s majority government, which has promised to set up a publicly-owned energy company headquartered in Scotland \u2013 the location for which has not yet been revealed.\nThis alignment has prompted questions over whether Grangemouth would be a suitable home for the energy industries of the future.\nThe oil refinery was opened by BP in 1924, the company having been persuaded by Grangemouth\u2019s transport links and availability of local skilled labour.\nIt maintained a throughput of 360,000 tonnes per year but was forced to close after the outbreak of war in 1939 as oil imports dwindled.\nIt reopened from 1946 and grew over the 1950s to meet demand for petrochemicals and fuels.\nBritish Petroleum Chemicals, which was established in 1947 to research petrochemicals, decided to locate its site next to the refinery.\nThen in the 1970s, a new source of crude oil feedstock in the shape of North Sea oil brought further business - and the opening of the Forties pipeline.\nThe 235-mile line carries crude oil from North Sea installations to the nearby Kinneil terminal and relies on the Grangemouth refinery for steam and electricity to function.\nIn 2005 the site was bought by Ineos - a company owned by Britain's richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe - in a \u00a35bn takeover.\nDisputes soon began with the Unite union over plans to end a final salary pension scheme for new workers at the plant, resulting in a strike in 2008.

    "Business owners said they were \"upset\" and \"annoyed\" after several pubs and Cambridge United's supporters' club were hit by a spate of break-ins during the last couple of weeks.\nThree venues near the River Cam in Cambridge said food and drink had been taken and parts of their businesses were damaged, with intruders captured on CCTV.\nAston Wilderspin, who lives with his young son above one of the family-owned pubs, said he could not sleep at night for fear of a third break-in. \nPolice said they were investigating raids at Cambridge United, The Green Dragon, The Wrestlers and Engineers' House.\nEngineers' House, on the Riverside, said it had been targeted three times in two weeks. \nSam Calverley, 41, a business owner at Calverley's Brewery, said during the first raid about \u00a3100 worth of drinks and cheese was taken.\n\"At that point we're a bit annoyed, but they hadn't actually done any damage as such... we just thought somebody was taking their chances.\n\"They then came back a second and third time... leaving with nothing of particular resale value... but it costs us a lot to replace.\"\nOn the second break-in a bin was \"piled up with various bottles\" and taken. On the third occasion, Mr Calverley said smashed bottles were found near the pub. \nHe added: \"We have been upset and annoyed by it. It's surprising how much time it takes dealing with the after-effects of a break-in.

I can't sleep at night, especially when I have a one-year-old son,\" he said.\n\"I don't know when they are going to come back and I'm waking up to check the cameras in the house. \n\"After the first time I tried to stay awake... when I woke up I saw our camera had been turned to face the wall and they had broken in again.\"\nA spokesperson from another pub said their site had also been raided twice on the same week.\nThey said they were concerned about a \"lack of police presence\" after hearing about similar incidents.\nA Cambridge United spokesman told the BBC the Abbey Lounge was targeted.\nThere was very little damage, not much was taken and the supporters' club did not want to comment.\nCambridgeshire Police said it was investigating. \nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Scotland's biggest music festival will search fans for single-use vapes as part of a push to improve sustainability.\nTRNSMT will return to Glasgow Green this weekend, with Liam Gallagher, Gerry Cinnamon and Calvin Harris all set to headline.\nThe vape ban was in place last year, but organisers have stepped up efforts to stop the disposable pens from littering the site.\nFestival director Geoff Ellis said he hoped those who attend the three-day event \"only leave footprints\" when the site is packed up. \nAs well as single-use vapes, concertgoers will be banned from taking in flags, glass and selfie sticks.\nMr Ellis said: \"It\u2019s purely from a sustainability point of view in the same way that we\u2019ve banned plastic on site as well. \n\"We try to do what we can in terms of sustainability and we try to encourage the audience to do the same.\"\nCCTV and police detection dogs will be present at the entrance to the site and across the park.\nAsked if he thought the single-use vape ban would be easy to enforce, he said: \"Yes. I think it\u2019s about communication. \n\"If you get the message out there to people, people listen. If you tell them not to bring stuff, they tend not to bring them. \n\"We\u2019ve got a fairly rigorous searching system at the gate with the stewards anyway.\u201d\nLast year the Glastonbury Festival added single-use vapes to its list of things not to bring to the event.\nIn February, the Scottish government confirmed plans to ban the electronic devices by next April due to health and environmental concerns. \nThe festival has previously been criticised for the gender split on the line-up.\nThis year it is roughly even, but only seven out of the 24 acts on the main stage feature women.\nTRNSMT has been running since 2017 but only one women has been involved in headlining the festival - Pulp keyboardist Candida Doyle in 2023.\nLast year's main acts also included Sam Fender and The 1975.\nMr Ellis said: \"All three headline acts are male acts, there\u2019s no denying that. \n\"But I think all festivals do what they can to improve gender balance and at TRNSMT this year, we\u2019ve actually over 50% of acts that identify as female. \n\"It\u2019s not the three headliners so there\u2019s still work to be done, and work to be done with developing artists.\"\nHe said that a lot of the acts are from Scotland because \"developing homegrown, grassroots talent has always been a focus\".\nMr Ellis added: \"Gerry Cinnamon played the very first TRNSMT on the King Tut\u2019s stage and now he\u2019s headlining this year.\n\"We\u2019ve got people like Dylan John Thomas and The Snuts coming through on a very similar path as well.\n\"It\u2019s very important to help develop new artists, like on the River stage with people like Rianne Downey.\n\"Then she played the main stage with Paul Heaton last year - I think Rianne Downey and Paul Heaton were among the standouts of Glastonbury this year as well.\"\nIn terms of weather for the weekend, sunny intervals are expected when TRNSMT kicks off on Friday and a couple of light showers and a gentle breeze are expected over the weekend.\nMr Ellis said: \"I think the weather will be Scottish but as far as rain goes, Scotland\u2019s been doing better than the rest of the UK recently. \n\"The forecast is looking decent for the weekend so fingers crossed. \n\"When I was walking around the site yesterday it felt like summer has finally reached Scotland so hopefully it stays for a few weeks yet.\"\nThe festival director said there was \"no greater buzz\" than seeing the audience arrive and explore the site.\n\"A lot of them are at the main stage and enjoying the big artists, as you\u2019d expect,\" he said. \n\"But they're also discovering the little things on site like the Big Feed food area, the cocktail bars, the sponsor activations, the chill-out area. \n\"You see that energy and passion in the audience that makes it an outdoor show in Glasgow like nowhere else.\"",

    "The government is facing growing calls to scrap the two-child benefit limit, in next week's King's Speech - including from its own MPs.\nMany Labour MPs oppose the limit as they say it increases child poverty.\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer has said he is \u201cnot immune\u201d to those arguments but scrapping it is currently unaffordable.\nSome Labour MPs are hoping for a change of heart next Wednesday, when the new government formally sets out the laws it wants to bring in over the next year.\nKim Johnson, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, has already said she plans to lay \"an amendment to the King's Speech calling for the cap to scrapped\" if plans do not change.\nIn a post on social media, Ms Johnson said the move would \"immediately lift 250,000 children out of poverty\".\nOne new Labour MP told BBC News: \u201cWe just need to be patient and wait for the King\u2019s Speech,\u201d adding, with a grin: \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic.\u201d\nThe number of children affected by the two-child benefits cap increased to 1.6 million in the year to April, Department for Work and Pensions data shows, while 440,000 households had their benefits cut, an increase of almost 8%.\nThe policy \u2013 introduced by the previous, Conservative government \u2013 prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017.\nScrapping the policy this year would cost the current, Labour government \u00a32.5bn, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. \nThe size of Labour's Commons majority means it could easily see off even a significant rebellion of its own MPs, as well as opposition party votes.\nBut Mr Starmer may be anxious to avoid an early showdown over an issue about which many of his MPs feel strongly.\nIn a social-media post, City of Durham Labour MP Mary Kelly Foy said: \"Too many families in the North East are affected by the two-child limit. We need to scrap the cap.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats have not ruled out tabling an amendment in Parliament next week to increase pressure on the Labour leader.\n\"Let's see what's in the King's Speech,\" leader Sir Ed Davey said when asked if his party would take such a step. \n\"We believe that the strength of the arguments are so good that the government will be forced to listen.\"\nGreen Party MP Sian Berry said: \u201cGreens would scrap the cap immediately and we are making plans to work through every means we can and with anyone we can cross party to push ministers to scrap this cruel policy.\u201d\nThe Scottish National Party has long called for the two-child cap to be abolished but the party\u2019s heavily reduced group of MPs has yet to decide on a strategy in Parliament for pressuring Labour to scrap it.\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage has also spoken out against the two-child cap.\nOlympia, a performing-arts teacher, lives with her husband, who works in retail distribution, and has a daughter, seven, and two sons, six and two.\nAnd the family, from Redcar, Teesside, have had their benefits capped due to the  two-child limit.\n\u201cMy son has never had a new school jumper because I know he will fit into my daughter\u2019s,\u201d Olympia, who asked for her surname to be withheld, told BBC Radio 4's Woman\u2019s Hour programme.\n\u201cThere have been instances, especially when it comes to the end of the month, where we\u2019ve had to improvise and be like, \u2018There\u2019s no cereal, there\u2019s a tin of beans to go between three children.'\n\u201cWhat makes my first two children more important than my third?\n\"As a mum, I feel like I\u2019ve failed.\"\nOlympia said she was \u201cvery aware\u201d she and her husband had chosen to have the children but added a little bit of help would make a huge difference.\nCapped households, 59% of whom are in work, lose up to about \u00a33,500 a year in benefits for their third and each subsequent child, Resolution Foundation analysis shows.  \nAnd while 41% of children in large families were living in relative poverty in 2016-17, when the policy was introduced, that proportion is set to rise to 51% by the end of this Parliament.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much evidence to show that the policy has achieved its stated aims of boosting employment and reducing the number of children families have,\u201d Lalitha Try, from the Resolution Foundation, said.\n\u201cBut there is clear evidence of the financial losses that affected families are facing, and rising rates of poverty.\u201d\nWork and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said: \u201cWe will work to give every child the best start in life by delivering our manifesto commitment to implement an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty,\u201d \n\u201cI will hold critical meetings with charities and experts next week to get this urgent work under way.\u201d\nSasha Das Gupta, who co-chairs left-wing Labour campaign group Momentum, said: \u201cLabour cannot simply promise a \u2018strategy\u2019 on this - we need to scrap the cap and promote bold policies for all. \n\"That\u2019s what real Labour values look like.\u201d\nMomentum is preparing to launch an online tool to put pressure on MPs to scrap the two-child benefit cap.\nIt will be the first time Labour\u2019s new intak",
    "The US says the floating pier designed to increase the amount of aid getting into the Gaza Strip will \u201csoon cease operations\u201d, less than two months after it was installed.\nThe announcement came after the US military were unable to re-anchor the pier this week because of \u201ctechnical and weather-related issues\u201d. It had to be removed on 28 June because of bad weather.\nA Pentagon spokesman said more than 8,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid had been delivered from the pier while it was in operation.\nHe also stressed that it had always been intended as a temporary solution.\nUS officials suggested it would remain in place until August or September, when changing sea states in the Mediterranean might make it impossible to maintain.\nIn fact, the weather proved challenging almost as soon after it started operating on 17 May.\nFor a flagship scheme first announced by President Joe Biden in his State of the Union address in March, the JLOTS (Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore) has had a brief, chequered history.\nFollowing stormy weather in late May, four small landing craft involved in the operation broke loose and were washed ashore.\nDays later, parts of the pier were removed and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs.\nIn mid-June, the whole structure, built by US engineers at a cost of $230m (\u00a3178m), was taken to Ashdod, again because of the weather.\n\u201cTemporarily relocating the pier will prevent structural damage caused by the heightened sea state,\u201d the Pentagon said at the time.\nThe pier was re-anchored on 19 June, but operations paused again, less than a week later, \u201cfor scheduled maintenance activities\u201d.\nThe scheme was also buffeted by heavy political weather.\nWhen Israeli commandos rescued four hostages from the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp on 8 June, a video showing an Israeli helicopter taking off near the pier triggered speculation on social media that US forces were involved in the rescue.\nThere was no evidence of American involvement, but the Pentagon was forced to issue a strongly worded denial.\n\u201cThe temporary pier on the coast of Gaza was put in place for one purpose only,\u201d it said. \u201cTo help move additional, urgently needed lifesaving assistance into Gaza.\u201d\nAmerica\u2019s role as Israel\u2019s chief military and diplomatic backer meant that the pier was always likely to be the focus of Palestinian suspicions, however unfounded.\n\u201cWhen the pier has worked as intended, it supplied Gaza with much needed aid,\u201d one Gaza-based aid worker said.\n\u201cHowever... its involvement in perceptions of partiality reduced its sustainability.\u201d\nFor a scheme designed to improve the provision of humanitarian aid, at a time when Israel\u2019s military campaign had left many Gazans on the brink of starvation, what difference did it make?\nJoe Biden said the pier would \u201cenable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day\u201d.\nAt the end of June, US Central Command (Centcom) said more than 8,831 tonnes of aid had been delivered, with more than half of that arriving over the course of the previous week.\nBut it also announced yet another setback, saying that \u201cdue to anticipated adverse weather\u201d, the pier had to be moved back to Ashdod once more.\nIt was due to be reinstalled this week to deal with a backlog of aid that has accumulated in Cyprus and on a floating dock moored off the Gaza coastline.\nBut on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Maj Gen Pat Ryder announced that Centcom personnel were unable to re-anchor the pier to the shore.\n\u201cThe pier and support vessels and equipment are returning to Ashdod where they will remain until further notice. A re-anchoring date has not been set,\u201d he said.\nHe added: \u201cAs highlighted in the initial deployment announcement, the pier has always been intended as a temporary solution to enable the additional flow of aid into Gaza during a period of dire humanitarian need, with limited access, supplementing land and air channels of delivery.\"\n\"The pier will soon cease operations, with more details on that process and timing available in the coming days.\u201d\nThe total delivered so far represents a tiny fraction of what is needed.\nAccording to the UN, about 500 aid trucks entered Gaza every day before the start of the war between Israel and Hamas last October.\nThe comparisons are imprecise, but over the course of two months, the US pier has delivered roughly the equivalent of one day\u2019s pre-war aid delivery.\nAnd getting the aid ashore has only been part of the challenge. Delivering it, safely, to the people who need it is extremely hazardous.\nWith Israeli troops this week mounting a fresh ground operation into nearby Gaza City, ensuring safety for aid workers remains as challenging as ever.\nThe breakdown of law and order throughout the Gaza Strip as a result of Israel\u2019s relentless targeting of anyone associated with Hamas, including police officers, means that looting - whether organised or opportunistic - is still rife.\nAid that has made it ashore has often remained stuck in the Israeli-controll",

    "Two universities have won court orders enabling them to regain control of campus land where pro-Palestinian protests by students have been taking place for several weeks.\nThe universities of Nottingham and Birmingham had taken separate legal actions, in order to the end the occupation of areas where tents had been set up since May.\nOn Tuesday, the High Court granted summary possession orders, which decided the cases in the universities' favour without a full trial.\nMr Justice Johnson concluded the protesting students had been trespassing, and said there were \"many other ways\" activists could exercise their right to protest. \nThe orders cover the University of Nottingham's Jubilee Campus, where there were up to15 tents, close to the Advanced Manufacturing Building.\nThey also cover the University of Birmingham's \"Green Heart\" outdoor area on its Edgbaston campus, where there were more than 80 tents last month, as well as its Exchange building in the city centre and the Selly Oak campus.\nDuring hearings in London last week, the judge was told that the camps were part of nationwide protests at British universities.\nThe protesters alleged universities are \"complicit\" in the loss of life in Palestine and should \u201cdivest\u201d from links to arms firms.\nThe two universities had taken legal action against two named activists and \"persons unknown\", as they have been unable to identify many protesters. \nMariyah Ali, 20, from Walsall, was the only named defendant in the Birmingham case.\nMs Ali was \u201cdisheartened by this judgment, but remains committed to her cause\", said Oliver Edwards, her solicitor said.\nHe added Ms Ali was considering appealing against the ruling.\nFormer student River Butterworth, 24, from Warwickshire, had been the sole-named protester in the Nottingham legal challenge.\nReferring to why a full trial should not be heard in the case, Mr Justice Johnson concluded protesters had had \"no real prospect\" of showing the universities had breached their duties, or that an order would infringe their human rights.\nThe London School of Economics won a separate court order in May that barred encampments in one of its buildings, where students had slept for more than a month in support of Palestinians in Gaza.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A detective has been sacked for asking a junior colleague to secretly add comments to a witness statement during a murder investigation.\nDet Sgt Imran Rafiq was part of the police inquiry into the killing of Pauline Quinn, who was battered to death in her Nottinghamshire home in November 2021.\nAfter one witness statement was taken, Det Sgt Rafiq told a colleague to fill in an incomplete sentence with the words she thought the witness had said, and \"not to tell anyone\", a gross misconduct hearing was told.\nNottinghamshire Police said on Thursday his actions amounted to gross misconduct and he was dismissed without notice.\nLawrence Bierton, 62, murdered Mrs Quinn 18 months after being released for the second time while on licence for killing Elsie Gregory, 73, and Aileen Dudill, 79, at their home in Rotherham. \nBierton was found guilty of Mrs Quinn's murder and sentenced to a whole-life order at Nottingham Crown Court in December.\nThe witness statement taken by Det Sgt Rafiq's less experienced colleague was never submitted as evidence, as the witness declined to provide a second statement when approached again in December 2022.\nThe misconduct hearing was told the missing wording in the statement was highlighted by the murder investigation team.\nDet Sgt Rafiq was then said to have told the graduate investigator to \u201cfill it in\" with the words she thought the witness had said and \u201cnot to tell anyone\u201d.\nThe statement was resubmitted to the investigation team, with Det Sgt Rafiq explaining the error by saying \"we pressed undo by accident and found the bit we lost\u201d.\nThe officer later claimed the instruction to secretly fill in the gaps in the statement from memory was a joke that \"had gone terribly wrong\", and that he'd been trying to involve his junior colleague in \"some banter\".\nHe was accused at the hearing, which ran from Monday to Thursday, of \"cutting corners\" by encouraging his colleague to \"manipulate\" the statement.\nEmails containing both the incomplete and altered witness statements were also found to have been deleted about three weeks after the incident.\nThe graduate investigator, who at the misconduct hearing rejected the idea it was a joke, was so concerned she informed senior colleagues.\nThe misconduct hearing was also told the graduate investigator had concerns about language used by Det Sgt Rafiq in connection with a separate investigation.\nWhile discussing the murder of another woman, he was said to have told his colleague: \"Let this be a life lesson to you, don\u2019t go sleeping around.\"\nDet Sgt Rafiq denied having any recollection of saying those words, and claimed, if he had said anything along those lines, she may have \"got the wrong end of the stick\".\nNottinghamshire Police\u2019s professional standards directorate (PSD) carried out an investigation into both matters.\nThe gross misconduct hearing considered alleged breaches of standards of professional behaviour around honesty and integrity, authority, respect and courtesy, plus discreditable conduct.\nChief Constable Kate Meynell said: \u201cThe people of Nottinghamshire are entitled to expect far better conduct from their police officers.\n\u201cHis decision to encourage a junior colleague to manipulate a witness statement was totally unacceptable.\n\u201cIn doing what he did as the more senior detective in this case, he put a graduate investigator with less experience in a difficult position.\n\u201cThankfully, they did the right thing and reported it to the senior investigation team.\n\u201cThis misconduct hearing also heard he used inappropriate and misogynistic language to colleagues while discussing an incident where another woman was murdered, which was abhorrent and not what I'd expect from any officer.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or Instagram.

    "A former police officer who married a convicted murderer and led a secret life of offending has been jailed for her role in her husband's organised crime gang.\nStephanie Heaps - now Ramsden - joined Greater Manchester Police (GMP) as a constable in Bolton in July 2019, when she was already embroiled in criminal activity.\nHer husband Leon Ramsden was involved in money laundering, drug dealing, and a conspiracy to burgle an address in St Helens, Merseyside, in November that year.\nHeaps, 32, of Runcorn, Cheshire, admitted offences including conspiracy to commit burglary and was jailed for four years and three months at Bolton Crown Court.\nGMP said Heaps did not declare she was in a relationship with Ramsden, who is serving a life sentence for murder, when she worked as a prison officer in Lancashire from March 2018 - before later joining the force and also failing to do so.\nBut GMP's anti-corruption unit was tipped off about her links to Ramsden and began investigating her in September 2019.\nIt uncovered evidence of Heaps often visiting Ramsden in prison, contacting him via illicit phones he had in his cell and sharing sensitive police information with him.\nOn one occasion while on duty, Heaps also failed to arrest a wanted domestic abuse suspect while responding to an incident, due to the suspect being an associate of her husband.\nShe was arrested in January 2020 and resigned from the police weeks later.\nIn October 2022 she pleaded guilty to offences including conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to transfer, conceal and convert criminal property regarding the money laundering of Ramsden\u2019s drugs money. \nShe also admitted misconduct in a public office.\nShe was barred from policing at an accelerated misconduct hearing in October 2023.\nRamsden, already behind bars, has been sentenced to five years and seven months, to run concurrently with his current sentence.\nDet Ch Insp Jennifer Adams said: \u201cDuring our investigation, we were shocked by the actions of Stephanie Heaps and her brazen disregard for the standards required for both her roles in the police and the prison service.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear Heaps should never be trusted to serve the public, and it is testament to the investigation team that she was only in uniform for a matter of months.\u201d\nAlan Richardson, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \u201cStephanie Heaps knew her actions created a serious conflict of interest and entirely compromised the trusted positions she held.\n\u201cShe will now face the consequences of her actions.\u201d\nFour other people, all from Bolton, were also sentenced.\nPhilip Markland, 40, of Bardon Close, was jailed for 22 months for conspiracy to commit burglary.\nLee Ramsden, 52, of Bleak Street, was sentenced to 15 months, suspended for 18 months, for conspiracy to transfer, conceal and convert criminal property.\nClifford McCarthy, 35, of Larkfield Grove, was sentenced to 15 months, suspended for two years, for conspiracy to transfer, conceal and convert criminal property.\nJoanne Campbell, 48, of Gisburn Avenue, was handed a term of 13 months, suspended for 18 months, for conspiracy to transfer, conceal and convert criminal property.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A prison taken over by the government after a series of failings is \"in crisis\" and \"not safe enough\", a new report has found.\nHMP Lowdham Grange saw six deaths in custody in 2023 in the months after it transferred from Serco to Sodexo, the first time a prison had moved from one private contractor to another in the UK. \nIn the new report, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB), a statutory body, said conditions had been hampered by illegal drugs, \"associated violence\" and inexperienced staff.\nThe Category B jail was taken over on an interim basis last December, but the government confirmed it would be a permanent move in May after another highly critical report.\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said there had been \"positive change\".\nA report by the IMB, published on Friday, said that in 2023, Lowdham Grange was affected by \"some fairly unique circumstances\" relating to the transfer of responsibility from Serco to Sodexo, which it said was done with \"very little guidance or experience\".\nAfter Sodexo took over, concerns the board had \"regarding safety and the overall functioning of the prison escalated\", with further \"increasingly worrying events\" also attracting attention.\nIn March last year, after the transition, three inmates died in custody, including David Richards, former head of the Dreamboys stripper group.\nAnother prisoner died in October, with two more deaths in custody taking place in November.\nInquests into the deaths of the three prisoners in March 2023 are set to take place at Nottingham Coroner's Court in September, with dates for the other three inmates yet to be confirmed.\nThe IMB said inspectors carried out a visit in January, but \"no meaningful or insufficient progress has been made since their May 2023 inspection\".\n\"Safety in the prison deteriorated throughout the whole reporting period,\" the report said.\n\"Outcomes are being strongly influenced by the ready availability of illegal drugs along with the associated violence, combined with inexperienced staff who lack the skills and confidence to successfully manage often difficult prisoners.\"\nThe IMB said more than 50% of mandatory drug tests carried out by the end of the year were positive, up from 35% in May 2023, with \"daily incidents of prisoners being under the influence of psychoactive substances and/or alcohol\".\n\nDrones have \"increasingly\" been used to bring in \"unknown numbers\" of drugs, the report said, while a cleaning product was removed after \"widespread evidence\" it was being used to create the drug Spice.\nA search of the prison also found \"substantial stashes of weapons, phones and other contraband\" in four of the five house blocks, while the jail was said by the IMB to be \"filthy, dirty and rubbish-strewn for the majority of the year\".\n\"Poor living conditions contributed towards instability and unrest among prisoners,\" the report said.\nPrisoners in need or at risk of self-harm are not being supported, the IMB said, with healthcare services \"under great pressure\" and mental wellbeing \"a significant concern\" due to \"prolonged periods of time spent by prisoners alone in their cells\".\nWhile mentioning fewer opportunities for activities and education at the prison, the IMB also \"noted with great sadness and regret\" the in-house TV channel led by prisoners \"has been abandoned\".\nThe IMB criticised the response of Sodexo managers to its attempts to raise concerns, saying it is \"disappointed to report that it struggled to garner co-operation\".\n\"[The] working relationship with prison staff and management may not be as strong as in previous years with the prior prison operator,\" the report said.\n\"While the board recognises that there has been a weakened and continually changing carousel of [leadership] members for the whole year, the work of the [IMB] has been frustrated time and again by failures of Sodexo managers to respond to legitimate enquiries and requests about issues affecting prisoners, and to keep the board updated on ongoing investigations.\"\nA Sodexo spokesperson said Lowdham Grange \"is a prison facing a unique set of challenges\", and said the company had \"worked tirelessly\" with the prison and probation service \"to improve stability and deliver the significant improvements expected\".\n\u201cAt this time, we are focused on working alongside the MoJ and [prison and probation services] to ensure a safe, secure and seamless transfer for everyone who lives and works at the prison,\" they said.\nThe MoJ said: \"The prison system is in crisis and we are gripping the situation.\n\"As the Chief Inspector recognised, there has been positive change since we took over the running of the prison - including extra officers and bolstered security - and we'll continue to drive improvements further to help more offenders turn their back on crime and improve staff safety.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The executive director of Norwich City FC has told fans that the planned expansion of the City Stand is too expensive at the moment.\nZoe Webber's comments came during a meeting of fans at the Forum in Norwich on Monday.\nShe confirmed that safe standing at Carrow Road would be in place for the England women's game on Friday.\nShe also hinted that players may have to be sold to realise the club's ambitions.\nThe fans' forum was the first opportunity to question the Canaries' new head coach, Johannes Hoff Thorup.\nHe shared the platform with Ms Webber and the club's sporting director Ben Knapper.\nWhen asked about the progress on plans to expand the City Stand, she said: \"If someone could do something about the price of steel, that would be hugely helpful.\n\"We have master plans of development for the whole stadium but, in terms of expanding the City Stand, it's just too cost-prohibitive at the moment, just because of the cost of materials, the cost of construction.\n\"But it's something that we constantly keep an eye on.\"\nShe added that the directors were looking at ways of making the plans for the stand more cost-effective and at ways of changing the current structure.\nMs Webber told fans that the club's ambitions were constantly being reviewed.\nShe said: \"We identify what those priorities are, what comes first and it might be 'right, we can do this, but, if you want to do this, we're going to have to sell one'.\"\nOn the positive side, she said safe standing at the ground would be \"ready for the game on Friday and it looks really good\".\nWhen asked about the involvement of Mark Attanasio, who became a majority shareholder in April, Ms Webber said: \"I think we're in a solid position. \n\"I think Mark coming in has enabled us to keep any debt within our ownership structure which puts us in a much stronger position than if you're  being financed by a third party.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The Roman Baths have lost more than \u00a390,000 in donations since telling visitors not to throw coins in a 2,000-year-old cold plunge pool and to donate through contactless payments instead. \nThe Circular Bath inside the Roman Baths is a small round cold plunge pool which visitors used to treat like a wishing well.\nConservationists at the attraction in the centre of Bath made the decision in March 2022 to shut the unofficial wishing well and ask people to donate using a card.\nKevin Guy, leader of Bath and North East Somerset Council said hundreds of thousands of coins were \"damaging and corroding\" the special site. \nMr Guy said at most the cold plunge pool would bring in more than \u00a3100,000 but that has now dropped significantly. \nWhile contactless donations have risen to \u00a32,504 in 2022/23 and \u00a32,335 in 2023/24, total donations have dropped tenfold.\nThe charity has collected a total of \u00a310,812 and \u00a39,490 in donations during those years.\nMr Guy said: \"It was originally designed as a cold water immersion plunge poll so historically not a wishing well.\n\"It's slightly older than the Trevi fountain in Rome and it's been there for 2,000 years and the primary concern of the council is to make sure it is still there in another 2,000 years time for future tourists to enjoy.\"\nMr Guy added the Roman Baths are still a success story with more than 1.1 million people visiting last year which made profits of \u00a311m.\n\"That allows us at BANES to have one of the lowest council taxes in the south west but also it allows us to spend that \u00a311m on the most vulnerable in society,\" he said. \nThe money donated through the pool is given to the Roman Baths Foundation - a charity set up in 2015 that supports education, research and conservation programmes.\nMr Guy added they were looking at ways to increase donations to the foundation through other means. \n\"Obviously we want to raise as much money as possible for the foundation, that is really important to us.\n\"We are looking alternatives to do that...but the most important thing is protecting the Baths for future generations and with the damage that was happening, we can't let that continue.\"\nHe added teams would have to regularly drain the Circular Bath to collect the coins which often themselves would then need cleaning. \nBath and North East Somerset Council added: \"Managing water-damaged coins and the decline in cash usage post-pandemic further supported our decision to look at other ways to encourage support.\n\u201cWe have introduced new contactless donation points and will be launching a new legacy scheme in the autumn.\u201d\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Archaeology students say they have uncovered the remains of a Roman villa in the Leicestershire countryside that likely dates back to the 2nd Century.\nThe University of Leicester team unearthed the building, which is thought to be about 230ft (70m) long.\nThe university said the find would \"provide valuable new insight into Roman country houses in rural Britain\".\nIt comes three years after archaeologists from the university discovered a Roman villa beneath a farmer's field in Rutland, which featured a Trojan War mosaic.\nThe two-week dig took place in May, and was run as a field school for first-year students, with most experiencing their first taste of an archaeological dig.\nThey were supervised by experienced archaeologists from University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS).\nThe university said a number of Roman finds had been discovered at the site over the years, with recently identified cropmarks revealing prehistoric settlement ditches and the Roman villa.\nFinds from the villa included fragments of brightly painted wall plaster and mosaic tiles.\nThis indicated the inhabitants decorated their rooms following the latest Roman fashions, the university said.\nDr Philippa Walton, lecturer in Roman Archaeology at the university, said the students had come away from the experience with \"lots of new skills and really importantly, helped to increase our understanding of how people lived in Roman Leicestershire\".\nEverything was filmed for a Time Team feature, focused on the students' experience of their first dig.\nDr John Gater, from Time Team, said: \u201cThe magnetic survey revealed a complex landscape of features including ring ditches and field systems, while the ground penetrating radar (GPR) mapped the footprint of the building itself.\n\"Although most of the floor surfaces had been robbed out, it was amazing to see the large granite stone blocks which formed some of the wall foundations.\u201d\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Walking into a climbing gym, Team GB's Molly Thompson-Smith says: \"I'm often the only one who looks the way I do.\"\nThe 26-year-old has been selected for the Paris Olympics but it's not just medals she's aiming for - it's change too. \nA 2021 study found that just 7% of people who take part in climbing are from non-white backgrounds, something Molly says she finds \"shocking\". \n\"One of my main motivations for competing at the Olympic Games is to be that role model, that athlete I wish I had when I was a kid,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.\nMolly will be joined in Team GB's climbing squad by fellow first-timers Erin McNeice, Toby Roberts and Hamish McArthur.\nClimbing made its debut as an Olympic sport at the last Games in Tokyo which Molly narrowly missed out on qualifying for.\nAt the gym she trains at in Sheffield, Molly says making it to the Games has always been her dream. \n\"It's something I've been wishing for ever since I was a little girl,\" she says.\nIt was Molly's seventh birthday party where she first discovered her love for climbing.\n\"I was lucky enough to grow up in a very sporty household in London and my brother and I would choose a different sport for every birthday party to try,\" she says.\n\"I remember that party so well. I remember not really caring about how my friends were getting on and just having the best time, being that kid that was like, 'Me, me, me! I want to go next!'\n\"Pretty much from then on, I've never stopped climbing - I was hooked.\"\nIn a sport that tests strength and endurance, Molly, who is mixed race, soon found she wasn't only being tested on the wall.\n\"I've definitely experienced racism and microaggressions within climbing,\" she says.\n\"I think it's important to be honest about my experiences because some people simply don't believe it.\"\nAt a World Cup event last summer, Molly says one of her teammates, who is also mixed race, was introduced under her name.\n\"For her to get to that point and then be introduced as the only other person of colour on the circuit because the commentator was too lazy... There's just no excuse, in my opinion. \n\"It was such a shame for her hard work to be undermined like that.\"\nShe also says she's experienced \"overt racism\" when competing abroad which she says has soured her success. \nIn 2021, Leeds Beckett University published a study which suggested people who take part in climbing overwhelmingly come from white backgrounds. \nIt found people from black, Asian and minority backgrounds only make up about 7% of participants in the sport. \n\"I'm always pretty shocked when I hear the stats about participation within climbing,\" says Molly.\nBut it doesn't come as a surprise to Rotimi Odukoya. \nIn 2019, he founded Climbxr in London with the mission of increasing diversity within climbing.\n\"When we initially started climbing, we went to a few climbing walls around London and some almost felt like they policed us,\" he says.\n\"Because they hadn't seen a group like us before. We were very unique in the climbing scene.\n\"You definitely do notice that we're pretty much the only black or underrepresented people in the room.\"\nRotimi thinks the cost of climbing could be holding some people from underrepresented communities back, so the group does what it can to offer reduced rates and discounted equipment.\nBut he says the main barrier to getting more people from minority backgrounds into climbing is the lack of representation.\n\"I definitely didn't see anyone who looked like me climbing on a wall,\" he says, adding that the sport rarely seems marketed towards black communities.\nSo for Molly to be representing the sport at the Olympics is \"huge\".\n\"It's going to have ripple effects of people that look like her wanting to pick up the sport because they identify with her,\" he says.\nIn Paris, there will be three climbing disciplines across two medal events - speed and combined (bouldering and lead).\nBouldering involves scaling a 15ft (4.5m) wall without ropes and in the speed race, athletes go head to head racing up a 49ft (15m) wall in the shortest time possible.\nBut it's the lead event, where athletes climb a 15m-wall without having seen the route ahead of time, that Molly says is her speciality. \nQualifying for the Games has been \"a long time coming\", she says, and she's been training hard for this moment after a serious foot injury 18 months ago knocked her back.\nNow she's made it, she's more determined to be a force for positive change when it comes to diversity in the sport. \n\"Going to Paris means so much more than just my own personal performance,\" Molly says. \n\"I really hope that I'm the athlete that a little girl or a little boy needs to see and can connect to.\"\nIn a statement, the BMC, which covers GB Climbing has told Newsbeat that it is \"committed to inclusivity\".\n\"We believe in the power of sport and activity to create social change, unite people and bring them together, to live healthier, happier, and more fulfilled lives.\"\nThey added there was \"a long way to go\".\n\"In ac",

    "Jurors in the retrial of Lucy Letby have been reminded by a judge they \"must not approach the case with any preconceived views\".\nThe 34-year-old is accused of the attempted murder of a premature child, referred to as Baby K, while working at Countess of Chester Hospital on 17 February 2016.\nProsecutors allege Letby deliberately dislodged the infant's breathing tube, but the former nurse said she did nothing to harm him.\nSumming up the case, Mr Justice Goss told jurors at Manchester Crown Court they must judge the case in a \"fair, calm, objective and analytical way\".\nThe jury was previously told Letby was convicted last August of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of six others at the hospital between June 2015 and June 2016.\nBut a verdict on the allegation concerning Baby K could not be reached and a retrial was ordered on that single count.\nThe prosecution claim Letby tampered with the infant's breathing tube and and was \"caught virtually red-handed\" by consultant paediatrician Dr Ravi Jayaram, when he walked into the neo-natal unit's intensive care nursery room.\nFrom the witness box, Letby told the court she did not recall being in the nursery at any time during the shift and has maintained her innocence.\nMr Justice Goss said: \"You decide the case on, and only on, all the evidence placed before you. There will be no more and you must not speculate about what other evidence there might have been.\n\"As I said at the very beginning of the trial, you must not approach the case with any preconceived views and you must cast out of your decision-making process any response or approach to the case based on emotion or any feelings of sympathy or antipathy you may have.\"\nThe judge continued: \"You must cast out of your decision-making process any response or approach to the case based on emotion or any feelings of sympathy or antipathy you may have.\n\"It is instinctive for anyone to react with horror to any allegation of deliberately harming a child, the more so a vulnerable, very premature baby.\"\nHe told jurors they would \"naturally feel sympathy\" for Baby K's parents, but must use \"common sense an collective good judgement\" as they assess the evidence.\nThe judge, giving legal directions to the jury, said Letby's convictions for murder and attempted murder \"does not prove that she has committed this offence on this occasion\".\nHe added: \"Her previous convictions may only be used as some support for the prosecution case if, having assessed the evidence, you are satisfied that it is right so to do.\"\nBaby K was transferred to a specialist hospital later on 17 February because of her extreme prematurity.\nShe died there three days later, although the prosecution does not allege Letby caused her death.\nLetby became tearful in the dock as her barrister Ben Myers gave his own summing up.\nHe urged the jury not to use the defendant's previous convictions to \"beef up a fundamentally weak case\".\nHe said: \"Miss Clancy [junior counsel] and I are here to defend Lucy Letby and that is what we will do. \n\"Standing up for her when no-one else is going to do that.\n\"For this to be a fair trial and for there to be a fair outcome on the evidence, that comes comes down to you ladies and gentlemen. \n\"It is you who decides.

    "Donald Trump\u2019s former top adviser Steve Bannon has told the BBC he does not fear going to prison or watching the former president\u2019s 2024 campaign from behind bars.\nAfter being convicted of contempt of Congress, the man who was seen as the power behind the scenes in the White House at the start of Trump\u2019s presidential term in 2017 reported to a federal prison in Connecticut just before noon on Monday.\nHe is still appealing against his conviction for refusing to appear in front of the committee of lawmakers investigating the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters. Bannon has claimed that conversations he had with the president that day should be protected under executive privilege.\nBut last week the Supreme Court ruled he could not delay his sentence until after the appeal was heard, and now Bannon will have to face his four-month sentence.\n\"I'm proud of going to prison today,\" Bannon said outside the low-security prison just before turning himself in. \"I have not only no regrets, I'm proud of what I did.\"\nAsked what he expects from the next several months, Bannon responded, \"a Trump victory\".\nIn an interview with the BBC, he said he was unconcerned about missing a crucial part of Trump\u2019s campaign, as there is a \u201cMaga army\u201d ready to ensure the former president defeats Joe Biden and returns to the White House.\n\u201cI've served my country now for the last 10 or so years focusing on this,\u201d he said, referring to politics and Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) slogan. \u201cIf I have to do it in a prison, I do it in a prison - it makes no difference at all.\u201d\n\nA former Goldman Sachs banker turned alt-right media figure, Bannon was seen by Democrats as the brain behind not only Trump's extraordinary political rise but also some of his most divisive policies.\nHe shot to national prominence as chief executive of Donald Trump\u2019s successful 2016 presidential campaign and then became one of the most powerful figures in Washington as White House chief strategist early in the Trump administration.\nSeven months into his White House posting, however, he was fired and spent some time adrift from Trump\u2019s inner circle.\nThe challenging aspect of Bannon's persona is that \"most commentators alternate between calling him a mastermind and saying that he\u2019s irrelevant\", said Benjamin Teitelbaum, the author of War for Eternity: Inside Bannon's Far-Right Circle of Global Power Brokers.\n\"He\u2019s both extremes at once.\u201d\nIn the interim, Bannon appears to have worked his way back into the Trump fold, and for the last five years has hosted the War Room - where he has continued to back the former president and his movement.\nBannon\u2019s actual \u201cwar room\u201d is in the basement of an elegant Capitol Hill town house, just a stone\u2019s throw from the US Supreme Court.\nEvery surface is piled high with hardback books on politics, finance and conspiracy theories. Stacked on the mantlepiece, among assorted religious iconography, is a printed quote that Bannon - who sees himself as a shepherd of the Maga populist agenda - coined: \u201cThere are NO conspiracies but there are NO coincidences.\u201d\nThe huge handbook of \"Project 2025\" is positioned in a place of pride in the room. The 900-page tome put together by the Heritage Foundation - a conservative think tank - contains detailed plans for how a second Trump administration will transform the American government and the power of the executive branch.\nWe were surrounded by the lights, cameras and microphones that Bannon uses to broadcast for four hours every weekday when he told me he and his show have played a major part in empowering and mobilising thousands of Trump-supporting activists, who he called \u201cstreet fighters\u201d.\nThough he will not be able to lead them from prison, he said that this \u201cMaga army\u201d that \u201ccan\u2019t and won\u2019t stop until final victory\u201d will easily continue on its mission.\nAfter all, he said, the populist Maga movement is greater than him - and even Donald Trump. According to Bannon, it does not matter who delivers its message.\nBannon continues to make the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump - in reality, courts have thrown out dozens of lawsuits challenging the results and no evidence of widespread fraud has emerged.\nOn election day, 5 November, Bannon said the \u201cMaga army\u201d would be ready to deploy across the country, at polling stations and election counts to ensure the former president\u2019s victory. \nThese supporters - including poll watchers and lawyers - would challenge ballots they don\u2019t believe should be awarded to Joe Biden, he said.\nMr Teitelbaum, however, doubted that Bannon's own audience was \"organised enough to be deployable in the way he describes\". \nConfident that Trump will win in November, Bannon was eager to discuss what the former president\u2019s agenda would be once he returns to government \u2013 and the War Room host leaves prison.\nHe believes the next Trump White House will be influenced by ideas he has promoted on his show.\nImmigration remains a top priority, B",
    "Farm incomes in Northern Ireland almost halved in 2023, new figures from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) show.\nThe provisional estimates indicate that total income from farming (TIFF) fell from \u00a3609m in 2022 to \u00a3341m in 2023 - a reduction of 44%.\nTIFF is the return on own labour, management input and own capital invested.\nFarmers bought less fertiliser and lime in 2023, but spent more on feedstuffs, which accounted for more than half the total value of gross snputs.\nAcross all farm types, farm business income is expected to decrease by 46% a farm from an average \u00a351,043 in 2022-23 to \u00a327,345 in 2023-24.\nThe reductions are expected mainly in cereal (-80%) and dairy farming (-70%).\nBut increased pig prices mean incomes from pig farms are expected to rise by 84% in 2023-24.\nHigher beef prices also mean incomes from cattle and sheep in less favoured areas - a classification of land that is not as productive - and cattle and sheep in lowland farms are expected to increase by 8% and 3% respectively.\nThe agriculture and environment minister said fluctuating market conditions were not a new problem, but remained a \"very difficult\" issue for farmers.\nAndrew Muir added that fluctuations were mainly due to price influences in world markets which are outside Daera's control. \n\"Consequently, my department focuses effort on helping farmers mitigate cost and price pressures by improving their productivity and resilience, while also addressing their environmental sustainability levels,\" he said.\n\"These are the goals of our new farm support and development programme.\"\nMr Muir also said the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise in Antrim continued to offer \"relevant training and support to farmers\".\nTotal gross output for agriculture fell to \u00a32.87bn in 2023, almost a third of which was comprised of dairying (\u00a3892m).\nThe amount of milk produced and the price per litre it attracted also fell.\nIntensive sectors - poultry, eggs and pig production - all saw increases in the value of their output, although production fell in the pig and egg sectors.",

And family and friends. \n\"And to be honest, I'm still kind of breath-taken by the response from people across the country, across the world . It's just extraordinary. \n\"He was quite a sort of quiet, humble man, and to have that sort of response is just extraordinary.\"\nDr Mosley went missing last month after leaving a beach to go for a walk in Symi, where he was on holiday. \nFollowing a high-profile search, rescue crews found the BBC Just One Thing podcast presenter's body four days later in a rocky area. \nSpeaking on what Dr Mosley would have made of the outpouring of affection, his widow said: \"He didn't seek the limelight. He was quite shy, but loved what he did and was very good at it.\" \nShe said she has a list of \"caring\" and \"touching\" tributes from people, adding the family has only just started looking at some letters as they were sent so many. \nIn a statement posted on Instagram on Thursday, Dr Bailey Mosley described it as \"very hard\" trying to piece her family's lives back together. \n\"Grief can feel overwhelming. Light and beautiful. Catch you by surprise. Feel like the weight of a stone or a sharp pain. It changes unexpectedly,\" she said.\n\"As people often say, it\u2019s a journey, not all sad and you take each day at a time.\"\nBut she hopes she can continue to share the message of her husband, who she said is present through the lives that he touched. \nFriday's Just One Thing Day is named after his podcast where he revealed tips to help improve your health. \nIt is focused on encouraging healthy habits by introducing easy routines or simple swaps into daily life to improve wellbeing.\nThe Today programme on Friday heard from people whose lives have been changed by Mosley's tips, with TV shows Morning Live and The One Show, on which Dr Mosley was a regular contributor, also featuring Just One Thing Day.\nOn Morning Live, presenters stood on one leg, a popular Dr Mosley tip. Standing on one leg for 30 seconds and then switching leg has been shown to help improve balance and posture, Dr Punam Krishan told viewers. \nOne of those who gave tribute was former deputy Labour leader Lord Watson.\nHe said Dr Mosley's book on ultra-low calorie diets helped him keep his type 2 diabetes in remission.\n\"There are millions of people in this country, like me, that will remember Michael every day when they do silly little things like standing on their left leg... he brought joy to our lives and he gave us good health,\" he said. \n\"A day dedicated to the impact he had on people\u2019s lives and to celebrate his legacy within broadcasting and beyond \u2013 it\u2019s humbling and delightful all at once.  We are so grateful,\" Dr Bailey Mosley added.\n\n",
    "Accessible toilets that \"provide dignity\" for disabled residents and their carers on the Isle of Man should not be a \"luxury\", an MHK has said.\nThe Noble's Hospital Charitable Trusts have agreed to fund a \u00a345,000 Changing Place at the hospital, Manx Care has confirmed.\nHowever Infrastructure Minister Tim Crookall told the House of Keys his department did not have the required \u00a3100,000 for a facility at the Sea Terminal. \nWelcoming the progress at the hospital, Sarah Maltby MHK said funding issues stalling the construction of a room at a \"gateway to the island\" were \"frustrating\".\nMr Crookall told politicians a business case had been prepared for a space at the Douglas ferry terminal, which was being assessed by the department.\nHe said a review had found no room was large enough to accommodate a facility with a ceiling hoist, and said proposals that identified the \"most suitable location\" would mean the relocation of first aid and security team rooms.\nWhen challenged by Ms Maltby on funding for the scheme, the minister greed the facilities should be available but said \"we haven't got that money, and we'd have to find it\".\nMs Maltby said money being a \"crunch point\" sent the message that the government did not \"believe fully accessible facilities that gives people with a disability dignity, and saves their carers from injury, is not considered value for money\".\nBut confirmation after the sitting that a facility with a larger toilet, adult-sized changing benches and a hoist would be installed at the island's main hospital was \"absolutely brilliant progress\" and would make a \"significant difference\", she said.\nIt should be a \"basic standard\" to have such a facility for people who \"will probably attend more medical appointments than other people without a disability\", she added.\nThere are currently two facilities available on the island, at the Manx Museum and the newly rebranded Tesco store on Victoria Road in Douglas.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

    "Boeing is one of the largest and most important companies in the United States. Arguably, it is too big to fail. But is it also too big to be held to account?\nThe company is one of the world\u2019s two main manufacturers of large commercial jets. It ranks among the top five US defence contractors.\nIt employs more than 170,000 people globally, including 150,000 in the US, and generated revenues of nearly $78bn (\u00a360bn) last year. It makes a vital contribution to the US economy.\nBut its commitment to safety has repeatedly been called into question, most recently following an incident earlier this year in which a disused door fell off a Boeing 737 Max minutes after takeoff.\nWhistleblowers have since made a series of claims about alleged unsafe practices in Boeing\u2019s factories, as well as in those of its main supplier, Spirit Aerosystems.\nCritics say the company has not taken its problems seriously - and that regulators, cowed by the firm's importance, are not taking the steps necessary to force Boeing to fix its problems. \nA new deal for the firm has amplified those claims. \nThis week, the firm agreed to plead guilty to an existing criminal fraud charge,  which was brought after two near-identical crashes involving Boeing's brand new 737 Max, that occurred more than five years ago, killing 346 people.\nFamily members of many of those killed have said the agreement, which will be submitted to a judge for approval, is far too lenient.\n\"The plea deal with Boeing unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive and fails to hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of 346 persons,\" their lawyer Paul Cassell wrote in a written objection to the deal.\nThe deal stems from an investigation that started in 2019, after the second crash.\nInvestigators later concluded that Boeing had cut corners during the design of its 737 Max, and deceived regulators.\nBoeing was accused of putting profits ahead of passenger safety. \nIn 2021, Boeing agreed to pay a $2.5bn settlement, but avoided prosecution on a criminal fraud conspiracy charge.\nBut in May the Department of Justice (DoJ) found Boeing broke the terms of that settlement by not implementing and enforcing a suitable compliance and ethics programme.\nAs part of its guilty plea, Boeing agreed to pay a $243.6m penalty and submit to independent monitoring for three years. \nIt also agreed that its board of directors would meet with victims' families and pledged to invest some $455m in safety improvements. \nErin Applebaum, a lawyer who represents 34 families who lost loved ones on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, said the deal was \"nothing more than a slap on the wrist and will do nothing to effectuate meaningful change within the company\". \nThe DoJ said the agreement did not preclude action against any individual executives or against the company for conduct that occurred after the 2018 and 2019 crashes. \nBut officials left some key questions - such as how the guilty plea would affect Boeing's ability to bid for government work - unanswered.\nIn Washington, the agreement was greeted by some calls from lawmakers for further action.\nSenator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who has led hearings focused on Boeing's retaliation against whistleblowers said, individuals, not just the company, should face consequences \"for past illegalities as well as continuing retaliation against whistleblowers & other wrongdoing\".\n\"This plea deal cannot be the end of Boeing\u2019s accountability,\"  he wrote on social media. \"The need for ongoing aggressive investigative efforts and other action is obvious.\"\n\"Regardless of the DOJ\u2019s efforts, Congress must not let up on its own oversight of both Boeing and the FAA, and that is something I plan to continue to pursue,\u201d Senator Tammy Duckworth added.\nBefore the deal was announced, others had expressed concerns that Boeing was too important to be held fully accountable.\n\"I\u2019ll go back to the reality of the fact that we all want Boeing to succeed,\u201d Republican Senator Ron Johnson said at a hearing in April.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to think that there are conditions in these planes that should really force regulators to ground these planes - what that would do to our economy, what that would do to people\u2019s lives.\"\nAnalysts said there was little doubt Boeing\u2019s status as a major contractor to the US military would have been a key factor in deciding what action to take against the company.\nIn 2022 alone, it racked up more than $14bn worth of contracts with the Department of Defense.\n\"That may matter the most regarding not the direct terms of the plea, but rather the negotiations over possible debarment or suspension from contracting,\" said Prof Brandon Garrett of Duke University School of Law, who tracks corporate prosecutions.\nThere is also Boeing\u2019s position in the commercial aviation market to consider. \nThe crises have already taken a heavy toll on the company, which has lost money every year since 2019, a sum totalling more than $30bn.\nBut the market cu",
    "Learner drivers that fail their test multiple times should have to pay more to retake it, the RAC Foundation has said.\nThe move would force people to save up and wait until they're ready, easing the \"unacceptable\" test backlog, claimed the motoring charity. \nIt said the current pass rate of 48% was too low and needed to be raised to reduce the backlog built up over the Covid-19 pandemic. \nHowever, driving instructor Ashley Raymont said increasing fees was equal to \"punishment\". \n\"For some it can already cost thousands and to increase the test fee is just punishment,\" said Ms Raymont, 30, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan. \n\"Neurodiverse learners are putting themselves out there and often fail due a silly mistake they\u2019ve not made before in the company of a stranger judging their driving.\"\nMs Raymont agreed the backlog desperately needed to be tackled, but said more funding to train examiners would be the solution.\n\"In Cardiff there are eight examiners where as in Barry there are only two, you\u2019re looking at a hundred tests a day compared to a handful.\n\"People don\u2019t stay in areas local to them as they can\u2019t get tested.\"\nEmilia Copp, 23, who passed on her fourth attempt, said even well-prepared learners could fail their test.\n\"Any other exam I don\u2019t feel nervous, but the driving test I struggled,\" said the Cardiff University student. \n\"I ended up failing with just two minors on my first test and my nerves just got worse each time.\"\nShe said even without the suggested price increases, she spent about \u00a31,500 on lessons and tests before she passed in 2018. \nIn 2024, practical driving tests cost \u00a362 during weekday daytimes and \u00a375 during evenings, weekends and bank holidays.\nSteve Gooding, RAC Foundation boss, said: \"Of the nearly 2 million practical car driving tests conducted last year fewer than half resulted in the candidate being awarded a full licence.\n\"It must be in everyone\u2019s interests to improve this pass rate so people can access the opportunities driving brings, not least when it comes to employment. \n\"But also, more first-time passes means fewer people queueing to take another test, clogging up a system already struggling to cope with demand.\u201d\nThe Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) said it was unable to comment while the new government was being appointed.",
    "Every day, for the last seven years, Arun Kumar has set up his fruit stall on a busy Mumbai street.\nIt's not an easy way to make a living.\n\u201cBeing a street vendor is a challenge. There's the fear of being robbed or, as I am not a licensed vendor, the local body can come and dismantle my store anytime,\" he says.\nBut over the past four years at least one aspect of his work has become easier. \n\u201cPrior to Covid everything was in cash. But now everyone pays with UPI. Scan the code and the payment is done within seconds.\n\"No issues of handling cash, giving change to customers. It has made my life and business smooth,\u201d he says.\nUPI, or to give it its full name the Unified Payments Interface, was launched in 2016  in a collaboration between India's central bank and the nation's banking industry.\nIt's an app-based instant payment system, which allows users to send and receive money, pay bills and authorise payments in a single step - no need to enter bank details or any other personal information. And, perhaps most importantly, it's free.\nIt has become so popular that India is now the biggest real-time payments market.\nIn May, UPI recorded 14 billion transactions, up from nine billion the year before. \nBut the popularity and ease of use has made it a rich feeding ground for scammers.\n\u201cWhile digital payments are convenient, they do come with vulnerabilities,\" says Shashank Shekhar, founder of the Delhi-based Future Crime Research Foundation.\nMr Shekhar says that scammers use a variety of ways to trick people, including persuading them to share their UPI pin number, which is needed to authorise payments.\nSome scammers have also created fake UPI apps, that are clones of legitimate banking apps, and then steal login details or other valuable information.\n\"The pace at which digital transformation took place in the country means unfortunately digital literacy and safe internet practice could not catch up,\" says Mr Shekhar.\nHe says that between January 2020 and June 2023 almost half of all financial fraud involved the use of the UPI system.\nAccording to government figures there were more than 95,000 cases of fraud involving UPI in the financial year ending April 2023, up from 77,000 in the previous year.\nShivkali was one such victim. She had always wanted to own a scooter, but they were beyond her budget.\nHowever, earlier in the year the 22-year-old, who lives in Bihar state in northeastern India, spotted one for sale on Facebook that looked like a great deal.\n\"I grabbed the opportunity without thinking,\" she says. \nA couple of clicks later and she was talking to the owner, who said that for $23 he would send over the vehicle papers.\nThat went smoothly, so Shivkali continued to send the owner money, via instant transfers. She eventually ended up paying $200, but the scooter (also commonly called a Scooty in India), was never delivered.\nShivkali realised she had been scammed.\n\"I did not think I could be cheated, as I have some education background and know what is happing in the world. But scammers are smart. They have an art of speaking to convince the opposite person,\u201d she says.\nThe government and the central bank are looking at ways to protect UPI users from scammers.\nBut at the moment, if a victim wants compensation, they have to approach their bank.\n\u201cThe problem is deep rooted,\" says Dr Durgesh Pandey, an expert in financial crime.\n\"Most of the onus lies with banks and telecom companies. They are lax in making identity checks, that\u2019s why the fraudster can\u2019t be traced.\n\"But the challenge for banks particularly is that they have to balance between inclusivity, ease of business and enforcement of identity checks. If they are too rigid, the vulnerable section of society will remain without banking facilities.\u201d\nBut Dr Pandey argues that in most cases of fraud, the bank is not totally to blame.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex question because the problem lies with banks, but it\u2019s the victim who is giving his credentials in most case. I would say both victim and bank should bear the loss.\u201d\nDespite those problems, UPI is being promoted in rural areas where access to banking services can be difficult.\nPoonam Untwal from Rajasthan runs a guidance centre which helps people use the internet and digital banking.\n\"Most of us are not that educated, nor know the proper use of smartphones. I teach them that phones are no longer a device just to talk to people but banks at their fingertips,\" she says.\nShe believes that UPI will help develop the local economy.\n\"Many women like me have a small business that we run from our home. Now we can receive and send money with UPI. People who don\u2019t have smart phones come to my centre to get their transactions done,\" she says.\nAs well as making inroads into rural areas, UPI is spreading overseas.\nRetailers in Bhutan, Mauritius, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka and UAE will take UPI payments. \nAnd this year, France become the first European country to accept UPI payments, starting with tickets to the Eiffel Tower.\nBack in ",
    "A Russian human rights activist has compared the country's judicial system to that of Nazi Germany.\nOleg Orlov, who was appealing against a prison sentence for discrediting the armed forces, quoted a US prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials as saying the Nazis totally destroyed justice and law during their rule.\nOrlov, 71, who chairs the now banned human rights group Memorial, lost his appeal.\nHe was jailed five months ago for two-and-a-half years after calling Russia a fascist state and criticising the war against Ukraine.\nThe sentence was seen as a clear sign that Russia was increasingly cracking down on public dissent.\nSpeaking by video link from custody in the central city of Syzran, Orlov told the Moscow city court in his final statement that he regretted nothing and would not repent.\n\"I'm in the necessary place at the necessary time,\" he said. \"When there are mass repressions in the country, I am with those who are being persecuted.\"\nHe also quoted a passage by Telford Taylor, a US prosecutor involved in the convictions of senior members of the Nazi regime after World War Two, who said: \"They distorted, perverted and in the end achieved the total destruction of justice and law. They made the judicial system an integral part of the dictatorship.\"\n\"These words can be uttered now by any Russian political prisoner,\" he added. \n\"These words are surprisingly appropriate to characterise the current state of the Russian judicial system.\"\n\nThe appeal was attended by ambassadors from the US, UK and several other Western nations.\nOrlov's conviction resulted partly from an article written for French media titled \"They wanted fascism. They got it\", about Russia's apparent descent into dictatorship.\nHis sentencing in February itself followed a retrial. In the original trial in October last year he received a 150,000 rouble fine (\u00a31,290; $1,630) and walked free from the court.\nHowever, prosecutors complained that the sentence was too lenient and a higher court cancelled the ruling.\nOrlov has been an important figure in Memorial, which has for decades sought to preserve the memory of victims of Soviet oppression while also campaigning against human rights abuses in modern Russia.\nIn 2021 it was banned and dissolved in Russia but the following year received the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the Belarusian activist Ales Bialiatski and the Ukrainian Center for Civil Liberties for demonstrating \"the significance of civil society for peace and democracy\".",

They're incredibly strong and the force of their jaws have the ability to cause serious damage,\" he said.\nThe total number of dog attacks investigated in Northern Ireland's 11 councils for April 2023 to March 2024 is 1,581, according to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera).\nXL bully dogs are behind 48 of these attacks, with 30 of these resulting in injuries to persons or other animals, Daera said.",

The BBC has contacted Guernsey Ports, which operates the airport, for comment.\nMr Wall said he had to be flown on Aurigny's now retired jet after he boarded the airline's ATR but then discovered his wheelchair was too big to go down the aisle.\nHe said the difficulties he had experienced \"wouldn't put [him] off\" flying, but Guernsey needed an airline that \"knew what it was doing\".\nMr Wall said: \"As taxpayers, we've been subsidising this airline for donkey's years.\n\"They all talk about specialised routes and lifetime routes, but in the normal aviation world they wouldn't last five minutes.\n\"I hope they have sorted it, but I doubt it.\"\nMrs Le Prevost said she always told staff at the airport she was an amputee, even though they could see it, as she knew the metal in her knee replacement and artificial limb would set alarms off.\nShe said she was treated differently to other travellers, being taken into \"a different room\", having her artificial limb swabbed down, and being asked to remove her shoes.\nMrs Le Prevost said: \"I often have to ask for a chair because I'm not very good at walking without shoes on - the artificial limb is set to have a pair of shoes on.\"\nShe said staff were generally understanding but it was embarrassing \"in this day and age\".\nMrs Le Prevost said she used to travel regularly to disabled sports events as chair of a local disability sports group.\nShe said the group \"didn't really have a lot of problems\" travelling with the island's  ferry company, Condor, whereas some people became \"quite anxious\" when flying.\nMrs Le Prevost said some staff were \"absolutely marvellous\" but \"others just can't understand what's happening - it's like swings and roundabouts\".\nShe said: \"In this day and age some people are more aware about disabilities and things are for the better for all people - so things are improving.\"\nPeter Leigh, who runs an adapted taxi service, said his clients have had bad experiences travelling to and from Guernsey because of unsuitable equipment to help them board.\nHe said life was \"very difficult\" for disabled people who travelled alone.\nMr Leigh said: \"It should be easy. Life shouldn't stop just because you're in a wheelchair.\n\"The support in Guernsey should be unrivalled because it's a single airline.\"\nGuernsey introduced new legislation in 2023, which outlaws various forms of discrimination including ableism - discrimination against disabled people.\nBusinesses are required to make \"reasonable adjustments\" so that disabled people have access to their goods and services.\nHowever, the law gives businesses until 2028 to make changes to physical features.\nIn a statement, Aurigny said it had recently ordered two height-adjustable remote boarding ramps to \"better support customers\".\nIt said it had also invested in ramps at Southampton Airport and Gatwick Airport. \nA spokesperson said: \u201cStaff have been trained to assist customers with mobility issues and hidden disabilities and continue to improve their knowledge and skills further.\"\nThey added in May, the airline had helped 427 customers with reduced mobility to board and disembark. \n\"The airline remains dedicated to offering this support to all customers who request it in advance.\n\u201cCustomers needing special assistance on an Aurigny flight should contact our reservations team a minimum of 72 hours before travel.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "Passengers on a ride at Wales' largest theme park were injured after it came to a sudden halt.\nBounce, the \"drop tower\" attraction at Oakwood in Pembrokeshire, \"experienced a programmed emergency stop procedure\" whilst in mid-fall on Wednesday, a statement from park owners said.\nIt added a number of people reported \"minor lower back pain\" and had to be attended to by a team of in-house first aiders.\n The ride has now been closed pending an investigation.   \nThe statement from Oakwood Theme Park read: \"During operation today our drop tower ride Bounce experienced a programmed emergency stop procedure in response to the ride drop height.\n\"The stoppage of the passenger gondola was attended to by our park team and the ride was lowered to the ground where guests were able to disembark.  \n\"A number of guests reported minor lower back pain immediately after the occurrence and were attended to by our onsite team of first aiders, where assistance was provided. \n\"One group sought additional treatment locally, whilst others continued their day at the park.  \n\"We have closed Bounce whilst we consult with the ride manufacturer.\u201d\nBounce was initially shut in 2016 and was supposed to reopen in 2019 following a \u00a3400,000 refurbishment.\nHowever, the onset of the pandemic saw its reopening delayed until 2022.\nThe attraction is described on Oakwood's website as \"a gravity-defying, stomach-lurching shot \u2018n\u2019 drop tower ride\". \n\"Straight up, straight down - with lots of screams in between,\" it added.\nOakwood also hit the headlines in October 2022 when a man had to be hospitalised following an incident on its Treetops rollercoaster.  \nEyewitnesses reported seeing him fall out of a carriage to the ground, which led to the park temporarily closing. \nBut the Health and Safety Executive said its examiners found no fault with any of the ride's equipment and no action was taken against the park.\nAnd in April 2004, Hayley Williams, 16, from Pontypool, died after falling 100ft (30.48m) from Oakwood's Hydro Ride.\nHer family called for tighter safety regulations at theme parks as a result of her death.

    "Hungary's Viktor Orban has no peace plan of his own, but he has spent the past two weeks on a whistle-stop tour of Kyiv, Moscow, Azerbaijan, Beijing, Washington and even Mar-a-Lago, on a one-man mission that has infuriated leaders in the EU and US.\n\"Peace will not come by itself in the Russia-Ukraine war, someone has to make it,\" he proclaims in videos posted daily on his Facebook page.\nHe has been bitterly attacked by both Brussels and Washington for breaking EU and Nato unity and cosying up to Vladimir Putin and China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping.\nFew argue with his central premise, that there can be no peace without peacemakers. But his close economic relationship with Russia\u2019s president leaves him open to the charge of acting as Mr Putin\u2019s puppet.\nThe right-wing Hungarian PM says a ceasefire tied to a specific deadline would be a start.\n\"I am not negotiating on behalf of anyone,\" he told Hungarian radio during a brief stopover in Budapest between visits to Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and Mr Putin in Moscow.\nFor the next six months, Hungary holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.\nMr Orban followed up his first visit to Kyiv since the start of the war with the first trip by an EU leader to Russia since April 2022. That visit to the Kremlin clearly angered his European partners.\nCharles Michel, the head of the European Council of 27 EU governments, said the rotating presidency gave no mandate to engage with Russia on the EU\u2019s behalf.\nMr Orban admitted that was the case, but insisted: \"I\u2019m clarifying the facts\u2026 I\u2019m asking questions.\"\nIn Kyiv he posed \"three or four\" to President Zelensky \"so that we can understand his intentions, and where the red line is, the boundary up to which he can go in the interest of peace\".\nHe has also been generous in his praise of two other allies, Xi Jinping and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nMeeting Mr Erdogan on arrival at the Nato summit in Washington, he spoke of him as \"the only man who has overseen an agreement between Russia and Ukraine\" so far, referring to a now defunct Black Sea grain agreement.\n\"China not only loves peace but has also put forward a series of constructive and important initiatives [for resolving the war],\" he said of President Xi Jinping, according to Chinese state media.\nThe final visit on his whirlwind tour was to presidential candidate Donald Trump, another close ally who he strongly backs to win again in November and who he refers to as a man of peace.\nIn one interview, he declared that during Trump\u2019s four-year term as president \u201che did not initiate a single war\".\nThis has been a remarkable trip in the international limelight for the leader of a small East European country with 9.7 million inhabitants. But who is it designed to impress, and could it have any effect?\nA key target of his message is the domestic public.\nViktor Orban has had a relatively bad year so far, losing the two most prominent female politicians in his party to a scandal in February, and witnessing the emergence of his first serious challenger for more than a decade - Peter Magyar.\nIn June, Mr Orban\u2019s Fidesz party won an impressive 45% in European elections, to 30% for Mr Magyar\u2019s three-month-old Tisza party.\nBut he lost more than 700,000 votes (one in four) compared with the last parliamentary elections in 2022. \nFor the first time, he does not look invincible.\nWhat better way to show Hungarians that their leader was still strong than to parade across the world stage, in a global tour \"to make peace\"?\nHis mission was also targeted at an international public, in the week that his new Patriots for Europe (PfE) group in the European Parliament attracted 84 MEPs from mainly far-right parties in 11 countries.\nPatriots for Europe has emerged as the third largest faction in parliament, edging aside the rival Conservatives and Reformist group of Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni.\nMr Orban's visit to Moscow won him effusive praise from the Russians: \u201cWe take it very, very positively. We believe it can be very useful,\u201d said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\nThe US was less impressed.\n\u201cWe would welcome, of course, actual diplomacy with Russia to make it clear to Russia that they need to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, that they need to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity,\u201d said US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. \u201cBut that is not at all what this visit appears to have been.\u201d\nAt the same time, the US did welcome Mr Orban's first visit to neighbouring Ukraine since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion.\nThe Hungarian leader has given very little away about the actual content of his talks in Kyiv, Moscow or Beijing.\nA leaked version of his letter to Charles Michel, sent from Azerbaijan, offers some clues.\nMr Putin was open to a ceasefire, Mr Orban told the European Council president, provided it did not provide Ukraine with a chance to reorganise its army on the front lines.\nThree days earlier in Kyiv, on 2 July, the Ukrainian leader used a similar argument, telling Mr O",
    "A second young elephant has died from an often deadly virus at Dublin Zoo.\nIn a statement, the zoo said the elephant died due to Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesvirus (EEHV).\nThe virus - which attacks membranes, rapidly causing fever and bleeding - has a mortality rate of up to 85%.\nAlmost all Asian elephants carry the virus, but it only develops into an illness for some and there is no vaccination against it.\nIt does not pose a health risk to humans.\nIn a statement, the zoo said it was \"heartbroken to announce the passing of Zinda, our beloved seven-year-old elephant, on 7 July\".\nIt follows the recent death of another elephant, Avani, on 1 July, infected with the same virus.\nRelatively little is known about EEHV, which affects both wild and captive Asian elephants.\nThe virus often lies latent in elephants and can be triggered without warning, as it is carried asymptomatically.\nEEHV was discovered in 1990 and formally characterised in 1999 by researchers at the Smithsonian Zoo in Washington DC. \nThey linked 10 cases of a \"highly fatal haemorrhagic disease\" in young Asian and African elephants in zoos. \nIn each case, they found \"herpes virus-like particles\" in cells of dead elephants' hearts, livers and tongues.\nSince then, the virus has ripped through elephants populations in zoos. It has caused more than half of the deaths of Asian elephants in European and North American zoos over the last four decades.\nIt has now been detected in sanctuaries, safari parks and, more worryingly, in wild elephant herds in nine countries, including in India, Nepal and Myanmar.\nIn an \"unprecedented effort\" to save Zinda, Dublin Zoo said both the Irish and UK governments faciliated the urgent importation of blood products and other essential supplies from Chester Zoo.\n\"We fervently hoped this would have helped save Zinda\u2019s life. We are profoundly grateful to Chester Zoo for their unwavering support during this critical time,\" Dublin Zoo said.\nChester Zoo has lost numerous elephants to EEHV and, with scientists at the University of Surrey, is embarking on a world first - a trial of a potentially life-saving vaccine.\n\"Despite receiving round the clock care from our dedicated veterinary team and international experts, Zinda's condition deteriorated,\" Dublin Zoo said.\n\"EEHV is an unpredictable and fatal virus affecting young elephants both in the wild and under human care,\" it added.\nThe zoo also thanked An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish police force), who escorted the blood products from Dublin Port to the zoo.\nDublin Zoo has enacted its EEHV response plan and is consulting with leading international experts in elephant health, virology and wildlife management.\n\"Currently, the other elephants in our herd are not showing signs of EEHV, but we are closely monitoring their health,\" the zoo said.\n\"The quick progression of the virus in Zinda underscores the challenges of managing this disease, even with the highest standards of care and vigilance.\"\nThe zoo added its commitment to the wellbeing of its elephants \"remains steadfast\" and it will \"continue to take all necessary measures to ensure their safety\".",
    "British artificial intelligence (AI) chip firm Graphcore - once considered a potential rival to market leader Nvidia - has been bought by a Japanese conglomerate.\nSoftbank has not disclosed how much it paid - but it is thought to be considerably less than the \u00a32bn the UK company was valued at after a financing round in 2020.\nGraphcore head Nigel Toon told the BBC it was \"a tremendous endorsement of our team\". \nHowever, the deal is likely to raise questions about the UK's ability to develop firms which can take on the biggest players in the booming AI chip market.\nIt is not the first time Softbank has acquired a promising UK start-up - in 2016 it controversially acquired another British chip designer, Arm.\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said it was \"another bitter blow\" to UK financial markets to see Graphcore follow suit.\n\"It comes at a time when London is looking for a blockbuster tech listing to reinvigorate its reputation as a global financial centre,\" he said.\nThe Science Secretary Peter Kyle called the deal a \"welcome end to the uncertainty that has faced Graphcore and its employees\".\nBut he also admitted it was a \"reminder of the important work that needs to be done\" to make the UK \"the best place to start and grow a business.\u201d\nMr Toon said he believed the deal showed UK firms could compete with big tech, claiming Graphcore went \"toe to toe with the largest companies in this space with a much smaller team with much less capital\".\n\"It's really positive for the UK, bringing new investment here to help drive the growth agenda which as we all heard recently is so important.\"\nHe said he would stay on as head of the company, and the move would lead to Graphcore hiring new staff in its UK offices.\nThe firm will now be a subsidiary under SoftBank but will remain headquartered in Bristol.\nThough the sale price has not been made public, it has been reported that it is $500m (\u00a3390m).\nMr Toon said he would not \"go into any of the speculation\" around the sums of money involved.\nBut he did concede that the valuation of tech firms in general \"have been up and down\".\n\"We've certainly seen a lot of other companies, their values have dropped and investors have taken appropriate cautious decisions about how they value investments on their books. \n\"Hopefully, as a result of this deal, we'll see big investment and huge progress for Graphcore together with SoftBank.\"\nGraphcore was founded in 2016 by Mr Toon and Simon Knowles - its computer chips, the Colossus series, allow for powerful computer processing.\nHowever it has struggled with slowing sales since its bumper 2020 valuation, and announced in 2022 that it had closed offices in Norway, Japan and South Korea.\nThen in 2023, major tech investor Sequoia Capital said it had entirely written off the value of its stake in the company.\nThat was a major disappointment considering, at one point, Graphcore was seen as a potential competitor to Nvidia in the AI space.\nIts would-be rival has grown significantly in value and briefly this year held the title of the most valuable company in the world.\n\"I think this is actually good news for UK tech and Graphcore,\" said Dan Ridsdale, head of technology at Edison Group. \n\"Nvidia has carved out a dominant position in Generative AI... but there are other opportunities within AI and the industry will need viable competitors.\n\"But Graphcore will need substantial capital - it is a positive that Graphcore has found an investor willing to take the risk and provide the capital to put it in the mix.\"",
    "Scottish ministers are due to choose within months whether to give consent to build a new gas-fired power station on vacant land north-west of the existing one at Peterhead.\nEnvironmental campaigners are against the move, saying there is no logical case for allowing a new fossil fuel power station to be built.\nBut supporters say new carbon capture technology could slash emissions from the new site by more than 90%.\nThey say Peterhead 2 would have a system that could capture planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and send them via pipes from the power station to nearby St Fergus - where they would be injected into depleted oil wells under the North Sea about 50 miles offshore.\nThe current Peterhead facility has been generating electricity for more than four decades but it is now the last in Scotland to burn fossil fuels.\nKate Raffan has worked there as a chemist for 10 years and despite the long-term plan to wean Scotland off oil and gas, she did not think it was a bad move for her daughter to follow in her footsteps.\n\"It's an exciting time for the youth of today to get involved,\" she said.\n\"There are always skills to be learnt in every walk of this industry and they're very transferable.\"\nCatriona, now 19, began a commercial and procurement apprenticeship three years ago and was worried about whether it was a wise decision.\nBut she now thinks fossil fuels could remain part of Scotland's energy mix.\nThe imminent decision on Peterhead 2 is placing the SNP government in an awkward position, having previously opposed new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.\nA draft energy strategy contained a 'presumption against' new exploration but after pressure from within the party and the industry, that presumption could go.  \nEnergy firm SSE says the new Peterhead power station will be built so that more than 90% of the carbon it creates through burning gas can be captured and stored.\nBut opponents dispute that claim, saying no carbon capture and storage (CCS) scheme has ever consistently trapped that much CO2.\nThey claim the new power station could double Peterhead's greenhouse gas emissions for years.\nResearch by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research has questioned the effectiveness of CCS technology in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector.\nIts study says existing projects across the world - of which there are only about 50 - usually target 90% of emissions at peak capacity with some falling as low as 65% in the early years of deployment.\nThe existing Peterhead power station has been the most polluting site in Scotland for the past five years, responsible for emitting 1.35 million tonnes of CO2 in 2022.\nThe Tyndall study was commissioned by environmental campaign groups Friends of the Earth Scotland (FoES) and Global Witness.\nCaroline Rance, climate and energy campaigner at FoES, insists the new power station isn't needed because renewables are already generating the equivalent of all Scotland's electricity demands, with some excess being exported.\nBut aside from the environmental impact, she says that it's \"really bad for bills.\"\nShe says: \"We know that the cost of fossil fuels are driving up household bills and a new gas power station would just trap Scottish households into that same system for the next 25 years or more.\"\nSome environmentalists argue that CCS should be reserved for industries like cement and steel production where it's more challenging to find alternatives to fossil fuels which produce the super-high temperatures needed.\nThey say the electricity sector should focus instead on shifting to renewables like wind and solar.\nBut the Dundee-born chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Prof Jim Skea, has argued that CCS has an important role to play in energy generation.\nHe told the Financial Times that power stations could be the \"anchor\" source of carbon dioxide which make it economical to run CCS across larger industrial hubs.\nThat's exactly the plan for the Scottish CCS cluster at St Fergus which will pull CO2 from the industrial heartlands around central Scotland such as Grangemouth and Mossmorran. \nFinlay McCutcheon, managing director of SSE Thermal, which operates Peterhead power station, says gas provides a flexible means of generating electricity quickly when the National Grid needs it. \nHe said: \"I don't - and SSE doesn't - believe that you can have a wholly renewable system.\"\nHe added that energy storage, whether through large batteries or pumped storage hydro schemes, will play an important role during \"extended periods\" of low wind and solar generation.\nWhile campaigners say carbon capture is a licence for oil producers to continue \"business as usual\", the International Energy Agency (IEA) says rollout of it has been slow.\nClimate campaigners are concerned that the new Peterhead power station - if it's given the go-ahead - will be allowed to run for extended periods without the carbon being captured and stored - or that both the old and ",
    "A leading cybersecurity expert has warned that the NHS remains vulnerable to further cyber-attacks unless it updates its computer systems. \nThis stark assessment comes in the wake of a major ransomware attack that has severely disrupted healthcare services across London.\nProf Ciaran Martin, the founding CEO of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), told the BBC: \"I was horrified, but not completely surprised. Ransomware attacks on healthcare are a major global problem.\"\nNHS England said it was increasing its cybersecurity resilience and had invested \u00a3338m in the past seven years addressing this issue. \nBut Prof Martin's warnings suggest more urgent action may be needed.\nA recent British Medical Association report highlighted the NHS's ageing IT infrastructure, revealing that doctors waste 13.5 million hours annually due to outdated systems - equivalent to 8,000 full-time medics' time.\nThe 3 June cyber-attack, which Prof Martin described as one of the most serious in British history, targeted Synnovis, a pathology testing organisation, severely affecting services including at Guy's, St Thomas', King's College and Evelina London Children's Hospitals.\nNHS England declared it a regional incident, resulting in 4,913 acute outpatient appointments and 1,391 operations postponed and major data security concerns.\nThe Russian-based hacking group Qilin, believed to be part of a Kremlin-protected cyber army, demanded a \u00a340m ransom. When the NHS refused to pay, the group published stolen data on the dark web.\nThis incident reflects a growing trend of Russian cyber criminals targeting global healthcare systems.\nNow a professor at the University of Oxford, Prof Martin highlighted three critical issues facing NHS cybersecurity: outdated IT systems, the need to identify vulnerable points, and the importance of basic security practices. \nHe warned: \"In parts of the NHS estate, it's quite clear that some of the IT is out of date.\" \nHe stressed the importance of identifying \"single points of failure\" in the system and implementing better backups. \nProf Martin also emphasised that improving basic security measures could significantly hinder attackers, stating: \"Those little things make the point of entry quite a lot harder for the thugs to get in.\"\nEmphasising the severity of the recent attack, he concluded: \"It was obvious that this was going to be one of the most serious cyber incidents in British history because of the disruption to healthcare.\"\nSome front-line staff who spoke anonymously are very worried following the recent cyber attacks, with reference being made to outdated equipment they are using.\nA senior intensive care doctor in London warned: \"The NHS is vulnerable. \n\"It's a patient safety issue, but there's no interest in addressing it. People either don't know or don't want to hear about it.\"\nAn A&E consultant in north London told us they were working with \"decade-old computers and Windows 7\" and that their systems crashed \"every few months\" while a junior doctor highlighted the risks of outdated equipment and privatization.\n\"Old computers pose a security risk for patient data. The Synnovis incident shows how vulnerable we are,\" the doctor said.\nA senior orthopaedic surgeon described the fragmented nature of NHS IT: \"There's no unified system. A patient's X-ray in one hospital can't be accessed in another. \n\"It's shocking and worrying for cybersecurity.\"\nAnother junior doctor added: \"The NHS isn't doing enough. \n\"Cybersecurity is costly, and our funding has been cut for over a decade. \n\"It's incredibly frustrating.\"\nDr Daniel Gardham from the University of Surrey's Centre for Cyber Security echoed Prof Martin's concerns about outdated systems and their potential link to cyber-attacks.\n\"If you have old computers, then simply put, there's going to be unpatched vulnerabilities,\" he said. \n\"This means that there are ways in for attackers.\"\nDr Gardham stressed that while sophisticated attacks did occur, many breaches result from basic security oversights.\n\"It could be something really, really, simple and actually most likely it is something very, very, simple. \n\"It would be one person, perhaps, that had a weak password or left their computer unattended in a cafe. \n\"A lot of cyber security attacks are not sophisticated.\"\nAn NHS England spokesperson told the BBC: \"We are increasing cyber resilience across the NHS and over \u00a3338 million has been invested over the past seven years to help keep health and care organisations as safe as possible. \n\"Our ambitious Cyber Improvement Programme will support the NHS to respond to the changing cyber threats, expand protection and reduce the risk of a successful attack.\"\nContact us:\n\nIf you have something you'd like BBC London's investigations team to look into, get in touch, in confidence on: londoninvestigationsteam@bbc.co.uk\n",

For the narrative to then be about an 'agenda to force diversity' tarnishes the message,\" he said.\n\"We received quite - especially on my side - weird messages and comments: racially targeted and harassed. I had to say something.\"\nIn May the the 31-year-old actor posted a video on social media calling out \"constant targeted harassment from people who see diversity as a threat\". It has been viewed 1.7 million times.\n\"It was quite a shock because I had led with the intention to create a piece of work that was solely for my father,\" he said.\nMr Salim, keen to understand what motivated the hateful comments, began responding to some of the people sending him online messages.\n\"Nine times out of 10 we'd come to an agreement - we just really want to have a good time with the game,\" he said.\n\"I've always said I love criticism. I think that's just the the the nature of who I am as an actor. I want to always better and improve myself.\n\"Then, at the same time, you see these people who stoke these flames and who want this anger, who almost need it to fuel themselves, and it's a bit sad.\"\nOn Tuesday, Surgent Studios announced it would be making layoffs to staff.\nThe studio founder said it was a symptom of wider issues in the industry.\n\"The games industry is booming, but there are struggles which are not a reflection of the performance of games. It's a lot more complex that that,\" he said.\n\"It's a reflection of the accessibility of funding and the systemic nature of how to get it through. You have to wrestle with this ever-changing marketing space. That's the reality of the games industry.\"\nThe actor is currently starring in Game of Thrones spin-off House of Dragon as Alyn of Hull.\nStars of another major fantasy TV series, Rings of Power, have also spoken out about racist abuse online, but Mr Salim praised his fans for being supportive.\n\"As soon as it's mentioned, or someone says something stupid online, the House of the Dragon community just comes in, like, 'What are you chatting about? You're OK with dragons, but black people cross the line? What are you on, mate?'\"\nHe added: \"This goes beyond just games, the film and TV space - it goes into the world in general\n\"It's this feeling of making people feel like they are the enemy, and there is this divide when actually, in truth, what we all really truly want is to actually enjoy life and have a good time.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The Labour cabinet has planned for power, perhaps more than any government we've seen. And at the heart of its plan is... planning.\nThat's been identified as one of the main obstacles to picking up the pace of economic growth. Housebuilders and developers of vital infrastructure say that's a key part of what is holding them back.\nThey might also add a shortage of construction skills, the rising cost of materials, and the practice of land-banking by housebuilders - slowing development to a pace that does not undermine new-build prices.\nIt is the process of getting the green light from the local council that has been identified by the incoming Labour government as an early battlefield.\nIt's been the subject of the first big policy speech from Rachel Reeves, newly installed as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\nBeyond Labour's expectations, ministers have a problem with so many backbenchers. Lots of them, representing parts of leafy England where Labour MPs have rarely trod, will be under pressure from constituents to oppose developments.\nBut Labour has a mandate on this, and people who stand in the way of housebuilding and energy infrastructure (wind turbines, very high pylons, sub-stations and new nuclear power) are one group of which the new prime minister has said he's willing to make enemies.\nHowever, his writ doesn't run in Scottish planning. This \"national mission\" on economic growth has kicked off with planning, but it's up to the Scottish government and Scottish councils to make the planning system work.\nAnd few think it is working. There aren't enough planners. The big companies who want to develop wind farms on and offshore, and numerous other developments, are recruiting planners from councils, on better pay.\nAcross the UK between 2013 and 2020, a quarter of the council workforce switched to private employers, according to the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) which represents the profession. \nMore than four in five councils have trouble with recruiting.\nIn Scotland, RTPI reported in 2022 that staffing fell by a quarter in the previous decade, while gross spending on planning was down in real terms by 38%.\nIn April 2022, a fifth of graduate planning roles were vacant, and recruitment is going to get tougher: only 8% of council planners were under 30 and 39% were over 50, said the RTPI research.\nThe Scottish government concedes that there is a \"housing emergency\" - including rising levels of homelessness, and the cost to buy, to mortgage and to rent, which is most acute in some urban and rural tourism hot spots.\nScottish housing completions don't look like hitting a 10-year target set by ministers.\nAiming for 110,000 by 2032, one housing forum estimates it might hit 60,000.  Housing starts have fallen 15% in the most recent annual figures, and housing completions are down 17%.\nOn the bigger energy projects, the Scottish government has left SSE Networks to carry forward the necessary improvement in grid capacity to link the north of Scotland with markets in the south.\nIn areas of the Highlands and Aberdeenshire affected by planned new grid lines, there is a lot of anger, but concern also from the industry that it will continue to face obstacles and delays, including possible public inquiries.\nFourteen years to put a grid line in place is expensive, and will surely stall the ambitious plans for net zero.\nMinisters have been criticised for failing to sort out the planning application for the vast Berwick Bank offshore wind farm in time for its developer, SSE, to apply this year for a share of the subsidy - a guaranteed floor price - that is channelled to customer bills by the UK government and its regulator, Ofgem.\nThe renewable energy industry wonders aloud if governments are serious about getting to net zero on schedule, when it can't even manage one high-profile application.\nYet the Scottish government says such consents are a matter for the UK government, and it is working with Whitehall to get ready for many more applications for offshore wind in Scottish waters.\nDevelopers say there is a big and direct effect from speeding up the planning system, warning that Scotland faces very similar problems to England.\nKeith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, says: \u201cPrioritising clean energy infrastructure and building at speed and at scale will unleash strong economic growth across the country.\n\"If the UK can halve the time it takes to get renewables, electricity grid and storage projects through the planning system, we\u2019ll look to double our investment over the coming years.\u201d\nJane Woods, chief executive of Homes for Scotland, representing housebuilders, says Rachel Reeves speech on planning was \"very encouraging\"\n\"But with both of these matters devolved, will the Scottish government listen to those who are saying unequivocally 'it\u2019s not working for us' and recalibrate to change the alarming downwards trajectory on housing numbers,\" she asked.\n\"Will it bravely acknowledge that the root causes lie not ",
    "Residents in a Devon town have complained of being hit by \"massive\" rises in their water bills after smart meters were installed at their homes.\nSome South Molton residents said they were not given any notice by South West Water (SWW) their meters would be replaced, meaning they were unable to take a reading before it was swapped out.\nOne resident said she was billed \u00a33020 despite only paying about \u00a350 a month, while others said they were told there must be water leak when they complained.\nSWW said it was upgrading meters in north Devon as part of an environmental scheme, but it was unable to \"discuss individual customer accounts or their details\".\nDave Winter, who lives in South Molton, said he was not aware his water meter was going to be replaced.\nHe said his latest bill came to \u00a3260 despite normally paying about \u00a340. \n\"We're always very careful with water,\" he said.\n\u201cWe put enough in the kettle to make a cup of tea, we don't leave the taps running. \n\"We're very careful with the water, the trouble is South West Water are not.\"\nHe said the bill was eventually reduced to \u00a364 after his wife complained to the firm.\nOther residents in the South Molton area also contacted the BBC reporting similar problems.\nAfter doing a routine check of her online accounts, Maddy Tyler discovered her SWW account had been billed \u00a33020.\n\"I pay \u00a350.50 by standing order every month, I've never missed a payment,\" she said.\n\"My husband and I are retired pensioners, we don't have excessive use of water at all, we're very thrifty. \n\"I immediately went onto their WhatsApp line and said why is my bill \u00a33020, it's ridiculous.\"\nMs Tyler said an agent told her she would need to provide a new meter reading to \"verify the mistake\".\nShe said: \"The agent came back and said, 'Oh that is a mistake, in fact your payments a month should be \u00a337.50'.\n\"I really am glad I checked, I wouldn't have had that sort of money to pay it to begin with, but it's the principle that some people might and they're just sending in direct debits for whatever amount South West Water might say. \n\"I feel for some people that might not even know this has gone on.\"\nRachel, who did not want to give her surname, said her meter was changed \"without her knowledge\" resulting in a \"massive bill of over \u00a31000\".\n\"In the end I phoned and straight away, the agent put the bill on hold and was arranging to get the meter checked for a leak,\" she said.\n\"Three weeks later, this still hasn't been done.\n\"The meter readings that were on my bill were exactly the same as my neighbours for the old meter and new, none of it makes sense.\"\nShe said the \"massive bill\" had made her \"extremely anxious\".\n\"We struggle to get by as it is,\" she said.\nSWW said it \"can't discuss individual customer accounts or their details\", but added: \"We will always respond directly to anyone who has concerns about a bill so that we can help resolve their query.\"\nIt said it was changing and upgrading meters in north Devon as part of its Green Recovery Programme, which is aimed at \"improving public health, protecting the environment, and addressing climate change\".\nSWW said the process involved sending correspondence before any meters were exchanged. \nThe firm said a final meter read would be taken during the exchange to update the customer's account, with a new meter installed starting on 0.\nIt said installing smart meters was aimed at helping customers manage their water use and bills more easily.",
    "Guess who's back, back again? \nEminem's latest album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Gr\u00e2ce), has been released and is being met with mixed reviews by critics. \nIn the US rapper's 12th album, his alter ego Slim Shady is killed off - the artwork shows Shady in a body bag, and in the music video for Tobey, Eminem takes a chainsaw to him.\nClash called the album \"a mixed bag\" and described it as \"at once an effective piece of fan service, while also being a record that disappoints\".\n\"It doesn\u2019t quite feel like an ending, but neither does it feel like a continuation,\" Robin Murray wrote.\n\"A mixed, often muddled album, it features some of Eminem\u2019s best rapping in a decade \u2013 those fast, skippy-yet-intricate flows will never fail to thrill \u2013 but his pen is often blunted.\"\nAhead of the release, Eminem told fans this is a \"conceptual album\" and the songs should be listened to in order. \nThe 19 tracks include previously released singles Tobey and Houdini, as well as a sequel to his 1999 hit Guilty Conscience with Dr Dre. \nBillboard ranked the latter song as one of the best on the new album and said \"it\u2019s not the original, but is a worthy second coming\".\n\"At one point, Slim Shady puts Marshall on blast for creating him as an alter-ego to stir up controversy and essentially be a shield to say jarring things that he didn\u2019t really have the courage to stand on,\" Michael Saponara wrote.\nUSA Today said the 51-year-old is a \"lyrical pugilist throughout, except when he turns misty-eyed dad rapping about daughter Hailie Jade\". \nHis song Temporary starts with old recordings of the rapper and his daughter talking as a child. \nMelissa Ruggieri said it was the most memorable song on the album \"because it gives Eminem permission to drop the shtick and explore his vulnerability \u2013 which isn\u2019t often apparent elsewhere on the album\".\nEminem calls on his 28-year-old daughter to \"be strong\" and that he will always be her rock.\nOn his track Fuel, Eminem references the multiple sexual assault allegations against fellow rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.\n\"I'm like an R-A-P-E-R/I got so many S-As/S-As/Wait, he didn't just spell the word rapper and leave out a 'P', did he?\" the lyrics say.\nPitchfork said Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers III, \"reckons with his controversies while taking pains to create new one\". \nThe track Antichrist \"take pains to offend as crudely as possible\" with references to pronouns, woke society and \"the harrowing video of Diddy attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie in a hotel in 2016\".\nMr Combs, one of rap's most successful moguls, apologised for his \"inexcusable\" actions shown in that video, and has denied all allegations of sexual assault.\nA review by the Independent gave the album two stars and said the rapper was \"punching downwards, joylessly and without inspiration\". \n\"Much of The Death Of Slim Shady resembles a Telegraph op-ed: the ham-fisted mashing of people\u2019s buttons, the blethering about 'the PC police' and 'Gen Z' coming to get him. Anything to get a reaction,\" Stevie Chick wrote.  ",
    "Residents who say they are living in a \"toxic zone\" are fearful for their health after plumes of black smoke have invaded their homes.\nFor much of last week, the sky above Kirkby in Merseyside, was filled with burning debris and a thick black smoke which could be seen for miles around. \nTwo large-scale fires erupted on two different industrial estates in and around Knowsley, beginning with an incident on Saturday 29 June.\nKnowsley Council said it had \"shared significant concerns with relevant bodies - including the Environment Agency - regarding the safety and management of both of the sites\".\nThe fires are the latest in a series of environmental incidents which is causing distress for local residents, who say they are fearful of the potential health implications.\nMerseyside Fire & Rescue Service were called to Pingwood Lane in Kirkby on 29 June where they found seven articulated lorries on fire. \nThree days later, emergency services were called to the scene of an industrial fire at a recycling centre on Wilson Road in Huyton.\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service writes that as a result of both incidents, plumes of black smoke and a toxic smell plagued thousands of people across Knowsley, and parts of Lancashire, for days - with people warned to keep windows and doors shut.\nThe fires are part of a wider environmental concern as residents have lodged complaints for over a year about foul smells from industrial sites just outside Kirkby.\nNeil Dunne, who organised a residents' meeting, said: \"It feels like we are living in a toxic zone where our health is being put at risk.\n\"The black smoke just raised the same alarms over local pollution fears. Pollution levels in Kirkby are very worrying and lung health in Kirkby is generally poor. \n\"This creates more problems as people get older.\"\nA Knowsley Council spokesman said: \u201cPrior to the incidents this week, we have shared significant concerns with relevant bodies including the Environment Agency regarding the safety and management of both of the sites where the fires have taken place.\n\"For some time we have had concerns over how (the industrial estates) are being managed. And specifically the negative environmental impact this is having on our residents in Kirkby \u2013 which is just adjacent to these sites.\n\"In terms of the Wilson Road site we have been concerned about the volumes of waste being stored and have raised these concerns with the Environment Agency who regulate the site and are able to take enforcement action.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A woman accused of lying about her nursing qualifications at a neonatal unit in Bridgend was also accused of stealing money raised for it, Cardiff Crown Court has heard.\nThe court was told that \u00a3860 was collected for the ward in September 2019 by a mother of a premature baby who ran a half-marathon.\nNeonatal ward manager Tanya Nasir, 45, denies nine counts of fraud and fraud by false representation.\nShe described the allegation that she had taken the charity money as \"awful.\"\nShe began working in the unit in September that year, and was suspended in February 2020 following concerns about her CV. She resigned in November 2020 two days before a planned disciplinary hearing.\nIt is claimed Ms Nasir, from Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, lied about her qualifications and experience to get the band seven post at the hospital unit, which cares for ill and premature babies.\nThe court has heard that Ms Nasir claimed to have substantial experience working with premature babies and in adult intensive care.\nShe also said that she had served in the Army as a medic, with service \u201cin a field hospital 500 metres (0.3 miles) from the front line\u201d in Afghanistan, as well as in Iraq, Syria, Kosovo, Haiti, Bosnia, Malawi, and Zambia. \nAdditionally, she claimed to hold the ranks of major and colour sergeant.\nHowever, the court was informed that checks of Ministry of Defence records found no evidence of her serving in the Army or the Reserves. It was revealed that she was an adult volunteer with the Army Cadets but had never seen active service.\nMs. Nasir was arrested by Dyfed-Powys Police at her home in Brecon in spring 2021 and questioned by NHS counter-fraud investigators.\nOn Monday, the court heard testimony about a mother who ran a half-marathon and raised \u00a3860 for the unit, which she handed to Ms Nasir in December 2019.\nInterview transcripts read in court said investigators Beverley Jones and Neil Jones informed Ms Nasir there was \u201cno trace of the \u00a3860 ever being recorded\u201d. The defendant described the allegation as \u201cawful,\u201d adding: \u201cI\u2019m actually really upset by this.\u201d\nShe said she and the mother met and spoke in the unit\u2019s reception area when the sponsorship money was delivered.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I even opened it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe lady told me it was \u00a3800 and something.\u201d\nWhen asked by investigators why she didn\u2019t open the envelope and count the money, she said: \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to count money out in front of someone.\u201d\nThe investigators said counting it out would have been the most appropriate action to take.\nThey told her: \u201cYou were in a position of trust. You accepted \u00a3860 in cash from a family who had undertaken a half marathon\u201d.\nMs Nasir said another nurse on the unit also accepted donations.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t steal the money,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cOne of you has,\u201d they told her.\n\u201cThat\u2019s awful, absolutely disgusting,\u201d she said.\nThe court was also informed that Ms Nasir was addressed as \u201cdoctor\u201d by teachers at her daughter\u2019s school and in letters from credit companies.\nIn a letter sent in 2010 to authorise out-of-school trips, she was addressed as Dr Nasir, and a subsequent letter about a prize-giving day began with \"Dear Dr Nasir.\"\nWhen investigators asked why this was the case, she replied: \u201cI am not claiming to be a doctor; it\u2019s a courtesy because they knew I was a healthcare professional. I\u2019m not a doctor, I\u2019m a nurse.\u201d\nThe court further heard that when police officers searched her home in John Street, Brecon, they found several certificates. NHS counter-fraud investigators told her they believed these certificates were fakes.\nOne certificate was for a master\u2019s in leadership, purportedly issued by the \"Royal British Army\" and Reading University. She was informed it was a forgery, and the university had no record of a student named Tanya Nasir. She responded: \u201cI completed the online course, and that was the certificate I was sent.\u201d\nThe search also uncovered a presentation folder containing certificates and documents to support her application for the senior role in the neonatal unit at the Princess of Wales Hospital.\nAmong these was a certificate from the \u201cRoyal British Army\u201d stating she was required to attend training camps in Zambia and Malawi in 2019. The document described the late Queen as \u201cthe defender of faith.\u201d\nChallenged by the investigators, Ms. Nasir admitted, \u201cYeah, no, some of that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d When asked why it was in her application folder, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t even know what this is talking about.\u201d\nThe trial continues.",
    "Five people linked to one of Ecuador's biggest criminal gangs have been jailed for the murder of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio last year. \nMr Villavicencio, a member of the country's national assembly and an ex-journalist, was shot dead as he left a campaign rally in the capital, Quito, last August. \nCarlos Angulo, the alleged leader of the Los Lobos gang, and Laura Castilla were sentenced to 34 years and eight months in prison for directing the hit. \nTwo men and a woman were handed 12-year sentences by the court in Quito for aiding a hit squad in the attack. \nProsecutors alleged that Angulo - widely known as The Invisible - ordered the hit from the Quito prison in which he is detained. \nHe denied the charges, claiming he was being made a \"scapegoat\" for the hit. \nCastilla was left in charge of logistics for the hit. She allegedly supplied weapons, money and motorcycles to the men to carry out the hit.\nThe others - Erick Ramirez, Victor Flores and Alexandra Chimbo - were accused of helping the hit squad track Mr Villavicencio's movements. \nMore than 70 people gave evidence during the trial, including a key witness who said the gang had been offered more than $200,000 (\u00a3154,000) to kill Mr Villavicencio.\nA crusading anti-corruption activist, Mr Villavicencio had been one of the few candidates to allege links between organised crime and government officials in Ecuador.\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, the politician had received death threats and been given a security detail. But he continued to campaign and was gunned down by a group of assailants on 9 August outside a school in the north of Quito.\nProsecutors said during the trial that one of the men involved in the assassination was shot dead in a confrontation with police at the scene. \nSix other men - all Colombian nationals - were later arrested in connection with the killing, but were subsequently found murdered at El Litoral prison, where they were being held in pre-trial detention.\nA separate investigation into who contracted Los Lobos to carry out the hit remains ongoing, prosecutors have said. \nMr Villavicencio's widow, Veronica Sarauz, welcomed the ruling. But she said it only marked the beginning of a long road to determine the entire story behind her husband's death. \nEcuador has historically been a relatively safe and stable country in Latin America, but crime has shot up in recent years, fuelled by the growing presence of Colombian and Mexican drug cartels, which have infiltrated local criminal gangs.\nThe Los Lobos gang led by Angulo is said to have deep connections to the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel in Mexico.

    "With decisions on everything from civil rights and the environment to guns and religious freedoms, the US Supreme Court has always played a powerful role in American life.\nBut that role has been changing in some ways, with the court's nine justices - unelected and able to serve for life - now looming larger in the country's politics.\nAs the grand finale of its 2023-2024 term, the court issued a decision to settle what Chief Justice John Roberts wrote was a \"question of lasting significance\", by ruling that Donald Trump and other ex-presidents have a wide (but not absolute) immunity from criminal prosecution for their actions in office.\nWhile Trump hailed the decision as a \"big win\" for democracy, President Joe Biden said it undermined the \"rule of law\" and was a \"terrible disservice\" to Americans. \nLet's take a look at the Supreme Court and how the staid and historically respected body has become a political battlefield.\nPut simply, the Supreme Court is the keeper of US laws.\nThe justices decide whether laws and government actions follow the US constitution. They also interpret laws passed by congress to decide if they are being correctly carried out.\nLower courts have to follow the precedent set by the Supreme Court, under a legal principle known as \"stare decisis\" - Latin for \"to stand by a decision\". That gives its decisions national and long-term importance.\nMost cases reach the Supreme Court by climbing up a ladder of appeals through lower federal courts or the state courts.  Even though the Supreme Court receives more than 7,000 petitions a year, it only hears about 100 or so cases each term. The justices follow the \"Rule of Four\", where they review a case if four of them believe it has merit.\nBy design, the court is supposed to be insulated from political change and the justices from political pressure in making their decisions.\nAmericans do not vote for who can serve on the court. Justices are appointed by the president and then approved by the Senate. \nThey serve for life or until they voluntarily retire, and they can only be removed by impeachment. Congress has only attempted an impeachment once, more than 200 years ago, and it failed.\nIn practice, the court structure means that one of the most consequential decisions a president can make is picking a justice. \nCurrently, conservatives hold a strong majority with six justices on the bench.\nThree of them -  Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - were appointed by Trump. \nRepublican Presidents George W Bush and George HW Bush appointed John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas.\nTwo of the three liberal judges - Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan - were nominated by Barack Obama. Ketanji Brown Jackson was picked by Mr Biden. \nPolitics have played a role in appointments \"since the very beginning of this country\", said Jonathan Entin, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio who researches the Supreme Court. But the fractiousness of current politics has changed the dynamics on and around the court. \n\"Democrat presidents tended to appoint Democrats and Republican presidents tended to appoint Republicans,\" he said. \"What's changed is that the parties themselves have become more polarised.\" \n\"People in both parties have paid particular attention to judicial ideology going forward,\" Mr Entin added. \"So it's much more contentious than it used to be.\" \nThe court has only had its current make-up, with conservatives dominating the bench, since 2022. But in that short stretch, it has created a massive shift in the country, starting with ending the constitutional right to abortion in June of that year. \nIn just the last few weeks, along with presidential immunity, it ruled that federal prosecutors overreached when they used an obstruction law against 6 January rioters, struck down a ban on federal \"bump stock\" devices for guns, and rejected an effort to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone.\nIt also slashed and weakened the powers of agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency by overturning a previous ruling that judges should defer to federal agencies in interpreting ambiguous parts of laws. That decision, along with other recent rulings related to regulations, will move many powers from federal agencies to the court system.\nLast year, the justices also struck down US President Joe Biden's proposal to wipe out billions in student debt and that race-based university admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina could no longer be used, upending decades-old US policies on so-called affirmative action. \nThe Supreme Court goes to enormous lengths to protect its internal deliberations, with almost all its work - such as reading briefs or writing and circulating  - taking place behind closed doors. \nBecause its process seems almost impenetrable, the country was shocked when the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v Wade was leaked to the press.\nFace-to-face deliberations, similarly, take place",
    "Some hospitals have reintroduced mask wearing after a spike in patients being admitted with Covid-19, so should we be worried the virus is making a comeback?\nSince Monday, patients, visitors and staff are required to wear masks in clinical areas at the Royal Stoke University Hospital and County Hospital in Stafford. \nIn Worcestershire, the Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said the measure was necessary \"to protect patients, their loved ones and hospital staff from risk of infection\" .\nThey are currently treating 65 patients with Covid-19, the highest number since December 2023. Patients are also in hospital for longer so that would indicate they are sicker too.\nIn Staffordshire, there are 108 patients with the virus. At Royal Stoke Hospital two wards are currently full with Covid patients.\nBut it is difficult to tell if this is some sort of \"summer Covid wave\" because we are doing a lot less testing than we used to. \nMost of the testing these days is done of hospital patients when they are admitted and yes, we are seeing a bit of an uptick,  indeed it might be higher than the numbers suggest as not all new patients are tested.\nBut let's put these new cases in context.\nWith about 170 infected patients in the last few weeks in Staffordshire and Worcestershire that is a lot fewer than we saw at the height of the pandemic.\nAt the end of 2021 going in to 2022, we saw a peak in England of nearly 300,000 new cases a day and there are no signs we are even remotely close to a return to those sort of numbers.\nAs for what is driving this small rise in cases, well Covid-19 as a virus is constantly evolving and yes that means new variants. If you remember it was the Omicron variant that drove that huge peak of 300,000 cases.\nCurrently, we are seeing a descendent of that Omicron variant, JN1, dominating things and in fact, there are even newer mutations of JN1, that we are keeping an eye on collectively, called FliRT. (Flirt is an acronym that's to do with the locations of the mutations on the virus, if you are wondering.)\nBut, it is too early to tell if FliRT variants are driving this small increase in infection.\nThe truth is Covid-19 is now part of life.

    "Plans for a regional sewage treatment plant in the west of the Isle of Man, which would prevent the pumping of raw sewage out to sea have been approved.\nThe Peel Sewage Treatment Works, situated west of Glenfaba Road, were unanimously supported by the member of the planning committee.\nManx Utilities' plans are part of the government's \u00a340m regional treatment project, with Peel one of two remaining outstanding areas to be addressed.\nChairman of Manx Utilities John Wannenburgh said the approval meant it was \"one step closer to finally putting an end to the discharge of raw sewage to sea for our island\".\n\"On completion, the works will provide a huge improvement to our marine environment and to Peel,\" he added.\nManx utilities said construction was due to start in early autumn, with the facility due to be functional by the end of 2026. \nUnder the proposals, sewage will be pumped from the existing Peel sewage pumping station on the town's promenade to the site of the treatment plant. \nOnce treated, the waste will flow by gravity, connecting to current infrastructure and will be discharged through the existing sea outfall. \nThe plans would see the construction of a new site access road, a motor control centre, seven integral rotating biological contactors to treat the waste, flow distribution chambers, UV treatment facilities and odour control units.\nThe planning officer who recommended the plans be approved told the committee that the lack of modern treatment of sewage in Peel was \"not an acceptable situation for the environment\".\nWhile there were two previous applications that were not supported by officers, in this case the site was \"well suited and well located\", he added.\nAn owner of land nearby shared concerns about the impacts that the odour would have on neighbouring land which included a nursing home, and a \"substantial amount of residential properties\".\nBut planning committee member Sam Skelton said the plans were a matter of \"national need\" and the proposals were for the best location.\nThose opposed to the plans have three weeks to lodge an appeal against the decision.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X?

    "The rural Irish village of Muff is an unlikely place for an Oscar-winning actor, a former member of Irish boy band royalty and an award-winning radio host to meet on a rainy Tuesday.\nWhile all eyes were on Dublin last week as global superstar Taylor Swift rolled into the Republic of Ireland\u2019s capital as part of her Eras Tour, it was the turn of this tiny spot in County Donegal to roll out the red carpet (quite literally).\nHopeful locals lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Gladiator star Russell Crowe, Irish singer-songwriter Ronan Keating and Irish TV and radio presenter Ryan Tubridy as they arrived to open a new state-of-the-art distillery, which has been described as a huge boost to local economy.\nThey, along with pop megastar Ed Sheeran and British comedian Jimmy Carr, are all investors in the Muff Liquor Company.\nThe firm was set up by Laura Bonner back in 2017, and the company has now transformed a former car dealership in the centre of the village into a distillery. \nCrowe's arrival was cheered by a large crowd, including some who had waited for hours in the rain. \nHe told BBC News NI he had received a phenomenal reception since arriving in Ireland. \nThe Oscar-winning actor added it was his first visit to County Donegal and that he was delighted to come to this picturesque part of the island. \nThe star of films such as A Beautiful Mind, The Nice Guys and Robin Hood joked that he didn\u2019t know this many people owned cameras here as he was swarmed by the media and the many locals hoping to get a picture of the movie star.\nCrowe added that he and the other celebrities involved in the project wanted the new distillery in Muff to be somewhere that \"employs local people and is something that local people in the village can be proud of\". \nAlicia O\u2019Kane, who has lived in Muff for 17 years but is originally from Londonderry, said she wouldn\u2019t miss today for the world.\nShe waited in the rain for more than two hours in the hope she would meet some of the famous visitors. \nMs O\u2019Kane said she has \u201cnever seen such a buzz about the village\u201d and wanted to be there today to give the celebrities a \u201cproper Donegal welcome\u201d.\nShe confessed she may have frightened Ronan Keating off after shouting \u2018welcome to Muff, Ronan\u2019 very loudly at him, but believes he took the \u201cwarm welcome\u201d in good spirits as he posed for a quick selfie afterwards.\nKara Saunders, who is also from Derry, was allowed to leave work early to make the short journey over the border from Northern Ireland to try to catch a glimpse of her idol Ronan Keating.\n\u201cAll my friends were tagging me in posts on Facebook when they heard he would be coming here,\u201d she told BBC News NI.\nKara has been a fan of Ronan since she was a teenager, from his days in Boyzone, and has followed him right through his solo career.\nShe said she is a huge fan of his music and, despite other well-known names being here, she only has eyes for him.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Keating, who hails from Dublin, said he enjoyed many family holidays to Donegal as a child and is really excited about being involved in a business on this beautiful spot on the island.\nHe said hard-working small Irish communities like this one in Muff are the \u201cbackbone of Ireland\" and he is excited about the potential here. \n\"It's nice for us to be a part of this, my Irish heritage is really important to me. \n\"We used to pass through small villages like this all the time and it's great to be able to spread the village of Muff all over the world.\"\nGrainne McCool, a writer from Muff, said she is delighted that some big names are in the village.\nShe hoped it will bring a boost to tourism and increase footfall for other local businesses\n\"Things like this bring the village alive, it brings people out and makes us feel special,\" she said. \n\"The village is known for its name and people sort of laugh about us, but this will make people take the village of Muff a lot more seriously.\" ",
    "Jewish people in the EU continue to face high levels of antisemitism, according to the latest survey from the bloc's Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA). \nMore than 8,000 Jews in 13 EU countries, including Germany and France, were interviewed - with 96% saying they had encountered antisemitism in their daily life. \nThe vast majority had experienced harassment online. \nThe FRA's director, Sirpa Rautio, warned that Europe was facing a \"wave of antisemitism\" - driven partly by the conflict in the Middle East.\nShe warned that this was severely limiting the ability of Jewish people in EU countries to \"live in safety and with dignity\".\nThe survey, which looked at participants' experiences in the year before it was carried out, took place in the first half of 2023 - before the 7 October Hamas attacks and Israel's resulting military campaign in Gaza.\nHowever, the FRA said there had been a dramatic rise in reported antisemitic attacks since the Gaza war began.\nIt was sparked when gunmen from Hamas and other Palestinian groups attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage on 7 October last year. \nIsrael's retaliatory attacks have since killed 38,295 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe FRA said its research over the years had found that antisemitism tends to increase in times of tension in the Middle East.\nIt added that 75% of those who took part in their latest survey felt that they were held responsible for the Israeli government\u2019s actions because they are Jewish.\nWhile 90% of respondents said they had encountered antisemitism on the internet, the FRA said \"antisemitic harassment and violence mostly take place in streets, parks, or shops\". \nMore than half of those surveyed expressed concern for their own safety or that of their family, while 76% said they hid their Jewish identity at least occasionally, \nThe organisation also collected responses from 12 Jewish organisations in January and February this year and found a dramatic increase in the number of reported antisemitic attacks across all surveyed countries. These attacks included personal harassment, intimidation and violence. \nIn Austria and Sweden, antisemitic incidents had increased by more than 400% in October to December last year compared to the same period in 2022.\nIn 2022, Denmark had reported only nine antisemitic incidents, but this increased to 121 last year.\nThe FRA warned that the safety concerns and the protection of Jewish people and institutions had become urgent.\nIt has called on governments to do more to fund the security needs of Jewish communities such as at schools and synagogues.\n\"We need to build on existing laws and strategies to protect communities from all forms of hate and intolerance, online as well as offline,\" Ms Rautio said. \nThe FRA also called on governments to use the EU's Digital Services Act to remove antisemitic content online, and step up efforts to prosecute antisemitic hate crimes.",
    "Former nurse Lucy Letby has been found guilty of trying to kill a premature baby girl.\nThe 34-year-old was convicted of attempting to murder the child, referred to in court as Baby K, following a retrial.\nIn a statement, Baby K's family described having to endure a \"long, torturous and emotional journey - twice\".\n\"Today, justice has been served. But it does not take away the extreme hurt, anger and distress that we have all had to experienced,\" they said.\nLast August, Letby was convicted by a different jury of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of six others at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.\nHowever, a verdict on the allegation relating to Baby K could not be reached, and a retrial was ordered, heard at Manchester Crown Court.\nThe retrial jury found her guilty of trying to murder the \"very premature\" infant by dislodging her breathing tube in the early hours of 17 February 2016.\nThe parents of Baby K gasped and then cried as the jury foreman read out the verdict following three-and-a-half hours of deliberation. \nLetby showed no emotion in the dock.\nDet Ch Insp Nicola Evans, of Cheshire Police, praised the \"courage, strength and resilience\" of the child's parents, who she said had been forced to face \"continual denials\" from Letby.\n\u201cI would like to thank them for continuing to put their faith in us and I hope that the conclusion today provides them with some peace of mind and some of the answers they have been searching for,\" she said.\n\u201cOnce again, there are no winners in this case. Today is not a time for celebration \u2013 it is a time for reflection and a time for the family of Baby K.\"\nThe court heard how Letby had targeted the child after she was moved from the delivery room to the neo-natal unit shortly after her premature birth.\nThe jury agreed that the former nurse had dislodged the baby\u2019s breathing tube and stood by her incubator watching her blood oxygen levels drop, without intervening.\nConsultant paediatrician Dr Ravi Jayaram had caught her \"virtually red-handed\" as he entered the unit's intensive care room at about 03:45.\nDr Jayaram, who intervened to resuscitate the child, told jurors he saw \"no evidence\" that Letby had done anything to help the deteriorating baby.\nHe said he heard no call for help from Letby, or alarms sounding as Baby K's blood oxygen levels suddenly dropped.\nLetby told the jury of six women and six men she had no recollection of any such event.\nShe denied she did anything harmful to Baby K and repeatedly insisted she had not committed any of the offences of which she had been convicted.\nBaby K was transferred to a specialist hospital later on 17 February because of her extreme prematurity and died there three days later, with the cause of death certified as extreme prematurity and severe respiratory distress syndrome.\nMore than two years later in April 2018, Letby searched on Facebook for Baby K\u2019s surname, the court heard.\nProsecutor Nick Johnson KC said it was part of a pattern of similar Facebook searches, telling the jury: \"The truth is that Lucy Letby had a fascination with the babies she had murdered and attempted to murder, and with their families. \n\"She took pleasure in her murderous handiwork.\"\nLetby\u2019s lawyers had argued her convictions should be quashed at an appeal as jurors may not have been certain of her guilt, it can now be reported.\nHer legal team unsuccessfully brought a Court of Appeal challenge in April this year over her previous murder and attempted murder convictions. \nHer barrister Ben Myers KC argued that the trial judge, Mr Justice Goss, was wrong to tell the jury they did not need to be sure of the precise act which caused Letby\u2019s victims harm.\nHe said: \u201cThey should have been told they should have been sure of the act. They have to have certainty as to the act that lay behind the allegations of deliberate harm.\u201d\nBut prosecutor Mr Johnson KC, stated the argument was \u201cnot tenable\u201d and that while medical evidence was \u201cat the heart of pretty much all\u201d of the prosecution\u2019s argument, it formed \u201conly part of the circumstances of the case\u201d and that Letby \u201cwas always there when things happened\u201d.\nOther arguments were also made by Letby's defence team, including how the judge had dealt with \"jury irregularity\".\nDame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Holroyde dismissed Letby\u2019s bid in May and their written reasons were published shortly after Letby's latest conviction.\nDr Nigel Scawn, medical director at the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said he was \"extremely sorry that these awful crimes happened at our hospital\".\nHe added: \"Since Lucy Letby worked at our hospital, we have made significant changes to our services and remain committed to providing high quality safe care to our local communities.\"\nDr Scawn acknowledged the impact that the Letby case continued to have on everyone involved, adding he was \"grateful for the unwavering cooperation and professionalism of our staff, som",

    "A walk, a cuppa and a bit of banter are being used to tackle loneliness in older people in Northern Ireland.\nAge NI has said Northern Ireland's social care system is \"broken, invisible and forgotten\".\nThe absence of care packages, longer hospital waiting lists and fewer community services has left the elderly feeling isolated and vulnerable, the older people's charity has said.\nIt hopes its new service will help keep older people safe and part of their own community.\nThrough the scheme, Michael Lawson, 90, was matched with Mark Logan, who at 64 is semi-retired.\nThey meet up two or three times a week, which can include a walk, a visit to a local attraction and definitely a cuppa.\nMichael, from Larne, described the match as \"very good\" as he can share with Mark, who lives in nearby Whitehead, his love for orchestral music, books and the theatre.\nWithin minutes of meeting them, their bond is obvious.\nLikening themselves to Morecambe and Wise, the banter never stops as they chat over coffee with Glenarm Castle in County Antrim in the background.\nCharity director Dr Paschal McKeown told BBC News NI that \"early intervention is key\" so that people are not being helped mid-crisis when they have already reached \"breaking point\".\nIt describes 'Shared Lives Carers' as an innovative, upbeat scheme matching the elderly with a suitable carer.\nMark said he would like the service rolled out across Northern Ireland as \"there are lots of Michaels out there needing support\", but also lots of other people like him who have time on their hands to give a little back.\n\"The health service tries to put years back into somebody's life, but I try to put life back into somebody\u2019s years so that they can enjoy life again both in and outside their home,\" Mark said.\nIt's people like Michael, who is physically and mentally fit, but who also depends on carers coming into his home every day, that Shared Lives wants to target.\nDelivered by Age NI and funded by the Department of Health, the service is about early intervention and supporting older people to remain at home for as long as possible.\nThe message is that staying connected within the community can help prevent illness, falls, depression and hopefully keep older people out of hospital.\n\nTo be eligible, the older person must be referred to the scheme by a social worker, then a suitable carer is matched from a pool of people who have undergone a security check in advance.\nThe carer, who is paid, will be expected to share their home, family and community life with the older person for several hours each week.\nAccording to Michael, his social care package - which includes Shared Lives - targeted his individual needs. \nHe said it means he can stay at home with his collection of books and recordings, but with people watching out for him.\n\"My carers come each morning and evening to check on me and to make sure I am alright. \n\"But in between and in my days out with Mark I get to do the fun bits like being here at Glenarm - I would never do that on my own steam,\" said Michael.\nPaschal McKeown from Age NI says people often do not know what social care is until they need it themselves.\n\"Largely, social care is invisible and often happens behind closed doors in people's homes, in day centres and care homes. So it is much more invisible and can be easily forgotten,\" she said.\n\"Social care is complex, because it is about individual people - what they need, and how we deliver personalised care to them in a way that suits them.\"\nHow adult social care is shaped and delivered is a conversation that's being had across the UK.\nIMPACT, a national centre which is working to improve adult social care across the four nations, is looking at practical ways to make a difference to services and people's lives.\nThe overarching feeling is that there is a need to move to a different model and to spend available money differently.\nSharing the Northern Ireland experience with her UK Counterparts, Professor Deirdre Heenan said the \u00a315m project spanning six years was focused on pinpointing evidence of interventions proven to work.\nThe thrust of this was giving people the support needed to maximise their years of independent living, she said.\n\"Our evidence is very much based around prevention and early intervention in terms of social care. We know that we can predict who's likely to need assistance in terms of loneliness and rural isolation.\n\"We know that taking a preventative approach is actually more cost-effective. People want to live independently as long as possible within their own communities, but also want to have a quality of life, which means that life for them is worth living,\" said Prof Heenan.",
    "An alternative healer on trial for manslaughter lied during a police interview to avoid being mistaken for a doctor, a court has heard.\nHongchi Xiao, 61, of Cloudbreak in California, made the admission under cross-examination at Winchester Crown Court, where he is facing prosecution over the death of Danielle Carr-Gomm at a slapping therapy workshop in Wiltshire in 2016. \nThe court previously heard that when police asked him if he had given Ms Carr-Gomm - a Type 1 diabetic seeking an alternative to insulin - personal advice about her medication, he said he had not. \nBut Mr Xiao, who denies manslaughter, admitted earlier that this was not true and that he had told her at the Wiltshire workshop the day before she died to resume taking her insulin.\nMs Carr-Gomm, 71, died during a residential workshop partly led by Mr Xiao in Seend, Wiltshire, from a complication typical of diabetics who do not take insulin.\nThe workshop promoted a treatment known as \u2018paida lajin\u2019 - in which people slap themselves and each other to expel poisons from the body.\nHe told the court: \u201cThe police were trying to get me into a position of a medical doctor. If you say take or stop, that is the role of a doctor. I was afraid of the police, I admit.\u201d\nMr Xiao has been open in court that he has no medical training.\nHe also denied that if he had asked Ms Carr-Gomm to resume taking insulin at the Wiltshire workshop, she would have done so.\nHe said Mrs Carr-Gomm was \u201cstubborn\u201d and \u201cshe didn\u2019t listen to me\u201d, even though Ms Carr-Gomm had described him as like a \"messenger from God\".\nMr Xiao said he found her the evening before she died \u201cweak and tired\u201d in her room at the hotel in Seend but said she understood what he was saying.\nHe said: \u201cI asked her first of all to eat and then to drink tea and then to take insulin.\u201d\nHe thought she was in the midst of a \u2018healing crisis\u2019, which he believes occurs as the body heals itself after paida lajin therapy.\nInitially, she refused food and drink but eventually drank ginger tea and ate some couscous.\nThe court heard he first met Mrs Carr-Gomm at a workshop in Bulgaria the previous year. \nShe became ill after cutting insulin and fasting.\nMr Xiao told her then that she should resume eating and drinking and continue to take insulin - which she did.\nMr Xiao also repeatedly said he always told participants not to cut medication suddenly but to do it gradually.\nShe provided him with a glowing testimonial after that workshop and said she had been able to reduce her insulin by half.\nBecoming enthusiastic about paida lajin, she offered courses herself at her home and booked to attend the workshop in Seend, Wiltshire.\nHe said Mrs Carr-Gomm told him in Wiltshire she had checked and her blood sugar was normal.\nMr Xiao denied congratulating her on this - as the prosecution have claimed - but said he was pleased about it, because he believed it showed his paida lajin therapy worked and had \u201cscientific proof\".\nMrs Carr-Gomm died during the course from ketoacidosis, a known complication for diabetics who stop taking insulin.\nThe case continues.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A police dog has died while pursuing a suspect wanted in connection with a double stabbing.\nThe Leicestershire Police dog - namely PD Zyla - was deployed after a report the man wanted by officers had been spotted at Watermead Country Park in Birstall on Wednesday.\nPD Zyla followed the man who entered the water at the park, but became unresponsive, officers said.\nA 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.\nIt is the eighth arrest in connection with a double stabbing in Wilford street, in Nottingham's city centre, in the early hours of Sunday 23 June.\nHe remains in police custody, while others have been bailed under conditions. \nA 26-year-old man previously detained on suspicion of attempted murder was de-arrested for the offence and then arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, police said. \nOfficers also previously arrested a 22-year-old man on suspicion of assisting an offender, and five other men \u2013 aged 24, 32, 35, 37, and 40 \u2013 were detained on suspicion of violent disorder.\nThe force said the two people stabbed during the disorder did not have life-threatening injuries. \nDet Insp Lisa Jones said: \u201cWe\u2019d like to thank our police colleagues in Leicestershire for their assistance during what was an extensive search of the country park for this suspect.\n\u201cSeveral different teams from both sides of the county border were involved, while aerial support was also provided by NPAS, so we\u2019re extremely grateful for this assistance.\"\nAnyone with information about the Wilford Street incident is asked to contact the police. \nMeanwhile, Leicestershire Police is investigating the full circumstances surrounding the dog\u2019s death.\nDet Insp Claire Hughes of Leicestershire Police said: \"Colleagues are supporting the dog\u2019s handler at this understandably difficult time and our investigation to establish what happened is ongoing.\"\nA police tribute described Zyla as a member of the force who \"will always be remembered for her bravery, her dedication and her service\".\nThe force's flag is being flown at half mast at its headquarters, and an event will also be arranged in Zyla's memory.\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A man wrongly convicted of murder 83 years ago has finally been brought home.\nHenry 'Harry' Gleeson was executed for the murder of Moll McCarthy, who was shot dead in County Tipperary in November 1940.\nHis family spent years trying to clear his name and, in 2015, Harry was the first recipient of a posthumous pardon from the Irish government.\nHis body was exhumed from the grounds of Mountjoy Prison in Dublin in January 2024 and returned to his family.  \nA government review of the case was carried out following pressure from justice campaigners and Mr Gleeson's family.\nIt found police and prosecutors withheld crucial evidence from the farm labourer's trial.\nMr Gleeson was convicted and executed \"as a result of a case based on unconvincing circumstantial evidence\", the review found.\nFor the family, it was \"amazing\".\nHarry's grand-nephew, Kevin Gleeson, told BBC News NI that it was a long, emotional, but powerful day.\n\"The feeling of the day\u2014the many people that worked on this to get Harry's name exonerated\u2014that day was brilliant.\n\"Harry was an innocent man; his life was taken,\" he added.\nThe person who murdered Moll McCarthy has never been brought to justice.\nKevin said having Harry's name cleared was a huge achievement, but it wasn't the final stage of his journey.\n\"We have a good, big family; there were people we did this for, and we knew it was time to get Harry home,\" he said.\nIt took eight years and many meetings with the Republic of Ireland's Department of Justice (DoJ) before the process of exhuming Harry's body began. \n\"We had little documentation, but there was a registration book at Mountjoy Prison; Harry's death record said where he was buried\u2014the rear of an old hospital within the prison,\" Kevin added.\nHe said the DoJ was \"willing to leave no stone unturned\".\nAn area on the grounds of Mountjoy Prison was excavated in January to recover the remains of 29 prisoners executed between 1923 and 1954.\nA huge amount of work went in to open the area of the prison, and there was a lot of anxiety over whether anything would be found.\n\"The real work was happening; we weren't naive; the remains could have been someone else; it was only 1000 square metres, but you had gas, water, and electric services through the decades; we were worried,\" said Kevin.\nBy March, about nine remains had been recovered, and the Gleeson family was told Harry could be one of them.\n\"The DNA process took some time, but we were ecstatic\u2014it was a weird, surreal time.\"\nAfter the remains of Harry Gleeson were confirmed via DNA processing, the family were ready to give Harry his final journey home.\nHarry's family set out on the journey to bring him to his hometown of Galbertstown in County Tipperary at the start of July. \n\"It was a very emotional day, to bring him out of the gates of Mountjoy Prison - 83 years ago he went into that prison and was dead within three months.\n\"They had a guard of honour, the silence was immense - prison guards and prisoners came out too - it was just amazing,\" said Harry's grand-nephew. \nHarry Gleeson's niece Kitty, at the age of 90, waited at Harry's family home to welcome her uncle back.\n\"Bringing Harry back to Kitty - the silence and the tears was unbelievable. She lived through the hurt - she was so proud and delighted - he was home,\" said Kevin. \nKevin added that people from far and wide across the island of Ireland came to Galberstown. \n\"The amount that travelled and paid their respects - it was a special moment. We had chats and music - Harry's own fiddle was played all weekend.\"\nA funeral was held at Holycross Abbey on 7 July and he was buried at St Mary\u2019s Cemetery, Holycross. \nIt all happened 83 years after he was executed by the Irish state. \n\"The burial was - well I just can't describe it - hundreds of people walked him up - it was a sad but happy time - just to have him home,\" Kevin added.\n\"To be able to visit his grave, after Harry was behind the walls of Mountjoy - it's been a long journey - but this is closure, it's closure to Harry's story.\"",
    "Almost all the papers carry pictures of Ollie Watkins celebrating his goal that secured England's place in the Euro 2024 final. \nLooking ahead to the clash with Spain, the Sun has nicknamed him \"Ol\u00e9 Watkins\". \nThe Daily Telegraph says the striker had been \"all but invisible\" during the tournament, but has now secured \"instant immortality\". \nIn its match report, the Daily Mirror calls Gareth Southgate a \"genius\" for making the decision to bring Watkins on as a substitute.\nA few of the papers say the England manager could soon be known as Sir Gareth. The Daily Express says he's \"almost certain\" to receive a knighthood if England wins the Euros. \nUnder the headline \"Honour me head son\", the Daily Star says it has been told by sources that he's likely already done enough at the tournament to \"clinch him the gong\".\nSeveral papers lead on the killing of the wife and two daughters of the BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt in an alleged crossbow attack. \nThe Times alleges that the youngest victim had broken up with the suspected attacker. The Daily Mail says the ex-soldier was found following a \"20-hour manhunt\" in a cemetery.\nThe Guardian focuses on the dilemma facing Sir Keir Starmer about overcrowded prisons in England and Wales. \nThe paper points to Whitehall sources who say 20,000 inmates could be freed as part of a new early release scheme. \nThe president of the Prison Governors Association, Tom Wheatley, is quoted as saying his union is \"hopeful the penal populism of the last government is a thing of the past,\" and that Labour would invest more in the service.\nThe Times says the new government is to \"make a major pitch to companies to recruit former prisoners\". It says the prisons minister, Lord Timpson - whose business has employed thousands of ex-offenders - wants to \"significantly boost\" the number of firms hiring them. \nThe paper says research by the Ministry of Justice shows prisoners who gain employment are less likely to re-offend.\nThe i says ministers are to force water companies to refund customer bills if they fail to tackle sewage spills. \nThe paper says the new environment secretary has said firms will no longer be allowed to use infrastructure funding to pay for bumper bonuses, dividends and salary increases. \nThe Financial Times says the government is drawing up plans to put failing water companies into \"special measures\".\nA few of the papers say that the former Conservative MP Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg is to become a reality TV star, after losing his seat at the election. \nThe Guardian says the show called Meet The Rees-Moggs will be available on the streaming platform Discovery+ this year. \nThe Telegraph says it will follow Sir Jacob and his family in the run up to the election.

    "A woman with a chronic illness who uses a stoma bag said she felt she could not \"drink or move\" during a Taylor Swift concert after members of the crowd criticised and \"shoved\" her for doing so while she was there.\nJournalist and content creator Holly Fleet, 30, who has ulcerative colitis and is known online as StomaBabe, said in a post on X she was \"treated with contempt\" whenever she went back to her spot in the crowd at the London show despite explaining she had a medical condition, and was \"continuously shoved\" by a parent for refusing to remove a backpack containing medical supplies.\nShe also said Wembley Stadium failed to provide advice to her before the event about bringing in medical supplies and drinks, and did not have enough accessible toilets available during the concert.\nA stadium spokesperson said they were sorry to hear about Ms Fleet's experience, adding Wembley was \"committed to providing an inclusive experience for all disabled guests\".\nMs Fleet, from north London, said she bought a VIP standing ticket for the 22 June gig because she did not think a disabled seated ticket would be available due to how popular Taylor Swift is.\nShe told BBC London she needed to empty her stoma bag regularly, and to drink often because the operation she had had meant she was susceptible to dehydration. \nShe said at previous gigs it had not been so hard \"to get in and out\" and she \"didn't think people would take too much offence to it\" - especially given that Swift's set would be several hours long.\nHowever, Ms Fleet said when she went to get drinks and brought them back \"I must have had about four different people have a go at me about that\".\nShe also said she was shoved repeatedly by two women in front of their children because she had a backpack on containing her medical supplies.\n\"I had my backpack on. One of them taps me on the back and was like, 'can you take that off please?' and I said: 'No, it's got medical supplies in so I can't take it off'... The next thing you know, she was just shoving me... really pushing me. And these were two mums who were both with their teen daughters.\"\nMs Fleet claimed when she turned around to ask what the problem was, the woman laughed at her and then carried on shoving her, making her feel \"really upset\".\n\"I had to move behind them because I couldn't put up with being shoved like that,\" she said.\n\"I felt like from every angle - I can't have a drink, I can't have my backpack on, I can't go to the toilets. Everything felt so awful,\" she said.\n\"I felt like I couldn't drink, I couldn't move.\"\nMs Fleet, who also has ADHD, said she eventually \"felt so overwhelmed by the whole thing that I literally ended up just phasing out\".\nShe said although she kept a hidden disabilities sunflower lanyard on as she was going to and from the toilet, a woman had an issue with her returning to her position with her friend, telling Ms Fleet \"we've been here for hours\" and accusing her of being \"disgraceful\".\n\"I did get a bit depressed when I got home, I did cry and stuff because I thought, 'is this how it's always gonna be for me now, am I always gonna experience this?' I might not be able to go to concerts again now.\"\nMs Fleet also complained there was a lack of information on the Wembley website about whether bags containing medical supplies and liquids would be allowed into the stadium, such as the rehydration drinks she needs after her operation.\nShe said that despite contacting Wembley's accessibility team with questions she never received a response. A spokesperson for the stadium said that Ms Fleet was sent automatic reply via email linking to the website's FAQs section, which asked people to get back in touch if their query was not answered - which she did not do.\nMs Fleet also said there was \"one disabled toilet near my section and the queue for that was insane\", with people without special keys to access the disabled toilets \"holding the door open\" for each other and people banging on the door shouting at her to hurry up.\nShe is encouraging people to have more respect for each other at concerts, and is asking venues like Wembley to offer better communication for people with additional needs or disabilities, including how long queues outside are likely to be and to provide contact phone numbers rather than just an email address.\nA spokesperson for Wembley Stadium said: \u201cWe would urge all our guests who might require specialist help or assistance, to contact our customer engagement team who are fully trained in disability awareness and have undertaken specific training to support all of our guests.\n\u201cWembley Stadium is committed to providing an inclusive experience for all disabled guests, regardless of whether their disability is visible or non-visible.\"\nThey added that the stadium had three Changing Places facilities and 147 accessible toilets and had been adapted to make it \"accessible to all\".\n\u201cWe pride ourselves on being an inclusive stadium,\" the spokesperson added.\n\u201cWe also work w",
    "Repairs to damage caused by extreme weather in Lincolnshire over the past year will cost \u00a345m, the Environment Agency (EA) has said.\nHundreds of homes were flooded during Storm Babet, last October, and Storm Henk, in January.\nA spokesperson for the EA said it had allocated \u00a316m from its capital budget for repairs and believed that this would allow 23 projects to be completed by March next year.\nHowever, when asked by the BBC about a timescale for the remaining repairs, the EA said it was unable to provide one while discussions were ongoing.\nFiskerton, near Lincoln, was among the communities badly affected by flooding during Storm Babet. \nResidents were told to evacuate their homes after the banks of the River Witham were breached. Further damage was caused in February this year.\nQuestions were raised about repairs to the bank during a meeting of Lincolnshire County Council's Flood and Water Management Scrutiny Committee, on 24 June, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nCouncillor Ian Fleetwood said he had been told that the damage would be fixed by Christmas. However, the EA was unable to confirm this.\nA spokesperson for the agency said: \u201cWe are currently working with our framework contractors to develop the plan for repairing the asset in Fiskerton. Once we have a timescale, we will communicate with relevant stakeholders.\n\u201cIn the meantime, we are continuing localised monitoring to ensure we can detect any increase in risk early and will work with partners to take action accordingly.\u201d\nCouncillor Colin Davie, the council's portfolio holder for economic development, environment and planning, has called on the new government to urgently address flooding.\nHe said a much greater focus needed to be placed on \"strategic investment\" around flood management.\n\u201cIt is no longer acceptable that we can spend tens of billions of pounds investing in green technologies if we don\u2019t address the outcomes of weather impacts and climate change that are happening today,\" he added.\nA spokesperson for the EA said it did not have regional investment targets and all schemes were \"carefully assessed to make sure they benefit the most people and property\".\nInvestment in flood risk management schemes \"takes place where the risk is highest, wherever it is across the country\", the spokesperson added.\nThe BBC has asked the EA to provide details of the 23 repair projects earmarked to be completed by March next year.\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

    "Power supply is a matter of life and death for Tetiana's son. \nHe was born with disabilities, and needs electricity-powered equipment to be able to breathe, to eat, and to receive medication.\n\"We are very dependent on electricity. If it wasn't for this bloody war, life would be difficult, but we'd be able to cope,\u201d Tetiana tells the BBC.\nUkrainians are learning to live with extended blackouts as Russia continues to pummel its energy facilities across the country.\nPersistent Russian air strikes mean even previously unaffected parts of Ukraine have to go without electricity for hours on end, practically every day.\nTetiana, who lives in the southern port city of Odesa, says that the endless power cuts make life extremely difficult because she needs to make sure the supply of electricity is constant. \nShe has a generator which runs on petrol and needs to be topped up all the time, but it has to be stopped every six hours to cool down.\nPower cuts also affect mobile phone coverage, so getting through to the ambulance service for her son can be a struggle too.\n\"Sometimes it takes half an hour, sometimes it's an hour before the ambulance arrives when my child goes into convulsions and turns blue,\u201d she says. \u201cMy son can die if he doesn't get oxygen. I'm lost for words.\u201d\nRecent blackouts have lasted as long as 12 hours a day in Tetiana's neighbourhood.\nFor millions of Ukrainians, the absence of power can mean no running water, air conditioning, lifts or access to life-saving equipment.\nOver the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says. This is more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before the full-scale invasion in February 2022. It is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption \u2013 or Slovakia, Lavtia, Lithuania and Estonia combined, Ukrenergo says.\n\"All state-owned thermal power plants are destroyed. All hydropower plants in our country are damaged by Russian missiles or drones,\" Ukrenergo spokeswoman Maria Tsaturian tells the BBC.\nThe lack of generated electricity is made worse by rising temperatures in the summer, when Ukrainians turn on power-hungry air conditioning systems.\nTo cope with the shortfall, Ukrenergo has had to implement a policy of sweeping power cuts across the country, which last for many hours a day every day.\nAs a result, millions of Ukrainians have become increasingly reliant on fuel-powered generators or big power banks.\nThe Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has been experiencing lengthy power cuts.\nRoksolana was elected by residents of her 24-storey apartment block to help run the building's facilities.\nShe says living in tower blocks is not easy because power cuts also mean no running water on the upper floors.\n\u201cThe lifts are not working either, so mothers with children and disabled people have to wait. They plan their trips outside depending on when there is electricity,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey've got to stay indoors for six hours on end, our elderly ladies can't pop out to the shops to get their bread.\"\nSuch residents in tall buildings are stuck inside their sweltering apartments because air conditioning isn't working. \nThey are also more exposed to Russian air strikes because they are unable to go to the safety of the bomb shelters, which are typically located underground.\nIn Zaporizhzhia, dentist Volodymyr Stefaniv says appointments have to be rescheduled at the last moment, and there've been occasions when electricity disappeared during complicated surgery.\n\"If this happens, we start our generators so we can finish what we have started. There's no other way - we can't tell the patient to come back tomorrow,\" he says. \"Literally a couple of weeks ago power cuts became particularly frequent. Of course they're very disruptive.\"\nTo perform urgent or less complicated operations during blackouts, Mr Stefaniv uses a head torch. This is a skill he acquired and perfected while treating soldiers on the front line, and his firm still provides free or heavily discounted services for members of the Ukrainian army.\n\"I can treat toothache or swelling without electricity. We've learnt to perform surgery without electricity,\" he says.\nMaria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo is aware that a lot of anger is directed at her company for cutting electricity so often, for so long and for so many customers. But, she says, there's no other option.\n\"We are at war. The energy sector is one of the goals for the Russian terrorists. And it's obvious why: all our life, all our civilization, is built on electricity. You just have to destroy your enemy's power grid, and they will have no economy, and they will have no life,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThis is the price we pay for freedom.\"",
    "Two brothers who launched a \"brutal\" attack on a stranger on the street have been jailed after their initial sentence was deemed too lenient.\nKenneth Brown, 27, and Shaun Brown, 25, had initially been spared jail for the attack in Carlisle city centre, which left their victim with a broken hand, fractured nose and black eyes.\nIn his sentencing remarks at the initial hearing in April at Carlisle Crown Court, Recorder Julian Shaw said he was suspending the two year sentence for both men in light of their \"genuine remorse\" and because the country's prisons were full.\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it could not comment fully due to the upcoming general election, but it said sentencing decisions remained \"a matter for the independent judiciary\".\nThe initial sentence was increased, following a hearing on Thursday, to three and a half years immediate jail for attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm.\nThe fresh sentence comes after the case was referred by the solicitor general to the Unduly Lenient Sentences scheme.\nThe scheme allows anyone to ask for certain crown court sentences to be reviewed by the Attorney General's Office if they think the sentence is too lenient.\nAt the time of the initial sentencing hearing at Carlisle Crown Court, the judge heard the attack had been carried out on Lowther Street in the early hours of 30 October 2022.\nThe Brown brothers, both of Winmoss Drive, Liverpool, had travelled with their father, a former soldier, to attend an annual reunion for Kings Own Royal Border Regiment (KORBR) veterans.\nBut at about 02:00 GMT, they encountered a complete stranger in the street while chanting their allegiance to Liverpool Football Club. \nHe spoke of being a Manchester United fan and was then attacked by the pair with punches, kicks and stamps over the course of several minutes.\nThe young victim was treated in hospital that night and discharged. In an impact statement, he spoke of his career as a plasterer probably being over after cancelling an apprenticeship due to the hand injury.\nDuring the initial sentence, the judge acknowledged the seriousness of the attack.\n\"It was a cowardly, brutal, sustained attack on a drunk and, ultimately, utterly defenceless young man,\" he said. \nBut after hearing mitigation, he concluded the violence was out of character for the defendants, who had no previous convictions. \nSpeaking on the appeal Det Con Nick Mandale said: \"We welcome the revised sentences.\n\"Kenneth and Shaun subjected the victim to a brutal attack and now will be reflecting on their actions in prison.\n\"Such an attack could have killed the victim but luckily, he did not sustain more serious life-changing injuries.\"\nThe MoJ said prison population had grown \"significantly\" due to the impacts of the pandemic on the courts, and short-term measures had been implemented to increase capacity.\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Western leaders have rallied round Joe Biden at the Nato summit, amid concerns about the US president's age and ability to serve another term.\nCalls are growing for Mr Biden to drop out of the presidential race this November, and his attempts to diminish fears about his re-election bid at the summit were marred by two serious gaffes.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Mr Biden was \"in charge\" and \"clear on the issues he knows well\", while UK PM Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"on good form\".\nBut Mr Biden's first gaffe, in which he introduced Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin, was ridiculed in the Russian media.\n\nAnd later in a news conference - Mr Biden's first unscripted public appearance since the debate - he referred to his \"Vice-President Trump\" when meaning to say Kamala Harris.\nThe US president has been under pressure to quit since a disastrous performance two weeks ago in a debate with his Republican rival in the upcoming elections, Donald Trump.\nBut throughout the summit, other Nato leaders have defended him and his ability to lead. \nMr Macron, speaking after Thursday's White House dinner, said he had had a long discussion with Mr Biden during the meal, and appealed for understanding of his flaws.\n\"I saw him as always a president who is in charge, clear on the issues he knows well,\" he said.\n\"We all make slips of the tongue sometimes.

    "Pub bosses have come under fire after saying they did not want \"children running about annoying other diners\", \"getting into mischief\" or \"using the table as a drum\".\nManagers at The Chequers, in The Street, Eriswell, Suffolk, made the comments - which did not go down well with families - in a post on social media that has since been deleted.\nIn the statement, landlords said the pub was \"not child friendly\" as it did not have a children's menu, play area, child-safe exterior or baby changing facilities.\nThe Chequers has now reaffirmed it welcomed \"well-behaved children\" and said it was forced to post the guidance after \"one too many incidents\".\nThe post proved controversial among pub-going families in the area, prompting some to consider cancelling reservations.\nJade Hawkins, 27, who lives nearby and has two children, including a disabled daughter, said her \"biggest gripe\" with the post was how it had been \"disgustingly worded\", adding it was \"aggressive and rude\".\n\"Quite frankly I believe it will impact their business because every parent will have to decide if they think their child would fit the description of being 'well-behaved' enough for their establishment,\" she said.\n\"As a parent myself I agree it would be lovely to have somewhere to go without small children but they have drawn attention to themselves and not in a good way.\n\"Who are they to say what children are good enough and what children aren't? Children are children at the end of the day.\"\nOthers, meanwhile, said they agreed with the landlords' stance, saying \"a pub should be a place for adults to unwind and enjoy\".\nThe uproar comes after landlord David Worcester, who runs the Lower Red Lion in St Albans, Hertfordshire,  caused a row in April after he put out a chalkboard saying: \"Dog friendly, child free\".\nThe Chequers refused to comment officially when contacted by the BBC but told  followers on social media the decision had been made after \"one too many incidents\" and reiterated it welcomed \"well-behaved\" children. \nThe original statement had said if children did not require any facilities \"they are most welcome\". \nIt went on: \"[But if they do] please take the children to an establishment which does accommodate children.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A Scottish schoolgirl with a rare genetic disorder is heading to America to help with research into her condition.\nTwelve-year-old Hannah Gould from South Queensferry was diagnosed with ASXL3 at the age of four, and as a result, lives with a range of physical, emotional and learning disabilities.\nHannah and her mum Lesley will attend the world's largest ASXL conference in Baltimore later this month to learn more about the condition, participate in research and celebrate with others who have the disabling disorders.\n''I was very sick and I was almost dying a little bit,\" Hannah told BBC Scotland News about her condition.\nDespite her challenges, Hannah has never let it stop her enjoying life.\n''I love being special and it's so much fun,\" she said.\n''I like to do some singing, some dancing, some musical theatre.\n''My favourite bands are One Direction and Taylor Swift.''\nMum Lesley said the realisation that something was wrong came early on.\n''When Hannah was a very small baby it was very hard to get her to gain weight,\" she said.\n''We were admitted into the hospital and she was very unwell. It was just terrifying.''\nShe said the first year they spent in hospital almost consistently. Hannah was fed through a tube.\n\"It was a lot, especially because they were trying to find out what was wrong.\n''Nobody knew.''\nLesley said that Hannah was one of about 100 people in the world to be diagnosed with the gene mutation ASXL3 and she did as much research as possible to learn more.\nShe said: \"I tried to read up about it and it can have challenging behaviour, affects sleep, affects her mobility, she doesn't walk steadily or for very long, her speech is delayed.\n''She's very lucky because out of a lot of the children with her condition, there's only very few of them that have speech.''\nHannah's mum said having a child with an extremely rare genetic condition was hard, because most people know nothing about it.\n''You don't really know if what you're doing is correct,\" she said. \"But it's been 100% worth it because she is absolutely fantastic.''\nThe mother and daughter are both looking forward to finding out more about the condition from experts in the US.\nLesley is keen to find out as much as she can about how it will continue to affect Hannah.\nExperts at the Baltimore conference will encourage dialogue between science and medicine specialists across the world and with patients and families.\nDr Emily Woods, of Sheffield University and Sheffield Children's Hospital, who has previously worked with Hannah on research, will present a paper on her one-year study of 50 families with ASXL3 disorders across the world.\nLesley is keen to have Hannah involved in future research studies.\nShe said: \"Anything we can do to help them further their knowledge and understanding of the ASXL3 condition is going to be amazing and getting to know the other families and find out their experiences and challenges as well.''\nThe conference will include workshops on sufferers' behaviour, and in particular, Lesley and Hannah want help with sleep. A big issue in Hannah's life is her struggle to sleep.\nShe said: \"I have really bad dreams.''\nLesley hopes the ASXL conference in Baltimore will bring a range of opportunities for patients and families to share experiences and for researchers to share advances.\n''I'd like there to be more research into what medicine Hannah could take or what strategies we could use with her to help her with her impulse control,\" she said.\n''I think she'd have more life opportunities if we could get those things under control so I'm not adverse to her taking some medication if there's something out there but at the moment they don't know.''\nHannah has dreams of helping others when she is older: \"I want to help sick ladies and sick babies if they have a really bad condition and I am going to be a nurse, a midwife.''\nHannah's been preparing for her trip by watching the movie \"Hairspray\" and sings \n''Good Morning Baltimore''. \nShe said: \"It's going to be amazing\".\nASXL3-related disorder, sometimes known as Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome, was first identified as a distinct neurodevelopmental disorder in 2013. \nIt is characterised by developmental delay or intellectual disability, with speech and language delay and/or absent speech.\nAffected individuals may also display autistic features.

It said it had found evidence of \"malicious actors\" abusing the system.\nThe investigation began under the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA). \nIt could lead to X being fined up to 6% of its global annual turnover and being forced to change how it operates in the bloc. \nMr Musk reacted angrily: \"The DSA is misinformation,\" he wrote on X.\nThe billionaire, who bought the platform for $44bn in 2022, said the DSA rules amounted to \"censored speech\" which he said he found unacceptable.\nX chief executive Linda Yaccarino also defended the company's practices. \n\"A democratised system, allowing everyone across Europe to access verification, is better than just the privileged few being verified,\" she wrote on the social media site. \nThe findings follow a seven month investigation under the DSA. \nThe law, which was introduced in 2022, requires big tech firms, like X, to take action to stop illegal content and safeguard the public.\nByteDance's TikTok, AliExpress and Meta Platforms are also being investigated under the act.\nThe Commission said its review of X had found a lack of transparency around advertising and that X did not provide data for research use as required under EU rules.\n\"In particular, X prohibits eligible researchers from independently accessing its public data, such as by scraping, as stated in its terms of service\", the Commission said.\nThe tech regulator also said that the way X designed and operated its interface for blue tick verified accounts did \"not correspond to industry practice and deceives users\".\n\"Since anyone can subscribe to obtain such a 'verified' status, it negatively affects users' ability to make free and informed decisions about the authenticity of the accounts and the content they interact with,\" it said.\n\"There is evidence of motivated malicious actors abusing the 'verified account' to deceive users,\" it added.\nThe Commission said X could defend itself against the findings or resolve the issue by committing to changes that would bring it into compliance. \nAny such deal would be made public, it added, in response to Mr Musk's claim that the commission had offered an \"illegal secret deal\". \n\"Back in the day, BlueChecks used to mean trustworthy sources of information,\" Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market, said.\n\"Now with X, our preliminary view is that they deceive users and infringe the DSA.\" \n\"X has now the right of defence - but if our view is confirmed, we will impose fines and require significant changes.\"\nThe Commission pushed back against Mr Musks's charge of censorship, saying its rules were aimed at ensuring \"a safe and fair online environment for European citizens that is respectful of their rights, in particular freedom of expression\".\nAmong its rules, it said, are requirements that companies inform users when their accounts are restricted and that users who are banned can contest those decisions. \nThe Commission said it was continuing investigations into X's practices around dissemination of illegal content, and how well it combats the spread of fake news.",
    "A speeding drink-driver who killed a woman and her baby nephew should never be allowed to drive again, the victims' family have said.\nDarryl Anderson, 38, was jailed for more than 17 years for causing the deaths by dangerous driving of Karlene Warner, 30, and her eight-month-old nephew Zackary Blades.\nThe pair were killed on the A1(M) in County Durham when Anderson, from Rotherham, was taking a picture of himself driving at more than 140mph.\nShalorna Warner, Zackary's mother and Ms Warner's sister, who was driving the car Anderson hit, said she would \"fight every day\" for justice in their memory.\nAnderson was almost three times the drink-drive limit when he drove his Audi Q5 from Newcastle Airport towards his home in Thorpe Hesley, in the early hours of 31 May.\nShalorna Warner had taken her sleeping son with her to pick up her sister from the airport, who had returned early from a holiday to start her dream job as a flight attendant.\nAt 03:17 BST, about 40 minutes after leaving the airport, Anderson smashed into Ms Warner's Peugeot about four miles (6km) south of Chester-le-Street.\nThe crash killed Zackary, who was asleep in the back seat, and front seat passenger Karlene Warner instantly.\nJailing him at Durham Crown Court on Tuesday, Judge Joanne Kidd said the crash was \"inevitable\" because of the way Anderson was driving.\nThe court also heard he had previous convictions for drink-driving and had been warned about the manner of his driving by police in Sheffield a week before the fatal crash.\nHe was banned from driving for 21 and a half years and must take an extended test before being allowed his licence back.\nBut the family of Zackary and Ms Warner said that was not enough.\nSpeaking outside court, Shalorna Warner said: \"We were never going to be happy with our sentence because it doesn't make up for what we have lost.\n\"The one thing I had really hoped for was a lifetime driving ban which he didn't get.\n\"Now I'm going to fight because he should never get in a car again and drive.\"\nShe said the family have set up an online campaign, called Justice for Zackary Blades and Karlene Warner, which would fight to stop dangerous drivers.\n\"No-one should have to go through what we've gone through and if we can stop that next person, make them think twice, then we have done some good,\" Ms Warner said.\n\"We will not stop, I will fight every single day I am on this earth for [Zackary and Karlene Warner],\" she added.\nDet Con Natalie Horner said Zackary and Ms Warner had been \"violently\" killed.\nShe said Anderson \"chose\" to drive the way he did and the car he hit \"didn't stand a chance\".\nWhile he would spend a \"considerable amount of time\" in prison, his victims had been \"handed life sentences\", Ms Horner said. \n\"We see the trauma dangerous drivers have on our families,\" she said, adding the force would be \"robust\" in prosecuting bad drivers and educating them to reduce road deaths.\nMs Horner also said the family of the victims had shown \"truly unbelievable strength and humility under the most horrific circumstances\".\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Global trade \u201cis not having the best of times at the moment\u201d.\nThat is the admission of the director general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. \u201cWe are seeing increasing protectionism, some undermining of the WTO rules, and some of this is leading to fragmentation,\u201d she tells the BBC.\n\u201cGlobal trade is really part of the lifeblood for making countries resilient - and also for underpinning growth, so we are concerned about that.\u201d\nIn recent weeks and months these fragmentations have come to the fore with the EU imposing provisional tariffs of up to 37.4% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). It followed after the US in May introduced 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs.\nBoth Brussels and Washington accuse the Chinese government of unfairly subsidising its EV sector, allowing producers to export cars at unfairly low prices, and threatening jobs in the West.\nPresident Biden has also increased import taxes on a range of other Chinese products that he said formed \"the industries of the future\". These include EV batteries and the minerals they contain, the cells needed to make solar panels, and computer chips.\nMeanwhile, the US has been pouring billions of dollars of government money into green technology, through its Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce a reliance on Chinese imports.\nEU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis tells the BBC that Europe does not want to close the market for EVs. \u201cWe welcome imports, we welcome competition, but this competition must be fair,\u201d he says.\nLast year, the volume of global trade fell for just the third time in 30 years, according to the WTO. It says the 1.2% decline was linked to higher inflation and interest rates, and is forecasting a recovery this year.\nHowever those factors have their roots in events that are continuing to fundamentally reshape the global economy,  the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF\u2019s) first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath explained in a recent speech.\n\u201cWhat we've seen in the last few years, I would say, especially when it comes to global trade relations, is nothing like we've seen since the end of the Cold War.\" \n\u201cThe last few years, you've had numerous shocks, including the pandemic. We had Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and following these events, increasingly, countries around the world are guided by economic security, and national security concerns, in determining who they trade with and who they invest in,\u201d she said.\nThat\u2019s affecting countries as far apart as Peru, Ghana and Vietnam as they increasingly find themselves having to choose between strengthening economic ties with the western powers, or a China-Russia axis.\n\u201cWe're also concerned about the emerging fragmentation that we see in the trade data,\u201d says the WTO\u2019s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. \u201cWe're seeing that trade between like-minded blocks is growing faster than trade across such blocks.\u201d\nShe warns that \u201cit will be costly for the world\u201d to continue down this path. WTO research has estimated that price at 5% of the global economy, whilst the IMF has suggested it could be nearer to 7% or $7.4tn (\u00a35.8tn) of lost output in the long run.\nThe EU\u2019s introduction of tariffs on Chinese-made EVs follows a surge in their exports to Europe over the last few years. Exports jumped from $1.6bn in value in 2020 to $11.5bn last year, according to one study, which said they now made up 37% of all EV imports into the EU.\nBYD, Geely and SAIC are some of the Chinese EV makers said to have benefitted from billions of dollars worth of government help.\nAfter many years of support Chinese EV companies no longer need that help, says Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. \u201cThey are today simply very competitive on their own terms. I think the introduction of tariffs is a symptom that something is out of balance.\u201d\nWhen it comes to broader relationship, Mr Eskelund says it\u2019s \u201cmind boggling\u201d that since 2017 the volume of goods that the EU has sold to China has fallen about a third, even though China\u2019s economy has been growing steadily.\nCiting Chinese restrictions around market access for overseas firms, and tough security regulations, he adds: \u201cI think it's fair to say that that Europe still remains a significantly more open market to Chinese companies, then the other way around. And that is obviously something that needs to change.\u201d\nThe chamber\u2019s recent survey showed that members have the lowest confidence on record for investing in China.\nIt comes as the EU is trying to lower its economic dependence on China. European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen last year described the need to \u201cde-risk not de-couple\u201d its relations with China.\nBrussels' concerns include Beijing using sensitive technology for military purposes, and its support for Russia as it continues its offensive in Ukraine.\nCompanies including Ikea, Nike and Apple are also trying to become less reliant on China.\nWhilst the EU and China are set to hold talks about the potential E",

    "With cream-coloured fur and jet-black eyes, one of the smallest specimens of America\u2019s largest native animal stumbled into the spotlight on shaky legs.\nAdvocates hope the June birth of a white buffalo calf  - an exceedingly rare event - will translate into new momentum for a decades-long push to revive the species in America's Great Plains.\nMany tribes consider a white bison birth to be a sacred omen that signifies change. The herd this calf was born into has also become an important cultural symbol - it's the last wild buffalo herd in North America. \nThe herd is entering a new chapter of its life as stewardship of the species is increasingly being overseen by indigenous communities again and advocates push to grow bison populations.\nThe American buffalo, also known as bison, once numbered in the tens of millions before being brought to the brink of extinction in the 1800s. Now, the only wild herd in the US is limited to just 5,000 animals. \nBut tribes and bison advocates see opportunity as Yellowstone, America\u2019s first national park and the home of the white calf, considers a proposal to expand the wild herd\u2019s size for the first time in decades. \nThe white calf has added spiritual significance to buffalo advocates' efforts as they test a long-standing status quo where government policies prioritise beef ranching over the beliefs of native tribes. \nJust after noon on 4 June, Yellowstone photography guide Jordan Creech was sightseeing with clients when he spotted the freshly-born white buffalo calf, taking its first steps in the park\u2019s Lamar Valley.\nBison calves can walk within two minutes of being born, and run alongside their herd within the first seven minutes of life.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most unique experience I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Creech says.\nErin Braaten, a photographer of Native American descent from Kalispell, Montana, also witnessed the calf\u2019s first moments of life before it disappeared into the herd.\n\"I thought I'd have a better chance of capturing Bigfoot than a white bison calf,\" she tells BBC News.\nFor the last 2,000 years the people of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakoda tribes have told the story of a woman who arrived during a time of need.\nA version speaks of two scouts searching for food and buffalo in the Black Hills of South Dakota.\nThe mysterious woman appeared and offered their tribe a bundle of sacred gifts, including a pipe carved from red rock, and instructed the people on how to live and pray.\nShe transformed several times before taking the form a white buffalo calf with a black nose, black eyes and black hooves. As she departed, a great number of buffalo returned to feed the people.\nDozens of other tribes have white buffalo stories, interpreting its arrival as both a blessing and a warning.\nChief Arvol Looking Horse, a spiritual leader of the Lakota Tribe, is known as the Keeper of the Sacred Bundle \u2014 the bundle and pipe left by the spirit. He likens the white calf\u2019s return to the second coming of Christ.\nLooking Horse, 70, said that before she departed, the woman told the people that she would return as a white buffalo calf \u201cwhen everything is sickly and not good, and when people are with a not good mind\u201d.\n\u201cThis is spirit. It means spirit is happening,\u201d he added.\nOn 26 June, more than 500 supporters formally celebrated the white calf at an event in West Yellowstone, just outside the park. Nearly a dozen tribes were represented. \nTogether, they heard the name bestowed upon the calf - Wakan Gli, meaning Sacred Returns or Comes Holy in the Lakota language. An altar of three buffalo skulls and three buffalo robes marked the occasion.\nWaemaetekosew Waupekenay, 38, who travelled from Wisconsin to attend on behalf of the Menominee Tribe, said the birth of the sacred calf has been a spiritual awakening.\nIts arrival, he says with amazement, shows that \u201cthere's a lot of healing, a lot of love going around. People are being united.\u201d\nNational Park rangers at Yellowstone have confirmed the white bison's birth, but rangers have not reported any sightings themselves.\n\u201cThe birth of a white bison calf in the wild is a landmark event in the ecocultural recovery of bison by the National Park Service,\u201d the park said in a statement on 28 June confirming it as the first white bison ever seen inside Yellowstone.\nThey added that it \"may reflect the presence of a natural genetic legacy that was preserved in Yellowstone\u2019s bison, which has revealed itself because of the successful recovery of a wild bison population\".\n\"The National Park Services acknowledges the significance of a white bison calf for American Indians,\u201d it added.\nThe Yellowstone bison make up the only wild herd in the US and are among the last genetically pure bison in existence.\nBut Yellowstone National Park regularly reaches the legally-permitted capacity of 5,000. \nTribes who support the species' growth have stepped in, believing the species' health is tied to their own history. Since 2019, the US National Park Service has transferred 414 healthy bison from Ye",

    "Life comes at you fast.\nLast month, AI chip giant Nvidia briefly became the world\u2019s richest company, overtaking Microsoft, which had in turn risen above Apple.\nWhen this news was mentioned on stage at a tech industry event I attended in Copenhagen, there was spontaneous applause from the audience.\nAs I write, Nvidia is now back in second place, after a fall in its share price took its combined value down to $3tn (\u00a32.4tn) compared with $3.4tn for Microsoft.\nTwo things have propelled these two US tech titans to such a dizzying pinnacle: AI and foresight.\nMicrosoft started investing in OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019. Meanwhile, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang pushed his company towards AI chip development many years before generative AI exploded onto the scene.\nBoth firms took a long-term bet on the current AI boom \u2013 and so far, it\u2019s paid off, leaving former top-dog Apple trailing in their wake. But how long will it last?\nThis year\u2019s London Tech Week, an annual event for the UK tech scene, may as well have been called London AI Week. The letters AI were emblazoned on every stand, and uttered in every speech.\nI bumped into Anne Boden, the founder of Starling Bank, a significant fintech disruptor. She was buzzing with excitement.\n\u201cWe thought we knew who the winners and losers were [in tech],\u201d she told me. \u201cBut with AI, we are throwing the dice again\u201d.\nShe believes she\u2019s watching the AI revolution re-landscape the tech sector, and she wants to dive back in.\nThat same week I also popped along to Founders Forum, an annual gathering of around 250 high-level entrepreneurs and investors. Some serious money, in other words. It\u2019s a confidential event, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get into too much trouble for saying that much of the chat there was also centred around AI.\nA few days after that, a headline in the Financial Times caught my eye. \u201cMost stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,\u201d it read, claiming that more than half of the stocks in Citigroup\u2019s \u201cAI winners basket\u201d had fallen in value in 2024.\nLife comes at you fast indeed.\n\u201cGiven how high valuations have leapt for tech companies, missteps ahead could cause big wobbles in share prices,\u201d warns Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\u201cJust like the dot.com bubble, over-enthusiasm risks spilling over into disappointment.\u201d\nIn 2023 you\u2019d have been forgiven for thinking that anything with the acronym AI in it was guaranteed to open up a lucrative seam of funding, with investment dollars flooding into all things AI.\nMy friend Saurabh Dayal, who is based in Scotland, identifies AI projects for his pharmaceutical firm to potentially collaborate on. \nHe said he soon grew tired of misleading pitches.\n\u201cI spend a lot of time saying \u2018\u2026 but that\u2019s not AI\u2019,\u201d he tells me.\nIt seems both investors and clients are finally growing wiser to the term AI, and, as a result, more picky.\nSpeaking to the FT, Citi\u2019s Stuart Kaiser said that while AI remained a big theme in the world of stocks and shares, \u201cjust saying AI 15 times isn\u2019t going to cut it anymore\u201d.\nIn addition, there is increased awareness of current generative AI products not exactly living up to their own hype. Inaccuracies, misinformation, displays of bias, copyright infringements and some content that\u2019s just plain weird.\nAnd early AI-enabled physical devices like the Rabbit R1 and Humane Pin have received bad reviews.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the market around generative AI mature a little right now \u2013 early experiments set a lot of grand expectations, but when the rubber hit the road there were too many unexpected outcomes,\u201d says Chris Weston, chief digital and information officer of the tech service firm Jumar.\n\u201cBusinesses have a lot of value tied up in goodwill \u2013 the trust and comfort that their clients have in their services. Introducing ungovernable chatbots is a step too far for many right now.\u201d\nTech analyst Paolo Pescatore agrees that the pressure is on for AI firms to deliver on their promises. \u201cThe bubble will burst the moment one of the giants fails to show any meaningful growth from AI,\u201d he says.\nBut he does not believe that is going to happen any time soon.\n\u201cEveryone is still jostling for position, and all companies are pinning their strategies on AI,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cAll the players are ramping up their activities, increasing spend and claiming early successes.\u201d\nThere\u2019s another reason why the AI bubble might pop. It\u2019s got nothing to do with the quality of the products or their market value. It\u2019s whether the planet itself can afford it.\nA study published last year predicted that the AI industry could consume the same amount of energy of a country the size of the Netherlands by 2027 if growth continues at its current rate.\nI interviewed Prof Kate Crawford from the University of Southern California for the BBC\u2019s Tech Life podcast, and she told me that worrying about the amount of electricity, energy and water required to power AI kept her awake a",
    "Several papers lead on the Nato summit in Washington. \nThe Guardian says Sir Keir Starmer will urge other countries in the alliance to increase their defence spending to 2.5% of their economic output.\nAccording to the Times, the prime minister has been accused of \"playing with fire\", because he is delaying a decision to increase the UK's military budget until after a major review of the armed forces. \nThe paper says that could take months, and some former military leaders say investment in the forces can't wait, given the gravity of the threats facing the UK.\nThe Daily Telegraph says the review will consider an increase in the size of the armed forces. The paper says that will include troop numbers, which have been cut to their smallest size since the Napoleonic era. \nAccording to the article, the review will focus on the changing threats of warfare, including a focus on drones.\nSeparately, in an editorial, the Telegraph urges European Nato powers to start taking greater responsibility for their own security, and increase defence spending. \nThe paper says, despite the war in Ukraine, Sir Keir has yet to say when the military budget will reach 2.5% cent of the economic output, and the German government has approved an increase in defence spending amounting to just a fifth of what the country's defence minister said was necessary.\nAccording to the i, the national security adviser, Sir Tim Barrow, has been told that he will not be Britain's next ambassador to Washington, even though he was appointed in the final weeks of Rishi Sunak's administration. \nThe paper says the prime minister is now expected to make a political appointment to the job, and the frontrunners are the former Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, and the former Business Secretary, Lord Mandelson.\nIn an editorial, the Daily Express criticises Labour's decision to scrap the Conservatives' plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. The paper says Sir Keir and his friends have axed a vital deterrent. \nThe shadow home secretary, James Cleverly, tells the paper the new government has in effect hung an \"open\" sign on the white cliffs of Dover.\nA report in the Daily Mail says Royal Mail will no longer use trains to transport post, after nearly two centuries of doing so. \nThe postal service will tell its staff today that it is planning to sell its freight trains and increase deliveries by road. The paper says the decision represents a major U-turn - coming just a year after Royal Mail opened its super hub at Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal.\nAnd \"how's the nerves?\", asks the Daily Star as it leads on tonight's Euro 2024 semi-final between England and the Netherlands. \n\"Let's make history\", is the rallying cry from the England manager, Gareth Southgate, in the Daily Express. \nThe Daily Mirror reports the Three Lions have the backing of pub landlords in Germany - in the hope a victory will keep England fans boozing.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "The US has announced new rules targeting firms from China and other countries that are routing shipments of steel and aluminium through Mexico to try to evade tariffs.\nThe White House said firms shipping via Mexico must now prove the origins of their products if they want to avoid the border taxes.\nThe move comes as President Joe Biden seeks to prove his tough-on-China credentials as he faces off against his predecessor, Donald Trump, in the 2024 presidential election.\nThe measures expand protections for US steel and aluminium-makers that were launched under Mr Trump in 2018 in the name of national security.\nThe tariffs, which set a 25% tax on steel and 10% tax on aluminium imports, were controversial, sparking trade battles with countries around the world.\nMexico, one of America's largest trade partners, was among the countries to eventually win an exemption from the rules.\nThe White House said it decided to revisit the exemption for Mexico, as an increase in imports from the country suggested it was being used as a stopping point to bypass the taxes. \nOnly about 13% of the steel imported from Mexico last year - and only 6% of aluminium - originated from outside of North America, according to officials.\nBut officials said the rules were aimed at heading off a further increase, as China's flagging domestic economy leads firms to look abroad.\nCompanies shipping steel to the US must now prove it has been melted and poured in North America under the new rules, which were jointly announced with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez-Obrador. \nFor aluminium, firms must prove it has not been smelt in China, Russia, Belarus or Iran. \nThe head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing praised the new measures, calling them a \"step forward in countering China's predatory trade practices and making North American steel trade more fair\".\n\"This is the right call by the Biden administration,\" the group's president Scott Paul said in a statement. \n\"China and other nations must not be allowed to exploit trade with our neighbours in order to avoid US trade enforcement.\"\nBut others said the administration should have gone further to curb imports from Mexico.\n\"We need to reinstate tariffs on Mexican steel until their imports are back to sustainable levels,\" Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, wrote on social media.\nWhen he took office, President Joe Biden tried to ease trade tensions, replacing many of the Trump-era tariffs with other protections such as quotas for countries like the UK. \nBut he also kept in place or expanded other tariffs imposed by his predecessor, a sign of a major shift in American politics, once known for its promotion of free trade.\nParty leaders are responding to backlash against globalisation among voters, especially in key electoral battleground states such as Pennsylvania, formerly home to a large steel industry.\nBoth Mr Trump and Mr Biden have spotlighted their protections for the steel industry while courting voters in the state.\nIf elected, Mr Trump has vowed to go further than he did during his first term as president, proposing a 10% tariff on all imports, which would rise to 60% on goods from China.",
    "The next parole hearing for double child killer Colin Pitchfork will no longer be held in public due to \"unforeseeable developments, including fresh allegations\".\nPitchfork, 64, was jailed for life in 1988 after raping and strangling 15-year-old girls Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth in Leicestershire in 1983 and 1986.\nThe Parole Board said on Thursday the allegations were \"in respect of relatively recent conduct\".\nIt apologised for the \"increased stress\" on the families of the victims.\nPitchfork, then aged 27, became the first murderer to be convicted in the UK using DNA profiling and was handed a minimum jail term of 30 years, later reduced to 28 years.\nHe was initially released from prison in September 2021 but was back behind bars two months later after it was decided he had breached his parole conditions after Pitchfork disclosed he had approached a lone female.\nIn June last year, the Parole Board found the decision to recall Pitchfork to prison was flawed and said his detention was no longer necessary for public safety. \nBut this ruling was blocked by the justice secretary at that time, Alex Chalk, who called for the decision to release Pitchfork to be reviewed.\nAlthough Pitchfork lost his latest bid for freedom in December, earlier this year he successfully challenged the ruling to keep him behind bars.\nIt means the Pitchfork will face a fresh parole hearing, which could see him released from jail.\nA spokesperson for the Parole Board said: \"A panel of the Parole Board held a directions hearing for Colin Pitchfork on Wednesday 10 July.\n\"At that directions hearing the panel and both parties discussed how best to receive evidence in respect of fresh allegations in the case. This included the submission of new material to the panel which relates to risk.\n\"We regret that as a result of material changes in circumstances there has had to be a change of decision in relation to the nature of the hearing, which will no longer be held in public.\n\"It has been caused by unforeseeable developments including fresh allegations in respect of relatively recent conduct.\n\"A copy of the public hearing decision, made by the panel chair using their delegated authority, will be published on the Parole Board website, when available.\n\"We would like to apologise again for the increased stress that both the adjournment and the subsequent public hearing decision may have on the victims.\n\"Victim involvement is a valued part of the parole process and the victims have been invited to observe some of the private proceedings.\n\"The private oral hearing will be relisted in due course.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Instead of that famous view looking up at the Buckingham Palace balcony, visitors for the first time will be able to look down from the inside.\nAfter five years of renovations, the east wing of the palace has been carefully restored and on a trial basis is open to paying customers from next week.\nBut they won't be able to step out on to the balcony itself - and when you visit you can see why.\nIt's surprisingly narrow and the railings are below waist height, in a way that would send any health and safety officers into a royal panic.\nBut looking through the windows - and what royal author Robert Hardman has called \"the most famous net curtains in the world\" - you can see the view from the perspective of the King and Queen, Prince William and Catherine.\nWhat's surprising from this vantage point is how clearly you can see the crowds of tourists below, you can really see people's faces.\nThere's also the curiosity of the change of perspective - looking out across the pink gravel of the courtyard and towards the Mall, rather than the usual view from outside the gates looking in.\nTo get to the balcony the royals go through the Centre Room, elaborately decorated in a Chinese style, and now open to the public for the first time since this wing was built 175 years ago.\nA huge lamp fitting hangs down, decorated in the style of a lily, and the walls are covered in Chinese-themed art. \nThe royal world loves its acronyms. So Buckingham Palace is \"BP\" and Kensington Palace is \"KP\" - but this enthusiasm for Chinese and oriental art is connected to another BP.\nThat's the Brighton Pavilion, because building the east wing of Buckingham Palace was funded by Queen Victoria selling off the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.\nThat seaside retreat was a fusion of Asian styles and racy regency fashions and, always keen on recycling, the 19th Century royals removed the Chinese and Japanese-themed furniture and art and put it into Buckingham Palace.\nThat included the fixtures and fittings, such as doors, gilded curtain poles and a fireplace, as well as ornamental porcelain pagodas.\nThe introduction of tours to this previously private section of the palace is part of a broader ambition to make royal residences more open to the public.\nThe east wing, getting its first tourists, is the main facade of the palace, where tourists gather outside to watch Changing of the Guard - it's the view you see on the postcards.\nIt's not cheap to look round, costing \u00a375, but has already completely sold out for this year. And this summer's inaugural visitors will be in guided groups of 20, separate to the existing more general tour of the palace's state rooms.\nIn this more intimate version of the tour, none of the items on show are roped off from visitors. The furniture doesn't have 'keep off' signs.\nIt makes it feel more like a living building rather than a museum, but there's no escaping the gradual gift-shopification of the palace. \nIt's a mix of an historic setting for grand events, an office block and a tourist attraction, but at the moment it still seems a way off from being where any of the royals are likely to live.\nVisiting royals don't stay here either any more. During their recent state visit the Emperor and Empress of Japan stayed in Claridge's Hotel.\nThere is an ongoing \u00a3369m project to renovate the palace complex, not just the gilded surfaces, but the basics of the plumbing and wiring on what is a huge set of ageing buildings. Once you step away from the glitzy state rooms you never seem far from scaffolding and repair works.\nRenovating the east wing alone meant removing and conserving 3,500 separate items, including historic furniture and works of art. And the tour only includes only a relatively small part of that wing.\nBut the sell-out tours show the public demand and while there will be art lovers among the visitors, people will also be coming to see for themselves something they might have watched on television or imagined through the Crown.\nThey can stand in the elegant Yellow Drawing room, used for many audiences and the setting of a Christmas broadcast by the late Queen Elizabeth II.\nOr visitors can look out of the window at the quadrangle below, where Sir Keir Starmer pulled up last week when he went to meet the King after winning the general election.\nThere's plenty of royal bling on show in the long corridors, but it's the sense of seeing behind the scenes in the palace that will draw people.\nAnd when they look out through the long balcony windows, they might resist the temptation to give a little wave.",
    "\u201cVictory was stolen from them using dirty tricks,\u201d Corrine said as her children played in a playground in Eysines, a suburb of Bordeaux in France. \nShe couldn\u2019t hide her disappointment that the party she backs, the far-right Rassemblement National, came just third in Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections.\n\u201cWe were hoping for change and an RN government,\u201d her friend Sylvie added. \u201cNow we will have to put up with whatever comes next.\u201d\nUntil Sunday, this constituency was held by the RN\u2019s Gr\u00e9goire de Fournas. He became one of the previous parliament\u2019s most infamous members after shouting \"they should go back to Africa\" as a black colleague talked about a migrant rescue boat in 2022.\nBut Mr de Fournas was narrowly defeated by Pascale Got, a candidate of the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP), as part of a shock wave of successes for the alliance. \nAn emotional Mrs Got responded to the results by saying that the new parliament needed to \u201clisten to what the French people want\u201d and offer \u201cprogress and social justice\u201d.\nThough the RN made gains nationally, it came in third behind the NFP and President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, largely because of tactical withdrawals to concentrate the anti-far right vote.\nRN president Jordan Bardella, who had hoped to be prime minister if his party won the election, claimed that the far right only lost because almost every other party in French politics, ranging from Marxists to right-wing economic liberals, united against it.\nShortly after polls closed, he condemned what he called an \u201calliance of dishonour\u201d between the NFP and Ensemble, which both withdrew candidates in some contests to defeat the far right.\n\u201cAn unnatural alliance prevented the French people from freely choosing a different type of politics,\u201d he added.\nLuna Aim\u00e9, an RN activist, said: \u201cNine parties had to join together to beat one, which still increased its number of MPs.\u201d\nThe sense that the RN was prevented from winning by trickery resonated among its voters.\n\u201cI had a feeling that the RN would be blocked from winning. But I didn\u2019t expect this many losses,\u201d Sylvie said.\nCorrine said the party had suffered a \u201chuge defeat,\u201d even though it increased its number of MPs from 89 to 143, its best result in history. It is now only slightly smaller than the other two blocs.\nHer statement reflected the high expectations - played up by the RN before the vote - that it would be in a position to appoint a prime minister and govern France for the first time in the party\u2019s history.\nWith the results nonetheless showing a big advance for the RN across France, party leader Marine Le Pen said victory for her party had been \u201cmerely deferred\u201d.\nMr de Fournas thanked the 49% of voters in his constituency who had backed him and said: \u201cFixing the country will take a little longer than expected but it is certain that we will come to power one day.\u201d\nBut many in the constituency were relieved that Mr de Fournas and the RN more broadly had been held off, at least for the time being.\nOutside a cafe, Soufiane said France had always been and should remain a country where cultures mixed together.\nHe said: \"De Fournas is a racist. When you tell a person of colour to go back to Africa, that says everything.\n\"I\u2019m very happy that he lost.\u201d",
    "A former Boys' Brigade leader and youth football coach has been jailed for abusing seven boys in his care.\nCraig Menzies, 55, carried out the crimes at various locations across Scotland between 1986 and 2004.\nThis included sexually abusing boys while on trips, giving them alcohol and showing them pornography. He also carried out abuse during so-called \"fitness sessions\" with one victim.\nMenzies pleaded guilty to seven charges - four indecent assaults and three counts of indecent behaviour - at the High Court in Glasgow on 29 May.\nKatrina Parkes, Scotland's procurator fiscal for High Court sexual offending, said Menzies had used his position and community links to \"prey on vulnerable young boys who should have been safe in his care\".\nHe was given 12 years in jail with three years on licence and has been added to the sex offenders register for an indefinite period.\nThe ex-physiotherapist took advantage of his roles by abusing a young footballer while he was injured, having told the boy he would not play football again if he refused to be treated by him.\nJudge Tom Hughes said it was \"quite clear\" how badly the victims had been affected by Menzies.\nHe added:  \"In some cases, careers were ruined and others were involved in offending as they can't come to terms with what you did to them.\n\"I have taken account of that and it's quite inevitable I have considered that a lengthy custodial sentence is acceptable in this case.\"\nThe court heard that Menzies met four of the boys when he was a unit leader with the 118th Boys' Brigade Company, based in King's Park Parish Church in Glasgow.\nDuring a trip to a campsite in Leven, Fife, in the mid to late 80s, Menzies indecently assaulted one boy, aged 13 or 14.\nThe child was intoxicated and asleep when the abuse began.\nA second boy, aged around 12 or 13, was targeted during a camping trip at the West Highland Way, near Fort William, in the early to mid-90s.\nMenzies gave the boy alcohol and showed him pornographic magazines before sexually abusing him.\nHe then targeted a third boy, aged around 12 or 13, at a campsite in Glencoe in the early 90s.\nDuring an unofficial camping trip to the Isle of Skye, arranged by Menzies in the mid-90s, he indecently assaulted a fourth teenager.\nA number of Boys' Brigade members were on the trip alongside the victim, who was their friend.\nThe court also heard that Menzies became involved with the Whitecart Angels Baseball Club in the mid-90s where he met his fifth victim, then aged around 10.\nHe admitted using lewd, indecent, and libidinous practices and behaviour towards the boy on various occasions.\nThe sixth victim, aged around 13, met Menzies through a family friend and would take part in \"fitness sessions\" held at Bellahouston Park or at Menzies\u2019 home address.\nHe admitted sexually abusing the boy on an occasion in the early to mid-2000s.\nMenzies was the manager and physiotherapist for Cart Castle Youth Football Club in Glasgow when he targeted his seventh victim in the early 2000s.\nThe boy, aged around 13 at the time the abuse began, was shown pornographic films and abused at Menzies\u2019 home.\nMs Parkes commended the victims for coming forward, saying this had led to Menzies' conviction.\nShe said: \u201cHis depraved offending affected many, who now live with the traumatic consequences of his actions.\n\u201cI would urge any victim of similar crime not to suffer in silence but to report it and seek support. Our prosecutors will use every tool available in seeking justice.\u201d\nTony Graham KC, defending, said his client did not remember the offences taking place.\nThe advocate added: \"He does accept that the boys gave evidence to the police and were telling the truth.\"",
    "The remains of a medieval castle that recently underwent major repairs have been targeted by vandals, a council has said.\nWallingford Castle in Oxfordshire was saved from ruin in 2023 following a grant of almost \u00a3300,000 from Historic England.\nBut since the work was completed people have been seen damaging the monument, according to Wallingford Town Council.\nThe vandals were caught on camera within hours of new CCTV being installed at the site, the authority added.\nBuilt in the wake of the Norman invasion under William the Conqueror, the castle is thought to date back to 1067.\nMayor of Wallingford Town Council Daniel Beauchamp said the reparations had now been \"somewhat undone\", with stones having been removed and thrown off the ruin.\n\"We're finding some of the stones that have been repaired on the ground and the big risk here is having done all this work and raised all that funding, we're not going to get that funding again.\"\n\"We had one shot to get this right and we want to make sure it stays as it is.\"\nThe council has since installed extra security measures in an effort to find those causing the damage.\nWithin five hours of the equipment being installed, the first images of vandals were captured, according to the security company uWatch.\nThe company's technical director, Norman Guiver, said: \"The sensors will detect that someone's on the monument and it will tell the cameras to take the picture.\"\nFurther footage of people posing on the ruins was also filmed a day later.\nThe council said it was dedicated to preserving the site's historical integrity.\nA spokesperson said: \"The recent acts of vandalism around the town are a stark reminder of the challenges we face in protecting our heritage. \n\"We urge the community to respect this valuable site and join us in our efforts to safeguard it for future generations.\"\nThe BBC has approached Thames Valley Police for further information.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "More than 1,000 apple, cobnut and broadleaf trees have been planted on an RSPB farm to discover whether agroforestry could be a \"useful tool for farmers\".\nThe trees were planted on an 11 hectare (27 acre) site at the charity's arable farm, between Papworth Everard and Cambridge, in 2022.\nThe long-term project will be monitored for biodiversity, greenhouse gas fluxes and business viability, said assistant farm manager, Sophie Arnold. \nShe said not enough was known about what an agroforest does or does not deliver in terms of \"trade-offs and benefits\" within the UK's farming system. \nAn agroforest uses strips of crop-producing trees alongside arable crops.\n\"The long term hope would be that by putting agroforestry on the farm, we have diversified the farm business so that it could actually be a useful tool for farmers to be a little bit more resilient when farming's becoming increasingly more difficult,\" said Ms Arnold. \n\"We've planted three different types of trees - 13 varieties of apples, all juicing varieties, three varieties of cobnuts, which is a commercial type of hazel which can hopefully be pressed for cobnut oil, and eight species of native broadleaves.\"\nThe native trees will help protect the cropping species from \"the big rolling winds that come through our flatland Cambridgeshire landscape\", she added. \nThey have been planted in eight six-metre (26ft) alleys, 24 metres (78ft) apart, on the RSPB's Hope Farm, which it bought in 2000.\nThe charity took on the 181 hectare (447 acre)-farm to provide research-led evidence it was possible to encourage wildlife-friendly farming in one of the most intensively farmed bread baskets of England, alongside producing food and making a profit.\nToday, 18 farmland birds are based on the farm, such as the linnet, yellowhammer and skylark, while others like lapwings, grey partridges and corn buntings have returned.\nAll are on the UK \"red list\" of endangered species. \nThe RSPB set up the trial at Hope Farm as \"the impact that some agroforestry practices may have on biodiversity is not well evidenced\" - at a time of national tree-planting plans.\nMs Arnold said there will be \"rigorous monitoring\" of the agroforest \"over biodiversity, the greenhouse gas fluxes, the business changes and diversity\".\n\"We aim to get a really thorough understanding of what it actually delivers before we could advocate for or against it in a policy sphere,\" she said. \nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A senior fire commander has thanked local farmers in the Newry area who assisted fire officers with a major blaze near the city centre.\nAt one stage, 50 firefighters were dealing with the incident in the Greenbank industrial estate. \nThe alarm was raised at 11:47 BST on Saturday after it is believed the fire broke out in a kart racing centre and spread to two other units.\nNorthern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) Group Commander, Paul Gould, thanked local farmers who had brought their slurry tanks. \n\"I can't commend them enough,\" he said. \n\"The use of their agricultural vehicles and their help and assistance has been so valuable.\n\"They've been assisting us with their machinery and were able to feed us water, initially, when we didn't have enough resources here and they're still assisting us.\n\"So, I honestly want to thank each and every one of them.\" \nMr Gould said officers had been working in \"dangerous conditions\" as the fire was \"well-developed\" when crews arrived.\nHe added that the blaze had been \"very complicated to deal with\" due to the \"layout and construction of the building\".\nThe fire spread to two other units, including a furniture showroom. \nThe owners of the furniture shop, House of Murphy, a 50-year-old business said their shop had been destroyed. \nSelina Murphy told BBC News NI the shop employs 11 people.\n\"We are in this premises 27 years but this year we were celebrating 50 years in business as the House of Murphy,\" she said.\n\"It's shocking to see what has happened. \n\"The fire service has been unreal - they were on site quickly and attended rapidly,\" she added.\nEarlier, loud popping noises could be heard in the city and large plumes of black smoke were seen from more than 10 miles away.\nThe fire moved from the back, towards the front of the building, and part of it collapsed.\nFlames could be seen leaping over the roof and a large cordon was put in place.\nA convoy of tractors with slurry tanks full of water spent the day dousing down the flames.\nThe heat of the fire was, at one stage, so intense it could be felt from where I was standing, outside Down GAA\u2019s P\u00e1irc Esler.\nEarlier, the fire service and police were concerned about the fire spreading to adjacent premises.\nThe operation to extinguish the blaze is ongoing and, while the NIFRS said resources have scaled down, fire crews are expected to remain at the scene overnight.\nEarlier Mr Gould said a \"large number of resources\" had been deployed to tackle the blaze - six pump appliances, two aerial appliances and one control unit.\nFire officers from Newry, Warrenpoint and Belfast are involved in the operation.\nThe NIFRS has advised residents to \"keep all windows and doors closed in the local area\".\nThe roads around the estate had been closed to traffic earlier but have since reopened. \nEarlier Karen McKevitt, a former SDLP assembly member, told BBC News NI, from the scene, it looked like the flames were \"spreading quite quickly\".\n\"It's bellowing out quite a lot of black, thick smoke and I have been speaking to a few local businesses down in Greenbank who have evacuated their premises as a precautionary [measure] with their windows closed,\" she said.\nMs McKevitt added her thoughts were with the affected businesses based in the industrial estate and the emergency services who were trying to protect them.

    "US actress Shelley Duvall, known for films like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville, has died at the age of 75.\nHer partner Dan Gilroy confirmed the news to The Hollywood Reporter. \n\"My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she\u2019s free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley,\" he said, according to the outlet.\nShe died in her sleep of complications from diabetes at her home in Texas, Gilroy said.\nDuvall's other credits included 1977 drama 3 Women, directed by Robert Altman, for which she won the Cannes Film Festival's best actress award and was nominated for a Bafta.\nThree years later, she starred as Olive Oyl opposite Robin Williams in Altman's musical version of Popeye.\nBut Duvall fell out of favour in Hollywood and was off screens for two decades, before making her comeback in 2023's The Forest Hills.\nWith her large brown eyes and offbeat charisma, Duvall was a distinctive and compelling presence.\nShe began her career, and her association with Altman, in 1970 dark comedy Brewster McCloud, and the pair reunited for McCabe and Mrs Miller in 1971. \nAfter filming her performance as a woman who falls for a 1930s bank robber in their next movie, Thieves Like Us, Altman told her: \"I knew you were good, but I didn't know you were great.\"\nShe said that remark was \"the reason I stuck with it and became an actress\".\nThe director stuck with her, once saying she \"was able to swing all sides of the pendulum: charming, silly, sophisticated, pathetic, even beautiful\".\nAltman cast her again in 1975's Nashville, his satire of US society, politics and country music.\nTheir next collaboration, 3 Women, saw Duvall play a talkative, trend-following health spa attendant. The Guardian's Anne Billson ranked it as her best role, and \"quite simply one of the greatest performances of the 1970s\".\nMeanwhile, also in 1977, Duvall memorably played Pam, a Rolling Stone reporter who went on a date with Woody Allen's Alvy in Annie Hall.\nHer best-known role was perhaps Wendy, the wife of Jack Nicholson's terrifying hotel caretaker in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror classic The Shining.\nFilming was an ordeal. \"I had to cry 12 hours a day, all day long, the last nine months straight, five or six days a week,\" she once recalled.\nAfter that, Duvall's film roles included Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits and Roxanne with Steve Martin.\nShe also set up her own production companies, and made and hosted beloved 1980s children's TV show Faerie Tale Theatre.\nHer acting roles diminished in the 1990s, with Jane Campion\u2019s The Portrait of a Lady the pick of the crop, and she dropped off the radar in 2002.\nThe New York Times attributed her apparent disappearance to the impact of a 1994 earthquake that damaged her Los Angeles home, and the stress of her brother having cancer.\nDiscussing her prolonged absence from the screen, she told the paper in May she had been the victim of a fickle film industry. \"I was a star. I had leading roles. People think it's just ageing, but it's not. It's violence,\" she said.\nAsked to explain, she said: \"How would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime they turn on you?\n\"You would never believe it unless it happens to you. That's why you get hurt, because you can't really believe it's true.\"\nConcerns about her health were raised when she appeared on the TV talk show Dr Phil in 2016 and told him: \"I'm very sick. I need help.\"\nShe also talked about receiving messages from a \"shapeshifting\" Robin Williams following his death, and talked about malevolent forces who were out to do her harm, the paper said.\nSpeaking about that period, Gilroy told the New York Times she had become \"paranoid and just kind of delusional\".\nAsked by the paper why she had agreed to return to the screen in The Forest Hills, she replied: \"I wanted to act again. And then this guy kept calling, and so I wound up doing it.\"\nNovelist Nicole Flattery wrote in the Financial Times in 2023 that her return showed her magic had remained intact.\nIn an article dubbing her the \"ultimate film star\", Flattery summed up her talent, writing: \"She\u2019s a master at playing characters who act happy when they\u2019re sad, their daffiness masking depth.\"\n",
    "The man in the video is beside himself, a mask of anguish radiating through his bloodied face.\n\u201cI am an academic doctor,\u201d he says, \u201cI had a good life, but we have a filthy [Hamas] leadership. They got used to our bloodshed, may God curse them! They are scum!\u201d\nThe video - unthinkable before the Gaza war - was filmed outside a hospital, inundated with hundreds of Palestinian casualties after an Israeli operation to free hostages from central Gaza last month.\nWarning: Graphic image\nSeconds before the video ends, he turns to the crowd.\n\u201cI\u2019m one of you,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you are a cowardly people. We could have avoided this attack!\u201d\nThe video went viral. And it\u2019s not the only one. \nOpen criticism of Hamas has been growing in Gaza, both on the streets and online.\nSome have publicly criticised Hamas for hiding the hostages in apartments near a busy marketplace, or for firing rockets from civilian areas.\nResidents have told the BBC that swearing and cursing against the Hamas leadership is now common in the markets, and that some drivers of donkey carts have even nicknamed their animals after the Hamas leader in Gaza - Yahya Sinwar - urging the donkeys forward with shouts of \"Yallah, Sinwar!\"\n\u201cPeople say things like, \u2018Hamas has destroyed us\u2019 or even call on God to take their lives,\u201d one man said. \n\u201cThey ask what the 7 October attacks were for - some say they were a gift to Israel.\u201d\nSome are even urging their leaders to agree a ceasefire with Israel.\nThere are still those in Gaza fiercely loyal to Hamas and after years of repressive control, it\u2019s difficult to know how far the group is losing support, or how far existing opponents feel more able to speak their mind.\nBut a senior Hamas official privately acknowledged to the BBC, months ago, that they were losing support as a result of the war.\nAnd even some on the group\u2019s own payroll are wavering.\nOne senior Hamas government employee told the BBC that the Hamas attacks were \u201ca crazy, uncalculated leap\u201d.\nHe asked that we concealed his identity.\n\u201cI know from my work with the Hamas government that it prepared well for the attack militarily, but it neglected the home front,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey did not build any safe shelters for people, they did not reserve enough food, fuel and medical supplies. If my family and I survive this war, I will leave Gaza, the first chance I get.\u201d\nThere was opposition to Hamas long before the war, though much of it remained hidden for fear of reprisals.\nThe last time Palestinian elections were held, in 2006, in the party list vote Gazans voted for Hamas in 15 out of 24 seats in the territory - in the other nine districts, voters chose a different party.\nA year later, Hamas violently ejected Palestinian Authority forces from Gaza causing a bitter rift with the rival Fatah movement, and took over the running of the whole Gaza Strip.\nAmeen Abed, a political activist, said he had been arrested many times for speaking out against Hamas before the war, but said - nine months on - dissent was becoming more common there.\n\u201cIn Gaza, most people criticise what Hamas has done,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThey see children living in tents, and insulting their leaders has become routine. But it has a lot of support among those outside Gaza\u2019s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.\u201d\nDesperation and war are eroding social structures in Gaza, and Hamas control is not what it was. \nFour-fifths of Gaza\u2019s population is displaced, often moving between temporary shelters.\nAnd law and order has broken down in places, partly as a result of Israel\u2019s policy of targeting Gaza\u2019s security forces - not just the official Hamas internal security service, but also the community police responsible for street crime.\nAs control has waned, criminal gangs have thrived, looting neighbourhoods and aid convoys; and private security companies - some run by powerful local families - have emerged.\nOne staff member from an aid organisation operating in Gaza described \"absolute chaos at street level\" and \"a state of anarchy\", saying that civilian order had completely broken down as a result of the Israeli policy.\nIsrael\u2019s prime minister has repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities are destroyed.\nBut some aid agencies - in both northern and south areas of Gaza - have also reported regular checks on their activities by local Hamas officials, and videos are frequently circulated of unofficial Hamas security forces shooting and beating those caught looting.\nOne well-placed source told the BBC that dozens of people had been killed by Hamas in bloody score-settling with other local groups, after Israeli troops withdrew from one area.\nFear of criticising Gaza\u2019s leaders might have lessened, but it hasn\u2019t gone, so it is still hard to accurately gauge, beyond individual testimony, how far support for the group is shifting.\nSome, like 26-year-old Jihad Talab, still strongly support Hamas. \nDi",
    "Lawyers representing people who claim to have been affected by pollution on the River Wye have written to three companies they believe are responsible.\nAvara Foods, its subsidiary Freemans of Newent and its 50% shareholder Cargill plc are involved in large-scale chicken production in the Wye catchment area.\nThe letter alleges the companies are responsible for \"major phosphorus pollution\" and asks for compensation.\nAvara said: \"We consider the allegations made by [law firm] Leigh Day to be factually incorrect and fundamentally misconceived.\"\nThe letter sets out details of its nuisance claim against the companies and gives them the opportunity to resolve the dispute before formal court proceedings get under way.\nIt said if a satisfactory response is not received by 20 August, preparations will begin to issue the legal claim in the High Court.\nLeigh Day's letter said Avara and its subsidiary Freemans together control 120 intensive poultry units, and Cargill imports phosphorus-rich soy which is used to feed the poultry in the units.\nThe law firm said poultry numbers in the Herefordshire area have increased from 13 million to 18 million in the last four years and there has been \"a significant increase in the volume of poultry manure being produced\" as a result.\nThis phosphorous-rich manure has been spread on land in the Wye catchment, it said, and it estimated 90% of it enters the river and its tributaries.\nThis has caused algae blooms, reduced oxygen supplies to the river and harm to wildlife and plant life, it said.\nIt claimed this had had a massive negative impact on people\u2019s enjoyment of the Wye and on businesses which depend on it.\nAvara said: \"We are proud of our business, providing high-quality and affordable chicken and turkey for consumers, and we will vigorously defend our position. \nIt added: \"Given the ongoing legal process, we will not be offering further comment at this time.\u201d\nThe company is Herefordshire\u2019s largest private employer and in January 2023 it said all manure from its suppliers was now taken away from the river and used elsewhere in the UK.\nIt also previously said it was reducing the number of its farms in the area from 120 to 104 and the amount of manure produced from 160,000 tonnes a year to 142,000 tonnes.\nAt the time, it said the claim \"ignores the long-standing use of phosphate-rich fertiliser by arable farms as well as the clear scientific data showing the issue of excess phosphorus considerably pre-dates the growth of poultry farms in the Wye catchment.\"\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A retired shopkeeper who was told he was not British despite living in the UK for nearly 50 years can stay for good, the Home Office has decided. \nNelson Shardey, from Wallasey in Wirral, has lived in Britain since arriving as a student in 1977, but in 2019 he was told he had no right to live in the UK.  \nThe 74-year-old, originally from Ghana, has now been granted indefinite leave to remain after the government said it recognised his case was \"exceptional\".\nMore than \u00a348,000 raised towards his legal fight would be donated to charity, Mr Shardey's family said. \nMr Shardey arrived in the UK on a student visa, but a coup in Ghana meant his family was unable to pay his fees. \nHe took on various jobs, including making Mother's Pride bread and Kipling's Cakes near Southampton, and Bendick's Chocolate in Winchester.\nHe said no-one ever queried his right to live or work in the UK.\nHe married a British woman and moved to Wallasey to run his own business, a newsagent called Nelson's News.\nWhen that marriage ended, he married another British woman and they had two sons, Jacob and Aaron.\nMr Shardey says he never left the UK, as he saw no need to and regarded it as his home.\nIn 2007, he was given a police award for bravery after tackling a robber who was attacking a delivery man with a baseball bat.\nBut when he applied for a passport in 2019 so he could return to Ghana after the death of his mother, he was told he was not a British citizen. \nOfficials told him to apply for the 10-year route to settlement which costs about \u00a37,000, with a further \u00a310,500 over the same period to access the NHS \u2013 sums Mr Shardey initially despaired of finding.\nHis case against the Home Office argued he should be treated as an exception because of his long residence in the UK, his bravery award and service to the community.\nThe Home Office said the Immigration Act allowed it discretion to grant Mr Shardey indefinite leave to remain outside the normal immigration rules. \nIt will also waive the application fee.\nMr Shardey said he was \"overwhelmed, very very happy and relieved\". \n\"I would like to thank everybody who believed in us and supported us in words and donations,\" he said. \nMr Shardey added while the \"battle\" was won, he and his supporters \"hope to win the war, for the authorities to agree that the 10-year route is inhuman and abolish it or shorten it\". \nMr Shardey\u2019s lawyer, Nicola Burgess of Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit, said she was thrilled at the decision.\n\"Nelson\u2019s bravery in the face of dysfunctional immigration system has been inspirational,\" said Ms Burgess.\nShe urged the new government to simplify the system to avoid \"many more\" like Mr Shardey, being forced into \"an endless cycle of applications, bureaucracy and expensive fees\".\nMr Shardey\u2019s sons, Aaron and Jacob, said his victory \"means the absolute world to us\".\n\"We are so grateful to our legal team\u2026 and everyone who supported us\u2026 from sharing our story to donating, we cannot thank you enough,\" they added. \nThe family will donate the money they raised to three charities: The Boaz Trust, Clatterbridge Cancer Charity and Wirral Foodbank.\nA Home Office spokesperson said officials were working with Mr Shardey to process his application for indefinite leave to remain. \n\"We apologise for any inconvenience and distress caused,\" the spokesperson added. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Abortion was made legal across the US after a landmark legal ruling in 1973, often referred to as the Roe v Wade case.\nNow the US Supreme Court - the nation's most senior legal body - has overturned that right.\nTwenty-six conservative states are either certain or considered likely to introduce new abortion restrictions or bans.\nIn 1969, a 25-year-old single woman, Norma McCorvey using the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\", challenged the criminal abortion laws in Texas. The state forbade abortion as unconstitutional, except in cases where the mother's life was in danger.\nDefending the anti-abortion law was Henry Wade - the district attorney for Dallas County - hence Roe v Wade.\nMs McCorvey was pregnant with her third child when she filed the case, and claimed that she had been raped. But the case was rejected and she was forced to give birth.\nIn 1973 her appeal made it to the US Supreme Court, where her case was heard alongside that of a 20-year-old Georgia woman, Sandra Bensing. \nThey argued that abortion laws in Texas and Georgia went against the US Constitution because they infringed a woman's right to privacy. \nBy a vote of seven to two, the court justices ruled that governments lacked the power to prohibit abortions.\nThey judged that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was protected by the US constitution.\nThe case created the \"trimester\" system allowing:\nRoe v Wade also established that in the final trimester, a woman can obtain an abortion despite any legal ban only if doctors certify it is necessary to save her life or health.\nThe Supreme Court has ruled in favour of Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks.\nIn doing so, it has effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion for millions of US women.\nIndividual states are now able to ban the procedure again.\nHalf of the states in the US are expected to introduce new restrictions or bans.\nThirteen have already passed so-called trigger laws that will automatically outlaw abortion following the Supreme Court's ruling. A number of others are likely to pass new restrictions quickly.\nThere are nine judges on the Supreme Court, six of whom were appointed by Republican presidents.\nA draft opinion from one of these - Judge Samuel Alito - was leaked in May 2022. It contained the comment that the Roe v Wade judgement is \"egregiously wrong\".\nEven before the US Supreme Court's latest ruling, anti-abortion campaigners had been regaining some ground. \nIn 1980, the court upheld a law that banned the use of federal funds for abortion except when necessary to save a woman's life.\nThen in 1989, it allowed states to prohibit abortions being carried out in state clinics, or by state employees.\nThe biggest impact came from the top court's ruling in Planned Parenthood v Casey in 1992. \nIt said states could restrict abortions even in the first trimester for non-medical reasons.\nAs a result, many states already have restrictions in place, such as requirements that young pregnant women involve their parents or a judge in their abortion decision. \nOther states already have waiting periods between the time a woman first visits an abortion clinic and the actual procedure.\nAs a result, many women are having to travel further to get abortions, often across state borders, and they are having to pay more for them.

    "Amid the packed inbox of Holly Willoughby's Instagram account, Gavin Plumb waited for his message to be answered. \"I wanted to see if you are aware that there is some very real looking images of you online?\" he wrote. \nHis watchful eye was not a caring one, however. In the background, Plumb was planning to kidnap, rape and ultimately murder the TV presenter. How was he caught?\nDuring a forensic search of Gavin Plumb's flat in Harlow, Essex, a handwritten note was found.\nScribbled across a side and a half of paper, a list of the names of 136 female celebrities had been laid out. Top of the pile was Holly Willoughby.\nLater, among a sprawling lair of computers and electronic devices, a Microsoft Word document entitled Wishes was recovered. The ultimate desire - Ms Willoughby.\nAnother text contains just one line: \"In July 2014 Holly and Gavin Plumb (born 25 February 1987) ended their year long affair\".\nTen years on from the conclusion of his fantastical relationship, Plumb's reality is a prison cell.\nThe 37-year-old has been found guilty of soliciting murder, inciting kidnap and inciting rape after his plot against Ms Willoughby was uncovered.\n\"I've got no doubt that Gavin Plumb could've gone on to commit some really horrific crimes,\" says Det Ch Insp Greg Wood, of Essex Police.\nBy his own admission, Plumb was a loner who rarely left his house and had developed an \"obsession\" with the presenter, best known for co-hosting ITV's This Morning alongside Philip Schofield. \nPlumb searched online for other people who found Ms Willoughby attractive and his desires started to spiral.\nSpeaking online to a man only known as Marc, the pair began to devise a plot that would see her abducted from her home by force and taken to a \"dungeon\".\n\"I'm going to be living out my ultimate fantasy,\" Plumb wrote. \"I'm now at the point that fantasy isn't enough anymore. I want the real thing.\" \nThe message comes during an exchange of hundreds of messages between Plumb and Marc, most of which included graphic sexual detail.\nAsked in March 2023 what the final plan was, Plumb, a security guard, said they would \"hit it\" at night so there was less traffic.\n\"Chloroform both of them [Ms Willoughby and her husband] that way then they can both be easily restrained,\" he explained.\n\"We're then gonna force her to make a video saying she come with us under her own free will\u2026 and she\u2019s fully consenting to everything we do to her \u2013 so that covers us.\"\nBy October that year, Marc had got \"cold feet\" and Plumb was using the alias BigBear341987 to post in a group on the Kik chat app called Abduct Lovers - which had about 50 active members.\nSharing four pictures of Ms Willoughby, he wrote: \"The one in the public eye I want.\"\nIt caught the eye of David Nelson, who responded \"nice\" and began to engage in a private conversation with Plumb.\nThe chat led to Plumb outlining his abduction plot to Mr Nelson, including sending him a video of a \"kidnap kit\" he has assembled - including hand and ankle shackles, a rope and a ball gag.\nLittle did Plumb know that Mr Nelson was actually an undercover police officer from the US.\nHaving been alerted by Mr Nelson - via the FBI - Essex Police scrambled into action and officers raided Plumb's house in Potters Field in the new town.\n\"To get such information - certainly from an international law enforcement colleague - is really rare,\" Det Ch Insp Wood said.\n\"Whilst at the address, we identified a number of items that we know that he was going to use to make his plan a reality.\"\nWhen his door was busted in, Plumb initially appeared shocked. However, he knew what the officers were there for.\n\"I can pretty much guess what you're looking for,\" he told them.\nAt the mention of Holly Willoughby, he admitted: \"I\u2019m not going to lie, she is a fantasy of mine \u2013 but she is to a lot of guys, isn\u2019t she?\"\nHis trial heard that two bottles purporting to be chloroform were found, as well as a 31-piece lock-picking set and 400 metal cable ties.\nHandcuffs, two packets of rope and a document containing images of a mapped route from Plumb's address to Ms Willoughby's house were also discovered.\nOn top of a wardrobe, a photograph album packed full of images of women was recovered, while a device containing \"millions\" of pictures of Ms Willoughby - many of which were \"deep fake\" pornographic images - was seized.\nAs devices were taken for analysis, further layers of research began to reveal themselves.\n\"What's it like to be raped\" is just one of the online searches Plumb has made, as well as \"killers from Harlow Essex\" and \"how long does chloroform keep a person unconscious\".\nThe detective continued: \"We found a number of items that were an immediate concern to us that I know he would have used to make his plan reality.\n\"He'd bought items online, he'd tried to recruit like-minded people to make his plan a reality.\n\"He had all the items he needed to cause Holly Willoughby some serious harm.\"\nDuring his trial, Plumb maintained he was \"too overweight\" to ",

    "Two newly elected politicians have said they be will be putting pressure on councils to improve access to special needs education.\nReform UK\u2019s Nigel Farage, who was elected as MP for Clacton, Essex, and James McMurdock, who won in South Basildon and East Thurrock, Essex, said they would work together after hearing the concerns of families during their campaigns.\nEssex County Council has been criticised for delays in assessing children for educational health care plans within 20 weeks, with some waiting over a year.\nMr Farage said: \u201cWe as MPs cannot directly affect special needs provision as that is a county council issue, but... [we can] go to Essex County Council and say what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nMr McMurdock said a big part of his election campaign had been listening to parents of children with special needs who have been struggling to get support.\nHe added: \u201cChildren of all different abilities should be able to get an education that works much better for them.\u201d\nWhen asked if this meant Reform UK would be tackling local issues, and not just focusing on national politics of immigration, Mr Farage said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m talking about immigration, I\u2019m talking about the population explosion. Have a look at Essex\u2019s roads, look at the lack of GP services. We are going to be MPs that look at local issues.\u201d\nBoth will be sworn into Parliament over the coming days to take up their seats as MPs.

    "Consumer goods giant Dyson plans to cut up to a third of its UK workforce as part of a global shake-up.\nThe company, best known for the invention of the bag-less vacuum cleaner, said the proposals would ensure it was \u201cprepared for the future\u201d amid what it called \u201cincreasingly fierce and competitive global markets\u201d.\nBut the move comes after staunch, long-running criticism from its founder Sir James Dyson of the UK economy policies, and the business moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2019.\nDyson currently has 3,500 UK employees, with offices in Wiltshire, Bristol and London.\nCEO Hanno Kirner said the company needed to be \"entrepreneurial and agile\".\n\u201cDecisions which impact close and talented colleagues are always incredibly painful,\" he said.\n\"Those whose roles are at risk of redundancy as a result of the proposals will be supported through the process.\"\nDyson moved its head office to Singapore in 2019 to be closer to its manufacturing sites and supply chains. Asian markets account for more than half of its sales and Singapore also has a free trade agreement with the EU.\nThe company, which also makes air purifiers and hair dryers among other appliances, is still highly profitable. It increased its research and development spending by 40% last year.\nDyson has stated the announcement is a business decision, not a political one, and a result of its global review.\nBut Sir James has been highly critical of the UK\u2019s economic policies. \nLast year he said the UK had \u201cwoeful policies\u201d such as high corporation tax, and said he would invest more in \u201cmodern, forward-looking economies elsewhere\u201d that encourage growth and innovation.\nBusiness of all sizes, much like households, have been hit by rising costs and bills in recent times. Corporation tax, which is paid on the profits of UK companies to the government, increased in April 2023 to 25% from 19%.\nDyson said the UK would \"remain a vital centre\" for the companies research and development (R&D), as well as the home of the Dyson Institute, which has 160 undergraduate engineers.\nBut one Dyson employee who received notice today told the BBC though the physical R&D building remained, \"everyone involved in R&D have now exited all Dyson buildings\".\n\"All in stark contrast to James' promise that R&D would remain in the UK after the Singapore headquarter move. We believe this is obviously to cut costs by using our South East Asian counterparts who are cheaper to employ,\" they claimed.\n\"Whether this capability will return over the next few weeks remains to be seen.\"\nIn response to the BBC, Dyson said the claim was \"categorically not correct\".\nDanni Hewson, head of financial analysis at investment firm AJ Bell, said while the company had made it clear its plans were a long time in the making, there \u201chave been questions about the future of the business in the UK since 2019\u201d, when it moved its headquarters overseas.\n\u201cNews that British appliance manufacturer Dyson is to pare back its UK workforce by a quarter is a significant blow not just to those losing their jobs but also Labour\u2019s push to get the economy growing.\n\u201cThe decision is an uncomfortable one and begs the question whether Sir James Dyson and his company believe the future must be found elsewhere.\u201d\nRoz Savage, the new Liberal Democrat MP for the South Cotswolds, said she was worried by the announcement.\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s huge. Malmesbury is a close-knit community and I\u2019m sure if people are in danger of losing their jobs then their pain is going to be felt by the whole community, by the local businesses and the local economy is going to be affected. \n\"This is potentially very big news and I\u2019m very concerned.\u201d\nWiltshire Council leader Richard Clewer said the council would do all it could to support those impacted during \"an uncertain time\".\nMr Clewer, who is also the councillor responsible for economic development, said he was \"extremely sorry to hear\" of the announcement, adding that many Dyson workers were based in Wiltshire.\nProf Andrew Graves, a mechanical engineer and political scientist from the University of Bath, said those inside the industry were not surprised by the announcement and \"had been warning about this for a long time\".\n\"Right across the world there is huge competition with the Dyson products and a lot of Dyson products really haven\u2019t been successful of late,\" he said.\n\"They put aside two billion to build an electric car in Hullavington and that was withdrawn fairly quickly when they realised it was too difficult.\n\u201cAnd also some of their latest products haven\u2019t been too great in the market place, they are really fighting on all fronts at the moment.\n\"This is a huge amount of cost-cutting,\" he added. \nProf Graves added if there were large scale redundancies it would be \"devastating\" for the town of Malmesbury. \nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, the firm cut 600 jobs in the UK and a further 300 worldwide, saying people were changing how they bought products. \nDyson was founded by inventor Sir James Dyson w",

    "The bloodiest day of the 1984 miners' strike was orchestrated in Downing Street, the senior legal adviser to the Welsh government has said.\nCounsel general for Wales Mick Antoniw has called on the new Labour UK government to deliver on its promise of an inquiry into violence at Orgreave as soon as possible.\nThe BBC has taken miners back to the South Yorkshire town to re-live the most \"frightening\" day of their lives.\nBut Robert Griffiths, a former police officer from Denbigh who volunteered to work at Orgreave, has accused miners of attacking police horses.\nThe Battle of Orgeave, as it came to be known, was a pivotal moment in the year-long miners' strike and one of the most violent episodes in British industrial history.\nStriking coal miners from across Britain descended on the coking plant to try and disrupt deliveries - they were met with force by thousands of police officers.\nMiners threw stones at police lines, and mounted officers charged at picketers, followed by specialised units known as \"snatch squads\".\nAt least 120 miners and police officers were injured in the violence.\n\"A massacre. That day was the most frightening day of my life and I\u2019ve carried a man out from underground who was killed.\"\nRon Stoate, 74, was vice-chairman of the Penallta Lodge in Rhymney Valley and was at Orgreave on the day of the violence.\n\"We walked into a well planned and well orchestrated attack from the police.\"\nThe Orgreave coking works are now long gone, but standing on a hill overlooking the town Ron said the \"bitterness and anger\" he feels is as strong now as it was four decades ago.\nRon has called on the new Labour government to deliver on its promise of an inquiry as soon as possible.\n\"I will never forget it.\"\nThere have been calls for an inquiry for the past 40 years, spearheaded by the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign.\nNinety-five miners were arrested that day and 55 were charged with riot, which at the time was punishable with a life sentence.\nAnother 40 miners were charged with unlawful assembly, but their trials collapsed when police evidence was deemed unreliable.\nLabour committed to an \"investigation or inquiry\" into events at Orgreave in the party's manifesto.\nBBC Wales asked the UK government when it may begin and how it would be carried out and was told: \"Information will be set out in due course but there is no detailed information we can share as of yet.\"\nLord Heseltine, who was a minister in prime minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet at the time, declined to be interviewed.\nNow Mr Antoniw, who as a young solicitor represented miners arrested at Orgreave, has urged the new Labour government in Westminster to launch an inquiry.\nHe said: \"It is my strong belief that those decisions came from Downing Street, they came from the top of government.\n\"It was a political decision to directly intervene in the miners' strike and basically to give the miners a good beating, to teach them a lesson, to make an example of them by long prison sentences.\"\nHe believes there are parallels between Orgreave and the Hillsborough disaster, which was also policed by the South Yorkshire force.\nMr Antoniw believes that, had justice powers been devolved to Wales, miners prosecuted during the strike would have now been pardoned, like in Scotland, where ministers are in charge of justice.\nSouth Yorkshire Police paid \u00a3425,000 in damages to 39 miners who sued over assault, unlawful arrest and malicious prosecution.\nThe force did not admit wrongdoing and no officers have faced misconduct proceedings or prosecution.\nIn 2015, an Independent Police Complaints Commission review concluded there was evidence some\u00a0officers deployed at Orgreave had\u00a0committed perjury and assault and perverted the course of justice.\nPolice officer Mr Griffiths said he feared for his life that day and there was violence on both sides.\n\"Missiles started being rained upon us - ball bearings, bricks and bits of metal\", he said.\n\"I turned to a colleague, Stan, and I remember saying: 'I think we're gonna die here'.\nHe said he remembered some miners targeting police horses, including one who \"punched the police horse in its face\".\nHe said when his colleague pulled the reins and the horse's head \"went smash straight into that miner\", the striker asked him: \"What are you gonna do about that?\"\nTo which the officer replied: \"Absolutely nothing, you deserved that.\"\nHe added: \"The war with the miners had to be won. I was one of Maggie's boys, I knew I was a tool being used by the government to beat the miners.\"\nMr Griffiths does not think there should be an inquiry as \"it's history, and I believe it should be left as history\".\nPhotographer, Roger Tiley, 64, was arguably closer to the action than any other photographer that day as he was among the miners.\nHe called it \"by far the worst day of my life\" and believes events were orchestrated for the media.\n\"There were television cameras placed strategically on a building and there were press photographers on the side.\n\"The p",

    "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro benefited from an illegal scheme to sell $1.2m (\u00a3937,000) in jewellery and other luxury gifts given to his government, police investigators say.\nIt comes after Brazil's Federal Police last week recommended charging him with crimes including money-laundering over undeclared jewellery gifted between 2019 and 2022.\nThe latest police report states that officials had \"acted to divert\" expensive gifts to Mr Bolsonaro from foreign governments. The officials then sought to sell the items for \"the illicit enrichment of the then president\". \nThe far-right politician has claimed that cases against him are politically motivated. \nThe report submitted to the Supreme Federal Court on Monday says that cash raised from such sales was paid to the former president \"without using the formal banking system\".\nProsecutors have been given 15 days to decide whether to formally charge Mr Bolsonaro.\nThe case centres on allegations that he tried to illegally import and keep millions of dollars' worth of jewellery given to him and his wife by Saudi Arabia in 2019.\nThe jewels were impounded by Brazilian customs officials when a member of Mr Bolsonaro's entourage tried to bring them into the country in 2021.\nThe police report says the jewellery included Rolex watches and Patek Phillipe watches, as well as diamond pieces from luxury brand Chopard.\nMr Bolsonaro's team later returned some of the jewellery once news of the case was reported, it added.\nThe former president's lawyer, Paulo Cunha, posted on social media that heads of state \"have no direct or indirect influence\" on what happens to official gifts.\nMr Bolsonaro is also facing other legal challenges, including an investigation into whether he incited rioters who stormed key government buildings after he narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing rival, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\nThis led to unsubstantiated claims by his supporters of voting fraud - eventually escalating into the violent scenes in the capital.\nHe has voiced \"regret\" for the unrest, but denies he caused it.\nHowever, Brazil's Supreme Court has agreed to include him in its investigation into the storming of government buildings on 8 January 2023.

    "French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has appealed to voters to block the National Rally (RN) party of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella from winning Sunday's general election.\nThe party led the first round last Sunday with more than 33% of the vote and has already won dozens of seats outright. If it secures more than half the 577 seats in the National Assembly, it will be be able to form a government.\n\"There's one bloc in a position to win an absolute majority, and that's the far right,\" Mr Attal told French radio.\nMany French voters would not enjoy using their vote to block RN, he said, but \"I consider it's our responsibility to do it\".\nThe second round of a French parliamentary is generally made up largely of run-off duels between the top two candidates in a constituency, but because so many third-placed candidates qualified on Sunday, that set up more than 300 three-way run-offs.\nSome 218 candidates for either the left-wing alliance or Mr Attal's centrist bloc  withdrew their names before Tuesday evening's deadline to give a political rivals a greater chance of defeating the RN.\nMarine Le Pen condemned what she called the political class for \"giving an increasingly grotesque image of itself\".  \nParty leader Jordan Bardella, who is favourite to become prime minister under an RN government, denounced an \"alliance of dishonour\". He told Le Figaro newspaper he found it regrettable to see a president who had accused the radical left France Unbowed of antisemitism now \"throwing himself into the arms of [its leader] Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\".\nMr Bardella was confident his party still had a chance of winning an outright majority on Sunday, because they had an ambition and a project for France. He already has the support of part of the conservative Republicans party, and he has appealed to the rest to join him and reject the \"Macron-M\u00e9lenchon coalition\".\nIf the RN is unable to form a government, there is speculation that some kind of coalition could be formed without either the RN or radical left. But the prime minister said he would not impose any coalition on France that they did not choose.\nPresident Macron has vowed to continue in office whatever the result, until his term ends in 2027. He had no need to call the parliamentary vote, but after his party's poor performance in European elections last month, he said a vote was the only way of enabling France to \"move on and reunite\".\nNot everyone in the centrist camp is happy they have ended up making deals with a left-wing alliance that includes Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, and there is no evidence that French voters will do as the party leaders suggest and vote for a party they would otherwise avoid.\nMr M\u00e9lenchon has been accused of defending anti-police sentiment and has come under fire for refusing to call Hamas a terrorist organisation.\nMr Attal made clear that withdrawing candidates in favour of the New Popular Front did not mean they were joining forces with Mr M\u00e9lenchon. \"There isn't and there never will be any alliance with France Unbowed,\" he promised.\nHowever, the broad agreement to withdraw candidates has left some bizarre choices for French voters. \nInterior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin now goes into a run-off against his RN rival, after Leslie Mortreux of France Unbowed pulled out, and the same goes for former Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne.\nAmong the third-placed Macron candidates to drop out were two ministers, Sabrina Agresti-Roubache and Marie Gu\u00e9venoux. \n\u00c9douard Philippe, who was prime minister for three years at the start of the Macron presidency in 2017, said he would vote for a Communist candidate in the second round.\nBut he made clear he would not support Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's party, after witnessing how it had contributed to political chaos.\n\"I'd rather have an MP I know and who I can work with... even if we have differences, who I think shares my democratic requirements, rather than the National Rally,\" he told TF1 TV.\nFran\u00e7ois Hollande, the former Socialist president who was originally Emmanuel Macron's boss at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, said the concerted withdrawals had \"minimised\" the chances of the far right winning an absolute majority, although it could not be \"ruled out\".\nMr Attal chaired a cabinet meeting on Wednesday which may be his last as prime minister.\nNational Rally boss Marine Le Pen accused him of using the occasion to make a series of new appointments, including police chiefs.\nGovernment spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot hit back, saying that she should read the constitution.\n\"I think we knew that Madame Le Pen lied, now we know she manipulates information,\" she said. Such appointments were nothing new, she said, especially when it came to preparing for the start of the next school year.\nMeanwhile, the head of France's confederation of small and medium enterprises, Fran\u00e7ois Asselin, complained that President Macron's decision to dissolve parliament had cost France \"a quarter of growth\" and nobody appeared to have taken the economy into account.\nIf either",

    "Cambridge United supporters will be able to vote for their club's new crest ahead of a change in identity for the 2025/26 season.\nThree different designs, based on fan feedback, have been developed over the course of the year so supporters can have a voice about the direction the club should go in.\nCEO Alex Tunbridge said the club believed modernising the crest and identity was important to growth and development \"at a time of ever greater sporting and financial competition\".\nSupporters will have the opportunity to provide feedback through consultation events. An online survey will open on 5 August.\nDirection One keeps some of the key features of the current crest, including the shape and the representation of the Magdalene Bridge.\nInstead of the \"CU\" initials being shown front and centre, it displays the full \"CUFC\" initials, and the monogram style nods to the club's original crest - the Abbey United shield.\nDesigner Chris Payne said: \"We worked really hard to retain key features of the existing design, such as the bridge and the turrets and the basic shape of the crest.\n\"We also we saw this as an opportunity to take out some of the features of the current design that might not be working so well in this modern age, such as the 1980s football, the small banner at the bottom of the crest and the CU lettering - which we understand is offensive in a few different languages.\n\"So, as part of the identity's evolution, we simplify the design and reintroduce the club's full initials, CUFC.\"\nThe origin of Cambridge United can be found in Abbey United, the club\u2019s name from 1912 to 1948, which is believed to come from Abbey Church on Newmarket Road.\nDirection Two aims to celebrate the club\u2019s origins and former name by bringing elements of the abbey and Cambridge\u2019s city-centre architecture into the badge.\nMr Payne said Direction Two was designed for fans who wanted the new identity to be bold.\n\"The Abbey Inspired design is highly unique, yet its inspiration is rooted in Cambridge United's beginnings,\" he said.\n\"I spent a lot of time in Cambridge researching this project, and one of the first things I noticed was this arch shape in abundance.\n\"You just have to spend five minutes in Cambridge city centre and you will see this arched shape everywhere, from iconic buildings and bridges to arched windows and doors. This shape is a key part of Cambridge's identity.\"\nDirection Three is a more traditional design with balance, symmetry and simplicity, incorporating all the design elements within the classic shield.\nThis design offers an option to supporters who would like to see a more traditional crest and the return of the book and ball.\nMr Payne said they wanted to offer fans a more traditional design alongside Directions One and Two, which he said were more abstract.\nHe said: \"The Book and Ball is such an interesting idea and it's a concept that is not new to Cambridge United fans. We spent a long time looking at the book and ball design of the 1970s and sought to reimagine it.\n\"Similar to Direction Two, the strength of this design is its story.\n\"The book and ball ties back to past identities, as well as the rules of football being formalised in Cambridge. It also provides a subtle nod to Cambridge's renowned education system.\"\nMr Tunbridge encouraged fans to have their say.\n\"We believe that modernising our crest and identity is important to our growth and development at a time of ever greater sporting and and financial competition,\" he said.\n\"We also all recognise that this is a sensitive subject where people understandably have strong views,  so our start point has always been to do this in full collaboration with the fans.\n\"It is why we didn\u2019t push through the proposed new design this time last year.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Airbus is to take over part of the Spirit AeroSystems operation in Belfast.\nSpirit is Northern Ireland\u2019s most significant manufacturing employer, with about 3,500 staff.\nAirbus is taking control of the part of the business which makes wings and fuselage for its A220 jet.\nThe future of Spirit's plant in Prestwick is also in doubt, after it agreed to be taken over by Boeing.\nThere is uncertainty for the non-Airbus parts of the Belfast business, with Spirit saying it will sell them separately.\nThat part of the business includes a range of work on Bombardier business jets.\nThe Ulster Unionist MLA, Steve Aiken, said Airbus taking over just the A220 work \"leaves large questions about the rest of the Spirit business\" and called on the economy minister to give \"urgent clarity\" on the issue.\nThe structure of the deal will likely cause alarm among trade unions and the Northern Ireland manufacturing sector.\nThe Unite trade union estimates that about 40% of the staff in the Belfast operation are employed in Airbus work; about 60% in non-Airbus work.\nRegional co-ordinator at Unite, George Brash, said there was no certainty in the statement provided about jobs.\n\"Any carve up of the 60% of the workforce that's left will not be good for our members, or for Northern Ireland,\" he added.\n\"Our position is clear, the site needs to remain as one entity and intact.\"\nEarlier this year Sir Michael Ryan, the chair of Spirit in the UK, wrote to local stakeholders warning that \u201cany dismantling of the business would be extremely detrimental to the long-term future of the Belfast business, and by extension, the region\u2019s aerospace industry\u201d.\nIn the letter, obtained by the Financial Times, he said that while the separation of physical buildings was possible, the company\u2019s structure and ecosystem was \u201cintegrally linked\u201d and gave it \u201ceconomies of scale, providing technological synergies, skills and flexibility\u201d.\nInvest Northern Ireland said in a statement that it recognises the \"uncertainty\" the news brings to the staff of Spirit AeroSystems and it acknowledges \"the impact it may have on many individuals and families\". \nIt said it is committed to supporting Spirit AeroSystems in seeking \"the best outcome for Northern Ireland and the workforce here\".\nSpirit\u2019s wider global business is being carved up between Boeing and Airbus, the world\u2019s largest aircraft manufacturers.\nSpirt was founded in 2005 when part of Boeing\u2019s business was spun off as a separate company.\nMonday\u2019s deal was initiated by Boeing which wants to bring Spirit back in house as part of its efforts to tackle manufacturing problems.\nBoeing is paying $4.3bn (\u00a33.3bn) for its part of the deal whereas Spirit will pay Airbus $559m (\u00a3440.6m) reflecting the fact that the parts of the business Airbus is taking over are currently loss making.\nAirbus will also take control of two Spirit factories in the US, one in France and one in Morocco.\nAirbus said the deal \"aims to ensure stability of supply\" for its commercial aircraft programmes, both operationally and financially.\n\nThe sale places the future of one of Scotland\u2019s most advanced manufacturing plants in doubt.\nSpirit Aerosystems has recently employed up to 1,000 workers at the factory in Prestwick where it makes parts of aircraft wings for both Boeing and Airbus.\nThe company announcement indicates that Prestwick will continue to supply Boeing after becoming part of that company. \nBut it is not clear what will happen to the Airbus contract.\nSpirit has been in Northern Ireland since 2019 when it bought Bombardier's operations.\nAt the time, that deal ended a long period of uncertainty for the workforce.\nEarlier this year Spirit said it would invest in the Belfast factory and hire more staff as it ramps up production for the A220.\nAirbus wants to step up the production rate of the A220 by 50% in 2024, with another increase in 2025.",

As a tennis referee, Ms Taylor is used to making tough calls under pressure.\nThe former councillor won with a majority of 2,198 and is the first woman to take the seat.\nBorn and schooled in North Warwickshire, Ms Taylor has talked up her local roots. For 20 years, she worked as a property solicitor and helped to run a retail business in the area.\nShe said \u201cthere\u2019s so much that needs doing in our constituency\u201d, including \u201cgetting our high streets back on track\u201d.\nThe general election was a midsummer night\u2019s dream for new Liberal Democrat MP for William Shakespeare.\nManuela Perteghella became the first Liberal to win Stratford-on-Avon since 1906, and the first female MP to represent the constituency.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional time,\u201d was how it was summed up by Ms Perteghella, a former university lecturer, councillor, and governor of a primary school. \nBorn in Italy, Ms Perteghella has lived in the UK for more than 30 years and holds a doctorate in literature and translation.\nFittingly, she analysed Shakespeare\u2019s plays during her PhD and now she\u2019s writing her own political script as the MP for the playwright\u2019s birthplace.\nAnother female-first came in the bellweather seat of Nuneaton, where Jodie Gosling was elected.\nShe was a councillor and the Labour opposition group leader on North Warwickshire Borough Council before being elected as Nuneaton\u2019s MP.\nAs a nursery manager and teacher, education is close to her heart and that passion showed when she accompanied now Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a visit to a primary school in Nuneaton.\n\u201cWe are focused on the priorities to transform the lives of people here in Nuneaton,\u201d Ms Gosling said in her victory speech.\nAfter dominating the seat for 14 years, the Conservatives faced the music in Rugby, where instrumentalist John Slinger hit the right notes.\nThe long-time Labour activist, and former McDonald\u2019s worker, won the seat with a majority of 4,428.\nA classically trained violinist who played in a local rock band, he\u2019s a music lover who has been pulling strings as a partner in a strategic communications company.\nHaving lived in Rugby since 2006, he was elected as a councillor last year before putting himself forward as a parliamentary candidate.\nNewly elected in Coventry, but not new to Parliament, Mary Creagh was an MP for 14 years before she lost her Wakefield seat in the 2019 general election.\nNow she\u2019s ended her House of Commons hiatus after winning Coventry East with a 11,623 majority.\nBorn in Coventry, where her father was a car factory worker and her mother a primary school teacher, Ms Creagh studied modern languages at Oxford and worked as an intern at the European Parliament.\nShe was a government whip when Gordon Brown was prime minister and held several shadow cabinet posts before returning to the backbenches during Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stint as Labour leader.\nTaiwo Owatemi and Zarah Sultana, two Labour MPs who first entered Parliament in 2019, retained their seats in Coventry.\nMs Owatemi is a qualified pharmacist who has served as shadow minister for women and equalities, while Ms Sultana is chair of the Socialist Campaign Group and has been one of the most vocal MPs about the war in Gaza.\nLabour\u2019s Matt Western held his seat of Warwick and Leamington with an increased majority of 12,412.

    "Twenty-five years after bursting on to the scene, it appears rapper Eminem's provocative alter ego Slim Shady has finally been silenced.\nThe antagonistic Slim Shady, with his peroxide-blond hair and everyman blue jeans, stemmed from Eminem's self-described \"white trash\" upbringing.\nIn a surprise April announcement teased as a mock murder news report, Eminem revealed his latest album would be called The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Gr\u00e2ce).\nThe title suggested a fittingly violent end to Slim Shady, with the rapper himself concluding: \"I knew it was only a matter of time.\"\nOn Friday, the album was finally released, complete with artwork showing Shady in a body bag, and was met by mixed reviews from critics.\nIt follows the music video for single Tobey, in which Eminem takes a chainsaw to his Jekyll and Hyde-like counterpart. \nSo, if the rapper's alter ego really has risen to his feet for the last time - how should we understand his legacy?\nBorn Marshall Mathers III, Eminem was raised in Michigan's low-income, majority-black Detroit neighbourhoods. \nRap became an escape when he was a teenager, from a childhood of strained parental relationships and bullying.\nHe tried to break into the music scene, and felt \u201ccrushed\u201d when Vanilla Ice became the face of white solo rap in 1990, his pop-party track Ice Ice Baby selling millions. \n\u201cIce\u2019s name became synonymous with selling out and manufactured success,\u201d surmised The Ringer\u2019s Justin Sayles.\nBut Mathers was different, \"a true product of ghetto streets,\" wrote Nick Hasted in his Eminem biography. \nThis left him uniquely placed to manage what Jeff Weiss called the \u201ccultural debt\u201d faced by white rap artists.\nIt helped that his flow, honed through years of rap battles, was spectacular.\nProf Anthony Kwame Harrison, a sociologist specialising in hip-hop, praised Eminem's skills, saying \"his outstanding rhyming and songcraft made him the last white rap pioneer\". \nDespite this, his 1996 album, Infinite, failed to attract major labels.\nHis early mentors, the Bass Brothers, suggested the idea of \"shock-rap\", which led to the birth of Slim Shady.\n\"The market didn't take to it until he got a little foul-mouthed,\" added Mark Bass.\nThe resulting Slim Shady EP found its way to mogul Jimmy Iovine and NWA rap royalty Dr Dre, who immediately signed Eminem to Interscope.\nDre discovered in Slim Shady an anti-hero. Eminem\u2019s crossover appeal from Dre\u2019s co-sign was cemented with features alongside respected black rappers.\nTheir production partnership may have bridged some of rap's racial divides but, in unleashing 1999's Slim Shady LP on an unsuspecting public, also spawned contradictions in Slim Shady and Eminem\u2019s legacy that persist to this day.\nEminem's arrival as Slim Shady on the lead single, My Name Is, was timed perfectly for chaotic impact. While America reportedly enjoyed its \"happiest decade\" during the 90s, Shady revealed a disillusioned white underbelly. \nThe Slim Shady LP sold 500,000 copies in two weeks and earned two of Eminem's 15 Grammys. It was the last time an Eminem record didn\u2019t debut at number one.\nThe chart-topping Marshall Mathers LP released just a year later took aim at outraged parents, politicians, and societal hypocrisy. Shady revelled in outraging prim white suburbia, crudely proclaiming unspoken truths. \u201cThere\u2019s a million of us just like me... who cuss like me,\u201d he spat.\nA 2000 MTV performance of the track saw Shady lead an army of lookalikes into the auditorium, goading critics. \nRolling Stone declared he had gone from \"white trash to white hot\u201d.\nBut despite his success, controversy over his lyrics' violent misogyny and homophobia darken his legacy.\nDepictions of murder, rape, and slurs continued in The Marshall Mathers LP and beyond, defended by the rapper as movie-style fantasy.\nSpin's 1999 review called Eminem a \"timebomb of anger\" within white male culture.\nVox culture reporter Constance Grady adds that Eminem's breakthrough era viewed \"hypocrisy as the last big social ill left,\" which justified \"ironic\" misogyny and homophobia as acceptable. \nEminem told Rolling Stone in 2000, \"the kids listening to my music get the joke\". \nMathers himself is a dichotomy, with Shady\u2019s antics counter-balanced by his thought-provoking raps as Eminem.\nThe track best demonstrating Eminem's self-awareness is Stan. \nIts groundbreaking narrative storytelling follows an obsessed Shady fan who kills himself and his girlfriend when Eminem does not reply to his letters. The track ends with Eminem's apologetic response for the delay.\nDr Phoenix Andrews, a writer on fandoms, says the track was prescient in understanding today's intense internet followings and portraying the pressure and responsibility within artist/fan relationships.\n\"Men talking about mental health was much rarer then and is still stigmatised,\" Dr Andrews says. \"Eminem reaching out to Stan and not mocking him was exceptional at the time.\"\nThe conflicts of Eminem's personas have had other unintended consequences.\nThe ",

When they connected, Helen saw a uniformed man whose face matched the police ID he flashed.\nOfficer Fang then used his phone to give her a tour of what looked like a fully functioning police station with several uniformed officers and a desk with a large police logo.\n\u201cThat moment all my suspicions are gone. So I say: 'I'm sorry, I just have to be careful nowadays, there are a lot of criminals out there',\u201d Helen says.\nWhile they were talking, Helen heard a message on the tannoy in the background, telling Officer Fang to take a call about her.\nOfficer Fang put her on hold and when he returned he was no longer interested in the illegal parcel. He said he had been informed that Helen was suspected of involvement in a large financial fraud.\n\n\u201cI said: 'That\u2019s nonsense'. He said: 'Nobody says they\u2019re guilty. So it\u2019s the evidence that counts'.\u201d\nHelen was shown what looked like a bank statement for a vast amount of money in her name. Officer Fang told her that if she was innocent she must help them catch the real crooks. He made her sign a confidentiality agreement promising not to tell anyone about the investigation. Helen was warned that if she did, she would get an extra six months in prison\n\u201cHe said: 'If you tell anyone you have been interviewed by the Chinese police, your life will be in danger'.\u201d\nThe scammers also made Helen download an app so they could listen in to what she was doing day and night.\nOver the next few days, Helen tried to act normally at work. She spent her evenings working on a personal statement that she was ordered to write, detailing every aspect of her life.\nThen Officer Fang called back with the news that several suspects were now in custody. He showed her written statements in which several people accused her.\nHelen was sent a video which appeared to show a male prisoner confessing to police, and naming her as his boss in the fraud.\nWe have taken a closer look at the video, and because the suspect is wearing a large Covid mask, it\u2019s impossible to tell if what you\u2019re hearing matches his lip movements. It would be easy to add a fake soundtrack that mentions Helen's name or another victim.\nBut for Helen - who had been convinced she was dealing with genuine police officers - the effect was devastating: \u201cAfter I heard my name like that I was vomiting. It convinced me I was in deep, deep trouble.\u201d\nHelen believed Officer Fang when he then told her she would be extradited to China - even though she\u2019s a British citizen.\n\u201cHe told me: 'So you got 24 hours, you pack your bags. The police are coming to take you to the airport'.\u201d\nHelen was told she could halt her extradition if she could raise bail. After sending over her bank statements for inspection, she was told to transfer \u00a329,000.\n\u201cI felt terrible, because I promised my daughter to give her money for her first flat,\u201d Helen says.\nBut a few days l",

    "Advertising by Luton airport was misleading, the regulator has ruled.\nThe promotional material that attracted complaints contained references to environmental limits and airport expansion by Luton Rising, the airport's owner.\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the messaging, which featured in a magazine and on a London Underground poster, \"omitted significant information\".\nLuton Rising, which is owned by Luton Council, had defended the advertising.\nDetails of the ASA investigation have been outlined in a written ruling.\nThe ASA said the magazine advertisement included text that said: \u201cIf we miss our environmental limits, our expansion will be stopped in its tracks.\n\"If London Luton Airport breaks the environmental limits set out in its expansion proposal, it won\u2019t mean an apology, it will mean further expansion is stopped.\"\nThe text alongside Luton Rising's logo was \u201cour airport, our community, our planet\u201d.\nThe ASA said the poster advertisement featured similar claims.\nComplainants included Adfree Cities, an organisation which challenges \"corporate outdoor advertising\", and the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport.\nThey argued that the advertisements were misleading because they \"omitted significant information\" about the \"environmental impact of the expansion\".\nThe ASA upheld the complaints and ruled that the advertisements were misleading.\nIt said the advertisements \"must not appear again in the form complained of\", and added: \"We told London Luton Airport Ltd t/a Luton Rising to ensure future claims were adequately qualified and did not omit material information about the environmental impact of London Luton Airport\u2019s expansion.\"\nThe ruling said the \"basis of environmental claims\" had to be clear, and \"unqualified claims could mislead\" if they omitted \"significant information\".\nIt indicated that information relating to air traffic emissions had been omitted.\nThat exclusion was \"material information\" likely to \"affect people\u2019s understanding\" of the overall message.\nThe ruling added: \"We concluded the ads omitted significant information and were therefore misleading.\"\nLuton Rising said the purpose of the advertising was to show  that \"mitigating environmental impacts were central to the airport\u2019s expansion plans\".\nIt added: \"A fundamental part of their plan was to grow London Luton Airport sustainably, and not at the expense of the environment.\n\"If expansion was approved, Luton Rising would implement its Green Controlled Growth Framework which placed limits on noise, air quality, emissions from the airport\u2019s operations and road traffic that would halt expansion if breached or there was a risk they might be breached.\"\nLuton Rising argued that such an approach was \"summarised\" in the advertising.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A woman from Scarborough has said she faces choosing between \"feeding my children or fixing their teeth\" after the privatisation of one of the town's last remaining NHS dental practices.\nCheryl Mann said she was \"devastated\" when she heard the Falsgrave and Alma practice was to end NHS appointments.\nThe practice has sent a letter to patients saying from September it would be offering only private treatment, with existing NHS patients needing to pay for a dental plan.\nAn NHS spokesperson said the situation was \"ultimately a practice decision\".\nMs Mann, 36, a mother of two teenage sons, has been a patient at the Alma Square dentist in Scarborough for 16 years and has a condition which means she suffers from constant pain and infection which can affect her teeth.\nShe said finding out her dentist was to go private had been \"really scary\".\n\"A private dentist is beyond our reach, we're struggling as it is,\" she said.\nMs Mann said if her children needed to go to the dentist she would have to choose \"between filling up my food cupboards and heating my home or fixing my children's teeth\".\n\"There's thousands of people going to be affected by this and a lot are on low incomes.

    "David Lammy\u2019s whirlwind first trip as foreign secretary, organised at very short notice, is not about instant results or even brave new horizons.\nIt is all about perception - the appearance of a new, vigorous administration, determined to hit the ground running, brimming with goodwill towards some of the UK\u2019s most important partners.\nAfter an evening spent with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock - the two found time to watch a few minutes of England\u2019s European Championship quarter-final - Mr Lammy\u2019s tour moved to the bucolic surroundings of the country estate of Poland\u2019s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski.\nAfter a couple of hours of talks, it was back on the plane for a short flight north to one of Nato\u2019s newest members, Sweden.\nWhy Germany, Poland and Sweden?\nPartly because of Ukraine. Along with Britain, all three countries play important roles in sustaining Kyiv\u2019s war effort. With the new Defence Secretary John Healey on the ground in Odesa, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government is keen to stress that the UK\u2019s commitment to Ukraine will remain rock solid.\nFollowing a meeting with President Zelensky and his counterpart Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, Mr Healey said the UK would provide more artillery guns, a quarter-of-a-million ammunition rounds and nearly 100 precision Brimstone missiles.\n\"There may have been a change in government, but the UK is united for Ukraine,\" he said, promising to \"reinvigorate\" support via increased military aid.\nHe also pledged to fast-track the reinforcements to ensure they arrive with the next 100 days. \n\u201cWe want to double down on our commitment to Ukraine,\u201d Mr Lammy said, as dragonflies swooped over a tranquil lake and a pair of majestic eagles circled overhead.\nFrance, in the midst of its own election - one which seems destined to have far-reaching consequences - was not on the itinerary. Not this weekend.\nNo stop in Brussels, either. Sir Keir has said the UK will not return to the EU \u201cin my lifetime\u201d.\nBut Poland and Sweden are both key European partners and fellow Nato members - good places for the foreign secretary to start exploring the outlines of closer future relations.\n\u201cI want to reset both our bilateral relationship and our relationship with the European Union,\u201d Mr Lammy said, adding a reference to Labour\u2019s still rather nebulous pledge to strike a new EU-UK security pact.\nMeanwhile, on a visit to Edinburgh on Sunday, the prime minister said work was already under way to improve the UK's relationship with the EU.\nHe said his government \"can get a much better deal than the botched deal that Boris Johnson saddled the UK with\".\nMr Lammy said that when European leaders gather at Blenheim Palace on 18 July for the next meeting of the European Political Community (established by Emmanuel Macron in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine), \u201cthe new spirit of co-operation will be on show\u201d.\nThe trip comes just days before Sir Keir takes his own first steps on the international stage as prime minister, at the Nato summit in Washington DC.\nThese are tricky times to be shoring up relationships, with France taking a lurch to the right and the US possibly on the verge of returning the unpredictable Donald Trump to office.\nMr Lammy agreed this was a \u201ctough geopolitical moment\u201d, but said it was important not to confuse disagreements between mature democracies with the threats posed by authoritarian regimes.\n\u201cI am concerned when I see Iranian drones turning up in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI am concerned when I see shells from North Korea being used here on European soil. \n\"And of course I'm concerned with the partnership that I see Russia brokering across those authoritarian states.\u201d\nOther issues hang heavy over the new foreign secretary\u2019s first trip, in particular the war in Gaza.\nIn Germany on Saturday, Mr Lammy spoke to the need to strike a \u201cmore balanced approach to Israel-Gaza\u201d.\nIt is not clear exactly what he meant, but with ceasefire talks apparently poised to resume, finding a way to end the Gaza war and revive the Arab-Israeli peace process seems destined to consume a large amount of diplomatic time in the coming months.\nFor his part, Mr Lammy\u2019s famously anglophile host said the relatively new Polish government shared something in common with the incoming Starmer administration.\nBoth, Mr Sikorski said, were \u201cthe product of the public being tired with enthusiasts on the nationalist side of politics\u201d - a remark which perhaps only partially reflected the true nature of last week\u2019s general election.\nMr Sikorski said he looked forward to \u201ca more pragmatic approach\u201d from Britain to its relationship with Europe and said the two ministers had discussed \u201csome creative ideas of how to further that\u201d.",

    "The commissioner appointed to oversee major cuts needed by Birmingham City Council after it effectively declared bankruptcy has warned there is \"more bad news to come\".\nThe authority has to make at least \u00a3300m in savings and sell off assets worth \u00a3750m before April 2026.\nMax Caller said it was \"slow progress\" and the council was behind target.\nCampaigners want the new government to intervene and save services that are under threat.\nThe council has already announced the sale of community centres and is considering how many libraries and day care centres it will have to close.\nLead commissioner Mr Caller, appointed by the former government to oversee the authority's recovery, said the council had to go faster to meet its goals.\n\"They've got a lot to do to generate next year's savings proposals, but we think there is the opportunity for them to promote savings where that will improve services rather than reduce them,\" he said.\n\"It takes time for all the bad news to come out, but they're on that right path.\"\nHe said in the past there had been a lack of honesty within the council, which had prevented its problems from being addressed.\n\"Now that is starting to change, now we are starting to find what's really been going on,\" he added.\n\"The council has got to balance its books - that's what the law requires.\"\nProtesters gathered outside the council house on Tuesday as the campaign against the proposals continued.\nFull-time carer Jean Cross, 64, is fighting to save Harborne Day Centre from closure.\nHer brother Robert Mason has been going there for 43 years, since it opened. \nMs Cross, from Edgbaston, said: \"If Robert doesn't go to another day centre that's my life finished. It's a 24-hour job, seven days a week. I only get five hours a day as it is.\"\nThe 62-year-old is severely disabled and attends the centre five days a week. Not only does it get him out the house, he gets to meet other people and is taken on trips, his sister said.\n\"It's very stressful and I'm pretty young. I've got 80-year-old carers on the phone to me crying because they are that stressed out at their time in life,\" she said.\n\"They are picking on the most vulnerable. Robert is peanuts. Carers are cheap labour. The silent army that trundles on day after day, under the radar and we just get on with it.\"\nShe called on the new Labour-led government to do more for the \"unsung heroes\".\n\"It's about time they started looking after us.\"\nRamandeep told the BBC in February of her fight to keep her son Harry's school transport.\nThe 16-year-old has Down's syndrome and special educational needs and has relied on a council-funded taxi to get to school since he was four years old.\nShe has since found our Harry will instead be given a free disabled person's bus pass.\nRamandeep, from Sutton Coldfield, said: \"I don't see that it's going to work. The expectation is that he will use that pass to get to and from school, which would involve two buses and travelling on his own along busy main roads. \n\"Harry doesn't have the ability to do that. He can't travel alone. He would not be safe at all without an adult being with him.\n\"I can't put my child's life at risk.\"\nIf the council rejects an appeal, the options for Harry are to leave school or for Ramandeep to give up work so she can take him to the specialist school 10 miles away from their home.\nShe described the issue as a \"national crisis\" and a \"scandal\".\n\"It is happening up and down the country. Politicians not paying attention to it. This is scandalous what is happening to youngsters,\" she said.\n\"It feels like these tiny little cohort of students are the ones who are facing the axe.\n\"Harry has a right to an education and it's being taken away from him.\"\nKate Taylor, organiser of campaign group Brum Rise Up, called on the new government to make more money available to local authorities.\nShe said: \"We've got a huge amount of people who are really seriously impacted by the cuts.\n\"We are hoping the government recognise this is a national crisis. I don't believe we can't find the money. These people who use these services are absolutely at the bottom, there's nothing left for them. We've got families falling apart.\n\"The money has to be found.\"\nBirmingham City Council said it faced a significantly challenging financial situation and has to make \"considerable budget savings\" across its services.",
    "Life expectancy in parts of northern Lincolnshire remains \"stubbornly low\", with too many residents \"old before their time\", according to health officials.\nThe claim was contained in a preamble to a health report produced by Diane Lee, director of public health for northern Lincolnshire.\nMs Lee suggested poor diet was now the biggest risk factor to preventable ill health, adding the cost of living also had an impact on the choices people were able to make.\nThe report was presented to North East Lincolnshire Council's health and wellbeing board on Monday.\nAccording to \u00a0data from Public Health England (PHE)\u00a0, deprived areas had five times more fast food outlets than affluent areas.\nIn her report, Ms Lee said: \"Where we live can influence our food choices, we are surrounded by food outlets, and evidence shows that those who live in our more deprived communities have fewer options to buy healthy options.\"\nAccording to data from the Office for Public Health Improvement & Disparities (OHID), North Lincolnshire had an obesity rate of 37.1%, with North East Lincolnshire at 34.7% - well above the England-wide average of 25.9%.\nThe report made a number of recommendations to tackle the issue, including supporting families in need with healthy food and ensuring wellbeing was at the \"forefront\" of any decision-making regarding future developments.\nOther recommendations included ensuring families who were eligible to access free school meals were automatically enrolled and work in schools to improve oral health.\nChampioning walking and cycling to improve health and reduce air pollution for cars was another recommendation, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nOther issues highlighted in the report included plans to tackle social isolation.\nAlso discussed at the meeting, was the Humber and North Yorkshire Health Care Partnership\u2019s strategy, which includes an ambition to increase healthy life expectancy in the region by five years by 2035.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "From the exit poll, to the White House balcony - it has been quite a week for Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe prime minister is clearly revelling in his new role, with his nine years in opposition over.\nHe headed to Washington for the Nato defence alliance summit, his government not yet complete, news of ministerial appointments pinging into my inbox as we zipped over the Atlantic.\nFrom hustling for votes one week to high diplomacy the next is quite the fortnight - and perhaps one an incoming government wouldn\u2019t choose in an ideal world.\nBut while governing provides the capacity to shape much, that doesn\u2019t extend to shaping the scheduling of international summits.\nThe Nato summit in the American capital has been in the diary for months.\nWhoever had been prime minister would have been turning up, election or not.\nSo, no matter that jobs still had to be allocated and Sir Keir himself had only just been sworn back into parliament, the airport beckoned.\nAnd so began an attempt to turn the scheduling logjam to their advantage.\n\u201cIt was great to have the ability to see so many leaders here in the first full week in office,\u201d one senior prime ministerial aide told me.\n\u201cIt shortcut a process that could otherwise have taken months to get round everyone. \n\"It meant we could make the most of the momentum coming out of the election and while there was maximum interest in Keir to raise all the strategic issues we wanted to and reset from our predecessors.\u201d\nThe prime minister sought to place his \u201cunshakeable\u201d commitment to Nato within the Labour tradition.\n\u201cI represent the party that was instrumental in creating Nato 75 years ago. \n\"It was a Labour prime minister, Clement Attlee, and a Labour foreign secretary, Ernie Bevin, that fought so hard to make this a reality. \n\"This is our history - we are proud of it,\u201d he told us in his closing news conference.\nHe added that the alternative to Ukraine\u2019s victory was \u201cunthinkable.\u201d\nBut the issue that is dominating the national conversation in the US - President Biden\u2019s future - was catapulted to prominence again when the 81-year-old confused the leaders of Ukraine and Russia, of all places, just moments before the prime minister\u2019s own news conference.\nWith President Zelensky standing just yards away, President Biden managed to introduce him as President Putin.\nAt the end of a Nato summit dominated by the war in Ukraine, and a few weeks dominated by questions about President Biden\u2019s mental capacities and political future, it was about as bad a gaffe as you could possibly imagine.\nThere were audible gasps in the press room as the words were uttered. Reporters from all over the world were dumbstruck at what they had just heard.\nMoments later, Sir Keir Starmer went from witnessing that cripplingly embarrassing moment to facing repeated questions on it.\nEarlier, when the prime minister had done a series of interviews with the travelling British press pack, me included, he had been asked about his impressions of the president, having spent about an hour with him, for the very first time, the day before.\nHe was, in essence, a character witness to this raging debate, in the United States and around the world, about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry on and run for re-election this autumn.\nSir Keir told me President Biden had been \u201con really good form\u201d and \u201cacross all the detail.\u201d\nExcept this latest evidence suggested he really wasn\u2019t.\nSir Keir stuck to this formulation repeatedly - that the President Biden he had seen had achieved much at the conference to be proud of.\nWhat else could he really say?\nBut the truth is Nato\u2019s attempt to project a united, steadfast alliance its members can believe in has been shaken by yet another wobbly moment from the leader of its most powerful member.",
    "An exhibition of art that Hitler tried to ban is to go on show at a Norfolk festival.\nThe Holt Festival, in North Norfolk, is hosting a collection of works titled German Expressionists & The Third Reich from this weekend.\nIt features paintings that were deemed \"degenerate\" by the Nazi dictator, and includes an artwork owned by Stephen Fry's mother, Marianne.\nThe painting was damaged when her stepmother's family fled Austria as border guards using bayonets stabbed the packing case to check people were not being smuggled out of the country.\nJames Glennie, co-curator, said: \u201cNot only is it an exhibition with some spectacular pictures in it by some of Europe\u2019s most important and expensive artists, it tells a slightly grim story.\n\"But there are some colourful highlights, that allow one to enjoy that grim story.\"\nMr Glennie showed two catalogues promoting touring exhibitions staged by Hitler. One promoted works he approved of; the other featured art he considered \"degenerate\".\nMr Glennie added: \u201cYou\u2019ll notice that the degenerate [catalogue] one is thinner, has more modern stuff in it. \n\"The key thing is that around five million people went to this [the degenerate exhibition] and well under half a million people went to this [the art Hitler was promoting].\"\nCentral to the collection in the hall at St Andrew the Apostle is an image owned by Marianne Fry, mother of the actor, author and broadcaster Stephen Fry.\nHer stepmother, Claire Grabscheid, was a young lawyer in Vienna during the Anschluss, when Hitler's regime annexed Austria. Her family fled, paying fees to take some of their possessions with them to England.\nAt the border, guards stabbed the packing case with a bayonet, checking no people were being smuggled out of the country, damaging the painting of a Dutch girl.\nMr Glennie added: \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily unusual in the sense that many people would have thought it\u2019s a damaged painting and either disposed of the painting because it\u2019s not the greatest work of art ever, but also it might have been something that made them unhappy. \n\"They don\u2019t celebrate it, but being thinking people they decided the best thing to do was to keep it so that it showed the aggression of the Anschluss.\u201d\nNic Stratton Tyler, co-curator, said: \u201cHitler had very strong views on art. He was a failed artist himself and architecture student. \n\"He didn\u2019t like the German expressionists. They were avant-garde. They were gregarious. They were saying all the wrong things. He liked classical art and realist art.\"\nOf the Holt exhibition, she added: \u201cI hope that it will be a very informative exhibition. We hope it\u2019s going to ask a lot of questions. Answer and ask perhaps, but I always think art that makes people think is really important.\u201d\nThe exhibition, which features graphic images of war and violence, opens on Saturday 13 July and is open every day until Sunday 27 July.\nThe festival organisers say children aged under 12 should be accompanied by an adult.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Taoiseach Simon Harris has spoken to the new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer by phone.\nThe Taoiseach told his Fine Gael party in a private meeting on Wednesday that he was making plans to seek an early engagement with the new British government. \nDuring the call on Friday, Mr Harris congratulated Sir Keir on his new role and his party's victory in the election.\nThe taoiseach said \"he looked forward to having a close and constructive working relationship\".\n\"We both agreed on the call that it is so important that we now have a reset moment in Anglo-Irish relations and that both he and I would lead on that,\" Mr Harris said.\n\"I think the relationship between the taoiseach and the British prime minister is so key in terms of Anglo-Irish relations.\n\"I am determined now to throw myself into that with vigour and energy.\"\nMr Harris accepted the prime minister's invitation to visit Downing Street on 17 July. \nThe taoiseach and the prime minister spoke of their determination to \"reset and strengthen\" the bilateral relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  \nThey also discussed Northern Ireland - welcoming the restoration of the Institutions.\nThey also discussed legacy issues.\nThe taoiseach also welcomed the appointment of Hilary Benn as secretary of state for Northern Ireland.\nSimon Harris and Sir Keir Starmer both agreed \"a closer relationship between Dublin and London was needed\" and regular engagement between them would be required.\nThey have agreed to start work on that immediately and to stay in close contact.\nAfter years of strained relations, Simon Harris said the election provided an \u201copportunity and major moment\u201d to reset relations with the Republic of Ireland's nearest neighbour.\nSpeaking before the UK general election, Mr Harris said he did not want to foreshadow who would be successful but was keen to hit the ground running.\nHe said this was in order to forge stronger relationships between the administrations on both sides of the Irish Sea.\nThe taoiseach told TDs (MPs) and senators it was timely to seek \u201cearly engagement to discuss close, good relationships, between Ireland and the UK, in a post-Brexit environment\".\nThere has previously been tension at times between London and Dublin in recent years.\nThe British government's Legacy Act was opposed not only by the Northern Ireland political parties but also repeatedly by the Irish government.\nIts introduction on 1 May meant an an end to historical inquests and the transferring of Troubles-era cases to a new body.\nThe act's most controversial element, the offer of conditional immunity to suspects, has been disapplied following legal action by bereaved families.\nThe court ruled this part of the act was incompatible with human rights' legislation and the Windsor Framework.\nBrexit negotiations also caused some tension on the relationship between London and Dublin.\nAnd, there have been tensions over asylum seekers.\nEarlier this year, the Irish government complained of a significant spike in the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland from Northern Ireland.\nThe Irish government argued the UK had a duty to take them back.\nBut, the then prime minister, Rishi Sunak, ruled that out.\nSir Keir Starmer is the first Labour leader to oust a sitting Conservative government since Tony Blair\u2019s landslide victory in 1997.\nThe new prime minister has promised change on a manifesto to \"rebuild Britain\" after 14 years of Conservative rule.\nMr Starmer trained as a barrister, specialising in human rights cases, and was director of public prosecutions from 2008-13 before becoming an MP.\nHe frequently describes himself as being from a \"working class background\".\nHis dad was a toolmaker and his mum worked as a nurse.\nSimon Harris is also relatively new to his role having become taoiseach earlier this year.\nHe took over the role after Leo Varadkar announced he was stepping down in March 2024.\nMr Harris was elected after a vote in which 88 D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) members supported him while 69 voted against his appointment.",
    "A former Labour minister has broken her silence over her sudden sacking by Vaughan Gething in May.\nIn a dramatic statement, Hannah Blythyn told the Senedd she has never leaked to the media.\nThe first minister had alleged that she was the source of a story which revealed Mr Gething told ministers he was deleting messages from a pandemic-era group chat.\nBut the Labour Member of the Senedd (MS) for Delyn said she was not shown any evidence before she was sacked, was not told she was being investigated, and that the situation left her with acute anxiety and stress.\nSpeaking as Mr Gething watched from the front of the chamber, Ms Blythyn said \"kinder\" and \"better\" people were needed to improve politics.\n\"I know that I can look all my colleagues who sit on these [Labour] benches in the eye and say that I have never leaked or briefed the media about any of you,\" she said.\nMs Blythyn's speech was met with applause - some members tapped their desk, including Mr Gething's former leadership rival Jeremy Miles.\nThe Welsh government has declined to comment.\nMs Blythyn was absent from a vote of no confidence that Mr Gething lost in May - colleagues said she was off work sick.\nShe began her speech on Tuesday by saying there had been times where she was unsure \"I would or could stand or speak\" in the Senedd debating chamber again.\n\"Whilst I will not share the detail, I will share that I have formally raised concerns about the process by which I was removed from government, including not being shown any alleged evidence before being sacked, not being made aware that I was ever under investigation and that at no point was I advised or was it evidenced that I may have broken the ministerial code.\"\nMs Blythyn said she recognised it was \"within the gift of any first minister to appoint and remove members of their government\".\nBut in a possible reference to the circumstances around the death of the sacked Welsh government minister Carl Sargeant, the MS said she had \"very real concerns that lessons have not been learned from the past\".\nShe said there had been \"speculation about my circumstances and whether I have been well enough to work\".\n\"This has ranged from what was tantamount to misinformation, and what can be put down to misunderstanding.\n\"It should not be surprising that what happened has been hugely detrimental to me on a personal level, and led to acute anxiety and stress.\"\n\"I have never been signed off work  and I have struggled with this in itself, but there was a point when the thought of just putting my camera on to vote and seeing you literally took my breath away.\"\nReferring to a BBC radio programme called Broken Politicians, Broken Politics, which Labour colleague Lee Waters contributed to, she said: \"I am not broken, but I now know more than I did before that I am breakable, as actually we all are.\n\"We've talked about often in this place a kinder politics - but we cannot have a kinder politics without kinder people.\n\"We won't get to better politics without being better people.\n\"It has been a privilege to serve in my country's government, particularly under the leadership of Mark Drakeford.\"\nShe added that a \"younger me who struggled with her sexuality would never ever have believed that one day I would spearhead plans to make Wales the most LGBTQ+ friendly nation in Europe\".\nThe personal statement from Ms Blythyn was a surprise addition to the Senedd agenda coming before a statement on Mr Gething's legislative programme.\nShe had denied leaking to the media at the time of her sacking.\nOn the day the decision was announced, Mr Gething said: \u201cHaving reviewed the evidence available to me regarding the recent disclosure of communication to the media, I have regrettably reached the conclusion I have no alternative but to ask Hannah Blythyn to leave the government.\n\"The government has offered ongoing support to the member.\"\nHe said there was a \"route back for her to take up a government position again in future\".\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Ms Blythyn\u2019s comments \"raise more questions for the first minister\".\n\u201cPeople will now rightly ask whether the first minister publicly sacked Hannah without sufficient evidence that she was guilty of leaking,\" he said.\n\u201cThe personal consequences for Hannah of that sacking were clearly enormous, and the first minister owes her a full and humble apology.\u201d\nPlaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth wrote to Mr Gething urging him to publish the evidence supporting his sacking of Ms Blythyn.\nHe called on the first minister to make an \"urgent statement in the Senedd tomorrow setting out your response to the concerns raised in today's personal statement by the member for Delyn\".",
    "Nestle has committed to keeping production of KitKats in York after upgrading the factory where the famous chocolate bars are made.\nThe Haxby Road plant was taken over by the Swiss food manufacturer in 1988 and now employs 2,000 people.\nMore than a billion KitKats are now produced in the city each year on the site of the original Rowntree's factory.\nYork had a proud history of chocolate-making, with both Rowntree's and Terry's operating large factories in the city in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nNestle's factory manager Kevin Shrimpton told BBC Radio York that \u00a322m had been invested in machinery at the plant over the past three years.\nMr Shrimpton said: \"We've upgraded the five rapid machines, to allow us to operate at a much higher speed than we were previously.\"\nSome of the York workforce feared for the site's future after Nestle announced in 2022 that it was closing its confectionery factory in Newcastle.\nAt the time the GMB and Unite unions said 475 jobs would be lost at Fawdon, where Fruit Pastilles were made, and 98 at the York factory.\nNestle instead committed to improving Haxby Road to increase production of KitKats, which were invented in York in 1935.\nWhen asked whether Nestl\u00e9 intended to stay in York, Mr Shrimpton said: \"Very much so.\n\"We employ nearly 2,000 people on the campus, 700 in the factory, so we're a really big part of the York infrastructure.\n\"York is also the home of the global product technology centre for confectionary, so all the product development we do happens here in York.\n\"Having the factory right next door is a huge advantage.\"\nMark Davies, Managing Director for Nestl\u00e9 Confectionery UK and Ireland, said about the York site: \"It's really vibrant, 2,000 people - there's a lot going on.\n\"And we just keep putting investment in because you can trust the workers, there's a great workforce in York.\"\nThe site also makes chocolate for the production of Quality Street, and uses around 12,000 tonnes of cocoa every year.\nThe ingredients are sourced responsibly from family farms in Ghana and the Ivory Coast that are part of a Nestle scheme to reduce child labour.\nRowntree's was founded in York in 1862 by a Quaker family. By 1890, the company  had acquired the Haxby Road site to expand production. \nBetween the wars, Rowntree's launched lines such as Aero, Polo mints and Smarties after abandoning attempts to compete with Cadbury's in the milk chocolate market.\nAfter the Nestle takeover in 1988, production of Rolos, Yorkie bars and Easter eggs was moved to York from Norwich, but there were hundreds of job losses at Haxby Road in the 2000s when Smarties manufacture was transferred to Germany.\nThe York factory remains one of the world's largest confectionery plants.\nRowntree's local rival, Terry's of York, had its 1920s-era Chocolate Works site on Bishopthorpe Road. It was closed by Kraft in 2005, and the buildings have been redeveloped.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "A driver who killed a baby boy and his aunt in a horror motorway crash has been jailed for more than 17 years.\nDarryl Anderson, 38, was drunk and taking pictures of himself driving at more than 140mph when he crashed on the A1(M) in County Durham on 31 May.\nEight-month-old Zackary Blades and Karlene Warner, 30, who were passengers in the car he rammed into, were killed instantly, Durham Crown Court heard.\nAnderson, from Rotherham, who admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, initially told police his Audi Q5 was being driven by a hitchhiker he had picked up.\nProsecutor Emma Dowling said Zackary's mother Shalorna Warner had taken her sleeping son with her when she went to collect her sister Karlene from Newcastle Airport in the early hours of 31 May.\nAnderson, of Clarell Walk in Thorpe Hesley, had also arrived at Newcastle Airport from a holiday which his wife had left early due to his \"erratic behaviour\", Ms Dowling said.\nHe collected his Audi Q5 from the airport where a staff member smelled alcohol on him.\nAnderson told the worker his wife had left him on holiday but he was going to Bradford to get another one, Ms Dowling said.\nDue to roadworks on the A1, southbound traffic was diverted through the centre of Newcastle where cameras showed Anderson was about five minutes behind the Peugeot he would crash into.\nWitnesses on the Felling Bypass said he was was speeding and overtaking cars, with one person saying he was driving like a \"bloody idiot\", Ms Dowling said.\nAt 03:17, about four miles south of Chester-le-Street, Anderson slammed into the back of the Peugeot while taking a picture of himself driving at more than double the 70mph speed limit, the court heard.\n\"The back of [Ms Warner's] vehicle was so crushed there was no longer a back to the vehicle,\" Ms Dowling said.\nShalorna Warner said they were in the car chatting about her sister's holiday when \"all of a sudden there was an ear-splitting bang\" and the vehicle was spinning.\nShe said the back of her car was \"completely crushed\" and \"gone\" and she faced a frantic search to find her son until a lorry driver spotted him lying in the road.\nMs Warner said he had been flung 164ft (50m) and suffered catastrophic injuries, while her sister had broken almost every bone in her body.\nJack Blades, Zackary's dad, said there was \"no chance in hell they were coming out of there alive\".\nAnderson himself emerged unscathed from the wreckage and told police at the scene he was sorry, before a breath test found he had 95mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mcg.\nHe was taken to hospital as a precaution where he was \"joking\" and \"flirting\" with nurses, the court heard, and refused to give a blood sample as he claimed he was afraid of needles, despite his many tattoos.\nAnderson declined to comment in his first interview, then gave officers a \"wholly false account\" that he had picked up a hitchhiker who was driving his car, Ms Dowling said.\nHe also told police he was \"sorry people had died\" but it was \"not nice for him to witness\" and he \"hoped the police would catch the driver\".\nOfficers did investigate his claim, but could prove he was the driver as his DNA was found on the steering wheel airbag.\nMs Dowling said he had previous convictions including for drinking and driving in 2006.\nZackary's parents said their son was just starting to stand up by himself and had been saying \"mamma\".\nMs Warner said it did not feel real and it was like \"living someone else's nightmare\".\nShe said Anderson had been \"cocky and arrogant\" and it was a \"measure of who he was\" that he only thought of himself.\nMs Warner's parents Nigel and Alison said there was an \"emptiness\" for them and their other two daughters.\nAlison Warner said Anderson \"decided to kill people\" through the choices he made and had fired a \"bullet\" right through the heart of their family.\nNigel Warner told the court Anderson was a \"vile man\" who was \"driving a killing machine\", adding his daughter and grandson had \"no choice about what was to happen to them\".\nJudge Joanne Kidd said Karlene Warner was an \"exceptional\" daughter, partner and friend on the cusp of a whole new chapter in her life\", while Zackary was \"so cherished\" and a \"beautiful addition\" to the whole family.\nShe said the picture Anderson took of his dashboard before the crash was \"chilling\", while photographs of the aftermath were the \"stuff of nightmares\".\nJudge Kidd said Anderson, who had travelled about 20 miles (32km) of his intended journey, \"played Russian roulette with the lives of every man, woman and child\" he passed, adding his \"aggressive and entitled\" driving made a catastrophic collision with other people inevitable.\nAnderson was jailed for 17 years and three months, banned from driving for 21 and a half years and will need to pass an extended test before he can apply for a licence.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Miriam Margolyes said transforming a Victorian public baths into a new centre will offer young people a \"whole new world of arts\".\nOn Friday, the actor visited the Grade II listed Jacobs Wells Baths in Bristol, which will re-open as a dance and arts centre in 2025. \nSpeaking about the \u00a31.6m restoration, Ms Margolyes said: \"I think one of the most important things in the world is to make life better for young people. \n\"Here's a place that really can help young people who live around here.\"\nIn March, the site was granted \u00a356,895 from Historic England for emergency repairs before the main work began.\nJacobs Wells opened in 1889 when it was used as a bathhouse for the poor, and closed in the late 1970s.\nTrinity Community Arts has taken on a 35-year guardianship lease of the site.\nMs Margolyes, who is touring with her show Oh Miriam!, which include a date at Bristol Beacon later, was an early supporter of the restoration project.\nThe celebrated actor said the idea of the Victorian building being torn down \"disturbed\" her.\nShe told the BBC: \"I've been working with Trinity for quite a while, they are a terrific local organisation and they've done so much good work. \n\"I just think if I can do anything to help restore an old building and make it useful for the community in ways that people are going to enjoy using, I better get off my bum and do it.\" \nThe actor met with the Trinity team and workers from PH3 Design, who have developed the recently-approved restoration scheme.\nUnder the proposals, a street-facing main entrance, a new cafe-bar and studio will be built. \nMs Margolyes, who is a patron of Trinity, added: \"When you come into a space like this, I always think 'theatre! Theatre! Performance!' because that's what's made my life worth living, but it can be many things because it's so huge. \n\"There is so little to help enjoy life, to find a kind of spiritual happiness.\n\"This would provide a whole new world of arts and movement and life. \n\"It's important, it's the next world - it's what I'm going to leave when I die. But it's got to go on, and this will make it go on.\" \nTrinity\u2019s chair of trustee\u2019s Chris Luffingham said: \u201cWe\u2019re so grateful for Miriam taking the time to visit the project and this comes as we complete key milestones including securing planning and lease completion.\" \n Trinity will now begin on the \"crucial phase one repairs\", which includes work to the main hall roof. \nHe said the achievement within the last year was \"testament to the collaborative efforts\" of everyone involved.\nMr Luffingham added he was \"excited\" to bring the building back into use as a \"multidisciplinary venue for arts, heritage, youth, community and educational use\".\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Pam is used to poverty and desperation, but she\u2019s never known it this bad. She runs the Rock Foundation Food Bank in Grimsby. \u201cWe are feeding 800 people a week, it was 300 five years ago,\u201d she says.\nThe food bank is in a derelict public toilet, and the food is passed out through a small hatch. \u201cAt another food bank someone pulled a knife out,\u201d Pam explains. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it in a way that we can shut it down quickly if anything was to happen.\u201d\nWe counted at least six food banks in this square mile of East Marsh, which is home to 10,000 people. It\u2018s not only one of the most deprived wards in Grimsby, but also in the top 1% of most deprived places in all of England, on almost every single metric - income, employment, health, crime and education.\nThe average household income here is just \u00a322,200. The average years a man could expect to live in good health has just dipped below 60 years.\nOne woman at the food bank, struggling to walk, shows me her fruit. How important is this to you, I ask her. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have it, I wouldn\u2019t eat.\u201d\nAs well as the food bank, Pam gives out warm meals, free haircuts and advice on benefits. It\u2019s like a shadow welfare state, but one that relies on goodwill. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, you feel so desperate,\u201d she says.\nEach bag is meant to last three days, but they can\u2019t give out as much food as they used to, she says. \u201cWe\u2019re just putting a sticking plaster on what the real issues are.\u201d\nJust around the corner on Freeman Street, vaping shops line up alongside cafes and newsagents, but you cannot help but notice the boarded-up shops. The town\u2019s commercial vacancy rate is nearly three times the English average - more than one in four premises here are empty.\nIt\u2019s in stark contrast to the days when Grimsby had a thriving fishing industry and port. Sitting outside the food bank is Patrick, off work with ill health. He has witnessed decades of decline, and he is despondent. \u201cEverything has gone and been destroyed - the fishing, the farming, everything\u2019s gone.\u201d There\u2019s an election coming, so I ask: can politics fix this? No, says Patrick. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone and not coming back.\u201d\nPam also says she has \u201czero faith\u201d in politicians. \u201cIt\u2019ll be us who fixes this, the charities,\u201d she says. I ask Pam who she will vote for, but she says she doesn\u2019t know. \u201cWho do you trust?\u201d she wonders.\nWe meet Jessica walking home after buying a bit of food for her children, Isabelle 3, and Lucas, who is 18 months. Jessica is a full-time mum living on Universal Credit, and money can be tight. \u201cI go without so my kids are fed,\u201c she says. \u201cI'm not able to provide everything my kids want but I'm able to provide what they need. They are missing out on school trips because I've got more important things like food and stuff to pay for.\u201d\nJessica isn\u2019t struggling alone in Grimsby, where about one in four children live in poverty, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nI ask Jessica when was the last time she went out by herself, a night out or cinema? She pauses, and guesses it was over a year ago. \u201cIt brings you down. You feel isolated.\u201d\nShe hopes when they are older, her children won\u2019t have to struggle, \u201cI want Lucas to be able to thrive and be able to achieve anything he wants to and Isabella, my eldest, to achieve everything that she wants in life, be happy and live every day without worrying about the world.\u201d\nThe poverty we saw in Grimsby is acute but not unique. Across the UK, there are around 1,700 food banks, and the number of parcels delivered by one of the leading providers, the Trussell Trust, has doubled since the last election to over three million.\nYet there is investment coming, and change is under way. The town has received \u00a320m of government money for a new leisure complex including a five-screen cinema and a market hall at Freshney Place. The renewable energy sector has also brought new life to the port, employing about 2,000 people, and many of those are skilled jobs with the potential of higher wages.\nSpades are in the ground, but it will be a while yet until it is finished. And many of the high-end engineering jobs are out of reach of local people. Change doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\nPhilip Jackson, the leader of North East Lincolnshire Council, says there are job opportunities and skills training for young people, but despite the changes, many local residents do not feel connected to them.\n\u201cWe do have a messaging problem. People do not see the windfarms, they can\u2019t see over the fences into the port.\u201d There\u2019s work to do, he says, to make all of Grimsby feel included.\nOn Freeman Street we meet Dom, 29, with a handful of Xbox games. \u201cI\u2019ve pawned these games, I\u2019ve just bought them back.\u201d He explains that he got about \u00a35 for them, to pay for food, but had to pay more to get them back.\nDom says that he\u2019s struggled for a long time, but the cost of living crisis broke him. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, I\u2019ve been made homeless three times this year.\u201d\nHe says he had a zero-hours contract in a fish-packing factory, but his shifts went",
    "Clandestine hospitals in the Philippines have been offering plastic surgery services to fugitives and scam centre workers to help them evade arrest, authorities say.\nTwo such illegal hospitals could be shut down \"in the coming weeks\" after police raided the first one in Manila's southern suburbs in May, a police spokesman told the BBC.\nHair transplant tools, dental implants and skin whitening IV drips were seized from the hospital in Pasay City two months ago.\n\"You can create an entirely new person out of those,\" said Winston John Casio, a spokesman for the Presidential Anti-Organised Crime Commission (PAOCC).\nThe two illegal hospitals under surveillance are believed to be four times larger than the one in Pasay, authorities said.\nTheir clients allegedly include those from online casinos, who are working in the Philippines illegally, Mr Casio said.\nThe online casinos or Pogos (Philippine Online Gaming Operations) cater to players in mainland China, where gambling is illegal.\nBut police say Pogos have been used as cover for criminal activities such as telephone scams and human trafficking.\nThree doctors - two from Vietnam and one from China - a Chinese pharmacist, and a Vietnamese nurse were arrested in the Pasay raid, none of whom were licensed to work in the Philippines.\nAuthorities also found a hemodialysis machine, suggesting that the facility, which was about 400 sqm, offered various medical treatments in addition to plastic surgery.\n\"They look like regular clinics on the outside, but once you enter, you'll be shocked by the type of technology they have,\" Mr Casio said.\n\u201cThese Pogo hospitals don\u2019t ask for the proper identification cards... You could be a fugitive, or you could be an illegal alien in the Philippines,\u201d he said.\nAuthorities were tipped off on the existence of the illegal hospital in Pasay City.\nPogos flourished under former president Rodrigo Duterte, who sought friendly ties with China during his six-year term that ended in 2022.\nHowever, his successor Ferdinand Marcos Jr has mounted a crackdown on Pogos, citing their criminal links.\n\"The president does not want the Philippines to be painted as a 'scam hub' and has given us a directive to go after scam farms because of how they have been targeting large numbers of people from all over the world,\" Mr Casio said.\nIn December 2022, immigration officials arrested a suspected Chinese mafia member who allegedly underwent plastic surgery to evade detection. Such cases may be linked to the underground hospitals, Mr Casio said. \nThe mayor of a sleepy town north of the capital, Alice Guo, recently came under fire after a Pogo scam centre was busted near her office.\nShe has also been accused of being a spy for China after authorities questioned her birth records.",
    "A woman who was threatened and controlled by a \"depraved\" rapist while working as a sex worker has said she has been left \"destroyed\". \nNicholas Moxham, 52, has been jailed for at least 19 years after being convicted of a series of sex offences against women and children.\nHe had persuaded sex workers to move in with him and then abused, raped and filmed them.\nColette, who has waived her right to anonymity to speak to the BBC, said Moxham threatened to break her neck and left her \"questioning everybody, everything.\"\nThe judge at Manchester Crown Court told Moxham, of Heaton Chapel, Stockport, that his offences \u201cwere designed to satisfy your own deviant and selfish sexual desires\".\nThe trial heard how he lured six women to his home in the early weeks of the first Covid lockdown, in March 2020, by persuading them he could move their sex work businesses online.\nHe went on to rape some of them in their sleep, control their finances and threatened them into carrying out \"disgusting and degrading\u201d sex acts for him and others. \nCollette told BBC North West Tonight Moxham approached her on the street in Manchester and offered to help her.\n\u201cIt was great at first, he was harmless, he was just taking me to get the drugs I was smoking, he was letting me take clients to his house,\" she said. \nMoxham booked appointments for the women, invited clients to his house as well as another house in Longsight, Manchester. \nHe then used spyhole cameras and cameras hidden in pens to film the encounters.\nThe jury heard how Moxham would encourage or coerce his victims into performing other sexual services online, and \u201cdirected\u201d some of his victims in pornographic videos. \nCollette said his demands became increasingly degrading but he would make threats if they refused to do them. \n\u201cReally you couldn\u2019t say no because it was out on the streets or Nick\u2019s way,\" she said.\n\u201cIt made money for him and the things he was asking were going too far.\n\u201cHe threatened to break my neck, tell my family, I was also on bail at the time and he threatened to get me arrested.\"\nShe added: \"It destroyed me.\n\"He\u2019s just left me numb. It\u2019s left me questioning everybody, everything.\"\nThe trial heard how Collette and the other women fell into a spiral of debt after Moxham began to charge them for staying at his house and they were told to work off what they owed by taking more appointments. \nIn May 2020, Collette left his house after she learned Moxham had raped her in her sleep, something she later found out had happened before and he had filmed the attack. \n\u201cThat man thinks he\u2019s untouchable, he think\u2019s he\u2019s above the law,\u201d Collette said.\nAnother victim read out her impact statement at the hearing, telling Moxham: \"You made me feel dirty, exposed and hurt.\u201d \n\u201cNow I don\u2019t believe anything and I don\u2019t trust anyone\u2026 I\u2019ll be alone for the rest of my life because of you.\"\nMoxham was arrested in a raid on his home in August 2021. \nDet Sgt Lee Attenborough said his hard drive contained \u201chuge catalogues\u201d of covertly recorded material, some of which showed him raping women while they were unconscious.\nHe said Moxham \u201ctreated his victims like a possession, like something that he owned\".\nThe sentencing hearing heard Moxham earlier admitted sexual offences against children who were attending laser and go-kart events at a school in Manchester, organised by a company he ran.\nHe used a camera hidden in leaves to film himself abusing three children separately during 2016 and filmed children in the toilets between 2018 and 2019, the court heard.  \nJudge Potter said none of the children who had been filmed or abused by Moxham had been traced by police. \nThe court heard Moxham's offending had started decades earlier when he was detained for four years in 1992 after wounding a woman.\nThat attack was motivated by \u201canger issues towards females due to their disinterest\u201d in him, the judge said.\nMoxham also received a caution in 1997 for indecent exposure.\nThe judge said his offences were \u201ctargeted to exploit the vulnerability of others you preyed upon \u2013 be they sex workers addicted to drugs or children entrusted into your care\u201d.\nMoxham was found guilty of 32 offences, including rape, controlling prostitution for gain, slavery and sexual assault. \nHe had earlier admitted further offences, including sexual assault of a child under 13, making and taking indecent photographs of children and keeping a brothel used for prostitution.\nHe was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 19 years.\nListen to the best of\u00a0BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The things they see. The dead girl lowered by a rope from a ruined building. She sways slightly, then comes to rest, legs folding beneath her on the rubble.\nThey see people and parts of people lying out in the open where the blast or the bullet caught them. Violent death in all of its contortions.\nBodies lying in the streets, in the blasted open sitting rooms of houses, under the rubble. Sometimes covered by so much concrete the men will never reach them, and only in the future when the war is over will somebody come and give them a decent burial.\nThe men of the Gaza Civil Defence cannot close their eyes to any of this. There is no shutting out the smell. Every sense is on alert. Death can come from the skies in an instant. \nWhen the fighting in places like Shejaiya in eastern Gaza City, or Tal Al-Sultan, near Rafah, in the south, is as fierce as it has been in the last few days, the ambulances of the Civil Defence dare not venture out.\n\u201cEntering areas close to the Israeli occupation is dangerous, but we try to intervene to save lives and souls,\u201d says Muhammed Al Mughayer, a local Civil Defence official.\nHe and his men seize any lull in the conflict to recover the dead and the wounded. Families constantly ask about missing relatives.\n\u201cIt is very difficult to identify the bodies,\u201d explains Mr Mughayer. \u201cSome remain unidentified due to complete decomposition.\u201d \nStray animals also prey on the corpses, tearing off clothes and scattering papers that might be used to identify them.\nThe ambulance crews are short of fuel. Two days ago one broke down in Tal Al-Sultan and had to be towed out, a nerve-wracking experience for the crews. The risk of being fired on by the Israeli forces, says Mr Mughayer, means seriously injured people often cannot be rescued.\n\u201cThere is currently a report of an injured person near Al-Salihin Mosque from two days ago, but we can't reach them due to delays in coordination. It may result in their death.\u201d\nRefugees are continuing to flee from Gaza city and areas like Shejaiya. Many have been displaced multiple times. \nFor them it is a world without laws or rules. World leaders express concern. But nobody is coming to rescue them. Nothing is more acute for these people than the sense that they can die at any moment.\nSharif Abu Shanab stands outside the ruins of his family home in Shejaiya with an expression that is part bewilderment, part grief.\n\"My house had four floors, and I can't enter it,\u201d he says. \u201cI can't take anything out of it, not even a can of tuna. We have nothing, no food or drink. They bulldozed all the houses, and it is not our fault. Why do they hold us accountable for the fault of others? What did we do? We are citizens. Look at the destruction around you\u2026\n\"Where do we go, and to whom? We are thrown in the streets now, we have no home or anything, where do we go? There is only one solution and that is to hit us with a nuclear bomb and relieve us of this life.\"\nThere are occasional glimpses of reprieve. The Al-Fayoumi family, arriving close to Deir Al Balah in central Gaza, were relieved to have escaped from Gaza City. This after a warning this week to evacuate from the Israel Defense Forces sent thousands of people onto the road south.\nIn the boiling heat of the asphalt road, without shade, family members were reunited with others who had gone ahead of them.\nThe new arrivals were given water and soft drinks. A boy sucked from a carton of juice, then squeezed it with all his strength to coax out a last few drops.\nNobody in the group took their survival for granted. So to see everyone alive, all in the one place, brought smiles and cries of happiness. An aunt reached into a car to hug her young niece. At first the child smiled. Then she turned her head and sobbed.\nWhere will they be tomorrow, next week, next month? They have no way of knowing. It depends on where the fighting moves next, on the next Israeli evacuation order, on the mediators and whether Hamas and Israel can agree a ceasefire.\nThese lines could have been written at any time in the last few months. Civilians dying. Taking to the roads. Hunger. Hospitals struggling. Talks about a ceasefire.\nSince February, we have been following the story of Nawara al-Najjar whose husband Abed-Alrahman was among more than 70 people killed when Israeli forces launched an operation to rescue two hostages in Rafah. \nThey had fled Khan Younis 9km (6 miles) to the north, and took refuge closer to Rafah when bullets and shrapnel tore through the tented camp where they slept.\nNawara was six months pregnant when she was widowed, and taking care of six children, aged from four to 13. When a BBC colleague found her again today, Nawara was nursing her newborn baby, Rahma, just one month old.\nShe gave birth on a night of heavy airstrikes, rushed to the hospital by her in-laws.\n\u201cI kept saying: \u2018Where are you Abed-Alrahman?

    "A surgeon who left patients in \"agony\" made a number of failures, a tribunal has found. \nBristol-based surgeon Tony Dixon, who used artificial mesh to treat prolapsed bowels, failed to obtain informed consent, adequately investigate symptoms and failed to trial alternative treatment methods, a report said. \nThe General Medical Council (GMC) brought the case against Mr Dixon, who treated more than 200 patients at Southmead Hospital and Spire Hospital. \nMr Dixon denies all the allegations and maintains that the procedures were carried out in good faith, and any surgery can result in complications. \nReports made from 2010 to 2016 were considered as part of the tribunal, led by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. \nThe BBC first revealed allegations made against Mr Dixon in 2017, when many women complained of severe pain following their operations. \nTwo years ago, a review by Southmead Hospital found that 203 mesh operations carried out by Mr Dixon were deemed to be unnecessary, and non-surgical treatments should have been offered instead. \nMr Dixon used a technique known as mesh rectopexy to treat bowel problems. \nThrough the procedure, mesh implants are placed into the body to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence in women - both conditions which can occur after childbirth. \nThe mesh, which is usually made from synthetic polypropylene, is intended to repair damaged or weakened tissue. \nSam Van Der Heijden, from Hastings, East Sussex, was treated by Mr Dixon at Spire Hospital in 2011. \nThe tribunal found that he carried out a manual examination for rectal prolapse without a chaperone present, before failing to properly advise her of the risks of an operation that was carried out to resolve issues arising from her initial procedure.\nMs Van Der Heijden said: \"Because he was the so-called expert, I just went along with it.\n\"For a few months I was okay, but then it got worse.\"\nMr Dixon told Ms Van Der Heijden that her colon was \"dead\", prompting another major surgery to remove it. \nShe now lives with a stoma bag, and has developed pancreatic insufficiency, as well as bile acid malabsorption. \n\"My health is [not], and will never be like it was before,\" Ms Van Der Heijden said.  \n\"It\u2019s had a really bad knock-on effect to my whole system - I\u2019m constantly exhausted, dehydrated, not absorbing properly\u2026 the list is endless.\"\nShe described Mr Dixon as a \"very cruel man\" with \"no compassion\" and \"no empathy\" for his patients. \nJennifer Hill, from Bristol, was also left with life-long pain and stomach problems after undergoing mesh surgery at Spire Hospital. \nThe procedure was carried out in 2012 to treat her irritable bowel syndrome.\nShe told the BBC: \"It was soul destroying. I was in extreme pain. \n\"I was always having diarrhoea, I was constantly bloated and too poorly to think about anything. I was left with pain and flatulence which he completely dismissed after the operation.\" \nThe tribunal also found Mr Dixon made inappropriate references to Mrs Hill's sex life to her husband.\n\"I still have nightmares, I still kick myself for believing him,\" she added. \nThe tribunal cleared Mr Dixon of patting a woman's bottom in a hospital lift.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A former teacher has been banned from the profession after sending messages to a police officer posing as a 14-year-old girl.\nA misconduct panel found the conduct of 35-year-old Steven Millar, who taught at Cheltenham Bournside School and Sixth Form Centre at the time, was \"sexually motivated\".\nMr Millar's actions were uncovered by an officer who posed as a teenager on an instant messaging website between 25 and 26 January 2021.\nThe school said it expected staff to \"maintain high standards of ethics and behaviour at all times\".\nAccording to a Teaching Regulation Authority report, Mr Millar messaged who he thought was a 14-year-old girl called Dais from Aylesbury on a platform called Chatiw on 25 January.\nWhen the \"girl\" told him her name and age, Mr Millar replied \"cool x\" under the profile name \"Teach on free\".\nHe asked her for details of what she looked like, followed by a request for a picture and her Snapchat. He also messaged her a sexually-explicit demand.\nThe messaging ended when Mr Millar was asked by the undercover operative whether he was teaching later that day, the report said.\nThe officer sent a further message the following day saying \"helloooooo lol\u201d that received no response.\nOn 11 March 2021, Mr Millar was arrested on suspicion of sexual communication with a child aged 14 on an instant messaging platform.\nThe police concluded six months later there would be no further action after an investigation, the report said.\nGloucestershire Police said it did not want to comment any further on the case.\nMr Millar stopped being employed by the school on 1 November 2021 after a disciplinary investigation.\nIn a statement provided by Mr Millar as part of the disciplinary hearing, he said he \"deeply regrets being involved in a matter that has given the school cause for concern and he apologises for any problems caused by his actions\".\nThe panel said in the report Mr Millar had \"insight into his wrongdoing\".\nA spokesperson for Cheltenham Bournside School said: \"Our expectation is that staff uphold public trust in the education profession and maintain high standards of ethics and behaviour at all times. \n\"Our safeguarding training, policies and processes are clear to protect everyone in our community.\n\"The member of staff involved was immediately suspended when we were made aware of the allegations by the police and they did not return to school at any stage before he was formally dismissed. \n\"The offence took place away from the school site and did not involve any members of our school community.\"\nThe misconduct report said: \"It is necessary to impose a prohibition order in order to maintain public confidence in the profession.\" \nThe school received a 'good' rating after Ofsted's inspection in September 2022.\nAt the time the school had 1,707 pupils enrolled ranging in age from 11 to 18.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "By Friday, we'll know who's won the general election. But over the course of the campaign, parties in Scotland have made all sorts of claims in an effort to persuade voters to back them. The areas they've covered include health care, public spending and the environment.\nWe examined some of the claims.  \nThe SNP have often repeated the claim a Labour government would cut \u00a318bn from public spending.\nThis figure came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank earlier this year.\nHowever, the think tank has since suggested cuts could range from \u00a310bn to \u00a320bn and stressed there is uncertainty around the figure, because no spending plans have been published beyond next year. \nPublic spending overall is due to rise over the next Parliament and Labour has said it will stick to the broad outlines of the Conservatives\u2019 current spending plans.\nBut because they have already committed spending to the NHS, defence and new childcare entitlements, other departments look set to lose out.\nThe extent of the squeeze on \"unprotected\" areas depends on what choices are made for other public services. \nThe SNP say this is evidence Labour would continue with Tory \u201causterity\u201d.\nHowever, an improvement in the economy could make these cuts unnecessary \u2013 or the next government could find a way to raise more tax.\nHolyrood\u2019s block grant is determined by the overall level of spending on public services at Westminster - which is rising in real terms by 1%.\nThe Scottish government can also raise income tax to make up for what it sees as a block grant shortfall.\nThe Scottish Conservatives want to show themselves as the party of the oil and gas sector but their manifesto repeats a now discredited figure around the future of jobs in the sector.\nIt claims that Labour and the SNP are putting 100,000 Scottish jobs at risk by not fully backing future exploration licensing - something which the Tories support.\nBut the reality is that the North Sea is a declining industry and so jobs are continually being lost.\nThe industry's own figures show that, at present, it employs about 60,000 people in Scotland, directly and indirectly. \nEven when jobs in the wider economy  - such as hospitality and retail, whose customers earn their crust from oil - are added in, that figure only rises to 83,000.\nResearch from Robert Gordon University says that even in the best-case scenario, 33,000 oil and gas jobs will go by the end of the decade in the UK.\nIn the worst case, that number increases to 60,000. \nThe difference between the best and worst-case scenarios is 27,000 oil and gas jobs - and that's across the whole UK, not just Scotland.\nWhere the Conservatives agree with the other parties is on the need to ensure a fair energy transition for workers.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar's claim that 40% of hip and knee replacements are being done privately is correct - the figure comes from Public Health Scotland.\nIn 2022 in Scotland, 11,175 hip and knee operations took place, of which about 4,600 were carried out at private hospitals.\nData from the Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN) shows that more than 3,000 hip replacements and 1,500 knee replacements were carried out privately last year.\nThat is either through patients self-funding their care or through insurance claims.\n2023 saw record levels of private admissions (up 11% on the previous year).\nThe Nuffield Trust says in Scotland, there has been an 80% rise over the past five years in people paying out of their own pocket for healthcare.\nHowever, the increase was higher in Wales (up 124%) - where Labour run the devolved administration which controls the health service - and in Northern Ireland (218%).\nEngland - where the health service has been under the control of the Conservatives - saw a rise of 20%. \nRelative to its population, England continues to have the highest number of patients going private. \nThis suggests that wherever you live in the UK, growing numbers of patients are taking matters into their own hands and paying for healthcare to avoid long waits on the NHS.\nLabour has said if it were in government it would make use of \"spare capacity\" in the private sector to cut NHS waiting lists in England (NHS funding would be directed to private providers so it remains free for patients).\nBut organisations including the Nuffield Trust have questioned whether the overall health budget will increase enough to make the recovery Labour are promising achievable.\nBecause health is devolved, it is up to the Scottish government to decide how to spend its budget and the SNP - who are in power at Holyrood \u2013 say they oppose further privatisation.\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrats claim 20,000 tonnes of \u201craw sewage\u201d was \"pumped into Scotland\u2019s rivers and beaches\" last year.\nIn 2022, there were around 20,000 incidences (rather than tonnes) of sewage being released into Scotland\u2019s rivers and seas.\nThis happens when heavy rainfall causes sewers to overflow. \nThe manifesto contains an acknowledgement that the s",
    "A piece of amber worth an estimated \u00a3750 has been taken from a tourist attraction during a fossil-digging experience for children. \nThe gemstone, which is about 40 million years old,  went missing from the event at Stump Cross Caverns, near Pateley Bridge, on Saturday.\nOwner Lisa Bowerman said she had contacted the parents of children who attended to ask them to \"check their kids' pockets\", but no-one had come forward. \nShe said the Baltic amber was \"palm-sized\" and had a fly trapped inside, which made it more valuable.\nFossil digs are held regularly at the caverns, which lie beneath the Yorkshire Dales, where artefacts are planted for young participants to find. \n\"We do a fossil dig and we tend to take in quite a lot of really expensive, interesting, unique fossils,\" Ms Bowerman said.\n\"I like the children to hold them, to touch them and to see them, and it's normally things that you wouldn't get chance to see, things that would normally be behind glass.\"\nShe said there were 47 people at Saturday's session and they all handled the amber - which is essentially fossilised tree sap.\nWhen one of her staff members went to collect the items at the end, the amber was gone. \nShe added: \"I was hoping that a little person had taken it thinking, 'Oh, this is lovely!' and then the parents would think, 'Oh my goodness, we didn't mean to do that!', so that it would just be an honest mistake really.\n\"Obviously the price tag is important, but to me it's the educational value because we show it to so many people and it's so important for me to let them get close up to things and learn hands on.\"\nIt is the second time a precious item has been taken from the caverns, after the fossilised tooth of an extinct shark was stolen last year. \nThe megalodon tooth was taken from a fossil dig event in February but the culprit, an elderly man, was caught on CCTV and when he realised, returned it. \nMs Bowerman said: \"I think his conscience got the better of him as he didn't realise that we'd actually seen it on CCTV.\"\nThe man returned the tooth by throwing it from his car towards the caverns, and it broke in two. \nMs Bowerman said this time she may not get her precious item back. \n\"I think maybe somebody has just taken the opportunity to take it, because otherwise I would have expected it back by now,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Tucked in the corner of a park in Brixton, south London, a dog day care is making a difference. \nPaws and Pause, a social enterprise, has helped people recovering from addiction and mental illness back into employment. \nIt takes on trainees for six months to help them develop their CVs and employability while they work alongside the dogs.\n\"It's given me a sense of belonging more than anything,\" says Shancy Collett-Nanton, who has completed the trainee programme.\n\"When you're working with dogs you're part of a pack,\" she said. \nMs Collett-Nanton said she was working at a food bank in 2019 when the pandemic hit, and the stress of the job led to her suffering a breakdown.\n\"It was a lot. It was getting very, very stressful,\" she said.\n\"The constant listening to people's struggles every single day, day in, day out. And in the end basically I had a breakdown.\"\nAfter completing the trainee programme at the dog day care centre, Ms Collett-Nanton went on to work for the social enterprise full-time. \nAmy Deeprose, who also completed the programme at Paws and Pause, said her autism diagnosis and caring for her mother before she died had prevented her from being able to commit to a job long-term. \n\"When you've been out of work for a long time you often feel very separated,\" she said.\n\"In society, we tend to take the measure of success as 'oh they're back at work, oh they're doing great'.\n\"It's very hard then to go from being a service user to just going back to work.\"\nNow she is also employed by the social enterprise and has been a member of the team for the past couple of years.\nFounders Jodie Larsen and Grace Beards started the social enterprise after working for homelessness charity St Mungo's.\nThere, they say they saw first-hand the \"power\" that working with animals can have.\n\"Working with animals can increase a person's ability to connect, learn and feel confident\" said Ms Beards.\n\"That's why we're looking to scale up our trainee programme.\"\nShe said the organisation received referrals from organisations across London, including mental health services and substance use services.\n\"We have a really long waiting list, which is why we're doing a crowd-funder at the moment,\" Ms Beards added.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Four West Midlands MPs are among a record number of Sikh MPs elected or re-elected at the recent general election, according to a Labour MP.\nPreet Kaur Gill was the first Sikh woman to be elected to the Commons when she initially won the Birmingham Edgbaston seat in 2017.\nShe told BBC Radio WM it was a privilege and an honour to take up the role and to see more Sikh MPs in Parliament.\nShe said there was still a lot to do, however, to better serve the British Sikh community.\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely brilliant to see a record level of Sikh representation in Parliament, the Labour party now has 11 Sikh members of Parliament,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere is lots to do for the Sikh community \u2013 one of the biggest issues is the inequalities that they face across public services.\u201d\nSonia Kumar, who has been elected to the newly formed Dudley constituency, said she was pleased that young Sikhs now had more role models.\n\u201cRepresentation really matters,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you look up you want to see people in those positions and feel like you\u2019re able to attain those as well.\u201d\nShe hoped pictures of the 11 standing together in parliament would inspire others to stand for election in the future.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just really honoured, really privileged to all be elected and we can\u2019t wait for the next few weeks ahead to start our journey,\u201d she said.\nShe added that the staff in Parliament had been helpful and understanding with the new cohort.\nWolverhampton West MP Warinder Juss said his first few days had been like a whirlwind.\nHe similarly praised the friendly and welcoming reception new MPs had received from staff in Westminster.\n\u201cMy immediate priority is to set up an office in Wolverhampton, get staff in and start helping constituents as I\u2019ve always wanted to do.\u201d\nMPs needed to be representative of their constituency, he said, adding that Wolverhampton had a significant Sikh population.\nMr Juss represents the constituency formerly represented by Enoch Powell, who  supported a ban on Sikh bus drivers wearing turbans to work in the 1960s.\nHe said: \u201cIt is a great honour. To be a Sikh, to be a turban Sikh, as an MP.\u201d\nHe said the big challenges people raised while he was canvassing included crime and antisocial behaviour, the cost of living and education \u2013 and that he would work for people of any faith or none.\nGurinder Josan was also elected this July to represent the Smethwick constituency, having won almost half of the share of votes.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really moving that I, a child and grandchild of immigrants, can be elected as MP for this area today,\" he commented following his victory.\nThere was also a record number of Muslim MPs elected this year, according to the Labour Muslim Network.\nAmong them in the West Midlands are Zarah Sultana for Coventry South, Shabana Mahmood for Birmingham Ladywood and Tahir Ali for Birmingham Hall Green and Moseley.\nAlso among the Muslim MPs elected in the West Midlands is independent MP Ayoub Khan for Birmingham Perry Barr.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Simon Cowell is desperate to find \"the next Zayn\" in music.\nThe X Factor and Britain\u2019s Got Talent boss reckons \"the amount of UK artists breaking globally have fallen\".\nThose thoughts have led to him launching a search for the next big UK boyband - and Simon thinks being in a group can help artist's solo dreams.\nZayn started out as a part of One Direction - a group created on The X Factor in 2010 - and the Pillowtalk singer has since won multiple awards and made global impact as a solo artist, including in the US and among South Asian communities.\n\"For whatever reason, in the last 10 years or 12 years, there hasn't been one [boyband] from the UK which is crazy,\" Simon told BBC Asian Network's Haroon Rashid.\n\"I've always said to young people if you can get your mates together and form a band, it will give you a better shot.\n\"Rather than just posting your own stuff. As a solo artist online, the market is so crowded right now.\"\nSimon's search will form part of a Netflix show, with the first set of auditions taking place over the weekend in Liverpool, and more scheduled in Dublin and London.\nThe queue in Liverpool did not see an overwhelming rush of people, instead a steady number of hopefuls who were optimistic of their chances.\nOne of those was Corvin Kelly who came from Scotland to \"pursue my dream of being a pop star\".\nThe 16-year-old told Newsbeat he\u2019s a huge fan of 1D and Harry Styles in particular, and hopes to emulate him.\n\"I dream of filling arenas. I\u2019d love to do that, make music videos and have fans.\"\nHe wasn\u2019t alone with that thought.\nFreddie Sullivan also made his way from Hertfordshire, with his parents.\n\"I just want to make it,\" the 15-year-old said, guitar in tow.\nHe takes inspiration from the Arctic Monkeys, Oasis and indie band The Royston Club.\n\"I love when it's all that raw talent. And it's not artificial.\n\"My biggest dream would be to be standing at Wembley, and hear the crowd sing my song back to me.\"\nSimon also revealed that Zayn initially struggled with nerves, but eventually \"conquered\" them.\nThe British Asian artist has broken through and made waves with both Western and South Asian audiences.\nAnd that\u2019s something Savan Kotecha is keen to find in this search too.\nThe songwriter and producer has been brought on board, and said he has \"a personal stake\" in finding acts from a South Asian background.\n\"One of the reasons I got involved in One Direction when I first met them, was the fact that Zayn\u2019s Pakistani,\" Savan, who is from a Gujarati background, told Newsbeat.\nSavan's songwriting credits include hits such as 1D\u2019s What Makes You Beautiful (about his wife), One Last Time by Ariana Grande, and The Weeknd's Can't Feel My Face.\nHe recalls his journey into the industry - starting with a childhood story of being in a high school band in the US and \"secretly\" sending out a demo tape to a record label as his family wouldn\u2019t have approved.\n\"I remember getting a call [from the label] and he said 'I like your song and everything',\" Savan said.\n\"[But] he goes 'No girl in Wisconsin will put an Indian guy on her wall, you should just be a songwriter'.\n\"So that's stuck with me for most of my life.\"\nHaving now spent a number of years in the industry and seen it evolve, Savan wants to grow the number of young South Asians in music.\nBut it comes with challenges, as creative industries are still not as common for them to follow.\n\"Why do they say be a doctor - because that's the safest path, right? They see examples of that in our culture,\" Savan said.\n\"We need to encourage parents to allow their kids to express their creativity, because it is possible. I'm an example of that.\n\"It's part of my mission at this point in my career to make sure that the 17-year-old me is represented.\"\nHe said that \"unless people can start young\", it\u2019s not possible to \"get our version of Beyonc\u00e9 and Michael Jackson\".\n\"The UK has historically had so much talent, it's been a great place for boy and girl groups.\n\"I think it's an amazing time to do it, and they're more than just pop music. To me, it's about building community.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "At least five people have been killed by a Russian drone and missile strike on the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, officials say. \nA further 53 people were injured in the blast early on Wednesday morning, regional head Serhii Lysak wrote on Telegram. Officials said shops, schools and hospitals were damaged by the strike. \nMr Lysak described the attack as \"vicious\". Footage shared on social media showed a large plume of smoke and fire erupting from buildings after the blast. \nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack and renewed his appeal to Western allies to supply his government with further air defence systems. \n\"Only two things can stop this Russian terror \u2013 modern air defence systems and the long-range capabilities of our weapons,\" he wrote on social media. \nDnipro, a city with a pre-war population of about a million people, has been a frequent target for Russian attacks since the war began over two years ago. Last year, 40 people were killed after a Russian missile slammed into a residential  apartment building in the city. \nUkraine's air force said it downed six drones and five out of seven missiles which had targeted the city early on Wednesday. \nBut images posted by Mr Lysak after the barrage showed buildings ripped open in the city centre, with glass shattered and strewn across the ground. \nGeorgii, an elderly witness sporting a bandaged nose and bloodied face, told the Reuters news agency: \"There was such a strong explosion that the wave hit me and I fell.\" \nAmong the injured was a 14-year-old girl, Mr Lysak said. Four other people in serious conditions were being treated at hospital, he added. \nThe head of the regional council, Mykola Lukashuk, condemned what he called an act of \"cynical terror\" by Russian forces. An official day of mourning has been declared by city officials. \nElsewhere, two civilians were killed in overnight strikes in eastern Ukraine, officials in Donetsk and Luhansk have said. In Kharkiv, one person was killed and eight more injured - including an eight-year-old boy - in a Russian bombing raid, local prosecutors said. \nRussia has intensified its aerial attacks on Ukraine in recent months. While Moscow denies targeting civilian infrastructure, the UN's human rights monitoring mission said May was the deadliest month for civilian casualties in almost a year.\nPresident Zelensky has issued increasingly urgent requests for new air defence systems in that time, urging his allies in the West to ignore Russian threats that such actions could trigger an escalation of tensions. \nOn Tuesday, he met Hungary's Prime Minister, Victor Orban, who has just taken over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union. \nMr Orban has long been Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has frequently criticised EU aid packages for Ukraine. The men's body language was not warm during the tense meeting in Kyiv, with Mr Orban urging Mr Zelensky to seek a ceasefire and expedited peace negotiations. \nElsewhere, Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday that it had captured a key district in the hilltop settlement of Chasiv Yar. The small town in eastern Ukraine has been at the centre of intense fighting for months. \nThe town, which has been flattened by endless shelling, is viewed as a potential staging ground for Russian forces as they advance on the remaining Ukrainian-held areas in the Donetsk region. \nKyiv has yet to comment on the claims. \nMeanwhile, Ukraine's military intelligence agency has said it was behind a fire which broke out on a Russian warship in the Baltic Sea in April. \nGUR spokesperson Andriy Yusov told Reuters that the agency had targeted the Serpukhov missile ship, operating in tandem with a pro-Kyiv group called the Freedom of Russia legion. \n\"As a result of the sabotage, [we] managed to ruin the ship from inside and completely destroy communication and its means of automation,\" the legion said on its Telegram account.\nIt comes as Moscow claimed Ukraine carried out three drone strikes on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday. The plant's Russian management said several workers were injured in the attack. \nThe UN's nuclear watchdog - the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - called the attacks a \"a threat to nuclear safety and people\u2019s lives\", adding that they \"must stop\". \nKyiv has yet to comment on the accusations. The plant has been under Russian control since March 2022 and has come under frequent attacks, with both sides trading blame. ",

We can't wait to take our four boys home to Lauren and Hunter.\"\nJohn said: \"Life is going to be a bit noisier for all of us but I'm really looking forward to us being one big family.\"\nArlene was closely monitored throughout her pregnancy because of risks associated with multiple births, such as premature delivery and pre-eclampsia.\nShe added: \"Having quadruplets is a high-risk pregnancy and at every scan, I was really anxious that there wouldn't be four heartbeats.\n\"The midwifery team were absolutely amazing, they really supported me every step of the way.\"\nA team of 17 doctors and midwives delivered the quadruplets in the Simpson's Centre for Reproductive Health at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.\nMs Mitchell underwent a planned Caesarean section when she was 30 weeks pregnant.\nEach baby had an individual team of four clinicians assigned to look after them.\nAt first, the boys were each given intensive care in the neonatal department to help stabilise their breathing and allow them to grow while they were tube fed.\nHarrison and Rory were later moved to the special care baby unit at St John's Hospital, Livingston, to be closer to their family, before Ben and Noah joined them.\nKaty Ruggeri, NHS Lothian associate director of midwifery, said: \"Delivering quadruplets is an extraordinary experience and I am immensely proud of our entire midwifery and neonatal team for their dedication and expertise throughout this remarkable journey.\n\"This was the first set of quadruplets delivered in Lothian and it's something the entire team will remember for the rest of their careers.\"\nThe boys are now thriving and the family are preparing for the big move home.\nArlene said: \"Welcoming quadruplets into the world has been an incredible and overwhelming experience.\n\"It's going to be a very different house and probably a bit noisier but we're so looking forward to taking our babies home.\"",

    "There was not enough evidence to suggest power lines proposed near a city that would carry energy from offshore wind farms would be required by 2030, a council said.\nChelmsford City Council raised concerns over National Grid's plan to build a 114-mile long (184km) power line from Tilbury in Essex, through Suffolk and on to Norwich. The previous government set a target of doing this by 2030.\nLiberal Democrat councillor Rose Moore said the Lib-Dem controlled council understood the need for clean energy, but thought plans could impact the landscape. \nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero previously said: \"Securing Britain's clean energy future requires improving outdated infrastructure.\"\nThe city council said the plan would have \"harmful landscape impacts, potential for harm to residential amenity and in particular the harm to designated heritage assets\".\nIt said there was \"significant concern\" regarding the impacts on heritage sites in the villages of Little Waltham and Great Waltham.\nThere was also significant concern that the archaeological remains of an Iron Age settlement could be affected.\nThe council's preferred strategic option would be to use offshore technology instead of onshore power lines.\nMs Moore, cabinet member for Greener and Safer Chelmsford, said: \"Please be assured that while the need for this clean energy\u00a0transition is fully understood, it's proposed that the city council maintain\u00a0our objection in principle to the use of onshore pylons and power lines.\n\"We object because insufficient evidence has been provided to show these power lines are needed by 2030 and that the accelerated program of\u00a0consultation has taken the project outside of the scope for what we call holistic network design.\"\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero added: \"National Grid has put the Norwich to Tilbury proposals out for public consultation and like all infrastructure, these proposals would be subject to a rigorous planning permission process.\"\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

And I'm gonna win!\"\nAs he left the stage, the strains of Tom Petty's hit I Won't Back Down washed over the high school gymnasium, an implicit rebuff to the growing list of elected members of his party exhorting him to step aside amid concerns about his age.\nBut for all the headlines dominated by the latest politician, donor or liberal actor to turn on Mr Biden, a longer list of Democrats are sticking by him.\nAt least 80 Democratic politicians have publicly backed the 81-year-old, and more are joining them as he insists he is going nowhere. \nTo many, his political record, his principles and his 2020 victory over Donald Trump mean more than the damage of a rambling performance in any debate or public appearance, or health fears during a new four-year term.\nIn Mr Biden's first solo news conference of the year on Thursday, he gave detailed responses on Nato and his plans for a second term, but many headlines focused on his flub in referring to his deputy, Kamala Harris, as \"Vice-President Trump\".\nHis allies - for now, at least - praised the embattled commander-in-chief's performance, which was watched live by over 23 million people - a bigger audience than this year\u2019s Oscars.\n\"I thought he showed a real command of foreign policy, really extraordinary,\" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told reporters on Friday. \"I don\u2019t think Donald Trump can talk about foreign policy coherently for one minute.\"\nGavin Newsom, the California governor touted as a possible successor, told CBS he was \"all in\" for Mr Biden, adding that there was \"no daylight\" between them.\nCongressman Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania said Mr Biden \"showed he knows a million times more about policy\" than Trump, \"the convict conman\".\nExperts say these politicians have a host of reasons for their support, including Mr Biden's record in office, his 2020 victory against Trump and the gamble of putting in a new candidate so close to the November election. \n\"The president has made it clear he wants to continue to run, and I think people are being very respectful of that,\" said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist.\n\"And it's also true that in our system, replacing a candidate for president this late is hard and is unprecedented, and so there's enormous reticence about making a big change.\"\nHe added that there was a \"healthy debate\" about who the nominee should be.\nHowever, a range of groups have said that the candidate should be Mr Biden, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has about 40 members, and the 60-member Congressional Black Caucus, which Mr Biden met earlier this week. \nAmeshia Cross, a former Obama campaign adviser, said that the black caucus, as well as many black voters, see Mr Biden as a president committed to civil rights, unlike his rival, Trump. \n\"They understand what is at stake with a Donald J Trump presidency,\" she said. \"This is a guy who has stood against DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\" \nMr Biden has received public support from several politicians on the left, including the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who have previously criticised Mr Biden for an agenda they have said is too moderate. \nMs Cross said many recognise the risks a Trump presidency brings to civil and LGBTQ rights and climate change.\n\"These are things that matter to the progressive left, and the president has actually worked on those things,\" she said. \nTo date, most of Mr Biden's support comes from politicians running for re-election in reliably Democratic districts, rather than those who worry Mr Biden could harm their own election chances in tougher seats.\nMr Rosenberg said that the White House \"needs to be respectful of their concerns and deal with them, I think, in a far more aggressive manner\".\nEven as calls grow for Mr Biden to exit the race, the most recent poll seems to suggest that he has not lost much voter support. \nThe Biden campaign has touted a survey from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos published this week, which shows him and Trump in a dead-heat, similar to survey results from before the debate. But the poll also found two-thirds of Americans want Mr Biden to step aside. \nThe president has also lost support from some among the Hollywood elite. Actress Ashley Judd called on Mr Biden to step down in a USA Today op-ed on Friday, saying the party needed a \"robust\" candidate. Her article followed an even more damning opinion piece this week by George Clooney about Mr Biden. \nLongtime Democratic donor Whitney Tilson is the latest fundraiser to pull the plug, telling the BBC on Friday that he was increasingly confident Mr Biden would go.

    "Sam Clarke says he feels lucky to have had an early diagnosis in his fight against cancer.\nThe 51-year-old was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2015 and has undergone a stem cell transplant.\nHe told the BBC that being \"caught and signposted\" at an early stage was critically important, but something that sadly he had not always seen with family and friends.\nThe latest Department of Health (DoH) statistics show fewer than a third - 29.8% - of patients began their cancer treatment within the recommended 62 days - well below the 95% target.\n\"Access is different for everyone,\" Sam said, who lives in Bangor, County Down. \n\"It depends on your age, where you are from, but that all needs to be addressed to give everyone a quick and even platform to be seen as quickly as possible.\n\"It is very hit and miss because the person you first need to see is the GP and potentially you might not see one for weeks or maybe for a month or two.\n\"There is also the referral and getting through the system because everyone is already working so hard dealing with other cancer patients.\"\nThe latest figures show a dramatic drop in the number of people starting treatment for breast cancer within the recommended target.\nBetween January and March, only 34.1% of patients requiring breast cancer treatment were seen within 14 days of their GP urgent referral.\nFor the same period in 2023 the figure was 84.2%.\nThe ministerial target states that all urgent breast cancer referrals should be seen within 14 days.\nThe latest cancer waiting times reveal that none of the targets set by the health minister have been met.\nSarah Christie, of Macmillan Cancer Support said she believed the system was on \"the verge of collapsing.\"\n\"If we continue going down this route I think we\u2019re in real trouble,\" she told Good Morning Ulster.\nAccording to DoH, the figures should be treated with caution as Encompass - the new electronic patient record system - is still in development at the South Eastern Health Trust which has affected the data.\nSam said he was now half Welsh as his stem cell donor was from Wales and called on the public to sign up to the stem cell register.\n\"Don't let that word cancer drag you down, be positive and if you have that positive attitude those around you will be positive.\n\"Don't let it the word 'cancer' or 'sufferer' determine you, just be a fighter.\" \n\"His blood and his stem cells were grafted into me and make up my white blood cells, so my blood type ended up changing to his - it\u2019s remarkable what happens but his donation has kept me alive,\" he said.\n\"So, it\u2019s not just about chemo and radiotherapy, it is also about the public, opening up their minds to see what they can do to help those living with cancer.\"\nWest Belfast woman Maria Austin, 25, who is a classroom assistant, was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in January.\nShe feels lucky to have been given time to freeze her eggs before starting chemotherapy in her fight against cancer.\n\"The egg freezing was crucial and so important because I am still young, I want to have a family when I am older,\" she said. \nMaria said she is telling her story to highlight the importance of early cancer diagnosis and to help other young people cope with symptoms she describes as \"life changing\".\nFor Maria, early diagnosis was crucial to allow her to freeze her eggs.\nShe said she had turned her diagnosis into something positive.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of support out there for young people with cancer, the body image side effects including the weight gain and hair loss \u2013 if I can help I will.\n\"Chemo and cancer affects fertility and can put you into early menopause,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"To have that wee window of two weeks to go through fertility treatment, it was hard, it was three needles a day, but I am fortunate I had the opportunity.\" \nMaria, who underwent four rounds of chemotherapy, said at the start she kept asking \u201cwhy me?\u201d.\nShe said the constant sickness and losing her hair was hard.\n\"One day my hair just kept falling out - within four weeks I had no hair left,\" she said.\n\"That was a challenge, and I am now using wigs and headscarves. I have tried to find beauty somewhere else, so I am working on my make-up.\"\nMaria\u2019s chemotherapy has worked. A recent PET scan revealed the tumour had shrunk.\nNow she will have radiotherapy treatment instead.\nLymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when blood cells called lymphocytes become abnormal.\nNormal lymphocytes fight infection. They are part of the lymphatic system which helps protect your body from infection and disease.\nThere are two main types of lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nThe most common symptom is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit, or groin.\nCancers diagnosed in people aged between 18 and 49 in Northern Ireland have risen by 20% in the past 25 years.\nThe research carried out by Queen's University Belfast and the NI Cancer Registry compared 2019 statistics with 1993 figures, when registry rec",

    "Three newly-elected MPs said their journey to Westminster was like the \"first day of school\".\nDerbyshire went completely red on election night after Labour gained nine seats from the Conservatives and held two others.\nThe BBC followed Labour MPs Catherine Atkinson, Linsey Farnsworth and Baggy Shanker as they began their parliamentary careers in the House of Commons on Monday.\nMs Atkinson, new MP for Derby North, said: \"I can't wait to get started.\"\nMr Shanker did not have the smoothest of election campaigns. He was removed as Derby City Council leader following a vote of no confidence over a row with Derbyshire County Council regarding the Sinfin waste plant just weeks before election day.\nHe was always going to stand down if he won the seat but at the time, he said the move was a \u201cdesperate act of political opportunism\u201d by his opponents.\nHe got over the line to win the seat with a majority of 6,000 to become the new MP for Derby South.\n\"It is like [the first day of school] - that's a good way of describing it,\" he told the BBC on the train down to London.\n\"It\u2019s really exciting but it\u2019s a real honour to be heading down to Westminster to represent my home city where I was born and grew up.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been there before on visits and I see new bits of it each time I go down \u2013 I just need to get my head around a lot of it. We\u2019ve got to recruit staff, get our offices set up so we can crack on and get working really.\u201d\nHe said the weekend was \u201cbusier than he had hoped\u201d with \u201cbits of sleep in between\u201d and he had been moved by the flurry of messages from family, friends, constituents and political colleagues.\nBut Mr Shanker added he still found time to cut the grass and wash the car.\nLinsey Farnsworth in Amber Valley had arguably the biggest task in Derbyshire during the general election. She had to overturn an 18.5% swing to book her seat on the train to Westminster.\nThe seat, which includes the towns of Ripley, Alfreton and Heanor, has always elected an MP from the national governing party since the seat's creation in 1983.\nThe former Crown prosecutor was told to arrive at her count after 03:00 BST on Friday and was kept informed by activists at her count on how it was going.\nBut a phone call from a family member informed her to get to the count as they looked like they were close to declaring.\n\u201cMy brother rang my step-mum and asked where I was. He said he couldn\u2019t believe I would be late for my own count as he\u2019d seen on the BBC live blog that it could be close to declaring,\u201d she said. \n\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t late, it was planned, I was turning up at that time.\u201d\nOn the win itself, she said it was still \u201csurreal\u201d that people were calling her an MP.\n\u201cThis is an incredible honour, not many people get the opportunity to do this. It\u2019s exciting but a little bit daunting \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of work to do,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe first week is all about the admin side of things, things people might not think about, like some IT equipment, an email address so I can start on the casework and begin to help people.\"\nEach new MP is paired up with a member of parliamentary staff in a \"buddy system\", partly to ensure they don't get lost.\nThe Westminster estate stretches over eight acres, with 100 staircases, more than 1,000 rooms and three miles of passages.\nInside MPs are given security passes and offered a key for a locker, since it will be a few days before they are given offices.\nThe parliamentary security department also set up a mock front door to demonstrate the security measures MPs can install at their homes and constituency offices. These include spy holes, alarms, video intercoms and CCTV cameras.\nCatherine Atkinson previously stood as a parliamentary candidate in 2017 and 2019, losing both times.\nBut the qualified barrister was first over the line at Derby Arena on Friday morning, gaining Derby North from the Conservatives with a majority of nearly 9,000.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get started, I\u2019ll get an office and some staff because people assume when you\u2019re a candidate that\u2019s all in place, but we rely on a great team of volunteers,\" she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many basic starting points, a pass to get into the building and how to actually get around the place. But this is such a good opportunity to meet other MPs and to work with them.\u201d\nMs Atkinson said she had been grateful for the advice and support of those that came before her, especially Dame Margaret Beckett, the former Labour MP for Derby South, who is heading to the House of Lords.\n\u201cWe\u2019re so lucky to have someone we can lean on with such incredible experience and just her insight is really valuable for us,\" she said.\nLooking out to the House of Commons from Westminster Bridge, she added: \"It's an incredible feeling, it's where I get to be a voice for my city.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A left-wing coalition that was formed less than a month ago has won a shock victory at the second round of France\u2019s snap parliamentary election.\nThe New Popular Front (NPF) is a broad church of centre-left and left-wing parties ranging from the Socialists to the Greens, the Communists and the radical left France Unbowed (LFI).\nAlthough these parties have criticised one another in the past and have some key differences in their ideology and approach, they decided to form a bloc to keep the far right out of government when President Emmanuel Macron called an election on 9 June.\nThe tactic worked. Against every expectation, on Sunday the New Popular Front (NFP) won a total of 182 seats, ahead of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance.\nThe far-right National Rally, which had come out top in round one a week ago, fell to third place.\nThe NFP managed such a remarkable comeback thanks to a concerted effort by left wing and centrist parties, which saw candidates withdraw from three-way races in order to concentrate the anti-RN vote. This occurred in around 200 constituencies and changed the outcome of the election.\nThe NFP only arose out of genuine fear by leftist parties that the RN was about to seize power. \nNow that scenario has been avoided, the members of the NFP need to find ways to work together in the National Assembly - and rallying together to stop the far right from winning a majority may turn out to have been the easy part.\nCracks began to show shortly after the exit polls were published on Sunday night.\nAlthough NFP party leaders acknowledged the outcome was the result of a joint effort, they each celebrated the result on their own, and some crucial differences in how to approach the post-election phase are already starting to emerge.\nBecause the NFP did not win an outright majority, some on the left are saying their bloc will have to find support from other parties, like President Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance.\nRapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, a centre-left politician who is a rising star within the Socialist Party, has already said opponents will have to come together and make deals, as they do elsewhere in Europe.\nFrancois Hollande, the former Socialist president of France who has now been elected as an MP, has said the NFP would have to \u201ctry, if possible\u201d to form alliances with other groups \u2013 although he acknowledged this would be very difficult.\nBut Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the radical left firebrand leader of France Unbowed (LFI), has ruled out working with President Macron\u2019s camp and has instead called for the NFP to be given the chance to name its own prime minister and to govern on its own.\n\nShortly after they formed a coalition, the NFP put out a programme that included a promise to scrap the pension and immigration reforms passed by the current government, to set up a rescue agency for undocumented migrants and to facilitate visa applications.\nThe NFP also promised caps on basic goods to combat the cost of living crisis, boost housing subsidies and raise the monthly minimum wage to \u20ac1,600 (\u00a31,350).\nThe alliance said it would finance its increase in social spending through a reform of the tax system, the restoration of the wealth tax and a windfall tax on corporations.\nThe total cost of the NFP's economic programme has been estimated at \u20ac150bn (\u00a3126bn) a year.\nSome economists have warned the programme is much too expensive given the current state of France's finances. It could also set it on a collision course with Brussels. Only last month, the European Commission opened an excessive deficit procedure against France. ",

The banking term is transfer. What happened was entirely orthodox; numerous transfers from the payment platform to the Tates.\"\nOn Monday, Ms Clarke quoted from a video posted online by Andrew Tate, in which he said: \"When I lived in England I refused to pay tax.\"\nThe court heard he said his approach was \"ignore, ignore, ignore because in the end they go away\".\nThe court also heard that the brothers had \"a huge number of bank accounts\" in the UK, seven of which have been frozen.\nThe proceedings are civil, which uses a lower standard of proof than criminal cases.\nThe chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, will decide on the balance of probabilities whether the police are entitled to freeze bank accounts and assets worth \u00a32.8m belonging to the Tates and J.\nHe has said he will reserve his judgment until a future date.",

    "The trailer for Ridley Scott's sequel to Gladiator has dropped, showcasing several epic scenes, including a water battle in Rome's Colosseum and Paul Mescal being rammed by a rhino. \nAll Of Us Strangers star Mescal plays Lucius, fighting for his life as a gladiator, despite his high status as nephew of corrupt former Emperor Commodus. \nSir Ridley's first film in 2000, which starred Russell Crowe as soldier-turned-gladiator Maximus, won five Oscars including best actor.\nThe trailer opens as Lucius recalls his childhood memory, when ex-Roman commander Maximus battled his uncle in the arena.\n\"I remember that day. I never forgot it, that a slave could take revenge against an emperor,\" Lucius says, before we see him in a flashback from the first film, being dragged to safety by his mother. \nHere's a quick recap of the first Gladiator film: the plot revolves around upstanding Roman general, Maximus Decimus Meridius, who was asked to inherit the role of emperor from ailing Marcus Aurelius. \nBut Commodus murdered the emperor and took the title, before killing Maximus' family and leaving him a slave. Maximus rose up to become a gladiator, returning to Rome in order to exact his revenge. \nWorld History Encyclopedia describes gladiatorial contests as \"bloody entertainment... an opportunity for emperors to display their wealth\", where up to 50,000 spectators enjoyed \"contests which were literally a matter of life and death\". \nSome battles included wild animals - Gladiator featured tigers in the arena, while an angry-looking rhino with a bloodied horn charges at Mescal in the sequel. \nIt's fair to say the first film caused a flurry of excitement among admirers of Crowe's powerful portrayal of Maximus. \nGiven Mescal enjoyed a huge surge in his fanbase after he starred in BBC drama Normal People, it's possible his role in Gladiator II may have a similar impact. \n\nLucius is undoubtedly reminiscent of the honourable Maximus, battling from below while having a much higher purpose. \nIn the sequel, Lucius has been captured from his home far from Rome, and brought there as a prisoner.\nHe becomes a gladiator, working for Macrinus, played by Denzel Washington, who sponsors fighters much like Oliver Reed's Proximo did in the first film. \nLucius protects his birthright, saying he doesn't know where he was born, adding: \"I never knew a mother and or father.\"\n\"You will be my instrument,\" Macrinus responds. \nIt appears that the twin emperors now in place -  played by Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger - are also corrupt. We see them laugh demonically while gladiators die in their mock water battle (which did happen in real life). \nLucius's mother, Lucilla, played by Connie Nielsen in the original film as well, watches with horror while her son fights beneath her, although we don't know if she recognises him.  \nHowever we see her take him full circle, back to Maximus, by giving him a ring which belonged to the Roman general before he died.\nLike the original, the film appears to be about the corruption of power, with worthy, embattled individuals taking on the might of Rome's rulers.\nLucius favours \"strength and honour\", while another Roman general, Marcus Acacius, played by The Last of Us star Pedro Pascal, says: \"I will not waste another generation of young men for their vanity,\" alongside footage of the emperors. \nWe don't yet know enough about Pascal's character to know where his morals fully lie. \nThe trailer ends with Mescal and Pascal battling in the arena, with the gladiator looking like he has the advantage, as he holds two swords crossed over the army general's neck. \nInitial responses on X were a mixture of both positive and negative, with some people excited for the sequel, while others said it wouldn't be as good as the original.\nSome fans spotted what looked like sharks in the water battle, with filmmaker Kyle Prohaska saying: \"I'm all in on Gladiator II. I'll go just for some of those insane sequences. Sharks in the arena? A rhino? Denzel? Come on. This is definitely one of those sequels nobody asked for, but this one looks better than most.\"\nAnother post, from a user called @FilmmakerJeff, called the trailer \"underwhelming\".\n\"I hate to report that I\u2019m not a fan of the Gladiator II trailer,\" he said. \n\"Terrible music choice, nothing from it gave me reassurance that it could be even close to as good as the original, and honestly, it looks like it could be pretty good at best. My hype meter dropped a notch.\"\n\nThere was also disagreement on social media over the soundtrack, which was No Church in the Wild, by Jay-Z and Kanye West. \nOne user wrote: \"In what world does the sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator need Jay-Z and Kanye West? Stop shoehorning songs into trailers.\"\nAnother in favour though, wrote: \"That pounding hip-hop really works on the Gladiator 2 trailer. Fits so well to the era.\"\nSir Ridley, who made 2023's epic Oscar and Bafta-nominated film Napoleon, told Deadline last year that he made Gladiator II because \"econom",
    "A Palestinian activist known for organising anti-Hamas protests in Gaza has been taken to hospital after an attack by a group of masked men.\nAmin Abed, 35, was admitted in critical condition after being kidnapped near his home by five assailants on Monday afternoon.\nA well-known activist, Mr Abed told the BBC: \u201cI will not stop using my right to express my rejection of the 7 October attack.\"\nPublic dissent against Hamas has grown in recent months as residents of Gaza grow angry at the huge toll inflicted on the enclave since the start of the war. \nMore than 38,240 people have been killed, including 50 in the past day, in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, since Israel began its offensive following Hamas's unprecedented 7 October attack.\nMr Abed described being kidnapped near his house by a group of five men who were armed with guns and machetes. \nHe was taken to a semi-demolished house, beaten, and called \"an agent for Israel\" and \"a traitor\". \nThe leader of the group told Mr Abed's assailants to break his fingers so he could not again write criticism of Hamas or \"the heroic events of 7 October\". \nAfter a group of passers-by attempted to intervene, the attackers fired shots into the air and told them to stay away, claiming they were from Hamas security forces.\nEventually, the assailants left and bystanders were able to take Mr Abed to a hospital. \nMr Abed is considered a popular figure. Before the war, had been arrested multiple times for speaking out against Hamas rule.\nOn Monday morning, Mr Abed wrote a long criticism of Hamas on Facebook, accusing the group of \u201cdividing the Palestinian people\u201d and \u201cquashing their dream of a state\u201d.\n\u201cWe are tired, world,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe are really tired.\u201d\nLast week, in an interview with the BBC, he said: \u201c[Hamas] has a lot of support among those outside Gaza\u2019s border, who are sitting under air conditioners in their comfortable homes, who have not lost a child, a home, a future, a leg.\u201d\nDays earlier, he criticised Hamas in an interview with Saudi TV channel Al Arabiya. A  clip from the interview was picked up on TikTok.\nIn 2019, Mr Abed helped organise protests over the state of Gaza\u2019s economy.\nFatah, the ruling party in the West Bank and political rival of Hamas, released a statement on Monday condemning \u201cthe blatant assault on activist Amin Abed in Gaza\u201d.\nIt did not name Hamas, but said the \"de facto authorities in Gaza\" had allowed \"criminality\" to spread in the enclave and held them fully responsible for Abed's well-being.\nHamas violently ousted Fatah from the Gaza Strip in 2007, a year after winning national elections, reinforcing its power there and deepening a schism between the two dominant Palestinian groups.\nGaza\u2019s Hamas-run police force has largely disappeared from the streets since the start of the war because of being targeted in Israeli air strikes, though the group remains the official authority in the territory.\nThe BBC has approached Hamas for comment.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to its attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
    "A new pilot service to help children in Surrey with obesity is being launched, the BBC has learnt.\nThe Complications from Excess Weight (CEW) clinic will be hosted by Ashford and St Peter\u2019s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.\nSurrey Heartlands Health and Care Partnership says the service is expected to start taking referrals in the early autumn.\nIn 2022, NHS England said it was opening 30 clinics across the country, where children would receive support including mental health treatment and advice about a healthy diet.\nThe multi-disciplinary teams, which include consultant paediatricians, dietitians and psychologists, will use a holistic approach to treat children and their families.\nVicky Williams, associate director of women and children\u2019s services at Surrey Heartlands Integrated Care System, said: \u201cObesity affects one in four children in the UK and it can increase the likelihood of a child developing serious health issues.\n\"Providing support to children, young people and their families early on, and making sure they receive the ongoing support they need to prevent complications later, is a key priority for us.\" \nShe says the new service will provide specialist support to children and young people who have more complex health needs.\n\"It means that, in future, children and young people will be referred to a specialist service in Surrey, closer to home, instead of having to travel further away \u2013 so it\u2019s good news for families in Surrey.\"\nNHS Frimley Integrated Care Board  says eligible children in its area are currently being seen by consultants at the CEW clinic in Southampton. \nA clinic is also being established more locally for patients from Surrey Heath and Farnham, North East Hampshire and East Berkshire.\nNHS bosses say obesity affects one in four children in the UK and can increase the likelihood of a child developing serious health issues, such as Type 2 diabetes, liver conditions and early heart disease.\nThe latest statistics from the child measurement programme in schools found nearly 13% of children measured in Surrey in 2022/23 were living with obesity in year six of primary school.\nThe previous government introduced a tax on high-sugar soft drinks in 2018 and restrictions on where unhealthy products could be promoted in supermarkets in England. \nThe new Labour government has told BBC South East it will take action to prevent ill-health and tackle the obesity crisis head on.\nA Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe will introduce tight restrictions on advertising junk food, alongside banning children from being able to purchase sugary, high caffeine energy drinks.\n\u201cBy building a healthier society, we will help to build a healthy economy.\u201d\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook and X.

    "A row has broken out between potential Tory leadership rivals Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch after Mrs Badenoch accused the former home secretary of having a \"very public\" nervous breakdown.\nAs first reported by The Times, Mrs Badenoch used a shadow cabinet meeting to criticise Rishi Sunak, but also Mrs Braverman for making public attacks on the party during the election campaign. \nMrs Badenoch said it was a \"shame\" the discussion had been leaked and that there needed to be a \"private space\" for Conservatives to discuss their challenges. \nResponding in a social media post, Mrs Braverman said: \"I'd be interested in knowing whether Kemi thinks I'm having a \"very public nervous breakdown,\" adding the hashtag: \"We don't leak\".\nDuring the shadow cabinet meeting, held on Tuesday, Mrs Badenoch said some of her colleagues were failing to grasp the \"enormity\" of the party's general election defeat, which saw them slip to their lowest ever number of MPs. \nShe was also critical of Mr Sunak, attacking his decision to hold the election in July without consulting cabinet ministers and for leaving D-Day commemorations early. \nAfter her comments were leaked, Mrs Badenoch appeared to defend making the criticism. \n\"In government, we had too much nodding along in the room and arguments outside it,\" she said in a post on social media.\n\"That culture needs to change.  We need to be honest with one another in private, and united in the direction we take afterwards.\" \nSuella Braverman hit back in a further social media message, saying: \"Kemi, and the rest of the cabinet, should not have nodded along, as they and Rishi took the party to disaster.\n\"The refusal to take responsibility is at the root of our problem.\n\"It was not someone else\u2019s fault.\"\nSo far no-one has publicly declared that they\u2019re going to run to replace Mr Sunak, who has said he will carry on as leader as long as the party wants him to.\nTory MPs are keeping tight-lipped about who they are likely to support. \nBut any hope that the contest will unify the party will have been dashed with the very public spat between Mrs Braverman and Mrs Badenoch. \nA shadow Cabinet minister who was present at Tuesday\u2019s meeting where Mrs Badenoch criticised Mr Sunak, said: \u201cWe all know what Kemi is doing.\u201d \nAnother said at least one colleague has told her privately that she needs to be \u201cless abrasive\u201d if she wants to win over colleagues.\nOthers have been irritated by Mrs Braverman\u2019s actions. \nShe wrote an article on the eve of the general election which was highly critical of Mr Sunak. \nA speech earlier this week has also riled some Conservatives including Ben Houchen the mayor of Teesside.\nHe told Times Radio: \u201cIf the Conservative party decides to go down the route of somebody like Suella Braverman, then we can absolutely see ourselves in opposition for generations to come.\u201d\nWhile no timetable has been set out for the leadership contest there seems to be a growing consensus among MPs that a longer process would be better for the party. \nOne former Cabinet minister said they\u2019d like the party conference in October to be a chance for members to assess the merits of each candidate. \nNext week, Conservative MPs will vote on which of their colleagues should sit on the party board - the group that will decide the rules for the leadership race.\nVoting for party board membership had taken place on Wednesday but is being re-run after one of the candidates was left off the ballot paper.

    "Two married \"soulmates\" who died from terminal cancer within days of each other were able to spend their last moments together side by side.\nChris and Lynne Johnson, from Bolsover in Derbyshire, had been married for 52 years before both were diagnosed with cancer and eventually moved to Ashgate Hospice in February.\nThe hospice arranged for the pair's beds to be placed in the same room, allowing them to hold hands in Mrs Johnson's final moments.\nEight days later, Mr Johnson then died with his brother Alwyn and the couple's pet dog Tess by his side.\nTheir daughter, Julie Whittaker, has decided to now share the story and is now calling on the government to review funding so more people can access end-of-life services.\nShe said: \"Dad was there for mum's last breath. He was holding her hand, and he took so much comfort in that.\n\"Not only do all people deserve the end-of-life care that my parents received, but when patients are in a hospice instead of a hospital, it takes the strain off the NHS.\"\nMr Johnson, 76, met Mrs Johnson, 69, when he was carrying out his rounds as a milkman in Clay Cross, Derbyshire.\nMs Whittaker said: \"He was out one particular day delivering milk and caught sight of mum, every time after that he tried to make sure that he would see her. Mum knew the sort of time he'd be around and always made sure she had her best outfits on for hanging out the washing.\"\nThe couple began dating and wed in 1972, with their son Garry arriving in 1973 and Ms Whittaker in 1974.\nThey lived in the same house together in Bolsover for 47 years.\nBut in 2023, Mr Johnson became ill and was eventually diagnosed with bowel and secondary liver cancer.\nAt first, Mrs Johnson was looking after him, but in December she began showing symptoms of confusion and seizures, which turned out to be a glioblastoma brain tumour.\nThey were both given care at home before their increasing needs meant they had to move to the hospice.\nMs Whittaker said: \"They did everything together, and other than when they were at work they were never apart; they were proper soulmates.\n\"It was such a whirlwind, everything happened so quickly.\n\"If both couldn't be cared for at the hospice, it would have been so heartbreaking for us choosing who we were going to be with. Having them together gave our family so much more time with them both.\"\nEach year, Ashgate Hospice said it needed to raise \u00a311m to continue to deliver palliative and end-of-life care and support, with less than a third of its income coming from NHS budgets.\nMs Whittaker is now campaigning for a government review into hospice funding so that more families are able to access hospice care when they need it.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We want a society where every person, their families, and carers, receive high-quality, compassionate care, from diagnosis through to end of life.\n\"The government is going to shift the focus of healthcare out of the hospital and into the community. We recognise that the care system, including hospices, will play a vital role in doing this.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The chief executive of a hospital trust being investigated over maternity failings has apologised to staff after the head of the inquiry said progress had \"stalled\".\nOn Thursday, senior midwife Donna Ockenden said the trust needed to \"get back on track\" with its improvements. \nStaff at Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust bypassed leaders and went straight to the healthcare watchdog with their concerns, prompting an inspection by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in June. \nAnthony May, the trust's boss, admitted its internal arrangements for staff to raise concerns were \"not working\" and vowed to make changes. \nHe said of colleagues going to the CQC: \"I'm so sorry they had to do that, and I'd like to apologise to them because we should be picking those things up in the unit, on the ground.\n\"We've got arrangements in place for people to speak up, but clearly people don't have the confidence in them and that's the thing we're concerned about.\" \nThe CQC report following the inspection has not yet been published, but limited details shared in NUH board papers said the mix of skills among workers had been insufficient during the visit. \nResponding to the CQC's findings, Ms Ockenden said parents who had recently received maternity care under the trust had raised concerns similar to those she had heard 18 months ago, around the state of wards and a \"lack of compassion\". \nHowever, Mr May said he believed things had changed, adding the CQC's most recent feedback included \"largely positive\" responses from mothers, but accepted there was progress yet to be made.\nHe and other senior colleagues met Ms Ockenden earlier in the week and \"collectively reached a view that there was more to do\", he said. \n\"We've been accused in the past of not being open about our problems.\n\"We are being now, and with that of course there is some risk that people lose confidence in us - that's the last thing we want,\" Mr May added. \nResponding to concerns over staffing, the trust chief said he expected them to be fully staffed by September and said it was \"doing well\" at retaining staff.\nThe trust said it had recently appointed more than 40 midwives who would be starting in the coming months and that no newly-qualified midwives who had joined in the last 12 months had subsequently left. \nIt also said, in the last 12 months, it had a 33% reduction in \"bank or agency use\" in midwifery.\nIn terms of support tailored to maternity staff, NUH said it offered support from its professional midwifery advocates - practising midwives who support others - and a preceptorship scheme to help newly-qualified midwives to adapt and grow in their starting roles. \nMr May said maternity staffing levels met national guidelines, but following talks with trusts, the new chief nurse and medical director, staff were not reassured that it was enough. \nHowever, he said the trust \"had budget to staff above the national guidelines, and we're recruiting now\". \nThe chief executive said the trust had a \"good grip on what's going on but needed to find a better way of engaging with staff\".\n\"I'm sure we can change, I am absolutely sure we can,\" he added. \nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The US Supreme Court has said Donald Trump and other former presidents are partially immune from criminal prosecution, in a major legal victory for the Republican White House candidate.\nThe 6-3 ruling did not outright dismiss an indictment that charges Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election, but it did strip away key elements of the case against him.\nThe justices found that a president has immunity for \"official acts\", but is not immune for \"unofficial acts\", and referred the matter back to a trial judge.\nThe three liberal justices dissented strongly, expressing \u201cfear for our democracy\u201d. \n\u201cThe President is now a king above the law,\u201d wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\nThe decision makes it less likely that the Republican candidate will stand trial in the case before he challenges Democratic President Joe Biden in November's White House election.\nIt is the first time since the nation's founding that the Supreme Court has declared former presidents can be shielded from criminal charges. \nTrump is the first president ever to be criminally prosecuted, as Chief Justice John Roberts noted while delivering Monday's opinion.\n\"Big win for our constitution and democracy,\" wrote Trump in an all-capital letters post on his social media platform Truth Social.\nIn a fiery phone call with the media, deputy Biden campaign manager Quentin Fulks could be heard banging his fist on the table as he spoke.\n\"Immune, immune, immune. They just handed Donald Trump keys to a dictatorship,\" Mr Fulks said, pointing out that three of the justices had been appointed by Trump.\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith, who filed the indictment, declined to comment.\nThe majority opinion by the highest court in the land tossed out a lower court opinion that had rejected Trump's claim of absolute immunity.\nThe justices found a president does enjoy absolute immunity for certain official conduct, but can still be prosecuted for private acts.\nJustice Roberts wrote that a president's discussions with the Department of Justice are official acts of the presidency, and he or she is therefore \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from prosecution for such interactions. \nThe indictment alleges Trump pressured the law-enforcement agency to investigate claims - which were found to be unsubstantiated - that widespread voter fraud had affected the election result.\nJustice Roberts wrote that a president's discussions with his vice-president are also official conduct, and Trump is therefore \"at least presumptively immune\u201d from allegations that he tried to pressure Mike Pence not to certify Mr Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election.\nThe indictment accuses Trump of inciting the US Capitol riot, citing his tweets and remarks he made outside the White House that day.\nBut the Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Trump's speech and social media activity on 6 January 2021 were all official acts.\nIn another blow to the case, the justices ruled that Trump's private records - and those of his advisors - \"may not be admitted as evidence at trial\".\nThe opinion raised questions, too, about whether allegations that Trump pressured state officials to change their electoral votes in order to overturn his election defeat constituted unofficial acts, but ultimately left it to the lower court to decide.\n\"The parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictment\u2019s charges without such conduct,\" said the opinion, raising doubts about the potential viability of the case once the official acts are stripped away.\nIn her dissent, Justice Sotomayor argued that the ruling would protect a president if he or she ordered US special forces to assassinate a political rival, organised a military coup to hold on to power, or took bribes in exchange for conferring a pardon.\nJustice Jackson wrote in a separate dissent that the conservative majority\u2019s ruling \u201cbreaks new and dangerous ground\u201d and would \u201clet down the guardrails of the law\u201d.\nBut Justice Roberts wrote that the \u201ctone of chilling doom\u201d from the dissenters was \u201cwholly disproportionate\u201d.\nHis opinion said that immunity extends to the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of the president\u2019s official responsibilities, setting a higher bar for prosecution.\nThis ruling is \u201camong the worst-case scenarios\u201d for the special counsel, says Aziz Huq, a constitutional law expert at the University of Chicago.\n\u201cI think it will be important to see if [Jack] Smith can narrow the indictment by eliminating those facts that the Court has ranked as 'official',\u201d he told the BBC.\n\"This is a major victory for Donald Trump,\" legal expert Mitchell Epner told the BBC.\nHe said the trial judge will now have to decide which charges can move forward, and Trump will be able again to appeal against her ruling all the way to the Supreme Court.\nAdditional reporting by Kayla Epstein",
    "A West Yorkshire man whose parents live on a small Caribbean island devastated by Hurricane Beryl has set up a charity to help residents rebuild their lives.  \nLee Shephard Quashie started life in Huddersfield, but moved to Carriacou to live with his grandparents when he was five years old, returning to the UK when he was 12. \nHis parents Margaret and Christopher have since moved to the island, which has close links with Huddersfield after a large number of Carriacouans moved there to work in the textile mills in the 1950s and 1960s. \nWhen the category four storm hit on 1 July, islanders were left without electricity or means of communication and many of their homes were destroyed.\nBarman Mr Quashie, 47, came up with the idea of setting up the charity when his employer - Maverick's bar in Bingley - arranged a fundraising event at their Huddersfield venue as a way of showing their support.  \nManager Vicky Foster said: \"We had seen that Hurricane Beryl was hitting Carriacou and we were all messaging Lee and checking he was OK. \n\"The minute he found out his parents had survived I thought, how can we help?\n\"I checked with the owners of Maverick's if we could hold a charity night and they said, let\u2019s move it Huddersfield, as it has the biggest population of people from Carriacou in the UK.\"\nBacking this up, Mr Quashie said: \"Huddersfield has a massive population from the island of Carriacou, because they moved as a community to work in the mills after a recruitment drive. \n\"There are three main places you will find Carriacou and Grenada people and that's Huddersfield, Bedford and London.\"\nHurricane Beryl was a category four storm when it hit the island with sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h), but has since been downgraded to a tropical depression. \nIt brought thunderstorms which produced heavy rain and strong winds, with many buildings destroyed, but fortunately no fatalities among the population of about 9,000. \nMr Quashie said it was an \"idyllic\" island, where \"everybody helps everybody\".\n\"Just as beautiful as the island is, the people are as well,\" he said. \n\"It was gut-wrenching to see the residents of the island suffering as they were. \n\"Afterwards, there were videos, and the people all had smiles on their faces because they said God spared life, and they were grateful.\"\nHis parents live in Mount Royal at the top of the island. \n\"They have lost electricity, communication, the roof has gone so they are living in the downstairs at the moment,\" he said. \n\"Any electrical goods have gone, clothes have been washed away. They are in quite a bad way.\"\nHe said he was grateful to Maverick's for arranging the fundraiser - called Beryl's Bounceback, which starts at 14:00 BST on Sunday at the Huddersfield bar. \nThe team plan to raise \u00a320,000 for Carriacou Unite - which Mr Quashie hopes will continue to raise money for years to come. \n\"We want to do more, because it is going to take a long time to get back to how they were before,\" he said. \nMs Foster said: \"We have been putting together a list of DJs to play soca, reggae and dance hall, R&B, garage, baseline and Afrobeats. \n\"We have traditional Caribbean cuisine, auctions and a tombola. \n\"Mavericks will be donating bar profits and any money raised to Carriacou Unite, who will buy supplies for people to rebuild their homes.\"\nThe charity is working with local groups iRoko Community Alliance and Carriacou Hurricane Beryl Relief Fund.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

    "In September 2023, Simon Boas was diagnosed with throat cancer. Aged just 46, he was told the disease was terminal, and that it would ultimately take his life. \nOver the following year, he knitted together his reflections on life into a book - A Beginner's Guide to Dying. The book is set to hit the shelves in October. It will be a posthumous publication.\nIn what he expects to be one of his final interviews, Simon spoke to Emma Barnett on the Today Programme, offering his reflections on life and death as he moved into hospice care. \nMy pain is under control and I'm terribly happy - it sounds weird to say, but I'm as happy as I've ever been in my life.  \nI used to think I'd rather be hit by the proverbial bus, but having a couple of months knowing this is coming has really helped me both do the boring 'death-min', but also get my thoughts and prepare myself, and feel so accepting of what's to come.\nIt's been such a great bonus, actually.  \nThe book is called A Beginner's Guide to Dying, but really what I'm trying to convey is how enjoying life to the full kind of prepares you for this. \nIn some ways I was lucky that my life and my career have taken me to quite a lot of places where death is more a part of life than it is for us in the West. \nI spent my life as an aid worker - quite a lot with the UN - and I've lived in places where death is something that not just exists in the background, but is imminently possible. \nI spent three years running a UN office in the Gaza Strip. I spent a lot of time in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and I've been working in Ukraine. Seeing people there for whom death is such a part of life - they lose children, they don't know where the next meal is coming from - has really helped me. \nI've also been a Samaritan for the past four years. In some cases you are on the line while people end their lives, so I think death has been more a part of my life than for many people. \nIt does us all good to think about it. \nThat's not in a gloomy way... by kind of realising it's inevitable and it's a part of life, it actually throws life into perspective and helps you to enjoy it more and prioritise the important things. \nMy family are about to go through the most difficult thing in their lives. My lovely wife, Aurelie, and my parents... are well surrounded, and I hope that my cheerfulness in the leaving of life might perhaps help them in the next few years...\nAll our lives are little books - but they're not someone else's complete book. You're a chapter or a page or a footnote in someone else's life and they are going to keep writing beautiful chapters when you are gone. \nAnd those green shoots can grow around grief and put it in perspective. I hope people will think, \"I'm glad I read that - Simon's story\". And just because it's over, doesn't mean it's gone. \nYou don't need to have been a politician or a mover and shaker or an aid worker or anything in life. All of us make a huge difference. \nI love this quote from George Eliot's Middlemarch: \n\"The effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistorical acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.\u201d\nAll of us make a huge difference in life. I love the idea that most films about time travel revolve around changing one tiny thing in the past, and of course they come back to the present and everything is different. \nIf you project that forward, you can change huge amounts of things into the future. \nAll our tombs will be unvisited in a few years - all our actions will mostly be unremembered - but the smile you gave the checkout lady or the kind words you gave to a stranger in the street could still be rippling forward. \nWe all have that opportunity and it's a huge power. And I want everyone to realise how special and precious they are.\nI love melted cheese. Unfortunately I haven't been able to eat since Christmas. The chemotherapy killed my taste buds and the radiotherapy killed my salivary glands. \nSo, sadly, melted cheese and all the things I loved are off the menu. \nHowever, I've been given full permission by my oncologist and my hospice team to enjoy as much Muscadet and as many cheeky rollups as I want - and I shall certainly be indulging in those and spending time with my family.\nI'm sort of - not looking forward to my final day - of course that's the wrong way to see it.  But I'm kind of curious about it, and I'm happy and I'm ready. \nAs Julian of Norwich said: \"All shall be well, and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well.\" \nSimon Boas, who is from Jersey in the Channel Islands, expects to move into a hospice on Thursday where he will be spending his final days surrounded by his family. \nWhen the Today Programme checked in with him that morning he was, unsurprisingly, in good spirits.

    "The organiser of a 1940s-themed weekend which had to be cancelled less than a day before it was due to take place has criticised a council for not allowing it to go ahead.\nThe Saltaire 1940s weekend was expected to be held in Roberts Park on the weekend of 29-30 June, but Bradford Council said on Friday 28 June that  it could not allow it to go ahead \"for everyone's safety\".\nA council spokesperson said the decision was made following advice from its Safety Advisory Group (SAG).\nOn social media, Marie McCahery, who organised the event, said: \"To cancel late Friday morning is totally unacceptable.\"\nAs part of the event, a 1940s re-enactment display was planned, as well as a display of small military vehicles and classic cars.\nA dance marquee was expected to be a focus of the weekend, with \"vintage policemen, prams and poodles\" also taking part, according to the event's Facebook page.\nA Bradford Council spokesperson said it was decided not to allow the event to take place at the local authority-run park after \"the latest advice from SAG\".\nThe SAG is made up of representatives of the council, police, fire and ambulance services. \nThe spokesperson said the SAG \"had been engaging with the event organiser for some time\" and the decision not to give the go-ahead was \"very rare and the decision is therefore not taken lightly\".\n\"All event organisers must ensure that full and comprehensive plans are in place well in advance of their event, so that these can be assessed by SAG,\" they added.\n\"We realise how disappointed the organiser and people who were planning on visiting the event must feel, however these plans are there for everyone\u2019s safety.\"\nThe spokesperson said such events required full risk assessments, evidence of adequate public liability insurance and medical assessment forms from Yorkshire Ambulance Service.\nDetailed site plans, command structures, as well as event management plans, including crowd management and event security plans, were also required.\nIn a post on Facebook, Ms McCahery said she was \"going to fight to find out exactly what happened and why\".\n\"If they had reservations about safety, they could have contacted me earlier in the week so I could tweak the Event Management Plan to their satisfaction, but they did nothing and waited until way past the last moment to cancel the event,\" she said.\n\"It was less than 24 hours before the event started for the public, but traders etc had already set off. The marquee and security were almost at the park. Many people from afar were already on their way and it was too late to cancel hotel reservations,\" Ms McCahery added.\nThe organiser also highlighted her concerns about implications for next year's Bradford 2025 UK City of Culture events.\n\"Who will come from afar to a Bradford event if it might be cancelled at such extremely short notice? This does not bode well for events being organized for Bradford 2025,\" she wrote.\nDespite the main event being cancelled, some people still dressed up in 1940s-inspired clothing and danced at Saltaire's Victoria Hall. \nThe decision to cancel the Saltaire event followed Haworth's 1940s weekend being postponed until 2025 due to issues around road closures and traffic management.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Work to bolster a stretch of vulnerable coastline has moved to its second phase after North Norfolk District Council (NNDC) agreed to spend \u00a325m on shoreline protections for the seaside towns of Cromer and Mundesley.\nSo what is being put in place - and how will the works affect beachgoers?\nThe project is a scheme to ensure two coastal towns fend off the ravages of the North Sea.\nThe Cromer coastal management scheme includes refurbishments to six timber groynes - wooden structures built perpendicular to the shore - navigation beacons, sea walls, and access improvements.\nWork has already started at Cromer's East Promenade, near the Fisherman's Ramp.\nSome 38,000 tonnes of rock armour revetment have been placed on the west side of Cromer Pier along the shoreline. \nThe application site covers 88 acres (36 ha) - the full Cromer frontage - which is about a mile (1.6km) long.\nWork at Mundesley, further south along the coast, got under way in the spring.\nIt included remedial works to existing groynes and navigation beacons, sea walls and aprons.\nA rock berm will be created using 30,000 tonnes of rock placed in front of the existing steel structure along west beach to absorb the energy of the waves. \nThat application site covers 60 acres (24 ha), about a mile of Mundesley sea front.\nSome 600 homes will be protected from coastal erosion and flooding in total, NNDC said.\nWho is funding this?\nThe cost of the entire project is \u00a325m, although it was originally costed at \u00a314.1m.\nThe increase was blamed on inflation dramatically pushing up prices for materials and labour.\nThe funding has been met mostly by a government grant from the Environment Agency and NNDC. \nMundesley Parish Council is contributing to the town's project. \nCan you still access the beaches?\nRock deliveries are being carried out at high tide by barges through an agreed corridor, and then manoeuvred into place by dumpsters. The barges will then leave on the next high tide. \nNNDC said that \"for health and safety reasons, some localised beach closures will be necessary while the rock is being unloaded\".\nSigns and traffic marshals will also be on hand to direct members of the public to safe locations to watch the rock delivery.\nThe primary purpose of rock is to reduce the energy of the waves, which in turn will help keep sediment (sand and shingle) longer. \nBeach levels should remain more stable as a result, the council said.\nWhat sort of disruption can be expected and for how long?\nSome temporary,  localised beach closures will be necessary while the rock is unloaded, the council said. \nRunton Road car park where the work site has been set up, will remain open.\nSmall work sites will be located on the promenade to help with the work or to store.\nThe project will be completed at Cromer by winter 2024, said NNDC.\nHowever, the Runton Road car park work site will stay in place until summer 2025 to help with the work at Mundesley.\nHow many other coastal places in Norfolk are affected by sea erosion?\nThe whole of Norfolk's coastline has been impacted by erosion with additional sea defences called for at many other resorts.\nAccording to Dr John Barlow, senior lecturer in applied geomorphology at the University of Sussex, the East Anglia coastline is particularly vulnerable.\n\"It's a combination of the poorly consolidated clay, silt and sand material that form the cliffs and the exposure to storm waves coming down the North Sea,\" he said.\nThere are lots of Norfolk coastal communities trying to petition for funds for better defences too.\nA project costing \u00a32m to repair damaged sea defences along a 10-mile stretch of coastline between Happisburgh and Winterton is set to begin.\nBut controversially, in Hemsby, where some 20 homes have crumbled into the sea in the past two decades, residents have been told the town does not meet the criteria of government funding formulas to pay for its \u00a320m rock defence scheme.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "George Clooney has issued a damning call for Joe Biden to quit the US presidential race, hours after senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi swerved questions about whether he should continue.\nThe actor and prominent Democratic fundraiser said the president had won many battles in his career, \"but the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time\".\nAnother Hollywood star and fundraiser, Michael Douglas, later told the BBC he was \"worried\" about Mr Biden's electoral chances.\nThe president has stated, repeatedly, that he is determined to remain as the Democratic party's candidate and beat Donald Trump, 78, in November. \nThe celebrities' comments came after Mrs Pelosi, the former House Speaker, joined growing disquiet in the party, saying time was \"running short\" for Mr Biden, 81, to decide whether to stay in the race after his stumbling debate against Trump.\nClooney wrote in the New York Times that it was \"devastating to say it\", but the Joe Biden he met at a fundraising event three weeks ago was not the Biden of 2010. \"He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020,\" added the actor.\n\"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney said. \nThe fundraising event, co-hosted by Clooney in Los Angeles and also featuring Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand, brought in a single-night record of roughly $30m (\u00a323m) for the Biden campaign. \nThe Biden camp has hit back at the Hollywood star, with an unnamed source telling US media: \u201cThe President stayed for over 3 hours [at the fundraiser], while Clooney took a photo quickly and left.\u201d\nThe president's campaign also pointed out that when he attended the fundraiser he had just arrived in Los Angeles from Italy, where he had been at the G7 summit.\nIn his op-ed, Clooney wrote: \"Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn\u2019t see what we just saw.\"\n\"This is about age. Nothing more,\" he continued. \"We are not going to win in November with this president.\"\nClooney added that his concerns matched those of \"every\" member of Congress with whom he had spoken.\nIn his own comments, Michael Douglas said he had concerns about Mr Biden's capabilities during a potential second term: \"I am worried not this week or next week, but let's say next year.\"\nThe actor said he had held a fundraiser in April for Mr Biden, who he believed had done an \"incredible job\". But, citing the debate with Trump, he said it was important for a candidate to be \"articulate\" during such a \"combative\" political era.\nAsked to respond to Clooney, Mr Biden's campaign referred to a letter the president sent Democrats in Congress that said he was \"firmly committed\" to his candidacy and beating Trump.\nYet public dissent continues to grow within Mr Biden's party as he faces scrutiny while hosting the Nato summit in Washington.\nMrs Pelosi, a highly influential voice among Capitol Hill Democrats, on Wednesday appeared to disregard Mr Biden's insistence that he was determined to forge on.\nWhen asked if he should stay in the election race, she told MSNBC's Morning Joe: \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do. \n\"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.\"\nAcknowledging the demands on the president during the Nato summit, Mrs Pelosi told MSNBC: \"I said to everyone - let's just hold off. \n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president.\"\nAround a dozen elected Democrats have suggested he abandon his campaign since his 27 June debate with Trump.\nOn Tuesday night, Michael Bennet of Colorado became the first Democratic senator to publicly dissent. \nAlthough he did not call for Mr Biden to quit outright, he said Trump would win the election, possibly by a \"landslide\".\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Peter Welch of Vermont became the first Senate Democrat to openly call on Mr Biden to withdraw, \"for the good of the country\", as he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.  \nHe was joined by the eighth and ninth congressional Democrats to make similar calls: Pat Ryan from New York and Earl Blumenauer from Oregon.\nThe Biden campaign repeated the president's statement that he was \"running this race to the end\". \nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries plans to speak to Mr Biden by Friday to discuss the concerns brought by several congressional party members.\nOverall support from elected Democrats remains robust, however. \nGavin Newsom, the California governor who was named by Clooney as a potential replacement, said he was still \u201call in\u201d with Mr Biden. \nThe Congressional Black Caucus, a group of roughly 60 politicians, and progressive  House members like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, have publicly backed Mr Biden. \nOn Tuesday, Chuck Schumer, the leading Democrat in the Senate, said: \"I'm with Joe.\" Axios, however, reports that Mr Schumer has been privately telling donors he is open to dumping Mr Bide",

Driving licences belonging to both Andrew Tate and J were later submitted to Stripe as proof of identity and address.\nThe majority of payments out of this account went to one of Andrew Tate's accounts, the court heard.\nJ also moved money through her own Revolut bank account, including one payment of \u00a3805,000, the court heard.\nOf this, \u00a3495,000 was paid to Andrew Tate, and \u00a375,000 to an account in J's name that was later converted to cryptocurrency, it is alleged.\nThe proceedings are civil, which uses a lower standard of proof than criminal cases.\nChief Magistrate Paul Goldspring will decide on the balance of probabilities whether what the police claim is true.\nThe case was adjourned until Tuesday.\nAndrew Tate is a self-described misogynist and was previously banned from social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views.\nIn a separate case in Romania, the Tate brothers, former kickboxers who are dual UK-US nationals, are accused of exploiting women via an adult content business, which prosecutors allege operated as a criminal group.\nTwo female Romanian associates were also named alongside the brothers in an indictment published in June last year, and seven alleged victims were identified.\nAndrew Tate has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence against him and there is a conspiracy to silence him.\nThe internet personalities are also wanted in the UK over alleged sexual offences, which they deny.",
    "Thousands of university students in Bangladesh have been staging protests against a recruitment system that they say favours children of war heroes and certain groups for high-paying government jobs.\nThe protesters say the system is discriminatory and they are calling for recruitment to be based on merit.\nA third of posts are kept for the children of those who fought to win the country independence in 1971. Some are also reserved for women, ethnic minorities and the disabled.\nCritics say the system unfairly benefits the children of pro-government groups that support Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who won her fourth straight election in January.\nMs Hasina is the daughter of Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\nEarlier this week, students blocked roads and highways in the capital Dhaka and other major cities, bringing traffic to a halt. The protests have been called the Bangla Blockade.\nSome laid logs on a railway track in the capital, disrupting train services to northern parts of the country.\nBangladesh's top court temporarily suspended the system on Wednesday, but protests are expected to continue until it is permanently removed.\nThe system was reinstated by a separate court just last month. It had been halted since 2018, following weeks of protests.\n\"We will not return to classrooms until our demand is met,\" protest leader Rasel Ahmed told the AFP news agency. \n\"My demand is not to cancel the system. My demand is for quota reform,\" one  protester told BBC Bangla.\nAnother student said he would keep protesting until a  \"permanent solution\" is found.\nGovernment jobs are highly coveted in Bangladesh because they pay well. In total, more than half of the positions - amounting to hundreds of thousands - are reserved for certain groups.\nEarlier this month, Ms Hasina condemned the protests, saying students were \"wasting their time\", while adding there was \"no justification for the anti-quota movement\".\nBangladesh, which was once one of the poorest countries in the world, is now one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia.\nIts per capita income has tripled in the last decade and the World Bank estimates that more than 25 million people have been lifted out of poverty over the last two decades.\nBut its economy spun into turmoil in mid-2022 following the pandemic and the global economic slowdown.",

If I can prevent this from happening to someone else, I am going to do that,\" added Ms Bradley.\n\"I am training to be a midwife from September, and Theo is my inspiration.\n\"New midwives that are training can be the change that the [maternity] service needs - we can make the difference.\"\nA coroner recorded a narrative conclusion that found neglect contributed to Theo\u2019s death.\nThe inquest heard there had been an \"oversight\" over who was responsible for Ms Bradley, who was left waiting for treatment.\nMs Bradley was a week past her due date when she went into labour with Theo - her first child - on 13 September last year.\nAfter going into hospital, she was initially sent home with painkillers - but the inquest heard she should have been monitored for a further hour. \nWithin a short time of returning home to Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Ms Bradley began to suffer pain, more contractions and bleeding.\nThe family rang the hospital, and a midwife told Ms Bradley to return to King's Mill.\nWhen she arrived at around 01:00 GMT on 14 September, she was placed in a side room of the maternity triage area, where patients are initially assessed.\nShe was given basic checks by a health care assistant, and at 01:25 Ms Bradley's partner, Luke Sherwood went into the corridor and shouted for help, but no-one came, the inquest heard.\nIn a statement read to the court, Ms Bradley said they could hear staff talking, including one member discussing how many sweets they had eaten that evening.\nMr Sherwood, 26, was said to be panicking and shouted for help a second time.\nAnother midwife came into the triage area at 01:42 and asked why no-one had been to see Ms Bradley.\nWhen subsequent checks found the baby's heartbeat was slow, Theo was born by emergency Caesarean at 02:02 and taken to Nottingham City Hospital.\nThe following day medics withdrew his treatment and his parents were able to hold him for 30 minutes before he died.\nA post-mortem examination found Theo had suffered brain damage from a lack of oxygen.\nAssistant coroner for Nottinghamshire, Dr Elizabeth Didcock, recorded a narrative conclusion which found neglect contributed to Theo\u2019s death.\nShe said: \"Had he been delivered earlier, he would on balance have survived. The delay made a more than minimal, negligible or trivial contribution to Theo's death.\"\nPhil Bolton, chief nurse at Sherwood Forest Hospitals, said: \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our unreserved apology to the family of baby Theo.\n\u201cOnly the individuals involved that night truly know why Theo and his family did not receive the care they needed and deserved.\n\"I am clear we have failed to live up to the high standards of care our communities are right to expect from their local hospitals.\n\u201cWe have gone through a thorough HR process following Theo\u2019s death and appropriate actions have been taken.\n\u201cWe will take the coroner\u2019s findings on board and will continue working with Theo\u2019s family to do all we can to prevent this from happening again.\u201d\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Volunteers are wanted for the \"last moment of archaeology\" on a \u00a33.5m pub restoration project.\nExperts are trying to uncover a 19th-Century path between the Old Black Lion and the adjacent church in Northampton.\nThe path is causing problems with damp in the pub.\nIt is hoped the long-disused hostelry will reopen for business by the beginning of 2025.\nThe project is designed to return the pub building to its original role of providing refreshment and create new offices for the Churches Conservation Trust, which looks after redundant places of worship.\nThe pub is next door to St Peter's Church, which stopped hosting regular worship in 1995 and is looked after by the trust.\nNick Patrick, from the trust, said previous digs at the site had already produced some significant finds.\nHe said: \"There was something called Stamford Ware, which is our earliest glazed pottery, which we start to find in the 9th Century going through to the 13th Century.\n\"They also found evidence of some ovens, so hospitality has been at the heart of the Old Black Lion site for near-on 1,000 years, which is remarkable.\"\nThe archaeologists now have a new challenge - solving a problem that has developed on the pub site.\n\"The thing we're looking at next week is the area between pub and church,\" Mr Patrick said.\n\"We know there's a 19th-Century pathway and we need to uncover that because the churchyard has moved up against the wall of the pub, and it's causing quite serious damp problems in the pub. So we need to excavate that, find this old pathway and see what's there.\"\nVolunteers over the age of 16 are being invited to help out next week, and training will be given.\nMr Patrick believes programmes such as Time Team give the impression that archaeology is all about digging with trowels, but it \"is more than just that\".\nHe said: \"It's burrowing away the soil, it's sorting the finds out and washing them, so there really is something for everyone, and we've got an opportunity for two or three people every day next week.\"\nHe added that the pub was due to open by the beginning of next year.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The former head of the police complaints watchdog has gone on trial charged with sexual offences against two teenage girls more than 30 years ago.\nMichael Lockwood, 65, from Epsom, Surrey, is charged with eight counts of indecent assault against one girl between August 1979 and August 1981.\nHe is also accused of three counts of rape and six counts of indecent assault against a second girl between October 1985 and March 1986.\nThe defendant has denied all the charges.\nThe Old Bailey heard that both 14-year-old girls were allegedly attacked by Mr Lockwood while he worked as a lifeguard at a leisure centre in the Hull area of East Yorkshire.\nOpening the case for the prosecution, Jonathan Polnay KC, said the defendant was also employed as a senior auditor at Humberside County Council at the time and was 12 years older than one of his alleged victims.\n\"The imbalance is obvious in everything - age, money, experience and to be blunt about it, power,\" he said.\nThe court heard that Mr Lockwood had walked with one alleged victim after dark and leant across and kissed her.\nIt also heard he used to give her lifts home from the leisure centre, kissing her and \"touching her breasts\" at drop off.\nThe jury heard that Mr Lockwood wanted to \"take things further\" and as a member of staff had access to private areas of the leisure centre such as a chemicals storeroom.\nHe had led the girl there on several occasions and assaulted and raped her, Mr Polnay said.\nThe court heard that \"at no stage\" did Mr Lockwood ask if she wanted any of this to happen and according to the alleged victim \"it just happened\" and she \"didn't resist\".\nMr Polnay said: \"She trusted Mr Lockwood. She was worried if anyone found out what had happened she would be in trouble and would be banned from the leisure centre.\"\nMany years later the alleged victim sought counselling and decided to report the matter to the police, jurors heard.\nIn a police interview the defendant denied the allegations and said he had no recollection of ever knowing the girl.\nIn a further interview Mr Lockwood speculated that the alleged victim might have been \"obsessed\" with him, which was why she was making untrue allegations.\nFrom 2018 to 2022, Mr Lockwood was director general of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which handles complaints against police in England and Wales.\nDue to his high-profile role there had been \"extensive reporting\" that he was facing allegations of a sexual nature, the court heard.\nA second alleged victim read reports of this in a local newspaper and also contacted police.\nShe claimed that when she was 14 years old she had attended the same leisure centre where she met Michael Lockwood, then aged 20 and a student at the time.\nThey had \"got chatting\" and four months after they first met he had opened the door to a male toilet, pulled her inside and kissed her.\nThis was the first of the encounters between the pair, which moved on to the leisure centre storeroom where Mr Lockwood touched her breasts, the court heard.\n\"She will tell you that she thought she loved him,\" Mr Polnay said.\nAfter the girl turned 15 Mr Lockwood had picked her up in his mother's car and there were further indecent assaults, the court heard.\nIn an interview with police, the defendant accepted having a sexual relationship with the girl, but said he believed at the time she was aged over 16.\nThe trial, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "Work is ongoing in the Sound of Mull to limit pollution following the sinking of a fish farm landing craft.\nThe Julie Anne, operated by Scottish Sea Farms, sank on Thursday, near the company's Fiunary salmon farming site.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said steps were taken to limit the spread of oil and it was not aware of any fish being harmed.\nPlans are now being put in place for the removal of the remaining oil and recovery of the 15m (49ft) vessel, off the Ardnamurchan coast.\nFollowing the incident specialist divers assessed the site and action was taken to seal a release of oil.\nAs an additional precaution, booms were deployed around the area.\nSince Thursday divers have made daily visits to the site to stop and seal any further releases of oil and remove any debris.\nThe Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has also made three surveillance flights of the site and continues to monitor the area.\nIf approved by the MCA a recovery plan would see the remaining fuel extracted from the vessel, which was brought into service in 2015.\nIt will then be raised and a full inspection carried out to establish the cause of the sinking.\nGerry McCormick, Scottish Sea Farms' head of health & safety, said: \"We are incredibly grateful to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) for their advice, guidance and support.\n\"Our immediate priority, with the assistance of specialist divers and environmental services, has been to check for any potential fuel leaks, seal any areas found to be releasing small quantities of fuel, and re-check these multiple times daily. \n\"As an added precaution, we have also deployed oil booms around the incident area.\n\"Our collective focus now is on removing the fuel and re-floating the vessel \u2013 a first for Scottish Sea Farms in close to 25 years of farming \u2013 which we hope to have done within the week, after which we will carry out a full and thorough inspection.\"\nSepa said it received reports of a sunken vessel at the Scottish Sea Farms site near Fiunary on Thursday.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cThe operator placed booms in the water to contain any potential pollution and prevent dispersal, and divers have been monitoring the vessel to check for and plug leaks. \n\"While a small fuel leakage was initially observed, this has been contained and no further pollution has been recorded.\" \nIt added the operator would continue to apply mitigation measures before the vessel is recovered.",
    "A ban on politicians lying will be brought in before the 2026 Senedd elections, the Welsh government has promised.\nCounsel General Mick Antoniw vowed to legislate on Tuesday in a move that spared the government an embarrassing defeat in the Welsh Parliament.\nLabour faced losing a vote as it tried to stop a Plaid Cymru attempt to pass its own version of the ban.\nMr Antoniw promised that the law would disqualify Senedd politicians and candidates found guilty of deliberate deception from being a Member of the Senedd (MS).\nBBC Wales was told that ministers cut a deal with Plaid Cymru and former Labour minister Lee Waters hours before the vote was due to take place.\nIn the end the government won with 26 votes for, 13 against and with 13 abstentions.\nFormer Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said what had been announced was \"truly historic\".\nDiscussions had taken place with opposition parties throughout the day, with Mr Antoniw even taking the unusual step of going to a meeting of the Conservative Party group on Tuesday morning.\nIn May, Mr Waters helped the former Plaid leader amend a law on the operation of elections, currently being considered by the Senedd, to introduce a new offence of deception in politics.\nThat was despite opposition from the Welsh government.\nMr Antoniw, who the government's chief legal adviser, criticised the lack of consultation with the police.\nIn a letter to MSs he warned it presented \"a serious risk of political debate being stifled and effective scrutiny of the government undermined\".\nOn Tuesday, he tried to have Mr Price's offences deleted from his bill, which among other items would lay the groundwork for piloting automatic voter registration, via an amendment.\nBut he faced losing as the entire opposition - including Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and Welsh Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds - united to support Mr Price's offence.\nThe law, had it been passed, would have given politicians and candidates 14 days to withdraw a false statement.\nIf they were prosecuted through the courts they would be banned from being an MS for four years.\nIt is not yet clear whether the proposed law would make lying a criminal offence or a civil sanction.\nIn the Senedd, Mr Antoniw said: \"The Welsh government will bring forward legislation before 2026 for the disqualification of members and candidates found guilty of deliberate deception, though an independent judicial process.\"\nHe said he would invite the standards committee of the Senedd \"to make proposals to that effect\".\nHe said it was a \"matter that goes to the heart of everyone\".\nMr Price called it a \"landmark moment and is a recognition that existing mechanisms to ensure public trust and confidence in politics have failed\".\nHe said it would make Wales the first country to outlaw political lying.\nIn an hour-long debate, Mr Waters, MS for Llanelli, said that \"no doubt, politics in this country has become darker\"\u201d.\nHe recounted a year in his consistency where he had encountered \"lying, manipulation, racist abuse, arson\" and \"mobs whipped up by the visiting far right descending on the homes of those who put their heads above the parapet\".\nHe added: \"It's been an awful, upsetting experience seeing ugliness becoming quietly normalised.\n\u201cIt\u2019s naive... to think that democratic traditions are sacred. We mustn\u2019t allow this\u2026 norm spoiling in any form.\"\nPeter Fox, Welsh Conservative, told the debate: \"It is so fundamental that we try to rebuild the trust that has been diminished in in our vocation, because it's so fundamental to democracy that we are trusted and believed.\n\"Sadly, that's been eroded.\"\nBut he said he was concerned Mr Antoniw's proposal \"might not give the parliamentary time to enable things to go forward\".\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Ms Dodds, her party's only MS, asked \"why does lying flourish in politics?\"\n\"Because we can get away with it. Deception can run among politicians, largely because we face no real repercussions.\"",
    "Knives are out for Joe Biden after his poorly received performance in the first 2024 presidential debate against Donald Trump. \nWith November's election bearing down, a growing number of Democrats are calling on the president to step aside due to concerns about his mental fitness. \nAround a dozen Democrats have publicly broken ranks and called for Mr Biden to step aside to be replaced by someone younger from his party.\nMr Biden has defiantly vowed to stay in the race, including during public events and in interviews with ABC News and MSNBC.  \nUnless he agrees to stand aside, it will get ugly. \nLet's run through the scenarios.\nYes, if - and it's a big if - Mr Biden decides to step down as the Democratic Party's standard bearer, it would be relatively straightforward to find another candidate.\nThe party's nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago from 19-22 August.\nThe Democrats are reportedly planning to nominate Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris virtually ahead of that gathering.\nThere, a candidate must win support from the majority of \"delegates\" - party officials who formally choose the nominee. Delegates are assigned to candidates proportionally based on the results of each state's primary election. \nThis year, Mr Biden won almost 99% of the nearly 4,000 delegates.\nAccording to DNC rules, those delegates are \"pledged\" to support the incumbent president. \nIf Mr Biden willingly drops out, it could turn into a free-for-all. \nDemocrats would be left with an open convention where they would suggest potential nominees and continue voting until one receives the majority of delegate votes. \nThat could spark a frantic contest among Democrats vying for a shot at the nomination. \nMr Biden has so far given no indication that he would consider stepping aside. \nBut if he decides to do so, \"that opens up an entirely different can of worms\", political historian Leah Wright Rigueur told BBC News.  \n\"I think that if he were to get replaced, part of the negotiation for him stepping down would be that he would get the final say in who replaces him,\" she said.  \nIf he doesn't want to go, this is where the process gets really tricky.\nIn the modern political era, a major national party has never tried a hostile takeover of the nomination. \nHowever, DNC regulations do have some loopholes that could, in theory, make it possible to push Mr Biden out. \nThe rules allow delegates to \"in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them\", meaning they could look to someone else.\n\"It could be an incredibly ugly scenario,\" Ms Wright Rigueur said. \nExperts told BBC News they doubt there would be a revolt among party delegates.\nBut the DNC can alter party rules at any point.\nMs Wright Rigueur pointed to 1968, when President Lyndon B Johnson decided not to run for re-election.\nThe party shifted from an open convention process, in which delegates could cast ballots for whomever they chose, to a bound process, where a delegate was attached to a candidate based on primary results. \nEven if Mr Biden were suddenly to exit the race, conservative groups have vowed to file lawsuits challenging the legality of any replacement Democrat's eligibility for the ballot.\nVice-President Kamala Harris would automatically take Mr Biden's place if he were to step down during his presidential term.\nBut the same rules do not apply if Mr Biden pulls out as a candidate for November's election race, and there is no mechanism in place that would give the vice-president an upper hand at an open convention. \nInstead, Ms Harris would have to win the majority of delegates, just like any other candidate.\nIt may be that Mr Biden backs her to replace him if he steps aside.\nAs she is already on the Democratic ticket, Ms Harris would have access to all the campaign funds currently available to the president. And she has a national profile.\nBut her relatively low popularity among the American public might dull that advantage. \n\nThe 25th Amendment of the Constitution allows the US vice-president and the majority of the cabinet to declare the president unable to perform the duties of office. \nIf invoked, power is transferred to the vice-president to serve as acting president.  \nThis has never happened before. \nBut following the debate, senior congressional Republicans called on Mr Biden's cabinet to consider invoking this clause. \nAfter the US Capitol riot in 2021, the Democratic-controlled House approved a resolution urging then-Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Trump, but the move went nowhere.",
    "Kate Forbes has insisted misogyny in politics is \u201cnot unique\u201d to the SNP but must be \u201crooted out\u201d of the party, after criticism from two former MPs.\nThe Deputy First Minister said the \u201cpolarising and intoxicating\u201d nature of the western political climate meant democracies were \u201cstruggling\u201d to hold back a tide of prejudice against women.\nOusted former SNP MP Joanna Cherry and ex-drugs minister Elena Whitham both highlighted abuse they had faced from within the party last week.\nMs Forbes told BBC Radio\u2019s Good Morning Scotland failure to tackle such abuse would lead to women avoiding future political roles.\nMs Cherry said she would not miss the \u201dstinking misogyny\u201d of some men within the SNP after she was described as a \u201cpathetic, narcissistic, abusive loser\u201d by a former party worker.\nPosting on X following her defeat to Labour in the Edinburgh South West seat, she accused the party of \u201cignoring complaints\u201d and called on senior members to act.\nMs Whitham also said misogynistic abuse \u201cnearly broke\u201d her after standing down as drugs minister last year citing post-traumatic stress.\nMs Forbes said she had spoken to both women, but admitted she was \u201cunsurprised\u201d by their experiences.\nShe added that women across the political spectrum faced misogynistic abuse, and said it was not exclusive to the SNP or Scotland as a whole.\nShe said: \u201cIn terms of being in frontline politics, I don\u2019t think there is any surprise that there is misogyny across the public square.\n\u201cThis is an issue right across perhaps western democracies we are struggling with enormously, with social media, with the polarising and intoxicating nature of our politics and I think if you recall it was one of the reasons that Nicola Sturgeon said that she was standing down.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a much bigger problem and one that those of us who are in senior roles within government and who are women need to do as much as we can to root out.\n\u201cAnd we also need to be a role model for other women, because the biggest risk therefore is that other women don\u2019t want to stand in politics.\u201d\nThe SNP experienced a disastrous election night, dropping from 48 MPs to just nine.\nMs Forbes said the election had been fought on a \u201cchange\u201d agenda with voters focused on unseating the Conservative government at Westminster.\nBut she refused to lay the blame at the door of First Minister John Swinney, who only became leader two weeks before Rishi Sunak called the ballot.\n\u201cI do think we need to change in ensuring our policy agenda matches the public's priorities,\u201d she said.\n\"I think it's allowing John Swinney - who was only in post two weeks before the election was called, I think I was in post 10 days - to set out and deliver on his agenda of tackling poverty, of economic growth, of ensuring our public services are robust and resilient.\n\"And then perhaps the third one is, I'm a democrat and the secret ballot never lies, and therefore we need to take on board the message that the public have sent us in preparation for (the Scottish elections in) 2026.\"",
    "Plans for a sand and gravel quarry in Hertfordshire are to be considered by a planning inquiry, after an appeal was lodged against their refusal.\nAn application to extract about eight million tonnes of material from the site of the former Hatfield Aerodrome, was turned down by Hertfordshire County Council earlier this year.\nAlmost six months later, an appeal from developers Brett Aggregates has been lodged with the Planning Inspectorate.\nA hearing, scheduled for November, will be the second time that plans for the site, which sits between Ellenbrook and Smallford, have been subject to an inquiry.\nIn 2021, Brett Aggregates challenged the refusal of an earlier application for a quarry on the site and were unsuccessful.\nThe latest application sought permission to extract material over 32 years and to bring in \u201cinert waste\u201d to reinstate ground levels, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nIt included plans for a new access on to the A1057, an aggregate processing plant and other facilities, but unlike the previous application it did not include a \u201cconcrete batching plant\u201d.\nThe proposals also allowed for a phased approach, meaning areas of the site would be accessible to ramblers, dog walkers and others throughout the 32 year period.\nIn refusing the application, Hertfordshire County Council had highlighted eight reasons, which focussed on the impact on the Green Belt, heritage, residential amenity, landscape character, biodiversity, public access, the highway and groundwater.\nA council spokesman confirmed that an appeal against the Development Control Committee\u2019s refusal had been lodged.\n\"In due course we will be presenting our outline of the case to the Planning Inspectorate in accordance with their timetable by 6 August,\" he said.\nThe last Planning Inquiry that considered the previous application for a quarry on the former Hatfield Aerodrome site was held in November 2021 \u2013 with the Inspector publishing his decision in January 2022.\nAnd council officers have previously described the latest application as  being \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the first.\nBrett Aggregates has been approached for comment.\nThe inquiry is due to start on 19 November and scheduled to last for 10 days.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "An annual July snow patch survey on some of Scotland's highest mountains has recorded the third lowest total in 50 years.\nIain Cameron, who takes part in the research and also writes about snow conditions, said just 90 were logged on Monday.\nSome of the highest figures were seen in 1977 - almost 3,000 - while in 1979 and 1986 more than 2,000 were recorded.\nBut this century numbers have plummeted as low as 21 (2003) and 53 (2017).\nMr Cameron described the patches as a barometer of climate change and admitted counting so few this summer had been an \"unpleasant experience\".\nThe survey has data going back to 1974 and it includes details on hills around Drumochter and Glenshee, as well as some of Scotland's highest mountains such as Cairn Gorm, Ben Macdui and Braeriach.\nThe patches are areas of snow that have survived since winter or spring through to summer, and can be 200m in length or longer and as small as 20cm.\nSome can survive from one winter to another.\nMr Cameron said there was a downward trend in patches.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \"I am inured to the low numbers now to an extent, but I am old enough to remember when we used to get far more patches of snow.\n\"It is an unpleasant experience to count so few of them.\"\nHe added: \"I believe in 50 to 100 years time patches of snow will be a distant memory.\n\"Hopefully researchers in the future will be able to look to our research and get a lot of value from it, and probably be shocked to know snow was able to last all year round in Scotland once upon a time.\"\nLast year, avalanche forecasters said they were seeing likely impacts of climate change high in Scotland's mountains.\nThe Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) said conditions were changing more rapidly and avalanches occurring in tighter spaces of time.\nIt said named storms - such as 2021's Storm Barra - brought short, significant periods of \"proper winter\", raising the avalanche risk.\nThe storms have often been followed by rising temperatures and snow loss.\nBut SAIS warned that even in those \"leaner\" times when there was less snow potential hazards remained, often higher up towards the top of a coire, gully or mountain summit.",
    "A union representing workers at South Korean technology giant Samsung Electronics has called on its roughly 30,000 members to go on strike indefinitely, as part of its campaign for better pay and benefits.\nThe announcement came on the last day of a three-day general strike being held by the National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU).\nThe union said it had made the decision after management showed no intention of holding talks over its demands.\nThe NSEU, which represents nearly a quarter of Samsung Electronics' workers in South Korea, said its actions had disrupted production. Samsung has disputed these claims.\n\"Samsung Electronics will ensure no disruptions occur in the production lines. The company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union,\" the firm told BBC News.\nHowever, the union said: \"The company has no intention to engage in a dialogue even after the first general strike, thus we declare a second general strike starting from July 10th, lasting indefinitely.\"\nThe NSEU said about 6,500 workers have been taking part in the strike so far and called on more of its members to join the industrial action.\nA spokesperson for Samsung Electronics declined to comment on how many workers had joined the walkout.\nA protest on Monday was attended by around 3,000 people.\n\"In our view, there will be no production disruption,\" Jung In Yun, from Fibonacci Asset Management Global told BBC News.\nLast month, the union staged the first walkout at the company since it was founded five and a half decades ago.\nSamsung Electronics is the world's largest maker of memory chips, smartphones and televisions.\nIt is the flagship unit of South Korean conglomerate Samsung Group.\nThe firm is also the biggest of the family-controlled businesses that dominate Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy.\nSamsung Group was known for not allowing unions to represent its workers until 2020, when the company came under intense public scrutiny after its chairman was prosecuted for market manipulation and bribery.\nAfter the NSEU announcement, the company's shares were trading flat to slightly lower on the Korea Stock Exchange.\nLast week, Samsung Electronics said it expects its profits for the three months to June 2024 to jump 15-fold compared to the same period last year.\nA boom in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has lifted the prices of advanced chips, driving up the firm's forecast for the second quarter.",
    "A woman who is paralysed from the chest down is helping scientists in York develop a robot so people with mobility issues can receive breast screening.\nJane Hudson, 53, from Harrogate, was unable to get an accurate mammogram  because she could not get into the right position for the X-ray machine. She was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months later.\nScientists at the University of York have now started working on a prototype robotic arm system which will support the patient's upper body weight.\nMs Hudson said: \"I've faced many difficulties and challenges in the wheelchair and you do sometimes feel like you don't get listened to, so for something positive to come out of this is great.\"\nBreast screening uses a test called mammography which involves taking X-rays of the breasts. \nScreening can help to find breast cancers early when they are too small to see or feel.\nMs Hudson was invited for a mammogram at York Hospital because it was accessible but she was unable to position herself correctly in the machine for an X-ray to take place.\nShe said: \"I did feel really humiliated. It takes a lot to upset me and I did feel very upset when I left the hospital that day because I just felt this is a regular screening for any woman and yet again a disability is stopping that from happening.\"\nA few months later Jane was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer which had spread to her lymph nodes. \n\"That's when I started thinking if this had been picked up earlier maybe it wouldn't have spread,\" she said.\nShe contacted Dr Roisin Bradley, a consultant radiologist at York and Scarborough NHS Trust who is the Director of Breast Screening for North Yorkshire, to complain about the lack of accessibility for breast screening.\nDr Bradley said: \"Jane's passion stuck with me and I felt there must be something that we can do to make mammography more accessible.\"\nShe found out about the work that Dr Jihong Zhu was carrying out in the Robot Assisted Living Lab in the Institute for Safe Autonomy at the University of York and asked if he could help.\nDr Zhu, who had previously developed assistive dressing robots for use in social care, visited the hospital to observe the breast screening process and then set to work.\nHe said: \"My hope is that my robot can help people, that's the ultimate goal of my lab. When Roisin came to me with this problem, that's what I would like my robot to do so I got really excited about this.\"\nThe robot takes the weight of the patient and adjusts their body into the right position for the X-ray to be taken.\nIt would benefit people with paralysis, people who have had strokes, those with limited upper body strength and people with severe disabilities.\nDr Zhu said he hoped his robot would be fully functional and safety-checked within the next three years.\nDr Bradley said: \"For the severely disabled that haven't been able to get any mammograms, there's also a cohort of women that have got mammograms but they're just not quite as good as they could have been because of their physical difficulties so hopefully we'll be able to get better screening tests for them.\"\nMs Hudson said: \"This new project has the potential to change the future of screening and offers a lot of hope for people with paralysis like mine.\n\"I am delighted to be part of the project to help develop the robot.\"\n",

    "\"I have a very na\u00efve attitude before I put music out,\" says Camila Cabello.\n\"I think because I love it so much and I think it\u2019s good, everybody\u2019s going to love it.\"\nCamila's just released her fourth studio album C,XOXO.\nAs someone who's been in the public eye since she was 15, it's not exactly a first for her.\nBut she tells BBC Newsbeat that the more experimental sound of her latest meant she felt \"a little bit more nervous\" than usual.\nCamila started out as a member of girl group Fifth Harmony before going solo and finding success with a Latin-influenced pop sound.\nHer best-known tracks, Havana and Se\u00f1orita, have had billions of plays on Spotify.\nSo C,XOXO was a potentially risky departure for the 27-year-old, but it's one that's led to collabs with rappers Drake, Lil Nas X and Playboi Carti.\n\"It\u2019s a testament to 'what\u2019s the worst that can happen?',\" says Camila. \"And I had that energy throughout this album.\"\nCamila's also been braver recently when it comes to speaking about her mental health and living with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nShe says it's a \"complicated\" subject she can be \"hesitant to talk about\", especially around taking medication and the stigma that can come with it.\nCamila says she feels privileged to have had access to \"things that have made my life a lot easier\", such as tools, therapy, and medication.\nBut at times, particularly in her early 20s, Camila says she's felt guilty for not feeling great despite being a globally famous pop singer. \n\"One of my favourite things about getting older and experiencing life is this persistent sense of irony,\" she says. \n\"Where what you see a lot of time is not the reality.\"\n\"I think it just goes to show you how complex we are and how complicated we are as humans that it's not really black and white.\"\nCamila says she still has bad days but practising \"self-compassion\" has helped her.\n\"I think it's really treating yourself with kindness and love,\" she says.\n\"The more empathy, less judgement and the more compassion you have for yourself, and for your own difficult emotions, the more that you'll have that empathy and space for other people.\"\nCamila was born in Havana to a Cuban mum and Mexican dad, and moved between both countries until she was six, when the family settled in Miami, Florida.\nShe says talking openly about how she was feeling didn't always come naturally.\n\"Latin families - or immigrant families - don\u2019t a lot of the time have the bandwidth for realising what their mental health is,\" she says.\n\"They\u2019re so focused on survival and it\u2019s just not on their radar.\n\"That was a big part, probably in the beginning for me, the confusion of my own guilt and shame of 'I should be great'.\"\nFamily is an important pillar in Camila\u2019s life.\nHer previous album, Familia, written during the Covid pandemic, explored her Latin roots and how her family inspired her work ethic.\nShe says that's filtered into making C,XOXO.\n\"My mum is the definition of so hard-working,\" says Camila. \n\"If I\u2019m working, she\u2019s like working,\" she says.\nShe says her mum, like lots of \"immigrant parents\", is constantly \"trying to improve and create\".\n\"They just have that kind of hustle mentality. And I really had to have that for this album.\"\nCamila says she and her team spent 10 days in the Bahamas recording the album, and \"barely saw the sunlight because we were in the studio the whole time\".\n\"Anytime you are trying to make something great, it\u2019s insanely hard,\" she says.\n\"I remember just being so frustrated and was exhausted.\"\nBut some things came a bit easier.\nGetting Drake involved simply \"started with a DM\", and wasn\u2019t actually a request to \"do a song\" at first.\n\"At that time, I really genuinely was looking for friendship and connections with other artists in the music industry, because I had been such a hermit for so long,\" Camila says.\n\"I just felt like kind of antisocial.\n\"This album, I kind of spread my wings a little bit more.\"\nWhen Camila speaks to Newsbeat it's just after her Glastonbury appearance, and she's just woken up from a nap with her mum.\nShe says she's \"still recovering\" from her Other Stage set \"and pretty sure I\u2019m getting sick\".\nBut once she's feeling better, Camila says she wants to spread those wings even further, and \"just wants to have shows in the UK\".\n\"They were so loud and everyone was so kind.

    "At least eight people have died after Hurricane Beryl slammed into south-east Texas and Louisiana, knocking out power for nearly three million people.\nBeryl hit the southern United States on Monday morning as a category one hurricane, but it has since been downgraded to a tropical depression.\nOfficials warned of destructive winds, up to 15in (38cm) of rain and \"life-threatening\" storm surges.\nMore than 1,100 flights were cancelled at Houston's main airport on Monday, according to flightaware.com.\nSome 2.3 million customers in Texas were without power as of Tuesday morning, said poweroutage.us, with some cuts also reported in Louisiana and Arkansas. \nCenterPoint Energy, a Texas-based utility provider, said it planned to restore power for at least one million customers by the end of Wednesday.\nThe storm also caused major destruction and at least 10 deaths in the Caribbean.\nIn the US, officials said seven people had died in Texas's Harris and Montgomery counties, while one more fatality was confirmed in neighbouring Louisiana. \nA 53-year-old man died after winds downed power lines and knocked a tree on to his home in Harris County, causing his roof to collapse. \nIn the same county, which includes parts of Houston, 73-year-old grandmother Maria Loredo was reported dead after a tree crashed through the roof of her home, according to CBS affiliate KHOU.\nLoredo's family told the news station she was home with her son, his wife, and her two grandchildren, ages two and seven, when the tree fell. No other family members were injured.\nAlso in Harris County, a Houston Police Department employee, Russell Richardson, 54, drowned after attempting to drive through high water on his way to work, according to Houston police.\nAnother person died in a house fire that is believed to have been sparked by lightning, Houston's mayor said.\nThree people were also killed in Montgomery County. Officials say one man was killed when a tree fell on him while he was driving a tractor, and two homeless people died when a tree fell on their tent, reports KHOU.\nHouston is a low-lying coastal city, making it prone to flooding. \nSustained wind speeds in the Houston area reached 75mph (120km/h) with wind gusts reaching 87mph as the storm struck.\nBeryl is expected to continue to lose strength as it gradually tracks north-northeast, but flash flooding and heavy rain remain a risk, according to the National Hurricane Center.\nIn Louisiana, where over 20,000 people were without power due to the storm on Tuesday morning, one person was killed on Monday when a tree fell on her home in the town of Benton, according to a local sheriff.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) said Beryl spawned a tornado on Monday in Louisiana. \nOn Tuesday, the risk of twisters shifts to Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, said forecasters. \nThe ports of Corpus Christi, Houston, Galveston, Freeport and Texas City were all closed. \nMore than 2,500 emergency responders have been made ready to deal with Beryl's  aftermath, including members of the Texas National Guard. \nBeryl was expected to move east across America's central states, including Mississippi, later in the week. \nIt was forecast to skip central and west Texas, areas currently experiencing moderate to severe levels of drought. \nAt one stage, Beryl became the earliest category five hurricane ever recorded.\nIn the Caribbean it hit St Vincent and the Grenadines, Mayreau and Union, and Grenada especially hard.\nThe storm was also one of the most powerful to ever pummel Jamaica.\nBeryl brought heavy rain to the tourist hotspots of Canc\u00fan and Tulum in southern Mexico. \nWhile it is difficult to attribute specific storms to climate change as the causes are complex, exceptionally high sea surface temperatures are seen as a key reason why Hurricane Beryl has been so powerful.\nIt is the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season but the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",

The water company said it was \"disappointed\" but the \"low level of sentence\" reflected that \"this was not a significant failure\".\nThe Environment Agency said it was the first conviction of its kind that it had brought against a water company and set a precedent for the regulation of non-compliant companies.\nThe agency said it had served several statutory requirements for records on Anglian Water Services Ltd and it had been convicted of failing to respond to one of these notices, served between January 2022 and January 2023.\nThe water company had entered a plea of not guilty to the charge, claiming that it had a reasonable excuse for non-compliance but the district judge, Kenneth Sheraton, rejected this claim.\nThe case against Anglian Water Services Ltd arose out of a wider criminal investigation involving ten English water companies looking into potential non-compliance with environmental permit conditions at more than 2,000 wastewater treatment works, the agency said.\nAnglian Water said it had been found not guilty of \"two more serious charges\" of failing to provide data\nIn a statement, it said that the \u00a325,000 fine on the remaining charge was \"proportionate and takes into account our arguments in this case\".\n\"Anglian Water has always maintained, and the judge concurred, that our course of action and time taken to respond with data to the Environment Agency was reasonable,\" a spokesman said.\n\"This was reflected in the fact that we were found not guilty of the two main charges.\n\"While we are disappointed with the finding in relation to the first charge, the low level of sentence reflects our view that this was not a significant failure on our part.\"\nFollow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "ScotRail has introduced a temporary timetable in a bid to avert disruption to services amid a pay dispute with staff.\nThe rail operator will slash about 600 services from Wednesday in a bid to preserve \u201ccertainty and reliability\u201d after four unions rejected a pay offer last week.\nIt led to about a quarter of services being cancelled on Sunday, with certain routes running less frequently and finishing earlier than usual.\nIt comes two years after a similar row resulted in large parts of Scotland\u2019s rail network being shut down over the summer months.\nScotRail said about 1,660 trains would operate between Mondays and Saturdays under the provisional measures.\nIt warned that peak-time services in the morning and late afternoon would have their frequency halved from four trains per hour to two.\nThey include routes between Edinburgh and Glasgow, while those heading north of the central belt will also be vastly reduced.\nScotRail\u2019s service delivery director, Mark Ilderton, urged passengers to check their journeys before setting off.\n\u201cWe are very sorry to customers for the disruption to services,\" he said.\n\u201cWe are operating services which the vast majority of customers use and are still using all the available trains in our fleet so customers can continue to travel.\n\u201cWe want to resolve the pay dispute with the trade unions and remain fully committed to further discussions.\u201d\nTrain drivers\u2019 union Aslef informed ScotRail on Friday it was considering a ballot for industrial action in the pay dispute.\nIn the meantime, a number of drivers have refused to work extra Sunday shifts and overtime, which has had an impact on services.\nUnite, RMT and TSSA also rejected the pay increase offer tabled by ScotRail on Friday.\nScotRail managing director Joanne Maguire said lessons had been learned from previous strikes and the timetable put in place was \u201cthe most reliable\u201d possible with current staffing levels.\nShe added the operator was working to ensure the impasse between the unions was bridged.\nBut she denied that ScotRail was overly reliant on rest day working.\nMs Maguire said: \u201cThe fact that this timetable has over 100 more services per day than we had two years ago demonstrates progress and proves we are less reliant on rest day working.\n\u201cWe have been working really hard to negotiate a pay deal that is fair to our working staff but also still provides value for money to the taxpayer.\u201d\nThe publicly-owned firm was embroiled in a long-running dispute with unions in the summer of 2022.\nIt resulted in hundreds of services being cancelled and the rail network grinding to a halt in large parts of the country.\nThe rail operator said it was attempting to recruit 160 new train drivers in order to improve reliability.\nBut Aslef accused the Scottish government of failing to address driver shortages and pay issues.\nThe union\u2019s Scottish organiser, Kevin Lindsay, said: \"Rather than slashing the timetable in an act of economic vandalism that will impact towns and cities across Scotland as well as Scotland's rail passengers, ScotRail and the Scottish government must get serious about pay and urgently get back round the negotiating table with a serious and credible offer.\n\u201cThe Scottish government and ScotRail need to understand quickly that investment in our railways includes investing in its most precious resource, its workers.\n\u201cWe urge them to come back to us with an offer that is serious and that treats our members with the fairness and respect they deserve.\u201d\nScottish Conservative transport spokesman Douglas Lumsden said the timetable was a \"blow\" to rail passengers. \n\u201cThe reduction in services will have a major impact on people getting to and from work as well as those looking to journey by train during the school summer holidays,\" he said.\n\u201cThe SNP cannot hide behind ScotRail and must take responsibility for failing to tackle this situation before it reached this point.\"\nHe added: \u201cWith major sporting events and music festivals happening imminently, it is imperative that John Swinney and his SNP colleagues get a grip of this dispute, before it deeply damages Scotland\u2019s economy.\"\nTransport Scotland said that train planning and staff rotas were operational matters for ScotRail, but it expected any timetable to provide \"the best reliability and availability\" for passengers.\nThe spokeswoman added: \u201cWe acknowledge the desire of rail unions to negotiate a fair settlement for their members.\n\u201cScotRail, as a public body and the employer, has responsibility and the ability to negotiate within the limits of public sector pay

    "Serial rapist Andrew Barlow could be moved to a lower security jail, after a recommendation by the Parole Board.\nBarlow, previously called Andrew Longmire, from Bolton, was handed a 12th life sentence in 2010, having already been sentenced to 11 in 1988.\nHe attacked young women, mainly in Manchester, in the 1980s.\nThe Parole Board has made the recommendation to move 68-year-old Barlow to an open prison, a decision that comes after Barlow was sent back to jail last year for breaching his licence conditions, just months after being released.\nThe Parole Board had rejected an application from the then deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab to cancel Barlow's scheduled release.\nSince then, Barlow has faced a fresh parole review.\nThe Parole Board found the risk of Barlow carrying out another sex attack was \"very high\", according to papers released on Wednesday.\nA summary of the panel's decision said: \"After considering the circumstances of his offending, the progress made while in custody and on licence, and the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel was not satisfied that release at this point would be safe for the protection of the public.\n\"The panel was not persuaded that it could rely on Mr Barlow to be open and honest with those managing him on licence.\n\"However, on considering the criteria for recommending placement in open conditions, the panel recommended that Mr Barlow should be progressed in this way. \n\"It considered that he would present a low risk of absconding from an open prison and that a move to open conditions would allow him the chance to show that he can be trusted.\"\nThe Justice Secretary now has to decide whether to accept the Parole Board's recommendation.\nBarlow was jailed for life in 1988 with a minimum term of 20 years for 11 rapes, three attempted rapes and a string of other crimes.\nYears later he was also found guilty of two more attacks, having targeted women in their late teens and young mothers, mainly, in Manchester in the 1980s.\nHe broke into his victims' homes, using weapons to threaten them - and in one case to cause injury - before assaulting them, often while children were in the same house.\nThe 68-year-old will be eligible for another parole review in about a year's time.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A judge in Florida has ordered the surprise release of graphic transcripts from the state's 2006 prosecution of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein - a probe that ended with the millionaire financier receiving a legal slap on the wrist. \nEpstein cut a deal in 2008 to avoid charges of sex trafficking and rape. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.\nThe nearly 200 pages of documents contain details of Epstein's crimes, including first-hand accounts from victims and specifics about payoffs to underage victims.\nWhen prosecutors made that deal, they knew he had sexually assaulted teenage girls two years before, according to the transcripts.\nOn Monday, Circuit Judge Luis Delgado ordered the 16-year-old documents released, writing that \"details in the record will be outrageous to decent people\".\n\"The testimony taken by the Grand Jury concerns activity ranging from grossly unacceptable to rape \u2014 all of the conduct at issue is sexually deviant, disgusting, and criminal.\"\nReferring to Epstein as \"the most infamous pedophile in American history\", the judge added that the state's leniency in the case \"been the subject of much anger and has at times diminished the public's perception of the criminal justice system\".\n\"Epstein is indeed notorious and infamous and is widely reported to have flaunted his wealth while cavorting with politicians, billionaires, and even British Royalty,\" he continued. \n\"It is understandable that given those reports the public has a great curiosity about what was widely reported by news (agencies) as 'special treatment' regarding his prosecution.\"\nA grand jury investigation into Epstein's rape and trafficking of teenage girls at his mansion in Palm Beach began in 2006, two years before his plea deal.\nThat controversial deal has long been criticised as too favourable to him and a missed opportunity to put him behind bars.\nThe release of the files came on the same day that a new Florida law took effect permitting grand jury documents from 2006 to be released. Grand jury documents are normally never made public.\nConvicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor, Epstein had moved in social circles that included key figures in the world of business and politics. Those figures included people like former presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton to celebrities and even Prince Andrew. \nNew scrutiny of Epstein began in 2018 after the Miami Herald published interviews with Epstein victims, including some who were seeking civil charges against him.\nThe renewed interest in the case led prosecutors to file new criminal charges.\nEpstein took his own life in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting trial over federal sex-trafficking charges.\nHis accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year sentence for helping Epstein carry out sex trafficking crimes.",
    "June's weather may have felt erratic at times - but for some social media users, there was nothing random about it. They wrongly blamed it on \"weather manipulation\" and \"geoengineering\". Others accused weather presenters of \"hiding the truth\" from the public.  \nMuch of June experienced temperatures about 2C (3.6F) lower than average, due to colder air coming from the Arctic.\nThat was reversed in the last week of the month as warmer air moved in, bringing the UK temperature closer to normal, but still 0.4C colder than average.\nCombined with one of the wettest winters in recent years, this has left many wondering what is going on with the British weather.\nBut not all possible explanations circulating on social media are grounded in scientific evidence.\nTo some users, the recent cooler weather suggests climate change may not be real. But short-term weather events are not representative of long-term climate trends in the UK.\nAnd recent decades have also proved warmer, wetter, and sunnier than those in the 20th Century, as the climate continues to change.\nBut among those who deny the existence of climate change, an alternative theory has been gaining momentum. It alleges that the government is supposedly controlling both weather and climate for sinister purposes.\nVariations of this narrative have been circulating online for years, but in the aftermath of unusual weather events it tends to resurface on all major social media platforms.\nBy using social media analytics tools, BBC Verify found that conversation around these topics has been gaining momentum this year. \nSince January, mentions of #GeoEngineering on X more than doubled worldwide, compared with the last six months of 2023. \nBBC Verify found thousands of tweets spreading falsehoods and conspiracy theories. \nThese claims often lump together processes that are largely different from each other, such as weather modification and geoengineering.\nThe most well-known form of weather modification is cloud seeding - a technique through which tiny particles are released into existing clouds to produce rain or snow.\nCloud seeding has been around for decades, and has been deployed in places like the US, China and the United Arab Emirates, mostly to help tackle water shortages.\nOn social media, some users have claimed that high levels of rainfall across the UK could only be explained by the deployment of cloud seeding on an industrial scale.\nThis is false.\nOn a rapidly warming planet, warm air is able to hold more moisture, which in turn fuels more intense rainfall.\nClimate change may not be the only factor behind the UK\u2019s waterlogged winter, but it has certainly played an important role in it.\nWhile the UK government funded cloud seeding experiments in the 1950s, the Met Office says it is not aware of any activity connected to weather modification taking place in the UK in recent years.\nIn addition to that, cloud seeding can only have small, targeted impacts. It does not affect long-term weather or the climate.\nThat is where the idea of geoengineering comes in.\nGeoengineering is an umbrella term most commonly used to describe attempts to manipulate the environment, with the goal of reducing the effects of climate change.\nUnder current climate policies, the Earth is likely to heat up by more than 1.5C in the next few decades, breaching a key climate threshold.\nAs the clock ticks away, some scientists believe governments should be looking into alternative methods of cooling the Earth.\nThis could involve capturing and removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - something the UK is actively researching.\nBut there is no evidence to suggest that removing gases like carbon dioxide has any impact on short-term weather.   \nCooling the Earth could also be achieved through solar radiation management - a process through which some of the Sun's energy that reaches Earth is reflected back into space.\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says the UK government is \u201cnot deploying solar radiation management\u201d and that it has \u201cno plans to do so\u201d.\nAnd yet, some social media users claim, without evidence, that a cover-up is taking place - one in which BBC Weather and other forecasters are playing a key role (or so those users allege).\n\u201cImagine watching the geoengineers at work, and you report the weather without telling the truth about what really is going on,\u201d wrote one user on X. \u201cThat is sick!\u201d\nMany of these users were also found to frequently tweet about \u201cchemtrails\u201d, a widely debunked conspiracy theory about a secretive plot to spray people with dangerous chemicals.\nThe Royal Meteorological Society condemns the abuse weather forecasters have been receiving - which, it says, can have chilling effects.\n\u201cWe work very closely with young scientists to encourage them to share their science with the public,\u201d says Prof Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society. \u201cBut they are fearful of the trolling that might take place.\u201d\nOthers argue that it may also a",
    "A learner driver spent nearly \u00a31,400 and about 60 hours in trying to pass their driving theory test.\nThe candidate, from Redditch, notched up the highest number of unsuccessful attempts made in 2023 for one person, 59, before finally passing the test.\nNew government figures also show a total of 93,204 UK practical driving tests taken in the year to the end of March, were at least a candidate's sixth attempt to pass.\nFigures were released as it was revealed that driving test fees could increase for learners who have failed multiple times.\nThe RAC Foundation said it would encourage them to wait until they were ready to pass, easing the \"unacceptable\" test backlog, which often forces candidates to wait \"many months for a slot\".\nThe success rate for those taking at least their sixth test was 41.4%, compared with an average pass rate across all tests of 47.9%.\nAA Driving School said the average wait time for a practical driving test was more than 18 weeks.\nCoronavirus lockdowns had prohibited driving tests taking place, resulting in a backlog of candidates that is still being addressed.\nRAC Foundation director Steve Gooding, said as learners continue to wait for a test their ability to drive will decline in quality.\n\n\"In part, these jams are being caused by people who have failed multiple times and come back to take a test that might be their fourth, fifth or sixth attempt, or even greater,\" Mr Gooding said.\n\"An improved pass rate would help drive down the understandable backlog, and if you incentivise people to pass first time there is also a case for adding a modest premium to the test fee for those who have already failed on several occasions.\"\nMr Gooding said the introduction of higher fees would deter people from throwing themselves back into tests without being ready.\n\"A higher fee might persuade them not to resit their test until they are more likely to pass,\" he said.\n\"If you can improve the pass rate, this means more learners avoiding the financial and time costs associated with repeated disappointments at the test centre.\"\nLast year, the Driving Standards Agency (DVSA) increased the the length of time candidates who fail the practical test have to wait before rebooking, from 10 to 28 days, in the hope of encouraging them to wait until they are ready to pass.\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A teacher has been prevented from teaching indefinitely after a panel found he had requested, received and paid for video of a sexual nature from children. \nBilly Hart, 28, was a teacher at the City of Peterborough Academy in Peterborough between February 2020 until he was suspended in March 2021. \nThe Teaching Regulation Agency panel found he had breached a number of standards including treating pupils with dignity and his conduct \"fell significantly short of the standards expected\". \nAfter Mr Hart was arrested in June 2021 on suspicion of causing or inciting the exploitation of a child, police said no further action would be taken. \nMr Hart admitted the allegations against him - that he corresponded with two children using social media and requested, offered payment, paid and received a video from the children. \nIt was proved by the panel this video was of a sexual nature showing a child tied up with a blanket round their legs, and his behaviour was found to be of a sexual nature or was sexually motivated. \nThe panel said there was a \"strong public interest consideration\" for the safeguarding and wellbeing of the pupils as the findings of the misconduct were of a sexual nature and involved children. \nIt also found that with the evidence available Mr Hart did not \"demonstrate any remorse for his conduct\" and did not co-operate with the police investigation when he was arrested. \nThe panel said the 28-year-old refused to be interviewed due to Covid-19 and refused to provide passwords for the devices which were seized. \nIt concluded that the lack of remorse meant there would be a risk of this behaviour repeating, risking the wellbeing of pupils. \nWhile Mr Hart was a young and inexperienced teacher, the panel believed the risk of this behaviour repeating would decrease once he had the opportunity to mature and engage in a significant level of safeguarding training and rehabilitation. \nThe panel decided that Mr Hart was prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. \nA prohibition order was given to Mr Hart which would then be reviewed in three years' time to prevent risk of this happening in the future.\nA spokesperson for Greenwood Academies Trust, of which the City of Peterborough Academy is a part, said: \"We are committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for our entire school community, and as part of this uphold the highest standards of behaviour and professional conduct. \n\"In supporting these commitments, as soon as we became aware of these allegations, we took immediate action and worked with the appropriate authorities to support the investigation and take appropriate safeguarding steps.\" \nThe trust has encouraged anyone with concerns to contact the academy directly for support. \nFollow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Bestselling author Holly Jackson shares her secrets for plotting a modern murder mystery - and explains how true crime has influenced her.\nFor the author of A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, the process of writing a whodunnit is as meticulous as investigating a crime.\n\"I am obsessive about it,\" she says. \"I don't quite have a 'murder board' because it's not on the wall, but it is on the floor.\"\nEach scene in one of Holly's books corresponds to an index card, which is then carefully placed into columns for each act in the story. The author admits this \"does rather take over the room\".\nWhile this is great for planning a storyline, Holly says opening her office door a \"bit too ferociously\" can literally blow her plot out of place. \nA Good Girl's Guide to Murder has now been turned into a BBC drama by lead writer Poppy Cogan, with Holly serving as executive producer. The first episode will air on BBC One at 21:15 BST on Thursday. \nThe series follows plucky heroine Pip Fitz-Amobi as she investigates a closed murder case. Pip soon finds a co-detective in Ravi Singh, whose brother was implicated in the crime.\nEach clue, twist and turn in the story has been thoroughly discussed by Holly's fans on TikTok; the hashtag for A Good Girl's Guide to Murder - #agggtm - has more than 58,000 posts.\nThe Guardian called the series a \"very modern Nancy Drew,\" with fans on TikTok praising the show, stitching their reactions with clips from the new series. \nThe BBC spoke to Holly about the process of writing her hit novel. \"Obviously, I love murder,\" she says, \"fictional murder.\" \nHolly, 31, from Buckinghamshire, published her debut in 2019. She won a British Book Award the following year and has sold millions of copies around the world.\nWhile her fiction fits into the young adult category, Holly does not shy away from heavier topics, like crime. Her first novel, for example, follows the disappearance and apparent murder of a school girl.\nAnd Holly says true crime content - like the podcast Serial - became a \"very useful\" tool when writing A Good Girl's Guide to Murder. The structure of the book feels like a podcast, Holly says, adding: \"We have transcripts of dialogue the whole time.\"\nIn the sequel to Holly's first book - called Good Girl, Bad Blood - Pip even creates a true crime podcast herself.\nAnd Holly says this research tool soon seeped into her real-life. \"I can't really do anything without a true crime podcast,\" she says. \"If I'm walking the dog or washing the dishes, I need true crime in my ears.\"\nIn the last ten years, true crime series have won international acclaim: Serial won a Peabody Award in 2015 and In The Dark - a long-form investigative journalism series - became the first podcast to win a George Polk Award in 2019. And, according to The New York Times, Serial has had more 705m downloads. \nEven Holly is curious why crime is such a popular source of entertainment.\n\"Especially with young women,\" she wonders, \"is that like, an instinct in us that's trying to protect ourselves?\"\nGeorgia Hardstark is the co-host of My Favorite Murder, a US podcast that looks into historic and modern cases, with one episode covering the Dancing Plague of 1518 and the Paper Bag Killer. \nFor Georgia, part of the reason she is so interested in true crime is that it helps her feel less \"paranoid\" and validates her anxieties about life, she explains. \n\"That is at the forefront of my mind, constantly, you know, 'What's around the next corner? Are my doors locked?'\" \nFor Holly, the line between fact and fiction is clearly drawn: unlike true crime cases, she always knows \"the ending before I even write the first sentence\".\n\"I knew from the get-go who the murderer was going to be, this whole setup,\" she says. \"The slightly more complicated thing is not working out the mystery - it's working out how Pip is going to solve the mystery.\"\nIn A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, for example, Pip uses her Extended Project Qualification - an accreditation where a student independently researches a given topic - to interview suspects and keep track of clues for the case. \nWhile Holly uses true crime as a \"jumping off\" point for research, she notes the content, often used as a source of entertainment, is \"obviously, about real life people's trauma\".\nJessica Jarlvi - a \"Scandi-noir\" writer and lecturer on the University of Cambridge's Crime and Thriller Writing course - says things like true crime podcasts risk sensationalising these events.   \n\"It just puts me off,\" she says, \"whereas in fiction, you don't have to worry about that.\"\nIn Georgia's view, however, ignoring real-life crime - often with women victims - \"is to sweep it under the rug\".\nModern crime readers are \"becoming more and more demanding\", Jessica adds.\nHolly agrees: \"I don't have those passive readers, I have the really active ones who are looking to solve the mystery.\"\nOn TikTok, fans of A Good Girl's Guide to Murder share videos with their predictions and suspect lists as they read along with",

    "An Italian archbishop and staunch critic of Pope Francis has been excommunicated by the Vatican, its doctrinal office has said. \nCarlo Maria Vigano was found guilty of schism - meaning he has split from the Catholic Church - after years of fierce disagreement with the pontiff. \nThe 83-year-old ultra-conservative has previously called on the Pope to resign, accusing him of heresy and criticising his stances on immigration, climate change and same-sex couples.\nArchbishop Vigano was a senior figure in the Church, serving as papal envoy to Washington from 2011 to 2016. \nIn 2018 he went into hiding after alleging that the Pope had known about sexual abuse by an American cardinal and failed to act. The Vatican rejected the accusation.\nOver time, the archbishop became associated with US conspiracy theorists, criticising Covid vaccines and alleging a \"globalist\" and \"anti-Christian\" project by the UN and other groups - both familiar conspiratorial themes.\nOn Friday the Vatican's doctrinal office said his refusal to submit to Pope Francis was clear from his public statements.\n\"The Most Reverend Carlo Maria Vigano was found guilty of the reserved delict [violation of the law] of schism,\" the statement said, adding that he had been excommunicated - or banished  from the church.\nResponding by a post on X, the archbishop linked to the decree that was emailed to him and said:\n\"What was attributed to me as guilt for my conviction is now put on record, confirming the Catholic Faith that I fully profess.\"\nArchbishop Vigano was charged with schism and denying the pope's legitimacy last month.

    "On the frontlines, Ukrainian soldiers use a graphic term to describe the Russian tactics they face daily.\nThey call them \"meat assaults\": waves of Russian soldiers coming at their defensive positions, sometimes nearly a dozen times in a day.\nLt Col Anton Bayev of the Khartia Brigade of Ukraine\u2019s National Guard says wave after wave can arrive in just a few hours at front-line positions north of Kharkiv.\n\u201cThe Russians use these units in most cases purely to see where our firing equipment is located, and to constantly exhaust our units,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur guys stand in positions and fight, and when four or five waves of the enemy come at you in a day, which you have to destroy without end, it is very difficult - not only physically, but also psychologically.\u201d\nThis tactic has led to staggering Russian casualties since Moscow launched its latest offensive two months ago. Around 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials.\nThose attacking are normally quickly spotted by drones above and the Russians leave their dead and wounded on the battlefield, Lt Col Bayev says. \u201cTheir main task is simply meat assaults and our total exhaustion.\u201d\nThe tactic is a sign that Russia is seeking to make the most of its key advantage - numbers.\nIn Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Captain Ivan Sekach from Ukraine\u2019s 110th Brigade compares what he sees to a conveyor belt bringing Russians to be killed, although still allowing them to push forward slowly.\nRussia benefits from a significantly larger population than Ukraine. Some of those in the assaults are former prisoners, but Russia is also able to recruit through making one-off payments, sometimes thousands of dollars.\nAnd there have been complaints from the Russian side about \u201ccrippled regiments\u201d, in which wounded soldiers are forced back into fighting. One video shows dozens of men, some on crutches, appealing to their commanders because they say they are wounded and require hospital treatment, but instead are being sent back into combat.\nAll of this, Western officials say, means Moscow can keep throwing soldiers, even if poorly trained, straight on to the front lines at the same rate they are being killed or wounded.\nUkraine could not match the Russian tactics even if it had the numbers, partly due to a different attitude towards casualties. A senior general was removed in recent weeks after complaints he was using what are often called Soviet tactics - throwing people at the front lines.\n\u201cThere are a lot of criticisms because we have lost a lot of our guys because of Soviet-type mindset and strategy,\u201d says Ivan Stupak, a former Security Service officer. \u201cWe are limited with manpower. We have no other options than thinking of our people.\u201d\nIn the area around Kharkiv, Russian advances have been stopped. But in the east, Russia\u2019s attritional approach is making slow but steady advances.\n\u201cUnfortunately there are a lot of Russians. And they are trying to conduct this rolling operation centimetre by centimetre, inch by inch, 100m per day, 200m per day. And unfortunately, it's successful for them,\u201d says Stupak.\nThere is frustration in Kyiv about the pace of Western support. One senior official complains they are receiving enough help to ensure they do not lose but not enough to make sure they win.\nWestern officials acknowledge 2024 has been a tough year for Ukraine, with delays in the arrival of US military aid creating a major strain on defences which has cost territory and lives.\n\u201cIt seems like a so-called incremental approach,\u201d Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine\u2019s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told the BBC.\n\u201cWe receive little by little, and I get the impression that our Western allies give a little bit of weaponry, and they see what happens next, as if they're afraid of what they refer to as escalation.\u201d\nThe lifting of restrictions on using US weapons over the border into Russia has made a difference and helped stall Moscow\u2019s assault on Kharkiv.\n\u201cIf we have to fight with our hands tied behind our back, you know we'll be only bleeding to death,\u201d says Mr Merezhko. \u201cThat's why it's crucially important to be allowed to use long range missiles in the territory of Russia, and we already have results.\u201d\nBut a Ukrainian official said the use of longer range strikes into Russia had only been a palliative and was not fundamentally altering the dynamic of the war.\n\u201cWe are driving towards stalemate,\u201d former security service officer Ivan Stupak says,  acknowledging that this may lead eventually to the \u201cbitter pill\u201d of some form of negotiation.\nDuring a visit to Kyiv this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban suggested a ceasefire first to hasten negotiations, a position that officials in Kyiv are wary of.\n\u201cWe [are] not ready to go to the compromise for the very important things and values,\u201d Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine\u2019s President Zelensky, told reporters in Was",
    "A 17-year-old YouTuber whose piano covers of classic hit songs have won him a million followers has been inspiring primary school children to play a musical instrument.\nCole Lam and a group of friends from The Purcell School for Young Musicians in Hertfordshire spent a week with four different primary schools to create the Norfolk Primary Orchestra.\nThe initiative is part of an outreach project called Impulse led by the Bushey-based independent school.\n\"Having a social media platform has given me the confidence to pass on my experience,\" said Cole.\n\"Being able to do this is a special thing, and to know that music is safe for years to come is always good.\"\nCole is studying to be a composer and jazz pianist. \nHis natural talent was spotted as a four-year-old when his mum saw him playing a toy piano at nursery school.\nHe quickly went through the grades and then started playing public pianos at railway stations in London.\n\"I just did it as a bit of fun, but then one video I did playing Bohemian Rhapsody at St Pancras Station just blew up so I started my YouTube channel,\" he said.\n\"I'm naturally not that great with children, but it's great to know that we're inspiring young people because I would have been in their position at that age.\"\nHis take on Queen's classic anthem, posted when he was 12, has reached nearly 125 million views.\nThe clip was even re-posted on the official Queen Twitter page.\nThe spark for Impulse came from the Purcell School, but was driven by Cole and the other students.\nAlison Cox, head of composition at the school, said the students were great teachers.\n\"They badger me all the time to take them out to work in schools, so we trained them up to work with children,\" she said.\nThe idea is to give each school a section of the orchestra to work on - brass, woodwind, string and percussion - and then bring it all together with rehearsal workshops and a performance to friends and family.\n\"Primary school children need input from adult teachers... but when they get an injection of energy from young people only a few years older than themselves it really makes a difference,\" she said.\n\"Cole has all of these followers because he does things in a way that young people understand.\n\"He's energetic and enthusiastic and he's also a brilliant musician, and they relate to that.\"\nThe primary schools at Dersingham, Burnham Market, Docking and Wells-next-the-Sea have been working on the project since January alongside the Arts Society of North West Norfolk.\nJillian Davis from the society said the year-five students had 20 lessons with their tutors to get them ready for the Purcell students to come in.\n\"It brings it to another level,\" she said.\n\"Performing like this can be a life-changing experience for them.\n\"Seventy five children will benefit from this, and if only one or two take it further one day that would make it worthwhile.\n\"It's worthwhile anyway, but that would be the icing on the cake.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Calls to Gloucestershire Police are being answered \"quicker than they have ever been\", the county's Police and Crime Commissioner has said.\nThe latest figures from the office of the PCC (OPCC) show 999 calls last month were answered in just over six seconds on average, while the average wait for a 101 call has gone down from more than six minutes last year to one minute.\nIn May, police received almost 20,000 calls relating to emergencies and non-emergencies. \nThe force was criticised by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) in 2021, who rated the force as \"inadequate\" in five out of 10 key performance indicators.\nIn March 2024, another HMICFRS inspection raised \"serious concerns\" over how the force responds to the public.\nFollowing the reports the force hired more call handlers and increased training.\nThe OPCC said that a year ago, people had complained of being kept waiting on the line for so long, that they often gave up.\nBut the newly released figures, for May and June this year, show that on average, the force answered 999 calls in just over six seconds.\nThe OPCC also said the force had been consistent answering 101 calls in under two minutes since December.\nThe percentage of abandoned calls has also seen a downward trend.\nSupt Anton Campbell, current head of the constabulary's force control room, said the latest figures represented a \"very pleasing and consistent trend\".\n\"There are a number of reasons for this,\" he explained.\n\"Significant investment in the department, both in technology and staff, has made it easier for callers to reach the service they want and has also enabled us to retain more of our experienced call handlers.\"\nPCC Chris Nelson added: \"The constabulary is now quicker at answering 101 non-emergency calls than it has ever been. \n\"Average waits are now less than two minutes, which compares well with many other public services.\n\"This has been one of the areas of most concern during the last inspection by His Majesty's Inspectorate and I congratulate them on the improvements that have been made in performance.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The world's first radar station could appear on the big screen in a bid to secure its long term future.\nBawdsey Radar Transmitter Block in Bawdsey, near Felixstowe, Suffolk, began operations in September 1937 and was crucial in helping win the Battle of Britain.\nNow a museum, the Bawdsey Radar Trust runs the Grade II listed site and has teamed up with Screen Suffolk to offer it as a filming location.\nGraham Murchie, chair of the trust, said the decision would help ensure the site's preservation.\n\"As a charity we need to look at every option in terms of funding,\" he explained.\n\"Along with virtually every other museum we still haven't quite recovered to pre-Covid numbers in terms of visitors and the amount of spend.\n\"We've certainly seen the cost of living impact as well as the Covid impact.\n\"Things are getting better all the time.\"\nVarious film works have taken place at the station before but the trust hopes more producers will come forward after teaming up with Screen Suffolk.\nScreen Suffolk, set up in 2016, is the county's official film office, acting as a database as well as being able to source crews and grant permits.\nJim Horsfield, Screen Suffolk's operations and business development manager, explained Bawdsey Radar was a great site due to its remote location and history.\n\"Because it's the world's first operating radar station it's just got that unique feel to it,\" he said.\n\"We're always looking to bring on new locations... and the bunker, with the way that it is shaped and formed, it's just an interesting structure that hopefully will be used by lots of filmmakers in the future.\"\nMr Murchie explained how radar emerged following World War One when, for the first time, civilians were being killed by aircraft dropping bombs.\nThe UK government set up a committee to investigate the country's air defences should another war break out.\nPhysicist Robert Watson Watt proved it was possible to detect the presence of aircraft using radio waves.\nInitially five operational radar stations were built, including Bawdsey, which became the first Chain Home radar station linked to RAF Fighter Command.\n\"By the time [World War Two] broke out in 1939, we were ready with a radar early warning system,\" continued Mr Murchie.\n\"It meant come the time of the Battle of Britain we were able to see what was incoming in the way of attacks - we could direct our Hurricanes and Spitfires to exactly the right place. \n\"As a result of that we won the Battle of Britain - and the rest is history.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "At least one person has died after Hurricane Beryl made landfall in several countries in the Caribbean. \nThousands of people remain without power or are living in temporary shelters in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and St Lucia.\nThe hurricane was upgraded to a Category 5 and is moving west towards Jamaica. It is expected to hit south-east Mexico by the end of the week.\nImages on social media showed homes with their roofs blown off and residents picking through rubble to salvage their possessions. \nAfter Hurricane Beryl made landfall on Carriacou Island in Grenada, it became clear that several parts of the Caribbean in its path had been hit hard. \n\"In half an hour, Carriacou was flattened,\" according to Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell.\nMeanwhile, Ralph Gonsalves, premier of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said one person had died and that there could be more fatalities. \nEarlier, airports and businesses were shut down and residents urged to seek shelter as the storm approached. \nIn a news briefing on Monday, Mr Mitchell warned: \"We are not yet out of the woods.\" Grenada has also experienced several power outages, impacting communications and access to government updates.\nMaximum sustained winds for the hurricane are near 150mph (241km/h), according to the NHC's latest update, as the storm moves west. \nA hurricane watch is in effect for Jamaica, which means the region is likely to experience hurricane conditions by Wednesday. \n\"It is not a joke,\" said St Vincent and the Grenadines PM Ralph Gonsalves, reminding people of the devastation caused by past hurricanes.\nIn a national address from his official residence, Mr Gonsalves said he was seeking shelter in his basement.\n\"The roof, certainly the old part of the roof, may not survive winds at 150mph. I am making preparations to go downstairs,\" he said.\nThe hurricane was upgraded to a Category 4 on Monday after slightly weakening earlier.\nThe NHC said fluctuations in strength were likely to continue but warned that portions of the Windward islands should prepare for \"potentially catastrophic wind damage\".\nIt said St Vincent and the Grenadines as well as Grenada were at the highest risk of damage.\nHurricane shelters opened at 18:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Sunday.\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.\nIt said record high sea surface temperatures were partly to blame.\nMeteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed. \nThe storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane - Category 3 or above - in only 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told Associated Press news agency. \nMuch of the region has heeded the warnings.\nShops have closed and people have stocked up on fuel and groceries. \nGrenada issued a state of emergency and St Lucia imposed a \"national shutdown\", ordering schools and businesses to remain closed.\nAs Hurricane Beryl came barrelling towards St Vincent and the Grenadines, journalists Colvin Harry and Dionne John were running a live radio programme on the country\u2019s National Broadcasting Corporation.\nAs they discussed the storm\u2019s approach \u2013 informing the public of the latest developments, urging people to remain indoors and to heed the warnings of the authorities \u2013 their livestream showed the winds picking up quickly in the capital, Kingstown. \nAfter about an hour of the broadcast, the roof of a neighbouring building came crashing down and they had to take shelter in nearby home to ride out the storm.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to take a break as we assess our own safety here\u201d, said Colvin with typical unstated calm on air.\n\u201cWe had to literally run away from our studio\u201d, he told the BBC after the broadcast via WhatsApp messages. \u201cWe\u2019re safe in a temporary facility but from what we\u2019re hearing countless number of roofs have gone. Churches, public buildings, schools have all lost their roofs.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really bad, we\u2019ve taken a hard hit,\u201d he added.\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines is just one of the Caribbean nations in the path of the hurricane, which has increased in intensity over the past three days.\nStorms that strengthen rapidly can catch people off-guard and while the governments and the populations of the region have a lot of experience in preparing for and dealing with hurricanes, ample warning is a critical factor in keeping people safe.\nWarming ocean temperatures, caused by human activity, are making these storms more frequent and more powerful. Storms like Beryl have the potential to wreak havoc in the region bringing sustained winds, dangerous gusts and large amounts of rain onto the Caribbean islands.\nLow-lying coastal regions are also at risk of storm surges and flash flooding while mountain regions can experience landslides, especially when rain is dumped on already wet ground.\nIn this instance, it does seem that, despite the limited warning, many re",
    "Footage captured from a boat off the Isle of Mull shows a \"miracle\" white-tailed eagle chick in flight, after it was nursed back to health by two unusually caring parents.\nIn an unprecedented display of extended eagle parenting, the two white-tailed parents skipped this year's breeding season to continue to tend to their year-old offspring. \nThe youngster's wing was broken when the nest fell to the ground during unseasonably wild weather last year. \nThe footage shows a bulge in the bird's wing - apparently a healed broken bone.\nMull\u2019s RSPB officer, Dave Sexton, who described the bird as a \"miracle chick\", said: \u201cWe normally think of eagles as \u2018hard-wired\u2019 and unemotional but clearly there might be another side to their nature.\" \nIt is a story that had a stormy start, when the chick badly injured its left wing last July after its nest was blown down. \nThe young, injured eagle finally took to the skies in the autumn, but Dave Sexton described its flight as \u201cwobbly\u201d. \nThe new footage, captured by wildlife photographer Gary Jones, shows a visible lump in its wing - probably a healed broken bone. \nRSPB officer Dave spotted the juvenile this spring - alive and well and in a new nest in an area owned by North West Mull Community Woodland. \nThe fully-grown chick was being fed fish by its parents, caring behaviour that the eagle expert described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d for the birds. \n\u201cIn 30 years of watching them, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\" he said. \n\"I\u2019ve also consulted with other eagle experts at home and abroad, and so far no-one else has reported this kind of extended parenting behaviour for an injured chick.\u201d\nWhite-tailed eagles are the UK's largest birds of prey - with wingspans that can reach 2.4m. Their chicks normally hatch in April and are fed in the nest until they fledge in July. By October, most young will disperse and start to fend for themselves.\n\u201cThey wander far and wide until they\u2019re five years old and start to look for a mate and a territory of their own,\u201d Dave explained. \u201cIf an immature bird was to reappear near its nesting parents or any other pair the following year, it would likely be aggressively chased away. That\u2019s why this is so exceptional.\nFor now, Dave said, he and other local eagle-watchers are enjoying watching this \u201cunusual\u201d family doing what they want to do and caring for their youngster.\n\"I\u2019d still describe its flight as \u2018wonky\u2019 at best,\" he told BBC News. \"But you have to admire its will to survive against the odds \u2013 with a little helping hand from mum and dad. \n\u201cI loved white-tailed eagles before,\u201d he added. \u201cNow I think I love them just a little bit more.\u201d",
    "Last week Labour won a thumping majority in the general election and, with the help of Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats, cleared the Tories out of Wales' Westminster seats.\nWas the result enough to ease the problems of the under-fire First Minister, Vaughan Gething, weeks after he lost a vote of no confidence and with a split Labour group? Clearly not.\nJust days into Sir Keir Starmer's government, a minister he sacked publicly attacked him in the Senedd. \nAny sense the general election result could re-unite the Labour group quickly went away after Hannah Blythyn's speech - responded to by Mr Gething in equally dramatic fashion a day later.\nAll the while, sources have told BBC Wales that supporters of Mr Gething in the Senedd have been worried the first minister is facing an imminent leadership challenge, with rumours of Mr Gething's former rival Jeremy Miles being proposed as a replacement.\nThey have been concerned that it could come in the dying days of this current term - with the Senedd due to finish for the summer next week.\nOthers have played down the prospect. One source in the party said there's nothing in the offing, and that Mr Miles himself would not be interested in starting a challenge.\nAt the same time, with relations in the doldrums with the opposition and questions being raised about how Mr Gething can continue to govern, Labour MSs are openly asking if the Senedd could have to be dissolved for an election.\nThe decision by Mr Gething to take \u00a3200,000 for his leadership bid from a company owned by a man prosecuted twice in the 2010s for environmental offenses has been a major factor in the splits in the Labour group.\nIt is also at the heart of the poor relations that exist with Plaid Cymru and Welsh Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds.\nMr Gething has always insisted that he followed the rules around campaign donations. \nAn election is being discussed because, as things stand, there appears to be no opposition Senedd member willing to do a deal and help a Vaughan Gething budget pass. He needs at least one to abstain.\nIf nothing changes, and the party is unwilling to change its leader, then Labour could find it impossible to perform a basic function of government.\nMinisters could come to the conclusion the only way through is to hand the question of how Wales should be run over to the electorate. \nIf the opposition brought a specific vote of no confidence in the government and there was a repeat of last month's vote, that too could force an election, a source said.\nMike Hedges, Labour MS for Swansea West, openly discussed the idea during the Senedd debate on the vote of no confidence. \"Let the voters decide,\" he said.\nIt is an option fraught with potential danger for Labour. \nA recent poll by YouGov from late June and early July suggested Labour was on 27% of the vote for a theoretical Senedd election, versus 23% for Plaid Cymru, 18% for the Conservatives and 18% for Reform UK.\nOne Labour Party observer of the situation, who believes there should be a change of leadership, warned an early election would see Labour \"cleaned out\" on current polling numbers.\n\"It's the one in less than two years they should be worried about.\"\nThe details of the challenge backers of Mr Gething have been speculating about have been pretty vague, although they expected it to come after the general election.\nTwo supporters of Mr Gething, who spoke to BBC Wales prior to the general election, said talk of a leadership challenge allegedly came up in chat on the campaign trail.\nThe first backer doubted that any alternative leader would be accepted without a contest.\n\u201cThe political goodwill is not there for there to be some sort of smooth transition.\n\u201cThe group is now quite divided really. It has been through a really bruising time.\nThe supporter said the current crisis is \u201cworse\u201d than the situation between Alun Michael and Rhodri Morgan around the turn of the century.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been leaks and that\u2019s caused bad feeling - you have a meeting and a couple of hours later the meeting is reported in the media.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a new administration trying to get on with things and it is difficult to focus when there\u2019s all this stuff going on in the background.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in a brilliant place politically with some of the things in the Senedd - feedback I\u2019ve been getting on the doors is that people are cross with us on things like Senedd reform and 20mph,\" the backer added.\nBoth claimed that Jeremy Miles could have united the group - something strongly rejected by critics of Mr Gething, who say that none of the situation is the economy minister\u2019s fault.\nThe second supporter said that at \u201cany moment in time Jeremy could have united the group by saying he supported Vaughan\u201d.\n\u201cIf he\u2019s going to go in a different direction that\u2019s going to tear the group apart.\u201d\nWould Mr Gething fight any potential challenge? Both backers said he would, although the first did suggest that an interim leader could be possible. \n\u201cEveryone's got their limits,\" they said.\nT",

The Daily Telegraph reports that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak thanked his former boss just before Mr Johnson addressed Conservative supporters at the event in London - and said he was glad to have his support. \nThe paper adds that Mr Johnson had previously blamed Mr Sunak for triggering his downfall in 2022 by resigning as chancellor, but that the two \"buried the hatchet to put the Conservative Party first\".\nThe Guardian reports that senior Jewish figures have been angered by remarks made by some Conservatives - who appeared to mock Sir Keir Starmer for wanting to protect family time on Friday nights. \nThe paper quotes a former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Marie van der Zyl, saying the outrage was \u201chorribly stigmatising\u201d - as the Labour leader's wife is from a Jewish family. She added that it was important for Jewish families to observe the tradition of spending time with loved ones on Friday evenings.\nThe Financial Times reports that some wealthy individuals have started selling assets such as shares and property over fears that a Labour government could increase capital gains tax. One wealth manager, Nick Ritchie, tells the paper there is \u201ca general nervousness\" and uncertainty about Labour's intentions. \nMr Ritchie said a small number of clients were already offloading assets to make sure their gains were taxed at \u201cat a favourable 20%\u201d - but others were taking a wait-and-see approach.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nUkraine has been dealt a blow in its attempt to gain Nato membership, according to the Telegraph.

    "Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has won a third consecutive term in Sunday's gubernatorial election, securing her position for the next four years.\nMs Koike received more than 2.9 million votes - or 42.8% of the votes - in Sunday's election, beating her opponents by a wide margin.\nHer victory will be a relief for struggling Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who backed the 71-year-old in her contest as an independent candidate.\nMs Koike became Tokyo's first female governor in 2016, and won her second term in 2020. \nThe conservative governor successfully guided Japan's most populus city through the Covid-19 pandemic and its delayed summer Olympics in 2021, but also weathered controversies regarding her university credentials and infrastructure projects under her governorship. \nDeclaring victory, Ms Koike said her main challenge was \"how to proceed with digital transformation as industries have changed significantly.\"\nShe said she would consolidate efforts to keep improving Tokyo, including \"the environment for women's empowerment\", which she said was \"insufficient [in Japan] compared to other parts of the world.\" \nMs Koike's appointment makes her one of the most powerful women in Japan's male-dominated politics. She told the BBC that she won her first term \"because I [am] a woman\". \n\"People prefer to have something new, or somebody new, in order to change society,\" she said then.\nWith Tokyo accounting for about 11% of the country's population and contributing to nearly 20% of its total GDP, it also puts her in charge of the city\u2019s budget, which climbed to a staggering 16.55 trillion yen ($100bn; \u00a380bn) this fiscal year.\nShe will now also have to work hard to improve Tokyo\u2019s shockingly low birth rate, which came up as a major issue during this campaign. At 0.99 - less than one child per woman aged between 15 and 49 - it is the lowest of any region nationwide.\nIn all, 56 contenders were vying to lead the sprawling capital and a number of other cities in the prefecture. Voter turnout on Sunday was more than 60%, up from 55% in the 2020 race.\nObservers had initially expected the election to be a neck-to-neck race between Ms Koike and prominent opposition politician Renho Saito.\nUnexpectedly, Shinji Ishimaru, an independent candidate and the former mayor of Akitakata, a town in Hiroshima prefecture, placed second, a position that was long thought to be guaranteed for Ms Renho. \nMs Renho, 56, supported by the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), came in third instead. \nMr Ishimaru, 41, was relatively unknown in Tokyo before the official campaign began.\nHis success is thought to be down to his appeal among young voters. During the election campaign, he focused on boosting his profile by reaching out to his large social media following.\nAs a former banker, he also focused on advancing the economy and industry of Tokyo. \nAfter the polls closed, he told his supporters, \"I did all I could\", alluding to the fact that he had no particular party affiliation, unlike the two main contenders. \nYuriko Koike started her career as a journalist, working as a television news anchor before moving into politics in the early 1990s.\nBut it was not until 2016 that she came to true national prominence after winning the governorship of Tokyo for the first time. She was not the official candidate of LDP, but still managed to win comfortably, taking more than 2.9 million votes to become the first woman in the role.\n\"I will lead Tokyo politics in an unprecedented manner, a Tokyo you have never seen,\" Ms Koike promised supporters on election night.\nShe officially left the LDP in 2017 to set up her own political party, though she retains the support of many in the party \u2013 who gave her their backing in the 2024 race.\nMs Koike vowed to focus on local issues during her term, including tackling overcrowding on public transport, as well as the culture of overworking in the city. But it was global issues that came to dominate her time in office.\nThe emergence of Covid-19 forced Tokyo to delay its summer Olympics, planned for 2020. Ms Koike won a second term that year after her successful handling of the pandemic, and garnered further praise for managing the delayed Olympics, held in the city in 2021 in the shadow of the coronavirus.\nMs Koike, however has not escaped scandal. An allegation that she never graduated from Cairo University \u2013 first reported during her first term \u2013 has never quite died away.

    "Prospective candidates for the Legislative Council will have to fill out a formal application for the position in future in a raft of changes approved by the House of Keys.\nThe Standing Orders Committee made several recommendations to reform the process of electing members to the Manx parliament's upper chamber.\nCommittee member David Ashford said those putting their names forward being required to complete the form and provide a CV would make the process more \"transparent\".\nMHKs also supported the panel's suggestions for updates to the way the island's chief minister is elected, including full speeches and formal questions.\nThe panel decided to review the procedures as part of a wider review of standing orders after the 2021 General Election.\nUnder previous rules, those put forward for vacant seats on the Council were not required fill out a formal application.\nThe 11 members of the council, which provides scrutiny of draft new laws, include eight MLCs who are chosen by members of the House of Keys.\nThe committee was made up of Speaker of the House of Keys Juan Watterson and MHKs Mr Ashford, Claire Christian, Joney Faragher, Tim Glover and Lawrie Hooper.\nIts report it said the formal process would build on efforts to \"open up\" the procedure further to \"make it more like a conventional recruitment process\".\nInstead of lobbying individuals for support, an \"applicants\u2019 conference\u201d would  give candidates the opportunity to \"meet a large number of MHKs in a short time\", they added.\nDuring Monday's debate, Chris Thomas called for \"wholesale transformation\", which would see members selected by nomination via special interest groups, such as business and farming, to represent their interests.\nHowever, Mr Hooper said the committee's recommended reforms were a \"very small step on the journey of democratic reform\" that was \"very much overdue on this island\".\nA raft of recommendations to the process of electing the island's chief minister included contenders delivering a speech to the house, something previously only allowed by the nominee's proposer and seconder.\nMHKs will also be given more time to consider candidates' policies, with statements  submitted at the same time as candidacy is confirmed seven days before the sitting.\nMr Ashford said the changes would allow for \"proper public scrutiny of any candidates that come forward\".\nThe updates to both procedures come into effect immediately and will be put into practice the next time either form of election takes place.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

No soldiers were injured.\nFour other military horses were spooked by noise from a building site in Belgravia on 24 April and fled through the city, with some hitting vehicles including a double-decker bus.\nThe latest incident happened when the lead horse, which was being led rather than ridden, became loose after being spooked by a London bus. \nTwo riders were then unseated from their horses, who also became loose.  \nPart of the incident was captured on dashcam footage by a black cab driver.\nThe animals bolted from Seville Street to South Eaton Place, where one horse was recovered.

    "Viktor Orban arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday for an unannounced visit having just taken over as rotating president of the European Union.\nWhile in Kyiv, the Hungarian prime minister said a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine could speed up negotiations to end the war that followed Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\nMr Orban has been a critic of Western support for Ukraine and is seen as the European leader closest to Russian President Vladimir Putin. This was his first visit to Ukraine in 12 years, although he has met Mr Putin repeatedly during that time.\nDuring his joint appearance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the body language between them was not warm and neither took questions from the media after they gave their statements.\nMr Orban previously slowed agreement on a \u20ac50bn ($54bn; \u00a342bn) EU aid package designed to support Ukraine in its defence against Russia. \nBut for the next six months his position as head of the European Council means he has an influential role as a figurehead for Europe. He came to Ukraine on his second day in that role for discussions, saying there was a need to solve previous disagreements and focus on the future.\nIn his statement following their meeting, Mr Zelensky said it was \u201cvery important to have Europe\u2019s support for Ukraine maintained at sufficient level\u2026 it\u2019s important for co-operation between all the neighbours in Europe to become more meaningful and mutually beneficial\".\nIn his own statement, Mr Orban stressed the need to work together but also said he had raised the idea of a ceasefire to hasten negotiations with Russia. \n\"I have asked the president to consider whether... a quick ceasefire could be used to speed up peace negotiations... I am grateful for his frank dialogue and his answers.\"\nMr Orban also said:  \"My first trip has taken me here because the issue of peace is important not only for Ukraine, but for the whole of Europe. This war that you are suffering is deeply impacting European security.\"\nPresident Zelensky did not publicly respond to those comments.\nLater, in a post on X, the Ukrainian leader said Mr Orban's visit to Ukraine was a \"clear signal to all of us of the importance of unity in Europe and taking collective steps\".\n\"We discussed the path to a just, lasting, and fair peace.\"\nMany Ukrainians believe a ceasefire would simply cement Russia\u2019s hold over territory it has taken from Ukraine and, if negotiations were to take place, they would prefer them to be conducted from a position of strength rather than on the back foot.\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said his country was open to \"work with everyone and solve problems\".\n\"This work is difficult and time-consuming, but it eventually yields tangible results,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\u201cDuring the visit, President Zelensky had a candid but constructive discussion with Prime Minister Orban about ways to achieve a just peace, not simply a ceasefire or peace talks.\u201d\nThe two leaders also discussed bilateral issues including the 100,000 ethnic Hungarians who reside in Ukraine.\nMr Orban said the two countries were determined to put past disagreements behind them, and that he was reassured progress was being made on the rights of the ethnic Hungarians. \nHe also wished Ukraine \"every success\".\nThe EU opened membership talks for Ukraine the week before Hungary assumed the EU Council Presidency.

    "A farmer has revealed the identity of a mystery purple crop that has left people guessing on social media.\nTrevor Edgley, who runs the Nightlayer Leek Company in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire,  found himself unable to drill wheat due to persistently wet fields during the spring.\nHe said he planted a special seed mix on land off the A142 between Chatteris and Mepal - called NUM3 - which encourages insects and wildlife.\n \"I think you'll start to see a lot of it about, ours has come out early because we drilled it in April, whilst we still had some moisture in the soil,\" he said. \nPlanting NUM3 is a government \"sustainable farming incentive\" (SFI), which improves soil health and mitigates the impacts of extreme weather through rotation.\n\"The government [sustainable farming incentive] pays farmers \u00a3593 per hectare per year to grow the crop,\" Mr Edgley said.\n\"We have to pay for seed, labour and establishment costs out of that money. \n\"Spring wheat and barley are not always that profitable, so for me, it is a safe bet to sow NUM3, and it is better for the environment too.\"\nCommentators on social media believed the crop was linseed, borage or lavender.\n\"I was planning to sow wheat, but the rain has been so bad, the fields were under water till mid-March,\" Mr Edgey added.\n\"The wheat seeds have been kept in storage, we will do a germination test on them later this year, and fingers crossed, they'll make it for next year.\n\"I have about 100 acres growing this fairly new crop, NUM3, a mixture of seven seeds that is designed to encourage insects, bee's, pollinators and farmland birds it is also a way to manage nutrient efficiency and improve soil health.\"\nNUM3 seed mix is made up of 50% vetch, 15% linseed, 15% buckwheat, 7.5% crimson clover, 7.5% berseem clover and 5% phacelia - which provides the vivid purple flower.\nThe Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFR) developed the incentive (SFI) to prevent too much land being taken out of food production.\n\"Through SFI, our aim is to support farming and farmers,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"We want to protect and improve the environment, food production and food security.

    "Wali Noori was working as an interpreter for the British Army in Afghanistan in 2009 when he stepped on an explosive device. \nThe blast left him completely blind at the age of 20.  \nGrowing up, he loved running in the mountains of Kabul but Wali thought he would never be able to run again. \nHere, in his own words, he explains how moving to the UK changed his life and his determination to never give in.\nGrowing up in Kabul I was a very good boxer and I used to run to keep myself fit. I finished my studies and wanted to go to university, but my family were very poor and I needed to support them. They were starving, my father was not able to work and I have five sisters and four brothers.\nSo at the age of 18 I joined the British Army as a translator and cultural adviser. I had studied English at school and I was good at it. My job was to help the British Army, the Afghan forces and the local civilians communicate with each other and it was a very important job. \nI was asked if I would go to Helmand Province, and I said yes, even though I knew I had to accept I might die. It was like hell. So many ambushes and people were dying every day but I wasn't scared.\nI had been there for two years when I stepped on an IED (improvised explosive device) while on patrol. I was thrown up into the air and came crashing back down. I thought I must be dying but it felt like a dream. My whole face was full of shrapnel and I lost all 28 of my teeth.\nI stopped breathing but put my hand down my throat and pulled out a piece of shrapnel. I could not see anything and I was helicoptered out, before spending two weeks in a coma in an army hospital in Kabul.\nThe doctors did not expect me to survive. When I woke up, I could not speak and I had to write my name down for them, so they could call my friend who told my family what had happened.\nWhen my mum and dad came for the first time, it was very hard time for them. I managed to sit up so I would not look so poorly and I tried to smile for them, but I still could not speak.\nI was transferred to Bagram Hospital and airbase, where the Americans treated my facial wounds and fractures. I was breathing through a tube from my neck. I was there for a month before I went to hospitals in both India and Pakistan to see if they could save my sight, but it was not possible.\nIt was not easy and I had some very dark days. I used to love running but I thought my running days were over. I was a single man and I ended up living back with my family in Afghanistan. I did not know how I would get through the rest of my life and I thought no one would want to marry me.\nBut in 2012, I had an arranged marriage. From that day on my wife has been my biggest supporter. She threw away my white cane and she said \"I am your stick\". She is very kind and whenever I get sad she says \"come on, I am here\". We have three beautiful children and we are so lucky.\nI could not work while living in Afghanistan, even though I wanted to. The British Army gave me one year's salary but I was struggling and the country is not set up very well for disabled people.\nIn 2014, I was told by the British Government that I was eligible to come to the UK with my family. It took two years to sort out but since we moved to Colchester, we have never looked back.\nI really like it here. It is a nice place and I have made some lovely friends, especially at my running club, the Colchester Harriers. And we are safe.\nI realised I could start running again, because they have guide runners, and this has given me back my freedom and my mental health. I get terrible headaches due to my injuries but I go out running and my headache is forgotten.\nI waited for five years to get selected for the Invictus Games and I was so proud to represent the UK last September. I won four gold medals, in the 100m, 200m, 400m and 1500m. I met Prince Harry and Meghan and they were so warm and friendly.\nHarry shook my hand, I didn't know who he was. I said \"who is this?\" and he said \"I'm Prince Harry\" and we laughed and chatted. It was an incredible moment in my life.\nI have now won 21 medals for running and three for swimming. I always want to move forwards in my life and I never look back. I am always trying to improve and I make sure I never give up. \nMy dream is to one day compete at the Paralympic Games. I qualified for it in terms of how quick I am, and meet the criteria, but I missed the deadline to apply this time. But I will get there one day. I would also like to complete the six major marathons, having done London in 2019.\nI have just written a book about my life and it will be published on 12 September, which is 15 years to the day I went blind. I go into schools and colleges and different groups like army veterans to share my story and I recently spoke to some veterans who were injured in Ukraine. When I get money for these speeches I send it back to Afghanistan to help the widows and orphans there.\nI will never regret signing up to work for the British Army an",
    "By a landslide this UK general election has been Labour's moment, but Northern Ireland has had its own political earthquakes.\nSinn F\u00e9in was the runaway success, completing a historic hat-trick for Irish nationalism.\nFor the first time it is now Northern Ireland's largest party at Westminster, at Stormont and at local government level.\nThe party retained its seven seats and upped its vote share compared to the last general election in 2019.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in has always held a policy of abstentionism when it comes to the House of Commons and will not sit in the chamber.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which propped up the Conservative government after the 2017 election with its 10 seats, dropped to second place in a deeply bruising performance.\nIt was widely expected to come under pressure after years of unionist divisions and disillusionment over the outworkings of Brexit.\nBut few predicted the party would lose as many as three seats.\nThe single biggest shockwave was the fall of the 'house of Paisley'.\nFor 54 years North Antrim has been their family dynasty and synonymous with the DUP.\nIts founder Rev Ian Paisley held the seat from 1970 and was succeeded in 2010 by his son, Ian Paisley Jnr.\nBut now the seat is in the hands of his arch rival, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister.\nThe party lost two further seats including Lagan Valley, which former DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson had held for 27 years.\nAnd East Londonderry - usually considered a safe DUP seat - was forced to a recount. Gregory Campbell fended off Sinn F\u00e9\u00edn by a margin of just 179 votes.\nIn 2019 his majority was just shy of 10,000 votes.\nOnly DUP leader Gavin Robinson holding Belfast East prevented a damaging election turning into a full-blown crisis.\nThe party came under pressure from multiple sides, shedding votes to more liberal and hard line unionist rivals as well as the Alliance Party.\n\nIt has undoubtedly been a good election for Mr Allister, whose campaign criticised the DUP's deal in February to restore Stormont power-sharing.\nJust months ago the DUP dismissed him as a \"dead end unionist\". Now for the first time, he will be heading to Westminster.\nOn the green benches he's likely to sit alongside Nigel Farage. \nUnder the leadership of Richard Tice, Reform UK and the TUV entered into an electoral alliance, but that was later called into question when Mr Farage gave his DUP \"beer buddies\" Ian Paisley and Sammy Wilson his personal endorsement.\nThe Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) will also be celebrating after securing its first member of Parliament in seven years.\nFor Robin Swann, who switched constituencies and stepped down as Stormont health minister to contest South Antrim, the gamble paid off.\nIt was a much-needed win for UUP leader Doug Beattie, as some party members had been questioning whether his \"shrink to grow\" strategy would ever enter the \"grow\" phase.\nThere were mixed fortunes for the Alliance Party.\nSorcha Eastwood securing Lagan Valley offset the party's disappointment over deputy leader Stephen Farry losing North Down to independent unionist Alex Easton.\nBut in Belfast East, Alliance leader Naomi Long's high-profile fourth contest against the DUP fell flat.\nIn terms of votes, Alliance remains firmly Northern Ireland's third-largest party.\nBut the different results may lead to some debate over whether the so-called 'Alliance surge' since 2019 has stalled.\n\nThe Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) will be pleased to have retained its two seats, albeit with reduced majorities.\nAs the tremors of this election settle, there will be much for the parties to digest in these results.\nNorthern Ireland has nine nationalist MPs, eight unionists and one undecided on the constitutional question - the same as last time.\nOpinion polls suggest no majority support for the prospect of Northern Ireland leaving the UK to join with the Republic of Ireland.\nBut with Sinn F\u00e9in in the top spot, debate over an Irish unity referendum may grow louder.",
    "A man from West Sussex who pledged to run a marathon every day of the year to raise money for a mental health charity has reached the halfway mark.\nJames Cooper, from East Grinstead, set himself the challenge of running the 26.2 mile (42.1km) distance every day throughout 2024. \nMr Cooper, 36, said he was determined to keep going and was excited about the rest of the year ahead.\nHe said: \"I'd say you don't have to run a marathon a day to get the benefits of physical activity - but for me it's an opportunity to find time for myself. It gives a sense of peace and wellbeing.\"\nJames, who works as a personal trainer, is running to raise money for the charity Samaritans. \nDistance running has helped him to cope with his own mental health issues, including a period of depression in 2014 and 2015 which he says \"rocked me to my core.\" \nHe added: \"It has given me optimism and mental resilience. The next few months will be pleasant before we re-enter winter. \n\"I'll do what I have to do to get over the finishing line, I'm smiling every step of the way!\"\nJames's fianc\u00e9e Annabel Crisp said: \"It has been a tough year in the sense of changing our whole routine but I couldn't be prouder of him.\n\"Seeing the whole community he has created while doing the challenge has been a fantastic whirlwind.\"\nSo far he has raised just over \u00a330,000 of a \u00a3703,000 target - a pound for every life lost to suicide around the world each year, as recorded by the World Health Organization.\nJames started his marathon challenge in January by himself but has since built up a community of runners around him who want to support him and get fit themselves. \nOnce a month, other East Grinstead runners meet up on a Sunday to join him on part of his route, with up to 80 people participating.\nJim Dorrington, chairman of East Grinstead Runners, said: \"To repeat a marathon day after day, I can't get my head around it!\n\"It is impressive the fact he keeps doing it and he is still getting so much enjoyment out of it.\"\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "There\u2019s an issue dividing K-pop fans right now - artificial intelligence.\nSeveral of the genre\u2019s biggest stars have now experimented with the technology to create music videos and produce songs, including boy band Seventeen.\nLast year the South Korean group sold around 16 million albums, making them one of the most successful K-pop acts in history. But it\u2019s their most recent album and single, Maestro, that\u2019s got people talking.\nThe music video features an AI-generated scene, and at the launch of the album in Seoul, one of the band members, Woozi, told reporters he was \"experimenting\" with AI when making music.\n\u201cWe practised making songs with AI, as we want to develop along with technology rather than complain about it,\" he said.\n\"This is a technological development that we have to leverage, not just be dissatisfied with. I practised using AI and tried to look for the pros and cons.\u201d\nHowever, Woozi has since said on Instagram that all of Seventeen's music is \u201cwritten and composed by human creators\u201d.\nOn K-pop discussion pages, fans were torn over the issue of using AI, with some saying more regulations need to be in place before the technology becomes normalised.\nOthers were more open to it, including super fan Ashley Peralta. \"If AI can help an artist overcome creative blocks, then that\u2019s OK with me,\" says the 26-year-old.\nHer worry though, is that a whole album of AI generated lyrics means fans will lose touch with their favourite musicians.\n\"I love it when music is a reflection of an artist and their emotions,\" she says. \"K-pop artists are much more respected when they\u2019re hands on with choreographing, lyric writing and composing, because you get a piece of their thoughts and feelings.\n\"AI can take away that crucial component that connects fans to the artists.\"\nAshley presents Spill the Soju, a K-pop fan podcast, with her best friend Chelsea Toledo. Chelsea admires Seventeen for being a self-producing group, which means they write their own songs and choreograph them too, but she\u2019s worried about AI having an impact on that reputation.\n\u201cIf they were to put out an album that\u2019s full of lyrics they hadn\u2019t personally written, I don\u2019t know if it would feel like Seventeen any more and fans want music that is authentically them\u201d.\nFor those working in K-Pop production, it\u2019s no surprise that artists are embracing new technologies.\nChris Nairn is a producer, composer and songwriter working under the name Azodi. Over the past 12 years he\u2019s written songs for K-pop artists including Kim Woojin and leading agency SM Entertainment.\nWorking with K-pop stars means Chris, who lives in Brighton, has spent a lot of time in South Korea, whose music industry he describes as progressive.\n\u201cWhat I've learned by hanging out in Seoul is that Koreans are big on innovation, and they're very big on \u2018what's the next thing?\u2019, and asking, \u2018how can we be one step ahead?\u2019 It really hit me when I was there,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo, to me, it's no surprise that they're implementing AI in lyric writing, it's about keeping up with technology.\u201d\nIs AI the future of K-pop? Chris isn\u2019t so sure. As someone who experiments with AI lyric generators, he doesn\u2019t feel the lyrics are strong enough for top artists.\n\u201cAI is putting out fairly good quality stuff, but when you're at the top tier of the songwriting game, generally, people who do best have innovated and created something brand new. AI works by taking what\u2019s already been uploaded and therefore can\u2019t innovate by itself.\u201d\nIf anything, Chris predicts AI in K-pop will increase the demand for more personal songs.\n\"There's going to be pressure from fans to hear lyrics that are from the artist's heart, and therefore sound different to any songs made using AI\u201d.\nSeventeen aren\u2019t the only K-pop  band experimenting with AI. Girl group Aespa, who have several AI members as well as human ones, also used the technology in their latest music video. Supernova features generated scenes where the faces of band members remain still as only their mouths move.\nPodcaster and super-fan Chelsea says it \"triggered\" a lot of people.\n\u201cK-pop is known for amazing production and editing, so having whole scenes made of AI takes away the charm,\" she adds.\nChelsea also worries about artists not getting the right credit. \u201cWith AI in videos it\u2019s harder to know if someone\u2019s original artwork has been stolen, it\u2019s a really touchy subject\u201d.\nArpita Adhya is a music journalist and self-titled K-pop superfan. She believes the use of AI in the industry is demonstrative of the pressure artists are under to create new content.\n\u201cMost recording artists will put out an album every two years, but K-pop groups are pushing out albums every six to eight months, because there\u2019s so much hype around them.\u201d\nShe also believes AI has been normalised in the industry, with the introduction of AI covers which have exploded on YouTube. The cover tracks are created by fans and use technology to mimic another artist's voice.\nIt's this kind of trend that Arpita would like",

    "A Dutch sperm donor who fathered hundreds of children has described a new documentary about him as \"misleading\".\nA Netflix docuseries, released on Wednesday, focuses on the women who have had children using the sperm of Jonathan Jacob Meijer. \nOne woman has said she felt \"betrayed, sad and angry\" after finding out how many other children Meijer had fathered.\nBut Meijer told the BBC the documentary is deceptive because it gives prominence to those who are unhappy rather than the many families he says are grateful to him.  \nResponding to the interview, its executive producer described the claim that the majority of families are happy as \"completely untrue\". \nIn the interview, Meijer also said he sees \"absolutely nothing wrong\" with fathering hundreds of children.\nThe 43-year-old declined to be interviewed for the Netflix documentary, but he spoke to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on Wednesday.\n\"They deliberately called [the documentary] The Man With 1,000 Kids, when it should be 'the sperm donor who helped families conceive with 550 children',\" he told the programme.\n\"So already from the start they are deliberately deceiving and misleading.\"\nHe continued: \"I think Netflix did a great job at selecting five families [who are unhappy] out of the 225 families that I've helped, and they [the other families] will definitely tell you something else.\"\nNetflix told Woman's Hour it would not comment on Meijer's interview, but Natalie Hill, the documentary's executive producer, did speak to the programme. \n\"I've spent the last four years speaking to families who have been impacted by Jonathan's lies. I've personally spoken to 45 or 50 families,\" she said. \n\"Fifty families made impact statements to the court about his lies, and pleaded with the judge that he stop. So this continued platform for Jonathan to talk about it being a handful of women is completely untrue.\"\nMeijer has been a donor for 17 years. In many cases, he made donations privately, which meant dealing with the families directly rather than via a private clinic.\nSome women who chose him as a donor say he did not make clear to them the extent of how many other children he had fathered. \n\"I'm conflicted because he told me back then that he was donating to five families,\" one mother, Natalie, told Woman's Hour. \n\"It turned out in 2021 I read an article in a newspaper that it was hundreds of families. That's why I'm conflicted and don't agree with his methods.\"\nSome women he has donated to have described him as \"a narcissist\", while others have suggested he represents a public health risk.\nAsked if he thought his estimate of 550 children was a lot, Meijer said: \"It is for a normal man, but not for a sperm donor. \n\"For a sperm donor it's quite common. They go up into the hundreds of children. They [the clinics] will ship the donor semen to multiple countries.\"\nThe docuseries received extensive coverage ahead of its launch.\nIn a four-star review, the Evening Standard's Vicky Jessup described it as \"a story to chill the blood: a cautionary tale about the perils of the modern age\".\n\"It\u2019s undoubtedly fascinating viewing, albeit in a very grim way \u2013 and the revelations about sperm donation (and Meijer's way of doing it) horrifying,\" she said.\nThe Telegraph's Anita Singh said: \"The film-makers try too hard to turn this into a Tinder Swindler-style tale of women exacting revenge, and there is a late twist. But even without that it\u2019s a decent tale that prompts bigger questions about the donor industry.\"\nSome women have expressed concerns that their child may unknowingly meet and get into a relationship with a half-sibling in the future.\nMother Natalie said: \"The biggest concern is that these children are going to run into one another, and fall in love with one another, because they recognise something in each other and they're not aware of the fact that they're from the same donor dad. \n\"That's the biggest risk I see, because he talks about being an open and known donor, but he has donated to numerous clinics around the globe, and not all the clinics share the same values about being open and honest towards children.\"\nMeijer pushed back on this suggestion, telling presenter Nuala McGovern the concern was based on cases where anonymous donors had been used, whereas his identity was easily available.\n\"I can guarantee you that, now there are cheap DNA tests, and I am on the DNA database, so they can find out,\" he said.\n\"Also, the parents will tell their children they are from a donor. So because they all know my identity, even if the chance happens that they would meet each other, they can simply ask, 'Are you a donor child?', and secondly, 'Is your donor father Jonathan?'\n\"These outdated views, we should stop projecting them on these children. They are very aware they are a donor child. They know how to respond.\"\nMeijer was banned from donating sperm in the Netherlands in 2017 after it emerged he was the father of 102 children, born from donations made to 11 clinics around t",

    "Tearful cheers erupted in a packed Canadian court on Thursday as a serial killer was found guilty of murdering four indigenous women. \nBut in the court gallery, Jeremy Contois' reaction was reserved.\nHis younger sister, Rebecca, was one of the women murdered in Winnipeg, Manitoba two years ago.\n\u201cI feel a little sense of relief,\u201d Mr Contois said, but added that she would not get full closure until the killer, Jeremy Skibicki, is formally sentenced.\nManitoba Court of King's Bench Chief Justice Glenn Joyal dismissed the defence's claim that the accused was schizophrenic and not criminally responsible.\nProsecutors argued that Skibicki, 37, killed Ms Contois and three other women in 2022 in calculated and racially motivated crimes.\nWarning: This story contains details readers may find distressing.\nThe murders and subsequent trial sent shockwaves through Canada\u2019s indigenous community, which has long grappled with cases of violence against their women.\nWearing a grey T-shirt and trousers, Skibicki did not react as Judge Joyal read the the summary of his judgement.\nOne of Ms Contois\u2019 family members held up a large photo of Rebecca in his direction as he left the court. \n\u201cWhy did I lift up her photo? Because we, as First Nations people, are not statistics,\u201d Krista Fox said afterwards.\n\u201cEvery single one of us has a name, and a family that misses us dearly.\u201d\nSkibicki's victims are Morgan Harris, 39, Marcedes Myran, 26 and Ms Contois, who was 24. The fourth woman has yet to be identified, and has been given the name Mashkode Bizhiki\u2019ikwe, meaning Buffalo Woman, by indigenous elders.\nThroughout the trial, a buffalo head sat on a red cloth on a table near the prosecutors in tribute to the still unidentified victim. \nJudge Joyal dismissed the evidence of a British psychiatrist, Dr Sohom Das, who said Skibicki was delusional when he committed the murders.\nThe judge added that the \"mercilessly graphic\" facts of the case \"are largely uncontested\", given that the accused had admitted to the murders to police and in court before the trial. \nSkibicki had pleaded not guilty due to a mental disorder.\nThe 100-person courtroom was packed with the four women's families and friends for the verdict.\nJudge Joyal said the case has had an \"undeniable and profound impact on the entire Manitoba community, indigenous and non-indigenous\".\nWith Skibicki facing life behind bars, the focus is now shifting to finding the remains of two of his victims, Ms Myran and Ms Harris, which are believed to be in a Winnipeg landfill.\nA formal search has been set for this autumn, after months of pressure from their families. \nAccording to court documents, Skibicki killed the women between March and May of 2022, with Ms Contois believed to be the final victim.\nHe met at least two at local homeless shelters in Winnipeg, a city of 820,000 in the prairie province.\nJudge Joyal agreed with prosecutors that he deliberately targeted and exploited \u201cvulnerable\u201d women.\nOver the course of the trial, the court heard that Skibicki had assaulted the women, strangled or drowned them and then committed sex acts on them before dismembering their bodies and disposing of them in rubbish bins.\nThe killings went undetected for months, until a man looking for scrap metal in a bin outside Skibicki\u2019s apartment found partial human remains in May 2022 and called police.\n\u201cShe\u2019s obviously been murdered,\u201d the man said in the 911 call, which was played in court.\nPolice were able to identify the remains as those of Ms Contois.\nMore of her remains were discovered at a city-run landfill the following month.\nIn police interviews shortly after his arrest, Skibicki surprised officers by admitting to killing Ms Contois as well as three others.\nAt that point, police had no knowledge of the other deaths.\nSpeaking outside court, Ms Fox said she believes that it was only because Ms Contois\u2019 remains were found that the other families were able to get justice.\nSkibicki\u2019s lawyers tried to argue that he was not aware of the severity of his actions due to delusions driven by schizophrenia. They argued he was hearing voices that told him to commit the crimes as part of a mission from god.\nProsecutors argued that Skibicki was fully aware of his actions, saying they were \u201cintentional, purposeful and racially motivated\u201d.\nThey demonstrated this through a mix of DNA forensic evidence, surveillance footage showing Skibicki with the women in their final days, as well as testimony from his ex-wife, who detailed a history of physical abuse.\nHad Skibicki been found not criminally responsible for the four murders, it would have been a relative rarity in Canadian law.\nAccording to data from Canada's statistics agency and reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper, between 2000 and 2022, of 8,883,749 criminal cases prosecuted across the country, only 5,178 \u2013 or 0.06% \u2013 had such verdicts.\nThe case unearthed deep wounds for Canada\u2019s indigenous community, which has long grappled with a high number of cases of their women ",
    "The government has announced emergency measures to deal with prison overcrowding in England and Wales.\nThese include early release for some prisoners when they have served 40% of their sentence.\nThe first people are likely to be released under the scheme in September.\nPrisoners who are in jail for serious violent offences with sentences of four years or more, as well as sex offenders, will not be released early under this scheme. \nIt will also exclude those convicted of domestic abuse and what the government calls \"connected crimes\", such as stalking offences and controlling or coercive behaviours.\nIt only applies to a certain type of prison sentence, under which prisoners are automatically released after a set amount of time.\nMore serious offenders serving life sentences, for example, are only released after the Parole Board has assessed whether they still pose a risk.\nSources say it will most likely amount to a number in the low thousands leaving prison early. \nAnyone released will be monitored by the Probation Service and this could involve the use of electronic tagging and curfews. \nMinistry of Justice data shows the total England and Wales prison population on 12 July was 87,505, close to the record high of 88,000 in 2011.\nAnd the \"usable operational capacity\" - the total number of people a prison can hold while taking into account issues like control and security - was 88,956, leaving spare capacity of just 1,451 places.\nThis is well above the prison service\u2019s own measure of a \"good, decent standard of accommodation\", which at the end of June was 79,698.\nAt current rates, the prison population is projected to rise by about 19,000 by 2028, while capacity is set to rise by 9,000.\nThe early release of inmates, to ease pressure on prisons, also happened under the Conservatives and under the last Labour government.\nPrisons in Scotland have also had to release people early to ease overcrowding. There were just over 8,000 people in prison in Scotland last week.\nLast year, prisons in Northern Ireland had an average daily population of 1,685, a figure which has risen in recent years.\nThis picture is why prison governors wrote to party leaders during the election campaign, to warn: \u201cWithin a matter of days prisons across the UK will be full\u201d and that this would put the public at risk.\nThe governors argued that this was because the courts would soon have nowhere to place serious offenders.\nIn 2018 - the latest year for which comparable data is available - England and Wales had 150 prisoners per 100,000 people, the highest proportion in Western Europe.\nSpain (138 per 100,000) and Portugal (126 per 100,000) were the two western European countries with the next highest rates of imprisonment.\nThe Institute for Government think tank says part of the answer is longer sentences.\nIn 2023, the average prison sentence given in the Crown Courts in England and Wales, which deal with more serious offences, was more than 25% longer than in 2012.\nFor some crimes, the increase has been even greater. Sentences for robbery, for example, were 13 months longer on average in 2023 than in 2012, a rise of 36%.\nLonger sentences mean more people in prison at any given time.\nAnother part of the answer is the increase in prisoners on remand, who are waiting for their trial to start, or to be sentenced.\nIn March this year the remand prison population stood at 16,458, a record high. In 2016, it was about 10,000. \nSome of this increase has been driven by a record number of Crown Court cases waiting to be heard.\nMore people than before are also being returned to prison for breaching their release conditions.\nIn March, the number was around 12,000 - another record high - and roughly double the number in 2016.\nIn its 2021 Spending Review the then Conservative government said it would build an extra 20,000 prison places in England and Wales \"by the mid-2020s\".\nBut only about 6,000 have been built.\nThe chief civil servant in the Ministry of Justice wrote in July last year that only \u00a31.1bn of the \u00a34bn committed to this prison building programme had been spent.\nOne of the obstacles has been the planning system and local objections to new prisons, including from some Conservative MPs.\nThe Labour government says it wants to continue building the remaining prison places but has not said when they  will be completed.\nThe Ministry of Justice estimates that the average direct cost of funding each prison place in England and Wales in 2022-23 was \u00a351,108.\nThere are signs Labour will take a different approach to prisons.\nBefore he was appointed the new prisons minister, James Timpson, in a Channel 4 interview, stressed the need to break the cycle of re-offending by giving ex-offenders more job opportunities, something he has done through his family firm Timpson.\nThe key cutting and shoe-repair company says around a tenth of its employees are former prisoners.\nMr Timpson also spoke about reducing sentencing and sending considerably fewer people to prison tha",

    "The introduction of a temporary timetable by ScotRail highlights a big long-term problem - it simply does not have enough drivers.\nTo keep the full timetable running, it relies on drivers agreeing to do overtime and work on rest days.\nThis working is entirely voluntary.\nIn recent days fewer drivers than normal have been available to do overtime amid an escalating row over pay. \nThat led to ScotRail cutting about 600 services in a bid to preserve the \u201ccertainty and reliability\u201d of its services.\nIt is important to note the rail unions are not taking industrial action, even though the practical effect of the decisions many drivers have taken is similar to that of an official overtime ban.\nScotRail is not alone \u2013 most rail companies in the UK are also reliant on overtime from drivers to fulfil their timetables. And recent years have seen disputes at many operators.\nThe last pay dispute at ScotRail was two years ago - shortly after the train company was brought back into public ownership by the Scottish government.\nThe company agreed to recruit and train more new drivers to reduce its reliance on overtime but this takes time.\nNew drivers take part in a training programme which lasts between 18 and 24 months.\nBringing ScotRail into public ownership also means that the buck now stops with the Scottish government if things go wrong.\nIt also means that ScotRail has to work within the Scottish government's pay policy.\nThe current pay offer - rejected by the unions last week - is a three-year deal running from this April until 2027.\nIt would see staff get a 2% rise each April then a 1% rise the following January.\nIf ScotRail were to want to make an offer which broke the Scottish government's pay policy, it would need to get approval at a senior government level.\nThe drivers' union Aslef is set to decide next week whether to hold a ballot on actual industrial action at ScotRail.\nThe union will be all too aware of how drivers themselves have managed to cause a huge level of disruption already.\nRealistically the earliest dates for any official action by the union would be in the latter half of August.\nThen the Scottish government could be facing two significant public sector pay disputes.\nIt currently looks likely that council refuse workers will go on strike in mid-August in many parts of the country, including Edinburgh.\nThe nightmare scenario would be images of the rubbish piling up in Edinburgh during the festival while train services across Scotland are at a standstill.\nPrevious council pay disputes have only been settled after the Scottish government provided councils with extra money to help.\nTeachers' unions are also deeply unhappy with this year's pay offer. Staff were due to get a rise in August.\nIf there is no progress early in the new term towards what the unions would see as an acceptable pay offer, it is likely that they will start to move in the direction of industrial action.\nThe thought of three significant public sector pay disputes which cause widespread inconvenience to the public would be something of a doomsday scenario for government ministers.\nBut time is running out to avoid this.",
    "Long before ChatGPT came along, governments were keen to use chatbots to automate their services and advice.\nThose early chatbots \"tended to be simpler, with limited conversational abilities,\" says Colin van Noordt, a researcher on the use of AI in government, and based in the Netherlands.\nBut the emergence of generative AI in the last two years, has revived a vision of more efficient public service, where human-like advisors can work all hours, replying to questions over benefits, taxes and other areas where the government interacts with the public.\nGenerative AI is sophisticated enough to give human-like responses, and if trained on enough quality data, in theory it could deal with all sorts of questions about government services.\nBut generative AI has become well known for making mistakes or even nonsensical answers - so-called hallucinations.\nIn the UK, the Government Digital Service (GDS) has carried out tests on a ChatGPT-based chatbot called GOV.UK Chat, which would answer citizens' questions on a range of issues concerning government services.\nIn a blog post about their early findings, the agency noted that almost 70% of those involved in the trial found the responses useful.\nHowever, there were problems with \"a few\" cases of the system generating incorrect information and presenting it as fact.\nThe blog also raised concern that there might be misplaced confidence in a system that could be wrong some of the time.\n\u201cOverall, answers did not reach the highest level of accuracy demanded for a site like GOV.UK, where factual accuracy is crucial. We\u2019re rapidly iterating this experiment to address the issues of accuracy and reliability.\"\nOther countries are also experimenting with systems based on generative AI.\nPortugal released the Justice Practical Guide in 2023, a chatbot devised to answer basic questions on simple subjects such as marriage and divorce. The chatbot has been developed with funds from the European Union\u2019s Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).\nThe \u20ac1.3m ($1.4m; \u00a31.1m) project is based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT 4.0 language model. As well as covering marriage and divorce, it also provides information on setting-up a company.\nAccording to data by the Portuguese Ministry of Justice, 28,608 questions were posed through the guide in the project\u2019s first 14 months.\nWhen I asked it the basic question: \"How can I set up a company,\" it performed well.\nBut when I asked something trickier: \"Can I set up a company if I am younger than 18, but married?\", it apologised for not having the information to answer that question.\nA ministry source admits that they are still lacking in terms of trustworthiness, even though wrong replies are rare.\n\u201cWe hope these limitations will be overcome with a decisive increase in the answers\u2019 level of confidence\u201d, the source tells me.\nSuch flaws mean that many experts are advising caution \u2013 including Colin van Noordt. \u201cIt goes wrong when the chatbot is deployed as a way to replace people and reduce costs.\"\nIt would be a more sensible approach, he adds, if they're seen as \"an additional service, a quick way to find information\u201d.\nSven Nyholm, professor of the ethics of artificial intelligence at Munich\u2019s Ludwig Maximilians University, highlights the problem of accountability.\n\u201cA chatbot is not interchangeable with a civil servant,\" he says. \"A human being can be accountable and morally responsible for their actions.\n\"AI chatbots cannot be accountable for what they do. Public administration requires accountability, and so therefore it requires human beings.\u201d\nMr Nyholm also highlights the problem of reliability.\n\"Newer types of chatbots create the illusion of being intelligent and creative in a way that older types of chatbots didn't used to do.\n\"Every now and then these new and more impressive forms of chatbots make silly and stupid mistakes - this  can sometimes be humorous, but it can potentially also be dangerous, if people rely on their recommendations.\"\nIf ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) are not ready to give out important advice, then perhaps we could look at Estonia for an alternative.\nWhen it comes to digitising public services, Estonia has been one of the leaders. Since the early 1990s it has been building digital services, and in 2002 introduced a digital ID card that allows citizens to access state services.\nSo it's not surprising that Estonia is at the forefront of introducing chatbots.\nThe nation is currently developing a suite of chatbots for state services under the name of B\u00fcrokratt.\nHowever, Estonia's chatbots are not based on Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini.\nInstead they use Natural Language Processing (NLP), a technology which preceded the latest wave of AI.\nEstonia's NLP algorithms break down a request into small segments, identify key words, and from that infers what user wants.\nAt B\u00fcrokratt, departments use their data to train chatbots and check their answers.\n\u201cIf B\u00fcrokratt does not know the answer, the chat will be han",
    "Comedian David Baddiel said an Oxford school's rewrite of the iconic song Three Lions was \"so brilliant and so moving\".\nSt Nicolas CE Primary School in Abingdon have been getting ready for Sunday's Euros final between England and Spain. \nHeadteacher, Mr Spooner, rewrote the lyrics to the song, originally produced and performed by Mr Baddiel, Frank Skinner and The Lightning Seeds in 1996. \nWhile speaking to BBC Radio Oxford, Mr Spooner and his students Emily and James found out what Mr Baddiel thought of their version.\nIn a video recording from the comedian, who co-wrote the original song, he joked Mr Spooner \"did not have legal permission\" to change the lyrics and he's considered \"coming into the school and having him arrested\". \nBut he added: \"Your version of it was so brilliant and so moving, you did it so well. \n\"I've decided to let him off so well done for that and let's all hope football is coming home.\"\nReacting to the clip, 11-year-old pupils James and Emily said it was \"awesome\" he'd heard the song. \nMr Spooner's rewrite included lyrics like: \"Germany hosts, it\u2019s been three years. A win, two draws, we\u2019re top of the group, but it starts, all the fears and critics who have been there before say the team\u2019s such a bore.\" \nHe recorded 60 of his year 6 pupils singing the song during an assembly and said they didn't have much time to rehearse. \nThe video of their performance has since been uploaded to social media. \nMr Spooner told Radio Oxford host, Adam Ball: \"Obviously all of the children have been very excited over the last few weeks and I'm a rather large football fan myself.\n\"I wanted to bring a bit of festive cheer and fun and share it with the world just to enjoy this special occasion.\"\nMore of his rewritten lyrics include: \"But then we see Jude\u2019s bicycle kick, and those penalty kicks, Ollies goal last minute, the nation\u2019s screaming.\" \nMr Spooner added: \"It's just reflecting the tournament and we talk to the children a lot about navigating hard times, but ultimately it can lead to amazing success.\n\"Some of the comments [on the video] have been really overwhelming and put, hopefully, a smile on people's faces.

    "Sabrina Cohen-Hatton has gone from rough sleeping as a teenager to visiting the Prince of Wales in Windsor Castle to give him advice on tackling homelessness.\nShe was able to give her own story to Prince William as proof that homeless people should not be \"written off\".\n\"I sit in front of you now with a job, a home, a family and a PhD,\" said Sabrina, who works as a fire service chief.\nPrince William marked the first year of his Homewards project with a visit to Lambeth in south London where he pleged: \"It is possible to end homelessness.\"\nThe prince delivered the message that there is nothing inevitable about homelessness and that it shouldn't be normalised.\nMeeting Homewards representatives in Brixton he said: \u201cHomelessness is a complex societal issue, and one that touches the lives of far too many people in our society. However, I truly believe that it can be ended.\"\nHe spoke of the importance of \"shifting perspectives\" about homeless people and the need to \"focus on prevention, rather than simply managing the crisis\".\nHomewards is a five-year project based around six areas around the UK.\nThat includes Newport in South Wales - and as a 15- and 16-year-old that was where Sabrina was sleeping rough, after the death of a parent and problems at home.\nHer way out was selling the Big Issue - \"I credit them with saving my life\" - and once she had secure accommodation she was able to get a job in the fire service, which became her career.\nShe used this \"lived experience\"  to tell Prince William and the Homewards project about what was needed.\n\"There were lots of closed doors in my face,\" she said. Even when support was meant to be available, she said in practice it could be hard for homeless people to have the confidence to access it.\nOr there can be practical barriers. She said she relied on her dog, called Menace, but many hostels wouldn't let people stay with pets.\nSabrina also warned of how homelessness was linked to the \"pernicious\" long-term impact of poverty.\nShe went on to become chief fire officer of West Sussex and has spoken widely about her own journey, including this latest role as an advocate for Homewards.\nSabrina said Prince William showed a lot of \"empathy\" towards the issue of homelessness, which she suggested reflected some of the \"trauma\" in his early life.\nAt the event in Brixton, Sabrina spoke alongside Chris Lynam, who recalled the intense \"loneliness\" that accompanied his own homelessness and drug addiction.\n\"It's a very isolating experience... society is quite hostile to homeless people,\" said Chris, who is now supporting Homewards' work in Sheffield.\nPrince William described it as an \"honour\" to hear Chris talk about his experiences.\nThe homelessness project, operating in Aberdeen, Bournemouth, Lambeth, Newport, Sheffield and Northern Ireland, wants to find successful approaches that can be replicated elsewhere.\nThere are links with employers about helping people into work. A partnership with Homebase provides starter packs of furniture to help those moving from homelessness into accommodation.\nThere are efforts to identify sofa-surfing and addressing links between relationship breakdown and homelessness.\nPutting housing officers in schools has been tried to identify young people who might be at risk.\nThrough the Duchy of Cornwall there are 24 homes being built with \"wrap-around support\" for people leaving homelessness - and Prince William is now involved in developing further plans.\nThere is a push to change attitudes towards homelessness - and Sabrina talked about the need to get rid of the stigma. She said that for 20 years she hadn't told anyone about her own experiences, before becoming such a public speaker about homelessness.\nMatt Downie, chief executive of Crisis, says the Homewards project can challenge the \"cynicism and fatalism\" that says homelessness is inevitable.\nHe says that even though the big picture has seen homelessness getting worse, the evidence exists to prevent it.\nFinland is given as an example of a sustained drive to end homelessness, with the claim that there are now only about 150 homeless families. In contrast in the UK, there are more than 100,000 households categorised as homeless.\nThere have also been questions about whether a wealthy royal should be pronouncing on homelessness.\nThe anti-monarchy group Republic has previously described it as \"crass and hypocritical\".\nBut George Anderson, a Big Issue seller and medical researcher in London, welcomes that Prince William has used his high public profile to talk about homelessness.\n\"He encourages people who are distant from homelessness to feel empathy and care,\" says George.\n\"Given the pomp and ceremony around his official role, it is easy for people to question as to what he really knows about homelessness,\" says George.\n\"I am sure that he is aware of that whilst also knowing he is in a position, like his mother, to highlight the plight of homelessness to the media.\n\"His mother would have experienced similar,",
    "A four-year-old boy was taken to the opticians when his eye started to flicker - only for his parents to be told he had developed a brain tumour.\nRome Hill's family said they had no idea he was blind in his problem right eye because he didn't show any signs of having problems with his sight. \nThe little boy a six-hour-long operation on 20 June where he had part of the tumour removed.\n\"We couldn't believe it. You always hear about it on the news or on TV - but you never think it would be your family,\" said Rome's dad, Perry Hill, 33, from Cardiff.\nHe said he took his son to the opticians after he and his partner Katie Hayes, 30, noticed Rome's eye started to flicker involuntarily in April.\n\"I was looking at his eye while he was watching TV and I noticed it flicker up and down,\" Mr Hill said.\n\"I mentioned it to Katie and we first thought it was an involuntary thing. But we decided to get it checked out.\"\nThe couple took Rome to the optician's where they were told that he had \"quite low vision\". \nIt was only when a consultant spoke to the family that they found out that Rome was blind in his right eye.\n\"We couldn't believe it. Rome has never shown any indication that he had issues with his eyesight,\" Mr Hill said.\n\"He has no issues with balance or coordination. I play rugby and when I'm on the pitch waving at him, he can see me and waves back.\"\nRome was sent for a MRI scan and a few weeks later, the family were called into an appointment with the consultant. \n\"We were taken into this room with comfy chairs and we then wondered 'what are they going to tell us?' We were really anxious,\" his dad said.\nThe consultant told the couple that Rome had a brain tumour sitting on a fluid pocket close to a gland at the base of his brain.\nRome's six-hour-long surgery saw part of the tumour removed due to where it was positioned. \n\"On the day of the operation, I paced the whole house. It was agonising. When he came out of theatre and we were told the operation was a success, it was such as relief,\" Mr Hill said.\n\"The main thing that we wanted was to get our boy back home. He has been so brave throughout everything he has gone through,\" he added. \nThe family were told that the tumour was called a low-grade glioma and was non-cancerous. Rome will now undergo chemotherapy to shrink the remaining part of the tumour. \nHe will also have tests to determine whether the shrinking of the tumour will mean that the vision in his right eye improves over time.\nMr Hill said: \"We were over the moon to find out it was benign. It has all gone in so quick and everything is still so raw. \n\"But we wanted to raise awareness of our story and the great work that the team in Noah's Ark do.\"\nMr Hill has now set up a fundraising page and challenged himself to run 10k to raise money for Noah's Ark.\n\"It's a 10k for 10k.

    "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has set out the first steps towards setting up a UK Border Security Command, which the government hopes will reduce small boat crossings in the English Channel.\nWork to recruit an \"exceptional leader\" to head the body will begin on Monday, with the government preparing a bill to create counter-terror powers aimed at tackling organised immigration crime.\nThe Home Office says the command leader - expected to be appointed within weeks - would draw together work of intelligence agencies, police, Immigration Enforcement and Border Force.\nThe measures are Labour's alternative to the Conservatives' plan to deter small boat crossings by sending some arrivals to Rwanda.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer confirmed on Saturday the scheme would be scrapped  when he called it \"dead and buried\". \nThroughout the election campaign, his party promised to divert \u00a375m from the Rwanda policy to set up the Border Security Command.\nThe Conservatives dismissed the proposal, with then-Home Secretary James Cleverly telling the BBC Labour's border command would do exactly what the government's small boats operation was already doing. \nHe said by scrapping the Rwanda scheme Labour were \"going to do less and somehow hope to achieve more\". \"That\u2019s not credible,\" Mr Cleverly added. \nKevin Saunders, a former chief immigration officer for Border Force, also expressed concern about the government scrapping the Rwanda plan. \nHe told Times Radio the scheme had caused \"unease in the camps in northern France\". \"They were very, very worried. And we saw people fleeing to the Republic of Ireland because they didn't want to be included in it,\" he said.\nMs Cooper said Labour would \"tackle the root of the problem\" by targeting the criminal smuggling gangs \"making millions out of small boat crossings, undermining our border security and putting lives at risk\".\nShe told broadcasters the recruitment of a new border security commander as well as new cross-border police represented a \"major upgrade in law enforcement\". \nAsked when small boat crossings would start going down, Ms Cooper repeatedly avoided giving any specific date, saying instead she wanted to make progress \"as rapidly as possible\". \nIn addition to beginning recruitment for someone to lead the command, the home secretary said she would be commissioning an investigation into the routes, methods and tactics used by people smuggling gangs to help inform her approach. \nFormer Labour Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair had argued that introducing digital ID cards would help control immigration but Ms Cooper said that would not be her approach. \nPressed on whether she would be asking Rwanda to repay money it had been given to accept people from the UK, Ms Cooper said she would be \"auditing\" the details and setting out next steps to Parliament. \nThe number of immigrants and asylum seekers trying to come to the UK by crossing the English Channel in small boats has been increasing rapidly since 2018. \nIn 2023, more than 29,000 people made the dangerous journey. As of 26 June, 13,195 people had come to the UK via small boat crossing in the Channel in 2024 - above the numbers for the same period in the previous four years.\nThe numbers coming to the UK illegally are smaller than legal migration figures. \nLast year, net migration - the number of people coming to the UK minus the number leaving - was 685,000. That represented a fall of 10% on the previous year. ",
    "On Saturday afternoon, US Vice-President Kamala Harris sat on stage at a black cultural festival in New Orleans, talking about her life story and what she felt she had achieved in the White House.\nIt was the kind of event that the first female, black and South Asian American vice-president has regularly attended throughout her three-and-a-half years as Joe Biden\u2019s deputy, usually trailed by a small press pack dwarfed by that which follows the president himself.\nBut as panicked Democrats a thousand miles away in Washington weighed replacing 81-year-old Joe Biden as the party\u2019s candidate for November\u2019s election following his woeful and sometimes incomprehensible debate performance against Donald Trump, the number of reporters trailing Ms Harris had swelled to dozens.\nOn stage and through her travels this weekend, the vice-president did not address swirling questions about Mr Biden\u2019s fitness for office and whether he should withdraw and hand the baton to her.\nBut in discussing ambition and how to forge your own path with her audience in New Orleans, she encouraged the crowd not to listen to naysayers.\n\u201cPeople in your life will tell you, though, it\u2019s not your time. It\u2019s not your turn. Nobody like you has done it before,\" she said. \"Don\u2019t you ever listen to that.\"\nSince the disastrous CNN debate on 27 June, she has repeatedly defended her boss, arguing that his record as president shouldn\u2019t be outweighed by 90 minutes on a debate stage. Mr Biden himself has struck a defiant tone and fiercely insisted that he will remain the nominee.\nYet as calls grow louder for the president to step aside, some high-profile Democrats are unifying behind 59-year-old Ms Harris as the natural candidate to replace him.\nOn Sunday, congressman Adam Schiff of California told NBC's Meet The Press that either Mr Biden had to be able to \u201cwin overwhelmingly or he has to pass the torch to someone who can\u201d. Kamala Harris, he added, could \u201cvery well win overwhelmingly\u201d against Trump.\nThat\u2019s a proposition that has raised eyebrows among some Democrats, including Biden allies, who see in Ms Harris a vice-president who failed in her bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination before the first ballot was even cast and who has struggled with an uneven record and low approval ratings throughout her time in the White House.\nAgainst that, senior Democratic lawmakers like Mr Schiff and South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn have been floating Ms Harris as the obvious successor should Mr Biden ultimately bow to party pressure.\nSupporters point to a handful of polls that suggest she would perform better than the president in a hypothetical match-up against Donald Trump, and they argue she has the national profile, campaign infrastructure and appeal to younger voters that could make the transition seamless four months before election day.\nAn elevation to the top of the ticket would be a remarkable turnaround for a woman not long ago seen as a political weakness by senior figures in the Biden White House. Even Mr Biden himself reportedly described her as a \u201cwork in progress\" during their first months in office.\nBut Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic strategist and Harris\u2019s former communications director, said she had long been underestimated.\n\u201cWhether she\u2019s a partner to the president or she has to lead the ticket, she is somebody who Republicans and the Trump campaign need to take seriously,\u201d Mr Simmons told the BBC.\nSince the debate and its fall-out, Ms Harris has altered her schedule to stick close to the president. She appeared at a heavily-scrutinised meeting last Wednesday where Mr Biden sought to reassure powerful Democratic governors about his fitness for office.\nAnd a day later, on the Fourth of July - America\u2019s Independence Day - she abandoned her usual tradition of grilling hotdogs for firefighters and Secret Service agents at her Los Angeles home to be by Mr Biden\u2019s side at the White House celebrations.\nThe former top prosecutor has focused on criticising Trump in public appearances since the debate, pressing the case as to why voters should believe he is a threat to democracy and women\u2019s rights. At the same time, she has offered nothing but steadfast support for Mr Biden.\nVice-presidents always need to strike a delicate balancing act between ambition and loyalty, but Ms Harris knows that this is not a moment where she can show any daylight between her and the president.\nKamala Harris is, however, far from the only alternative to Mr Biden being discussed. The list of potential Biden replacements ranges from a cadre of popular governors - Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro and Illinois\u2019 JB Pritzker - to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and California congressman Ro Khanna.\nMs Harris and her staff have refused to engage in public speculation.

And where can you see them? \nBonfires are lit in some unionist areas on 11 July to kick off the Twelfth celebrations.\nThe date commemorates the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 when the Protestant King William III - also known as King Billy and William of Orange - defeated Catholic King James II.\nBonfires were lit to welcome - and guide - William.\nHistorically, a much smaller number of bonfires were lit in mainly nationalist areas on 15 August to mark the Catholic feast of the Assumption, a tradition that was replaced in some places by bonfires to mark the anniversary of the introduction of internment - or detention without trial - on 9 August 1971.\nMost bonfires are lit at about midnight heading into 12 July. \nHowever, some are lit as early as 21:00 BST on 11 July and as late as 02:30 BST on 12 July. \nThe earlier times are to allow more members of the community to attend and limit the noise and disturbance in the early hours of the morning. \nSmaller children's bonfires and events, which often include bouncy castles, local bands, games and music, run earlier in the day near most bonfires.\nWhile there no specific laws aimed directly at bonfires, legislation about things such as the environment, pollution, blocking roads and fly-tipping do apply.\nLocal authorities, the Department for Infrastructure, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) and the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) all have different powers they can use to regulate bonfires.\nCouncils can also take action under a number of different pieces of legislation, including penalties for littering. \nSome people object to loyalist bonfires being used as a form of cultural expression, particularly when they involve the burning of flags, effigies and election posters.\nIn 2022, the Reverend Mervyn Gibson, the grand secretary of the Orange Order, condemned the burning of effigies on bonfires.\nLast year, Sinn F\u00e9in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill told people using effigies on bonfires to \"catch themselves on\".\nIn 2023, 11 paramedics were attacked on the night of 11 July and early hours of 12 July. \nThe assaults occurred at four locations , three of them bonfire sites, with the most serious incident at one bonfire in Carrickfergus involving five paramedics. \nThe bonfires can raise tensions if they are located close to nationalist areas.\nThere is also the issue of safety if bonfires are close to people and properties, as well as their environmental impact.\nThe largest bonfire in recent years has been in the Craigyhill estate in Larne, with its height in 2023 reported to be about 210ft (64m).\nTraditionally bonfires were much smaller but there were a lot more of them.\nThey were largely built on street corners or waste ground in loyalist areas.\nBut in recent years, communities have joined together to consolidate their resources to form much larger bonfires, often due to a lack of space.\nFor some bonfires, the increased size is due to friendly rivalry between communities in a race to build the biggest bonfire. \nBonfires are largely constructed from wooden pallets and household waste but old tyres are sometimes placed in the pyre, and these release toxic fumes when burned.\nMore eco-friendly beacons have been appearing around Northern Ireland in the last few years.\nThese are smaller, pyramid-shaped steel structures, which are pre-filled with a carbon neutral willow wood. They stand on a bed of sand to avoid damage to roads and surfaces, and are designed to be reusable.\nNot everyone is a fan of them, though.\nWhile beacons are arguably safer and environmentally friendlier, collecting materials for the bonfire and helping build it has been a long-standing and proud tradition among many families and communities.\nIn the building and lighting of bonfires, safety has been an issue. \nIn 2023, The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) attended 34 bonfire-related incidents and said \"no bonfire is totally safe\". \nIn 2022, John Steele died after falling off a bonfire he was helping to build.\nMid and East Antrim Borough Council is facing legal action over the death and plans to engage with the community to improve safety.\nBonfire builders in Larne have said they applied numerous safety procedures before allowing a parachute jump from their bonfire on Monday night.\nCommunities collect for bonfires months in advance - both financially and physically.\nMost fundraise for local charities or causes and organise family fun days in the run-up to the bonfire being lit.\nWhile a number are self-funded, some avail of council and government funding through cultural expression grants.\nThey come with stipulations such as not displaying paramilitary symbols or burning flags, effigies or tyres.",
    "Voters in Mid Norfolk are feeling disillusioned ahead of the general election as they face growing costs of living, candidates claim.\nThe Green Party, Labour, Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats are hoping to unseat Conservative George Freeman.\nMr Freeman has held the seat since 2010, but says he feels like a change could be coming.\nHere are the candidates, listed in alphabetical order according to last name.\nMr Freeman, 56, has served in the last three governments, most recently as minister of state for science, technology and innovation.\nHe is campaigning on issues such as the rural cost of living and high energy prices, calling for fairer funding for rural areas.\nBut he acknowledges voters are disillusioned with politics on the doorsteps.\n\"It's tough,\u201d he said. \"Everyone is paying more for less.\n\"I suspect we will end up with a Labour MP because I think a lot of Conservatives are disillusioned and won't vote or they\u2019ll vote Reform.\n\"But I'm not going to gift this seat to anyone. I want to make sure that whoever wins wins because they've had to work really hard and promise people that they will do the job.\"\nCurrently a Green Norwich city councillor, Ash Haynes, 33, is standing for the party in Mid Norfolk.\nShe hopes to tackle issues such as rural transport and a lack of affordable housing in the area.\nMs Haynes said the Greens offered voters hope for the future.\n\"Unfortunately, the government is giving us complete shambles most of the time at the moment,\" she said.\n\"People aren't feeling hugely inspired by what Labour has to offer either, or people voting for them because they feel they should, not because they want to.\n\"So I think if we\u2019re offering hope, we\u2019re offering change and that\u2019s really resonating with people and somebody they can trust, somebody who's actually knocked on the door that they feel they can trust.\"\nA chartered accountant, Stuart Howard, 53, is standing for the Liberal Democrats.\nHe says many voters are struggling with access to NHS services as well as problems with rural infrastructure and transport.\nHe said: \"Listening to people, you can see it's really marginal pounds that impact their daily lives and I don't think we're appreciating that enough when we talk about interest rates.\n\"People don\u2019t relate to that. People relate to have they enough money to buy milk? Have they enough money to buy food? Have they enough money to get on the bus to go to work?\n\"Real, everyday issues that really impact people.\"\nOriginally from Northern Ireland, Mr Kher is a mortgage advisor who moved to Norfolk with his family in 2015.\nHe says a \"rapid growth\" in Norfolk\u2019s population is putting pressure on public services.\nHe claimed the Conservatives \"aren\u2019t being taken seriously\" by voters.\n\"The biggest problem they have is that anything they promise is not taken seriously because they have to run on their record,\" he said.\n\"After 14 years, you've got to run on the record and they\u2019re refusing to run on the record because it's so bad.\n\"But we also want those Labour supporters as well. We've got many working people, traditional Labour voters who are going to be voting for us this time and they can see that what we offer is meaningful change.\"\nA former director of children\u2019s services at Norfolk County Council, Michael Rosen, 65, is standing for Labour.\nHe says he is campaigning on national issues in this election, pledging to invest in public services and boost job security if elected.\nHe said voters were open to a fresh start on the doorsteps.\n!There\u2019s a really interesting mixture of anger and hope,\" he said. \"People start angry and you talk to them about what the plans are and what Labour's offer is and they come round from anger into hope.\n\"It's a really emotionally engaging experience for a candidate to be able to have discussions with people on the doorstep and take them from feeling anger, disillusion, hopelessness and say 'but we could be doing this' and inspiring them.\"\nA full list of candidates can be found here.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The opening scene of the Oscar-winning 1981 film Chariots of Fire is one of the best known and most imitated in movie history.\nShot on the magnificent West Sands at St Andrews, it shows a group of young athletes, all dressed in white, running barefoot along the water's edge as Vangelis's score swells in the background.\nAmong them is Scottish athlete Eric Liddell whose feats at the Paris Olympics exactly 100 years ago have become the stuff of legend. \nWith the latest Olympics just weeks away, and also being held in the French capital, Liddell's legacy is once again being remembered.\nA devout Christian, Liddell famously withdrew from his best event - the 100m - because the heats were held on a Sunday and he considered it to be a day of religious observance. \nFive days later, on Friday 11 July 1924, he ran in the 400m and secured his place in history.\nNot only did he collect gold by a margin of six metres but he also set a world record of 47.6 seconds in the process.\nHe remains the last British man to win Olympic gold in the event.\nEilidh Doyle, who won bronze in the 400m relay at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, said the 400m is not a race that sprinters like to compete in.\n''It's known as one of the hardest events,\" she said.\nDoyle said the training is very different for the two events.\n\"To then go and win and run the fastest time in history, at that moment, was incredible,\" she said.\n''I think it just shows, not only his physical capabilities, but also that mindset to be like, 'this isn't going to be a barrier for me, I'm just going to go and do that'.''\nLiddell was born in China in 1902 to Scots missionary parents.\nHe studied at Edinburgh University and became known as the Flying Scotsman for sprinting prowess.\nAllan Wells, who won Olympic gold at the Men's 100m sprint in Moscow in 1980, said Liddell was inspirational.\nHe said: \"To run what he did on cinder tracks is unbelievable.\n''He had guts and determination.\"\nBefore he won Olympic gold, Liddell also played rugby for Scotland, winning seven caps in the early 1920s.\nWells said: ''When you delve into his Christianity and his missionary work, and the rugby player, I'm certainly in awe of him.\n''I think that you shouldn't forget great athletes, and what they've achieved, but in this instance, this is just a bit more than being an athlete and winning an Olympic gold medal.''\nSoon after his Olympic triumph, Liddell finished his studies and returned to China to become a missionary.\nAs well as religious duties, he worked as a science and sports teacher at the Anglo/Chinese College in Tianjin.\nAfter the Japanese invasion in 1937, Liddell carried on his missionary work even when it became dangerous to do so.\nLiddell's wife and children left China for Canada in 1941 but he stayed to help in any way he could.\nIn 1943 he was interned at Weifang and he died of a brain tumour just months before the end of World War II, at the age of 43.\nChariots of Fire, which won a Best Picture Oscar, brought Liddell back to public attention in the 1980s.\nLiddell's niece Sue Caton says the film shows him to be quite serious but he was less sombre in real life.\n''He wasn't a serious character at all,\" she says.\n''I think he was shown as that in the film but underneath it all he was quite mischievous, because my auntie Flo, who was his wife, told us some nice stories about how he was a joker.\"\nShe said his middle daughter was named Heather after it was chosen by drawing lots.\n\"He put names in a cup and, of course, the name Heather came out.\n\"Because he'd written Heather on all of them.''",
    "A council has revealed a \u00a3900,000 overspend on a project to convert an old Ikea store.\nCoventry City Council confirmed the transformation of the site on Croft Road into a cultural hub was hit by rising costs last year.\nThe report, due to go before the authority\u2019s cabinet on Tuesday, also revealed the council made a \u00a3400,000 loss on a renovation of St Mary\u2019s Guildhall.\nThe authority said the projects were affected by rising costs and the impact of the Covid pandemic.\nA council spokesperson said the Ikea building was taken on to \u201cenable an exciting and ambitious refurbishment project\u201d called The City Centre Cultural Gateway.\nThe site, which has been vacant since the store closed in 2020, will host a collections centre once work is finished.\nConstruction is due to begin in August and is estimated to be finished by the end of 2025.\n\u201cCovid slowed the original timescales down and inflation pressures have seen costs rise,\u201d the council spokesperson said.\n\u201cAlthough we have found some interim uses for the building including a number of film and production company uses, we also took on some additional operating costs last financial year including business rates.\u201d\nOf the St Mary\u2019s Guildhall costs, the spokesperson said the site reopened in July 2022 following the refurbishment.\n\u201cLike all new businesses and against the backdrop of high inflation and the cost-of-living crisis, this will take time,\u201d they added.\n\u201cHowever, we are working closely with the team to boost the level of visitor numbers in all aspects of the business and we are confident that this is achievable.\u201d\nAccording to the council report, overall the authority overspent on services by \u00a314.2m with social care and housing accounting for almost half of the figure.\nThis was mostly offset by \u00a312.4m savings made across other budgets and a \u00a35m dividend from a council-run waste disposal company.\nCouncillors will be asked to plug the remaining \u00a31.8m hole with reserves during meetings in the next few days.\nThe publication of the report came after the authority agreed to \u00a38.5m worth of cuts to services including switching off street lights overnight, reducing council tax discount and increasing car parking fees.\nThe council was recently criticised over the Ikea project by charity Coventry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre after its \u00a3200,000 contract was not renewed by the authority.\nThis news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The director of a training organisation for people with learning disabilities has said that finding Nazi symbols outside his shop was \"shocking and disturbing\".\nDavid Edmont is a managing director of the Bridge Association, a not-for-profit training organisation, who run Hug a Mug ability cafe in Castle Mall in Antrim.\nSwastikas were sprayed on the main entrance of the shopping centre and the external wall at the back of their shop, was sprayed with Nazi symbols overnight on Sunday. \nHe said it was particularly hard for those trainees who \"don't fully understand the situation\".\nAfter asking what the symbols meant, staff with learning disabilities had to be reassured that the graffiti was \"nothing to do with them\".\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said they are investigating five reports of racist graffiti and are treating them as racially motivated hate crimes.\nOn Tuesday, a 30-year-old man was arrested and later released on bail by police investigating the incidents.\nSpeaking on the BBC's The Nolan Show earlier, Mr Edmont explained the \"horror\" of having to explain the symbols to staff.\n\"Our adults have learning disabilities and they do not understand the tension that goes on,\" he added.\nMr Edmont called for the newly-elected MP for South Antrim, Ulster Unionist Robin Swann, to take action. \nSpeaking at Stormont on Monday, Mr Swann said he had asked to meet police to discuss the racist graffiti.\nNorthern Ireland Policing Board chairman Mukesh Sharma said the spate of \"particularly sinister\" racist graffiti is \"condemned\" by the board.\n\"Those who perpetrate hate crime are intent on creating a climate of fear where people don\u2019t feel safe and are afraid,\" he said.\n\"If hate crime is to be eradicated from our society then it needs a collective societal response, in parallel with a policing one.\"\nMr Sharma added how the PSNI responds to hate crime is an area that the board \"does keep under close review\" and that it has asked the chief constable for \"renewed focus to be brought to securing better criminal justice outcomes for hate crimes perpetrated\".\nIn a statement, the PSNI said it received reports of racist graffiti daubed on properties in five areas of the town between Sunday and Monday morning.\nThe areas affected were Parkhall Road, Fountainhill, Craigmore Park, Market Street area and the Castle Mall.\n\"Local police will work with partners to have the graffiti removed, and a noticeable policing presence will continue this week in and around the Antrim and wider area,\" the statement added.\nPatrick Corrigan, Northern Ireland director of human rights charity Amnesty International, said that the graffiti was part of a \"sustained campaign of sectarian and racist intimidation across Antrim going back to May\".\n\"This isn\u2019t just a bit of graffiti, this is forced displacement of people from their homes by an organised violent campaign of intimidation\", he told the Nolan Show.\nHe called on the police and lawful authorities to \"bring those responsible to account\" and \"send a clear signal that this is not acceptable in Northern Ireland in 2024\".\nHe said that those responsible were \"organised\", \"armed probably\" and \"certainly dangerous paramilitary gangs\". \n\"The sad fact is through campaign of intimidation the racists are winning because people have been forced out of the community\".",

    "Labour has announced plans to build on the \"grey belt\", as it tries to meet its pledge for 1.5 million new homes over the next five years.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said an overhaul of planning rules would see councils in England expected to prioritise building on brownfield sites and poor quality areas in the green belt.\nLabour has previously described the grey belt as \"poor quality and ugly areas\" - including disused car parks and wasteland - on parts of protected land, called the green belt.\nThe green belt, which was established more than 70 years ago, covers about 13% of England. Its aim was to limit the growth of large built-up areas and to stop large towns merging into one another.\nLabour wants grey belt land to be used for new homes, with half to be affordable housing.\nIt has pointed to a disused garage in Tottenham, north London, as an example of a green belt site that cannot be developed into housing because of its designation.\nHowever, Sam Stafford from the Home Builders Federation says it is crucial that the new grey belt is clearly defined.\n\"If you don\u2019t properly define what the grey belt is, what\u2019s to stop existing green belt land becoming 'scrubby' and 'ugly' just so it can be sold for development? If it\u2019s going to be a new class land of it needs to be defined in an objective and robust way.\"\nFor example, former golf courses and land used for mineral extraction could be designated as grey belt, Mr Stafford suggests.\nUnder the current rules, it is very hard to build on the green belt. Applicants need to demonstrate very special circumstances to justify planning permission.\nAs the grey belt will be a new category, there is no official data on how much of it exists.\nHowever, estate agent Knight Frank has previously carried out its own analysis.\nIt has identified 11,000 previously developed sites, making up less than 1% of the existing green belt.\nThe sites are mainly concentrated in the south of England with just over 40% within the London green belt area.\nIn total, 100,000-200,000 new family homes could be built on the sites according to Knight Frank.\nNevertheless, Mr Stafford believes that building on both the grey belt and additional brownfield sites in urban areas will be necessary to meet England\u2019s housing needs. \n\"There just isn\u2019t the land within major towns and cities to meet the housing need in its entirety,\" he said.\nTo support his claim, Mr Stafford points to a 2022 report by planning consultancy Lichfields which found that even if every identified brownfield site in England was built to its full capacity, that would mean 1.4 million extra homes.\nThat is less than the housing target of both major parties ahead of the election. Labour pledged 1.5 million new homes in England and the Conservatives 1.6 million.\nLabour says the grey belt developments must offer 50% affordable housing. This includes homes that are let at least 20% below local market rents.\nHowever, Charlie Hart from Knight Frank says this could be hard to achieve as inflation has significantly pushed up costs for developers.\nKatie Townsend from the Centre for London think tank says that although the plan is for grey belt homes to be built by private developers, the government should consider stepping in.\n\u201cThe best way to ensure affordable houses are built, particularly socially rented homes, is to increase government investment\u201d, she says.\nLabour floated the idea of creating the grey belt long before the election.\nWhen Sir Keir Starmer mentioned it over a year ago, then prime minister Rishi Sunak ruled it out as he \"wanted to make sure our green spaces are protected\".\nBuilding on the green belt is controversial.\nHowever, Ms Townsend of the Centre for London says attitudes might be shifting, pointing to polling showing half of Londoners supported building strategically on low-quality areas of the green belt, with only 19% against it.\nOthers disagree. Countryside charity CPRE Oxfordshire, for example, says land is \"already under enormous pressure\".\nIts director Helen Marshall says: \"Ten years ago we commissioned research which showed that over 70% of Oxfordshire wanted the green belt to remain undeveloped.\n\"Ten years later support for the green belt has increased to over 80%.\"\nHowever, Mr Hart of Knight Frank says that while the green belt used to be seen as a \"don\u2019t go zone\", perceptions are shifting.\n\"It was conceived a long long time ago and the world is a very different place and we\u2019re now reviewing whether it\u2019s fit for purpose in the modern world.\"\nAdditional reporting by Gerry Georgieva\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

It takes a long time to get them fixed - you have to find a suitable stone mason and that can take months.\"\nHe added that although the gateway - which sits at a crossroads along the A515 - was a \"tight squeeze\", most \"capable drivers\" could get through without any issues.\nMr FitzHerbert said it cost \u00a315,000 to replace the pillar in March following a \"very similar incident\" last year. \n\"Everybody in the village thinks it's absolutely ridiculous now. We need to solve this problem once and for all,\" he said. \nHe is considering applying for planning permission to move the pillars but warned this would involve going through \"numerous hurdles\".\nThe Peak District National Park Authority said it had been in touch with Mr FitzHerbert regarding his ongoing concerns about the gates and confirmed Listed Building Consent would be required to make changes.\nA spokesperson said: \"We share the frustrations of recurring damage to the gate posts and officers are awaiting further instruction from Sir Richard\u2019s team to take forward any potential proposals, by application, that may support mitigating against similar damage in the future. \n\"This could include moving the posts to set back and increase the width of the entrance area.\n\"Other than through agreed plans and conditions attached to a planning permission, issues of costs and implementation of any changes made would not be a responsibility or matter of direct consideration for the National Park Authority.\" \nA Derbyshire County Council spokesperson said: \u201cWe are sorry to hear that the gates have been knocked down again. \n\"The gates do not belong to the council, but we are happy to work with Sir Richard to see if we can find a solution to stop them being damaged in the future, although any changes would need to be agreed by the Peak District National Park Authority.\n\"The gates are set well back from the main road so they do not affect the accident rates on this stretch.

    "The Supreme Court has ruled a flight being cancelled because of a pilot becoming ill before work did not count as an \"extraordinary circumstance\", meaning passengers were entitled to compensation.\nIt said the decision \"has the potential to affect tens of thousands of claims which are made annually\" under the relevant law.\nKenneth and Linda Lipton took BA Cityflyer, an arm of British Airways, to court after their claim was rejected.\nFive Supreme Court judges dismissed the airline's appeal against an earlier Court of Appeal ruling.\nThe Liptons, from Kent, were due to fly from Milan Linate Airport in Italy to London City Airport in January 2018. The pilot didn't show up for work because they were unwell. A replacement couldn't be found. \nThe couple were rebooked onto another flight, which got them to London just over 2.5 hours later than scheduled.\nThey claimed the equivalent of about \u00a3220 in compensation for this delay, under EU regulations.\nAirlines have a defence if they can show that a cancellation happened because of unavoidable extraordinary circumstances.\nCityflyer turned down the claim, arguing that the pilot falling ill was such a situation.\nTwo courts agreed, but the Court of Appeal ruled in the Liptons' favour.\n\nThe company took its case to the Supreme Court, which unanimously dismissed its appeal.\nIn their judgment - which was backed by three other justices - Lord Sales and Lady Rose said it \"does not matter\" when the pilot fell ill, as the crew member remained an \"inherent part of the airline's operation\" even when not on duty.\nThey said not coming to work because something had \"[gone] awry\" during rest periods did not count as an extraordinary circumstance.\nIn a statement issued by law firm Irwin Mitchell following the ruling, Mr and Mrs Lipton said they \"never wanted to be in this position\".\nThey described their win as \"a victory for people who are prepared to fight for common sense and justice against corporate behemoths who have access to every resource\".\nRocio Concha from consumer group Which? described the Supreme Court's decision as \"highly significant for travellers, confirming as we head into the busy summer period that staff illness is not an acceptable reason to deny paying compensation for significant delays or cancellations\".\nA spokesperson for BA said: \"We are disappointed with this decision and respect the judgment of the court.\"\n",
    "The exams watchdog says it will fine an exam board \u00a3300,000 over \"major failings\" with the papers sat by health and science T-level students in 2022.\nOfqual said it had had to take \"unprecedented\" action against the exam board, NCFE, to get 1,200 students' results recalculated.\nOne of the 700 students whose grades were amended as a result told BBC News her T-level had been a \"wasted two years\".\nNCFE chief executive David Gallagher said the board had apologised to students, providers and parents and taken steps to avoid it happening again.\nThe exam board used to be known as the Northern Council for Further Education but now operates nationally as NCFE.\nT-levels were introduced by the Conservative government, in 2020, as a vocational option for students in England to take after their GCSEs. \nEach course lasts two years and is roughly equivalent to three A-levels.\nLabour did not mention T-levels specifically in its election manifesto but did say it would work on a strategy for post-16 education to address a \"widespread\" skills shortage.\nOfqual said NCFE had failed to develop \"valid question papers\" for its T-level qualifications in healthcare, healthcare science, and science.\nA petition to change the results, launched in August 2022, before the papers were regraded, reached 1,200 signatures.\nOne of those who signed the petition, Grace Darnbrough, now 18, from Rochdale, feels her cohort of healthcare T-level students were \"like guinea pigs\", being tested on a course that \"wasn't ready to be ran\".\nShe remembers her heart sinking and feeling \"blindsided\" during her science exam, which  included questions that had \"nothing to do with\" what she had been taught about.\nMs Darnbrough had hoped to take a paramedic course at university but was not accepted, which she feels is in part because of the grading issues.\n\"It's impacted my future,\" she says.\n\"They said [T-levels] were going to be the new BTec - they were going to be the same, if not better - it was going to be this amazing thing. \n\"And unfortunately, it didn't live up to its standard. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. \n\"I wasted two years of my career.\"\nMs Darnbrough has since left college and started an emergency-medical-technician apprenticeship, which she says is better equipping her with the skills she needs.\nShe welcomed the NCFE being fined but said: \"That's not going to change our future [or] take us back to where we deserve to be. \n\"If that course was run well, I would have been able to save a year and be into the career I want to be in - and I've been unable to do that.\n\"I think we do need compensating, because they've wasted our time.\"\nThe number of students taking T-levels has increased each year since they started, and there were 16,085 entrants in the 2023-24 academic year.\nAs well as classroom learning, the courses - covering practical, rather than academic, subjects such as construction, agriculture, education and engineering - involve an occupational specialism and a work placement.\nStudents have to achieve at least a grade E in their core component, a pass in their occupational specialism and meet the industry placement requirements.\nAs part of the rollout, the Conservative government had been withdrawing funding for other post-16 courses, such as BTecs, which were deemed to \"overlap\" with the new T-level programmes.\nHowever, issues such as low take-up of T-levels, a lack of awareness of the qualification among employers and overly complex assessments have led to calls for the new Labour government to pause and review that process.\nCritics have also pointed to high dropout rates among the T-level cohort who completed their courses last summer.\nFigures showed only 66% of T-level students completed their course in 2023. \nThe A-level retention rate, by comparison, was 95%, while for vocational alternatives such as applied general qualifications, it was 92%.\nAnd some in the further-education sector say the problems with the health and science exams, sat by a large portion of that same T-level cohort in their first year of study, could be partly behind the high dropout rate last year.\nAn Ofqual investigation into the 2022 exam papers had identified a number of breaches of the rules awarding organisations legally had to follow, the watchdog said.\nThey included a failure by NCFE to ensure the right processes were followed in developing the assessments, as well as failing to identify risks that could impede their delivery.\nFurther breaches had been identified during the 2023 summer exam season, Ofqual said.\nOfqual's notice of its intention to fine sets out how parties might make representations before a final decision is made, although NCFE told BBC News  it accepted the outcome and proposed fine.\nThe \u00a3300,000 fine was a \"significant\" penalty, Ofqual said.\nThe watchdog's largest fine was a \u00a31.2m penalty issued to Pearson in June 2022 over exams held between 2016 and 2019.\nAll interventions made by the regulatory body are published on the gov.uk websi",

    "Swedish human rights activist Anna Ardin is glad Julian Assange is free.\nBut the claims she has made about him suggest she would have every reason not to wish him well.\nShe is one of two women who accused the WikiLeaks founder of sexual assault 14 years ago.\nThe allegations - which Assange has always denied - were explosive, and made headlines across the world. They set off a chain of events which saw him trying to avoid extradition to Sweden by seeking asylum in a London embassy for seven years.\nIn 2019 the Swedish authorities ended their investigation. However, he spent the next five years in a British prison fighting extradition to the US, where he faced prosecution over massive leaks of confidential information. \nThese include US army footage showing Iraqi civilians being killed, and documents suggesting the US military killed hundreds of Afghan civilians in unreported incidents.\nAssange was eventually freed last month, after a plea deal with the US.\nArdin is fiercely proud of Assange's work for WikiLeaks, and insists that it should never have landed him behind bars.\n\u201cWe have the right to know about the wars that are fought in our name,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI\u2019m sincerely happy for him and his family, that they can be together. The punishment he\u2019s got has been very unproportionate.\u201d\nSpeaking to Ardin over Zoom in Stockholm, it quickly becomes clear that she has no problem keeping what she sees as the two Assanges apart in her head - the visionary activist and the man who she says does not treat women well.\nShe is at pains to describe him neither as a hero nor a monster, but a complicated man.\nThe 45-year-old activist is also a Christian deacon, with a belief in forgiveness, and she uses the words \"truth\" and \"transparency\" again and again throughout the interview. It might explain why she is in awe of what WikiLeaks accomplished but, at the same time, bitterly disappointed that the assault allegations she made against Assange were never formally tested.\nArdin describes her encounter with Assange in her book, No Heroes, No Monsters: What I Learned Being The Most Hated Woman On The Internet.\nIn 2010, just three weeks after WikiLeaks\u2019 release of the Afghan war logs, she invited him to Stockholm to take part in a seminar organised by the religious wing of Sweden\u2019s Social Democrats.\nAssange did not want to stay at a hotel for security reasons and Ardin was due to be away, so she offered him her flat. But she returned early.\nAfter an evening of discussing politics and human rights, they ended up having what she describes as uncomfortable sex during which she says he humiliated her.\nArdin says she was pressured into having sex with Assange and stressed he must use a condom, but the condom broke and he continued.\nShe says he deliberately broke the condom. If this was the case, he probably would have committed an offence under Swedish law.\nLater, Ardin writes that she heard from another woman - named in legal papers as SW - who had attended the seminar. SW apparently said that Assange had penetrated her without her consent when she was asleep. \nIn a 2016 statement to Swedish prosecutors, Assange maintained that his sexual relationship with SW was entirely consensual, and that in texts seen by his lawyers, she told a friend that she had been \u201chalf asleep\u201d.\nBoth women filed police reports - Ardin's case was categorised as alleged sexual misconduct, and SW's as alleged rape.\nThe press got hold of the reports, setting off an extraordinary series of events.\nAssange denied the allegations, and suggested that they were a US set-up. WikiLeaks had just leaked 76,000 US military documents - sparking massive global attention and scrutiny of US foreign policy.\nOn 21 August, 2010, WikiLeaks tweeted: \u201cWe were warned to expect \u2018dirty tricks\u2019. Now we have the first one.\u201d\nAnother post followed the next day: \u201cReminder: US intelligence planned to destroy WikiLeaks as far back as 2008.\u201d\nAssange\u2019s UK lawyer Mark Stephens claimed that a \u201choneytrap\u201d had been sprung and that \u201cdark forces\u201d were at work.\nA social media furore erupted which Ardin describes as \u201chell\u201d \u2013 she tells me the amount of harassment and death threats forced her to leave Sweden at one point.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t work. My life passed me by for two years.\u201d\nTo this day, many believe Ardin is part of a US conspiracy, and that her allegations are false. Greece\u2019s former Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, a long-time supporter of Assange, last week described her claims as \u201cmud\u201d and \u201cinnuendo\u201d.\nNo evidence has ever been found to link Ardin with US intelligence. She concedes that the narratives spread by Assange had an air of plausibility, because he had been \u201cmessing with the Pentagon\u201d, but says the claims were nothing but \u201clies\u201d and a \u201csmear campaign\u201d.\nMonths after the incidents, an international arrest warrant was issued for Assange, who was in London at that point.\nIn December 2010, he admitted to the BBC that it was \u201cnot probable\u201d he was part of a classic honey-trap operation - but he sti",

Her parents worked in education and she won a place to study law at Oxford from her state comprehensive.\nMs Tidball said there was already a \"real sense of community\" among the new MPs as they settled in, and described voting for the new Speaker for the first time in the chamber as an \"amazing experience\".\nShe was seated close to Sir Keir Starmer during his maiden speech as prime minister, though colleagues such as Katie White (Leeds North West) and Harpreet Uppal (Huddersfield) had to watch from the gallery as the benches were full.\nMs Tidball added: \"It was just something else. There is a huge sense of pride that so many people in the country backed a huge number of Labour MPs. It was a poignant moment. \n\"Being sworn in was hugely emotional, as you think of all the people at home who put their trust in you and sent you here.\" \nKeighley and Ilkley is a \"bellwether\" seat which means it is normally won by whoever wins the election.\nLabour targeted it in 2024, after Robbie Moore won it for the Conservatives in 2019 with a majority they felt they could overturn.\nYet Mr Moore was returned as MP again by a margin of 1,625 votes in a constituency with a healthy 62% turnout.\nMr Moore now resumes his work in the Commons as an opposition MP after his seat bucked the traditions of a bellwether.\nHe said: \"Sitting in the chamber feels completely different. \n\"The nature of the job will change, particularly down in Westminster, but for me the day job doesn't actually change.\n\"I will always put the constituency first and at the heart of everything I do.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats had a resurgent time at the polls, and added 64 new MPs to bring their total to 72.\nOne of the newcomers was Tom Gordon, who won Harrogate and Knaresborough from the Conservatives and overturned Andrew Jones's 9,675 majority.\nThe Lib Dems' performance means they have reclaimed their position as the third party in the Commons.\nMr Gordon grew up in Knottingley, near Wakefield, and worked in policy roles in the charity sector before launching a political career.\nHe said: \"There have been some interesting conversations about who sits where in the Commons chamber, and we arrived early for the first sitting to ensure the Lib Dems had somewhere to sit. \n\"The experience of being in the chamber for the first time was surreal, and watching Starmer's address was a 'pinch myself' moment.\"\nIqbal Mohamed won the new Dewsbury and Batley seat to become the first independent MP elected at a general election in Yorkshire since 1907.\nHe attributed a majority of around 7,000 to support among young Muslim voters for his pro-Palestinian stance.\nHowever, Mr Mohamed now sits in the Commons without the support of a party machine behind him.\nHe grew up in Dewsbury as the son of Indian immigrants, and went on to study at Durham University and work as an IT consultant.\nMr Mohamed said: \"Everyone has been friendly and helpful. Entering the Commons is the most honoured and privileged position.\n\"It is very humbling to walk in as a single person representing 70,000 voters. \n\"The job is not a burden; it gives me energy and enthusiasm.

    "The Scottish government has been advised to formally pause puberty blockers until further research has been carried out.\nThe advice is one of several recommendations from a team looking into how the Cass review on gender services for children and young people could be applied in Scotland.\nOther suggestions include ensuring a lead senior clinician takes overall responsibility for each young person\u2019s care and that work on a regional service for children should begin immediately. \nNeil Gray, the Scottish health secretary, said the report's findings would now be considered and used in \"reforming and improving\" gender healthcare across the country.  \nThe Cass review was published in April by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass, and called for gender services for young people to match the standards of other NHS care. \nA number of conclusions - including saying medical justification for treatments like puberty blockers was \"remarkably weak\" - proved politically contentious, with Dr Cass saying some critics were spreading misinformation about her work. \nAt the time of publication it was criticised by the Scottish Greens, who at that stage were part of the Scottish government. \nPublic Health Minister Jenni Minto told MSPs on 23 April that although the Cass review looked at services provided by NHS England, the findings would also be carefully considered in Scotland.\nGlasgow's Sandyford Clinic took the decision to stop new patients aged 16 or 17  receiving other hormone treatments until they were 18, a decision that was criticised by the charity Scottish Trans.\nThe new findings suggest this decision - taken by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde - should became formal government policy in the future.\nThe report stated: \"The use of puberty-supressing hormones \u2013 commonly referred to as puberty blockers \u2013 should be paused until further clinical trials can be undertaken. \n\"NHS Scotland will continue to engage in the forthcoming UK study.\"\nThe Scottish government was criticised for releasing its response on the day after the general election.\nScottish Conservative deputy leader Meghan Gallacher described the move as a \"cowardly attempt to sneak this out when everyone\u2019s gaze is elsewhere\".\nShe added that it was \"not good enough\" that MSPs would have to wait weeks before questioning the government.\nThe findings - carried out by a multi-disciplinary team commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland - also found that each care plan should include \"a full assessment of the child\u2019s needs, both psychological and physical.\"\nProfessor Graham Ellis, Scotland's Deputy Chief Medical Officer said the team had examined the Cass report from a \"clinical perspective\" while remembering that all children should grow up \"safe, respected and supported.\"  \nHe added: \u201cAt the heart of this question are children and young people in distress, and our ambition must remain focused on meeting their needs with holistic, person-centred care as close to home as practical.\n\u201cThe Cass Review identified the need to ensure that gender identity services for young people are more closely aligned with other areas of clinical practice, and that responsibility for the full range of services required should extend beyond specialist services.\"\nMr Gray said the Scottish government would provide a further update on the newest report, and possible implementation in Scotland, after the Scottish Parliament's summer recess. \nLike other parts of the UK, Scotland has seen a surge in the number of young people questioning their identity or experiencing gender dysphoria.\nThe Sandyford is the only specialist service for under-18s in Scotland, with a freedom of information request from BBC Scotland News revealing that at the end of 2023, 1,100 patients were on the waiting list for the centre.\nIn Scotland, 43 patients will continue to receive either puberty blockers or \"gender affirming hormones\" such as testosterone or oestrogen, as they were prescribed the treatments before the April decision was made.

    "Sir Keir Starmer has delivered a speech at the Tate Modern art gallery in central London, shortly after Rishi Sunak publicly conceded defeat. Here it is, in full.\n\"We did it!\n\"You campaigned for it. You fought for it. You voted for it. And now it has arrived. Change begins now. And it feels good, I have to be honest. \n\"Four-and-a-half years of work changing the party. This is what it is for. \n\"A changed Labour party ready to serve our country. Ready to restore Britain to the service of working people. \n\"And across our country people will be waking up to the news, relieved that a weight has been lifted, a burden finally removed from the shoulders of this great nation. \n\"And now we can look forward. Walk into the morning, the sunlight of hope, pale at first but getting stronger through the day, shining once again, on a country with the opportunity after 14 years to get its future back.\u201d\n\"And I want to thank each and every one of you here for campaigning so hard for change and not just in this campaign either. Also for the four-and-a-half years changing our party.\n\"The Labour movement is always everything's achieved - past and future - down to the efforts of its people. So thank you truly. You have changed our country.\n\"But a mandate like this comes with a great responsibility. Our task is nothing less than renewing the ideas that hold this country together - national renewal. \n\"Whoever you are, wherever you started in life, if you work hard, if you play by the rules, this country should give you a fair chance to get on. It should always respect your contribution and we have to restore that. \n\"And alongside that, we have to return politics to public service. Show that politics can be a force for good.  \n\"Make no mistake, that is the great test of politics in this era. The fight for trust is the battle that defines our age.  It is why we have campaigned so hard on demonstrating we are fit for public service. \n\"Service is the precondition for hope. Respect the bond that can unite a country. \n\"Together, the values of this changed Labour party are the guiding principle for a new government. Country first, party second. \n\"That is the responsibility of this mandate. You know 14 years ago we were told that we are all in it together. I say to the British people today imagine what we could do if that were actually true.\n\"So, by all means enjoy this moment. Nobody can say you haven't waited patiently. Enjoy the feeling of waking up on a morning like this with the emotion that you do see the country through the same eyes. \n\"Hold on to it because it is what unity is made from, but use it to show to the rest of the country, as we must, that this party has changed. \n\"That we will serve them faithfully, govern for every single person in this country. But also don't forget how we got here. \n\"This morning we can see that the British people have voted to turn the page on 14 years. But don't pretend that there was anything inevitable about that. \n\"There's nothing preordained in politics. Election victories don't fall from the sky. They're hard won and hard fought for and this one could only be won by a changed Labour party. \n\"We have the chance to repair our public services because we changed the party. We have have the chance to make work pay because we changed the party. We have the chance to deliver for working people, young people, vulnerable people,  the poorest in society because we changed the party.\n\"Country first, party second isn't a slogan. It's the guiding principle of everything we've done and must keep on doing. \n\"On the economy, on national security, on protecting our borders, the British people had to look us in the eye and see that we could serve their interests and that work doesn't stop now, it never stops. \n\"The changes we've made are permanent, irreversible and we must keep going. We ran as a changed Labour party and we will govern as a changed Labour party. \n\"I don't promise you it will be easy. Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. It's hard work, patient work, determined work. \n\"And we will have to get moving immediately but even when the going gets tough and it will, remember, tonight and always, what this is all about. \n\"Now I may have mentioned my parents a few times in this campaign - once or twice - but the sense of security we have, the comfort they took from believing that Britain would always be better for their children. \n\"The hope, not high-minded, not idealistic, but a hope that working class families like mine could build their lives around. \n\"It is hope that may not burn brightly in Britain at the moment but we have earned the mandate to relight the fire. \n\"That is the purpose of this party and of this government. We said we would end the chaos and we will.\n\"We said we would turn the page, and we have. Today we start the next chapter. begin the work of change, the mission of national renewal and start to rebuild our country. Thank you.\"",

    "Labour won every seat in South Yorkshire as Sir Keir Starmer's party swept to power. But they faced stiff competition in Barnsley from Reform UK in the general election. Could Nigel Farage's party threaten the so-called Red Wall in the future? \nThe BBC spoke to voters in the wake of the results.\nIn his first speech as Prime Minister in Downing Street, Sir Keir Starmer vowed his Labour government would \u201crebuild Britain with wealth\u201d.\nAt the same time, 170 miles away in South Yorkshire, Kayleigh Lang was packing up stock as she prepared to shut down her struggling florist shop later this month.\nThe 31-year-old opened Cottage Flowers in the village of Hoyland, near Barnsley, three years ago but said running the business had become \u201cimpossible\u201d.\n\u201cLook at the times we\u2019re living in, the cost of living,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cPrices have gone ridiculously high and nobody\u2019s doing owt to get things back down. It\u2019s just hard.\u201d\nMs Lang was glad to see the back of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservatives, who she said had offered \u201cnothing\u201d to support small businesses. The mother-of-two said she was hopeful Labour may bring change but did not \u201chave much faith\u201d in them.\nAlong with 11,650 other people in the constituency of Barnsley South, she voted for Reform UK in 4 July\u2019s general election.\nHer husband Ben Lang, 34, would also have backed the party had he not been thwarted by voter ID rules introduced last year.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t find my driving licence,\u201d he laughed.\nReform UK\u2019s focus on cutting immigration has won the couple\u2019s support, with Mr Lang saying the government should be \u201clooking after our own\u201d.\nMs Lang\u2019s shop - which imports flowers from the Netherlands - has suffered from increased costs in the wake of Brexit, but the florist said she did not blame Reform UK leader and Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage.\nShe said: \u201cFor me, the Conservatives were in [power] and they should have been picking it up and working it. They haven\u2019t - it\u2019s a flop, it\u2019s not benefited anybody.\u201d\nFor a few hours on Thursday night, it looked as though Mr Farage\u2019s party could be on course for a shock victory in South Yorkshire.\nExit polls suggested David White was likely to oust Labour\u2019s Stephanie Peacock to win Barnsley South. Robert Lomas - who was dropped by Reform UK days before the election over alleged racist comments but still appeared as the party\u2019s candidate on ballot papers - was forecast to finish first ahead of Labour\u2019s Dan Jarvis in neighbouring Barnsley North.\nThe polls proved to be wide of the mark - Mr White and Mr Lomas both came second, well behind Labour. But each finished thousands of votes ahead of their third-placed Conservative rivals.\n\u201cWe dared to dream for a couple of hours - it was quite exciting,\u201d said Mr White, who won 33% of the vote in Barnsley North.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got massive support in Barnsley,\u201d he added. \u201cFor a party that\u2019s less than three years old \u2026 to be the main challenger to Labour in South Yorkshire is a fantastic result.\u201d\nReform had identified Barnsley - where turnout is typically among the lowest in the country - as a key target area. Mr Farage visited the town on the campaign trail in June - and was pelted with coffee cups by a protester.\nBut Mr Farage received a warmer welcome during a charm offensive in Hoyland that day, according to Ms Lang.\n\u201cHe came and said hello to everyone, he was a good guy. Just no nonsense, he says it like it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she said.\nNeil Barker, 62, another Reform UK voter, said he felt the party \u201cjust seem to speak common sense\u201d.\nThe recently retired electrician, enjoying a pint outside the Beggar and Gentleman pub on Friday, added he had also been wooed by Mr Farage\u2019s pledge to raise the income tax threshold to \u00a320,000.\n\u201cWhen we do start to draw our state pensions, we\u2019ll be paying tax on it,\u201d said Mr Barker, whose wife Michelle, 58, voted the same way as him.\n\u201cIf it goes up to \u00a320,000, I\u2019m 20% better off,\u201d he added.\nThe couple said they would reserve judgement on Sir Keir\u2019s government but each felt \u201cwe needed a change\u201d.\nThree miles east of Hoyland, in the village of Wombwell, even some Labour voters said they could see the appeal of Mr Farage.\nStanding outside the Horseshoe pub, Karen Norris said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can help but like him. He\u2019s a character isn\u2019t he? And I think people just want change.\u201d\nBut the 49-year-old nurse said she would have considered a vote for Reform \u201ca wasted vote, because they\u2019d never have got in,\u201d adding: \u201cNot this time anyway.\u201d\nOther Labour voters warned the party would have to work hard to retain their support.\nAlan Nixon, 79, said: \u201cWe\u2019ll give Starmer a couple of years, if he\u2019s no good, kick him out. Not wait five years. Not wait five years, get him out.\n\"But we\u2019ll give him a chance, give him opportunity to make life better for the poor people like me and everybody else round here.\u201d\nUsually a Labour supporter, Mr Nixon voted for Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives in 2019\u2019s general election - but said the government had been \u201cterrible\u201d.\nThis time around, he said he would hav",
    "Thousands of people have attended the annual Orange Order parade in the seaside village of Rossnowlagh, County Donegal.\nAround 50 lodges were at the gathering which traditionally takes place on the Saturday before the main Twelfth demonstrations in Northern Ireland.\nThe lodges were from Donegal as well as the border counties of Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan and brethren from across Northern Ireland. \nForty bands were also on parade.\nSome visitors travelled from overseas to take part. They were there to attend the Imperial Orange Council in Enniskillen this year and have taken the opportunity to come to Donegal to sample the parade.\nDonegal County Grand Master David Mahon said it was always a family-friendly day for all with the major concern usually the weather.\nPrior to the march, Mr Mahon told BBC News NI ''we expect to have a good day here in Rossnowlagh.\"\n\"We also have lots of visitors from across the world who\u2019re here for the Imperial Orange Council which is meeting in Northern Ireland. \n\"So we\u2019ll have people from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ghana as well as England, Scotland and Wales. They are really looking forward to the parade and they\u2019ll be right up at the front as we set off.\"\nThe Imperial Orange Council is a triennial gathering of delegates representing World Orangeism.\nStuart Brooker, the deputy Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, was delighted Enniskillen could host the gathering after it had to be postponed due to Covid. \n\u201cThe objective and the aims of the Imperial Orange Council are to take into consideration the state of Orangeism and Protestantism generally,\" Mr Brooker said. \n\"It is particularly special for us to host this in beautiful Fermanagh in the west and get out of the city environment.\" \nIan Kells, who is originally from the Springfield area of Enniskillen, left Fermanagh 56 years ago shortly after the death of his father. \nHe was homesick and contacted the Orange Order in Australia. \nHe has since risen to become Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Australia. \nMr Kells said that when he first went to Australia they used to have parades through the centre of Sydney but now the lodge has formal dinners and get togethers. \n\u201cI was a member of a little lodge which at one time only had three members. But it has since grown as it's been helped by the immigration of young people from Scotland and Northern Ireland,\" he said.  \n\"We now have 22 members and I\u2019m the oldest.\u201d\nDonegal Grand Master David Mahon said the Orange Order was in a buoyant mood in the county and members looked forward to this day from one year to the next.\n\u201cThe atmosphere and the mood here in Donegal is always very good and some of our lodges are now seeing new members joining this year. So it\u2019s all looking good,\" he said. \nMr Mahon said there were always good relations between the organisation and the local Catholic community which he said worked in harmony.\nIn keeping with tradition, the parade started from St John\u2019s Parish Church and made its way along the picturesque narrow route down into the seaside village. \nHundreds of spectators were out along the way taking up vantage points to watch the demonstration.\nAfter the parade many marchers enjoyed a stroll along the vast beach which is popular with holiday-makers and surfers alike.\nHugh Reynolds travelled from Ballymena to watch the parade.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to get down to see all the different bands and meet old friends. It\u2019s a good day out,\" he said. \nVanessa Martin from Kesh in Fermanagh said she would not miss the Rossnowlagh parade. \n\u201cIts a lovely, relaxed day and I love it. As well as the parade you\u2019ve got a lovely beach too where you can go for a stroll,\u201d she added.\nThis was a special year for Raphoe District Orange Lodge. \nSpokesman Stewart McClean mentioned a new bannerette that was present at the march.\n\"The bannerette celebrates the 190th anniversary of the district lodge which was formed in 1834,\" he said. \n\"So a special day for the lodge and all its members and supporters and we\u2019ve been looking forward to displaying the bannerette to everyone in Donegal. It\u2019s been dedicated during the week before its unveiling at this parade.\"  \nAfter the religious service at the field, there was a return parade in the village.",

    "The new Labour government is replacing the words \"levelling up\" with \"local government\" in the department's name and ministerial titles, minister Jim McMahon has said.\nLevelling up - a promise to reduce geographical inequality - was a key part of Boris Johnson's successful 2019 general election campaign.\nWhen he came into power he changed the name of the Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government, replacing \"local government\" with \"levelling up\". \nHowever, Mr McMahon told BBC Breakfast the phrase was \"only ever a slogan\" and was now being \"firmly Tippex-ed out of the department\". \n\"We are now the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government,\" he said.\n\"It is a reshaping of the department. It is a refocus, but frankly it is also just grown up politics.\"\nA Conservative spokesperson said the levelling up agenda had been \"transformative for towns across the country, giving communities that Labour took for granted when they were last in office the investment they deserve.\n\"Labour\u2019s decision to scrap levelling up will be a disaster for these towns, and their refusal to rule out clawing back \u00a31bn of Conservative funding from local communities for Labour politicians to spend in Westminster puts the future of our communities at risk.\u201d\nFormer Prime Minister Boris Johnson accused Labour of \"a lack of ambition and a failure to believe in this country\u2019s potential\". \nMr McMahon said the British public had \"had enough of politicians making promises that don't follow through and don't make a material difference\". \nMr McMahon, who was previously the leader of Oldham Council, said he was pleased the words local government were being added back to the department name saying people valued local government and \"know it needs far more focus and attention\". \nShortly after his interview, Angela Rayner, now head of the rebranded department, confirmed the change in a social media post saying: \"No more gimmicks and slogans, but the hard yards of governing in the national interest. \n\"The department I lead will be the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.\"\nThe ditching of the levelling up phrase was welcomed by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who was in Downing Street for a meeting with all the mayors in England.\nHe told the BBC it had too often felt like a mantra for weakening the capital at the expense of the rest of the country.\nThe name-change also got the thumbs-up from former Conservative minister Sajid Javid who ran the department from 2016 to 2018. \nHe said: \"Whether housing, social care or community cohesion, local government has a big role to play in tackling policy challenges.\n\"A small change, but a welcome signal of intent.\"\nThe phrase may be gone, but the general direction of travel which underpinned levelling up - more devolution, more mayors with more powers, trying to find ways to improve \u2018left behind\u2019 areas - has recently been an area of cross-party consensus. It is likely to continue under the new government. \nSetting out the aims of the levelling up policy in 2022, then government minister Michael Gove said that: \"For far too long, the United Kingdom - England in particular - has had an economic powerhouse in London and the south east but not everyone has shared in that success.\"\nHe said the Brexit referendum in 2016 had been \"a wake-up call\" from overlooked and undervalued communities giving the government a \"clear instruction\" to change the country's economic model.\nUnder the last government, the Levelling Up Fund was set up to distribute nearly \u00a35bn to \"shovel-ready\" projects.\nThe North West of England received the most money overall, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber. In terms of funding per head of the population, Wales came out on top. \nUnder the fund, money was awarded to schemes aimed at boosting regeneration. Successful bids included Twycross Zoo in Bosworth, a swimming pool in Halifax and Rotherham town centre. \nThe fund attracted some criticism including from then-Conservative West Midlands Mayor Andy Street who said it was part of Whitehall's \"broken begging bowl culture\" and the money should be allocated by local-decision makers rather than civil servants in London. \nOther parts of the levelling up policy included a drive to move civil servants outside of London and setting up freeports - areas exempt from some taxes - in areas including Teesside, Hull and Portsmouth.

    "The Liberal Democrats have won the traditionally Conservative stronghold of Stratford-on-Avon in a general election that has seen the party make gains in many parts of the UK.\nThe Lib Dems' Manuela Perteghella said she was \u201chumbled\u201d to take the Warwickshire constituency - Shakespeare's birthplace and an area that has been almost entirely in Conservative hands since 1950.\nLabour won three seats from the Tories across the wider Coventry and Warwickshire region, bringing its tally to seven out of the 10 constituencies up for grabs locally and contributing to the party's national landslide win.\nMs Perteghella overturned a Tory majority of 13,395 to win the seat, which had been held by former chancellor Nadhim Zahawi since 2010. He announced in May he would step down at this election.\nMs Perteghella won 23,450 votes in total, giving her a majority of 7,122 over Conservative candidate Chris Clarkson.\n\"I'm very humbled to have been elected to represent my home,\" Ms Perteghella said.\nShe added residents wanted change after 14 years of \"this chaotic government\", saying she wanted to tackle sewage dumping in rivers and the cost-of-living crisis.\nSewage pollution, a key topic for the Lib Dems, had emerged as one of the big local issues for voters in the lead-up to polling on Thursday.\nThe election saw the Conservatives lose more than half their six MPs in Coventry and Warwickshire.\nIn the ten seats that were up for grabs, Labour now have seven seats compared to the four with which they began the campaign. The Lib Dems have one seat and the Tories have two.\nLabour\u2019s win in Nuneaton overnight was particularly significant as the seat has long been a bellwether for the national mood.\nAt every election since 1997, the party that won the Nuneaton seat has also won nationally.\nNursery worker Jodie Gosling won 15,216 votes, giving her a 3,479 majority over Conservative candidate Marcus Jones, who had been in place since 2010.\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy and can\u2019t wait to start work,\u201d Ms Gosling said.\nMr Jones said his loss was a \u201cvery difficult result\u201d and the party had to consider at a national level \u201cwhat went wrong in this last Parliament\u201d.\nLabour also won seats from the Tories in two further constituencies in the region, Rugby, and North Warwickshire and Bedworth.\nWarwick and Leamington was a Labour hold, while Kenilworth and Southam was held by the Tories who also won Meriden and Solihull East, a new constituency in the wake of boundary changes although with a Conservative MP in the previous Meriden form.\nLabour held on to its three seats in Coventry, with wins for Zarah Sultana, Mary Creagh and Taiwo Owatemi who stood in Coventry South, East and North West respectively.\nMs Owatemi said she had won despite \"a limited amount of sleep\" due to having a six-month-old daughter.\nIt was her first general election as a new mum and she praised her husband's support, saying \"it has taken a lot of teamwork\".\nReform UK came in third place in most of the constituencies in Coventry and Warwickshire, with the party widely seen as having taken votes from the Tories at a national level.\nWhen asked whether Reform UK had given Labour its win in Nuneaton, Ms Gosling said she did not think thar was the case and instead pointed to \u201cthe hard work of our campaigners\u201d.\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A mother has admitted giving her terminally ill seven-year-old son a large dose of morphine to stop his suffering and \"quietly end his life\".\nAntonya Cooper, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said her son Hamish had stage 4 cancer and was in \u201ca lot of pain\u201d before his death in 1981.\nNow facing a terminal diagnosis herself, she made the admission to BBC Radio Oxford as part of an effort to change the law on assisted dying.\nPolice said they were investigating her case. Assisted suicide - intentionally helping another person to end their life - and euthanasia - deliberately ending a person's life - are illegal in England. \nHamish had neuroblastoma, a rare cancer that mostly affects children.\nHe was five when diagnosed and was initially given a prognosis of three months.\nFollowing 16 months of \"beastly\" cancer treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital, his life was extended but he was left in great pain, according to his mother.\nShe said: \"On Hamish's last night, when he said he was in a lot of pain, I said: 'Would you like me to remove the pain?' and he said: 'Yes please, mama.'\n\"And through his Hickman Catheter, I gave him a large dose of morphine that did quietly end his life.\"\nBBC Radio Oxford asked the 77-year-old if she believed her son knew she was intending to end his life.\nShe replied: \"I feel very strongly that at the point of Hamish telling me he was in pain, and asking me if I could remove his pain, he knew, he knew somewhere what was going to happen.\n\"But I cannot obviously tell you why or how, but I was his mother, he loved his mother, and I totally loved him, and I was not going to let him suffer, and I feel he really knew where he was going.\"\nShe continued: \"It was the right thing to do. My son was facing the most horrendous suffering and intense pain, I was not going to allow him to go through that.\"\nAsked if she understood she was potentially admitting to manslaughter or murder, she replied: \"Yes.\"\n\"If they come 43 years after I have allowed Hamish to die peacefully, then I would have to face the consequences. But they would have to be quick, because I'm dying too,\" she added.\nFour decades after Hamish's death, his mother is coming to terms with her own incurable cancer.\nShe said his suffering and her own ill health had cemented her feelings on assisted deaths.\n\"We don't do it to our pets. Why should we do it to humans?\" she said.\nCampaigners for a so-called \"right to die\" have argued that people should be able to choose when and how to die in order to avoid suffering.\nCritics have said changing the law would \"place pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives\" for fear of being a financial or emotional burden.\nMPs recently discussed the issue at a parliamentary debate, at which the government said it was a matter of conscience for individual parliamentarians rather than one for government policy.\nIn a statement, Thames Valley Police said it was \"aware of reports relating to an apparent case of assisted dying of a seven-year-old boy in 1981\".\nIt added: \"At this early stage, the force is making inquiries into these reports and is not in a position to comment further while these investigations continue.\"\nThis is a hugely complex and highly controversial subject, and yet it is one that is gaining momentum.\nAssisted dying is the phrase used to describe a situation where someone who is terminally ill seeks medical help to obtain lethal drugs which they administer themselves. Assisted suicide, is helping another person end their life.\nBoth are illegal in the UK but recently, Scotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man all announced they are considering changing the law to let terminally ill people end their lives.\nOne hundred and ninety cases have been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service over a 15 year period.

    "The family of a woman who was kidnapped and murdered but whose body has never been found said they endured the torture of \"a thousand deaths\" after her disappearance. \nMuriel McKay was taken from her Wimbledon home in 1969 after she was mistaken for the then-wife of Rupert Murdoch, and held to ransom for \u00a31m at Rooks Farm in Hertfordshire.\nSpeaking ahead of a fresh dig starting this week to try and find Mrs McKay's remains at the farm, her children told of the \"torture\" they endured after Muriel went missing and how their telephone rang endlessly with requests from journalists, well-wishers and crank calls.\nArthur Hosein, who owned Rooks Farm, and his younger brother Nizamodeen Hosein, were subsequently jailed for life for Muriel's kidnap and murder.\nSpeaking to Jane MacSorley and Simon Farquhar for BBC Radio 4's new podcast Intrigue: Worse Than Murder, Muriel's son Ian McKay described how he was living in Australia and working with an artist on a book project when he learned of his mother's disappearance on a \"little transistor radio\".\nDescribing his arrival at the family home, where he joined his father Alick and sisters Dianne and Jennifer, Mr McKay said: \"I do remember quite distinctly going into the house and feeling my mother's presence. \n\"I cannot explain that.\"\nMr McKay told how the family received call after call from various people including journalists, strangers and crank callers.\nHe said every call was answered, and added: \"We were desperate.\n\"We had all sorts of cranks ringing up and saying: 'I know where she is or whatever'.\"\nMany of the crank callers asked for money.\n\"It's beyond comprehension,\" he said. \"You really find it hard to believe that people could behave in such an appalling way.\n\"We were absolutely dying a thousand deaths every day because we were hanging on every telephone call.\n\"This was the most incredible and torturous experience you can imagine - this just didn't happen over a few days. This went on for weeks.\"\nThe Hoseins were arrested on7 February 1970 and initially held at Kingston police station because of the press pack gathered outside the station in Wimbledon.\nIntrigue: Worse than Murder\nIn the winter of 1969, kidnappers targeting Rupert Murdoch\u2019s wife abducted Muriel McKay by mistake. She was never seen again. Jane MacSorley  and Simon Farquhar investigate this shocking crime which baffled police and remains unresolved.\nThe first episode of Radio 4\u2019s Intrigue: Worse Than Murder, is available now on BBC Sounds.\nMr McKay told how, shortly after the arrests, the lead officer in the case, Det Ch Supt Bill Smith, and Det Sgt John Minors, took him into the dining room of the family's home.\n\"They said, 'look, would you like to come down to the police station... we'll let you go in the cells - you can do whatever you like to them and no one will ever know'.\n\"I was quite taken aback,\" said Mr McKay. \"As far as I was concerned, it was not even a consideration.\"\nTo this day, Mr McKay remains unsure whether the offer was genuine or a mixture of \"bravado\", frustration - that the brothers were not answering their questions - and a sense of \"loyalty\" to the family.\n\"I just think they felt this need to be able to prove to us that they had done everything possible,\" he said.\n\"And I think they [the police] just saw our hurt.\"\nMr McKay told how he only kept the last two letters of about 120 sent to him by his mother.\nThe rest, he said, he incinerated because he was worried about intrusion into his private life should they fall into the wrong hands.\n\"Whilst there was nothing secret in there,\" he said. \"It was just something terribly personal.\"\nMight the Hoseins have been caught sooner?\nThe McKays' eldest child, Jennifer, thought a potentially vital piece of evidence she claimed to have found, shortly after the disappearance, was ignored.\nShe described arriving in London from their Sussex home the day after Muriel went missing. \nHer father, she said, was \"crazy\" with worry and \"didn\u2019t know what to do with himself\".\nThe family had no idea what had happened to Muriel. \n\u201cIt may be the IRA, it may be the mafia, we don\u2019t know what it is,\" she said. \n\"It was really extraordinary because it was seething with police officers and reporters in the house full stop, they were lined up along the curb outside for, well, weeks.\"\nThe home had been combed for evidence by the police. But Jennifer said she wanted to look around the home for herself.\n\"I wanted to walk around the house quietly,\" she said. \"I'm walking all rooms just to sort of see if I could feel anything different.\"\nBeneath a table in a small room close to the kitchen she spotted a photograph on the floor, she said. The image was of a group of men with a campervan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that isn\u2019t where it should be,\" she said.\nShe said she mentioned the discovery to Det Sgt Minors.\n\u201cAnd so I went in and said I'd just like to show you something I found,\" she said, adding she felt ignored and treated like a \"silly daughter\".\n\"He looked at it.

    "Proposals to tighten the restrictions on the sale of tobacco and nicotine products on the Isle of Man are set to be considered by a committee. \nMichelle Haywood had asked for permission to introduce a private member's bill in the House of Keys, but MHKs instead backed calls for a review of the measures proposed.\nDr Haywood had argued her proposals, which would prevent anyone born after 2008 from legally smoking, would \"protect children\" and \"save lives\".\nBut Tim Crookall said the bill could have \"unintended consequences\" and the subject matter would \"benefit from detailed scrutiny\".\nThe three-strong panel of MHKs of Dr Haywood, Stu Peters and Joney Faragher will consider proposed changes to the Children and Young Person's Act 1966 and the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2006.\nThe proposals put forward by Dr Haywood would expand the definition of tobacco goods to include newer products containing nicotine and strengthen the regulations surrounding their advertising and promotion.\nA \"generational clause\" that would \"prevent our children from acquiring a nicotine addition\" by banning those born after 2008 from buying tobacco products would also be included in the new laws.\nThe ban mirrors proposals in the UK that are currently on hold due to the general election, which would ban anyone born after 2009 from purchasing the items.\nMr Crookall said while there would \"likely be many long-term savings on health care\" but there would also \"likely be short term financial implications, with wider issues around point of purchase identification, and duties and wider taxation\".\nHis concerns were echoed by Chief Minster Alfred Cannan who said the moves could \"inadvertently create a black market\" and the island could be seen as \"being an outlier\" on the issue.\nDr Haywood said the proposed new legislation would address a \"number of gaps\" in current laws and could be \"one of the biggest advancements in public health for a very long time\". \nThe government could lose \"around \u00a3300,000 in tobacco duty a year\" but that in \"no way covers dealing with the cost of smoking and nicotine addiction harms\", she said.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

    "Having survived the night as Hurricane Beryl tore across her idyllic home of Union Island with ferocious force, Katrina Coy was taken aback by the extent of the devastation which lay before her.\nVirtually every building on the island, which lies off St Vincent and the Grenadines, has been razed or badly damaged, she said.\n\u201cUnion Island is in a terrible state after Beryl passed. Literally, almost the whole island is homeless,\u201d said Ms Coy in a video message.\n\u201cThere are hardly any buildings left standing. Houses are flattened, roads are blocked, the electricity poles are down in the streets.\u201d\nFisherman and fishing guide Sebastien Sailly agreed. \n\u201cEverything is lost. I have nowhere to live right now,\u201d he said.\nA resident of Union since 1985, he lived through Hurricane Ivan in 2004. But Hurricane Beryl, he said, was on another level.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a tornado has passed through here. Ninety percent of the island \u2013 easily 90% \u2013 has been erased.\u201d\nThe extent of the shock and fear is still evident in his voice.\n\u201cI was sheltering with my wife and daughter and, to tell you the truth, I wasn\u2019t sure we would make it out at all.\u201d\nHis cousin, Alizee, who runs a hotel with her family, described a horrific experience as Beryl passed over their town. \nShe said they had to push furniture against the doors and windows to keep the sustained winds and huge gusts from blowing them open.\n\u201cThe pressure was so intense that you felt it in your ears. We could hear the roof coming apart and smashing into another building. Windows breaking, flooding.\u201d\n\u201cNo one knew it would be this bad, everyone is traumatised.\u201d\nAn organic farmer and beekeeper as well as a fisherman, Sebastien\u2019s two farms and his beehives have been completely destroyed as well.\nStill, he said the community\u2019s immediate priority is shelter. People have been trying to gather wood and plastic sheeting to make some kind of temporary accommodation for their families.\n\u201cAnd obviously, finding water and food is going to be tough,\u201d he added.\nAlizee Sailly said many other goods are also urgently needed on Union Island \u2013 from tinned foods and powdered milk to sanitary products, first-aid kits and tents.\nPlus, of course, generators.\nWith power and communications still down, she has only managed to send out messages by connecting to the Starlink network launched by Elon Musk's SpaceX.\nFor its part, the government in St Vincent and the Grenadines says it recognises the scale of the problem. \nIn a morning address, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves summed up the sense of the shock across the Caribbean nation: \"Hurricane Beryl \u2013 this dangerous and devastating hurricane \u2013 has come and gone and it\u2019s left in its wake immense destruction. Pain and suffering across our nation.\u201d\nHe also promised to react as quickly as possible to tackle the long list of post-hurricane priorities facing his administration.\nOn Union Island, however, there remains some scepticism that the government has the funds, resources and manpower to cope.\n\u201cI hope they can send us the military and the coastguard to help us. I have no idea if they\u2019re able to rebuild the island but I don\u2019t think so\u201d, said Sebastien. \u201cThis is going to take billions, it will take a year or more and is going to need international help.\u201d\nKatrina Coy, the director of the Union Island Environmental Alliance, also implored members of the Caribbean diaspora to help in any way they could.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in dire need of help. Emergency kits, food, evacuation, all of that is needed in this moment.\u201d\nFor years, Ms Coy has carried out crucial work for Union Island\u2019s water security, a vital resource for small island communities in the Caribbean. \nHeartbreakingly, her international colleagues say, that work has been lost to Hurricane Beryl.\nBeryl hit land on Monday as a category four hurricane, with sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h).\nThousands of people are still without power and many are in temporary shelters in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and St Lucia.\nYet despite the chaos and the homelessness across every inch of the island Sebastian Sailly said he was just thankful things weren\u2019t even worse.\n\u201cThe most important thing is that we are still alive, not the material losses.\u201d\n\u201cAfter witnessing the power of what we went through, today I was just pleased to see my neighbours were still here.\u201d",
    "A man who plotted to bomb a hospital in Leeds and an RAF base has been found guilty of preparing acts of terrorism.\nMohammad Farooq, 28, targeted St James's Hospital in January 2023 but was stopped by a member of the public.\nA trial at Sheffield Crown Court heard how the clinical support worker had planned to \"kill as many nurses as possible\" by detonating a pressure cooker bomb.\nJurors unanimously convicted Farooq, of Hetton Road in Leeds. He will be sentenced at a later date.\nFarooq was employed by the hospital at the time as a nursing assistant.\nHe was stopped from carrying out the attack by a patient who moved him away from the building, talked him down and called police.\nThe court heard how Farooq's first target was RAF Menwith Hill, a spy base near Harrogate which is operated by US and UK staff.\nWhen he thought that was not possible, jurors were told Farooq then switched to the \"softer and less well-protected target\" of St James's Hospital in the early hours of 20 January last year.\nFarooq was arrested outside the hospital with the pressure cooker bomb, which was designed to be twice as powerful as those used by the Boston Marathon bombers in 2013.\nThe court was told he had immersed himself in an \"extremist Islamic ideology\" and went to the hospital to \"seek his own martyrdom\" through a \"murderous terrorist attack\".\nProsecutor Jonathan Sandiford KC said he had a grievance against several of his former colleagues and had been conducting a poison pen campaign against them.\nMr Sandiford said Farooq's plan was to detonate the bomb, then kill as many people as possible with knives before using an imitation firearm to incite police to shoot him dead.\nThe prosecutor said \"two pieces of good fortune intervened\" to stop the planned attack.\nThe first was that a bomb threat he sent in a text message to an off-duty nurse in order to lure people to the car park where he was waiting was not seen for almost an hour, so the full-scale evacuation he had hoped for did not happen.\nMr Sandiford said Farooq left but returned shortly afterwards with a new plan to wait in a hospital cafe for a staff shift change and detonate his device.\nBut the court heard \"luck intervened again\" because a patient, Nathan Newby, was standing outside the hospital having a cigarette and \"noticed the defendant\".\nHe said: \"Mr Newby realised something was amiss and began to talk to him instead of walking away.\n\"That simple act of kindness almost certainly saved many lives that night because, as the defendant was later to tell the police officers who arrested him, Mr Newby succeeded in 'talking him down'.\"\nAn investigation found he had become self-radicalised through accessing extremist material online, and had obtained bomb-making instructions in a magazine published by Al Qaeda to encourage lone wolf terrorist attacks against the West.\nMovements of Farooq's mobile phone and car showed he made at least two visits to the area of Menwith Hill in the 10 days leading up to his arrest, jurors were told.\nMr Sandiford said the base had been designated as a target by IS because it was believed it had been used to co-ordinate drone strikes against terrorists.\nFarooq admitted firearms offences, possessing an explosive substance with intent and having a document likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.\nCounter terrorism police described Farooq as an \"extremely dangerous individual\".\nDet Supt Paul Greenwood, Head of Investigations for Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said the defendant was  \"primarily motivated by a Daesh-inspired ideology, but also by his own, deep-seated grievances\".\nHe added: \u201cWe are sincerely grateful for the actions of Nathan Newby that morning, whose bravery and willingness to calm Farooq prevented him from fully realising his plans. \n\"Had he not intervened the outcome could have been devastating.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter), and\u00a0Instagram.

Hamas and the hospital administration denied this.\nA number of Israeli ministers and politicians have denounced his release.\nAs he was released, Dr Abu Salmiya alleged that some medical staff detained by Israel had died in prison of torture.\nIn April, Dr Adnan al-Bursh - who was head of orthopaedics at al-Shifa hospital - is reported to have died in detention.\nDr Abu Salmiya also said that Palestinian prisoners were facing verbal and physical humiliation, as well as a lack of food and water.\n\"We were subjected to severe torture, and my little finger was broken. I was repeatedly subjected to being hit on the head, causing bleeding many times,\" he alleged.\n\"There was almost daily torture in the Israeli prisons. When prisoners' cells were raided, they were severely beaten every day.\"\nSimilar allegations of mistreatment have been made by some of the thousands of Palestinians detained since war erupted between Israel and Hamas.\nThe Israeli prison service told the BBC it was not aware of the claims by Dr Abu Salmiya, but said that all prisoners are detained according to the law and prisoners had the right to file a complaint.\nIn Israel, several ministers and leading politicians have expressed outrage at Dr Abu Salmiya's release.\nThe former war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, said a government that freed suspects accused of sheltering those responsible for the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October should resign.\nThe far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has called for the head of the Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, to be dismissed.\nFor its part, Shin Bet has issued a statement saying that overcrowding in Israeli jails is forcing the release of detainees such as Dr Abu Salmiya.\nIt added that he met all the requirements for release with regard to the threat he might pose - but said it would investigate the decision to free him.",
    "Authorities in Coventry have said they will review their policies for a popular festival following reports of stampeding youths at this year\u2019s event.\nPeople took to social media after the Godiva Festival to discuss various incidents, including one which they said caused a festival stage to close down.\nSeveral people commented to say they had never seen anything like it before and claimed the incident involved more than 100 youngsters.\nThe council, which organises the event, said safety is their main priority and added that they review feedback after each event.\nThe festival, which marked its 25th year, was held at War Memorial Park from 5 to 7 July.\nSome said the incidents had forced them to leave early and put them off returning.\nOthers, however, said they had had a good time, describing it as amazing and brilliant.\nIt is not the first time there have been reports of trouble at the festival.\nLast year, similar concerns were raised about gangs of youths, and a crush in 2019 led to 11 people being treated for minor injuries.\nIn 2017 a 16-year-old was arrested for carrying a knife at the festival.\nRichard Ashcroft, Paloma Faith and Beverley Knight were among this year's perfomers.\nA spokesperson for Coventry City Council said organisers review all feedback, including social media comments, and this is used to make decisions for future events.\nThey said they had worked with a security contractor, West Midlands Police and other organisations, adding that the safety of attendees is their main priority and the entire site is under observation at all times.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to reassure attendees that Godiva Festival is a safe environment for festivalgoers of all ages,\u201d they said.\nThey added: \u201cWe are determined to ensure the festival is accessible, appealing and safe for everyone.\u201d\nThey apologised to those who were impacted by negative behaviour, and said they would work to ensure the small minority do not spoil it for others.\nThis news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "With a central statue dedicated to Queen Victoria in its grounds, Belfast City Hall holds many symbols of British and unionist culture.\nBut recently added to the front lawns are two statues honouring women revered within Irish republicanism.\nFor some, the inclusion of Mary Ann McCracken and Winifred Carney reflects a changing Northern Ireland.\nAnd the UK general election results here may also mirror that change.\nSinn F\u00e9in is now Northern Ireland\u2019s largest party at Westminster level - completing a historic hat-trick for Irish nationalism.\nThe party already became the largest in the devolved assembly at Stormont in 2022 and at local council level in 2023.\nSo how has Sinn F\u00e9in achieved this success? And what does it mean for the future of Northern Ireland?\nNationalist political commentator Chris Donnelly, a former Sinn F\u00e9\u00edn election candidate, said the party has \u201cundoubtedly benefited\u201d from divisions within unionism.\nFor years the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has faced internal battles and pressure from smaller rivals over its handling of Brexit.\nIn this election the party fell to second place in Northern Ireland with five seats after losing three.\nThe DUP has been the \"lead voice of unionism\" for decades but has \"corralled unionism into a cul de sac\", Mr Donnelly said.\n\u201cSo much so that in former unionist heartlands like North Down, East Belfast and Lagan Valley, these are now marginals with the Alliance Party - something that no one would have thought would have happened 25 years ago.\u201d\nIn Thursday\u2019s poll, DUP leader Gavin Robinson held on to his East Belfast seat, but the party did not stand in North Down and it lost the Lagan Valley seat it had held for the last 20 years to Alliance.\nSinn F\u00e9in has meanwhile been moving its politics \"more into the centre and yielding the dividends\u201d.\nMr Donnelly said the party is viewed as \"more progressive, more forward-looking\" with an election campaign of \"unrelenting positivity\".\nAt the Ulster Museum in the south of the city, tourists visit an exhibition on the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\nIts display cabinets contain many reminders of the decades-long violent conflict from all sides, including the role of the IRA.\nIn this election Sinn F\u00e9in continued to face questions over its past links to the republican paramilitary organisation.\nStormont\u2019s First Minister Michelle O\u2019Neill, deputy leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, was noncommittal\u00a0when asked if she would attend IRA commemorations in future.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in has changed significantly in the years since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement brought relative peace.\nMarie Coleman, a professor of 20th century Irish history at Queen's University Belfast, said a younger generation is coming to the fore of the party.\n\"We see a generation of politicians born after the conflict, so with no involvement in the conflict,\" she said.\nThe academic added the \"peace dividend is playing out in electoral politics\".\nSinn F\u00e9in does not take its seats at Westminster due to the party\u2019s policy of abstentionism.\nProf Coleman said there are no signs that stance will be reversed, and not only because of the oath of allegiance to the monarch that MPs must recite.\nShe said even if the UK \"declared itself as a republic in the morning\", the policy \"wouldn't change\".\n\"The bottom line is that Sinn F\u00e9in does not accept the right of the Westminster parliament to rule Northern Ireland,\" she said.\nWhile Sinn F\u00e9in's vote share increased compared to the last Westminster election in 2019, its share was down slightly on recent assembly and council elections.\nIt follows local and European elections in the Irish Republic last month in which the party did not make the major advances that many opinion polls had predicted.\nAont\u00fa leader Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn, a former Sinn F\u00e9in TD, said the party had \"flip-flopped\" on some policy areas including immigration.\n\u201cIf you flip-flop too much, your credibility goes. If you have no credibility, then there's a difficulty for that party retaining support,\u201d he said.\nMr T\u00f3ib\u00edn said that with Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing government back in business since February, Sinn F\u00e9in could have difficulties.\n\"Sinn F\u00e9in have sold themselves as an anti-establishment party,\" he said.\n\"But in reality now that they have the position of First Minister, now that they are immersed in the administration of the north of Ireland, they can't ride those two horses at the same time.\"\nHe said that as Stormont \"normalises\" and \"becomes more focused on the bread-and-butter issues, it's going to be very difficult for Sinn F\u00e9in to hold that level of support\".\nThe electoral rise of Sinn F\u00e9in will inevitably lead to debate over any prospect of Irish unity - Northern Ireland leaving the UK to join with the Republic of Ireland.\nDuring the election campaign, senior party figures attended a major rally in Belfast organised by a group lobbying for a united Ireland.\nMr Donnelly argued Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s growth has forced other parties in the Republic to \u201cbecome more serious\u201d about the idea.\n\u201cAnd t",
    "An Australian father has been charged with murdering three of his children and attempting to kill the rest of his family in a house fire.\nA five-month-old girl, a two-year-old boy and a six-year-old boy died in the blaze. Three boys and a girl - aged between four and 11 - survived, along with their mother.\nThe 28-year-old man is facing three counts of murder, five counts of attempted murder and one charge of destroying property with the intent to endanger life. He remains in hospital under police guard.\nThe fire has horrified the country and comes at a time when Australia's government has declared domestic and family violence a \"national crisis\".\nThe father - who police allege started the inferno in the early hours of Sunday morning and then blocked rescue attempts - was represented by his lawyer in a local Sydney court on Thursday and did not apply for bail.\nSpeaking to media afterwards, New South Wales Det Supt Daniel Doherty said the incident is \"one of the worst cases of filicide\" - which is when a parent intentionally kills their children - to take place in the state.\nHe said police will allege the father lit fires throughout the house with the use of an \"accelerant\u201d such as petrol, and then locked all the doors inside to prevent his family from escaping.\nThey also intend to argue that he disrupted rescue efforts by concerned neighbours and first responders who helped the four surviving children and their mother from the burning house. \nIn one instance, Det Supt Doherty said the man was \u201cholding on to\u201d one of the children as he tried to escape, which meant first responders had to \u201cwrestle the boy from his grasp\u201d.\nThe five-month-old baby girl was found by paramedics, already deceased. The two- and six-year-old boys made it out of the house in a critical condition but died in hospital a short time later.\nPolice have commended the residents who assisted the family for their bravery, including Jarrod Hawkins, a man living across the road who pulled three of the children from the flames.\nThe mother has been released from hospital and police say her four surviving children are all in a stable condition.",
    "The story of a Truro man killed in Ukraine after rescuing hundreds of people from the front line has been turned into a documentary.\nThe BBC film Hell Jumper features the work of 28-year-old Chris Parry, who went to the country shortly after it was invaded by Russia more than two years ago.\nMr Parry died from gunshot wounds alongside fellow volunteer Andrew Bagshaw in January 2023.\nThe film, documenting Mr Parry's actions, has just had its premiere for family and friends at Truro's Plaza Cinema, and is due to be shown on BBC2 on 24 July, as well as being available on the BBC iPlayer.\nThe term \"hell jumper\" refers to those who go into the Ukrainian warzone to bring people out to safety.\nMr Parry helped rescue more than 400 people before being shot by Russian mercenaries.\nMuch of his work is captured on 10 hours of bodycam footage, which makes up a large part of the film.\nDirector Paddy Wivell said he developed a huge respect for Mr Parry and his actions after studying the recordings.\nHe said: \"It was in those pieces that I felt extraordinary admiration for him and thinking I could not do that, I am not brave in that way.\n\"I came to understand that he would not stop until he found the people he was going to evacuate.\n\"So, I really wanted to honour that process in the film and keep that section of the film quite long so the audience felt they were truly immersed in his experience, and in the danger that he was confronting.\"\nOne of Chris Parry's closest friends, Freya Osborne, was among those in the audience at the premiere screening and appears in the film.\nShe said: \"In a really bizarre way, it was actually really lovely.\n\"I think a little boy from Truro, saving all those lives and putting himself in danger - it's incredible that there's such light in such horribleness.\"\nThe film was produced by Adriana Tymco, who heard of Mr Parry's story and knew it needed to be told to a wider audience.\nShe said: \"I found him so incredibly endearing as a person.\n\"He said: 'I'm a man with a van and I want to help in any way I can.'\n\"He told me about his year in Ukraine - he was full of energy, so full of drive and so full of purpose, and said the war had completely changed him as a person - all the horrors he had seen.\n\"He started sending me footage and said: 'If anything ever happens to me, I would like my family to have something of me.'\n\"I never ever thought that this would come true.\n\"It gives me goose bumps now, but I made him a promise.\"\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Under the shade of a leafy green apricot tree on a scorching summer afternoon, Gokcen Yildiz scoops up a squirming ball of light-brown fur.\nIt licks her all over the face and she breaks out in giggles. \nBut laughter gives way to a more serious tone as she points to the dog's back legs, which are missing paws. A sign, she says, of the abuse some of Turkey\u2019s street dogs are subjected to.\nMs Yildiz is a secondary school physics teacher by day, street-dog advocate by night. The canine she\u2019s holding is one of 160 she\u2019s collected on the property where she lives on the outskirts of Turkey\u2019s capital city, Ankara.\nHer dogs are a small fraction of the estimated four million that make up the country\u2019s street-dog population.\nIt\u2019s a problem that has fiercely divided public opinion: are stray dogs a neighbourhood fixture to be looked after and loved? \nOr does the government need to take more drastic solutions, like those state media are reporting that it's considering - including euthanasia?\nOn her 15,000 sq m property, Ms Yildiz looks after elderly and disabled dogs, and those with psychological or behavioural issues.\n\u201cIt is not my job, but I look after dogs in need,\u201d she said. \u201cI always experience financial worry because the economy is getting harder. When the price of petrol increases, everything like pet food or the medicine I give, or the vet expenses - everything goes up.\u201d\nShe said she feels anxious about finances, but her bigger concern is what will happen to the dogs if she doesn\u2019t collect them.\n\u201cThe dogs outside of here eat every two or three days, but they\u2019re alive. They\u2019re not about to die. That\u2019s what really worries me,\u201d she said.\nLawmakers from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party (AKP) are working on a new bill aimed at getting dogs off the streets.\nIt hasn\u2019t yet been introduced into the country\u2019s parliament, but state media report it could require municipalities to collect stray dogs, shelter them for around 30 days, and if the animals are not adopted in that time, euthanise them.\nThe latter provision has outraged animal rights activists - and Turkey\u2019s dog lovers, like Ms Yildiz - but it\u2019s also raised questions about whether existing facilities across the country could handle additional responsibilities.\nOnly about one third of the nation\u2019s provincial and district municipalities have shelters, according to Doctor Murat Arslan, president of the Turkish Veterinary Medical Association.\nHe said this had been one of the problems with an existing law, which requires dogs to be sterilised and then returned to the streets where they lived.\n\u201cIn order to manage the animal population, street dogs needed to be collected, sterilised, given some vaccinations, and then released back to the street. However, not every municipality had shelters or facilities where these operations could be carried out. Especially in small municipalities, there are neither shelters nor sufficient employment of veterinarians.\u201d\nIf this law, enacted 20 years ago, had been enforced, the street-dog population wouldn\u2019t be so large today, Dr Arslan said.\nAnimal abandonment and overbreeding and selling of dogs had also allowed the street-dog population to rise, he told the BBC. Although animals are microchipped and registered in a centralised database, officials needed to be better at following through with fines for owners when animals were found to have been thrown out on the street, he added.\nRegardless of what led to the problem, campaign groups like Safe Streets Association argue a solution is needed to take dogs permanently off the street.\nAttorney Meltem Zorba is a volunteer for Safe Streets. She works with families that have been victims of stray-dog attacks, and points to government statistics that show over the past five years, street dogs have contributed to 55 deaths, more than 5,000 injuries, and 3,500 traffic accidents.\n\u201cWe have been pressuring for legal change for three years,\u201d she said. \u201cThere should not be stray dogs on the streets. These attacks on people causing death, traffic accidents, and other animals being attacked are unacceptable.\u201d\nShe\u2019s calling for a legal requirement to take dogs off the streets for good - rather than the catch-and-release protocol in place now. Ms Zorba also says the dogs pose other concerns including rabies and public health issues arising from dog faeces in public places, such as parks and playgrounds.\n\u201cThis is rationality,\u201d she said of the creation of new legislation, adding that euthanasia should be a last resort and a result of an animal being deemed too sick or posing a risk to society.\nThat\u2019s where a national consensus seems to be building. A recent opinion poll showed nearly 80% of respondents supported measures to take dogs off the street and provide shelter. But less than 3% believed collected dogs should be euthanised.\nBoth Ms Zorba and Ms Yildiz support a government solution that would allow dogs to be taken off the streets, collected in newly-built shelters around t",
    "When England run out to face Switzerland, they will do so carrying the hopes of a fair few fans who will have had a flutter on the outcome.\nBut if a Harry Kane hat-trick or a Declan Rice double wins anyone a small fortune, the likelihood of them founding their own bookies on the back of their win is a long shot, unless they have the sort of drive that Fred Done had when he had a similar slice of good fortune.\nNow at the head of bookmaking empire, the Salford billionaire\u2019s first shop was bought with the proceeds of \u201ca bet from the heart rather than the head\u201d on England to win the 1966 World Cup.\n\"I fancied England, so I put \u00a325 on them at 8-1 and I won \u00a3200,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBack then, a man's wage was \u00a320 a week so I used my winnings to help buy my first shop in Broughton,\u201d he said.\nHe said that while it was luck \u2013 and England\u2019s talent \u2013 that got him started, it was his own hard work and ability to see an opportunity that made him successful.\n\u201cWithin nine months, I'd doubled the turnover of the shop,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA short time later, foot and mouth disease kicked-in, so horse racing stopped - but I decided to stay open for afternoon dog racing.\n\u201cMy shop was full - it was absolutely rammed.\n\u201cThat was a lesson for me.\u201d\nThe son of an \u201cillegal bookmaker\u201d, who ran books before betting shops were legalised in 1961, he grew up in Ordsall, a stone\u2019s throw from the docks which later be reinvented as MediaCityUK, and said he had \u201ca great, happy childhood\u201d.\n\u201cEverybody was poor, but nobody felt poor because it was a working class community,\u201d he said.\n\"During the war, my dad worked at Trafford Park and would go around the factories, picking up bets.\n\u201cOne week, we'd be flushed and we'd be going to Blackpool, the next week, he'd be pawning his suit because he'd have no dough.\n\u201cBut he was a smashing man. He knew his figures. He was a very generous man and he was very popular with punters.\u201d\nDone\u2019s own business, now known as BetFred, has proved a little more popular to say the least.\nThe company operates about 1,350 betting shops and had a reported turnover of \u00a3723m in 2021/22.\nHe admitted that while that was great to see, he almost missed out on gambling\u2019s biggest money-spinner in recent years \u2013 the internet.\n\u201cI wasn't very good at the online business,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI didn't believe it would work.\n\u201cMy excuse was my age - but we eventually got into it.\n\u201cYou've got to adapt and I quickly learnt on it\".\nHe said the other big moment was when he changed the name of the firm.\n\u201cIf you put Done Brothers on a football shirt, what does that mean?\n\u201cBut the word Betfred tells you what we do.\n\u201cThe difficult thing was telling my brother [and co-founder] Peter - but he said to me \u2018get on with it, it\u2019s a great idea\u2019.\n\u201cHe was really behind it and it put us on the map.\u201d\nThe success of his business has also given Done opportunities that he never would have dreamed of when growing up, not least of which was getting the chance to buy into his beloved football team.\n\u201cForty years ago, a solicitor phoned me up and asked me if I'd like to buy a quarter of Manchester United for \u00a3250,000,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe said \u2018I've got a client who needs cash\u2019, but he never told me who the client was.\n\u201cAt the time, I had to turn it down because in those days, football clubs weren't good investments, they were a rich man's toy and I wanted to invest in Betfred.\n\u201cI regret the decision to not by a stake in the club but it was the correct decision, that's all you can say.\u201d\nOne regret he has never had is staying in Salford, as despite his success, he\u2019s never considered leaving the city for the sort of destination many with his wealth head for, such as Monaco, or as he dryly described it with reference to the Manchester area which includes one of the largest housing estates in Europe, \u201cWythenshawe with sea\u201d.\n\u201cI went there once [and] I lasted two hours in the place,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt was boring.\n\u201cPeople just want to tell you where they're going have their dinner and where they're going to buy their clothes.\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a more miserable life.\u201d\nNow in his 80s, Done still gets up at 05:00 to make the best of the day ahead.\nHe remains Betfred\u2019s chairman but now spends much of his time with his property firm Salboy or working with one of the charities he supports.\n\"At some stage in your life, you've got to give something back,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAbout seven or eight years ago, [fellow businessman] Dave Whelan asked me to go and see his youth club in Wigan.\n\u201cMy idea of a youth club was a snooker table and a table tennis table [but] there were 9,000 kids in Wigan.\u201d\nHe said he was so impressed by it, that he \u201ceventually\u201d put \u00a36m into the Hideout Youth Zone in Gorton.\n\u201cThe kids there are so respectful and I love talking to them,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI'm now working on one in Salford and its bigger than the one in Gorton.\u201d\nHowever, he said bookmaking was his first love and added that while there had been criticism of gambling and the weight it can place on individuals, he believed it was better to have firms like",
    "It was the moment when millions of football fans held their breath.\nEngland's place in the Euro 2024 semi-finals had come down to a penalty shootout against Switzerland. \nPeople watched at home, in pubs and in... London's Old Vic Theatre. \nJames Corden's play, The Constituent, was due to start at the same time last night as the penalties. \nBut instead of ploughing on with the show, Corden went on stage and watched the sporting drama with the audience and his fellow cast members. \nVideos show him kneeling down, watching the game on his tablet and talking the crowd through each kick of the ball. \nThe play, which is a political drama about an MP, started after England's dramatic victory.\nThe cast, which also includes Motherland star Anna Maxwell-Martin and Zachary Hart, had originally been watching the match backstage. \nCorden told The Guardian: \u201cWhen it got to extra time, we put on our costumes. \n\"The extra time finished about three minutes before the play was due to begin.

    "A production company says it felt like \"the stars aligned\" when it signed a contract to work with Sesame Street.\nBristol's A Productions, based on Colston Street in the city, has been working with the legendary, educational children's TV show for seven years.\nRecently, A Productions created a series of videos about children's emotional wellbeing, featuring well-known characters from Sesame Street.\nManaging director Katherine McQueen said it is \"lovely\" to work in children's TV, and feels \"so lucky\" to be working with Sesame Street.\nA Productions was created in 1986, and was asked to pitch to Sesame Street after the show came across its other productions.\nOther children's TV programmes worked on by A Productions include 2000s favourite The Tweenies, Pip and Posy, and Jo Jo and Gran Gran - the latter of which was the first animated show centred around a Black British family.\nSpeaking about working in children's television, Ms McQueen told BBC Radio Bristol: \"It's lovely, it's brilliant.\n\"When my kids were little, I had an audience, and they told me what they liked and didn't like.\n\"We were creating shows that you would see in the playground and kids had the toy, so you could get immediate feedback and know what you were doing was stuff children were really enjoying.\"\nThe new series of shorts created by A Productions for Sesame Street focus on equipping children with ways of dealing with their own emotional wellbeing.\n\"It can be anything from breakdowns at bedtime to making sure you eat the right food and Bert and Ernie telling you to take deep breaths if you're feeling nervous,\" said Ms McQueen.\n\"It's a great way in engaging kids in dealing with their own feelings and equipping them with ways of dealing with their emotions.\"\nSesame Street first hit American airwaves in 1969, making its way across the pond two years later.\nSomething of US television institution, \"educational consultants and doctors\" lend expertise to script writers and members of the production crew to \"make sure you're saying things the right way\", Ms McQueen said.\nSesame Street is filmed in the New York City borough of Queens, with Ms McQueen given \"the huge privilege\" of walking the legendary street before the pandemic hit.\n\"I have been on Sesame Street and seen all the puppets doing their thing, and stood under the sign,\" she said, adding she met Big Bird, Elmo, Grover, and Abby Cadabby on set.\n\"We look forward to going out there again - it\u2019s such a treat.\n\"There are quite a few animation companies in Bristol and, of course, we\u2019ve got Aardman leading the way but there are so many other studios.\n\"During Covid, I think we were employing 170 people and a lot of those are local people, which is brilliant for us and brilliant for them.\" \nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Paralympic athlete Richard Whitehead faces a wait to find out if he set a new world record at the Derby Ramathon.\nWhitehead, who competes in the T61 class, was delighted to cross the line in a time of one hour 14 minutes 38 seconds.\nIf the record is ratified by the World Para Athletics organisation, it will see Nottingham-based Whitehead regain the half marathon record, 14 years after he last set the world\u2019s best time.\nHis previous record was about 21 seconds slower than Sunday\u2019s time.\nHe told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019ve been training quite hard over the last 18 months towards my aspirational goal in the marathon.\n\"I\u2019ve been looking for events that fit my training routine and obviously the race on Sunday was a chance to show what my form and fitness levels are.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that athletes like myself don\u2019t just compete in the big London and regional races, I\u2019m passionate about the East Midlands and have lots of friends in Derby.\"\nThe T61 class is for athletes with a double leg amputation above the knee.\nWhitehead said it was the first time he had taken part in the Ramathon but had \"heard lots about it\".\n\"It was very well organised and very accommodating,\" he said.\n\u201cAs a person with a disability, hopefully I proved to those on the other side of the railings that running is for everybody, it\u2019s about taking that first positive step.\n\u201cIf you look at where running is as a sport, it\u2019s more mainstream now and not just for people that are fanatical about it and the Ramathon has embraced that.\u201d\nA spokesman for the International Paralympic Committee said: \u201cWorld records are subject to ratification by World Para Athletics.\n\u201cThis process may vary due to a series of factors, including the proximity with major events such as the Paralympic Games.\u201d\nThe ninth annual Ramathon event attracted 1,690 entrants ranging from elite athletes like Whitehead to casual runners taking on a shorter 8k route.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The sight of hundreds of people doing a workout with fitness guru Joe Wicks, aka the Body Coach, may have given regular Glastonbury festival goers pause.\nTimes appear to be a'changing, as Bob Dylan could have sung at the iconic Isle of Wight festival in 1969 (but apparently didn't).\nNever mind (sex), drugs and rock'n'roll. At festivals across the land, more and more fitness and well-being areas are appearing, as organisers get on board with the changing zeitgeist.\nAnd one festival, held in an area of outstanding natural beauty no less, has put fitness on level pegging with music.\nLove Trails, taking place on Gower, Swansea, this week, offers punters a mash-up of running events alongside music acts to be found on the regular festival circuit.\nThe idea for combining the two came from co-founder Theo Larn-Jones, whose mother was brought up in Mumbles and who now lives locally himself.\nBack in 2015, he was a keen runner living in London and and had got involved with a group called Midnight Runners.\nInstead of going for a traditional night out down the pub or club, the group would meet, complete with speakers, and go for a run interspersed with exercise stops to a pumping soundtrack. Some runs would be followed by a more traditional party night as well.\nBut he also loved music festivals.\nSo it was a \u201cbringing together of those two worlds which at the time were very much in two separate buckets\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cMe and the co-founder of Love Trails were running along and we just thought, this is amazing for being a place where we can meet like-minded people where we can do the running and we can do the going out on a Friday night.\n\"The next logical extension of this is to turn this into a festival \u2013 could that even be possible?\u201d\nThe first year was initially for people who were really into running, and really into music \u201cso it was quite a small niche\u201d, but over time it has become a much broader audience, he says.\nTheo stresses that equal weight is given to both sides of the festival. \u201cWe put the music and the running on the same level of programming.\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of other music festivals out there that programme incredible line-ups of music and there\u2019s also thousands and thousands of running events that put on incredible experiences within the worlds of running.\n\"But it\u2019s only at Love Trails at the moment where you can go and listen to a band or DJ that would have played at Glastonbury last week. No running events do that.\n\u201cA lot of festivals these days would have a wellness field or give a little nod to it but we really just crank it up to 10 on both the music and the running.\n\u201cI definitely think the world is changing, and I think it\u2019s a really positive shift. There\u2019s lots of signals that we\u2019re seeing across the UK festival industry that other festivals are looking at what events like Love Trails are doing and wanting to incorporate some of that into their programme.\u201d\nGlastonbury Festival was unavailable to comment on whether exercise and fitness is becoming more important to it in the light of Joe Wicks' session, citing a well-earned break for staff after this year's event.\nBut Theo points to things like the Bristol-based group Ravers to Runners doing a tour of festivals including Glastonbury and Latitude as well as Love Trails itself this summer and bringing a run to each of them.\nHis former group Midnight Runners are also offering a run at the Wilderness festival, which heavily advertises its well-being offering.\n\u201cMost festivals are dialling up the well-being offering. I think people are realising it feels really good to feel good. Hangovers just aren\u2019t so fun and you can have the best of both worlds these days.\n\u201cTrail running is the best type of exercise you can do for your body and your mental health and you do it in a green space, so you get all the benefits of being in nature layered on top of the exercise benefits of doing the running.\u201d\nPart of it is changing attitudes among the younger crowd.\n\"You see this with the next generation coming through - less drinking, it's cool to be healthy,\" he says.\n\"People have got much greater awareness of their mental and physical health and they want to do things that feel good.\"\nThe festival has withstood the covid years and has aspirations to keep growing, and maybe even branch out to other sites.\nAnd with Joe Wicks reportedly eyeing the main Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury for his fitness session next year, it seems a healthier version of hedonism is very firmly here to stay.",
    "Children at a girls' school in south-east London have unveiled a mural there to commemorate the life of Stephen Lawrence. \nHe was 18 when he was murdered in April 1993 in a racist attack in Eltham.\nPupils in Year 9 and 10 at Eltham Hill School painted the mural in sections every week over most of the past academic year.\nStephen's mother Baroness Lawrence, who unveiled the mural, said she was \"really and truly moved\".\nBaroness Lawrence said she \"often wondered\" what would her son would say if he \"knew about his name being so well known\".\nSpeaking to the students, she said: \"I don\u2019t think he\u2019d realise how much his contribution has been to this country and to this society.\u201d\nDuring her speech, Baroness Lawrence spoke about her ongoing fight for justice for her son: \u201cUs as a family, we are the ones who had to fight for justice \u2013 it didn\u2019t come \u2013 it didn\u2019t come to us.\n\u201cAnd you can see what\u2019s happening today with our young people - it\u2019s the families yet again who have to raise their voices to get some justice.\n\u201cI want to make sure now that we hold the government to account to make sure young lives do matter and that we protect them every way that we can.\"\nHafsah was one of more than a dozen students who worked on the project.\nShe told BBC London that the mural was important in reminding people of the teenager's story. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we educate young people for more generations going,\u201d she said.\nJamila, who painted the skyline on the mural, told BBC London: \u201cWe added the skyline because Stephen wanted to be an architect when he grew up and we added it in a blue colour, to show it that was a blueprint because a few of these buildings hadn\u2019t been made yet before he passed away.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWe wanted to draw attention to, like, he was a person and he did want to grow up and have an occupation \u2013 and he was passionate about art.\u201c\nThe students explained why they included the quote at the top of the mural: \"You don\u2019t have to be afraid of what you are\".\nIt comes from the song Hero by Mariah Carey, one of Stephen's favourite artists, and was released in 1993, the year he was killed.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Israeli military has told all residents of Gaza City to evacuate south to the central Gaza Strip, amid intensified operations in the north. \nLeaflets dropped by aircraft instruct \"everyone in Gaza City\" to leave what is described as a \"dangerous combat zone\" via designated safe routes - marked as two roads that lead to shelters in Deir al-Balah and al-Zawaida.\nThe UN has said it is deeply concerned about evacuation orders being given. It is the second time since the war began that Gaza City as a whole has been asked to evacuate.\nOver the past two weeks, Israeli forces have re-entered several districts where the military believes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters have regrouped since the start of the year.\nHamas has said Israel\u2019s renewed activity in the city is threatening to derail negotiations over a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal, which resumed on Wednesday in Qatar. The talks are being attended by the intelligence chiefs of Egypt, the US and Israel, as well as the prime minister of Qatar.\nTop Hamas official Hossam Badran told AFP that Israel \"is trying to pressure negotiations by intensifying bombing operations, displacement, and committing massacres\".\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasised Israel\u2019s commitment to a deal as long as its \u201cred lines are preserved\u201d.\nThere are estimated to be more than a quarter-of-a-million people still living in Gaza City.\nSome were observed evacuating to the south after the Israeli military dropped leaflets there urging them to leave, which an Israel official later told the BBC was a recommendation rather than an instruction.\nOthers, though, were not willing to leave.\n\"I will not leave Gaza [City]. I will not make the stupid mistake that others have made. Israeli missiles do not differentiate between north and south,\u201d resident Ibrahim al-Barbari, 47, told the BBC. \n\u201cIf death is my fate and the fate of my children, we will die with honour and dignity in our homes,\u201d he said.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said it had received calls from some residents who were unable to leave their homes because of the intensity of the bombing.\n\"The information coming from Gaza City shows residents are living through tragic conditions. [Israeli] occupation forces continue to hit residential districts, and displace people from their homes and refuge shelters,\" it said. \nIn a statement issued earlier on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops had  \"conducted a counterterrorism operation\" overnight against Hamas and PIJ fighters who were operating inside a headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza City. \nThe troops had opened a \u201cdefined corridor to facilitate the evacuation of civilians\u201d from the area before they entered the structure and \u201celiminated terrorists in close-quarters combat\u201d, it added.\nThere was no immediate comment from Unrwa.\nThe IDF also said it had killed dozens of fighters in Gaza City's eastern Shejaiya district and dismantled an underground tunnel route over the past day.   \nSpeaking in the Israeli parliament on Wednesday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that 60% of Hamas fighters had been killed or wounded since Israel\u2019s offensive began. The BBC could not independently verify these figures.\nOn Tuesday, the UN Human Rights Office said it was \"appalled\" by IDF orders for residents to evacuate to \"areas where Israeli military operations are ongoing and where civilians continue to be killed and injured\".\nIt also warned that the Deir al-Balah area was already seriously overcrowded with Palestinians displaced from other areas of Gaza and that there was little infrastructure and limited access to humanitarian assistance. \nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy the Hamas group in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 38,295 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but it had reportedly identified 14,680 children, women and elderly people among the dead by the end of April.",
    "Events have been held to mark the 150th anniversary of the first lawn tennis-only club.\nLeamington Lawn Tennis and Squash Club said Harry Gem and friends created their own rules for the sport in the town, at a time when lawn tennis was becoming increasingly popular.\nIt contended their version of the sport at the original Leamington Lawn Tennis Club in 1874 was close to \"what you would recognise as tennis today\".\nA family fun day and a special doubles tournament have already taken place this summer.\nOn Sunday, the modern-day club was due to hold a \"Whites & Wood\" tournament, with people dressing in their own whites and using wooden rackets. \nTreasurer Dan Cale said people had looked in garages, sheds, \"tips and recycling centres\", leading to the organisation acquiring dozens of the rackets and getting a \"club coach to restring them\" for use.\nThe treasurer stated \"essentially we can reliably claim that Leamington tennis club was the first sole lawn tennis club in the world\".\n\"People were playing around with rackets in their gardens. There was a need to codify and draw up rules. \n\"[Harry] Gem and his friends in Leamington created their own rules [for tennis], which was played at the Manor House hotel in Leamington.\"\nAlthough the treasurer said the current club was not the same as the original, with those now involved being \"inheritors\" of it, he spoke about the town's history and stated \"we believe we had a big influence on what we see now as the rules of tennis\".\nHe said Henry 'Cavendish' Jones, who wrote down the rules at the All England club in 1877, had \"visited Leamington at least twice in 1874 and stayed at the Manor House hotel\".\nThere were \"bigger rectangles\" in 1874, with the entire court comprising four of them, whereas the All England club's 1877 model included tramlines for doubles and areas to serve into, as today, Mr Cale said.\nLeamington's court was 90ft x 36ft, compared to 78ft x 36ft.\nMr Cale said: \"We're very proud we have a part to play in the history of the development of this great sport.\n\"We would extend a vote of thanks to people who helped build the club into what it is today.\"\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A hospital trust in Nottinghamshire has said it is offering more virtual appointments to patients while it reviews its car parking provision.\nSherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it had been treating \"growing numbers\" of people being treated at King's Mill Hospital, in Sutton-in-Ashfield, over the past year.\nSome patients attending appointments have complained about the lack of parking spaces, describing the situation as \"dire\" and \"absolutely manic\" at peak times.\nThe trust said it was \"truly sorry\" for people's experiences, adding it was looking at ways to encourage more use of public transport.\nAll public car parks at the hospital are barrier-controlled to provide safe parking and  charge patients a fee for their stay. \nHowever, the barriers stopped working about six months ago, meaning people could park for free, and it was no longer controlled.\nThe trust said: \u201cWe have seen growing numbers of people receiving treatment at our hospitals over the past year.\n\"To help manage this, we have been exploring ways to make the best possible use of our car parks, including by offering the option of virtual appointments to patients who don\u2019t need to attend their appointments in-person.\n\u201cWhile we know that public transport won\u2019t be practical for everyone, [we have] worked with partners to install two new bus stops within the grounds of King\u2019s Mill Hospital within the past year to make this a more convenient option, and [we are] also working with local providers to explore how we can encourage the use of public transport by both our staff and patients alike.\u201d\nHospital users expressed their frustration with the parking situation.\nKing's Mill hospital is the closest for Mark Housley, 61, however, he says he does not even try the hospital car park and leaves his car at the supermarket across the road instead.\nThe 61-year-old said: \"[At peak times] it's absolutely manic, and then later in the day it becomes a little more civilised.\"\nIan Randall is a blue badge holder and said parking is \"dire\". \nHe said he was unable to find a disabled parking space for his hospital appointment, ending up being 15 minutes late and having to park in a parent and child space. \nMark Ball, 60, will park down the street and walk to the hospital when he has an appointment. \nHe said: \"It's just too busy, there's no spaces, and it's too expensive, you don't know how long you're going to be here so it could cost a fortune.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A worker who enjoyed a lavish lifestyle while embezzling more than \u00a31m from Aberdeen City Council over 17 years has been jailed.\nMichael Paterson, 59, exploited his position as a council tax and recovery team leader to keep taking the money, starting back in 2006 until last year.\nHe began stealing to pay off debts, but then started spending the money on foreign holidays, eating out and technology. He was only caught after a colleague raised suspicions about a transaction, prompting an investigation.\nFirst offender Paterson, who admitted the crime, was jailed for four years at the High Court in Edinburgh.\nPaterson's crimes took place between November 2006 and September 2023.\nHe had started working for the local authority in 1988, and rose through the ranks to become council tax and recovery team leader.\nPaterson had unsupervised authority to issue council tax refunds of up to \u00a33,000.\nHe could also alter payee account details without authorisation or verification, which he did to transfer money to himself.\nPaterson realised that he could benefit in situations where a householder had left a property and had not reclaimed for overpayment of their council tax.\nHe had started the embezzlement as he was worried about his debts.\nHowever he would instead spend the money he was stealing on foreign holidays, eating out, and technology - particularly Apple goods - as well as maintenance of his home.\nProsecutor Brian Gill KC said: \"He had just been hoping that he would not be found out.\"\nThe scam worked until a colleague noticed that a refund of more than \u00a32,000 had been made on a computer system using Paterson\u2019s username.\nShe confronted him as she thought that the account was not due a refund.\nHe told her he had been conducting tests and had accidentally put the refund through the live system instead of the test system.\nShe reported her concerns to bosses who launched a probe into Paterson\u2019s activities - and the scale of his crime emerged.\nPolice were called in, and he said: \"I know I\u2019ve done wrong. I regret what I\u2019ve done\".\nThe final total taken was \u00a31,087,444.47.\nPaterson - whose salary was \u00a335,000 a year - was still in debt at the time of his arrest.\nProceeds of Crime action against Paterson, in a bid to recover money, will be held later this year.\nDefence solicitor advocate Iain Paterson said the former council worker accepted imprisonment was inevitable.\nHe told the court: \"He is thoroughly ashamed of his actions and obviously as a consequence was dismissed from the council.\n\"He accepts what he did was totally wrong.\"\nJudge David Young KC pointed out that Paterson was able to perpetrate the crime because he was appointed to positions of trust by his employer, which he repeatedly breached over many years.\n\"This is unquestionably a serious matter and it must therefore bring serious consequences for you,\" he said.\n\"I am told you spent money on family and friends but also there was significant spending on yourself.\"\nThe judge told Paterson he would have faced a sentence of six years but for his early guilty plea.\nThe council said it was in the process of checking records and would be in touch with anyone affected with a view to reinstating any council tax credit due.\n\"The council apologises to any resident affected,\" the statement said.\n\"The council\u2019s financial controls and processes \u2013 including council tax refund arrangements \u2013 have been reviewed and strengthened.\"\nMoira Orr, who leads on homicide and major crime for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), said: \u201cThis was an egregious betrayal of trust by a council worker who took advantage of his position to embezzle public money from his employers.\"\nDet Con Tom Cameron of Police Scotland said: \u201cPaterson portrayed himself as an honest and professional individual and instead used his position to obtain a significant amount of money.\n\u201cI hope this investigation highlights our commitment to fully investigate all reports of financial crime.\n\u201cAnyone who believes they\u2019ve been a victim of a financial crime, or has information about such offences, is urged to contact Police Scotland.\"",
    "When small business owner Lewis Kemp needed to go to London to meet a client, the train seemed like the best option.\nHowever, when the 32-year-old looked at the price for the peak return journey from Manchester on 19 June, he started to wonder whether it might not be cheaper to take the client on holiday instead.\nShocked at the \u00a3339.48 cost of the journey there and back, he posted about his disbelief on social media.\nHe had no idea that more than 50,000 people would be moved by his post or that so many who were equally annoyed by the state of rail travel in Great Britain would share their frustrations.\nSo, with a general election looming, what hope can commuters hold that the situation may change in their favour in years to come?\nMr Kemp, who runs digital advertising agency Lightbulb Media, said the prices were shocking.\n\"If you need to go to London to do a pitch and take three members of staff down to do it, then you\u2019re looking at over \u00a3300 per person,\" he said.\n\"That\u2019s about a grand or so to... pitch for work that you might not get.\"\nSome who responded to his post said it could be cheaper to buy a return economy flight to New York, while others said travelling in Europe was a very different experience, where journeys of a similar distance in places like Hungary cost as little as \u00a37.\nOne said commuters were paying \"five-star prices for a one-star service\".\nRail operators have said there are a number of ways commuters can make savings.\nAvanti, which runs the West Coast mainline Mr Kemp would have used, said there were \"Superfare\" tickets which can cost \u00a320.\nIt pointed out the ticket Mr Kemp had opted for was an Anytime fare, which allows customers to travel on any train, at any time, and can be bought immediately before travel. \nA representative said most customers took advantage of \"our lower cost Advance fares\" and a single journey between Manchester and London \"starting at \u00a332\" could be found on peak-time services.\n\"We want to help people find the best value tickets for their needs,\" they said.\nSome of the commuters who responded to Mr Kemp's post said passengers should not have to \"play the system\" of planning far in advance or travelling at inconvenient times  to get cheaper fares.\nIn 2011, Sir Roy McNulty's report on rail value for money and the West Coast franchise process warned that pricing was \"extremely complex\".\nA decade later, the Department for Transport\u2019s Great British Railways plan highlighted that railways were \"too fragmented, too complicated, and too expensive to run\".\nThe plan's authors, then-Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and former Royal Mail chairman Keith Williams, said in 2023 that the Covid-19 pandemic had also had a major impact on the railways and passenger numbers. \nFor many business people like Mr Kemp though, the need to travel at a reasonable price has not gone away.\n\"The incentive to stay in this country to do business is not there,\" he said.\n\"I could go and get clients in Spain and go and see them once a week cheaper than I could go and see clients in London.\"\nThe Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have all outlined plans for the railways in their general election manifestos.\nWhile they talk of \"simpler tickets\" and an \"affordable\" system, they do not explicitly mention cheaper or capped fares in their pledges.\nThe Conservatives said they would provide \"more frequent trains, more capacity and faster journeys\".\nThey also said the Great British Railways plan would \"usher in a revitalised private-public partnership, delivering a modern and innovative railway with reliable services, and simpler tickets\".\nLabour said it would \"overhaul Britain\u2019s railways\" if elected and \"put passengers at the heart of the service by reforming the railways and bringing them into public ownership\".\nIts 142-page manifesto also mentions plans for \"a unified system that focuses on reliable, affordable, high-quality, and efficient services\".\nThe Liberal Democrats said they would ensure rail travel was a \"genuinely convenient, affordable and environmentally-friendly\" option and establish a new Railway Agency that would \"put commuters first, [hold] train companies to account and [bring] in wholesale reform of the broken fare system\".\nThey also said they would \"freeze rail fares and simplify ticketing on public transport to ensure regular users are paying fair and affordable prices\".\nOf the other parties, Reform UK said it would \"improve existing road and rail links\" across the country as part of its promise to accelerate transport infrastructure, while the Green Party has proposed bringing the railways back into public ownership.\nMichael Solomon Williams, from the Campaign For Better Transport, said the lack of clarity was not necessarily worrying.\nHe said as the Tories and Labour were committed to some form of overhaul through the Great British Railways plan, there was a likelihood progress would be made.\nHe said while rail travel in Britain was actually \"mid-table\" in terms of cost when",
    "A woman who has rescued ferrets for the last 17 years has built a new outhouse complete with slides, hammocks and a makeshift pool for the animals.\nRosie Stubbs, from Bilsthorpe in Nottinghamshire, was inspired to decorate her 35 sq ft outbuilding after seeing the cramped conditions some ferrets live in.\nThe 31-year-old runs an animal sanctuary and rescue centre, which is home to more than 40 ferrets, five pigs, two cocker spaniels and a Welsh cob pony.\nShe collects items from car boot sales and flea markets to keep the animals \"entertained\".\nMrs Stubbs has worked on the playground, which is inside an outbuilding at her home, for almost five years.\nSo far, she has collected slides, tubes, baby-bouncers, fabric for \"hammocks\" and plastic shells and containers she fills with water to make \"pools\".\nShe first \"fell in love\" with the animals when she lived on her dad's farm in Papplewick, Nottinghamshire, and kept them as pets.\nAs well as rescuing them, she breeds the Angora species of ferrets.\nShe said: \"It upsets me to see some of the conditions ferrets are kept in.\n\"Over the years, people have left them on my doorstep as other rescues are full and they don't know what to do with them.\n\"I've picked them up when they've been neglected in the woods, and sometimes they need medical attention.\"\nMrs Stubbs uses her social media pages to advertise the ferrets and find them a new home.\nShe added she wanted her space to \"accommodate as many as possible\" while they were waiting to be rehomed.\nThere are just over 40 at her home in Bilsthorpe currently and she is open to offers from those who would like to adopt one.\nMrs Stubbs says she has spent more than \u00a32,000 on her ferret playground so far.\nIn England and Wales, you do not need a licence to own the animals, but Mrs Stubbs thinks there should be \"more regulation and checks\" for people owning groups of ferrets to keep the species safe.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "US Senator Bob Menendez\u2019s defence team have told jurors the corruption case against him is \u201crotten to the core\u201d, as they wrapped up closing arguments in the high-profile trial.\nMr Menendez, 70, has pleaded not guilty to a five-year scheme of accepting gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash in exchange for political favours and aiding the governments of Egypt and Qatar.\nProsecutors told the jury in their summation on Monday that Mr Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, had sold his power for money and gold.\nJury deliberations are expected to begin on Thursday following eight weeks of trial proceedings.\n\u201cThe United States wins when thin cases brought by overzealous prosecutors are rejected,\u201d Mr Menendez\u2019s lawyer, Adam Fee, told the Manhattan court on Wednesday.\nHe argued that the gifts his client accepted do not qualify as bribes, because prosecutors have failed to prove that he took any specific action as a result.\nThe senator was merely \u201cdoing his job, and he was doing it well\u201d, said Mr Fee.\nSpeaking to reporters outside court afterwards, Mr Menendez said: \u201cWe have stripped away the government's false narratives and exposed their lies.\u201d\nIf convicted on all charges, he faces decades in prison and possible expulsion from the Democratic party.\nDuring trial, prosecutors have relied on expert testimony, emails and Mr Menendez's text messages to show what they claim is proof that the senator accepted lavish rewards from foreign governments.\nThey say the gifts included gold bars worth over $100,000 (\u00a379,000).\nMr Menendez is standing trial alongside two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, who prosecutors say sought out the senator to illegally aid the Egyptian government and secure millions of dollars from a Qatari investment fund.\nThe two have pleaded not guilty, while a third businessman, Jose Uribe, has pleaded guilty and testified against Mr Menendez in the trial.\nMr Menendez's wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, also faces charges in the bribery case, but will go on trial at a later date after the judge granted her a delay to be treated for breast cancer. She has also pleaded not guilty.\nDuring the prosecution's own closing arguments, which finished on Tuesday, federal attorney Paul Monteleoni told jurors: \u201cThis is a big case, but it all boils down to a classic case of corruption on a massive scale.\n\u201cYou don't get to be the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by being clueless,\u201d he added.\nMr Menendez was forced to step down as chairman of the influential Senate committee last year after the corruption charges against him were filed.\nThe senator has faced federal corruption charges before. He was tried in 2017, with the justice department alleging he did political favours for a wealthy Florida eye doctor in exchange for luxury holidays and other lavish gifts.\nBut that case ended in a mistrial after he was acquitted on some charges and jurors were unable to reach a unanimous verdict.",
    "China's foreign minister Wang Yi has hit back at Nato's \"groundless accusations\" that Beijing is helping Russia in its war on Ukraine.\nHe has also warned the Western alliance against stirring up confrontation.\nMr Wang's comments, made in a call with his Dutch counterpart, came hours after leaders of Nato member states gathered in Washington DC and issued a declaration that mentioned the war.\nThey accused China of being a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia through its \"large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base\", in some of their harshest remarks yet about Beijing. \nThey called on China to stop \"all material and political support\" to Russia's war effort such as the supply of dual-use materials, which are items that can be used for both civilian and military purposes.\nWestern states have previously accused Beijing of transferring drone and missile technology and satellite imagery to Moscow.  The US estimates about 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the microelectronics Russia imports now come from China.\nBeijing was also accused of conducting \"malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation\" on Nato states.\nIn a press conference on Thursday, US President Joe Biden said that he had discussions with other leaders about spelling out the consequences for China.\n\"China has to understand that if they are supplying Russia with information and capacity, working with North Korea and others to help Russia and [their] armament, that they're not going to benefit economically as a consequence of that,\" he said.\n\"I think you'll see that some of our European friends are going to be curtailing their investment in China.\"\nPointing out that Russia had been seeking weapons from China and North Korea, he added that Nato states were looking into a new policy to turn the West into an \"industrial base\" for munitions and to develop new weapons systems.\nOn Thursday, while speaking to the Netherlands' new foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp, Mr Wang said \"China absolutely does not accept\" all these accusations and insisted that they have \"always been a force for peace and force for stability\".\nIn comments carried by state media, he said that China's different political system and values \"should not be used as a reason for Nato to incite confrontation with China\", and called for Nato to \"stay within its bounds\".\nHis remarks was the latest in a flurry of angry responses from Beijing. \nEarlier on Thursday, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Nato was smearing China with \"fabricated disinformation\", while Beijing's mission to the EU told the alliance to \"stop hyping up the so-called China threat\".\nBeijing has long rebutted accusations that it has been aiding Russia in the war and insists that it remains a neutral party. It has called for an end to the conflict and proposed a peace plan, which Ukraine has rejected.\nBut, besides the growing accusations of military support, observers have also pointed out that Beijing's purchases of vast amounts of oil and gas have helped prop up Russia's economy crippled by sanctions and replenish coffers drained by war spending. \nBeijing's official rhetoric on the conflict often mirrors Moscow's - like them, China still does not call it a war. Chinese President Xi Jinping has maintained a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with both of them famously declaring their partnership has \"no limits\".\nBeijing has accused the US and other Western states of pouring \"fuel on the fire\" by supplying lethal weapons and technology to Ukraine for its defence. \nIn recent weeks, several countries have gone a step further and allowed Ukraine to use their weapons to hit targets inside Russia. \nDuring Nato's three-day summit, which ended on Thursday, the alliance continued to underscore its commitment to Ukraine. Member states said they would support Ukraine on its \"irreversible path\" to future membership, adding that \"Ukraine's future in Nato\".\nThey also announced further integration with Ukraine's military and support for its defence. The alliance has committed at least \u20ac40bn ($43.3bn, \u00a333.7bn) in aid in the next year, including F-16 fighter jets and air defence support.\n",
    "The former head of the police watchdog has told of his \"shock\" at historic sex claims, saying he stepped down from his high-profile role as it was \"the right thing to do\".\nMichael Lockwood, from Epsom, Surrey, faces 17 charges, for three rapes and 14 indecent assaults, relating to two 14-year-old girls some 40 years ago.\nAt the time, he was in his 20s and worked part-time at a leisure centre near Hull, where he allegedly met and sexually abused the girls.\nMr Lockwood went on to have a \"distinguished\" career in local government before becoming director general of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the police complaints watchdog for England and Wales.\nOne of the alleged victims, now in her 50s, came forward to claim she was repeatedly raped in a store cupboard and indecently assaulted in Mr Lockwood's Ford Capri.\nA second woman later alleged Mr Lockwood indecently assaulted her in a male toilet cubicle at the leisure centre and in the back of his mother's car after she turned 15.\nGiving evidence on Friday at the Old Bailey, Mr Lockwood told jurors how his public profile was heightened around 2021 after police officer Wayne Couzens murdered Sarah Everard and a young black man named Chris Kaba was fatally shot.\nMr Lockwood said: \"I was absolutely shocked. I did not recognise the name of the individual. Secondly, this related to events some 45 years ago.\"\nOn being interviewed about the second woman, he said he was \"particularly upset\" as they had been in a relationship.\nHe said: \"It was somebody I loved.

    "\"I still have 20 more minutes before I have to move,\" Anthony yelled from his green tent on a Hollywood sidewalk as he heard footsteps approaching.\nOfficials in Los Angeles had come by earlier to warn him that he could face arrest if he didn't move his belongings.\nThey told him about the recent Supreme Court opinion that opened the door for cities and states across the US to punish anyone sleeping outdoors \u2014 the most significant ruling on homelessness since at least the 1980s, when many experts say the modern US homeless crisis began.\nIt's added to the lengthy list of worries Anthony says he already has.\n\"I\u2019m just trying to survive,\u201d he told the BBC while lying down in his tent, using a blue backpack as a pillow.\nA black trash bag sits inside, filled with what belongings he can carry as he moves from one area to the next.\n\u201cSome nights I don\u2019t get no sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been tired all day. I just want to lay somewhere comfortable and get a good nap in. And that\u2019s it. I am not bothering nobody.\u201d\nMoments later, Anthony packed up his tent and went looking for a new place to call home.\nThe high court\u2019s ruling is already having a ripple effect on cities across the country, which have been emboldened to take harsher measures to clear out homeless camps that have grown in the aftermath of the pandemic.\nMany US cities have been wrestling with how to combat the growing crisis. The issue has been at the heart of recent election cycles on the West Coast, where officials have poured record amounts of money into creating shelters and building affordable housing.\nLeaders face mounting pressure as long-term solutions - from housing and shelters to voluntary treatment services and eviction help - take time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy and it will take a time to put into place solutions that work, so there\u2019s a little bit of political theatre going on here,\" Scout Katovich, an attorney who focuses on these issues for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told the BBC.\n\"Politicians want to be able to say they\u2019re doing something,\u201d\nThe problem, Ms Katovich and other advocates say, is arresting or fining the homeless will only worsen the problem.\n\u201cThis tactic simply kicks the can down the road. Sure, you might clean up a street but the people you arrest will surely be back.\u201d\nThe high court's ruling last week didn\u2019t mandate how cities and governments should handle homelessness - but it gave communities leeway to take more severe measures without the fear of legal recourse. \nThe case began in the small city of Grants Pass, Oregon, with a population of around 40,000. Over the last 20 years the city doubled in size, but its supply of affordable and public housing did not keep up. Housing prices skyrocketed and the number of homeless grew. \nElected leaders passed laws allowing the city to issue $295 (\u00a3230) fines - or 20-day jail sentences for repeat offenses - to unhoused people sleeping or camping in public. Three homeless people sued the city in 2018 after they received multiple citations they were unable to pay. \nAn appeals court found such laws virtually banned homelessness and amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. \nThe Supreme Court finally ruled that cities were clear to prohibit homeless people sleeping outside in public places. \n\u201cA handful of federal judges cannot begin to \u2018match\u2019 the collective wisdom the American people possess in deciding \u2018how best to handle\u2019 a pressing social question like homelessness,\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority's opinion. \nTheane Evangelis argued this case before the Supreme Court on behalf of Grants Pass. \nShe says city officials had their hands tied because they could not force anyone into a shelter. She argues those who refuse to use the services offered end up staying in encampments. \n\u201cLiving in tents is not a compassionate solution, and it's not treating people with dignity. And so the Supreme Court's decision was remarkable in the degree to which it listened to those cities,\u201d she said.\nLeaders in Grants Pass say they plan to examine the Supreme Court opinion before making a plan on whether to enforce its ban on encampments. \nThe ruling comes at a critical time for the unhoused. \nLast year, the US tracked the highest numbers of homeless people since 2007 - when the US Department of Housing and Urban Development started tracking such data.\nThere were 653,104 homeless people counted as part of the agency's yearly homeless assessment in 2023. That's a nearly 11% increase from the year prior.\nThe ACLU has been tracking the reaction to the decision by city leaders across the US. \nIt has  already sent a letter to Manchester, New Hampshire, after the mayor promised to ban encampments to \u201cmake our streets safe, clear and passable\u201d.\nOther city leaders, like the mayor in Lancaster, California, have promised to \u201cbe much more aggressive\u201d against encampments in neighbourhoods and near stores.\nMayor R Rex Parris told the Los Angeles Times \u201cwe\u2019re going to be moving them really fast\u201d.\nState lawmaker",

    "The preacher who led an overcrowded gathering in India where more than 120 people were crushed to death on Tuesday has denied blame, and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation.\nA lawyer for the self-styled guru known as Bhole Baba told the BBC the crush occurred \"due to some anti-social elements\", and blamed a \"criminal conspiracy hatched against\" his client.\nOn Thursday, police said they had arrested six people who were part of a committee that organised the event. \nNearly all those killed were women and children, who were attending the satsang - a Hindu religious festival - in Hathras district.\nThe case has sparked outrage in India and questions about a lack of security measures.\nBhole Baba - whose real name is Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari - will fully co-operate with the investigation, his lawyer AP Singh said.\nMr Singh also denied reports that security guards at the festival triggered panic by pushing away people who tried to get Bhole Baba's blessing. \n\u201cTotally false allegation,\" Mr Singh told the BBC. \"Security staff always provide help to the followers.\u201d\nThis is one of the worst crushes to happen in India for years. \nShocking images from the aftermath of the disaster have circulated online, of people driving the wounded to hospital in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even on motorbikes.\nThe crush took place in Pulrai village, where Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering.\nAn initial police report said that officials had given permission for 80,000 people to gather, but some 250,000 people turned up to the event.\nThe report says the chaos began as the preacher drove off. Eyewitnesses said people lost their footing and started falling on top of each other as hundreds rushed towards the preacher as he was leaving the venue.\nAs people ran after his vehicle, survivors said a number of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed.\nOne of the first on the scene, local resident Yogesh Yadav, told the BBC that hundreds of women ran after Bhole Baba's car as he was leaving.\n\u201cSome crossed the highway to get a better glimpse of his car. In the melee, many women fell in the drain adjacent to the highway. People started falling on top of each other,\u201d Mr Yadav said.\nThe police document added that some people tried to cross the road to a patch of mud-soaked fields, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed.\nBhole Baba was originally named Suraj Pal, but he reportedly re-christened himself as Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari. \nOne senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told BBC Hindi that the preacher had been a police constable, but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him.\nHe was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, the senior officer said.\nThe preacher has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts.\nBhole Baba is known to have an ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village.\nHis lawyer told the BBC his client is now at his ashram.

    "Samsung is hoping to lure fitness and health-tracking technology lovers with its newest wearable device - the Galaxy Ring.\nIt launched the device at its Galaxy Unpacked event on Wednesday as the latest addition to its ecosystem of devices it says it is \"supercharging\" with artificial intelligence (AI).\nSmart rings, which use tiny sensors to monitor various health metrics, have up to now been a niche product - though their recent use by the England men's football team made headlines.\nIt seems Samsung is attempting to change that, becoming the largest tech company yet to enter the smart ring market.\nBen Wood, analyst at CCS Insight, says the product choice is an \"interesting bet\" for Samsung, with his company estimating that there will be a total global market of around four million smart rings in 2025.\n\"That is a rounding error when compared with 250 million smartwatches that are also expected to be sold,\" he told the BBC.\nBut others suggest Samsung may help make smart rings more mainstream.\n\"For most consumers, the smart ring from Samsung will be the first contact they will have in the smart ring, and that top of mind awareness makes a huge difference in the long-term,\" says Francisco Jeronimo, analyst for market research firm IDC.\nJames Kitto, vice president and head of Samsung's mobile division in the UK & Ireland, heralded the ring's launch as a \"huge moment\" for the company.\nSmart rings can track health indicators such as your heart rate, sleep and menstrual cycle.\nThe market is currently dominated by Finnish health tech firm, Oura.\nIn recent years the rings have become a fitness tech fashion staple for celebrities such as Kim Kardashian.\nWith their small size and sleeker appearance, analysts say they could become the successor to smart watches like the Apple Watch and Google Pixel Watch.\nMr Kitto described Samsung's Galaxy Ring as its \"smallest and most discrete product yet, offering accurate 24/7 health, wellness and sleep tracking.\"\nSmart watches typically have more sensors than smart rings, enabling them to access and provide a wider range of health data.\nBut \"less intrusive\" smart rings can provide a convenient, comfortable and stylish alternative for those who do not want to wear a bulky smart watch, particularly overnight to track their sleep patterns, says Mr Jeronimo. \nSamsung says the device will work with Android phones operated by Android 11 or above, providing you have the Samsung Health app. Some Galaxy AI features, such as getting an Energy Score and personalised suggestions based on your data, are only available on a Galaxy device.\nDr Efpraxia Zamani, associate professor of information systems at Durham University, told the BBC that Samsung's Galaxy Ring forming part of a wider ecosystem of products providing insights into users' health and wellbeing may be an \"attractive offering\" for many consumers. \nBut she warned that users of products accessing and monitoring health data should remain wary of what data is being collected, how and where it is shared.\n\"Being part of an ecosystem, it means that data can be collected from the ring, from the watch, from the phone, and then, when put together, this can have even more negative impacts alongside the positive ones,\" she said.\nThe collecting of data relating to menstrual cycles has proven controversial in the past.\nLast year, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office launched a review of period and fertility tracking apps over data security concerns.",

    "Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has said Warsaw is considering a proposal from Kyiv to shoot down Russian missiles heading towards Polish territory while they are still in Ukrainian airspace.\nThe proposal was included in a joint defence agreement between the two countries signed during President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s visit to Warsaw earlier this week.\n\"At this stage, this is an idea. What our agreement said is we will explore this idea,\u201d Mr Sikorski told the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\nHe said some Russian missiles fired from the St Petersburg area towards Ukrainian targets near the western city of Lviv, not far from the Polish border, traversed Belarus and entered Polish airspace for about 40 seconds before turning towards their targets in Ukraine.\nMr Sikorski acknowledged that such a short time gave Poland little time to react.\nHowever the proposal would theoretically cover any missile traversing western Ukraine in the direction of Poland.\n\u201cWe are a frontline state and Russian missiles breach our airspace. We assume by mistake,\" Mr Sikorski said.\n\u201cOur dilemma is the following. If we shoot them down only when they enter our airspace the debris is a threat to our citizens and to our property. \n\"And the Ukrainians are saying, \u2018Please, we will not mind, do it over our airspace when they\u2019re in imminent danger of crossing into Polish territory. \n\"To my mind, that\u2019s self-defence but we are exploring the idea,\u201d Mr Sikorski said.\nMr Sikorski said an unarmed Russian missile landed near his home in Bydgoszcz about 500km (311 miles) from the Belarusian border, without harming anyone, in December 2022.\nTwo Polish citizens had been killed by falling debris when Ukraine shot down a Russian missile near the Polish border a month earlier.\nEarlier this week, Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would consult with its Nato allies and seek their agreement before attempting to shoot down any Russian missiles.\n\u201cIf there would be such a decision, it can only be an allied decision. It will never be an individual decision,\u201d Mr Kosiniak-Kamysz told Poland's TVN broadcaster at a Nato summit in Washington DC. \n\"The key opinion is the United States, who is quite sceptical in this matter, so Poland will certainly not make such a decision on its own,\u201d he added.\nMarek Swierczynski, a defence analyst for Polityka Insight, told the BBC the idea could prove perilous for Poland.\n\u201cWithout robust allied support, which there isn\u2019t, this proposal is very risky,\" he said.\n\"From the point of view of our air defence assets and the fact we might be subject to some kind of Russian response.\u201d\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Poland has provided Ukraine with 44 packages of weapons and ammunition, including more than 250 tanks, MiG-29 fighter jets, combat helicopters, artillery systems and portable air defence missile systems worth more than \u20ac4bn ($4.4bn; \u00a33.4bn).\nPoland plans to provide additional military assistance to Ukraine this year.",

    "Eight actors from the Equity union have filed a High Court case against casting website Spotlight, claiming it is charging unfair fees.\nSpotlight charges performers to appear in its directory, which it says was used to cast 99% of productions in the UK in 2023.\nBut Equity says the fees, which were recently increased to \u00a3216 a year for actors on a monthly tariff, are \"above what the law reasonably allows\".\nSpotlight denies that and says the union has been waging \"a campaign of deliberate misinformation\".\nJassa Ahluwalia, an actor and Equity councillor, who was among those who filed the High Court papers on Thursday, said: \"We believe that actors are essentially being exploited.\n\"They have a monopoly in the market, and we believe they're exploiting that position to overcharge.\"\nThe Equity members are asking a judge to rule on whether Spotlight is subject to a legal requirement that it cannot charge more than a \"reasonable estimate\" of the cost of producing and circulating its directory of actors.\nEquity says Spotlight's income from subscriptions has risen by more than 180% in the past seven years - but it \"seems unlikely\" that the website's costs have risen by the same amount.\n\"Back in the day, you could understand the cost, because they were producing these massive directory books that had to be printed, and there were costs associated with that,\" Ahluwalia said.\n\"But this is now a digital-only service, and they stopped producing the physical directories in 2016.\"\nMany actors struggle to afford the fees, he said.\n\"Working in the industry as somebody from a working-class background is almost impossible anyway. So to have a \u00a3200 cost as another barrier for even the chance to get into an audition room is incredibly prohibitive.\"\nSpotlight says it offers performers \"the most efficient and cost-effective means of advertising your skills and availability in the market\", and that actors are \"entirely free\" to advertise their services elsewhere.\nThe company also says it is not classed as an employment agency and therefore is not covered by the legal regulation as claimed by Equity's \"false assertions\".",

My son was facing the most horrendous suffering and intense pain, I was not going to allow him to go through that.\"\nShe said his suffering and her own ill health had cemented her feelings on assisted deaths.\n\"We don't do it [let them suffer] to our pets. Why should we do it to humans?\" she said.\nCampaigners for a so-called \"right to die\" have argued that people should be able to choose when and how to die in order to avoid suffering.\nCritics have said changing the law would \"place pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives\" for fear of being a financial or emotional burden.\nMPs recently discussed the issue at a parliamentary debate, at which the government said it was a matter of conscience for individual parliamentarians rather than one for government policy.\nIn 1982, after Hamish's death, Mrs Cooper and her husband Alastair joined forces with another couple, Janet and Neville Oldridge.\nThe pair had also lost their five-year-old son Matthew to the same cancer.\nTogether, the couples formed The Neuroblastoma Society, which became Neuroblastoma UK in 2015, to raise awareness and money for research into the disease.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the charity said they had been \"deeply saddened\" by the news.\n\"Antonya\u2019s contributions have been invaluable, and her legacy will live on through the vital research we fund,\" they added.\nMrs Cooper went on to write a book to help families and professionals working with ill children.\nTitled This is Our Child: How Parents Experience the Medical World, the book includes the experiences of real-life parents and teenagers.\nAssisted dying is the phrase used to describe a situation where someone who is terminally ill seeks medical help to obtain lethal drugs which they administer themselves. Assisted suicide, is helping another person end their life.\nBoth are illegal in the UK but recently, Scotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man all announced they are considering changing the law to let terminally ill people end their lives.\nOne hundred and ninety cases have been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service over a 15-year period. While most were not taken forward, there have been four successful prosecutions.\nAfter Mrs Cooper spoke to the BBC last week, Thames Valley Police said in a statement it was \"aware of reports relating to an apparent case of assisted dying of a seven-year-old boy in 1981\".\nIt added: \"At this early stage, the force is making inquiries into these reports and is not in a position to comment further while these investigations continue.\"\nOn Monday, a spokesperson said the force was \"still making enquiries in its investigation\".\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has links to organisations which can offer support and advice\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "An NHS mental health trust has apologised after a woman in its care took her own life after repeatedly calling funeral directors telling them she was planning to kill herself. \nKatie Stonebridge, 27, also told staff at the East London Foundation Trust (ELFT) she would not live to see her next birthday, before she was found dead at her flat in  Bedfordshire in November.\nThe coroner has highlighted gaps in services for autistic people.\nELFT said it had put new safeguards in place to protect patients.\nKatie's mother Julie Stonebridge said her daughter had felt \"overwhelmed\" by the number of different staff and services who had been in contact in the months before her death. \nKatie, who was also diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder, was found at her home in Sandy.\nAn internal ELFT patient safety investigation report said those managing her care \"did not take sufficient account of her diagnosis of autism in terms of care planning and communication\".\n\"There was a lack of systematic collective and comprehensive assessment by services in the face of the patient\u2019s deteriorating mental state,\" it added.\nThe London-based trust had been contracted to provide some mental health services in Bedfordshire.\nTwo funeral directors said Katie had been in contact with them in the month before her death, with one of them saying they had received repeated calls from her asking them plan a funeral as she intended to end her life.\nOn one of these occasions she was visited at home by the Mental Health Crisis Team but the report stated their email requesting a follow up was not \"actioned\".\nIt noted \"a lack of professional curiosity in relation to the patient, for example, evidence she may have active suicide plans which were not explored\".\nKatie had told ELFT staff she had a drink problem and her normally tidy flat had become littered with broken glass and blood.\nHer actions were often deemed \"typical\" but the report highlighted concerns this meant staff had \"normalised\" her behaviour. \nShe had a history of self-harm and visits to A&E had become more frequent as her condition deteriorated in the final weeks of her life.\nTwo months before she died, Katie had been transferred out of an intensive support service called Care Programme Approach (CPA) which she had been in since becoming an adult.\nThe attachment she had formed with the CPA had been disregarded and leaving it had been distressing for her, the report said.\nSubsequent contacts tended to be with duty staff and usually by phone, it added. \nResearch suggesting autistic people were seven times more likely to die from suicide than neurotypical people was highlighted by Emma Whitting, who was the coroner at Ms Stonebridge's inquest, in a letter to ELFT seen by the BBC. \nThree years ago, the same coroner issued a Prevention of Future Deaths Report in relation to Luke Wilden, another autistic patient.\nHis mental health declined after he was moved from supported accommodation to independent living in Bedford after he turned 18.\nJulie Stonebridge said the case had parallels with what had happened with her daughter and she feared \"nothing has been learned from that report\". \nMs Whitting's letter referenced Luke's death and she noted how \"recent policy changes regarding the care provision for those living with autism\" did not \"appear to have been put into practice\". \nLike Luke, Katie had also been moved to independent living in the months prior to her death.\nHer mother felt there were too many professionals involved with no single point of contact, which left her daughter confused, with critical information not acted upon.\n\"Safeguarding emails from the police were sent to Community Mental Health Team,\" she said.\n\"They sent emails at the hospital and because there was no named person to pick them up they went amiss.\"\nA spokesperson for the ELFT said: \"Our thoughts and sincerest condolences are with the friends and family of Katie Stonebridge during this difficult time.\n\"We apologise unreservedly that the standard of care was not at the high levels it should have been, and we are reviewing our provisions in light of Katie\u2019s death.\"\nThey added they were \"committed\" to addressing the issues raised by the coroner.\nIf you have been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "When Punjabi rapper Karan Aujla reflects on his journey so far, he admits it is \"hard to process\".\nBorn in Punjab, his parents died when he was a child and he later moved to Canada \"with just this skill of writing\".\nThe 27-year-old will be touring the UK and Canada in months to come, and his recent release Tauba Tauba will appear in Bad Newz \u2013 the first time he has a track in a Bollywood film.\n\"I'm blessed,\" he tells BBC Asian Network\u2019s Haroon Rashid.\n\"Coming from such a small village and making it across the globe and getting so much love from people and touring.\n\"Getting to experience things that you never even knew existed.\"\nKaran\u2019s hits such as Softly, Don\u2019t Look, Red Eyes and On Top have spent multiple weeks in the Official Asian Music Chart and he has more than 13 million monthly Spotify listeners.\nHe is considered one of the most important artists taking Punjabi music global, along with Diljit Dosanjh and AP Dhillon.\nKaran has previously spoken about having Bollywood offers, but wanting to wait for the right one.\n\"It was so quick, we decided that we wanted a song for the movie. And I made two ideas, sent them over and they picked one.\"\n\"And I'm happy that they did. It just goes with the vibe of the movie.\n\"I never felt out of place, the whole team showed me so much love,\" he adds.\nThere\u2019s sometimes been criticism that to fit into Bollywood, artists need to change their style.\n\"My first thought was to go with a little bit of Hindi. Then I was like OK, that\u2019s not me.\"\n\"It was hard deciding which direction the sound should be\u2026 but it just happened like that.\"\nKaran says he is conscious about being original but also offering things for different audiences.\nThe inspiration behind the song was a friend who is \"into Punjabi music\" and the song is about a \"love for Punjabi music\".\n\"I really wanted it to be easy to catch for the people that don't know Punjabi too much. But I also wanted to keep it [Punjabi] and not have it like a Bollywood sound\".\n\"I want to keep my own tone original,\" he says.\n\"It just makes me so happy that the language barrier is gone and it\u2019s all about music.\n\"It's going global,\u201d he says of Punjabi music.\nKaran says he has a relaxed approach to making music and takes pride in not overthinking things, describing that as \"a big flex\".\n\"Every time I get into the studio, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to write about. I just sit there, listen to the beats, make melodies and it just comes.\n\"I'm really proud of it, because that's how I started as a writer.\"\nDespite increasing success over the years, Karan says he doesn\u2019t \"get nervous\" in the typical way, but that it is \"a different type of feeling\".\n\"Sometimes you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be when you enter these new rooms.\n\"But everybody loves your talent if you\u2019re good.\"\nOne of the things that helps is the people around him, and he says he is big on brotherhood in the industry.\n\"It\u2019s really important for me because I grew up around brothers and friendship has had a big role in my career.\"\nBut he is forward looking as well, and has the tour on his mind with many fans expected to turn out to see him perform.\nHe reveals that it will be \"a different\" sound to his previous tour, with greater production involved.\n\"This time I\u2019m coming out with a new band, and nobody is Punjabi.\n\"Even if I have to put money out of my own pocket, I want to make sure people have the best time of their lives.\"\n\"I\u2019m doing some crazy stuff,\" he teases.\nWith his music though, Karan says he\u2019s just \"trying to go with the flow\".\nHe name-checks Burna Boy and Wizkid as artists who he feels have a sound that \"is so clean\".\nBut his own approach will remain pretty chilled out.\n\"I will never plan things\u2026 it just happens.\n\"That\u2019s the best way to do anything in life.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

He admitted he was \"a little bit scared\" of the new Labour government.\nHowever, the 28-year-old explained that was only due to change.\nHe said: \"I was quite young when Labour were last in power so I can't really remember Labour being in power, so it will be different, but change is always good.\n\"Hopefully he brings in some good changes...

    "A woman who was raped as a 12-year-old child has spoken about how her abuser's actions \"destroyed the person I had the potential to become\" as he was jailed.\nMerseyside Police said Kevin Perry\u2019s predatory behaviour came to light after complaints were made about the child-minding business he later started.\nThe 56-year-old, of Cross Lane in Prescot, was convicted of two rape offences and 13 indecent assaults at Liverpool Crown Court and was jailed for 20 years.\nThe woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she had \"never spoken\" about the abuse before reporting it, but had spent years \"being ashamed and embarrassed about keeping his dirty little secret\".\nThe force said Perry's trial was told his four-year campaign of abuse had started in the 1980s when his victim was 12 years old.\nThe court heard thge abuse began when the girl fell asleep in Perry's car on Southport beach and awoke to find him sexually molesting her.\nAfterwards, he suggested she should be his girlfriend, despite him being ten years older.\nSentencing him, Judge Robert Trevor-Jones said that had been \"a quite cynical device to manipulate her\" and had been the opening to \"a prolonged course of sexual offending against a very vulnerable young girl\".\nPerry went on to sexually assault the girl on numerous occasions, before raping her twice when she was 15.\nIn a statement, the woman said Perry \"destroyed the person I had the potential to become\".\n\"Spending my childhood and early adulthood pretending that what he did to me was normal, was the only way I could cope with the trauma of being abused by him,\" she said.\n\"I have spent my whole life being ashamed and embarrassed about keeping his dirty little secret, as I now know this is what it is, his secret, his wrongdoing, not mine.\"\nShe said she had \"developed an eating disorder and obsessive compulsive disorders of various kinds\" as a result of what happened and that there were \"so many triggers that bring back memories [that] living a normal life seems impossible\".\n\"Last year my marriage broke down because my husband could not cope with the fact that I kept this a secret in our marriage for so long,\" she said.\n\"Whenever I visit the area, I am always tense and scared in case I see him [and] I often find myself panicking.\"\nShe said after reporting the abuse, she \"began taking time off work\", as she was \"unable to cope with the feelings of anxiety [and] only felt safe at home\".\n\"When I returned to work, I had to confide in my boss.\n\"One day they found me crying because I was struggling... and pretending I was ok, when in fact I was falling apart. \n\"Before then, I always loved my job and very rarely took time off, but now I doubt my ability to do my job.\"\nShe added that she hoped she could now \"get the help I need to recover and mend what he has broken\".\nPerry, who showed no reaction as he was sentenced to 20 years in prison, was ordered to sign on the sex offenders register for life and made subject of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order.\nSpeaking after sentencing, Det Sgt Tim Rowlands said Perry's \"utterly depraved actions\" had had a \"significant and long-lasting\" impact on the woman.\n\"Merseyside Police is completely committed to protecting children from sexual abuse from those who seek to do them harm, and we take all such reports extremely seriously,\" he added.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "An annual music festival which mixes big acts with community artists is celebrating its 10th anniversary.\nSunderland's Summer Streets Festival started off as part of Cultural Spring, a programme designed to get more people involved in the arts.\nIt has grown into a standalone event and this year will be taking place at Cliffe Park in Roker this weekend.\nThe festival's founder, Ross Millard, said Summer Streets was a chance to enjoy live music while giving families the chance to \"pick up an instrument\" for the first time.\n\"The idea of the festival was always the same, to have established headline artists with more emerging and community performers,\" Mr Millard said.\n\"Sunderland is one of those places where there are lots of small organisations beavering away. Summer Streets Festival is a good conversion point to bring those organisations together to show what is going on in the city.\"\nThe festival has grown over the last 10 years, but Mr Millard said it had faced challenges, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"We did keep the festival going throughout that period, although it morphed into something different,\" he said.\nTo keep the event going during lockdown, Summer Streets created the Festival in Your House, using recordings with artists which people could watch at home.\nIt also relied more on its YouTube channel and launched a quiz.\nBut despite surviving the pandemic, Mr Millard said organising the festival was still \"extremely precarious\".\n\"There is no guarantee that because it is here this year it will be here next year, which is the case with arts events these days,\" he said.\n\"It's about making the case to the council about the value of these events.\"\nThis year's line-up includes acts such as Field Music, Royal Northern Sinfonia, Sunderland Empire Academy Singers and festival favourites Dilutey Juice.\nThose wanting to try their hand at playing an instrument will be able to take part in music workshops run by Sunderland Music Hub. \nEngland's Euros match against Switzerland will also be shown live on a big screen.\nBut for Mr Millard, one of the highlights of this year's festival will be Tom A.

    "For Neil Cole, helping to stop knife crime is personal.\nIt was in August 2019 that one of his former pupils took part in the brutal murder of Harry Baker, 17, at Barry Docks in Vale of Glamorgan.\n\"I never thought he\u2019d end up like that,\" said Mr Cole, who is one of those taking part in a campaign - Not the One - that aims to tackle the issue of knife crime in south Wales. \n\"I wish I could\u2019ve had the conversation with him that I\u2019m having with these kids today,\" Mr Cole said. \nHe had previously been a primary school teacher of Brandon Liversidge, who was 17 when he was one of four people found guilty of murdering teenager Mr Baker.\nLiversidge was a rival drug dealer who led the chase of Harry Baker and was just 16 when he stabbed him to death.\nMr Cole described the path Liversidge had gone down as \"tragic\", saying he had been a \"lovely kid\" while in school.\nNot the One aims to use trusted adults - such as parents, carers, sports coaches or teachers - to provoke discussions on the issue of knife crime inside and outside the classroom.\nThe issue is a growing concern across the UK - particularly among young people - and the campaign, led by South Wales Police and the Wales Violence Prevention Unit, is educating 11 to 16-year-olds in south Wales about the dangers of carrying knives.\nThe name comes from the fact that about one out of 100 young people carry a knife, urging people not to \"be the one\".\nMr Cole said the students were heavily engaged in the knife crime component, which includes an interview with Harry Baker's mum, who said her son's murder had \"destroyed\" her. \nMr Cole described that interview as \"really powerful\", adding one of the reasons was because the killing occurred \"just a few miles down the road\".\nMr Cole, who now works for the charity School of Hard Knocks, said he uses the campaign in intervention classes his charity conducts in schools in south Wales.\nHe said much of what it focuses on is early intervention, particularly with those who have \"become disengaged with school\" - adding many have experienced trauma.\nMr Cole added a stabbing at a school in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, in April often came up in discussion, opening up \"really powerful conversations\" with students.\n\"What we try to communicate to them is that at some point in their future they\u2019re going to be left with a choice of going one of two ways. They can take one path, towards gangs and crime, or take another path.\n\"We want them to take the other path, and to really think about the decisions they\u2019re making,\" he said.\nAlso taking part in the campaign is Claire Millar, who has worked as a youth worker in south Wales for 25 years.\nShe said she had never encountered a young person who carries a knife because they intend to use it, but because they want to \"protect themselves\". \n\"But if you get that knife out, anything can happen,\" she said.\n\"If you hit someone in the neck, their life is gone, their family\u2019s life is destroyed, and your life is destroyed because you\u2019re going to prison,\" she said.\nMs Millar said the campaign aims to encourage young people to make \"the right informed choices to change their own lives for the better\".\nMany of those who carry knives have been recruited into so-called county lines gangs, she said, and have been targeted because of their vulnerability.\n\"Young people who are getting involved in knife crime are not bad people. They\u2019re hurting, they\u2019re lost, they often don\u2019t have a sense of belonging in society,\" she said.\n\"So we're trying to change that.\"\nStatistics show knife crime in Wales rose slightly in 2023 compared with a year earlier, with 1,626 serious offences involving a knife or sharp instrument, accounting for 4% of all serious offences.\nAlthough an increase since before 2019, the rate in Wales is well below the national average \u2013 there were 52 offences per 100,000, compared with 89 per 100,000 across England and Wales.\nSupt Esyr Jones, from South Wales Police, said the Not the One campaign had contributed to knife crime among young people in the region \"plummeting\", pointing to a drop in the number of young people being admitted to hospital for assault or knife-related injuries.\nHe said the idea for the campaign came after the force saw a number of issues with knife crime in 2019 and 2020, describing them as a \"watershed moment\".\nThe aim is both to debunk the \"myth\" everyone is carrying a knife - with one of the main reasons people give for carrying is thinking that others are - and work with trusted adults who can make an impact in young people\u2019s lives.\nSupt Jones said police officers would conduct speeches in schools on the issue of knife crime, but \"the feedback was that the engagement didn\u2019t really make a difference\".\n\"But people listened to teachers, youth leaders, school nurses, dinner ladies \u2013 these are the people who hold the power in these people\u2019s lives. They\u2019re not there for one session, they\u2019re there all the time,\" he said.\nHe admitted it was a \"novel approach\" to policing, but came a",

    "A desperate search is under way in northern Australia for a child feared to have been taken by a crocodile.\nThe 12-year-old was last seen around dusk on Tuesday, swimming near the remote town of Nganmarriyanga - about a 7-hour drive south west of Darwin in the Northern Territory (NT).\nPolice say a specialist search and rescue team has been deployed after \"initial reports stated the child had been attacked by a crocodile\".\nThe NT is home to an estimated 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere else in the world, but attacks are uncommon.\nCommunity members in Nganmarriyanga - previously known as Palumpa and home to only 364 people - and local police began searching for the child immediately after they vanished in Mango Creek around 17:30 local time (08:00 GMT). \nThey have now been joined by additional officers and the expert search and rescue team who are combing over both land and water.\nAn aerial search may also be launched, according to local media.\nNT Police Minister Brent Potter on Wednesday afternoon said the operation had entered the \"recovery phase\".\n\"It's a tragic incident for any parent or family member to lose a young child, and especially in the circumstances like that, taken by a crocodile,\" he told reporters.\nCrocodiles involved in attacks on humans in Australia are usually captured and killed. Mr Potter said wildlife officers have been authorised to \"remove\" the crocodile from the area once it is located and reiterated the government's safety message.\n\"We live in a place where crocodiles occupy our water places... it's just a reminder to stay out of the water as best we can.\"\nFound all around the northern edges of Australia - from Broome in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland - saltwater crocodiles were hunted to near extinction but numbers have bounced back since the practice was banned in the 1970s.\nThere have been at least two other crocodile attacks in the NT in the past year - a nine-year-old boy who was injured in January while swimming in Kakadu National Park, and a farmer who escaped a beast's jaws by biting it back in October - but there has not been a fatal attack there since 2018.\nQueensland, however, has had a series of deadly attacks in recent years, including a 16-year-old boy who was killed in the Torres Strait in April.",

I know it\u2019s just a game, but it's something that I love doing,\" she said.\nDespite these challenges, Ms Lewis said that both Humberside County Darts and her team, Inglemire, had been supportive - something she described as \"very heart-warming\".\nEngland Darts has issued a statement on its website addressing its stance on the inclusion of transgender women in women's events.\n\"England Darts has canvassed its players and executives on this very important issue concerning the future of women's darts, and how England can continue to protect the integrity within our sport for its female members,\" it said.\nIt added that including \"non-birth-gender females\" in women's competitions could \"ultimately result in the demise of our women\u2019s sport\".\nOther darts competitions do allow transgender women to compete, depending on their testosterone levels.\nWhile Ms Lewis qualifies for them, she is taking a break at the moment to focus on her mental health.\nHer message to people who have contributed to her current struggles is a plea for empathy and respect.\n\"Just keep your opinions to yourself. I\u2019m still human at the end of the day. Think before you speak,\" she said.\n\"I don't want to quit. I want to carry on.\"\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.",
    "Somerset Council will meet on Monday to decide whether to pay its waste contractor an extra \u00a347m over the next six years.\nIt comes after the company Suez said the agreed contract is \"no longer sustainable\" and that it was seeking increased payments having seen the cost of delivering the services far exceed projections. \nCouncillors have agreed to meet with the firm next week to avoid losing the service, after it said Suez would \"consider walking away, accepting the hefty financial penalty that would come with exiting early\".\nThe negotiations could see Somerset Council paying Suez an extra \u00a33m this year and an extra \u00a347m over the next six years.\nBut it said it would also explore bringing the service \"in-house\" or whether the contract could be put out to tender.\nThe dispute comes at a difficult time for Somerset Council which has declared a financial emergency.\nSuez deals with the county's household rubbish and recycling collections.\nSouth West regional director for Suez, Mark Taylor, said in a statement that the past four years \"have been a time of unprecedented change\".\nHe added: \"The challenges of starting the contract at the height of the pandemic, rolling out new services, and post pandemic inflationary pressures have seen the cost of delivering the services far exceed projections. \n\"We have been working through the impacts of this on the contract with the council, as the significant financial losses Suez has incurred are no longer sustainable.\n\"We believe we had legitimate claims for an increase in payments, so we welcome the conciliatory and pragmatic approach the council has taken to addressing our concerns.\"\nSomerset Council said all the options on the table are \"substantially\" more than it is currently paying and it is recommending officers continue its contract with Suez.\nLead member for environment and climate change, Dixie Darch, said: \"This is a hugely frustrating position to be in, but all ways forward involve paying more. \n\"What is being recommended is very much the 'least worst' option.\n\"These are not options we expected or want to consider, but we have to make sure this vital service continues.\"\nMs Darch said there was a detailed competitive tendering process, but \"we are in very different times to when this contract was signed\". \nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "A charity which helps homeless people has achieved its dream of buying a day centre to provide more support to those in need.\nLeeds-based Homeless Street Angels has raised more than \u00a3100,000 to put down as a deposit for a centre in Sheepscar.\nNamed after founders Becky and Shelley Joyce's sister, who died when the charity was established in 2017, Abi House has always been their main goal.\nBecky said the centre would be a \"family-orientated space where people could feel safe\".\nBecky, from Alwoodley, said she had experienced addiction when she was younger and had been through \"dark times\" so understood the struggles of those the charity helped.\n\"To the commissioned services, some of the people come across as difficult and won't work with them because of their issues,\" she said.\n\"But it's a case of finding out why they have got the problems they do and how best to address them.\n\"It's about building their confidence and giving them life skills so they can break out of the cycle they're in.\n\"Every Wednesday, I take some of the people I help to the dentist so they can get their smiles back.\"\nShe said the inspiration for the charity came following the death of their sister.\n\"We threw ourselves into helping the guys on the streets to keep ourselves busy and then we saw the difference we were making so we worked even harder.\" \nShe said their sister's three children were involved with the charity work and she was \"really proud\" of they help they gave\n\"It's the whole family in the charity, our mum is involved too. For us, it's something good to have come out of a really sad situation.\"\nThe new centre, on Claypitt Lane in Sheepscar, will include a reception area, a furniture store, art room and kitchen.\nIt will also be home to a food bank to help the hundreds of people that the charity has on its register.\nThe base also means that the charity can take on more volunteers, which in turn would \"help save the lives of the people we support\".\n\"For those on the streets, we're the closet thing they've got to family.

    "Four Warwickshire MPs have penned a letter to the county's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), demanding a public apology for his attendance at a student dinner, which saw some guests singing along to a Nazi marching tune.\nAccording to the PCC's office, Philip Seccombe paid to attend the University of Warwick Conservative Association's dinner on 15 June in a personal capacity.\nThe four Labour MPs - Matt Western, John Slinger, Rachel Taylor, and Jodie Gosling - said they had lost confidence in Mr Seccombe.\n\"I want to publicly confirm that I was not present for this part and had left the event before any music started,\" he said in a statement.\n\"I am deeply saddened to be associated with such abhorrent conduct,\" he said.\nHe added that he had recieved the letter, and wanted to assure residents that the actions of the students should not be tolerated.\n\"Warwickshire Police are now investigating this incident and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time,\" he added.\nA video shared on social media after the dinner appeared to show people at the off-campus event singing and dancing to World War Two era song Erika.\nIt was composed in 1930 by Herms Niel, who became a troop leader in the Nazis' paramilitary wing.\n\"Your inability to call out this despicable behaviour both at the time and subsequent to it becoming public knowledge represents a failure of moral leadership,\" read the letter, which was posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday.\n\"It should not require the tabling of a Freedom of Information request for the public to become aware that one of their representatives actively participated in the same event in which Nazi songs were sung.\"\nThe letter went on to demand a public apology from Mr Seccombe, and asked that he reject any future political support from the association until the matter had been dealt with. \n\"We, and many others, have lost confidence in your ability to represent the people of Warwickshire.

    "Talks aimed at saving jobs at Tata Steel have been described as \"extremely positive\" by the Unite union.\nThe new UK government's negotiations with the firm over its restructure had previously been dubbed as \"difficult\" by Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds.\nMr Reynolds pledged that the UK government has \"got to try\" to change the steel giant's plans, which will cost 2,800 jobs.\nTata will close the second of its Port Talbot blast furnaces in September, citing losses of \u00a31m a day.\nMr Reynolds met unions on Wednesday to discuss efforts to reach a \"better deal\" with the company.\nThe previous Conservative government pledged \u00a3500m to Tata Steel towards the cost of a new \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace which will melt scrap steel, but which requires far fewer workers than traditional blast furnaces.\nThe company closed the first of two blast furnaces on 5 July, and plans to shut the second in September.\nConstruction of the new furnace is scheduled to begin in August 2025.\n\"Our meeting this morning with Jonathan Reynolds was extremely positive,\" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham. \n\"The commitment given to achieving a sustainable, profitable UK steel industry is very welcome and, as was said this morning, decarbonisation must not mean deindustrialisation.\"\nShe described the Labour government's input as a potential \"game changer\".\nBut, as Mr Reynolds told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: \"There is a lot more that this deal could do. I know it's going to be difficult, but I think I've got to try.\"\nDelaying the proposed closure date of the second blast furnace was something he had already raised, Mr Reynolds said, but he accepted that Tata's position had been \"very unmovable\" on that.\nHe said the talks were about \"more than just the future of that last remaining blast furnace\".\n\"There are questions as to how quickly the transition happens, and the scale and size of the new furnaces that might be put in place,\" he said.\n\"Steel is vital for a vibrant, secure economy and our steel sector needs a government working in partnership with trade unions and business to secure a green steel transition that\u2019s right for the workforce whilst delivering economic growth.\"\nTata Steel has reiterated its pre-election stance that it would press ahead with its plans, regardless of which party was in Downing Street.\nUK chief executive Rajesh Nair said he would \"be engaging with new ministers\" over its \"ambitious plans to invest in and transform Port Talbot\" and \"supporting our workers through this necessary but difficult transition\".\nCommunity, the largest union representing steelworkers, has warned that the new government was \"up against it\" and had four to six weeks to change Tata's plans. \nAnother union, Unite, called off strike action to return to discussions over the restructure. Redundancy packages have mostly been agreed, and those talks will now focus on future investment plans by Tata. \nProposals about future investment include discussions about a steel plate mill being built in Port Talbot, which could supply the materials to build wind turbines.\nLabour campaigned on the promise of a \u00a32.5bn fund for the future of the steel industry and has committed to continuing the previous government's plans to provide \u00a3500m towards Port Talbot's new electric furnace.",
    "The two men behind the world premiere stage adaptation of hit horror film Paranormal Activity currently know all about being woken by loud cries in the middle of the night.\nDirector Felix Barrett and writer Levi Holloway's nocturnal activity isn't paranormal, though. It's parental.\n\"We both have six-month-old babies,\" Holloway says to explain why the pair are even more bleary-eyed than they might usually be in the frantic final preparations for a major new show.\n\"The only paranormal activity I know is at 03:30 with the cry for milk. That comes quite regularly at the moment,\" Barrett jokes.\n\"Yeah, we're both very haunted,\" Holloway adds wryly.\nThey haven't let night-time disturbances stop them from coming to the Leeds Playhouse theatre's caf\u00e9 first thing in the morning to talk about their production - and fill up on coffee - before starting their last week of rehearsals.\nWith Paranormal Activity, they are taking on a modern horror classic.\nIn 2009, the film terrified audiences by showing an everyday young couple, Katie and Micah, at the mercy of unexplained forces in their San Diego home.\nIt became one of the most profitable films ever, if box office takings are compared with the original production budget. It cost just $15,000 (\u00a38,000) to make and went on to earn $193m (\u00a3125m) - then spawned a franchise that took another $700m (\u00a3435m).\nThe stage version isn't a simple recreation, but few details have been revealed so far.\nInstead of posting the usual promotional blurb to persuade us to buy a ticket, the theatre website simply lists Barrett and Holloway's names, then adds: \"We can\u2019t say anything else.\" (Although if you click on the obligatory trigger warning, it also pledges that the show will feature \"loud noises, sudden darkness, blood and gore with references to mental health\".)\nBarrett and Holloway give up some more scraps of information.\n\"I think we can comfortably say that it's wildly different than the film,\" says playwright Holloway.\n\"Wildly different but I think still familiar,\" Barrett adds.\n\"It takes its essence. The events are different, but the texture and the quality is very much inspired by the film because it's very effective.\n\"If people love Paranormal Activity, then they'll bond with this for sure.\"\nUnusually, the theatre hasn't even announced who's in the cast or which characters they will play. Will there be actors playing Katie and Micah?\n\"Well, it\u2019s not Katie and Micah for starters,\" Barrett replies. \"It\u2019s a different couple.\"\nA couple who haven't appeared in the film franchise?\n\"Correct,\" Holloway confirms.\n\"Can we say that it's...\" Barrett trails off. \"I don't know what we can say.\"\nHe puts his hand up to his mouth in an attempt to privately confer with his collaborator. \"Can we say that it\u2019s a couple who have come...\"\n\"Yeah,\" Holloway decides. He turns back to me: \"It's about an American couple who have moved to London, and they've brought something with them.\n\"And I think we can also say there are four cast members. So it's a tight-knit ensemble.\"\n\"Intimate,\" Barrett adds. \"Just as the film is. It's very claustrophobic.\"\nThe director also divulges that, as in the film, the action takes place in a house. What's more, it's haunted.\n\"All the best ghost stories feature a house. It's almost the other character.\"\nThe Anglo-American storyline perhaps reflects an ambition for the show to transfer to the West End after its try-out in Leeds, then - if it goes down well - presumably across the Atlantic.\nIt also reflects the make-up of this creative partnership - Holloway is American, and last year Broadway hosted his spooky play Grey House, starring Orphan Black's Tatiana Maslany, double Tony Award winner Laurie Metcalf and A Quiet Place's Millicent Simmonds.\nBarrett, meanwhile, is one of the most innovative and influential British directors of the past 25 years, pioneering immersive theatre with his company Punchdrunk.\nIn 2013, the Observer hailed him as \"the visionary who reinvented theatre\".\nBarrett and Punchdrunk's speciality is staging shows in abandoned buildings  and other unusual spaces, where the performances unfold around audience members as they wander from room to room.\nSo it's a surprise to find him in an actual theatre, with old-fashioned things like  a stage and seats.\n\"Actually it was a deliberate choice to respect the machinery of theatre,\" he says of his decision to direct Paranormal Activity.\n\"The simplicity of seeing the story on stage is what drove me to do it, and why I immediately said yes.\n\"I quite like the fact that there's a sense of security of being in an auditorium,\" he goes on.\n\"This piece isn't going to flip theatricality on its head. Far from it. The actual narrative, and the tendrils of that, will creep out from the stage and grab the audience.\n\"And it feels great to be embracing good old-fashioned stagecraft. I haven\u2019t done that for a while.\"\nWhile horror films are enduringly popular, there's been a rise in scary shows on stage in recent years.\nHolloway believ",
    "Dangers posed by hospital equipment shortages have been highlighted following the death of a heart bypass patient.\nMichael Walton suffered a lack of blood flow to the brain after the surgeon carrying out the operation at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital had to use an alternative type of cannula, which dislodged from the 66-year-old's aorta.\nGeorgina Nolan, senior coroner for Newcastle and North Tyneside, has written to the government and NHS England to highlight the risks caused by supply issues.\nThe Department of Health described it as a \"tragic case\" and said it was \"important that we learn the lessons\" from every such incident. NHS England said it was \"carefully considering\" the report.\nIn a prevention of future death report, sent when a coroner thinks action is needed to protect lives, Ms Nolan said Mr Walton had been considered a \"a good candidate for the surgery\" which was carried out on 13 June last year.\nHowever, the surgeon's preferred choice of cannula - a tube inserted into the body - \"was not available for the procedure due to supply issues\", leading them to use one with a slightly shorter tip.\n\"The cannula type contributed to its dislodgement from the lumen of the aorta and to Mr Walton\u2019s death,\" Ms Nolan added.\n\nMr Walton died at Carlisle's Eden Valley Hospice a month later.\nAn inquest concluded his death was \"due to a very rare complication of a necessary surgical procedure\".\nListing her concerns in the newly issued report, Ms Nolan warned: \"Operating surgeons are best placed to decide on the most appropriate equipment to use and should not be restricted in that choice by supply shortages.\n\"Using sub-optimal medical equipment poses an avoidable risk to patients of significant harm including death.\"\nThe Department of Health must formally respond to the report by 29 August.\nIn a statement to the BBC, it said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with Michael's family and friends in this tragic case.\n\"It is important that we learn the lessons from every prevention of future deaths report.\n\"The department has received the report and will consider it carefully before responding in due course.\"\nNHS England added it would also \"respond in due course\" and it \"extends its deepest sympathies\" to Mr Walton's family and friends.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Many children dream about one day being a mermaid beneath the waves. And some have gone on to make it their reality. \nAfter a long day as a pool attendant, Tyler Turner threw her keys on the table and wished she could have been a mermaid like she imagined as a girl.\n\"Then a lightbulb went off in my head,\" she said. \nSeven years on, she is often found in the sea with her tail and said it \"saved my life\".  \nMermaiding - wearing a mermaid tail - became popular in America in 2015 and over the years qualifications and groups have popped up in the UK. \nThere are many different types of tails, but they all bind the swimmer's legs together and incorporate a monofin - one joined together flipper - which helps to propel you through the water. \nTyler, 30, of Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said she was going to therapy for chronic depression and anxiety, and found \"being under water like being in a meditative state\".  \n\"If I didn't discover mermaiding, I don't think I'd be here any more,\" she said. \nShe said to some wearing a mermaid tail was a hobby, a profession, or a sport: there was even a global mermaid championship in 2019. \nFor her, though, \"it's a way of life\" because she combines it with her love for conservation, education and modelling. \n\"When I'm in the sea, it feels very much like you're coming out of a busy Tube or city and going straight into a nice, sacred, wholesome area with no distractions - you feel at one with yourself. \n\"I used to dream when I was a kid that I was a mermaid and swimming in the sea with dolphins - and to actually do that, it's just euphoric.\n\"I've come across a seal once. I was swimming off Prestatyn beach and I just saw its head pop up,\" she said. \n\"I turned around and swam away.\n\"A lot of animals are curious, but we are marine conservationists,\" she said. \"It's within our soul to look after the environment, so it's really important to respect their space.\n\"The world's so magical because it's natural - we are just there to observe.\"\nWhen she bought her first tail she was a lone mermaid, but over the years she has found a group of like-minded people. \nShe is part of D\u0175r Tails, a north Wales group of 11 people who dress up as mermaids.\nBut finding places to train and swim in a tail is hard. \nTyler said leisure centre pools \"don't really like the mermaid aspect of it - I think because of health and safety\". \nShe said \"it's really important to get your qualifications\" and \"don't do anything stupid, because it doesn't just affect your life - it affects the whole community\".\nLukas Stevenson, 29, from Ruthin, Denbighshire, set up Scuba Schools International-backed mermaid training at Ysgol y M\u00f4r sea school in 2023. \n\"Mermaiding is like putting together swimming, snorkelling, free diving,\" he said.\n\"You go underwater and you pretend you are a dolphin and you just forget about the world completely,\" he said. \n\"I'm just swimming in the seaweed and looking at the crabs, the fish - even jellyfish.\n\"I feel like I am part of the ocean.\"\nBut there is a lot of training involved. \nHe said: \"You really need to have a strong core and strong leg movement to actually propel yourself with [the monofin].\"\nHe said lots of mermaids bought unsafe equipment and did not have the safety training which he called \"very, very dangerous\". \nTraining begins in a swimming pool, where mermaids-to-be learn how to safely escape the confines of their tails if they get into difficulty. They are also taught rescue techniques in case someone experiences shallow water blackout. \nLukas said mer-people should always swim in a buddy system to stay safe at sea. \nSo far 11 students have progressed through the stages to swimming in the ocean, and 16 are still in training. \nEmily-Sian Barker, 30, from Conwy, got into mermaiding during lockdown after seeing it on social media. She said it had helped to \"heal [her] inner child\" and feel \"empowered\". \nEmily-Sian said: \"It doesn't matter what people say, who's watching and who's opinionated about it - If you're loving it, and you're safe then that is all that matters. It's euphoric.\" \nThe Dwr Tails are organising a mermaid \"wash-up\" on Anglesey to educate children about the environment. \nThe plan is to swim up from the ocean onto the beach and talk about marine conservation to children. The group is in talks with the coastguard and the RNLI. \n\"Whenever I do the school visits, I go as a mermaid and I tell the kids this is what I experience - all this litter,\" Tyler said.\n\"One of my silicone tails even has a bit of a slash on it and I say 'that's what happened when a carrier bag got caught round my fin'. \n\"The kids really listen to it,\" she said. \"They feel like they have a purpose to help.\"\nIf you have been affected by any issues raised in this article, help and support can be found at BBC Action Line.",
    "Millions of people pass through Brighton railway station each year, but how many are aware of the secrets below their feet?\nHidden beneath the tracks are mosaic bathrooms, World War Two communication rooms and even a rifle range.\nBrighton\u2019s network of underground secrets stretches far across the city, with Victorian sewer systems, a hidden road, and tunnels below the Royal Pavilion rumoured to be built for King George IV to meet his lover. \nThe BBC has been given special access to this seaside labyrinth to find out what it reveals about the city that lies above. \n\u201cNobody would know this was here,\u201d says Rob Whitehead, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) community engagement manager. \nHe is sorting through a ball of keys that unlock a door from the busy station concourse.\nIt leads to a staircase that is now grubby but would once have gleamed with shiny, turquoise tiles. Posters informing commuters that the passage will close in 2005 are still on the walls. \nBelow are the station's former public toilets, old entrances from Trafalgar Street and a women\u2019s hairdressers \u2013 all of which are now storage spaces for the shops above.\nFurther into the depths of the station, a cobbled road runs alongside its old east wall.\n\u201cIt was how the old horse-drawn cabs used to get up onto the platform,\u201d says Rob. \nA new external wall was added when the station expanded, meaning the road was hidden away.\nBrighton Station was built in 1840 but it was not until 1928 that the toilets and now-faded mosaics were added.\nAnother abandoned space is a former service tunnel deep inside the station, previously used to load goods onto trains but converted during World War Two.\n\u201cThey moved all the telecommunications for the railway down here,\u201d Rob explains. \u201cIf the station was ever bombed, they could still operate from this space.\u201d\nBut at the far end of the tunnel is the station's best-kept secret.\n\u201cYou can hear the gentle rumble of a train above our heads,\" says Rob. \"It\u2019s a very secluded space, so a rifle range is a perfect use for this space.\" \nBuilt for recreational shooting practice in the late 1940s, the range is still used by a rifle club today.\nThe station was key in connecting Brighton with the rest of the UK. By 1850, it had grown from a fishing village to a hub of more than 60,000 residents and was a tourist hotspot. \nThousands flocked from London as the sea water was rumoured to have healing qualities.\nBut at the time, sewage flowed from people's homes into cesspools. \nIt was not until the late 1800s that engineers built a sewer network sprawling 30 miles (48 km) under Brighton, costing \u00a3104,000 \u2013 an equivalent of \u00a314.7m today.\nIt allowed sewage to flow away from homes and out to sea.\nThe sewers are still operational today, though sewage is treated at a new plant in Peacehaven.\nIn the 18th century, Brighton had become a popular getaway for the Royal Family. The Royal Pavilion was built in 1787 for the Prince of Wales George IV, who became the Prince Regent in 1811 and King George IV in 1820.\nBelow the Pavilion is a network of tunnels which had many different uses - from storing dirty laundry to accessing George\u2019s private bedroom.\nIt was rumoured that King George IV had a tunnel built so he could secretly walk underground to the house of Maria Fitzherbet, his lover. \nBut Dan Cox, head tour guide for Brighton & Hove Museums, said this is unfounded.\n\"I\u2019m sorry to disappoint people,\" he said. \"There was nothing secret about their relationship.\u201d\nThe King did, however, spend \u00a31,783 - an equivalent of \u00a3164,082 today - on a tunnel to keep his servants hidden from the gardens as they went between the Pavilion and the stables, now the popular concert venue Brighton Dome.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of guy that George was,\u201d said Dan.\nDan added that the team at the Pavilion are still uncovering secrets about the building, meaning some of Brighton's buried mysteries are yet to be revealed.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "England take on Spain in Sunday\u2019s Euro 2024 final in Berlin, the first meeting between the sides at the Euros since a quarter-final at Wembley in 1996.\nFor almost half the players on the pitch, there will be a familiar face on the opposing side - somebody they play with in the Premier League every week, or an old friend from Spain's top league, La Liga.\nHere's how the two teams are connected, and what these players say about their friends-turned-rivals.\nArguably England\u2019s highest profile current export, Jude Bellingham has just completed a stellar debut season at Real Madrid, finishing not only as a Champions League winner but also La Liga\u2019s player of the season.\nBellingham could line up against his teammate Dani Carvajal, and Nacho, who has just left Real Madrid for Saudi Pro League side Al-Qadsiah.\nBellingham has played in every game for England en route to the final, but Carvajal has played in four for Spain and Nacho only three.\nCarvajal was impressed when Bellingham arrived in Madrid, saying he \u201cblew him away\u201d when he saw him training. \nBut when asked who he would pick for the Ballon d\u2019Or recently (the award for the world's best player in any given year), the Spanish defender chose himself over Bellingham.\nEurope\u2019s other dominant club in recent seasons \u2013 Premier League champions Manchester City \u2013 are well represented in Sunday\u2019s showpiece.\nMidfielder Rodri \u2013 who has featured in five of the six games in the competition so far \u2013 will look across the tunnel before kick off and see club mates Kyle Walker, John Stones and Phil Foden. \nThree other players in Spain's squad \u2013 Jesus Navas, Ferran Torres and defender Aymeric Laporte \u2013 also formerly plied their trade in the blue half of Manchester.\nRodri has said he \u201cloves\u201d Foden, adding that the midfielder \u201cneeds to be kept under control\u201d due to his ability to get into tight spaces.\nThere\u2019s been a Spanish feel to Arsenal\u2019s play over the last few years, led by manager Mikel Arteta.\nThe Gunners will be represented by Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice for England - the two midfielders have been ever-present for the Three Lions in Germany.\nArsenal's two goalkeeper's have had less playing time.\nSpain\u2019s David Raya has played in just one game in Germany so far, the 1-0 win over Albania after Spain had already advanced from the group stage. Aaron Ramsdale has not been so lucky, playing not a single minute so far in the competition.\nRaya knows other England players well: he played with England stars Ollie Watkins and Ivan Toney while they were all at Brentford, before he move to Arsenal and Watkins joined Aston Villa.\nChelsea duo Cole Palmer and Conor Gallagher will be familiar with the immediately recognisable figure of Marc Cucurella.\nThe Spanish defender has played in five of their six games at Euro 2024, but his English counterparts have had to be more patient.\nNot that Palmer will be complaining about his playing time - it was his pass after coming on as a sub against the Netherlands in the semi-final which set up Ollie Watkins\u2019 last-gasp winner.\nAlso in the England squad - albeit yet to play in the Euros - is Lewis Dunk, who played with Cucurella when the Spaniard was at Brighton & Hove Albion.\nEngland defender Kieran Trippier spent three years in Spain playing for Atletico Madrid before joining Newcastle United in 2022. \nDuring his time in the Spanish capital, he was a teammate of Spain captain Alvaro Morata, who this week limped off the field following their semi-final win against France, after a photographer slipped into him during the post-match celebrations.\nBut, of course, the pleasantries will be put aside for 90 minutes (at least) on Sunday.

    "An artist who painted 50 scenes along the South West Coast Path is staging an exhibition of the works inspired by her time on the famous route.\nThe 630-mile (1,014 km) coastal path, linking Dorset's Studland Bay all the way to Minehead on the north coast of Somerset, takes in some of the UK's most spectacular scenery.\nEmma Scattergood created 50 works to mark half a century since the start of efforts to create the complete coast path.\nShe said the experience was \"absolutely brilliant and life-changing\".\n\nThe challenge was a step back in time for the former university lecturer, revisiting stretches of the path where she walked and played as a child growing up in Devon.\nIt was also fundraising for Dementia UK in memory of her mother Nancy for whom she had cared and who shared a love for the coast path.\nWalking the path in stages throughout 2023, among the more memorable moments, she recalled battling along the path in Cornwall through Storm Noa.\n\"It was utterly terrifying and slightly ill-advised. I was scared, but I did it,\" she said.\nShe said the \"kindness of strangers\" was apparent throughout - from a woman in Cornwall who lent her a towel for an impromptu skinny dip in, to a couple who offered her a bed in their B&B in Cape Hope.\n\"When I look back at what I set out to do, it was utterly brilliant and life changing\".\n\"After years of being a carer, I felt I'd lost myself and my sense of who I was. \n\"Going out on the coast path, I feel I've been allowed to take the time and space to find my own voice - it makes you realise you are more resilient than you think.\nFrom 1973, the South West Coast Path Association campaigned and gradually opened the path in sections before it was designated as a National Trail five years later.\nMs Scattergood who rediscovered her passion for art during the Covid lockdowns, was also fundraising for the South West Coast Path Association.\nWalking along the path in Dorset and Devon meant she saw first hand the disruption and costly movements of the path following cliffs falls and landslides.\nThe walks also gave her the opportunity to develop workshops for individuals and groups to make a connection between creative activity and wellbeing through connecting with nature.\n\"I'd encourage people to take a notebook with them when they go out, look around and enjoy the benefits of being out in nature.\n\"It's opened so many doors - being able to create space in life to take time for nature - it's so important and makes things happen,\" she said.\nAn exhibition of Ms Scattergood's paintings of scenes from the coast path is on at Durlston Country Park near Swanage from 6-15 July.\nFollow BBC South on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, or\u00a0Instagram.

    "It is just 10:00 on a weekday morning in July and ambulances are \"stacking\" outside hospitals across the east of Scotland, dispatcher Tabbitha Haston tells me.\nAlready, half of Aberdeen\u2019s available ambulances are stuck outside the A&E at the city\u2019s Royal Infirmary.\nAnd a quarter of those available in Fife are parked outside the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy waiting to hand over patients.\nAmbulances queuing up outside packed A&E departments waiting for patients to be taken in for treatment used to be a problem reserved for the busiest winter months.\nBut now it's an everyday occurrence - even in the summer.\n\"It\u2019s no good for patients and it\u2019s no good for emergency calls,\u201d says Tabbitha.\nShe knows that every ambulance crew sitting outside a hospital leaves her with fewer resources to send to other calls.\nThe east of Scotland ambulance control centre deals with about 2,000 calls a day - and it is one of three regional centres in Scotland.\nAt the start of this month, the average time it took an ambulance to drop a patient at a Scottish hospital was just over an hour.\nOne way to alleviate the pressure is to cut the number of people taken to A&E in an ambulance.\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) says almost half of 999 calls don\u2019t actually require a patient to be rushed to hospital.\nAs a result, each SAS control centre now has a clinical hub team \u2013 made up of GPs, clinical advisers, nurses and advanced paramedics - whose job it is to assess calls that are categorised as not immediately life-threatening.  \nThey offer phone and online medical help or can tap into community resources such as Hospital at Home, GPs or pharmacies, or they can help direct patients to appropriate hospital care.\nThe SAS says in the last year more than 50,000 unnecessary ambulance journeys have been saved.\nDr Gareth Evans is the SAS' associate medical director. \nHe believes early preliminary assessment can save patients \"a lot of unnecessary effort and a lot of unnecessary journeys\".\nDr Evans added: \"Most patients know what they need but they sometimes struggle to access the care that they need, and they find themselves in the wrong bit of the system. \n\"So we will often find ourselves managing patients that could be managed elsewhere.\"\nHe says patients might be managed in the pharmacy where they can get the drugs they need or by out-of-hours GP services or they might be able to take themselves to hospital.\nIn June, more than a third of calls dealt with by the clinical hub didn\u2019t require an ambulance response. \nSAS say that avoided about 4,200 ambulance dispatches.\nDr Evans says hospitals and GPs are working hard but there is a lot of demand on the NHS. \n\"There's a lot of illness, there's a lot of frailty, and people just want that care when they're ill when they're in that moment of need,\" he said.\n\"It's heartbreaking to see people in the back of ambulances waiting. \n\"We know that patients aren\u2019t getting great care in the back of an ambulance parked outside the hospital. \n\"And we also know there's another patient somewhere else that needs that ambulance outside their house.\"\nDr Evans said ambulance crews were enormously stressed by the situation.\n\"The best way is to try and not take a patient hospital if they don't need to go,\" he says.\nTabbitha has worked in the control centre in South Queensferry for more than a decade.\nShe said it\u2019s tough to deal with calls when she can see ambulances caught up waiting to discharge patients at A&E departments.\n\u201cFor patients it means we're delayed getting to them,\" she says.\n\"We've got no resources to send when they phone because crews are sitting with our last patient waiting to hand over to the hospital.\"\nShe believes the problem is down to capacity issues across the NHS and she has seen demand on the ambulance service grow \"exponentially\".\n\"I can remember when I started, being a call-taker on a night shift and at midnight being the only call-taker in Edinburgh.\n\"The demand now has increased so much.\"\nParamedic Danni Pagliarulo responds first-hand to emergency calls across Edinburgh. \nShe works closely with hospitals and social care teams to work out the best treatment routes for the patients she sees.\n\"We try to put patients on pathways where they will receive the right care,\" she says. \n\"Whether that may be another route to hospital, we have direct access with oncology, palliative and end-of-life care and we have community pathways like Hospital at Home.\n\"There\u2019s social care, mental health services, drug and alcohol services in place for patients.\n\"We\u2019re all adapting. Healthcare is ever changing and the ambulance service has to adapt with that.\n\"Regardless of the pressures and demands we are under or the hospitals are under it should be the norm. It\u2019s about getting the right care.\"",
    "The second most senior officer at Merseyside Police discriminated against a \"strong professional woman\" who ran an elite anti-gang unit, a tribunal ruled. \nThe force's current deputy chief constable, Chris Green, was described as being \"out to get\" Det Ch Supt Emily Higham and had the \"exemplary officer\" investigated by the anti-corruption unit. \nDet Ch Supt Higham, and her personal assistant Tracey Bocking, were then \"unfairly\" removed from their \"prestigious\" roles at the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (NWROCU).\nThe force said it was appealing the judgment and could not comment while proceedings were ongoing. \nDet Ch Supt Higham settled her claim, but employment judge Gary Tobin found that Ms Bocking had been discriminated against on the basis of sex, and constructively, unfairly dismissed when she was \"caught in the crossfire\". \nThe tribunal heard the animosity between the senior officers began in 2020, when DCC Green was an assistant chief constable with strategic oversight of NWROCU. \nDet Ch Supt Higham had been seconded from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to manage the elite unit, comprising officers from forces across the North West.\nMerseyside had been agreed as the lead force for NWROCU, with Det Ch Supt Higham answerable to its top brass despite remaining an employee of GMP. \nMs Bocking said the experience had affected her health. describing it as a \"blatant case of misogyny\" and \"abuse of position\" by a male police officer. \nJudge Tobin ruled that the body responsible for answering the claim was GMP as her employer, although the discrimination was carried out by Merseyside officers. \nHe described ACC Green\u2019s decision to remove Det Ch Supt Higham from her role, which he had occupied before a promotion, as \"inexplicable and arbitrary\". \n\"We can see no other motives than the alleged sex discrimination\", he wrote.\n\"ACC Green could not deal with, or somehow felt undermined by, strong professional women in his former leadership role.\"\nThe tribunal heard problems began after a meeting early in 2020, when Det Ch Supt Higham told ACC Green that she felt \"suffocated\" by his management style. \nHowever, she regretted raising her concerns because after that conversation he \"took away her decision making\" and \"humiliated her\" at meetings by \"talking over her\" and \"speaking to and about her disrespectfully\".\nThe tribunal also heard she was bombarded with \"excessive\" meeting requests from ACC Green which clashed with pre-booked time off and childcare commitments.\nThe tribunal heard that in January 2021, ACC Green saw an \"innocuous\" email from Ms Bocking to her boss amd used it as an \"excuse\" to get rid of them both from NWROCU. \nMs Bocking had suggested to Det Ch Supt Higham that they use the code-name \"Jon Rooke\" to block out time in her electronic diary, to avoid excessive meetings. \nACC Green \"took offence\" and showed the email to Merseyside's then-deputy chief constable Serena Kennedy, who has since become the force's chief constable. \nHe suggested it amounted to \"dishonesty\", although no actual bookings had been made and Det Ch Supt Higham had not responded to the email. \nMs Kennedy was also criticised by the tribunal for the \"extraordinary\" decision to forward the email to anti-corruption detectives without ever speaking to Det Ch Supt Higham or Ms Bocking.\nThe tribunal said it was \"concerned\" with her evidence during the case, and Judge Tobin said DCC Kennedy's decision to \"throw her lot in\" with ACC Green was \"clearly an error\".\n\"This may have been to support the chain of command or because she did not want her force to lose face to Greater Manchester Police, or perhaps out of misplaced loyalty to a close colleague,\" he wrote.\nMs Bocking was sent back to GMP, but the tribunal found it had \"failed to stand up for her\" and left her \"in limbo\" as the grievance process dragged on.\nShe eventually resigned and took a job at the National Crime Agency in January 2023.\nDet Ch Supt Higham settled her claim, whereas Ms Bocking took the force to trial. \nThe tribunal ordered the parties to attempt to resolve the case between them. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The spire of a famous Gothic cathedral in the French city of Rouen caught fire, prompting an evacuation, local officials say.\nImages posted on X by the prefecture show black smoke billowing from a canopy and scaffolding at the top of the building, which is about 150m (495ft) tall.\nThe blaze has now been contained, according to officials, and three workers suffered from mild smoke inhalation.\nBuilders renovating the cathedral spotted the flames around the spire shortly after midday, sounding the alarm, according to local authorities.\nAbout 70 firefighters and 40 fire engines were part of the efforts to tackle the blaze at Our Lady of the Assumption cathedral, fire brigade chief Stephane Gouezec told local media.\nPlastic parts of the construction site caught fire, Mr Gouezec said. The metal spire itself did not appear to be damaged.\nMayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol said that \"all public resources\" had been mobilised in response.\n\"Fire broke out at the tip of the spire, which isn't made of wood, but rather metal,\" the prefecture of the Seine-Maritime department told AFP news agency.\nThe cathedral was evacuated and a security perimeter put in place while emergency services tackled the fire, the prefecture said.\nThe Archbishop of Rouen told Reuters he was relieved that four people working on the spire managed to get away from the flames, adding that one of the workers told him: \"I don't think I've ever been that close to the good Lord but today, I say thank you.\"\nRouen cathedral, featured in several 19th Century artworks by impressionist artist Claude Monet, is undergoing extensive restoration. \nIt was constructed over several centuries, with parts of the building dating back more than 900 years to the 12th Century, according to its official website. Between 1876 and 1880, it was the tallest building in the world.\nIn 2019, a blaze in the wooden roof frame caused massive damage to the world-famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. The landmark building in France's capital is due to reopen officially in December, after years of repairs.",
    "A landlord who commissioned a painting of a bull on the side of his 17th Century pub has been threatened with legal action by a council.\nMartin Peel, the owner of The Bull's Head in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire, was told by Stratford-upon-Avon District Council that the 8ft mural of a Herefordshire bull breached planning rules for listed properties.\nMr Peel now has four weeks to paint over the \u00a31,200 mural before facing legal action.\n\"They told me it was a criminal act as I didn't have planning permission. I feel quite naive about that now,\" he said.\n\"I was naive not to realise painting also came under planning. That is the truth. I lived in Asia for 20 years and have never owned a property in the UK.\"\nThe landlord, who has run the Grade II listed pub for three years, said that the council told him he could not apply for retrospective planning permission for the mural.\nHe has now consulted with a local planner, instructed lawyers to investigate appealing against the decision, and has launched a petition for the council to allow the mural to remain.\n\"We respect that the council has enough to do and lots of wonderful heritage in the area to protect, but we don't think we're doing anything to degrade this,\" he told the BBC.\nThe mural was created by Phil Taylor, an artist from Leamington Spa who has worked in the business for more than 40 years, and the artwork was completed in April.\nMr Peel said the mural was beautiful and \"really enhanced the pub\".\n\"Local customers who frequent the pub, they love it. They say it's put the pub back on the map,\" he said.\n\"The pub had been failing for a long, long time.

    "A man charged over the death of a 71-year-old woman at a slapping therapy workshop had promoted the practice as a \"cure\" for diabetes, a prosecutor said. \nHongchi Xiao, 61, of Cloudbreak in California, appeared at Winchester Crown Court today for the start of what was expected to be a three-week trial.\nHe was charged in November with manslaughter by gross negligence after the death of Danielle Carr-Gomm, 71 at a workshop in Seend, Wiltshire, on 20 October 2016, but pleaded not guilty.\nMr Xiao, the prosecution said, led Mrs Carr-Gomm - who had Type 1 diabetes - to believe insulin was a \"poison\" and that her condition could be cured through his therapy. \nProsecuting barrister Duncan Atkinson KC told the court how Mrs Carr-Gomm, from Lewes in East Sussex, was a committed vegetarian and had a fear of needles - both factors which had fuelled her years-long search for an alternative to insulin. \nShe initially met Mr Xiao, who was extradited from Australia before being charged by Wiltshire Police, at a Paida Lajin workshop in Bulgaria. \nTranslating to \"slap and stretch\", Paida Lajin is said to be a method through which \"poisonous waste\" is expelled from the body through patting and slapping parts of the body. \nDuring the workshop in Bulgaria, the prosecution said, Mr Xiao had assured Mrs Carr-Gomm he could help her with her diabetes. \nAt the same event Mrs Carr-Gomm stopped taking her insulin and became \"extremely unwell\", Mr Atkinson said, and had to be persuaded to start taking her medication again. \nThe court heard how in April 2015 Xiao had led a seminar in a suburb of Sydney, during which he described Paida Lajin as \"100% effective against Type 1 diabetes and that its healing effects meant it was no longer necessary to take insulin\". \nIn the public gallery were the parents of a six-year-old boy called Aiden who had died, and who had also had Type 1 diabetes. \nHis parents enrolled him in a workshop led by Mr Xiao, during which the boy became increasingly unwell with extreme symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis, which Mr Xiao claimed were simply \"part of self-healing body adjustment\". \nAfter Aiden's death, a \"direct consequence\" of not receiving his insulin\", Mr Xiao was convicted by an Australian court of manslaughter after telling the boy's mother to stop injecting him with the medication. \nThe court heard how on the first day of the workshop in Wiltshire, Mrs Carr-Gomm had announced she had stopped taking her insulin and had been congratulated by Xiao and others present for doing so. \n\"He knew that Mrs Carr-Gomm was risking death, and he knew that he had an influence over her decision,\" said Mr Atkinson. \n\"In short, therefore he chose to congratulate a diabetic who stopped injecting, rather than to persuade them not to take so grievous a risk to their life.\" \nAlongside other attendees Mrs Carr-Gomm began to fast, but soon fell seriously unwell, \"tired\", \"weak and \"howling in pain\" by day three. \nMr Atkinson said Mr Xiao was \"involved\" in her care and \"thus had repeated opportunities to see and advise her\", but there is no evidence he told her to take her insulin or call for medical assistance. \nBy day four, Mrs Carr-Gomm had died of diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\"He assumed a position of leadership and control over Mrs Carr-Gomm and her care as she declined and died, and owed her a duty, which he failed to meet, to help and care for her,\" Mr Atkinson said. \nThis, he summarised, \"substantially contributed\" to her death and \"amounted to gross negligence\".\nThe trial continues. \nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Sir Keir Starmer has insisted he remains committed to giving MPs a free vote on assisted dying laws at some point.\nThe prime minister said he would provide parliamentary time for a vote if a backbench MPs proposed changing the law, but stressed the government had other \"priorities for the first year or so\".\nFree votes are where MPs can vote based on conscience rather than having to follow a party line.\nSir Keir supported a change in the law the last time the issue was voted on in the Commons nine years ago and the cause has been championed by broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen.\nDame Esther is terminally ill with lung cancer and last year revealed she had joined Dignitas, the assisted dying clinic in Switzerland.\nSpeaking on a trip to the NATO summit in the US, the new prime minister was asked whether he would hold the vote in the first year of his government.\nSir Keir replied: \"What I said was that we would provide time for this by way of a private member's bill, and there will be a free vote.\n\"That remains my position for the reasons I've set out, having probably got more experience on this than most people, having personally looked at tens of cases in my time as director of public prosecutions.\n\"As to the timing of it, I haven't made a commitment on that and I don't want to.\n\"I'm not going back on the commitment I made, it's just we have got to set out priorities for the first year or so, but I will double down on the commitment that we are going to do that, we will allow time for a private member's bill, and there will be a free vote.\"\nAssisted suicide - intentionally helping another person to end their life - is banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. \nWhile there is no specific offence of assisted suicide in Scotland, euthanasia is illegal and can be prosecuted as murder or culpable homicide.\nTrying to kill yourself is not by itself a criminal act.\nA bill to legalise assisted dying in the UK was defeated in 2015, but was backed by Sir Keir and several Tory cabinet members.\nHe has previously said he thinks \"there are grounds for changing the law\".\nOpponents to changing the law say it is to protect the vulnerable and ensure that nobody is pressured into dying sooner than they might otherwise.\nOver 200,000 people signed a petition for a vote on assisted dying, leading to a debate in Parliament in April.\nThere was no vote and the government remains neutral on the issue.\nMany shared stories related to losing relatives and loved ones, and how it informed their view on the topic of assisted dying.\nA private member's bill (PMB) is a proposed law change introduced by an MP, not the government.\nPMBs rarely become law without the support of government, as they do not get the same amount of time dedicated to government businesses.\nFree votes are common on matters to do with health, religion or military intervention.",
    "A Russian attack on a power facility in Ukraine has left 100,000 people without power in the north-eastern region of Sumy.\nWork is under way to restore power, National grid operator Ukrenergo said, following the strikes, which caused emergency shut-offs for consumers in the city and region of Sumy, which borders Russia.\nThere were no reports of casualties or damage apart from the energy facility, Reuters reports.\nRussia continues to pummel energy facilities across Ukraine, often plunging the country into extended blackouts with people enduring sweltering summer conditions without running water, air conditioning, or life-saving medical equipment.\nOver the past three months alone, Ukraine has lost nine gigawatts of generating capacity, the national energy company Ukrenergo says, losing all of its thermal power plants to enemy action and seeing all hydroelectric sites damaged by drones or missile strikes. \nThis is enough to power the whole of the Netherlands during peak hours of consumption, and more than a third of the capacity Ukraine had before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began in February 2022, according to the national grid operator.\nPoland has been diverting surplus electricity to Ukraine to help it cope with the Russian strikes, but Ukrenego has scheduled cut-offs of electricity throughout the day across the country as domestic generation and electricity imports could not cover the deficit.\nMaria Tsaturian from Ukrenergo told the BBC she is aware that a lot of anger is directed at her company for cutting electricity so often, for so long and for so many customers. But, she says, there's no other option.\n\"We are at war. The energy sector is one of the goals for the Russian terrorists. And it is obvious why: all our life, all our civilisation, is built on electricity,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThis is the price we pay for freedom.\"\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian air defences shot down 24 out of 27 Shahed kamikaze drones Russia launched on the night of 5-6 July, the Air Force Command has reported on Telegram.\nThe drones were intercepted over areas including the Sumy region, using electronic jamming and anti-air defences, it said.",

    "\u201cOh god! We\u2019ve got a Labour government!\u201d A delighted member of the Cabinet told me reality only finally hit them when driving through their constituency on Friday, more than a week after voters sent the Tories packing.\nIn the prime minister\u2019s first seven days he\u2019s been confronted with a deeply awkward situation abroad \u2013 President Joe Biden\u2019s competence dominating the NATO summit. \nAt home the justice secretary has felt compelled to plan early prisoner releases (it\u2019s unusual a politician would make a willing choice to do that), and doubts over the survival of the steel plant in Port Talbot linger.\nIn other words, Labour is already grappling with the tasks government requires them to do \u2013 not the options they would choose.\nBut on Wednesday their own plans will take centre stage, with all the fuss and fanfare Westminster can summon \u2013 the attendance of the King, the giant golden throne (yes, really!), the trumpets, the frills and flounces.\nThe first \u2018King\u2019s Speech\u2019 will list the law the government hopes to pass in its first year of what Labour already hopes will be a decade in charge.\nDo not expect Labour\u2019s plans to include fireworks \u2013 no rabbits out of fancy hats. \nAnother Cabinet minister said: \"\u2018We are still in the mode of no surprises, to do the job we are hired to do.\u201d\nThe speech, however, will be absolutely stuffed with plans. Ministers have vied with each other to get their proposals in. \nThe message, I\u2019m told, has been to do the work, get your stuff ready, and the sooner you can do that, the more likely you are to get a slot for it.\nThe speech will be \u201crooted in Keir\u2019s missions\u201d, another source said \u2013 those \u201csix first steps\u201d that we heard about so much in the election. \nIn case you can\u2019t quite remember what they all were (like the now Health Secretary, Wes Streeting), you can refresh your memory here.\nWednesday is the start of a drawn-out process of passing at least 30 bills. It will include a couple of dozen new laws, and completing some unfinished business from the old government, as Labour starts to translate its manifesto into new life.\nTop of the list is getting the economy growing - No 10 and 11\u2019s priority. So expect plans to shake up the planning system, encourage house building, and more powers for the government\u2019s budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.\nLook out for plans to create Great British Energy, the government\u2019s energy company, to expand workers\u2019 rights, to create the National Wealth Fund - using the power of the public purse for long term investment - and to grant new powers to authorities round the country away from Westminster in the Take Back Control bill (get it?).\nThere are likely to be two new bills from the Home Office - a border security bill so people smugglers can be treated like terrorists and a crime bill to tackle antisocial behaviour and county lines drug trafficking.\nPlans to reform the Mental Health Act have been promised. Moving the rail industry into public ownership, votes for 16-year-olds and changes to the House of Lords have also been mooted.\nRishi Sunak\u2019s smoking ban is expected to be followed through, along with the former government\u2019s vow to end no fault evictions, and to bring in \u2018Martyn\u2019s Law\u2019 - legislation to force venues to be prepared for terror attacks, named after one of the victims of the Manchester Arena tragedy. Plans to strengthen the regulation of AI are on the way too.\nMinisters are under strict instruction not to be categoric about what has made the cut and what has not - even privately. \nA huge amount of work for the speech was done before Labour\u2019s election win was secure, but the protocol is that these announcements are the monarch\u2019s to make.\nSo until the day itself, we cannot be completely sure if some of the more controversial plans have been passed over this time. \nBe alert too to the promise of \u201creviews\u201d or \u201cconsultations\u201d. Sometimes taking a good look at a problem before new laws is the logical thing to do \u2013 on other occasions, it is a way of placating those arguing for action when ministers aren\u2019t quite ready.\nIf an idea hasn\u2019t made it into the speech this time around, it doesn\u2019t mean it will never happen. Governments are always able to put forward other laws at a later date. \nBut the speech is the government\u2019s formal to-do list, so Wednesday\u2019s priorities are the government\u2019s priorites.\nRemember, Labour is in a hurry to show they can get things done. Lots of effort has gone in to draft laws that are \u201ctight\u201d and \u201cworkable\u201d I\u2019m told, and are \u201dwhole Parliament proof\u201d \u2013 meaning laws that can get through the House of Lords.\nThe government has a ginormous majority in the House of Commons, but they have a different audience on the red benches at the other end of the Palace of Westminster. \nThey don\u2019t want to be picking time-consuming fights with the Lords, or creating laws that could be gummed up with hundreds of possible amendments \u2013 helpful tweaks - from their lordships.\nWednesday will be a huge moment. \nThe buglers will bugle.

This cleared the path for a new face, resulting in an uncontested selection.\nSome unexpected developments in the past six-seven months had fast-tracked Gambhir\u2019s candidature. \nLast November, he unexpectedly resigned as mentor of IPL franchise Lucknow Super Giants after guiding them to the knockout stages in two previous seasons. Instead, he reunited with his former IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), where he had previously led them to titles in 2012 and 2014 as a captain.\n\nIn March, Gambhir, who joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after retiring from cricket in 2018 and was elected MP for East Delhi in the 2019 general election, informed the BJP leadership of his decision to leave politics to fully dedicate himself to cricket once again.\nHowever, his credentials to be head coach of the national team received tepid attention until KKR hit a purple patch winning several matches on the trot and  turned the focus on him.\nThe process of selecting a chief coach is complex. \nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announces a call for applications through the media, inviting candidates from India or abroad who meet specific eligibility criteria (like played 30 Tests or 50 ODIs, under 60 years old). \nApplications are reviewed by the Board\u2019s Advisory Committee (CAC). Shortlisted candidates are then invited for one-on-one interviews to present their vision for advancing Indian cricket.\nThe candidate who puts forward the most impressive strategies and processes is picked for the job.\nIn Gambhir\u2019s case, the absence of any rival made the task of the CAC a no-brainer.\nAfter the BCCI\u2019s notice seeking applications for the post, stories about some overseas coaches being approached informally (likely self-instigated) began swirling around, but died a quick death.  \nUnlike in the past, when an overseas coach was sought to counter factionalism, favouritism, and parochialism in Indian cricket, today's preference is for an Indian coach who better understands the country's ethos, culture, and psychology.\nFormer India opener W Raman, who has coached the Indian women\u2019s team, did express interest in taking up the assignment. His CV was impressive, but at 59, he perhaps sensed he didn\u2019t have time on his side to build up a three-year game-plan that would get a buy-in from the BCCI and held back.\nGambhir's successful mentorship of KKR to an IPL triumph made him the frontrunner. With Dravid's firm stance during the T20 World Cup that he wouldn't continue, Gambhir's appointment became inevitable.\nHis appointment isn't without merit though. Beyond his IPL success, he has impressive credentials as an India player. A stylish left-handed batsman, he debuted in 2003 and is one of India's most accomplished openers with stellar performances across all formats.\nFor instance, in 2009, against New Zealand in the second Test at Napier, Gambhir batted 436 balls to score an epic 137 that helped India save the match after being forced to follow on. This knock helped India win the series.\nTwo years earlier, in the final of the inaugural T20 World Cup final against Pakistan, Gambhir was the top scorer with 75. Similarly, in the 2011 ODI World Cup final against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium, he top-scored with 97.\nIn 2012, after India had lost 0-4 to Australia in a Test series, Gambhir was projected to succeed M S Dhoni as captain, but missed out after Board President vetoed the selectors. Feisty and blunt, Gambhir's intense, unsmiling demeanour has often led critics to see him as unapproachable.\nOn his part, Gambhir claims he decries the focus on stars rather than star performances in Indian cricket. He believes the brand value of a few players shouldn't overshadow the intrinsic betterment of Indian cricket.\nThe head coach of India is among the most coveted jobs in the sport, guaranteeing, apart from enormous prestige and power, a lip-smacking pay package in excess of $1m per year plus bonuses. But in a cricket-crazy country, this does not come without great burden of responsibility and humongous pressure of expectation, , more so now after the huge successful tenures of his predecessors Rahul Dravid, and before him, Ravi Shastri.\nFor the next three years, India has a busy calendar - it will participate in the Champions Trophy this year, the World Test Championship next year, the T20 World Cup in 2026 and the ODI World Cup in 2027, along with bilateral assignments. \nGambhir must manage dressing room superstars, oversee generational transitions, and implement changes in mindset, strategies, and skills to maintain and enhance India's position in cricket.\nBeing head coach i",
    "A football superfan tattooed with passport stamps from attending England away games said he was \"always the optimist\" ahead of travelling to Germany on Saturday.\nIan Odgers, 56, from Dereham, Norfolk, said he had not missed a national home game in 14 years or an away friendly or qualifier match in more than a decade.\nThe production planner's dedication to supporting England has propelled him into the  FA's highest tier of fans, a group known as the \"top cappers\", who can mostly get guaranteed tickets.\n\"We describe ourselves as the 'same old faces, different places',\" Mr Odgers said while preparing to cheer on the team in Dusseldorf for the Euros quarter-final.\n\"There is always a shared respect of everyone doing the same thing as you,\" he said.  \n\"Coming from different parts of the country, taking different routes across Europe to ultimately do the one thing we love - which is supporting the country.\"\nMr Odgers, who works in Thetford, said Saturday's match would be his fourth international trip of the tournament - with the mood noticeably different so far. \n\"There's a negative vibe on the terraces,\" he said.\n\"All of the England fans are just waiting for something to click, but I'm always the optimist.\"\nHis hopeful outlook has been cemented by the fact that he has already booked all his flights and accommodation for England's potential whole championship run. \nThe grandfather, who has six children between himself and wife Ria, said he had spent hours meticulously planning his travel and annual leave from work once the fixtures were announced. \nTo keep costs down he flies the cheapest routes on budget airlines, arriving at destinations miles from busy stadiums before catching buses and trains before returning the next day - sometimes going straight to work from the airport.\nThe keen traveller, who has visited almost 70 countries and has set up an aid charity for refugees and people in need, said he enjoyed planning the logistics of getting to and from matches and mostly stayed in cheap accommodation including with local families.\nMr Odgers' passion for England was ignited when he attended his first game at the age of 12, before making it his life's ambition to follow the side.\nHe estimated he had travelled to more than 20 countries as a supporter at about 60 matches overseas - and started documenting his football trips with a series of tattoos about five years ago.\nHowever, he admitted it was getting harder to follow the team around. \n\"It's a combination of planes, trains and automobiles,\" said Mr Odgers.\n\"The energy side is taking its toll - I'm often asking people what day of the week it is.\n\"I'm not the same youthful man I was 20 years ago... but any England fan will tell you, it's the best hobby in the world.\"\nAnd as for the tattoos, Mr Odgers said if England managed a place in the Euros final, he would duly replicate the German passport stamp to celebrate the trip to Berlin.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A play by George Bernard Shaw that was banned on its release 130 years ago will be adapted at the playwright's former home on his birthday.\nA \"fresh perspective\" of Mrs Warren\u2019s Profession will be performed by the theatre company SHAW2020 at Shaw's Corner, Ayot Saint Lawrence, near Welwyn, on 26 and 27 July.\nWhen it was written in 1893, it was banned and when it was first performed in New York in 1905, all the actors and crew were arrested - but later released without charge, director Jonas Cemm said.\n\"It delves into the complex relationship between mother and daughter and the moral societal expectations of the day and the hypocrisy surrounding prostitution,\" he said.\nThe renowned Irish playwright, known for his works Pygmalion and Saint Joan, lived at Shaw's Corner for more than 40 years from 1906.\nHe died in November 1950 at the age of 94. His ashes were scattered in the gardens. \nThe Hertfordshire estate is now a National Trust property.\nBut Mr Cemm said the provocative play was \"possibly one of his greatest\", and was \"banned because of the controversy\".\nThe play was later performed for the first time in England in 1925. \nThe company said it had changed the timeline of the show to the 1930s \"where women continued to struggle against a patriarchal, capitalist society, offset by a sense of twentieth-century empowerment on the horizon\".\n\"Shaw\u2019s biting social commentary and witty observations make this ground-breaking play as relevant today as it has always been,\" the company added. \nRebecca Whitmore, house manager at Shaw\u2019s Corner, said: \"There has been a long tradition of performances in the garden at Shaw's Corner over Bernard Shaw's birthday weekend, dating back to when the great man was still alive and living at his country home.\"\nShe said she was \"delighted\" to be bringing the work \"to the lawn at Shaw's Corner on what would have been Shaw's 168th birthday\".\nThe adaptation is sponsored by the Shaw Society and its vice president, Dame Si\u00e2n Phillips, will be speaking at a fundraiser at the Palladian Church in Ayot on 27th July, ahead of the performance at Shaw\u2019s Corner.\nThe show will then move to Campus West theatre, Welwyn Garden City, on 28 July. \nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Justin Bieber has become the latest in a string of international stars to perform for the son of India's richest man and his wife-to-be as they celebrate their upcoming wedding.\nThe Canadian singer flew in to perform for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant - along with their guests - in Mumbai at the weekend.\nHe had a lot to live up to. The couple's first pre-wedding party featured Rihanna, while the second - a cruise around the Mediterranean - had performances from 90s teen heartthrobs The Backstreet Boys, singer Katy Perry and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.\nSo it is with bated breath that Ambani wedding-watchers - of whom there are now legions around the globe - await news of who will perform at the actual wedding itself this weekend.\nRumours swirling on the internet suggest it could be Adele, but the family are remaining tight-lipped.\nNo expense is being spared on the wedding of Mukesh Ambani's youngest son, putting it in a different league from even the most extravagant of Indian weddings. It outshines even his daughter\u2019s nuptials, which featured a headline-grabbing performance by Beyonc\u00e9.\nLast weekend Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant celebrated their sangeet ceremony - a night of music and dance ahead of the wedding ceremony. In typical style, the Ambanis went above and beyond what would usually be expected by guests.\nIt saw Mukesh Ambani, the head of Reliance Industries, with an estimated net worth of $115bn, according to Forbes, and the rest of the family take to the stage in their own choreographed dance to Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s hit song, Deewangi Deewangi.\n\nIt was also another chance for wedding-watchers to pore over the outfits worn by the guests - which included some of India's most glamorous stars wearing dresses by the country\u2019s top fashion designers. \nIt seems as much as the pre-wedding events have been concerts, they have also become catwalks, with stars sharing professional shots on their social media accounts ahead of the parties.\nThe cost of the three parties to date is not known. It was rumoured Rihanna had been paid $7m (\u00a35.5m) for her performance, while the figure suggested for Justin Bieber is said to be $10m.\nExactly what the weekend's three-day event holds remains to be seen. For some in India, it will come as a relief that the wedding and its extravagance is over, while those in Mumbai will be hoping it does not make the city\u2019s famously bad traffic any worse.\nRadhika was keeping her cards close to her chest when she told Vogue US last month that planning was \"going great\", adding: \"I\u2019m very excited to be married.\"",

    "The government will no longer defend a decision, made by the previous government, to allow a controversial new coalmine in Cumbria.\nThe new Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Angela Rayner, has accepted there was an \u201cerror of law\u201d in the decision to grant planning permission for the mine in December 2022.\nConsequently, the government will not now be defending two legal challenges next week against the mine \u2013 by Friends of the Earth and South Lakes Action on Climate Change (SLACC).\nIt has instead informed the court that the decision to grant planning permission should be quashed.\nBBC News has contacted West Cumbria Mining, the company behind the proposed mine, for comment.\nThe mine has been heavily criticised by climate campaigners and the government\u2019s independent advisors on climate.\nTwo legal challenges over the climate impacts of burning the coal will be heard at the High Court in London next week.\nIt comes after the court ruled in June that permission for an oil drilling project in Surrey should not have been granted because the climate impacts of burning the fossil fuels had not been considered.\nThe government referred to that ruling in its decision on Thursday to withdraw support.\nWest Cumbria Mining wants to build the UK\u2019s first deep coal mine in over 30 years. It would produce metallurgical coal, also called coking coal, for use by the steel industry.\nAt full production it would produce 2.78 million tonnes a year.\nThe company claims it would create 500 highly-skilled jobs with up to 1,500 more in the supply chain.\nBut critics argue it is at odds with the UK\u2019s commitments to radically reduce the amount of warming gases like carbon dioxide it produces that contribute to climate change.\nThe government has signed up to not add any more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050, and reduce emissions by 68% by 2030.\nChris Stark, the former head of the Climate Change Committee, which monitors the government\u2019s record on climate, criticised the decision to allow the mine to go ahead.\nIn 2021 he said the mine \u201cwill increase global emissions and have an appreciable impact on the UK\u2019s legally binding carbon budgets\u201d.\nCampaigners against the mine welcomed the news. Maggie Mason, who leads the South Lakes Action on Climate Change group, said: \u201cBuilding the mine on an old chemical site close to homes and the Irish Sea was also risky. West Cumbrians deserve jobs that don\u2019t cost the earth,\u201d she said.\nFriends of the Earth climate co-ordinator Jamie Peters said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted the government agrees that planning permission for this destructive, polluting and unnecessary coal mine was unlawfully granted and that it should be quashed. \n\"We hope the court agrees, and that the mine is then rejected when the secretary of state reconsiders the application.\n\u201cThe new government must now ensure that areas like West Cumbria get the jobs and investment they urgently need so that people living there can reap the benefits of building a clean, green and affordable future.\u201d\nThe High Court will now decide if the original planning decision should be overturned. \nAccording to Friends of the Earth, if the court rules next week that the decision was incorrect, the planning application will go back to the secretary of state to make a fresh decision.\nThe decision throws into doubt whether the coalmine will ultimately get the go-ahead.\n",
    "The drama and vitriol of France\u2019s sudden summer election is over. Now comes the drama and vitriol of stage two - and what could be a much longer and equally agitated struggle to build a functional coalition out of the inconclusive results of Saturday\u2019s vote.\n\u201cA lot of things are unclear. We know who lost but we don\u2019t know who won. Can we learn the art of compromise which is so unusual for us? Nobody knows - the signs are not necessarily good,\u201d Sylvie Kauffmann, a newspaper columnist for Le Monde, told me.\nThe risks of deadlock \u2013 for France itself, for its constitutional order, for European stability, and even for Ukraine\u2019s war against Russian aggression \u2013 are serious.\nBut it\u2019s worth remembering that this country is no stranger to coping with political upheavals. Revolutions aside, there was the chaos and revolts that followed World War Two and eventually upended France\u2019s constitutional order, leading to the current system of government, known as the Fifth Republic.\nAnd more recently there were the challenges of \u201ccohabitation\u201d, when presidents and prime ministers from rival parties were obliged to share power.\nAs politicians now sidle away for their summer holidays, or refocus their attention on the imminent Paris Olympics, it seems more than likely that the political temperature in France will subside by a degree or two, at least briefly.\nBut the cohabitation battles of the 1980s and 1990s look like gentlemanly squabbles over a wine menu compared with the furious, guillotines-at-dawn brawls that many observers expect to preoccupy France\u2019s National Assembly for weeks, or even months, to come.\nSome wonder if the French electorate \u2013 by saddling parliament with three minority blocks of almost equal size \u2013 has rendered the country \u201cungovernable,\u201d or whether it is simply faced with the sort of deal-making challenge that so many other European nations wrestle with almost as a matter of course.\nHaving emerged, to almost universal surprise, with the most seats at this parliamentary election, France\u2019s left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NPF) has now earned the right to pick \u2013 or try to pick - the next prime minister and to implement its agenda.\nBut with no working majority, any viable candidate will need to win support from other, more centrist parties. Who could possibly fit that bill?\nThe NPF was quick to unite around a common platform ahead of the elections. But it contains deep political rifts \u2013 stretching as it does from anti-capitalists and communists to mainstream social democrats. The coalition is also home to some divisive figures, like the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who could quickly trigger the coalition\u2019s collapse over the factionalism that has often marked the left of French politics.\nSome wonder if the Green Party leader, Marine Tondelier, might be a good fit. Her relatively low profile could be an asset in a political landscape scarred by years of deeply personal, and sometimes vitriolic, feuding.\nIn the midst of this, President Emmanuel Macron remains on his throne, scarred by self-inflicted political wounds, but arguably a little stronger than he was a few days ago.\nHis centrist grouping lost almost a third of its seats in the National Assembly as a result of his entirely unnecessary electoral gamble to dissolve parliament and call elections. But a disciplined frenzy of deal-making with the NPF helped it cling onto many more seats in the second round than the pollsters predicted.\nCould deadlock in parliament enable Mr Macron to float above the chaos and strengthen his position? Even his allies seem sceptical, convinced he is now trapped in a \u201cstranglehold\u201d between the extremes he once promised to banish from French political life.\n\u201cToday, the President of the Republic will maintain a small margin of manoeuvre to act. But he will no longer be the political programmatic driving force in the country. From this point of view, after seven years, Macronism is dead,\u201d Gilles Legendre, a disillusioned former MP who used to lead Macron\u2019s party in the Assembly, told the BBC.\nAs for the far-right National Rally (RN), it will no doubt recover quickly from the shock of Sunday night\u2019s results, which prompted sombre silence at the party\u2019s headquarters - a jarring contrast with the euphoric street celebrations by left-wing voters which swept through parts of Paris that same evening.\nThe RN has already sought to reframe its third-place disappointment as the result of cynical deal-making by a \u201cdishonest alliance\u201d of its rivals, rather than evidence of its own shallow pool of credible candidates and its failure to convince enough French voters of the sincerity of its move away from the extreme right.\nThe RN will surely try to promote its own agenda \u2013 including a clampdown on immigration and reforms of schools and policing. Its commitment to supporting Ukraine remains unclear, given the party\u2019s recent support for the Kremlin and its occupation of Crimea. The RN must now be hoping that the Assembly is ",

    "Two white-tailed eagles have taken a break from breeding to spend a year caring for their injured chick, leaving experts amazed.\nThe chick injured its left wing in July last year after its nest fell to the ground during unseasonably wild weather on the Isle of Mull.\nDespite the chick's sibling surviving the fall and leaving the nest last autumn, the injured bird's story has been a little less smooth.\nNow into its second year of life, the chick is relying on the help of its parents to stay fed and watered.\nDave Sexton, The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds(RSPB) Mull Officer, said the behaviour from the parents was \"quite extraordinary\".\n\u201cNormally chicks, when they fledge in the Autumn, take to the skies and head off. \n\"But this chick is still around for over a year now and it\u2019s just amazing that it\u2019s been looked after,\" he said speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland Programme.\nAfter the chick injured its wing, it was unable to fly for several week before making it back into the air in Autumn.\nIt was spotted in winter and again in spring this year by Mr Sexton, who was out doing a survey of nests at the time with local boat company Mull Charters.\nHe saw an adult bird fly to its nest with a fish, followed by the chick which he was surprised to see still begging for food.\nThe parents' unusual and caring behaviour has meant they have put their breeding on hold this year while they look after their chick.\nMr Sexton said: \"Quite often if eagles are injured, if a wing is broken that is normally it for that bird. \n\"But this one really has got the survival spirit and, with parents looking after it as well, we\u2019re hopeful that it might go on and survive much longer.\"\nMr Sexton says the RSPB are in \"uncharted waters\" after the discovery and they will be keeping a close eye on the bird.\n\"I\u2019ve checked with as many white-tailed eagles experts as I can and we\u2019re not finding any other examples of this anywhere else, so it seems to be new behaviour and we\u2019re watching it very closely.\"\nLike many parents, Mr Sexton believes the adult white-tailed eagles will start to lose patience with the chick in the years ahead.\n\"They do a lot of scavenging so if it finds a dead deer or seal along the shore it will have a meal there and it will cope I think. \n\"Whether it\u2019s able to hunt on its own is another matter,\" he said.\nThe chick is able to stretch both wings out and soar, but can't fly far at the moment.\nMr Sexton said it\u2019s \"sticking around\" with its parents and they are \"tolerating it\". \nThe chick is easily recognisable by its left wing which has a slight bend where the break happened.\nMr Sexton said he hopes the bird will survive through the winter.\n\"Whether we see it again, if it emerges next spring, well we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see but fingers crossed.\"",

    "Skye's first village in more than 100 years could become home to Gaelic speakers and learners.\nApplications have opened for 17 properties in Kilbeg in Sleat.\nThey have been built near Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig - Scotland's National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture - and the development is to have about 100 homes in total.\nThere is an expectation Kilbeg will attract Gaelic speakers, though the development is open to anyone who wants to live or work in the area.\nHighland councillors gave planning permission for Kilbeg in 2011 and construction started about two years ago.\nThe first properties - two affordable rent-to-buy homes built for Communities Housing Trust - already have two young families living in them.\nThe 17 new affordable homes include six for social rent with Highland Council, eight properties for sale and three discounted Communities Housing Trust self-build plots.\nOnce completed, the village would have a mix of discounted rent and sale family homes, level-access and wheelchair accessible homes.\nNearby are a primary school and nursery, medical centre and GP practice and a caf\u00e9.\nThere is a community shop about two miles away in Armadale.\nSabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig is one of the Kilbeg project's partners.\nChairman Angus MacInnes said: \"This new development is the perfect place to share the Gaelic language and culture across generations and it aligns closely with Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig\u2019s mission to promote the language through immersion, world-class education, research and cultural opportunities.\"\nCommunities Housing Trust chief executive Ronnie MacRae described Kilbeg as a ground-breaking community-led project. \nHe said: \"The development in Kilbeg is unique in Scotland, in that it will provide a model for a mix of ages and tenures, providing opportunities for older people and younger families to support each other which also takes into account the importance of culture and heritage. \n\"Repopulating and regenerating the area in this way makes sense and helps to ensure long-term future sustainability of the community.\"\nThe development has received public money including from the Scottish government\u2019s Rural and Islands Housing Fund, European Regional Development Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.\nSabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig marked its 50th anniversary last year.\nIn 2022-23, it had a record 1,600 student enrolments.\nThe number of people using Gaelic has increased across Scotland despite a decline in the language's heartland, according to the latest census data.\nExperts said an increase in Gaelic medium education (GME) accounted for the rise.\nHowever, the data suggested Gaelic was now a minority language in the Western Isles.\nIn 2011, 52% reported speaking Gaelic while the figure in 2022 was 45%.",
    "A drone was flown intentionally close to a glider and hit the aircraft as it was coming in to land, an investigation has found.\nThe glider's wing was damaged in the mid-air collision, but the pilot managed to land safely at Dunstable Airfield in Bedfordshire shortly after the incident on 7 October last year.\nVideo footage recovered from the drone showed it was deliberately flown towards  the glider and controlled from a car park at Dunstable Downs by a young operator accompanied by two adults, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said.\nBedfordshire Police told the BBC no report of the incident had been received by the force.\nAs the glider was preparing to land at the airfield at the foot of the Downs at about 17:00 BST, the pilot and passenger saw the drone pass close to the head of the passenger before hitting the left wing, the report stated.\nThe glider landed safely, and the damage to the Slingsby craft was later assessed as \"cosmetic\".\nThe glider pilot reported that the unmanned aircraft (UA) - the drone - was flown from a ridge, east of the airfield.\nThe drone was retrieved by two young people who shared its log and video footage with a witness. \nIt showed that the drone was flown on the direct approach path of the glider, and the glider was in view of its camera.\nImages of the drone were taken by the witness and given to the AAIB, which said in its report that the drone \"did not display an operator ID, nor was an ID reported to the AAIB\".\nIt stated that, under regulations, \"A UA is classified as an aircraft and the Air Navigation Order Article 241 states that 'a person must not recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property'.\"\nThe report concluded: \"The mid-air collision occurred because the UA was intentionally flown on the approach path of the glider. \n\"Operation of the UA required an operator ID, but the pilots were both too young to obtain one.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Massive floods have swept through swathes of India, Nepal and Bangladesh in recent days, killing scores of people and affecting millions of others.\nLarge-scale rescue operations are under way, with authorities directing thousands to shelters while sending food and supplies to those who are stranded.\nMajor rivers including the Brahmaputra and the Koshi, which flow through several countries, have overflowed their banks due to heavy rain.\nFloods and landslides are not uncommon during South Asia's monsoon season, when it receives up to 90% of its annual rainfall. \nBut experts say the issue has worsened in recent years due to climate change.\nOver the weekend in Nepal, authorities said 14 people had died since Thursday, with key highways blocked and some bridges swept away by swollen rivers. \nAuthorities estimate that this year's monsoon has killed more than 40 people so far. They have urged residents in the south-east of the country to be on alert as the Koshi river, which flows through Nepal and India, is flowing above the danger level.\n\"This is not new for us, but the timing is wrong,\" Kathmandu resident Rajkumar Bk told Reuters news agency.\n\"The flooding triggered by heavy rains started early this year, in July. The water level has reached up to our knees. If the rainfall continues the same way then we will have to run for our lives.\"\nIn the Indian state of Assam, about 2.4 million have been affected by floods while 66 people have died since mid-May. Officials have warned of even more rain with water levels in the Brahmaputra expected to increase in the coming days. \nRoads and vast areas of farmland have been submerged along the banks of the Brahmaputra, which flows through parts of India and Bangladesh, and other rivers.\nTelevision pictures in recent days showed villagers salvaging their belongings and leaving their inundated homes by boat. Several bridges and roads have been washed away, disconnecting remote villages. \nAssam's Kaziranga nature reserve, home to nearly 2,200 one-horned rhinos, was also under water. Four rhinos and scores of deer and other animals have died so far. Experts have said it is one of the worst incidents of flooding in recent years in terms of the number of animals killed. \nOn Monday, officials closed some schools in India's financial capital Mumbai as heavy rains overwhelmed some roads.\nIn Bangladesh, authorities said two million people have been affected by floods with at least eight people dead.\nThe overflowing Brahmaputra has inundated a quarter of the districts in the country.\n\"We live with floods here. But this year the water was very high. In three days, the Brahmaputra rose by 6ft to 8ft (2m-2.5m),\" Abdul Gafur, a local councillor in the district, told the AFP news agency.\n\"We are trying to deliver food, especially rice and edible oil.

    "Staffing levels in an hospital emergency department where a sick child waited for six hours without being seen by a doctor shortly before her death were \"unsafe\", an inquest has heard. \nMakenna-Rose Thackray died on 20 December 2022, less than 48 hours after her parents took her home from Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, where they had endured a fruitless wait for a clinical assessment. \nThe four-year-old, from Rothwell, had been taken to hospital by ambulance on 18 December after she vomited blood, having been diagnosed with scarlet fever earlier that month.\nNurse Helen Parker, who was on duty in the children's A&E on the night in question, said that evening had been \"one of the worst\" shifts she had known. \nGiving evidence on the second day of the inquest at Wakefield Coroner's Court, Ms Parker said she and the one other nurse on duty in the department saw 79 sick children between them across their shift on the night Makenna-Rose was admitted.\nThe inquest, which is being heard by a jury, was told two nurses could safely deal with between 30 and 40 patients between them.\nThe proceedings had earlier heard that patients in the children's A&E typically waited seven-and-a-half hours to be seen on the night in question.\nAsked by barrister Richard Copnall, who is representing Makenna-Rose's family, if the department's staffing levels were unsafe at that point, Ms Parker replied: \"Absolutely, yes.\n\"It is the situation of the NHS at the minute. We were very stretched.\n \"That night was probably one of the worst.\"\nThe inquest had previously been told Makenna-Rose had been diagnosed with scarlet fever, caused by the bacterial infection Strep A, on 9 December. \nThe disease causes a high fever and sore throat and can be dangerous in young children if left untreated.\nThere was a Strep A outbreak across the UK in late 2022, which Ms Parker said \"massively\" impacted the children's emergency department, with numbers \"rising daily\" up to the night Makenna-Rose was admitted. \nThe Mid Yorkshire Teaching NHS Trust, which runs Pinderfields, declared a major incident \"a couple of nights afterwards\", indicating huge waits in A&E, she said.  \nThe jury was told that Ms Parker observed Makenna-Rose and deemed her condition serious enough to be escalated to a doctor. \nHowever, the nurse said because the department was so busy and other children were deemed \"sicker\", she could not be assessed promptly. \nAlthough Makenna-Rose had a high temperature of 39.5C and was seen with dried blood around her mouth, she was described by Ms Parker as being \"very active and giggling\" while waiting to be seen.\nIn a statement previously read to the inquest, Makenna-Rose's mum, Danielle Ledger, said her daughter had been \"poorly, lethargic and burning up\" and that she got \"hotter\" as their wait in A&E continued. \nHowever, after waiting for six hours until 01:30 GMT and with the child increasingly \"exhausted\", the family decided to leave and visit a GP later that day.\nMiss Ledger said nurses at the hospital \"did not encourage me to stay\" when she self-discharged. \nBut Ms Parker said that she was concerned enough about Makenna-Rose's condition to suggest the family stay.\nShe told the court: \"I said I would have liked her to be seen by a doctor. \n\"I realised the situation was not ideal and I apologised for them not having been seen by a very long time, but I did encourage them to stay.\"\nGiving his evidence to the inquest, the GP who saw Makenna-Rose on 19 December said he had diagnosed her and her parents with flu and confirmed he did not prescribe antibiotics as a result.\nDr Nand Kishar Nemana told the jury he had not been made aware that the primary school pupil had been vomiting blood or had been taken to A&E by ambulance the previous night. \nHe said if he had known, he would have \"decided the child needs to be sent to hospital, because vomiting blood can't be taken lightly\". \nMakenna-Rose's parents were praised in court for their efforts to resuscitate their daughter as they waited for an ambulance to come to the family home when their daughter stopped breathing. \nJames Goulding, from the Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS), said he had listened to the recording of the couple's 999 call and told them: \"Your courage and bravery that day was incredible.\n\"The fact you had that presence of mind, you should be highly commended for that.\"\nMr Goulding told the court that YAS had declared a critical incident just hours before Makenna-Rose died, because it was \"completely overwhelmed that day\". \nHowever, the jury was told that paramedics had arrived at the scene within 11 minutes of the 999 call being answered, which Mr Goulding said was the \"fastest we could have responded at that time\". \nThe incident had been given Category One status - the highest priority type indicating an immediate threat to life - because Makenna-Rose had stopped breathing.\nThe inquest continues.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A British-Mexican man convicted of drug charges in Qatar has appealed against the verdict, saying the trial was unfair and that he was targeted because of his sexuality.\nManuel Guerrero Avi\u00f1a said he \u201cwas convicted because I am gay and that is a breach of my human rights\u201d. \nThe 44-year-old airline manager was arrested in February in a police sting through the gay dating app Grindr. His family says a small quantity of drugs were planted on him at the time. \nHe was given a six-month suspended sentence last month. Qatar has previously insisted Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a's case was solely about possession of drugs.\nIn a statement released after lodging his appeal, he described the verdict as unfair and said: \u201cI was convicted on the basis of an unjust trial, after facing torture and ill-treatment during my preliminary detention, and am appealing on that basis.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI urge the Qatari authorities to review my case and address the violations of due process, including torture to try to force me to name sexual partners, forced fingerprint signatures on Arabic documents, denial of legal and translation rights, and inhumane detention conditions for 44 days.\u201d\nHe called on the UK and Mexican governments to raise concerns with Qatari authorities about \u201cthese injustices\u201d.\nMr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a's family previously told the BBC that he was approached by a man on Grindr and in February arranged to meet the man at his apartment in Doha.\nHowever, when he went down to the lobby to meet the man, he was arrested by Qatari police officers \u2013 despite having no prior trouble with the authorities, they said.\nHis brother has claimed that Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a did not use drugs and that methamphetamine was planted on him \u2013 which he was then \u201cpressured\u201d into accepting was his.\nA Qatari official has previously insisted that his arrest was on the basis of possession of illegal substances and that \u201cno other factors were taken into account\u201d.\nThey said Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a had been treated with dignity and respect, and that a drug test had confirmed the presence of drugs in his system at the time of his arrest.\nBut Amnesty International last month described his treatment in custody and unfair trial as \u201cutterly horrific\u201d.\nIt urged the Qatari authorities to overturn his conviction and end \u201cthe discrimination and persecution of people based on their sexual orientation\u201d.\nHomosexuality is illegal in Qatar, with punishments including fines and prison sentences.\nJames Lynch, co-director of human rights organisation FairSquare, is a former UK diplomat in Qatar.\nHe said: \u201cManuel is determined to prove his innocence and we just have to hope that the Qatari appeal court takes a long hard look at all the deep flaws with the way his case was handled, from the start when he was targeted in a Grindr sting to the way he was denied his HIV medication in prison, to pressure him to put his thumb to a so-called confession.\u201d\nThe BBC has not been able to independently verify all of the claims made by Mr Guerrero Avi\u00f1a and his family \u2013 although previous reports suggest others have had similar experiences with the Qatari authorities.",

    "The Defence Secretary has said the UK is committed to a shared plan with the US and Australia to create a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.\nJohn Healey said the Aukus defence project was a \"fundamental\" part of the UK's future security, which would fuel economic growth.\nHe spoke as he toured a military steel supplier in Sheffield with Richard Marles, the Australian defence minister and deputy prime minister.\nThe submarine programme is expected to generate 7,000 additional British jobs.\nMr Healey, fresh from the Nato summit in Washington DC, visited Sheffield Forgemasters, which is owned by the Ministry of Defence, alongside his Australian counterpart.\nHe reaffirmed the UK's commitment to Aukus and emphasised its role in job creation.\nMr Healey said: \"Working with allies and partners is fundamental to our security and so it is a pleasure to host my Australian counterpart within my first fortnight as defence secretary.\n\"The UK and Australia are the closest of friends and our work through Aukus is testament to this.\"\nThe MP for Rawmarsh and Conisbrough, in South Yorkshire, added: \"Sheffield Forgemasters is a shining light of UK industry that helps boost global security and employs skilled staff from the local community.\n\"This is just one example of how our hugely important partnership with our Australian and American partners can help drive jobs and growth across Britain.\"\nThe visit comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer spoke to his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, with the leaders outlining their commitment to partnership.\nMr Marles has also visited HMNB Clyde, in Scotland, to see first-hand how the UK operates its nuclear submarine base. \nThe Aukus submarines are aimed at countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. \nThey would be able to operate further and faster than Australia's existing diesel-engine fleet, with the country capable of carrying out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time.\nUnder the deal, sailors from the Royal Australian Navy are due to be sent to US and UK submarine bases to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.\nFrom 2027, the US and UK will also base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia.\nCanberra is set to buy three US-model Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s, with an option to purchase two more.\nAfter that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies, which is known as SSN-AUKUS.\nThe craft would be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, using technology from all three countries.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Blackpink star Jennie has apologised after a video that showed her vaping indoors sparked a huge outcry in South Korea. \nThe K-pop star exhaled a puff of smoke - and triggered a barrage of criticism because it blew into the face of her make-up artist. \n\"Do you need to be educated for all the basic manners?\" a popular comment on YouTube reads.\nHer label OA Entertainment has apologised to \"everyone who felt uncomfortable with Jennie\u2019s actions\", and to her \"disappointed\" fans. The star has also apologised to staff \"who may have been affected\", the label said. \n\"Jennie acknowledges and deeply regrets her mistake of vaping indoors and causing inconvenience to the staff,\" it added.\nSouth Korean celebrities are no strangers to the intense scrutiny. The country holds them to rigid moral and behavioural standards and no misstep goes unnoticed. \nThe now-deleted moment was part of a video posted on Jennie's official YouTube channel. It quickly spread through the 10 million-plus subscribers and beyond. \n\"It's not about smoking. Blowing smoke in the face of the staff indoors - it's just rude,\" a top YouTube comment on a media outlet's channel reads.  \nAnother one says: \"Even smokers know that you don't puff on your friends' face. You only do it when you really don't care about the people around you.\" \nSmoking and vaping indoors is banned in South Korea and is punishable by a fine of up to \u20a9100,000 ($72; \u00a356). \nIn this case, however, Jennie - whose full name is Jennie Kim - might not have been vaping in South Korea. Some accounts suggest the video was filmed in Italy, which bans vaping in enclosed public spaces. But Jennie's agency has not clarified where she was at the time.  \nAnd yet, one furious South Korean has demanded an investigation from their  country's embassy in Italy and Seoul's ministry of foreign affairs.\nJennie is not the first South Korean celebrity to face a backlash over smoking. \nDoh Kyung-soo, vocalist for the popular K-pop boy band EXO  and Haechan, a singer in the band NCT, drew a lot of flak when they were caught smoking indoors.

    "A former Alliance Party assembly member breached Stormont's code of conduct in his actions towards an integrated school, a committee has found.\nPatrick Brown quit in April while a complaint from Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, County Down, was still being investigated by the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nA report by the standards and privileges committee has found his conduct brought the assembly into disrepute.\nMr Brown described the complaint as \"vexatious\" and said his reasons for quitting politics were \"to take up a new job\" and for \"personal health reasons relating to the pressures of the role\".\nThe complaint was made by the school's principal and the chair of its board of governors, and was investigated by the assembly standards commissioner, Melissa McCullough.\nMs McCullough's report was then considered by the standards and privileges committee, made up of members of the legislative assembly (MLAs).\nIt upheld four of the eight allegations against Mr Brown, who was an MLA for the South Down constituency.\nThe issues centred on Mr Brown complaining to the school about governance issues and his unsuccessful application to become a governor at the school.\nThe committee agreed with the commissioner\u2019s findings that Mr Brown had conflated his own personal interest with the public interest and had failed to resolve this conflict.\n\nIt found he used his MLA letterhead in communications about his complaint to \"improperly confer an advantage for himself\".\nThe committee also agreed with the commissioner's conclusions that Mr Brown had brought the assembly into disrepute by failing to observe principles of \"selflessness and objectivity\".\nSinn F\u00e9in assembly member Car\u00e1l N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn, chair of the committee, said they would have recommended an appropriate sanction to the assembly if Mr Brown had remained an MLA.\n\"It is important that members should at all times conduct themselves in a manner which will maintain and strengthen the public\u2019s trust and confidence in the integrity of the assembly and never undertake any action that would bring the assembly into disrepute,\" she added.\nAlliance did not expand on the reasons for Mr Brown's sudden departure as an MLA when it was announced by the party in April.\nIt later emerged he had been facing the standards watchdog probe.\nShimna college principal Steve Pagan thanked Ms McCullough and the committee for their work.\nHe said their priority \"remains the education and welfare of our students\".\n\"We look forward to moving on from this affair and focusing exclusively on the business of running and governing the college,\" he added.\nMr Brown said everything he did was \"in the interests of representing constituents\".\nHe said he applied to the board of governors \"as an MLA to help the school\" and \"not to benefit myself in any way\".\nMeanwhile, the standards and privileges committee has published reports on complaints against several former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) ministers.\nThey relate to 2021 when DUP ministers were boycotting North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings in protest over post-Brexit trade checks affecting Northern Ireland.\nThe standards commissioner found the DUP assembly members - Paul Givan, Gordon Lyons, Michelle McIlveen, Gary Middleton and Edwin Poots - had breached the ministerial code of conduct.\nMs N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn said current procedures do not provide the committee with an adjudication role relating to complaints against ministers.\nShe said it would be a matter for the assembly to consider whether there had been a breach of the code.\n",
    "Australian police have found human remains while searching for a 12-year-old they believe was the victim of a crocodile attack.\nThe child was last seen on Tuesday, swimming with family near the remote Aboriginal town of Nganmarriyanga - about a seven-hour drive southwest of Darwin in the Northern Territory (NT).\n\u201cThis is devastating news for the family, the community and everyone involved in the search,\u201d said Senior Sgt Erica Gibson, adding that police would provide support to everyone impacted.\nEarlier Sgt Gibson had told ABC News that a black crocodile had been seen in the immediate area.\nAs many as 40 members of the community helped police officers in their search for the child, which started shortly after the 12-year-old was reported missing. \nThey scoured the area by foot, by boat and with the use of helicopters, covering challenging terrain with thick vegetation and a narrow, winding waterway.\nNo details were given on whether the crocodile suspected to have attacked the child had been found.\nEarlier on Wednesday NT Police Minister Brent Potter said wildlife officers had been authorised to \"remove\" the crocodile from the area once it was located and reiterated the government's safety message.\n\"We live in a place where crocodiles occupy our water places... it's just a reminder to stay out of the water as best we can.\"\nFound all around the northern edges of Australia - from Broome in Western Australia to Gladstone in Queensland - saltwater crocodiles were hunted to near extinction but numbers have bounced back since the practice was banned in the 1970s.\nThe NT is now home to an estimated 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere else in the world. Attacks though are uncommon.\nThere have been at least two other crocodile attacks in the NT in the past year - a nine-year-old boy was injured in January while swimming in Kakadu National Park, and a farmer escaped a beast's jaws by biting it back in October - but there has not been a fatal attack there since 2018.\nQueensland, however, has had a series of deadly attacks in recent years, including a 16-year-old boy who was killed in the Torres Strait in April.",
    "When Rachel Reid's workplace began an active travel challenge, she dived in\u2014almost literally.\nWhile many of her colleagues cycled or walked at least part of their journey to work, she took to the River Lagan to paddleboard the five miles into Belfast.\n\"It's a nice way to get to work, it's sustainable, and it's a great way of combining exercise with your daily routine,\" she said.\nThe UK's Climate Change Committee advised the transport sector in Northern Ireland should have decreased emissions by 29% by 2030, to include an increased proportion of journeys made by walking and cycling.\nBut emissions from transport still contributed almost 18.1% of Northern Ireland's total in 2022.\nThis represents an increase of 7.1% since 1990.\nJoining the active travel challenge inspired Rachel to try a few different methods to get to work.\n\"I've got the bus a few times, I car-shared with my husband a couple of times and cycled quite a few times,\" she said.\n\"Then I've paddled three or four times in the last month.\"\nBut the statistics show that most people are still heavily reliant on cars.\nThe Department for Infrastructure carries out an annual travel survey and last December published the most recent figures, which are from 2021.\nIt found that, on average, every person in Northern Ireland makes more than 800 journeys a year, covering almost 5,000 miles.\nJust over two-thirds of those journeys are made by car.\nMore than a third were less than two miles long; half of them walked, half were driven.\n\"The statistics don't tell a very good story,\" said Anne Madden from the charity Sustrans.\n\"We'd really like to see more people take those short journeys by foot or cycle because we know it is possible, but there's a lot more that could be done to enable that, such as providing safe cycling infrastructure.\"\nMichelle Kelly, head of transport at the Consumer Council, believes consumers are \"aware\" of the need to reduce emissions.\n\"Many consumers are switching to more sustainable modes of transport,\" she continued.\n\"Having said that, I think more work needs to be done on making consumers more aware, move them away from aspiring to be greener in their travel choices and actually make them willing to sacrifice the reliance on private cars.\"\nFor Rachel, climate change is \"a big thing\" and by not driving her car every day, she feels she is doing \"a tiny little bit\" to help.\n\"For me mentally, it's just a lovely way to spend a couple of hours in the morning,\" she said.\n\"I feel like I'm on holiday for a couple of hours and then suddenly I'm in work.\"\nLet's be practical - paddleboarding to work isn't for everyone and it's certainly not possible in the dark months of winter.\nMuch of Northern Ireland is rural, so using some form of mechanical transport some of the time is largely inevitable.\nBut we are clearly very reliant on our cars.\nAnd while public transport is also a greener choice - more than 200 Translink buses are zero emission vehicles - it accounted for just 2% of journeys made in 2021.\nThat's part of a wider discussion around fare pricing and accessibility, but if we can make choices that involve doing even part of a journey on foot or by cycle, or possibly not making that journey at all, those individual actions are part of a bigger whole which helps contribute to reducing our overall emissions.",
    "Brazil has blocked Meta from using Brazilians' Instagram and Facebook posts to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models.\nIt comes weeks after the company abandoned similar plans to use UK and European users' posts for the same purpose.\nOn Tuesday, Brazil's national data protection agency (ANPD) said it would immediately suspend Meta's latest privacy policy, which allows it to train generative AI models such as chatbots based on posts from its users.\nA Meta spokesperson told the BBC the company was \"disappointed by the decision\", adding that their approach complied with local privacy laws.\n\"This is a step backwards for innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Brazil,\" the company added.\nMeta has a significant market in Brazil. There are 102 million Facebook users and more than 113 million Instagram users in the country.\nThe ANPD said it had acted over the \"imminent risk of serious and irreparable damage, or difficulty repairing fundamental rights of the affected [account] holders\". \nMeta was given five working days from ANPD's decision to show it has amended its privacy policy to exclude the use of personal information found in public posts to train generative AI. If it fails to comply it will face a daily fine of R$50,000 (\u00a36,935).\nThe company's updated policy was also the focus of scrutiny in the UK and the European Union (EU). \nUnder its privacy policy changes, which were due to take effect in the region on 26 June, Meta users' information would be used to \"develop and improve\" its AI products. \nIn Europe, the policy change would include posts, images, image captions, comments and Stories that users over the age of 18 had shared with a public audience on Facebook and Instagram, but not private messages.\nBut that was put on hold after Meta said it had received a request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) on behalf of other European stakeholders to delay its training of large language models (LLMs).\nLLMs are a type of artificial intelligence that powers chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. \nOn 14 June, when it announced the delay, Meta said this was a \"step backwards\" for AI in Europe.\nHowever Meta decided to press ahead with the policy change in Brazil.\nPedro Martins, from Data Privacy Brasil, welcomed the ANPD's decision. He told the BBC there was a discrepancy between Meta's data protection measures for its Brazilian and European users.\nMeta had planned to use posts from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, he said, while in Europe nobody under 18 would have their posts used.\nBrazil's data protection regulator also found that personal data found in children and teenagers' posts could be collected and used to train Meta's AI systems, which could be in breach of the country's data protection law.\nIn addition, Mr Martins said, in Europe the steps users can take to prevent Meta from using personal information are more straightforward than in Brazil, where he said it can take as many as eight steps for users to block the company from using their posts.\nThe BBC has asked Meta to respond to the claim that it had planned to use posts  from Brazilian children and teenagers to train its AI models, and whether it imposed more onerous steps for opting out on users in Brazil.

    "A mum says her plea for her tractor-loving son to arrive at school on his favourite mode of transport has had a \"phenomenal\" response from the community.\nRyan, 16, from Long Eaton in Derbyshire, is due to leave Stanton Vale School, a school for children with severe learning disabilities, after eight years. \nRyan's mother Sarah said he would be attending a leaver's assembly, rather than a \"prom\", on Thursday, and she has arranged for him to arrive on a tractor.\nSarah reached out for help on Facebook in an attempt to organise a \"special ride\" to the event, and was \"overwhelmed\" with the response. \nSarah said: \"Because Ryan's at special needs school, they don't go to a prom like at other schools, they just have a leaver's dinner, and Ryan asked me if he could have some nice transport to take him to his leaver's assembly.\" \nIn a quick attempt to make Ryan's hopes a reality, the 36-year-old posted anonymously in a Long Eaton Facebook group, offering to pay if a local business could help. \n\"Within an hour of our post, we'd had about 80 replies, numerous transportation offers; everything from tractors and motorcycles to horses to BMWs - its been phenomenal,\" she said. \nRyan was left with brain damage due to the poor care he received at Nottingham City Hospital as a newborn baby, which Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, later accepted responsibility for. \nSarah was told at the time that her son would never walk or talk, but he \"exceeded all expectations\", and will soon leave school with qualifications in English, maths, information technology and woodwork, before going to college.\nA tree surgeon firm, Maple Tree Care, based in Sandiacre, Derbyshire, offered to take Ryan to his leaver's assembly in a tractor and even take him for a drive after school on Thursday. \nManaging director Liam Webb said he had been tagged in the comments of Sarah's Facebook plea numerous times. \n\"I reached out to her and she told me about her son,\" he said. \"I told her we were happy to help, but we didn't want anything for it - it's not a problem for us.\" \nA biker group also offered to stage a convoy behind Ryan, Sarah said.\nShe added: \"I'm just bowled over by the local community. When you have a child with a brain injury, you just want them to feel as included as possible and do all the things that other children do. \n\"And going to the prom and going in a fancy car seems to be a huge thing these days - so it's been absolutely emotional craziness that this has happened, and I'm so grateful to every single person that offered to help him.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The first red post box with the cypher of King Charles III has been revealed by the Royal Mail.\nJulie Spence, the Lord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, unveiled the post box on High Street, Great Cambourne, Cambridgeshire, with the assistance of children from the Vine Inter-Church Primary School.\nThe pupils posted the first letters, which were handwritten notes to the King, into the freestanding stainless steel structure.\nThe King has granted the Royal Mail special use of his cypher, which is his personal property.\nThe King's cypher consists of his initial C, with the roman numeral III and an R for Rex - Latin for King - under a Tudor Crown.\nThe unveiling continues the 170-year-old tradition of stamping red post boxes with a royal cypher, which dates back to the reign of Queen Victoria.\nPost boxes are not replaced, therefore existing boxes will retain the cypher from the period in which they were installed.\nEmma Gilthorpe, the chief executive of the Royal Mail, said: \"We thank His Majesty for granting us the use of his personal cypher as we begin the next chapter in the story of the iconic Great British post box in Great Cambourne.\"\nAlthough some new or replacement post boxes have been installed since Charles acceded to the throne in 2022, the cypher of Queen Elizabeth II was still used to prevent wastage.\nThe new cypher will not be applied to new post boxes in Scotland, as since 1955 they have been distinguished by the St Andrews crown.\nThe King's cypher will also be applied to the Royal Mail's fleet of vehicles, an initial roll-out of 100 trucks will take place on Friday, with a further 290 over the next six weeks.\nIn total, 3,636 vehicles will be updated with the King's cypher between August and October this year.\nThe Royal Mail has recently announced a change in its brand logo, which is known as the cruciform.\nThe branding used on the company's vehicle livery, buildings, website and stationery, will now feature the rounded Tudor Crown used by the King, rather than the arched St Edward's crown used by the late Queen for her cypher.\nThe new logo will only be applied to new or replacement signage, stationery and vehicles to avoid unnecessary costs and waste.

    "Interest rates should be held again next month rather than be cut for the first time in more than four years, a Bank of England rate-setter has said.\nJonathan Haskel, a member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) which sets the UK's main interest rate, said he \"would rather hold rates\" at 5.25% until there is more certainty that inflation pressures had \"subsided sustainably\".\nInterest rates have been kept at a 16-year high in an attempt to slow consumer prices rising, but higher rates have pushed up the cost of borrowing, including for mortgages.\nThe Bank previously appeared to hint that rates could be cut in August after official figures showed inflation \u2013 which measures the pace of price rises \u2013 had slowed to 2%, which is in line with its target.\nThat, in turn, has led to some lenders dropping their mortgage rates slightly.\nFinancial markets have currently priced in a roughly 60% chance that rates will be cut next month for the first time since 2020.\nBut Mr Haskel, who voted in favour of holding rates in June, said he believed his fellow policymakers should remain cautious, citing concerns over the UK's job market and worker shortages.\nHe said while there were \"considerable encouraging signs\" on inflation falling, the rate would actually remain above 2% \"for quite some time\".\n\"The labour market continues to be tight, and I worry it is still impaired,\" he wrote in a speech due to be delivered later on Monday.\n\"I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably.\"\nSome mortgage lenders are factoring in a drop in the benchmark rate as part of wider considerations when setting the interest rates they charge on new fixed deals.\nThey also want to ensure they are competitive but not over-run by applications for mortgages which they then struggle to process.\nThe Nationwide and Virgin have become the latest to reduce rates, following other lenders in recent weeks. The former said it would cut rates by up to 0.3 percentage points on Tuesday.\nThe main UK interest rate also informs the rates High Street banks offer on savings accounts.\nThe average two-year fixed mortgage deal on Monday was 5.93%, while a five-year deal was 5.51%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts.\nThe average easy access savings rate was 3.11%.\nHigher borrowing costs have added to financial pressures on household budgets in recent years, which have been stretched by higher energy and food bills.\nThe Bank of England is independent of the government and its main role is to keep inflation stable at 2%.\nIn response to high inflation, the Bank in recent years has raised and then kept interest rates at a high level. The Bank has also forecast that inflation could tick up slightly again in the coming months.\nThe theory behind rising rates is that it will slow inflation, but it can also drag on economic growth as businesses may put off investment or hiring, which could mean fewer jobs being created.\nThe UK still has a lower percentage of people of working age in employment than before the Covid pandemic.\nInflation can be impacted by worker shortages, as it can lead to employers having to raise wages in order to attract and retain staff, which can in turn lead to prices for goods rising as businesses increase them to cover costs.\nMr Haskel is an external member of the Bank's MPC and also a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School.\n\"The playing out of those shocks through the economy, and the continued tight and impaired labour market, means that inflation will remain above target for quite some time,\" Mr Haskel wrote in his speech.\nHis term on the MPC is due to end on 31 August.",
    "A London fertility clinic that was stripped of its licence by inspectors after the \"tragic loss\" of some frozen embryos can reopen next month, the regulator has said.\nThe closure in March followed three \"serious untoward incidents\" in which a number of embryos in storage either did not survive being thawed or \"were not found\". \nThe incidents have been investigated and the regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), said it was now \"satisfied\" the clinic could resume treating patients from 8 August, providing it introduced actions set out by investigators.\nThe Homerton Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Homerton Fertility Centre in Hackney, said it could \u201cgive those assurances\u201d and apologised to patients affected.\nTrust chief executive Bas Sadiq said: \u201cWe would like to apologise again to all the patients affected by the suspension of our fertility services. We are pleased that the HFEA has informed us we can resume work at the fertility centre. \n\"Our primary focus remains the safe management of our patients. Following the HFEA\u2019s decision, we have begun planning for the gradual resumption of services. We will be reaching out to patients soon with updates.\u201d\nThe trust said as of April 2024 it had a total of 869 patients, whom it said \"have been contacted by various means\".\nThe Homerton Fertility Centre, based at Homerton Hospital, provides fertility treatment such as egg and embryo freezing and IVF to hundreds of NHS and private patients each year.\nThe trust has said the embryos of 32 patients had either not survived or were untraceable due to the incidents, in May, October and December 2023.\nMany other patients awaiting treatment cycles had their plans to try to have children put on hold when the clinic was ordered to close on 7 March.\nThe NHS trust appointed external investigators to review these incidents and some of the findings have been submitted to the HFEA.\nPeter Thompson, the regulator's chief executive, said the HFEA was satisfied the clinic could reopen due to changes it has introduced.\n\u201cThe clinic has introduced new ways of working as a result of the investigation,\" he said. \"The HFEA\u2019s Licence Committee has agreed that a limited number of cycles can be undertaken to allow these new ways of working to \u2018bed in\u2019 and ensure staff feel supported.\n\u201cThe clinic will, therefore, have a phased return to providing treatment. The clinic remains under a heightened degree of regulatory oversight and the HFEA will closely monitor it, including an unannounced inspection within the next six months.\n\u201cIncidents in fertility clinics in the UK are rare, but each one is distressing for those patients involved. The HFEA ensures incidents are thoroughly investigated in clinics to make sure that everything is done to understand what went wrong and, crucially, to take steps to ensure it does not happen again.\u201d\nThe HFEA said it took the decision to suspend the clinic's licence in March due to the \"potential risk to patients, gametes and embryos\".\nAccording to a recent meeting of the regulator's licensing committee, investigators tried to find out why some embryos could not be found in the solution they were frozen in.\n\"The independent reviewer took an extremely methodical approach to investigate this incident, however concluded that it was difficult to ascertain a definitive root cause.\n\"The centre has updated equipment and documentation and put in stringent practices,\" the committee said.\nThe committee said it had received the investigation report into why fewer than the expected number of embryos had survived over a certain time frame in 2023.\nThe report said \"the embryology team were as methodical and focused as they could be with the level of work and number/experience of staff available\". \n\"Further peer support and learning opportunities for sharing best practice have been made available for staff,\" it said.\nThe full findings of these investigations have not been published, despite repeated requests from the BBC.\nThe Homerton Hospital clinic has been under a high level of regulatory oversight for several years, with one inspection finding numerous areas of non-compliance.\nThe clinic was also forced to close for several months in 2022 due to staff shortages.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "\u201cI can barely believe it.\u201d\nThat was one left-wing activist\u2019s response to the exit poll which showed the left ahead in France\u2019s parliamentary elections.\nAt an election count at Pessac, in the Bordeaux region, disbelief blended into euphoria as the news sunk in that the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) - not the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) - had come first. Teary-eyed volunteers hugged each other and gave triumphant whoops as the winning NFP candidate, S\u00e9bastien Saint-Pasteur, walked in.\n\u201cI am cherishing this moment,\u201d Salima Z, an NPF activist, told me. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about what comes next yet.\u201d\nThe so-called \u201crepublican front\u201d holding was key to the NFP\u2019s victory. The front - a type of forced tactical voting, where some candidates withdraw to leave a single option for anti-far right voters - prevented scores of RN candidates winning.\nEast of Bordeaux, RN candidate Sandrine Chadourne expected to easily take the seat she was standing in. But in the end, she was narrowly beaten because of voters like winemaker Paul Carrille, who said he viewed voting against the far right as his democratic duty.\n\u201cOur institutions are strong. But it would still be very bad for the far right to win,\u201d Mr Carrille told me outside the medieval town hall in Libourne.\nVoters seemed to realise that they were in a unique - for many, uniquely dangerous - political moment. Turnout in the country was the highest for 25 years. In some seats where the RN stood a chance of winning, numbers were up in the second round compared to the first.\nNFP candidates were also helped by campaigns often grounded in their local areas. As Mr Saint-Pasteur, a longstanding local official, went around the town of Pessac on election day, he seemed to know many voters he greeted by name. \nBy contrast, his RN opponent was an 18-year-old high school student who was accused of ducking scrutiny by refusing to debate between the two rounds of voting.\nBut even though the RN underperformed expectations, its result was still the best in its history. It has only slightly fewer MPs than the other two blocs in parliament.\nAnd the rage felt by its voters towards establishment politics is unlikely to dissipate. Sylvie, a first-time RN voter, told me she was angry at high taxes being used to \u201cpay for illegal immigrants\u201d.\n\u201cWe have tried all the other parties \u2013 why not them?\u201d\nAddressing that anger before the next presidential election, due in 2027, will be the paramount task of the next government.\nMr Saint-Pasteur alluded to the scale of the challenge following his election victory.\n\u201cThe French people have sent a clear signal that they do not want the RN,\u201d he told me.\n\u201cBut if, by 2027, people have not been given the answers they need, more social justice and less inequality\u2026 maybe this time Marine Le Pen will win.\u201d",
    "Deborah Horsley was diagnosed with cancer after finding an ulcer on her tongue in 2009.\nSince then, the cancer spread to her gum and then to her jaw.\nThe latest operation in January to replace and rebuild her jaw failed when her body rejected the new jaw and tissue.\nThe 57-year-old mother of two, from Thetford in Norfolk, has now undergone 15 operations, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

    "Northern Ireland's party leaders have given the new prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, a warm welcome to Stormont. \n\"Constructive\", \"productive\" and \"positive\" are some of the words they used to describe their meetings with the first Labour prime minister in 14 years. \nSir Keir met the first and deputy first ministers as well as executive and opposition representatives at Stormont, as part of his first visit official to Northern Ireland since taking up the role.\nHe was accompanied by the new Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn and his chief of staff and former senior Stormont civil servant Sue Gray.\nThe prime minister travelled to Scotland at the weekend and went to Cardiff after leaving Belfast.\nSpeaking afterwards Sir Keir emphasised a \"reset\" in relationships between his government and the executive. \n\"Being here on day three of the new Labour government is a clear statement of intent about the importance of Northern Ireland to me and my government, about resetting relationships and moving forward in a respectful and collaborative way,\" he told journalists. \nThe new prime minister distanced himself from the \"instability\" of the former Conservative government.\n\"My government has a mandate for change and stability here in Northern Ireland and a different way of doing politics,\" he said. \n\nSinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald described her party\u2019s talks with the new prime minister as \u201cconstructive and very friendly\u201d.\nShe said dealing with the new Labour government, compared to the previous Conservative government, was like the difference between \"daylight and dark\".\nOne of the issues discussed at the short meeting was funding for the redevelopment of Casement Park stadium in west Belfast.\nMs McDonald said: \u201cWe expect to see progress on that matter in the near future.\u201d\nShe was joined at the meeting by First Minister Michelle O\u2019Neill and MPs John Finucane and Pat Cullen.\nAlso discussed at the talks was funding for public services in Northern Ireland, the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and the situation in Gaza.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson said he believed his party would have a good relationship with the new prime minister.\nHe described the meeting as \"very productive\" and highlighted the importance of devolution.\nAfter meeting Sir Keir at Stormont, Mr Robinson described him as a \u201cunionist\u201d and someone who has a detailed grasp of Northern Ireland.\nAsked if he trusted the new prime minister, he said he liked him.\nMr Robinson was accompanied at the meeting by Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly, Stormont Education Minister Paul Givan and MP Sammy Wilson.\nAlliance leader Naomi Long also said she had a \"constructive and positive meeting\" with both Sir Keir and Mr Benn.\nShe said the prime minister was keen to increase stability across the UK, and that it was put to him that in Northern Ireland \"fiscal and political reform\" was a baseline in order for this to work.\nMrs Long also said she was feeling positive about renewed east-west relations.\n\"Hopefully this will mark a new start both in terms of relationships between Belfast and London, but also I would hope London and Dublin,\" she said.\n\"Certainly the last government I think left us with a very toxic legacy, and I hope that will be reversed under the current prime minister.\"\nThe Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said he raised the need for more funding for public services, particularly the health service, with the prime minister.\nBringing both Health Minister Mike Nesbitt and the former health minister and newly elected South Antrim MP Robin Swann with him, Mr Beattie said the meeting was \"very positive\" and could be used to build upon relationships.\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said he felt a \u201ccollective sigh of relief\u201d at the end of the Conservative government.\nHe added that Sir Keir is someone \"who gets it\" and that whilst they had a good discussion, the PM recognised the party would be holding him to account on key issues such as Casement Park and the Legacy Act.\n\u201cThis seems like a new dawn,\u201d he said.\nOn a day when reset was the buzz word, Prime Minister Keir Starmer appears to have reset his position on a border poll.\nHaving previously told the BBC in 2021 he would campaign for Northern Ireland to remain in the UK he has now changed his mind.\nInstead he said his government would adopt the role of \u201chonest broker\u201d in any constitutional debate.\nThat, he said, is in keeping with the Good Friday Agreement which states it is for those on the island of Ireland to decide their fate.\nIt is a tricky minefield for a Labour prime minister to negotiate but Keir Starmer knows how Northern Ireland works.\nIt was a careful and deliberate reset on his first day in Northern Ireland as prime minister.\nThough the DUP leader Gavin Robinson insisted the prime minister is a unionist at heart.\nThe new Secretary of State Hilary Benn arrived in Northern Ireland on Saturday and held tal",
    "Northern Ireland Justice Minister Naomi Long will not appeal a court ruling that struck down a law on identifying suspected sex offenders.\nIn May, a judge ruled the legislation was not compatible with human rights or press freedom.  \nMrs Long said she had been \u201cminded\u201d to appeal the judgement on constitutional grounds, but other parties did not share her concern.\nThe law, called the Justice (Sexual Offences and Trafficking Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022, came into effect in 2023.\nIt granted anonymity for life - and for 25 years after death - to suspects who were not charged with any sexual offences.\nMedia organisations had joined forces in a bid to have sections of it declared legally invalid.\nAt the time, the justice minister rejected claims the law had been rushed through or that she had misled the assembly over it.\nOn Wednesday, Mrs Long issued an urgent written statement to the assembly confirming she would not challenge the ruling.\nShe said legal advice had indicated to her that the ruling would have a \u201csubstantial effect\u201d on assembly processes for scrutinising its laws, as well as for executive ministers and all departments in taking forward legislation.\n\u201cThese potential impacts go much further than my department or this particular piece of assembly legislation,\u201d she said.\n\n\nThe minister said she had also been advised that, in the absence of a challenge in this case, the prospects of another department successfully defending any similar challenge to assembly legislation in the future would, at first instance, be \u201csignificantly compromised\u201d.\n\u201cAny other High Court judge would have to be satisfied that the judge in this case had been plainly wrong before they could depart from his reasoning,\u201d she added.\nMrs Long said it was for those reasons only that she explored the option of an appeal.\nShe wrote to executive colleagues last week \u201dto seek their views\u201d on the constitutional implications.\n\u201cI indicated that I was minded, on the strength of the legal advice, to challenge the judgment on the constitutional issues alone, but sought their written responses by 17:00 BST on 2 July,\u201d said the minister.\nShe told the assembly that the responses from Sinn F\u00e9in, the DUP and Ulster Unionists indicated that those parties do not share her concerns about the wider implications of the judgement.\n\u201cGiven my only reason for considering an appeal was these wider implications to the assembly, its departments and ministers, I have decided not to proceed with an appeal,\u201d she said.",

    "An 18-year-old is circumnavigating the entire coastline of Britain in an attempt to break a world record. \nHarry Besley, from Taunton, will depart on his journey mid-July in a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) powered solely by electricity, a challenge no one has attempted before.\nHe is hoping the trip will showcase new technology and help to raise awareness of how power boat users can do their bit to reduce carbon emissions.\n\"That record has never been set yet before so we'll be the first, and the fastest,\" he said.\nAccording to Round Britain eRIB, the secret to covering longer distances in electric boats is a slower speed, so they will be taking things steady and using an escort vessel to keep them safe.\nThey will also be stopping at more than 40 points along the way to charge the boat's engine, and promoting the new technology in marinas, harbours, tourist hotspots and remote coastal villages.\n\"This is really to raise awareness of the possibility of electric boats,\" said Mr Besley.\n\"It hasn't been talked about much, electric and sustainable boating.

    "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has told members of her Brothers of Italy (FdI) party that she was \u201cangry and saddened\u201d after an investigative outlet published two reports showing members of the party's youth wing making fascist salutes and using racist and antisemitic language.\n\u201cThere is no room [in FdI] for racist or antisemitic positions, in the same way as there is no room for nostalgia for the totalitarian systems of the 20th Century, or for any other display of foolish folklore,\u201d Ms Meloni wrote in a letter.\nShe added she had \u201cno time to waste with those who want to, unwittingly or not, become a tool in the hands of our adversaries\u201d.\n\u201cThose who are unable to understand this, who have not understood the path [we are on] or who are unable to keep up cannot be part of Brothers of Italy.\"\nIn the first report put out by investigative outlet Fanpage in mid-June, members on FdI\u2019s National Youth wing (Giovent\u00f9 Nazionale - GN) can be heard chanting slogans like \u201cFor a cleaner world, come back, Uncle Benito [Mussolini]\u201d and \u201cSieg Heil!\u201d\nThe videos were gathered by undercover journalists who infiltrated the group posing as potential new members. \nTwo weeks later, a second instalment of the investigation showed several members and local leaders making derogatory remarks about disabled people, as well as racist comments and antisemitic remarks.\nFanpage said that after the report came out, several former members of the FdI youth wing got in touch to share their experiences within the group. Many said they had witnessed similar behaviour in local branches across Italy.\nSeveral of the more high-profile members of the GN featured in the investigation were seen as rising stars within the main Brothers of Italy party.\nOne of them, Elisa Segnini, who could be heard in one of the videos as saying she had \u201cnever stopped being a racist or a fascist\u201d, has since resigned from her role as cabinet secretary to an FdI MP.\nLocal chapter leader Flaminia Pace stepped down from her senior role within the GN after she was caught on camera mocking a Jewish FdI senator, Ester Mieli.\nCommenting on the Nazi-inspired slogans and the antisemitic rhetoric used by GN members, Italian senator and Holocaust survivor Liliana Segre, 93, told Italian TV: \u201cThe deviations that have come to the fore recently\u2026 have always existed, but used to be hidden, not paraded about.\u201d\nMs Segre added: \u201cAt my age, must I witness this once more? Will I be thrown out of my country again, like I was in the past?\u201d\nMinister Luca Ciriani of FdI said the reports were based on \u201cfragmented, decontextualised images taken in a private setting\u201d.\nOther FdI party members, however, condemned the behaviour of the youth wing members. The President of the Senate, Ignazio La Russa, said the language used by GN went \u201cagainst the values of our party\u201d and condemned \u201call forms of racism and antisemitism\u201d.\nMs Meloni, however, did not immediately respond to the Fanpage investigation. She acknowledged it for the first time last week, when she criticised the outlet by saying it had used \u201cmethods worthy of an [authoritarian] regime\u201d when it infiltrated the youth wing of her party.\n\u201cWhy did [Fanpage] only do this with FdI?,\u201d she asked, adding: \u201cIs this even allowed?\u201d\nBut she also added that \u201cracist, antisemitic or nostalgic ideas\u201d were \u201cincompatible with Brothers of Italy\".\nSimona Malpezzi, an opposition senator of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), said Ms Meloni should have \u201cthanked the Fanpage journalists who shone the light on an extremely serious issue concerning the youth wing [Ms Meloni] is so proud of\u2026 She should distance herself from the people who used to be considered the party\u2019s rising stars.\u201d\nMs Meloni has previously praised GN. At a political event last December, she said her younger supporters were \"wonderful\", saying: \"Many are jealous of us because we have young people who still believe in politics... It's rare and it's precious.\"\nSince becoming the leader of a right-wing coalition and Italy\u2019s prime minister in 2022, Ms Meloni has often found herself at the centre of controversy involving her Brothers of Italy party, which has its political roots in the far-right Italian Social Movement (MSI) - set up by former Mussolini supporters after World War II.\nIn June, the spokesperson for agriculture minister and key Meloni ally Francesco Lollobrigida resigned following the publication of wiretapped calls and messages that contained racist and antisemitic comments.",

We are immensely grateful for her outstanding efforts,\" he said.\nMr Harrop added: \"Her story serves as a powerful testament to the profound impact one individual can have.\"\nMs Swallow said she had \"never, ever, in my wildest dreams\" imagined she would raise as much money for the charity as she had.\n\"People say to me, 'how  much longer will you be doing it?' I say, 'as long as I enjoy doing it',\" she added.\n\"I still get a massive buzz when I can come home and count how much I've raised, and I can hand that over to the Yorkshire Air Ambulance.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

    "The mayor of Greater Manchester has called on the new government to \"move on really quickly\" with plans for a railway that could cut journey times to Liverpool by about 25 minutes.\nAndy Burnham said he believed Labour's election win could lead to a \"great era for the English cities and regions\".\nA proposal for an extra line between Liverpool and Manchester was announced in May to improve the region's economy and connections, where rail journeys between the cities vary between 40 minutes and an hour.\nThe Labour mayor called on the prime minister to \"commit early to the Northern Powerhouse - deliver what the Tories said they would do but never did\".\nThe Northern Powerhouse term was used in 2014 by then Conservative chancellor George Osborne, when he outlined steps to boost the region's economy and transport. \nSpeaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Burnham said: \"We now have the chance, after lots of turbulence in recent times, to have a serious government focused on growth and delivery without all of the psychodramas of the past Tory years.\"\nHe said he wanted Greater Manchester to build \"at least our share, if not more\" of the 1.5 million homes, which Labour said it would build in the next five years. \nHe also called for Sir Keir to keep the two-child cap on certain benefits \"under review\" after the Labour leader faced previous backlash when he refused to abolish the limit. \nOn Saturday, the prime minister said he \"can't make a commitment\" to removing the limit, which restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in a family, but he was \"determined\" to reduce child poverty. \nMr Burnham said there was \"grinding poverty in parts of Greater Manchester\" alongside economic growth, adding: \"We do need to see change in people's real living standards and we want to lift as many children as we can out of poverty.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Commuter rail services in the capital currently managed by private companies could  come under Transport for London's (TfL) control, Sadiq Khan has said.\nHe was speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and England's 11 other regional mayors in Downing Street on \"a major programme of devolution\".\nThe mayor said they also discussed devolving more powers over skills and training, as well as additional funding. \nDuring the election, Labour pledged it would renationalise nearly all passenger rail services in England within five years - a pledge the Conservatives said was \"unfunded\".\nUnder their plan, a new public body would inherit existing contracts with private operators when they expire, taking on responsibility for running services.\nMr Khan said: \"One of the things that was confirmed from the meeting this morning is once those franchises end and are brought into [Department for Transport control], they will be talking to mayors like me about which of those railways we can take over.\n\"I\u2019ll be lobbying for once those franchises end, those commuter trains that come into London for us to have that.\"\n\"Watch this space,\" he added.\nWhile TfL runs the majority of public transport services within the capital, Network Rail routes are operated by private firms, including Thameslink and Southern.\nIt would not be the first time suburban rail services came under the direct control of TfL and a London mayor.\nKen Livingstone grabbed the failing Silverlink franchise and turned it into the Overground, while Boris Johnson took over West Anglia.\nMr Khan said that while the end of the franchises remains \"some years away\", he would lobby the government for the resources to take them on once it happens.\n\"What I wouldn\u2019t do because it would be letting down Londoners is take on these additional lines without additional resources because they need some investment, they have been neglected for too long,\" he said.\nDuring the election campaign, then-Conservative transport secretary Mark Harper claimed Labour's renationalisation plans were unfunded.\n\"You're going to go back to French-style wildcat strikes with no notice,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Transport said the government would deliver \"the biggest overhaul to our railways in a generation\" and create a \"publicly-owned, passenger focused Great British Railways\".\n\"Under our plans for publicly-owned passenger rail, as franchises expire, they will come under Great British Railways\u2019 control,\" they added.\nOn broader plans for devolution, Mr Khan called the new Labour government's pitch to the mayors \"transformative\". \nNevertheless, no definitive plans on what additional powers will be given to the London mayor or other regions has been confirmed.\nMr Khan added: \"What\u2019s clear from listening to Angela Rayner and Keir Starmer today is they are really keen to devolve more powers not just to London but to other parts of the country. \n\"You will be hearing in the course of the next few weeks and months examples of those additional powers.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he is not in favour of \"simply banning\" phones for children under 16.\nIn May, a committee of MPs said the new government should consider a ban within its first year, warning of the \"serious dangers\" posed to children online.\nThe prime minister said there was a \"serious question\" to be asked about what content children can access.\nHowever, he would not be drawn on whether his own teenage children have their screen time monitored.\nSpeaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain, Sir Keir said \"I think we need to look again\" at how online content is controlled.\nBut the prime minister, who has repeatedly expressed concerns about his children's privacy, said he and his wife had taken a \"strong decision\" to keep their offspring out of political discussions.\n\"Generally, I do think we should look at what is available online to children, but in relation to simply banning phones for under-16s, I don't think that's a good idea. I don't think that's a practical way forward,\" he said.\nSpeaking to the programme during his trip to Washington DC for the Nato summit, Sir Keir said he would \"sit down with anyone\" to look at how to put in place better protections.\n\"All parents and everybody across the country is concerned about what can actually be accessed on a phone,\" he said.\nIn February, the previous government issued guidance for schools to restrict phone use during the school day.\nIt suggested examples of how to achieve a phone-free environment, including a total ban on school premises, or rules requiring that handsets are given in at the start of the day.\nSir Keir met Esther Ghey when she visited Parliament to campaign after the death of her daughter, Brianna.\nShe has called for children to be stopped from having access to social media apps on their phones, an idea that was backed by the children's commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza.\nIn May, the Education Select Committee said children's screen time had been rising year on year.\nOne in four children use their phones in a manner that resembles \"behavioural addiction\", its report said, while 79% of children have encountered violent pornography before the age of 18.\nThe report said the Online Safety Act, which puts responsibility on social media firms to protect children from harmful material, would play a role in keeping children safe, but not until it was fully implemented in 2026.\nChildren's charity the NSPCC, however, has said the debate on screen time and online safety has so far had the voices of young people themselves \"glaringly absent\" from it.",
    "Archaeologists have uncovered surviving features of a Victorian university building almost 140 years after it was gutted by a fire which killed three people.\nCharred wood, blackened walls and laboratory equipment have been revealed by work to renovate Aberystwyth\u2019s Grade I listed Old College building.\nThe \u00a343m restoration project aims to give new life to the building, which will become a centre for learning, heritage, culture and enterprise, and include a four-star hotel. \nOnce complete, it is expected to attract 200,000 visitors a year and contribute up to \u00a314.5m annually to the local economy.\nPart of the renovation involves digging down into the building\u2019s basement where archaeologists have found remnants of the devastating fire which started in a chemistry laboratory.\nPieces of charred wood have been found in the rubble as well as a damaged Bunsen burner, a small stove and a number of glass bottles. \nAt the time of the fire \u2013 8 July 1885 \u2013 the Old College included a number of academic departments, a library, museum and living quarters.\nIn a report, the local paper the Cambrian News and Meirionethshire Standard described the fire\u2019s devastating effects.\nIt said how a Mr Stone, \"headmaster of the collegiate school,\" was standing on the \"terrace in front of the college when the chimney which crushed the museum fell\", causing him to jump on to the beach below. \nIt\u2019s believed the fire started on the fifth floor and, according to the newspaper report, an investigation was carried out by Colonel Sir Charles Firth, president of the Fire Brigade Association in London.\nThe report says he concluded \"the cause of the fire was spontaneous combustion amongst the cotton waste used in cleaning up after the chemical experiments in the laboratory department\".\nIt\u2019s believed the fire caused oxygen cylinders in the laboratory to explode.\nElgan Davies, who worked as a librarian in the Old College, has written about the building's history.\nHe said the fire was \"very bad, not only physically in burning the building\" but also because three men died.\nOn the night of the fire, local people \u2013 who had helped raise the money to set up the university in 1872 \u2013 went into the burning building to try to save valuables, according to Mr Davies.\n\"Efforts were made to save treasures from the library and the museum and those were brought out,\" he said.\n\"But there was still three people inside fighting the fire in the museum when the floor gave way. They fell through to the floor below, and were terribly burned and died.\"\nThe men who were killed were James Edwin Brett, who was 21 and lived with his mother, Samuel Jones, who was married with two children, and John Davies, who was married with six children.\nFaye Thompson, the collections co-ordinator for the Old College project, said the men had no direct link with the university, but their actions were still appreciated today. \n\u201c[Their bravery] enabled us to save the entirety of the library collections, and a lot of the museum pieces too,\" she said.\n\"We have some pieces now in our collection that we can display again because they survived the fire due to the efforts of these men and others as well.\"\nThe funerals of the three men who died were attended by local dignitaries and more than 2,000 people.\nNow, almost 140 years after the fire, evidence of its effects has come to light as the current renovation work continues.\nJessica Domiczew, from Welsh archaeology trust Heneb, said her team are \"piecing together the building\u2019s story bit by bit\" after archaeologists working with building contractors found objects from the time of the fire hidden in rubble.\n\"Throughout the excavation we've had a few pieces of wood which [are] quite heavily burned, dotted throughout the gallery. There's a very good chance that it's connected to the fire [but] we don't have any real other explanation of where it's from,\" she said.\n\"It's very exciting as an archaeologist - we don't really get so many well-intact artefacts like this.\"\nAberystwyth University was still a young institution at the time of the fire, opening its doors just 13 years earlier in 1872.\nAfter the blaze, there were suggestions that the idea of maintaining a university in Aberystwyth should be abandoned and funding diverted to set up a new institution in Swansea.\nBut, the Old College was rebuilt - paid for by \u00a310,000 of insurance money and thousands more raised by ordinary people from across Wales and beyond. \nThe current renovation project is respectful of the building\u2019s history and heritage while also giving it a future for generations to come, said project manager Jim O\u2019Rourke, who added that first electric light and the first telephone in Aberystwyth were both installed in the Old College.\n\"The Old College has been at the forefront of changes but we now need to make it suitable for current expectations in terms of access, and how it develops to use modern technologies, as well as telling the story of the historic spaces we have here,\" he said.",

    "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says his first face-to-face talks with US President Joe Biden were an opportunity to \"recommit\" to Nato and the \"special relationship\" between the UK and US.\nFacing reporters in the White House, Sir Keir told the president: \"The special relationship is so important. It's forged in difficult circumstances, endured for so long, and stronger now than ever.\"\nThe new prime minister met President Biden for the first time at Nato's 75th anniversary summit in Washington just hours before their private talks in the Oval Office.\nPresident Biden called the US and UK the \"best of allies\", saying the UK was \"the transatlantic knot\" that ties Nato together with its European members.\nIt comes as Sir Keir is looking to form a new security pact with EU nations to strengthen co-operation on defence.\nThe two leaders' meeting came as Nato agreed further support for Ukraine at the Washington summit.\nSir Keir also confirmed that the UK's \u00a33bn a year military aid for Kyiv would continue.\nPresident Biden said \u201cthings are moving in the right direction, I\u2019m feeling really optimistic\".\nThe prime minister congratulated President Biden on hosting the summit, adding it was \"a bigger Nato, a stronger Nato and a Nato with the resolve that we need\".\nThe Labour leader - on his first overseas visit as prime minister - is a season ticket holder at Arsenal Football Club and gave President Biden a personalised team shirt as a present. \nIt has President Biden's surname on the back and the number 46 - a reference to him being the 46th US president.\nSir Keir also gave him a copy of the Atlantic Charter - the 1941 US-UK declaration which paved the way for the formation of the military alliance - featuring amendments from the then Labour leader Clement Attlee.\nForeign Secretary David Lammy, who accompanied Sir Keir on the trip, met his US counterpart Antony Blinken.\nThe State Department said the pair \"re-affirmed the importance of ensuring Ukraine has the economic, security, and humanitarian assistance it needs to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity\".\nThey \"discussed the need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza that secures the release of hostages and lays the groundwork for durable peace\".\nNew UK Defence Secretary John Healey met his US counterpart Lloyd Austin.\nThere was no mention of Sir Keir's Arsenal shirt gift when the two leaders spoke to reporters before their White House meeting - but there was a little time for both men to hail England\u2019s 2-1 victory over the Netherlands in the semi-finals of Euro 2024. \nSubstitute Ollie Watkins's last-minute winning goal in the match was scored just before Sir Keir arrived for the talks. \nAsked by reporters about the result, President Biden said, \u201cI heard\u201d. \n\u201cGood news indeed,\u201d he added, joking that \u201cit\u2019s all because of the prime minister\".\nAnd the prime minister, when asked by the BBC's political editor Chris Mason, \"is football coming home?\", replied: \u201cIt looks like it.\u201d \nSir Keir has confirmed he will be attending the final against Spain in Berlin on Sunday.\nAt one point during the Nato summit, a video clip posted on X by Sir Keir showed him stopping between meetings to watch England captain Harry Kane take a penalty.",
    "Staff at Greater Manchester's Metrolink Bee tram network will strike over pay during the summer.\nUnite members said a 4.5% pay rise coming on the back of successive below-inflation pay increases was \"intolerable\".\nThe strike is due to take place on 25, 26 and 27 July during Peter Kay's stand-up show at the AO Arena, UFC 304 and Manchester's City Centre Day. \nMetrolink's operator, KeolisAmey said they were \"disappointed\" pay talks have been unsuccessful but \"remain committed to meaningful discussions\". \nMayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said he hoped KeolisAmey and the union could between them avert the industrial action.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Manchester following his announcement of a major expansion of the Bee Network Mr Burham did not say whether he would intervene in the dispute.\nBut he said he would be keeping the situation \"under review\".\nHe said he \"[didn't] want to have a situation where our passengers are inconvenienced\" but neither did he want a situation where \"there are disagreements between the unions and the operator\".\nHe added: \"We need to look after [the staff], but we have to do it in a way that is reasonable, and what we can afford.\"\nMetrolink is a joint venture between the companies Keolis and Amey, who run it on behalf of Transport for Greater Manchester.\nA Unite spokesman said members wanted guarantees of above-inflation rises over the next three years and a reduction in the pay progression scales within the drivers and customer service roles.\nThey said \"furious\" staff have to wait four years to get to the top of their pay scales, and as a result lose up to \u00a315,000, despite doing the exact same job as colleagues.\nColin Hayden, Unite regional officer, described the current pay offer as \"woeful\".  \n\"This dispute is entirely the making of Metrolink and their parent companies. \n\"They can easily afford to pay our members a decent salary after years of real-terms pay cuts.\n\"I urge Metrolink, their parent companies and TfGM to come back with an improved offer rather than continue to demonstrate how little they value their own staff and the communities of Greater Manchester,\" he said.\nDamien Chabas, managing director of KeolisAmey, said they believed its offer through to 2026 \"provides stability and security\" against inflation increases, and was a \"fair deal\".\n\"There was also an offer of \u00a30.5m investment to address the historical pay structure raised by Unite, however this was rejected by them,\" Mr Chabas said.\n\"We have a positive track record of fair pay negotiations because we care about our people.\"\nMr Chabas added since the start of their contract in 2017, employees had received pay increases of more than 30%, with some employees receiving over 38%.\nHe said: \"Last year was an exceptional year for inflation, yet our employees still received a pay increase of 6.5% plus a \u00a31,000 one off payment, amounting to an approximate 9% increase.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "There is a huge list of credits on the end of Kevin Costner\u2019s latest film Horizon: An American Saga.\nHardly surprising, given it is three hours and one minute long and just part of a four-film vision which the Hollywood actor and director has wanted to make for almost 40 years. \nAmong those names is a Scottish orchestra which played a central role in the film, released in cinemas this past weekend.\nThe Royal Scottish National Orchestra (RSNO) was approached by Costner last year to record the soundtrack for the film.\nComposer John Debney \u2013 whose credits include Elf and The Passion of the Christ - had worked with the RSNO before.\n\u201cWe had no scope for recording in LA, so I offered a few options,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe considered London, and Nashville but when I mentioned Scotland, Kevin\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201d\nBoth Debney and Costner came to the RSNO Centre last August and spent five days recording the soundtrack.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the greatest moments of the filmmaking process, to be in the scoring session,\" Costner told BBC Scotland News.\n\"I work harder on getting the cameras and the screens into the room and let John (Debney) do the heavy lifting but I wanted the musicians to see and that was a new experience for them to see the film and meet the filmmaker and be a part of it and I think they really responded to that.\n\"You can be a minimalist and get back or take a bold run and match the landscape and John\u2019s talent meant he matched the landscape.\n\"Music is important but it\u2019s important to get the right guy and for Horizon, John Debney was the right guy.\"\nAlthough the RSNO is known for its recording work, it is only since moving into its own purpose-built centre in the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall complex in 2015 that it has been able to develop permanent facilities.\n\u201cIt was a thrill to give them a chance to play on a canvas so big,\" Costner said. \"All we wanted to do was make them feel a part of it because we knew the difference they were making.\n\"It\u2019s a thing I want to have out there that people can find and watch and revisit and marvel at the scenery and the performances and this music which is a magic carpet of emotion that just picks you up and takes you away the moment the first stake goes in the ground.\u201d\nAs lead trumpet player with the Philharmonia orchestra in London, Alistair Mackie regularly worked on soundtracks at Abbey Road.\nWhen he became CEO of the RSNO in 2019, he saw a chance for the orchestra to pick up on the demand for recording work.\nTwo years ago, they launched their own studio for film, television and games soundtrack recording.\nAs the only orchestra in the UK with in-house facilities to record sound to picture, they have secured a range of clients including Warner Bros, Netflix, Sony, Disney and Apple TV.\nBut it can be months or years before the orchestra can admit involvement in projects.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of work on movies and video games but we have to sign non-disclosure agreements so we have to respect the privacy of the clients who come here until the film is released and then we can shout about it,\u201d Mackie said.\nProjects since released include the films The Woman King and Argylle, TV show Life on Our Planet and the video games Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaw.\nAnd, of course, Horizon: An American Saga, which earned Costner an 11-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival when it was screened there in May.\n\u201cKevin Costner was very active in the film making process,\u201d Mackie said.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to sit in the control room,  he wanted to sit with the musicians in the recording studio so we found him a sofa and sent someone round to John Lewis to get the biggest possible television screen so he could watch the film while he was listening.\n\"He was fabulous to work with and it was great to see him there in the middle of the film-making process.\u201d\nCostner is passionate about Westerns. He directed and starred in Dances With Wolves in 1990, which won seven Oscars  including Best Picture and Best Director. \nHe and composer John Debney had previously worked together on the American TV series Hatfields and McCoys and bonded over their mutual admiration for the 1962 film How The West Was Won.\nThey both hoped to return to Glasgow at the beginning of June for the recording of the soundtrack for the second Horizon film, which is due to be released in August.\nThat proved impossible, with both composer and director tied up with post-production in LA. \nBut they were able to join the recording sessions virtually, thanks to the newly expanded control room in the Glasgow studio.\n\u201cThe development of technology has been mind-blowing,\u201d Debney said.\n\u201cI can sit in my studio in Burbank, California and I\u2019m talking to everyone in Glasgow in real time. I can hear the music play, talk to the engineer, and talk to the conductor.\n\u201cNot as good as being there but it\u2019s the next best thing. And hopefully we\u2019ll come next time.\u201d\nCostner is already planning the third film in the four-part epic. Much will depen",
    "General election candidates from across Leicestershire have faced off in a debate hosted by BBC Radio Leicester.\nThe NHS, the economy, the cost of living and trust in politicians drove the discussion between four candidates hoping to be elected as MPs on Thursday.\nThe themes that shaped the debate were picked based on messages submitted through the BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote campaign.\nBut what did we learn from it?\nLabour, the Liberal Democrats, Reform UK and the Greens provided candidates for the debate but there was a notable absence.\nBBC Leicester invited the Conservatives to attend but they did not provide a representative.\nInstead, the party sent a statement.\nIt said: \"In this election, the people of Leicestershire have a choice. \n\"They can either stick with a plan and return Rishi Sunak to Number 10 continuing to bring down inflation and build a strong economy and deliver a safe and secure future. \n\"Under Keir Starmer and the Labour party, this is all at risk. \n\"Labour has no plan for controlling our borders and improving our economy. \n\"Labour will take us back to square one and cannot be trusted to deliver security in uncertain times.\"\nJeevun Sandher, who is standing in Loughborough for Labour, said: \"The Labour party turned up to this debate as did the other candidates.\n\"The Conservatives did not show up and that is how much they care about the views and thoughts of those they are apparently seeking to represent.\u201d\nAll the candidates agreed the NHS and the wider care system were under huge pressure.\nSharmen Rahmen, who is standing in Leicester South for the Greens, said her party was the only one being honest about what was required to fix things.\nShe said the Greens would implement a wealth tax - of 1% on people with assets worth \u00a310m - to fund extra appointments and capacity.\nReform's Andy McWilliam - who is standing in Loughborough - said the NHS was not improving despite the investment in recent years. \nReform, he said, would cut the basic rate of income tax for some NHS staff to encourage them not to leave the service.\nLiberal Democrat candidate for Leicester East Zuffar Haq said the city had \"lost out again and again\" on large amounts of promised NHS funding under both Labour and Tory governments.\nHe said there needed to be investment in adult social care to prevent bed-blocking in hospitals.\nHe said Lib Dem tax rises on banks, energy firms and gambling firms would fund \u00a39bn of investment in the care sector.\nMr Sandher said Labour intended to set up a National Care Service to improve standards, pay and staff retention in the care sector.\nHe said a Labour government would \"rebuild and reform\" the NHS but admitted it would take time.\nVoters told BBC Leicester they were concerned about Leicestershire's struggling HIgh Streets.\nThe Reform and Lib Dem candidates agreed cutting business rates would give much-needed relief to hard-pressed retailers.\nMr Haq said: \"We\u2019d scrap business rates. That\u2019s one of the first things we\u2019d do.  \"Business are struggling to pay their rents and energy costs and the increase in the minimum wage.\u201d\nMr McWilliam said Reform would bring in a 4% tax on online retail deliveries to replace business rates income for councils.\nMs Rahman said the Greens would improve public transport to to support town and city centres by making it easier for people to get to them.\nEmpty shop units could be filled by encouraging community groups to take them up and make High Streets mor vibrant, Ms Sandher added. \nThe cost of living loomed large in the discussion.\nMr McWilliam said Reform would invest \u00a31bn in the country's farming industry to try to drive down the price of food  and \"get rid of re-wilding schemes\" to supply agricultural land.\nHe said there was a \"population crisis\" rather than a housing crisis and a net zero immigration policy would be needed.\nReform, he said, would cut \"green subsidies\" ro reduce taxes.\nMrs Rahman said said she was shocked by some of the rhetoric during the campaign which was \"scapegoating\" minorities.\nShe said the Greens would help with the cost of living by increasing the minimum wage to \u00a315 and implementing rent controls.\nMr Sandher said 14 years of Conservative government had made everyone poorer and said Labour would invest in green energy schemes that would reduce domestic bills.\nMr Haq also said the Lib Dems would cut bills by investing in green schemes such as  funding household insulation.\nEach candidate was asked why any voter should trust them to deliver on their promises.\nMr Haq said he was an experienced health campaigner and had a track record of \"doing things\" in Leicester, including campaigning for a multi-storey car park at the Leicester Royal Infirmary.\nMrs Rahman said she understood why many voters had lost faith in politicians and their promises, describing Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer as \"Mr U-turn\". \nMr Sandher said Labour's election promises were \"ambitious but limited\".\n\u201cWe are not saying yes to everything,\" he said.\n\"We aren\u2019t throwin",
    "Millions of people across the UK are readying themselves to vote in Thursday's general election, as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak battles to keep opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer out of 10 Downing Street.\nMr Sunak's Conservatives and Sir Keir's Labour Party have spent the final days of the campaign reinforcing their key messages in a bid to win over wavering voters.\nFaced by poll after poll indicating a sizeable lead for Labour, the Conservatives are warning voters against allowing their rivals a huge majority \u2013 with one minister conceding that he expects a landslide. They also face a threat from right-wing party Reform UK, buoyed by the return to front-line politics of Nigel Farage.\nBut after four election defeats in a row and 14 years in opposition, Sir Keir's party says it is taking nothing for granted.\nAlthough themes such as living standards, health and immigration have dominated the national debate, smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party of England and Wales have pushed their own priorities as well.\nHere is everything you need to know as the country heads to the polls, with 650 seats in the House of Commons up for grabs.\nMindful that it has not won a general election since 2005 \u2013 and that its last result in 2019 under left-wing former leader Jeremy Corbyn was its worst for almost a century \u2013 Labour under Sir Keir has sought to show voters it has changed. \nSir Keir says the top priority for his government would be to grow the economy and through this improve living standards for the general population.\nUK household finances have taken a hit in recent years due to soaring inflation, experienced globally, and the highest tax burden in decades. However, Conservatives say this is a consequence of issues outside of their control, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. They also claim the tax burden would worsen under Labour.\nOne of Labour's most-discussed plans to raise money involves applying value-added tax (VAT) to private schools. \nMr Sunak, who took office in October 2022, has proposed tax cuts for the self-employed and a return to an era of mandatory national service for young people.\nLike Labour, he is also promising to boost home ownership.\nMr Sunak is reiterating his aim of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda in a bid to curb illegal migration - a pre-existing plan that has been mired in years of legal difficulties before it was approved by Parliament in April. \nImmigration is at the heart of some of the key pledges of the Reform UK, which says it would freeze \u201cnon-essential\u201d migration. Although it has just one MP, the party is consistently polling in third place.\nReform is a successor to the Brexit Party, which fought for a \u201chard\u201d withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. Despite being a major part of the Conservatives\u2019 legacy, Brexit has been largely absent from the election campaign.\nThe Liberal Democrats have pledged to reverse one aspect of Brexit by re-joining the European single market. As the party continues to recover from a 2015 election thrashing, it is also promising major investment in social care.\nMeanwhile, the Green Party of England and Wales \u2013 which currently has one MP - is running on a platform that includes new taxes on the wealthy and a policy of net-zero emissions by 2040.\nSir Keir and his colleagues have not only attacked their adversaries' track record in government \u2013 including a tumultuous period in 2022 when the UK had three prime ministers in a matter of weeks. They have also criticised the culture at the top of the Conservative Party, highlighting a recent alleged betting scandal.\nMr Sunak was also knocked off his key messaging earlier in the campaign when he was forced to apologise for his early exit from an event in France at which global leaders commemorated the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War Two.\nBut the Tories have managed to land blows on Reform, whose candidates have been caught in controversies of their own. Its new leader Nigel Farage, on his eighth attempt at winning a Westminster seat, triggered a backlash by suggesting that the West \"provoked\" the war in Ukraine.\nLabour has not been immune to pre-election headaches of its own, not least with a row over whether it would pick veteran left-winger Diane Abbott as a candidate.\nAnd Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey was prompted to clarify that he takes voters\u2019 concerns \u201cextremely seriously\u201d, after a string of electoral stunts - including a plunge in a lake - that he said were designed to call attention to his policies.\nSir Keir and his Labour candidates hope for a strong showing in Scotland - where polls suggest the SNP is at risk of losing Westminster seats after more than a decade of dominance. The nationalist party has been in a period of turmoil during a police probe into its finances.\nIts new leader John Swinney, appointed in May, has vowed to keep up his fight for Scottish interests, by ratcheting up pressure for a second vote on independence from ",

    "The new Labour government is facing a decision over continuing calls by the family of Pat Finucane for a public inquiry into his murder by loyalists in 1989.\nMr Finucane, 39, was a prominent solicitor who was shot at home by Ulster Defence Association (UDA) paramilitaries in front of his wife and children.\nIt follows a Court of Appeal ruling in Belfast, which gives the government weeks to deal with the issue.\nMr Finucane\u2019s son, John, who is the Sinn F\u00e9in MP for North Belfast, described the outcome as being \u201cof huge significance\u201d.\nThe Northern Ireland Office (NIO) said it will give the ruling \u201ccareful consideration\u201d.\nFor years, the Finucane family has campaigned for a public inquiry, after several examinations of the case found state forces colluded in the 1989 murder.\nIn 2019, the UK Supreme Court declared that earlier investigations failed to meet standards required by Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nSince then, the solicitor\u2019s widow, Geraldine Finucane, has mounted a series of legal battles over the government\u2019s response to the findings.\nIn the latest case, Lord Justice Horner set out a timetable for action.\nHe gave the government and Mrs Finucane three weeks to agree on an Article 2 compliant investigation into Mr Finucane's killing.\nHe said if there is no agreement, a further three weeks will be granted to allow parties to submit their own proposals. \n\"The court will endeavour to select from the two choices put forward by the respective parties,\" the judge said.\n\"In the unlikely event that the court is unable to choose either of the choices put forward, the court reserves the right to order its own Article 2 compliant process for the investigation into the callous and brutal murder of Mr Finucane as a last resort.\u201d\nJohn Finucane told BBC News NI: \u201cThe Court of Appeal has been scathing on the delay by the government to follow up on the Supreme Court judgement.\n\u201cAs a family, we are ready to talk to the new British government because one thing is clear - the courts have once again found emphatically on our behalf and we want to move forward.\n\u201cThere needs to be a public inquiry.\n\u201cEvery other thing the British government has tried over 35 years has been rejected by the courts.\u201d\nIn a statement the NIO said: \u201cThe UK government acknowledges the terrible suffering caused to the Finucane family by the appalling murder.\n\u201cIn 2012 the then Prime Minister David Cameron apologised for state collusion in the murder.\n\u201cWe will give careful consideration to the court\u2019s full written judgement and will make a decision without undue delay.\n\u201cWe are committed to transparency and openness, regardless of whether or not that may be uncomfortable, including for the government itself.\u201d",
    "A man whose luxury watch was stolen from his wrist while he ate at a central London restaurant says he wants to \"leave the country\" after an \"appalling failure\" by the Metropolitan Police to convict those responsible. \nLuca, who works in the finance industry and did not want to give his full name, said his Rolex watch was stolen off his wrist by three men while he was having dinner at a Chelsea restaurant in September last year.\nHe chased the suspects down the King's Road and caught one of the men, but says the Met Police was unable to gather CCTV footage of the crime and suggested that he drop the case over potential threats to his safety.\nA Met Police spokesperson said the force was \"sorry\" to hear the victim felt let down and remained \"regretful that we were not able to achieve justice in this case\".\nLuca said that in June an officer suggested he should drop the case because, if it went to court, the suspect would learn his identity and could therefore endanger his life due to \"potential retaliation\".\nHe says he was also told that if he pursued the case, the suspect would likely receive only \"a few hours of community service\" as a court sentence.\nLuca said there had been a \"complete failure of the system\" to catch those responsible for the crime, adding the Met Police could \"do better\".\nThe finance professional said the theft took place in the restaurant's \"outdoor terrace\" on Elystan Place at about 19:30 BST.\n\"Three people approached me,\" he said. \"In one millisecond the watch was gone.\"\nLuca said he chased the suspects for about a mile, pursuing them down the King's Road and detaining one of them as he jumped onto a bus.\nThat suspect was then arrested by the Met Police and released on bail the same night, Luca said.\nHe said the suspect failed to return for an interview and \"vanished\". \nThe finance professional added the Met Police failed to secure CCTV footage from the restaurant and other public areas from the night of the theft, and told him this was due to \"capacity and understaffing constraints\".\nHe said he had \u201ccompletely lost faith in the UK's police and justice system\u201d and was planning on moving out of the UK as a result of the way the incident had been treated by the force.\nA Met Police spokesperson called robbery an \"an awful crime\" that had \"a lasting impact on victims\".\n\"A senior member of the robbery team has spoken with the victim and explained that we have reviewed the case and where we have found areas of learning,\" they said.\n\"We are grateful that he gave us his time to speak about the issues raised but remain regretful that we were not able to achieve justice in this case.\"\nThe Met added there had been a number of issues resulting in CCTV not being secured and this fell below the standards that victims of crime should expect.\nThe force added Luca was not given enough clear communication about the way the criminal justice system worked, and apologised for this.\nIt said a senior officer from the robbery squad had since spoken to Luca about how the force could improve communication in the future.\nThe Met added that uniformed and plain-clothed officers proactively patrolled robbery \"hotspots\" to prevent them from happening.\nIt added Londoners wearing a high-value watch were urged to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "At least 121 people have been killed in a crush at a religious gathering in northern India, officials have said.\nThe incident took place at a satsang (a Hindu religious event) in Hathras district in Uttar Pradesh state.\nThe victims, including a large number of women and some children, are still being identified.\nSurvivors have described how the disaster unfolded as they tried to leave the event in Phulrai village.\nIt is not yet clear what led to the crush. Witnesses said the exit was too narrow and when people were leaving, a fierce dust storm led to confusion and panic, causing many people to become trampled.\nAn eyewitness, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC everything was \"going fine\", until \"all of a sudden I heard screams and before I knew it, people were falling on each other\".\n\"Many were crushed and I couldn't do much. I am just lucky to have survived.\" \n\"When the sermon finished, everyone started running out,\" a woman named only as Shakuntala told the Press Trust of India news agency.\n\"People fell in a drain by the road. They started falling one on top of the other and got crushed to death.\"\nUmesh Kumar Tripathi, chief medical officer from the neighbouring district of Etah, told reporters the \"stampede\" had left at least three children dead.\nA spokesperson for a senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh told the BBC it would  \"take hours to release the final tally\".\nDistressing images from the site are being circulated online. Some videos showed the injured being taken to hospitals in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even motorbikes. \nA clip seen by the BBC showed several bodies left at the entrance of a local hospital as relatives screamed for help.\n\"Such a huge accident has happened but not a single senior officer is present here,\u201d a relative in another video said. \u201cWhere is the administration?\"\nMr Kumar said the venue had been overcrowded, adding that a high-level committee had been formed to investigate the incident.\n\"The primary focus of the administration is to provide all possible help to the injured and kin of the deceased,\" he said. \nA video shared by news agency PTI showed the wounded being brought to a hospital for treatment.\n\"Procedure of post-mortem is under way and the matter is being investigated,\" official Satya Prakash in the neighbouring district of Etah said. \nIn Hathras, the screams of distraught family members can be heard in the local hospital. \nMany people are trying to find their loved ones, many bodies are unclaimed. \nThere is a shortage of ambulances \u2013 each one is bringing two to three bodies. Hathras is filled with despair and pain.\nAccidents are routinely reported at religious events in India, as huge crowds gather in tight spaces with little adherence to safety measures.\nIn 2018, around 60 people were killed after a train rammed into a crowd watching celebrations for Dusshera, a Hindu festival.\nIn 2013, a crush at a Hindu festival in the central state of Madhya Pradesh had killed 115 people.\nAdditional reporting by Abhishek Mathur in Hathras",
    "A scheme to check on police dog welfare has been rolled out in Wiltshire after a successful pilot in the north of England.\nThe Animal Welfare Scheme (AWS) involves volunteers visiting to check on the dogs in their police kennels, vehicles and the dog unit's training areas.\nThe volunteers will check on them every month to six weeks, and have said that, so far, they have not come across any problems with the \"well cared for\" animals.\nSgt Jon Harwood, from Wiltshire Police's dog unit, said he \"welcomed\" the scheme, adding: \"It's a nice opportunity for us to show off what we can do\".\nHe explained that the scheme will benefit the force and is an \"opportunity to learn from other areas\".\nThe Animal Welfare Scheme was set up as a result of a review of dog training after the death of Acer, a police dog, in 1997.\nAfter being successfully piloted by Lancashire Police, the scheme is now being rolled out in Wiltshire.\nSgt Harwood said that at the moment the main concern would be the environment day-to-day, like hot weather and dangerous circumstances.\n\"Ultimately we are in charge of that dog,\" he said.\n\"We don't deploy them if it's not safe.\"\nOne thing the force is now considering is a shaded area for the specialist cars that carry the dogs, so that they are not so reliant on inefficient air conditioning. \nLesley Peters and Jo Piddock have been chosen as volunteers for the scheme in Wiltshire because of their experience with dogs.\nMs Peters has been training dogs since she was a teenager and has worked with police and security, while Ms Piddock does agility and scent work with the animals.\nThe dog training and work is reward-based - and when they have done a job, they get their ball.\nDog handlers take their canine partners home with them, where they have special kennels and runs set up.\n\"You can tell by the way the dog is behaving if it's actually happy in the work it's doing,\" said Ms Piddock.\n\"Everything is great.

    "Collecting eggs from a two tonne rhino is far from easy - but the procedure is being carried out in zoos across Europe in a bid to help the wild population.\nThe hope is that cutting-edge fertility technology could boost the genetic diversity of southern white rhinos in Africa.\nThe species was almost extinct, plummeting to a few dozen rhinos  - so the animals are all descended from this tiny group.\nScientists believe rhinos in zoos, which have more genetic diversity because they are carefully cross bred, could widen the gene pool with the help of IVF.\nIt\u2019s technology that has seen a recent breakthrough: in January, researchers announced that they had achieved the world\u2019s first rhino IVF pregnancy.\nOne of the animals taking part in the southern white zoo project is 22-year-old Zanta from Dublin Zoo in Ireland. \n\u201cZanta has wonderful genetics that are worth preserving, but we know from a previous reproductive assessment that she can\u2019t breed,\u201d says Frank O\u2019Sullivan, a vet at the zoo.\n\u201cThe main reason we want to do the procedure is to bypass that, harvest her eggs and then they'll be fertilised. The great thing is Zanta will be represented in future generations of rhinos.\u201d\nA team of fertility specialists from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany has flown to Ireland to carry out the procedure.\nZanta is anaesthetized with a dart, then once she\u2019s fully sedated the scientists get to work.\nAmidst the regular beeps of the equipment monitoring Zanta\u2019s vital signs, the researchers cluster around a screen that\u2019s showing an ultrasound of the rhino\u2019s ovaries.\nShe\u2019s been given special hormone injections to help her produce eggs. The researchers are able to locate them inside follicles, small sacs of fluid, that appear as black circles on the screen.\nUsing an ultra-fine needle, and a great deal of precision, they are able to extract the eggs.\nIt\u2019s taken the team a long time to develop this technology.\nThe IVF pregnancy announced in January was in southern whites - with the team successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother.\nA calf was never born because the mother died from an unrelated bacterial infection early in the pregnancy. However, the scientists believe the pregnancy shows the technique is viable.\nTheir ultimate aim is to repeat this with the southern white rhino\u2019s all but extinct cousin - the northern white rhino - for a project called Biorescue. There are only two of these animals left on the planet - both of them females.\nBut the scientists believe the reproductive advances they\u2019ve made could also help with the southern white rhino\u2019s genetic problems.\nToday southern whites number in their thousands, but it wasn\u2019t always that way.\nAt the end of the 19th Century, the species was almost wiped out through hunting and land clearance. Some estimates suggest there were as few as 20 animals left.\nThe animals have slowly bounced back and now they are classified as near threatened, but starting off from this very small group has left them with a lack of genetic diversity.\nThis puts them at risk, says Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, the director of reproduction at Leibniz IZW.\n\u201cIf you have a very narrow gene pool, a virus, for example, can jump from one individual to the other because each individual is the same and the immune system acts like the same,\u201d he explained.\nSouthern whites in zoos, on the other hand, have more diversity because of the way their breeding is carefully planned.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to apply this new technology to rescue Zanta\u2019s genes and bring them back to Africa, so that we have a wider gene pool for the future,\u201d he says.\nIn a makeshift lab next to the rhino enclosure, the scientists peer intently into a microscope to assess what they\u2019ve collected.\nSusanne Holtze, part of the Leibniz team, says that they\u2019ve managed to harvest four eggs.  \nRhino IVF is still in its infancy - a calf has not yet been born from the technique - but the team is building a store of embryos made with eggs and sperm collected from across Europe and the hope is that they can one day be implanted into surrogates.\n\u201cIt's a lot of effort and in the end we actually come home with a few cells. But these cells have the potential to become embryos and to form a new rhino - a huge two tonne animal, so it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Dr Holtze said.\nBack in the enclosure, not long after the procedure has been completed, Zanta wakes up.\nShe\u2019s a little unsteady on her feet at first, but once everyone is sure she\u2019s OK, she heads outside. Her keeper calls her name and she soon strolls over for a gentle scratch behind her ears.\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t know it, the few eggs that she's donated could make a big difference, helping the survival of future generations of southern white rhinos.\n\nPhotos by Kevin Church ",
    "Inspectors have raised concerns around increased levels of violence, drugs, and the state of buildings at a prison.\nIndependent Monitoring Boards (IMB) also said HMP Huntercombe's leaking healthcare facility was not fit for purpose, though it said the prison was a safe environment as a whole.\nThe prison, near Henley on Thames, Oxfordshire, has housed foreign nationals since 2012.\nThe Prison Service said improvements were being made and that the healthcare building had been demolished, with staff moved to an alternative location.\nThe IMB's most recent annual report highlighted repeated and \"unacceptable\" problems with the 520-capacity prison's heating and hot water, which it said took up a \"great deal of senior staff time\" and a \"significant amount of public money\". \nIt also cited issues with ageing cell window mechanisms, many of which were broken, meaning window grilles had to be open or closed all the time, causing frustration in hot or cold weather.\nIt said the healthcare team worked well but noted there were several vacancies in the team covered by agency staff.\nOther issues raised were around prisoner-on-prisoner and prisoner-on-staff assaults. \nOn average, there were five violent incidents each month in 2023, the same as the previous year.\nThe report found there was evidence of alcohol being illicitly brewed in the prison, which \"occupies the time of several prisoners\".\nThe IMB was also concerned about the \"level of illicit items and drugs\" entering the prison, and the number of prisoners \"who appear to be under the influence of known and unknown substances\".\nHowever, the board said it observed a \"positive relationship between staff and prisoners on all wings\".\nIt welcomed the news that it had opened a new kitchen, providing a more varied food service.\nThe old kitchen was refurbished as a multi-faith centre, \"which will have a positive effect for prisoners where there is space pressure for Friday prayers\", the report said.\nThe prison holds inmates of 80 nationalities and 18 religions. Most are expected to be deported to their country of origin.\nThe jail has been holding weekly safety intervention meetings to help manage prisoners with challenging behaviour.\nA Prison Service spokesperson said: \"This report highlights the hard work of our dedicated staff at HMP Huntercombe in keeping the prison safe, supporting the most vulnerable prisoners and dealing with violent incidents professionally.\n\"But we know more needs to be done. That\u2019s why we\u2019re replacing boilers and heating, and improving security measures to stop illegal items that fuel violence entering the prison.\"\nFollow BBC South on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter, or\u00a0Instagram.

    "You've heard politicians talking about tax, immigration and the economy, but there's one topic they don't tend to mention.\nVideo games.\nThe UK's games industry is globally respected, employs an estimated 76,000 people and is thought to bring \u00a36bn a year to the UK economy.\nIt's also a sector in the middle of a crisis.\nOver the last 18 months thousands of workers worldwide have lost their jobs and studios have been shut down.\nMuch of the focus has been on big names such as Microsoft and Sony, both of which have laid off hundreds of staff in 2024.    \nBut smaller studios are feeling the pinch too.\n\"It\u2019s not great and I think it\u2019s pretty obvious,\" says Greg Lee.\n\"Every industry is struggling right now. But investment is drying up, people don\u2019t want to take the risk right now. \n\"And a lot of studios are suffering heavily because of that.\"\nGreg's the founder of Team Terrible, makers of viral hit indie horror game The Baby in Yellow.\nDescribed as a \"Lovecraftian babysitting game\" it's been downloaded millions of times.\nSince then, Team Terrible has moved into an office on Dundee's waterfront - a hub for game developers.\nIt grew out of 4J Studios, which found success developing Minecraft for mobiles and consoles.\nThe Scottish city has a rich gaming heritage and  - stop us if you've heard this one before - is the birthplace of Grand Theft Auto.\nThanks to its reputation and earlier investment in its development scene, Greg says, Dundee's a great place to make games.\n\"It's a very, very small city, which means that all the game studios know each other very well,\" he says.\n\"So there's definitely much more feeling of community, at local events you'll pretty much meet the entire range of all studios here. \n\"And I think that's really important. So it's very easy to find new talent because you know most of the people in the city and it's a really, really good place to grow because there's people around to support you.\"\nAccording to industry trade body UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) there are more than 2,000 gaming businesses in Britain.\nLike Dundee, towns and cities such as Manchester, Guildford, Cambridge and Brighton are home to clusters of large and small games developers. \nTeam Terrible staff Fergus Coyne and Jonathan Rodger say they've benefited from having other people in the industry close by.\n\"People nearby that share the same passion as you do, you're never feeling alone,\" says Jonathan, a Dundee native.\n\"You can talk to people about projects, you basically are fighting the same battles.\"\nBoth studied in the city before finding jobs in gaming, and say having a community around them is a bonus. \nBut Fergus, who's originally from Stirling, says the industry is a \"scary place\" at the moment, and believes more could be done to help developers.\n\"As of now, gaming's still not recognised as its own sector,\" he says.\n\"It's lumped in with the screen industry, which includes film and TV.\n\"So having it not recognised in its entirety doesn't really bode well for us feeling like we're being represented. \n\"There's more talking happening, but there's still been no concrete information coming through.\"\nBoth Labour and the Conservatives mention gaming in their manifesto plans for economic growth, but with no specific policies. \nThe SNP and Lib Dems say they want to rejoin the EU\u2019s Creative Europe scheme that could provide funding for studios.\nGreg says that he'd like to see politicians engage more with the games industry to go beyond a \"cookie cutter solution\". \n\"I think more investigation needs to be put in to see what individual studios need at different scales,\" he says.\nHe believes the UK's setup for supporting games companies is \"antiquated\" compared with countries such as Canada, and says he's seen a \"brain drain\" of talented people moving abroad where wages are higher.\n\"I think in order to reverse that we need to change policy to encourage students to set up here to give opportunities to bring back some of those developers to the UK,\" he says.\nDespite gaming becoming a bigger part of people's lives, UKIE CEO Nick Poole says, it's \"still getting relatively little airplay within the the national political dialogue\".\nHe says it's important for the UK to be \"at the forefront\" of the changing landscape \n\"We have a new Hollywood right on our shores,\" he says.\n\"The video game industry is global, the UK has an amazing heritage in that industry, we want it to have a really, really bright future in the industry as well. \n\"And so we need government to demonstrate that they care about the success of the UK video game sector.\"\nNick says UKIE wants parties to support developers through tax reliefs, introduce a \"digital creativity GCSE\" and for the next government to increase investment in the gaming sector. \nLike Greg, he wants to see support that's tailored towards the industry, rather than mirroring schemes set up for other creative fields such as film and TV.\n\"We really want to sit down with them and work with them on solutions th",
    "A number of Democratic lawmakers are calling on President Joe Biden to end his re-election campaign after his botched debate against Republican challenger Donald Trump.\nTwo weeks later, more than a dozen House representatives, one senator and leading donors including actor George Clooney have joined the growing chorus. \nA series of opinion polls since the debate suggest Trump may be edging ahead in key states.\nPresident Biden has continued to insist he's staying in the race, using an hour-long news conference to try to make his case. \nAs the pressure builds, attention has turned to who could replace him if he changes his mind about running.\n\nVarious scenarios could play out over the coming days and weeks, but there's two main ways Mr Biden's campaign could end: he could pull out willingly, or be forced to step aside by his own party.\nThe first option is more straightforward. \nMr Biden has won the support nearly all of the Democratic delegates who will vote at the party's convention in Chicago in August. If he steps down, they would be released to vote for another candidate. Whoever is able to win a majority of delegates at the convention would be the new nominee.\nThe second option would be much messier. \nDemocrats could change the rules and turn the convention into a free-for-all against the president's wishes. \nIf President Biden did voluntarily suspend his campaign, he might at the same time throw his support behind a possible successor. \nWho would be the leading contenders?\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris, who is already on the ticket, is an obvious and increasingly popular choice within the party to replace Mr Biden. \nAs his deputy, she has become the face of the administration's campaign to protect reproductive rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade. \nMs Harris has proved to be a loyal ally to the president and fiercely defended his debate performance. After the event, she admitted the president had a \"slow start\" but argued he went on to provide more substantive answers than Trump. \nDays after the debate, as concern grew about the president's ability to stay atop the ticket, Ms Harris reiterated her support for Mr Biden.  \n\u201cLook, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we\u2019re going to beat him again, period,\u201d she said Tuesday.\n\u201cI am proud to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate.\"\nMs Harris has the strong name recognition that comes from the job of vice- president, but has struggled with low approval ratings throughout her tenure. \nFifty-one percent of Americans disapprove of Ms Harris, while 37% approve, according to polling averages tracked by FiveThirtyEight. \nGretchen Whitmer, the two-term governor of Michigan, is an increasingly popular Midwest Democrat who many pundits speculate will run for president in 2028. \nShe has campaigned for Mr Biden in the past and has not been shy about her political aspirations. \nShe told the New York Times she wants to see a Generation X president in 2028, but stopped short of suggesting that she might fill that role. \nIn 2022, she led a campaign that left Michigan Democrats in control of the state's legislature and the governor's mansion. \nThat political control allowed her to enact a number of progressive policies including protecting Michigan abortion access and the passage of gun safety measures. \nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is one of the Biden administration's fiercest surrogates. He frequently appears on cable news networks praising Mr Biden. \nBut Mr Newsom has political ambitions of his own. \nHe is often listed as a possible 2028 candidate, but many Democratic pundits now say he could be a stand-in for Mr Biden. \nMr Newsom raised his national profile in recent years by being a key party messenger on conservative media, and via a debate against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year. \nHe was a top surrogate at Mr Biden's disastrous debate in Atlanta in June, and dodged several questions in the spin room about whether he would replace Mr Biden.\nFor now, he is publicly standing by the president. He travelled to Washington to attend a Wednesday meeting with Mr Biden and other top Democratic governors, and headlined a Biden campaign event in Michigan on the 4th of July holiday.\nIt is no secret that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations. \nHe ran for president in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden administration's best communicators. \nMr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as transportation secretary. \nHe helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022. \nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Mr Trump narrowly carried in 2016. \nThe governor, who previously served as the state's attorney general, has worked across party lines during his tenure. \nHe made national headlines last year after quic",

    "The head of Israel's spy agency Mossad, David Barnea, is reported to have travelled alone to Doha to meet Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani as momentum is again building over a possible ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas.\nThis appears to be very much a preliminary move in what could once again be a complicated series of discussions aimed at finally bridging the gap between the Israeli government and Hamas over what each defines as its bottom line in what any potential deal would comprise.\nAfter Mr Barnea left Doha, the office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said gaps still remained between the two sides. Israeli officials had already said that expectations need to be lowered.\nThe latest rekindling of hope for a deal came after Hamas delivered its response to the three-phase proposal that President Biden set out several weeks ago.  \nThe key to that formulation was to put off what has long appeared to be the main obstacle in either side accepting a deal - the demand by Hamas that there must be a permanent ceasefire and the counter-demand by Israel that it must have the freedom to resume fighting in Gaza if necessary.\nExactly what Hamas has presented has not yet been made public.  But the Israeli response appears far more positive than in other instances in the past seven months when the process has regained momentum.  A source in Israel's negotiating team said that the proposal put forward by Hamas included a \"very significant breakthrough\".\nThere are indications that this could be that Hamas has accepted the key point of the proposal announced by President Biden - that it would allow negotiations to achieve its goal of a permanent end to the war through the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, rather than demanding it as the starting point.\nHamas has throughout bridled at its portrayal by the US in particular as the main stumbling block in agreeing a deal. Should it become clear that it has indeed made this concession, then the ball would be firmly back in the court of Mr Netanyahu.\nAt no time has he personally yielded an inch in his public commitment to the complete eradication of Hamas - and Israel's right to continue fighting in Gaza after any ceasefire. He has resisted all pressure from inside and outside Israel to modify that stance. \nBut the pressure has been building on him from all sides, inexorably.\nThe latest push seems to have come from within his own military. A recent article in the New York Times, citing unnamed current and former security officials, said that Israel's top generals \"want to begin a ceasefire in Gaza even if it keeps Hamas in power for the time being\".\nMr Netanyahu dismissed this as defeatist. But he may not be able to resist such pressure forever - nor the ever growing anger on the streets of Israel from those who want the remaining hostages in Gaza to be brought home now.\nFor Hamas, there are also some signs of growing despair over the continuing war by those who suffer from it every day, the civilian population of Gaza.  And internationally, the patience of mediators, like Egypt and Qatar, may be running out.  \nRegional countries that wholeheartedly support the Palestinian cause have also been reported to be putting increasing pressure on Hamas to accept a deal. Its leadership may feel that the group's apparent survival, even if severely degraded both politically and militarily, may be victory enough.\nAnd for the international community, the need to find some end to the war has grown even more urgent with the spectre of the confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah potentially erupting into all-out war. A ceasefire in Gaza could potentially ease those tensions.\nAnd for the Biden administration - still reeling in the aftermath of last week's debate between the president and Donald Trump - a diplomatic success here would be a much-needed boost.\nAll these elements suggest that the hopes that have once again been raised may this time finally prove more resilient to the negative factors that have seen them dashed before.",
    "Steel from Gladiators is promoting a \"healthy mindset\" for youngsters after admitting he used to be overweight as a child and had little confidence. \nThe athlete, real name Zack George, is now a CrossFit champion and a familiar face for fans of the Saturday night BBC TV show, but said he used to eat sweets and chocolate \"every single day\". \nSteel, 33, from Leicester, visited a West Yorkshire primary school on Monday to help encourage students to make healthier choices and boost self-esteem.\nHe told the BBC: \"It's a passion of mine to show kids how to eat well, exercise and have a good mindset.\"\nSteel told children at Holy Trinity Church of England Primary School, Halifax, he used to eat junk food \"four or five times a week\" but loved watching Gladiators on TV and saw them as \"superheroes\". \nHe drew abs on his stomach, he said, in a bid to look like his on-screen idols. \n\"They could do all these games and looked in great shape and I said to myself - I want to be a Gladiator,\" he said.\n\"So I started eating better and started to train to try and live my dream.\"\nSteel co-founded an initiative aimed at improving health and wellbeing in UK schools, featuring workshops for children aged three to 16.\nHe said: \"You can see some of the kids who come into the workshops have low confidence, their heads are down, their shoulders are rolled over and they're really quiet. \n\"By the end their chests are up, backs are straight and they're smiling - so that makes it worthwhile.\"\nHe added: \"It's really important to use the platform we have for the greater good.\" \nSteel is one of the new generation of Gladiators to star in the BBC One revamp of the hit 90s show, filmed at the Utilita Arena Sheffield. \nSchool head teacher Sarah Huby said you could \"sense the excitement\" that a real-life Gladiator was visiting the school. \n\"It's something they will always remember,\" she said.\n\"We want our children to grow up to be happy and healthy - the world is very different now and we need to prepare them for that.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "A police officer has been dismissed after being found to be in possession of cocaine and supplying a member of the public with police information.\nTwo bags containing the Class A drug were found in former Gloucestershire PC Ben Humphries' bedside cabinet during an authorised police search in September 2022.\nHis phone was seized, revealing messages detailing his cocaine use and sharing information about a man's arrest with his dealer.\nChief constable Rod Hansen found Humphries' conduct amounted to gross misconduct and justified dismissal at a hearing last month.\nHumphries accepted a conditional caution on 11 September 2023 for having a trace amount of cocaine in his possession on 12 September 2022.\nA search of his bedroom was authorised under section 32 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, with officers attending Humphries' address to arrest him on suspicion of corrupt or improper exercise of police powers.\nHis mobile phone was seized, with the majority of allegations against him stemming from the download.\nMessages written by Humphries' regarding his cocaine use began in November 2019. \nIn January 2021, Humphries described his relationship with cocaine as \"a long term thing I wanna change\".\nHe referred to having a big issue with \"coke\", understood by a drug expert at Gloucestershire Constabulary to relate to cocaine, and doing \"nose beers\" in August 2022.\nNine days before being found to possess cocaine, Humphries messaged a contact with information regarding a man's arrest, before asking the contact to supply him with \"a bag\".\nFour allegations made against Humphries as part of the case were proved.\nThese included providing police information for non-policing purposes, and possessing and consuming cocaine on various occasions over a lengthy period of time.\nIt was also proved that Humphries had been in possession of cocaine on 12 September 2022, and committing a crime by accepting a conditional caution for possession of cocaine.\nChief Constable Hansen found Humphries in breach of three standards of professional behaviour: honesty and integrity, discreditable conduct, and confidentiality.\nAfter taking note of Home Office Guidance, Chief Constable Hansen found the behaviour amounted to gross misconduct.\nHe said: \"Police officers are expected to work towards eliminating the trade of illicit drugs. \n\"By obtaining cocaine over a period of years, PC Humphries furthered the trade of illicit drugs rather than eliminating it.\"\nHe added Humphries \"knowingly consumed\" a Class A drug despite being \"well aware through his role\" that it was \" a serious matter and criminal offence\".\n\"Taking these matters together, my decision is that the officer\u2019s breaches of the standards of professional behaviour are so serious as to justify dismissal,\" he said.\n\"Accordingly, I find that the conduct of former PC Humphries amounts to gross misconduct.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A popular knob-throwing contest is making a comeback after a five-year hiatus.\nThe Dorset Knob Throwing Games, where people compete to hurl the county's traditional biscuits the furthest, were last held in 2019.\nThe event, which started in Cattistock, attracted 8,000 people and organisers said it had \"reached such a size that it cannot be run by a small village committee\".\nContestants will finally get a chance to battle it out in 2024 as part of the Cattistock Countryside Show, held near Chilfrome on Sunday.\nThe Dorset Knob Throwing event began as a fundraiser for the village of Cattistock in 2008.\nLocals needed to make some money to keep and upgrade their cricket club, football club, playing fields and village hall as well as replace sporting equipment.\nSo far, the event has raised more than \u00a350,000 for the village.\nThe aim of the game is to throw the Dorset knob the furthest distance.\nContestants are allowed to launch three biscuits, with the furthest measured by an umpire.\nParticipants must only use the knobs provided by the event and each attempt must be thrown under-arm and from a marked standing point.\nFollowing choking concerns, organisers decided not to hold a knob-eating contest this year.\nJames Vincent-Smith won the Dorset Knob Throwing competition in 2019, with a world record of 31.9m (105ft).\nHe said: \u201cI found the festival when I was in Swanage on a long weekend and I was looking at events nearby. \n\"I saw Dorset Knob Throwing which, having a bit of a misspent youth throwing stones, mostly at beaches, I thought this is something I could go along and potentially win.\u201d\nOriginally from Devon and now living in Rochester, James said he was surprised a Dorset local did not win the competition.\n\u201cI feel like I took the title away from them,\" he said, adding: \"I think people who live in the county and near the coast should be good at throwing things but clearly Devon people have the edge.\"\nThe champion is returning to Dorset for this year's competition in an attempt to retain his title.\n\u201cWithout a doubt, I plan on winning this year\u2019s Dorset Knob Throwing competition,\" he said.\nThe thrice-cooked biscuit is not just thrown - people also enjoy them as a snack.\nThat is how bakery company Moores say the Dorset knob started in the 1800s.\nAt the end of each day, bakers would mix the leftover dough with butter and sugar to make into small round portions called buttons.\nSimilar to a rusk, the Dorset knob is quite dry and is often eaten with butter or cheese.\nTraditionally, they are also dipped in tea or cider. They can also be paired with honey and cream, known locally as thunder and lightning.\nBlandford-born Louise Denton-Haydock, a lover of Dorset knobs, said she liked eating them with lots of cheese and butter.\n\u201cI heard that the knob-throwing festival got very popular, but it is back this year, so I hope it goes well for the organisers,\u201d she said.\nChef Owen Gower from Joey\u2019s Family Food in Dorchester described the biscuits as \"light and airy\".\nHe added: \u201cI would probably use the Dorset knob as a giant crouton in a stew or something to soak up all the juices to make them a little bit less crunchy.\u201d\nMichael Quinn, owner of Quinn's Butchers, said he would indulge in a Dorset knob occasionally.\n\"I would pair it with a Dorchester Quinn's Butchers' faggot or some nice local pastrami and cheese.\u201d\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A campaigner has criticised delays in settling civil cases related to pupils abused at King Charles' former school.\nJohn Findlay, a former pupil of Gordonstoun in Moray and who was abused at its associated junior school, Aberlour House, said some people had already waited six years for a resolution. \nLast month, the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry (SCAI) said child abuse had been allowed to flourish unchecked for decades at Gordonstoun.\nThe school has apologised to anyone who was abused while in its care.\nMr Findlay, who was 12 when he was sexually assaulted by a teacher in 1990, secured a six-figure payout in 2022.\nHe said the compensation had helped to cover the cost of his care for clinically severe post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression.\nMr Findlay said he knew of two other people seeking payouts, adding that compensation could be vital to them getting help for mental health issues.\nTheir cases relate to former Gordonstoun teacher Andrew Keir.\nKeir was jailed for a year in 2018 for lewd acts involving pupils at swimming sessions.\nMr Findlay said: \"When those things are so deep-rooted in your psyche it takes very specialist care and specialist therapy.\"\nHe added: \"I had hoped my case would make other people have quicker access to help.\n\"It's horrendous for people who have been abused that their suffering is prolonged.\n\"My friends have been suffering for six years and that is evil in my mind.\"\nLast month, SCAI chairwoman Lady Smith published her findings into residential care for children at Gordonstoun and Aberlour House, near Elgin.\nShe concluded that children who boarded at both establishments were exposed to risks of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse - and that for many those risks materialised.\nLady Smith said: \"I have no difficulty in finding that children were abused at Gordonstoun and Aberlour in a variety of ways over a long period of time.\"\nGordonstoun said the SCAI report was upsetting, adding that it was shocking that the impact of abuse experienced in the past had endured for those affected for 30 to 40 years, and for some even 50 years.\nThe school said the report had also recognised its efforts to assist former pupils who had suffered abuse.\nPrincipal Lisa Kerr said: \u201cWe are sorry that John suffered abuse during his time at Aberlour House in 1990 and we have apologised to him in person.\n\u201cWe respect and thank those, like John, who have spoken up about their experiences and those who gave evidence to the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry.\"\nShe added: \u201cWe have actively encouraged those affected by abuse, who feel they will benefit from financial redress, to seek this. \n\"Those claims are then dealt with by the insurers of Gordonstoun and Aberlour House. \n\"We will continue to signpost legal advice and provide support information for those affected by historic abuse.\"\nMs Kerr said Gordonstoun had written and spoken to the insurers, urging them to deal with cases in a timely and compassionate way.\nShe said: \u201cWe are acutely conscious that delays add to the distress of survivors and will continue to press for these claims to be resolved as quickly as possible.\u201d\nGordonstoun was founded in 1934 by a German Jewish educationist, Kurt Hahn, after he fled the Nazis.

    "Of all the bold announcements a brand-new government would like to be making, the early release of prisoners surely isn\u2019t among them.\nBut on Friday ministers will say that some offenders in England and Wales will be let out after they\u2019ve completed 40% of their sentences, the BBC has confirmed. Currently prisoners serving standard determinate sentences - that is, those with a fixed end date - are released after serving 50%.\nThis change in policy won\u2019t include serious criminals such as sex offenders, rapists and terrorists. Instead, shoplifters and those convicted of drugs offences are among those likely to be released sooner. \nSources say it will most likely amount to a number in the low thousands leaving prison early in the coming weeks and months.\nIt\u2019s a short-term fix that will free up cells quickly. And it\u2019s happening because there simply aren\u2019t enough resources to cope with the rising number of people being locked up.\nThere have been numerous warnings, including from the Prisons\u2019 Governors' Association, that the estate was \u201cjust days away\u201d from reaching full capacity. On 5 July official figures showed the prison population was 87,453 out of a total capacity of 88,864 - meaning there were just 1,411 spaces left.\nA member of staff at HMP Wandsworth in south-west London, one of the worst-affected prisons, told me that it was \u201cbursting at the seams\u201d and officers were having to put prisoners in cells that should have been taken out of action.\n\u201cWe put two inmates in a cell where the toilet was overflowing,\u201d the member of staff said. \u201cWe had nowhere else to put them\u2026 The smell was so bad you couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d\nThe previous Conservative government had already resorted to emergency measures to deal with the crisis. At first, some inmates were let out under supervision up to 18 days early and later, as the situation grew even more dire, up to 70 days early.\nThen in October last year, the Ministry of Justice stopped all non-essential maintenance work because it couldn\u2019t afford to close cells at a time when every space was needed.\nTwo factors in particular have driven the growth in prison numbers. The number of people on remand has risen by 84% since 2019 and now accounts for 20% of the overall prison population, according to the Institute for Government think tank. And the proportion of those being recalled after breaching the terms of their licence has also risen sharply \u2013 up 72% since 2019.\nBoth these factors have been fuelled by a post-Covid backlog in the criminal courts, which has meant people waiting for a lot longer for hearings and trials.\nAlso, even though recorded crime has fallen according to the Office for National Statistics, changes in sentencing policy have contributed to more and longer custodial sentences.\nAsked by reporters during his visit to Washington DC what he had discovered now he was in office, Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, said that \u201csome of what we have found is shocking\u201d and singled out prisons in particular. He added that \u201cthe situation is worse than I thought it was\u201d.\nHowever, meetings between Labour and officials about how to tackle the looming crisis began weeks ago, during the election campaign.\nArguably, Labour's anticipated early-release policy is in line with the views of the newly appointed prisons minister. James Timpson told Channel 4 News earlier this year that a third of inmates shouldn\u2019t be in prison in the first place.\nOvercrowding has exacerbated many of the problems at the heart of the penal system. Too many inmates means less attention on rehabilitation, prison staff have persistently told me, because staff are spread more thinly. This affects their ability to provide work and training for inmates.\nMost inmates are eventually released, and how they\u2019re treated inside can shape their behaviour once they\u2019re out in the community - charites such as the Prison Reform Trust vigorously argue for better conditions partly for this very reason.\nBut there are pitfalls to the government\u2019s plan. Critics warn that it won\u2019t make overcrowding go away and that early releases could in fact create new problems.\nLast year Charlie Taylor, the chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales, described the issue of overcrowding as a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d but warned early releases would not be enough to prevent it \u201cblowing up\u201d.\nFor instance, early releases have a knock-on effect for the Probation Service. When offenders on determinate sentences are released early, they are supervised by probation officers and must adhere to certain conditions, such as sticking to curfews.\nBut the Probation Service is already struggling with its workload. A report published by the HM Inspectorate of Probation earlier in the year said senior probation officers \u201chad too many responsibilities which get in the way of their focus on the quality of work delivered by their teams\u201d.\nJason Barnfarther, 23, who recently served time in prison for drug offences, described being told he was to be released sooner than e",
    "A south-west London pupil with cancer is being helped to keep up with school lessons by an interactive robot.\nHoward's school attendance had dropped below 50% after he started intensive weekly chemotherapy in January, following his diagnosis of a rare kind of arm cancer in December.\nBut since then, the 12-year-old, who attends a school in Twickenham, was introduced to an interactive avatar and audio visual robot called 'AV Howard' and he has been able to attend lessons from home or hospital by sending his electronic double in his place.\nTeachers and students have even undergone \"robot training\" to help them integrate AV Howard into lessons. \nHoward says although living with his tumour is \"painful\", \"having AV Howard has made a really big impact for someone like me, who cares about their school\".\nAV Howard's camera allows him to read books and worksheets, and he can talk to the class through an in-built speaker. \nHis fellow students take turns to carry the robot between lessons so he is able to join in with the rest of the class.\n\"It feels quite good because we're doing the right thing for a good cause, and to be able to help him is an honour,\" student Cambell said.\n\"It's really fun when he's on, when you're taking him through the corridor, because everyone is like, 'Hi AV Howard!' which is really nice to see,\" student and family friend Juliette said.\nHeadteacher Martin O'Sullivan added: \"For a student that's got that level of medical treatment, the fact that they're not in school regularly, it's not only about them falling behind in what they're learning. \n\"Not being part of something on a regular basis is not good for their wellbeing, for their mental health. \n\"For students who can't access education for whatever variety of reasons, this is going to be the future.\"\nThe robot was sourced from Chartwell Children\u2019s Cancer Trust by the charity Momentum, which offers support to children and their families facing serious illness and has been helping Howard and his family.\nMomentum is hopeful more children can be helped by the robot technology. \n\"We really try to get to know the family to find out what they need,\" Emma Searle, a family support manager at Momentum said. \n\"One of Howard's needs was accessing his education, which was really important to him, so we were able to put in that referral to Chartwell Children's Cancer Trust for one of the robots\".\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "As IT updates go, this was about as nerve-wracking as things can get.\nIn February, deep inside a warehouse at Cern, the Swiss home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest science experiment \u2013 two network engineers held their breath. And pressed a button.\nSuddenly, text on a black background flashed up on a screen in front of them. It had worked. \u201cThere was high-fiving involved,\u201d recalls Joachim Opdenakker at SURF, a Dutch IT association that works for educational and research institutions. \u201cIt was super-cool to see.\u201d\nHe and his colleague Edwin Verheul had just set up a new data link between the LHC in Switzerland and data storage sites in The Netherlands.\nA data link that could reach speeds of 800 gigabits per second (Gbps) \u2013 or more than 11,000 times the average UK home broadband speed. The idea is to improve scientists\u2019 access to the results of LHC experiments.\nA subsequent test in March using special equipment on loan from Nokia proved the desired speeds were achievable.\n\u201cThis transponder that Nokia uses, it\u2019s like a celebrity,\u201d says Mr Verheul, explaining how the kit is booked up for use at various locations in advance. \u201cWe had limited time to do tests. If you have to postpone a week, then the transponder is gone.\u201d\nThis amount of bandwidth, approaching one terabit per second, is extremely fast but some subsea cables are a few hundred times faster still \u2013 they use multiple fibre strands to achieve such speeds.\nIn labs around the world, networking experts are coming up with fibre optic systems capable of pushing data around even more rapidly than this. They are reaching extraordinary speeds of many petabits per second (Pbps), or 300 million times the average UK home broadband connection.\nThis is so fast that one can barely imagine how people will use such bandwidth in the future. But engineers are wasting no time in proving that it is possible. And they only want to go faster.\nThe duplex cable (with cores that either send or receive) from Cern to data centres in The Netherlands is just shy of 1,650km (I,025 miles) long, snaking from Geneva to Paris, then Brussels, and finally Amsterdam. Part of the challenge in reaching 800 Gbps was in beaming pulses of light such a long way. \u201cDue to the distance, the power levels of that light decrease, so you have to amplify it at different locations,\u201d explains Mr Opdenakker.\nEvery time one tiny subatomic particle smashes into another during experiments at the LHC, the impact generates staggering volumes of data \u2013 about one petabyte per second. That\u2019s enough to fill 220,000 DVDs.\nThis is slimmed down for storage and study, but still requires hefty amounts of bandwidth. Plus, with an upgrade due by 2029, the LHC expects to produce even more scientific data than it does today.\n\u201cThe upgrade increases the number of collisions by at least a factor of five,\u201d says James Watt, senior vice president and general manager of optical networks at Nokia.\nA time when 800 Gbps seems slow may not be far away, however. In November, a team of researchers in Japan broke the world speed record for data transmission when they reached an astonishing 22.9 Pbps. That\u2019s enough bandwidth to supply every single person on the planet, and then a couple billion more, with a Netflix stream, says Chigo Okonkwo at Eindhoven University of Technology, who was involved in the work.\nIn this case, a meaningless but huge stream of pseudorandom data was beamed over 13km of coiled fibre optic cable in a lab setting. Dr Okonkwo explains that the integrity of the data is analysed post-transfer to confirm it was sent as quickly as reported without accumulating too many errors.\nHe also adds that the system he and colleagues used relied on multiple cores \u2013 a total of 19 cores inside one fibre cable. This is a new type of cable unlike the standard ones that connect many people\u2019s home to the internet.\nBut older fibre is expensive to dig up and replace. Extending its lifetime is useful, argues Wladek Forysiak at Aston University in the UK. He and colleagues have recently achieved speeds of around 402 terabits per second (Tbps) along a 50km-long optical fibre with just one core. That\u2019s about 5.7 million times faster than the average UK home broadband connection.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a world best, we don\u2019t know of any results that are better than that,\u201d says Prof Forysiak. Their technique relies on using more wavelengths of light than usual when flashing data down an optical line.\nFor this they use alternative forms of the electronic equipment that sends and receives signals over fibre optic cables but such a setup could be easier to install than replacing thousands of kilometres of the cable itself.\nActivities in the so-called metaverse might one day require extreme bandwidth, suggests Martin Creaner, director general of the World Broadband Association. His organisation expects home broadband connections to reach up to 50 Gbps by 2030.\nBut reliability may be even more important than speed for some applications.",
    "Hundreds of British workers will be given greater choice over their hours as part of a new pilot by the official four-day week campaign.\nThe six-month project will build on the original 2022 trial, with employers also trying flexible start and finish times, a nine-day fortnight, and compressed hours.\nSix businesses have already signed up and the campaign\u2019s director told the BBC it is hoping to target around 3,000 employees and 50 companies.\nThe UK\u2019s biggest union Unison and several big firms support the experiment, but other companies have abandoned the four-day week after trying it.\nThe campaign\u2019s director Joe Ryle said \"hundreds of British companies and one local council have already shown a four-day week with no loss of pay can be a win-win for workers and employers\".\nThe campaign is backed by research from Cambridge University and Boston College, with Welsh community housing landlord Bron Afon Community Housing one of the first companies to sign up to the latest trial.\nDirector Unji Mathur said she has already been \"impressed\" by the impact a shorter working week has had on organisations' performance, as well as employees' wellbeing and retention.\nShe added that she sees the trial as a chance to help improve employees' work-life balance.\nThe campaign group said that \"at least\" 54 of the 61 companies that took part have maintained the four-day week a year and a half after the original trial.\nSophie Greaves works with flexible start and end times at her research chemist role in Liverpool.\nShe can clock in anytime between 07:00 and 10:00 Monday to Friday and leave when her shift finishes eight hours later.\nShe believes the flexibility is good for days when you want to start later, or if you wake up early and are \"twiddling your thumbs\" at home.\n\"People really are productive if they can manage their own time,\" she says.\nAsda, however, shelved a four-day week trial last week after staff complained that their longer shifts were too demanding.\nUnder its plans, store managers worked 45 hours across four days. Other parts of the trial, which included working 39 hours across five days, were more popular.\nMorrisons also abandoned the four-day week for staff at its corporate office in Bradford in January.\nStaff were required to work 37.5 hours across four days with occasional Saturday shifts.\nResponding to Morrisons' decision, Mr Ryle said this was \"not really a four-day week\", which he defines as 32 hours across four days.\nMeanwhile, some companies are trying another direction. Earlier this month, Greece introduced a six-day working week for certain industries in a bid to boost productivity and economic growth in turn.\nIt only applies to businesses which operate 24-hours a day and is optional for workers, who get paid an extra 40% for the overtime they do.\nMr Ryle will present the results of this second trial to the newly-elected Labour government next year.\n\"With a new Labour government, change is in the air and we hope to see employers embracing this change by signing up to our pilot,\" he said.",

    "Potential Tory leadership contender Suella Braverman has said her party must win back Reform UK voters if it is to recover from its crushing election defeat.\nThe former home secretary, tipped to run in the contest to replace Rishi Sunak, said Nigel Farage's party posed an \"existential threat\" to the Tories.\nWarning that her party no longer had the \"luxury of a monopoly\" over right-wing voters, she added it needed to do more focus on \u201ccore Conservative policies\u201d.\nBut other senior Tories have cautioned against moving to the right, as the party seeks to recover from its lowest-ever base of MPs.\nTory Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said that embracing Reform UK could prolong the party's stretch in opposition by \"many, many years\".\n\"Nobody in the Conservative Party that I\u2019ve personally spoken to thinks that\u2019s a good idea,\" he added.\nThe Conservatives now have only 121 MPs, down 251, after an election drubbing that has posed big questions for the future direction of the party.\nThe Conservative vote dropped from 13.9m at the last election in 2019 to just 6.8m.\nReform UK, whose platform included a freeze on \"non-essential immigration\" and scrapping net zero rules, won won 4.1m votes and five MPs.\nHarrow East MP Bob Blackman has been chosen as the new chairman of the 1922 backbench committee, which sets the rules for the party leadership contest, replacing longtime chairman Sir Graham Brady, who did not stand for re-election as an MP.\nNo Conservative MPs have yet announced their candidacy, with a debate under way over when and how the contest should take place.\nAlongside Mrs Braverman, other possible leadership contenders include former ministers Kemi Badenoch, James Cleverly, Tom Tugendhat, and Priti Patel.\nTwo other former ministers, Robert Jenrick and Victoria Atkins, appeared on the Sunday political shows to offer their views on the future of the party, in a sign they are also thinking of running.\nMeanwhile, shadow home secretary Mr Cleverly has called for the party to \"unite\" and \"get our act together\". \nIn an article for the Times newspaper, he said the Tories had \"lost our well-deserved reputation for competence and good government\" as the party was \"too often preoccupied with infighting\". \nHe said the party \"has always been at its best when it embraces being a broad church\". \n\"We lost voters to the left and the right, and we won\u2019t win them all back if we narrow our offer,\" he added. \nThe Conservative post-mortem began at a Westminster conference of Popular Conservatism, the right-wing faction launched earlier this year by former PM Liz Truss, who lost her seat at last week's election.\nSpeaking via video link from another right-wing conference in the US, Mrs Braverman urged the party to take a tougher line on immigration, cutting regulations and insulating government bodies from the \u201clunatic woke virus\u201d.\nShe said the rise of Reform UK was \"all our own fault\", as the Conservatives had failed to address \u201cout of control population growth\u201d in recent years.\nShe added that the party should also leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), arguing it had prevented ministers from tackling illegal migration.\nShe said Mr Farage's party, which began life less than five years ago as the Brexit Party, had succeeded in winning over \"many of our traditional lifelong voters\", posing \"an existential threat to us electorally\".\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good denigrating Reform voters. It\u2019s no good smearing the Reform party,\" she added. \n\u201cThey are now their voters, and we need to do everything we can to win them back.\"\nFormer cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, who also lost his seat last week, offered a similar solution, arguing the \"Conservative family\", including Reform UK, had won 11 million votes combined at last week's poll.\nHe added that the result was an \"alarm bell against the arrogance of presumption that we thought we had a divine right to rule and a divine right to certain voters\".\n\"We didn't.

    "Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people in Scotland have not received the latest Covid booster as part of the spring vaccination campaign, BBC Scotland analysis of official health figures shows.\nIt comes as the latest figures show deaths from Covid continue to rise.\nThe figures from Public Health Scotland show 49 deaths in the week beginning 1 July, with almost three-quarters of them in the over-75 age group.\nThe vaccine data shows almost 260,000 at-risk people - including the elderly, those in care homes and those with weakened immune systems - had not received the latest booster by the programme\u2019s end date on 30 June.\nThe Scottish government said some health boards are still vaccinating people who were unable to come forward during the spring campaign.\nThe spring booster programme, which followed the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance, prioritised vaccination for adults living in care homes, people aged 75 and above and those with weakened immune systems.\nThose with weakened immune systems had the lowest spring booster vaccination take-up with more than half (54.5%) not receiving the booster - more than 105,000 people.\nAmong the over-75s, more than a quarter (27.3%) - 147,000 people - had not received the jab.\nMore than 6,000 care home residents had not had the booster, representing 18.7% of those eligible.\nThe figures cover the period up to 7 July 2024.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde had the greatest proportion of eligible people not vaccinated with a spring booster, the figures showed.\nIn total 41% of those eligible in the health board area had not received the booster, representing almost 54,000 people.\nNHS Lanarkshire, which had 40.2% not taking up the booster and NHS Western Isles had 39.8%, were the next highest.\nAdditional figures out from Public Health Scotland show there were 459 acute hospital admissions due to Covid in the week ending 7 July, a slight drop on the previous week\u2019s figure when 462 were reported.\nProf Antonia Ho, clinical senior consultant in infectious diseases, at the University of Glasgow, said the latest Covid wave was likely to be due to new variants and waning immunity from vaccination and infection.\nShe said: \u201cI think it\u2019s disappointing that the number of people that have taken up the spring booster has declined and I think that\u2019s true across the country.\u201d\nIn England there is a similarly low uptake of the spring booster. Data published by the UK Health Security Agency shows 37.7% of eligible people did not receive the spring vaccine, as of 3 July.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a very good handle on how much infection there is because there is so little testing now. We\u2019re only seeing the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Prof Ho added.\n\u201cCovid hasn\u2019t settled down into a winter seasonality like other respiratory viruses like flu or RSV so we\u2019re seeing waves outside of winter and the wave is causing severe disease in some individuals as some people are being admitted to hospital.\n\u201cWe know vaccines are the best armour that we have to fight against severe disease and hospital admissions but immunity from vaccines doesn\u2019t last very long and that\u2019s why we need to keep giving boosters.\u201d\nDeath registration data published by the National Records of Scotland also shows Covid-related deaths have increased.\nIn the week beginning 1 July, 49 Covid-related deaths were registered in Scotland, a 53.1% increase on the previous week\u2019s figures when 32 were registered.\nOf the registered deaths 35 (71.4%) were aged 75 or above.\nIn total 555 deaths have been registered in Scotland this year. The deaths had Covid as either an underlying cause or as a contributory cause of death.\nA spokesperson for the Scottish government said: \u201cThose at extreme high risk from Covid-19, such as stem cell transplant patients and the severely immunosuppressed, can access vaccinations year-round via local clinical referral procedures.\n\u201cAlthough the programme ended on 30 June, some health boards are vaccinating those who were unable to come forward during the programme, until 14 July,\" the spokesperson said.\n\u201cWe encourage those eligible, who are yet to be vaccinated, to check with their local health board.\u201d",

    "A motorcycle dealership owner from Wakefield has avoided prison after he admitted defrauding customers out of \u00a333,000.\nMartin Bleasby, 43, ran East Yorkshire Motorcycle World in Hutton Cranswick, near Driffield, with his wife until the company entered administration in 2018.\nHull Crown Court heard on Wednesday that the businessman sold used motorbikes on behalf of nine owners who never received any of the profits.\nHe pleaded guilty to nine counts of fraud after Judge Tahir Khan advised him he would suspend a custodial sentence if a trial was averted.\nProsecuting counsel Julia Smart KC told the court that Bleasby collected motorcycles by manufacturers such as Honda and Kawasaki from customers' homes and told them he would take a 10% commission from the onward sale price.\nHowever, some of the bikes' owners went months before they heard anything from the dealership, and several of them had to visit the showroom to ask about the money they were due to receive.\nThe nine victims were given \"different excuses\" by Bleasby and his wife as to why the payments had not been processed.\nAfter one man visited the dealership, his debit card was credited with the amount owed from the sale of his motorcycle, but the sum was later removed from his account and he was never reimbursed.\nAnother victim was told the bike he had handed to Bleasby was \"in the workshop\" after it had already been sold to someone else.\nTwo others were offered gift vouchers in lieu of money and one was told that Bleasby was unable to deal with his complaint as he was suffering from gout and a slipped disc.\nBleasby was arrested in 2019 and gave \"no comment\" answers during a police interview.\nDefending, Andrew Campbell KC told the court that there was \"no deliberate intent\" to commit fraud from the outset, and that after Bleasby had called in administrators to liquidate East Yorkshire Motorcycle World, the landlord had taken possession of the premises and he had been unable to sell stock to pay creditors.\nHe added that his client did not live an \"extravagant lifestyle\" and had not taken money out of the business.\nBleasby, of Wilson Drive in Wakefield, has been running other businesses since the offending and offered to pay compensation to the nine victims once a figure was finalised.\nJudge Khan described Bleasby as a \"reformed character\" after reading two positive testimonials, and said he would disregard \"old\" convictions for handling stolen goods and disorder when handing him a 15-month prison sentence suspended for two years.\nA compensation order was also made by the court.\nEast Yorkshire Motorcycle World held meets and events for bikers and had a cafe.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

    "More than 50 candidates and activists in France have come under physical attack in the run-up to Sunday's tense final round of parliamentary elections, Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin has said.\nHe revealed the figure after government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot, her deputy Virginie Lanlo and a party activist were brutally assaulted as they put up election posters in Meudon, south-west of Paris.\nThe motive for the attack is not clear, but Ms Thevenot returned to Meudon on Thursday with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who condemned what he called \"attacks of intolerable cowardice\".\nThe spate of assaults across France reflects the febrile mood on the final day of campaigning in an election that the far-right National Rally (RN) is poised to win.\nAlthough RN is well ahead in the polls, 217 candidates have dropped out from local run-off races so another candidate has a better chance of stopping them winning an outright majority in the National Assembly.\nMr Darmanin told news channel BFMTV the attacks were taking place in a climate in which France was \"on edge\" and more than 30 people had been arrested. \nHe said the attackers were either people who had \"spontaneously become angry\" or they were the \"ultra-left, ultra-right or other political groups\".\nImages filmed from a block of flats showed the youths swarming around the candidate, her deputy Virginie Lanlo and a party activist for President Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble alliance.\nMs Thevenot told Le Parisien website that when she and her colleagues objected to the youths defacing party posters \"they immediately attacked one of my activists, injuring Virginie\". Ms Lanlo suffered an arm injury, while the activist was punched and hit with a scooter, ending up with a broken jaw. The car windscreen was also smashed by the scooter.\nThree teenagers and a man aged 20 were arrested by police and the incident was quickly condemned across the political spectrum. \nMr Attal called on people to \"reject the climate of violence and hatred that's taking hold\", while RN leader Jordan Bardella said one of his \"big commitments as prime minister\" would be to \"combat record insecurity and repeat offending\".\nMr Darmanin has announced that 30,000 police will be deployed across France for Sunday's vote in an attempt to prevent \"the ultra-left or ultra-right\" from stirring up trouble. \nThe BBC spoke to voters in his constituency in northern France on Thursday who said they feared youths would go on the rampage whoever won, to express their anger at the political system.\nLaw and order is one of RN's big priorities, alongside immigration and tax cuts to target the cost-of-living crisis.\nRN candidates have also come under attack. Marie Dauchy described being \"violently assaulted\" as she campaigned at a market in La Rochette near Grenoble in the south-east. \nA conservative candidate allied with RN, Nicolas Conquer, complained that he and a female colleague had been pelted with eggs. And last month another RN candidate was treated in hospital after he was set upon while handing out pamphlets.\nHaving won 33.2% of the vote in the first round of the snap election, called out of the blue by President Macron, Mr Bardella's party is now aiming to win an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. \nBut his political opponents have agreed to do all they can to block the far right from winning enough seats to form a government.\nSeventy-six seats were won outright in the first round by candidates who won more than half the local vote in their constituency, including 39 RN candidates and their allies.\nThe other 501 seats will be settled in run-off votes, and 217 third-placed candidates have pulled out of the race to hand a rival a better chance of defeating RN. Of those 217 withdrawals, 130 candidates came from the left-wing New Popular Front and 81 from the Macron alliance.\nMarine Le Pen has complained bitterly about the operation to secure \"mass withdrawals\", and blamed those who sought to \"stay in power against the will of the people\".\nHowever, she said she thought there was still a chance of winning an absolute majority, if the electorate turned out in big numbers.\nThe latest Ifop poll suggests RN will win 210-240 seats, short of the 289 it needs to form a government. That is down on the 240-270 range of seats that it was estimated to win after the first round.\nNevertheless there is fear among some of France's minorities of what RN might do if it gets into power.\nIt aims to give French citizens \u201cnational preference\u201d over immigrants for jobs and housing and to abolish the right to automatic French citizenship for children of foreign parents, if those children have spent five years in France from the age of 11 to 18.\nDual citizens would also be barred from dozens of sensitive jobs.\nOne Muslim woman in a district that voted 54% for RN last Sunday told the BBC that RN was gaining ground with every election that took place.\nMeanwhile, prosecutors are investigating an extremist \"patriotic network\" ",

    "Great Western Air Ambulance may have to be grounded if the charity has to continue relying on reserves to pay a record \u00a3300,000 deficit, its chief executive.\nCEO of Great Western Air Ambulance Charity (GWAAC) Anna Perry said: \"We are asking people to support us so that we do have certainty for future years.\n\"You can cope with the deficit for a certain number of years but ultimately everybody has to make difficult decisions.\"\nGWAAC has forecast that it will see around 400 extra call-outs this year compared to 2023.\nOn average, that is an extra person every day who needs the specialist skills of GWAAC\u2019s critical care team. \nThe specialist crew responded to 1,159 people in urgent need of critical care between 1 January and the end of June - an increase of around 21% compared to the same period last year.\nMs Perry said the charity has been relying on reserves and in her seven years in charge she has never known such a bad financial situation. \n\"Ultimately the thing that saves an air ambulance charity money is stopping using the helicopter,\" she added. \n\"But we know local people don't want us to have make those decisions so we are confident that if people hear about the need of GWAAC, and our other neighbouring charities, then hopefully they will want to support us.\n\"You can cope with the deficit for a certain number of years but ultimately everybody has to make difficult decisions.\"\nAround six people a day across Gloucestershire, Bristol, Bath and beyond require their lifesaving services.\nAmong them people like Ann Carter who had a heart attack on 14 March 2024. \nThe 65-year-old from Stoke Orchard near Cheltenham went into cardiac arrest when at home alone and lost consciousness.\nMs Carter said: \"My daughter just got home and I said her name and then died. I was on the phone to the paramedic and they picked the phone up and said you must do CPR. \n\"I was trapped in the bathroom doorway so she ran outside, grabbed the local postman and between them they pulled me out and said 'sorry mum but you're a dead weight and between them they did CPR for quite along time.\"\nAn ambulance crew arrived and GWAAC specialist paramedic in critical care, Callum, was dispatched. \nHe arrived and gave Ann critical care before travelling with her to Gloucester Royal Hospital.\nAnn was in intensive care for three days following the incident and recovered in a cardiac unit.\nJust four weeks after her cardiac arrest Ann attended a CPR training day run by GWAAC where she met Callum and one of the ambulance crew who had attended to her on the day.\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s miraculous I\u2019m alive really. I was in a coma for three days, but now I am absolutely over it all and a whole new life, thanks to these wonderful people.\u201d\nThe Great Western Air Ambulance has seen an increase in call outs of more than 20% in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe charity has noted a significant increase in call-outs to babies, children and teenagers, both in percentage of total missions (19%) and in number. \nCall-outs to young people increased by 52% compared to the same period in 2023 and the crew responded to almost double the number of babies (from 26 to 50).\nResponses to calls for someone who collapsed or for a stabbing-related incident also increased. \nWhile call-outs to these types of incidents make up a small percentage of GWAAC\u2019s total missions, the number of these that GWAAC has been called to has increased. \nCalls to someone who has collapsed increased by 85% compared to 2023 (from 41 to 76) and a stabbing-related incident increased by 75% compared to the same period in 2023 (from 47 to 82).\nIn the first six months of 2024, the percentage of call-outs that GWAAC\u2019s crew responded to using one of their critical care cars increased by 7% when compared to the same period last year. The crew travelled to more than three-quarters of patients in a car rather than the helicopter.\nWiltshire Air Ambulance has also experienced its busiest start to a year ever, with a 25% increase in missions in the first half of 2024.\nThe Wiltshire service is not in financial difficulty. It is showing an increased level of usage.\nThe charity was tasked to 682 incidents between January and June, up from 543 for the same period in 2023.\nThis represents a rise of 25.6% in the need for the crew\u2019s critical care and expertise.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "More than 100 dog figures have been displayed by businesses as part of a project celebrating the heritage of disabled workers in Stoke-on-Trent's pottery industry. \nThe Pot Dogs, which have been made by people with disabilities, are being exhibited in Hanley's cultural quarter. There is also an illustrated trail map showing their locations. \nArtist Justin Edgar, of 104 projects, said it marked how disabled workers and children in the city helped create Staffordshire Dogs, which were mass-produced ornaments popular in the Victorian era. \nTwo 8ft tall model dogs will also be installed outside Hanley town hall later this month as part of the project. \nProject leaders said \"no aspirational middle-class Victorian home\" would have been complete without a set of the Staffordshire Dogs. \nOn production lines in The Potteries, disabled workers would paint the eyes, nose, mouths and gold chains of the dogs, they said. \nMr Edgar said for the project, ceramicist Alice Thatcher had collaborated with more than 100 people who used clay moulds from original Victorian dogs. \nLocal artist Chloe Breeze created the trail map where the small dogs can be spotted and ticked off. \n\"This is a fun way for audiences to discover and understand the heritage of Stoke-on-Trent\u2019s disabled workers and to celebrate disability and disabled artists,\" said Mr Edgar. \n\"No two dogs are the same and we\u2019re really proud of that celebration of individuality. \n\"We hope people will enjoy the dog trail as well as sample local businesses along the way\u201d. \nMr Edgar and Ms Thatcher were due to answer questions after a film about the project was screened at The Potteries Museum and Art Gallery on Saturday. \nPeople with disabilities across the city had also been involved in designing the 8ft dog statues, which the team hoped would be become a landmark in the city. \nThe scheme was funded by Creative Lives and the Arts Council. \nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A triple amputee has said he wants to show others with catastrophic injuries that anything is possible as he prepares to sail across the Pacific Ocean solo. \nFormer soldier Craig Wood, 33, lost both his legs and his left hand in Afghanistan in 2009 after being blown up by a roadside bomb. \nHe is planning to sail 6,000 nautical miles from Mexico to Japan to raise money for the charities which helped him recover. \nMr Wood, from Doncaster, said: \"I hope I can inspire other amputees to get into sailing - and change able-bodied people's perception of us.\" \nHis journey will take place on his houseboat, a 41ft aluminium catamaran called Sirius II. \nMr Wood normally lives on it with his fianc\u00e9e and two young children, three and one, travelling the world.\nHe said he has \"niceties\" such as a coffee machine, SodaStream and even a trampoline but the journey will still be \"by far the toughest thing\" he has ever done.\nMr Wood will be the first recognised para sailor to achieve this feat, according to World Sailing. \nHe plans to depart from La Paz in Mexico early in 2025, during a small window when the weather is favourable, and sail solo for roughly 80 days. \nThe only real contact, aside from Facetiming his family, will be with his UK-based meteorologist and a satellite communication system.\nWhen asked how he will spend his days, Mr Wood said: \"Tracking where I am, tracking again, more tracking, monitoring the weather and keeping logs. \n\"I'll also listen to a lot of audio books,\" he added. \nThe boat has certain adaptations for his disability, such as extra grab rails and an electric winch in case he injures his hand, but for the most part he will \"operate the boat as normal\". \nMr Wood said: \"My balance is absolutely affected by my disability, it's a lot easier for me to fall down.\n\"But I'm only falling two foot so I will just go on all fours or do an elephant crawl if need be.\"\nIf a storm hits, he has precautions in place including a huge parachute anchor to hold his boat in place. \n\"But if it flips, it will stay flipped,\" he said.\nMaking sure the weather is calm before he embarks is crucial.\nMr Wood was a keen windsurfer before he was injured and also learned to sail with his father during holidays in Bridlington. \nHe was told he would never windsurf again after the blast, but his father encouraged him to look into para sailing.\nDespite more than 20 operations, two collapsed lungs and losing 27 pints of blood, he was on speedboat in Weymouth within four months of leaving hospital in 2011.\n\"British Sailing taught me how sail with my disability, then it was just lots of time spent on the water - I did three weeks out of every four,\" Mr Wood said. \nMr Wood bought his first boat and embarked on his first voyage a few years later. \nHe is raising money for Turn to Starboard, a charity that helps injured veterans learn to sail. \nMr Wood, who is planning to marry his fianc\u00e9e Renata in August, said being on the water has been so healing for him.  \nMr Wood said that he used to feel trapped, but sailing opened up a \"new world of opportunity\". \nThe other charity which aided Mr Wood's rehabilitation is Blesma, who helps limbless veterans.\nThough the trip would mean being away from his family, he said he was determined to show other amputees \"what was possible\".\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

    "Tourists will be rewarded with free food and activities if they participate in environmentally friendly tasks while visiting Copenhagen, the city's tourist board has announced.\nThe trial scheme, which begins on 15 July, will see tourist attractions in the Danish capital offer rewards for activities such as litter-picking, travelling by public transport or biking around the city.\nUnder the initiative, visitors can claim free lunches, coffees, glasses of wine and kayak rental in return for their work.\nThe \"CopenPay\" scheme is designed to offset the \"environmental burden\" of tourism, according to the Copenhagen tourist board.\n\"When you travel abroad - if you fly to other places or you travel by car - you pollute,\" says the tourist board's communications chief Rikke Holm Petersen.\n\"One of the things we can change is getting people to act more sustainably at the destination.\"\nThe plan is only a \"little step towards the green transition\", Ms Petersen admits.\nThe project is \"trust-based\", meaning attractions are unlikely to ask for proof that the green activity has been completed. \"In some attractions you might have to show a picture of you riding a bike, or of your public transportation ticket,\" she says. \nThe government is not reimbursing the companies behind the attractions - including museums, rooftop bars and kayaking charities - for participating in the scheme. So far 24 organisations have signed up to the pilot.\nLast year, Copenhagen recorded over 12 million overnight stays, according to government statistics.\nMs Petersen anticipates a \"small percentage\" of visitors to the city will participate in the trial, which runs until 11 August. \nOthy Jasper, a 25-year-old Londoner who will be travelling to Copenhagen for work in August, said he is \"conscious\" of his air miles when he travels. \"It can really rack up - you have to think is it essential, is it worthwhile? Of everything one can do, catching flights is possibly the worst for pollution.\"\nSpeaking on the scheme, he says \"it's cool they're doing something for the climate\" but it would be unlikely he would spend time collecting litter in return for a reward.\n\"In terms of an incentive, it feels like a bit of an effort to do.\" \nIf the scheme is judged to be a success it will be rolled out across the rest of the year.\n\"Imagine if we could have people taking a greener mindset back with them - if that was the souvenir they got - that would be amazing,\" Ms Petersen says.

    "Rachel Reeves' favourite chess move is the Sicilian Defence.\nIt's an opening move designed to open up the board for later in the game - and one the chancellor used often as a junior chess champion. It's \u201cparticularly good when you want to go on the attack,\" she suggests.\nGrowing up, Reeves was driven around the country by her parents to compete and beat privately educated boys, often as the only state school-educated girl. \nThe story has echoes of the fictitious chess prodigy Beth Harmon - the lead character in Netflix show The Queen\u2019s Gambit, of which Reeves is a fan - playing out entire imaginary chess games on her bedroom ceiling, several moves ahead.\nAt No 11, Reeves is now applying the mathematics of constantly changing trade-offs to running the country\u2019s economy.\nAs she told me at her general election count, four hours after the exit poll had dropped, \u201cthere\u2019s not a huge amount of money there\u201d and therefore she was \u201cwilling to have a fight\u201d on ripping up red tape holding back the private sector from building new homes and rebuilding Britain\u2019s infrastructure.\nIn the 72 hours that followed, Treasury officials worked through the weekend to put together Labour\u2019s planning shake-up as part of a big bang announcement to communicate directly to business leaders.\nIt was designed to show total commitment to the growth agenda. Two green-belt data centres that had been blocked by local councils were given planning permission. Two house-building projects were unlocked, too.\nIn her first speech as chancellor, Reeves was stressing to investors that Labour was willing to use its landslide election majority to take politically controversial steps that would not have been possible under even a stable version of the previous government. \nThe presence of so many members of the cabinet at the speech was meant to signal an end to the years of soap opera, psychodrama and unstable personality politics.\nReeves wants the Treasury to be about more than tax and spend. It will be the \u201cgrowth department\u201d too, with the peer Spencer Livermore, now effectively her deputy for growth, alongside the Chief Secretary Darren Jones, who will focus on tax.\nWith her first announcements, she wants to convey an optimistic path for the UK that is attractive to investors. \nThose in the room for her first speech as chancellor seemed enthused enough. In private, top business people have told me that stability of strategy, policy and the ministers in charge would indeed represent a huge change. \nBut the proof will be in the new investments, the spades in the ground, and eventually the number of wind turbines and new houses.\nThe hope is to not just accept the difficult situation on borrowing, tax and spend, but to \u201cimprove the trade-offs\u201d, the chancellor says, again showing her chess thinking.\nThe more confident investors are in Labour\u2019s plans, the more money will pour in, and the more tangible improvements in the economy will be. \nThe  government\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has previously given credit to policies that it expects to boost the economy, for example factoring in former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s childcare policy into its growth forecasts. \nIf it does the same for Reeves' planning policies, there might be less pressure for spending cuts and tax rises.\nIn next week\u2019s King\u2019s Speech there will be new legislation enhancing the independence and role of the OBR, which Liz Truss infamously and disastrously sidelined at her mini-Budget.\nLater in the month, the chancellor will publish some details on the state of the public finances. This could help set early parameters for big tax and spending numbers in the autumn.  \nShe has already said she will be tough on adhering to rules designed to limit borrowing for day-to-day spending. \nCurrently, Reeves would need to make some very tough choices, potentially cutting spending on councils, prisons and courts and raising some taxes to do this.\nThis will come to a head in an autumn Budget and Spending Review.\nWhen pushed on whether she can really deliver a step-change to housebuilding, infrastructure and energy investment, while her government continues cuts to public investment planned by the Conservatives, Reeves is defiant.\n\u201cWe need the private sector to build homes, we are not going to be in the business of constructing homes ourselves,\u201d she replied,\nThe more the private sector steps up, the better these difficult trade-offs will get - with more money from outside, the less the government will have to make difficult decisions on spending cuts or tax rises.\nConversely, if the private sector is expected to do not just the heavy lifting but all the lifting on investment to power growth, it gives it strong leverage over policy.\nFor example, Labour says it will deliver 1.5 million new homes a year, but what will it do if housebuilders ask which construction workers will build such homes? \nHow will it answer the energy firms saying that regulator Ofgem needs to free u",

But, Mr Liddell-Grainger stood instead in the newly-former Tiverton and Minehead seat, which went to the Lib Dems.\nSpeaking to the BBC after his loss, he said: \"I hope I've helped in small ways where I can and I think the time has come to say gently say thank you very much.\n\"I'd like to thank my constituents for being their MP.\n\"I haven't got everything right and I acknowledge that and what I've got wrong is my fault and my fault alone.\"\nMr Liddell-Grainger added he was particularly proud of Hinkley Point C and the Gravity battery factory saying these were \"phenomenal achievements\" which the area \"richly deserved\".\nAround 11,000 people are currently working at the Hinkley Point C construction site in Somerset to build the new nuclear power station and Jaguar Land Rover-owner Tata says it will invest \u00a34bn in a brownfield site near Bridgwater to build its new battery factory. \nReflecting on his time in office, Mr Liddell-Grainger said he had \"no regrets\".\n\"I think with these enormously large seats, you need to spend more time there, I was trying to do too many things and I think it showed.\n\"I don't have regrets, I feel like I've done my best.\"\nHe added he had always known the Liberal Democrats could have a resurgence in the West Country and didn't blame Rishi Sunak for the Conservative losses. \n\"There is no point blaming anybody, we've created this over a long period with successive prime ministers and problems that we created,\" he said.\n\"You've got to be quite open about it, yes of course I'd like it to be a different outcome and a different sort of battle but here we are.\"\nMr Liddell-Grainger said Labour showed a coherent message which helped them.\n\"They worked very hard to be coherent and I think it showed. \n\"I wish Keir Starmer all the luck, he will find it difficult and like all prime ministers it will ultimately end in tears.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

We were very lucky.\" \nThe sequence of events leading to the baby's rescue began on Monday when the Calcasieu Parish Sherrifs Office received a call about a body being located in a pond near the Vinton Welcome Center.\n\"Our first priority was to get it out to the news media and get some leads,\" Mr Guillory said. \n\"And that's exactly what happened.\" \nOn Monday evening, the sheriff's office received a call from a grandmother who had seen the reports and was concerned about her grandchildren.\nShe told police the four-year-old had a younger brother, which caused police to issue a 'bolo' (be on the lookout) alert for the missing one-year-old and his mother.\nMs Jackson was arrested at a train station in Mississippi hours later.\nOn Tuesday morning, a marine division of the sheriff's office was boating through the pond where the brother had been found, searching for the missing boy. \nThey then received a call around 09:00 EST (14:00 BST) from a truck driver along Interstate-10 near the Texas-Louisiana border who said he had seen a baby \"crawling\" through a nearby ditch. \nMr Guillory said the investigation is ongoing and the cause of death for the four-year-old is currently unknown.

    "Stephen Hawking's personal letters and other documents have been catalogued and made available to the public.\nThe theoretical physicist died in 2018, aged 76, and his family donated the items to Cambridge University Library in 2021.\nTens of thousands of pages including scientific archives, photographs with public figures and scripts from television shows such as The Simpsons are included in the collection.\nThere is also correspondence demonstrating how Hawking was an active campaigner on issues including disability rights and nuclear disarmament.\nIn a letter to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, from 1978, Hawking wrote that there were \"no facilities at all for disabled people\".\nHe cited the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 and demanded better access to the building.\nIn a letter to his parents from 1986, which begins \"Dear mother and father\", Hawking dictates the text using his now famous communication system which he acquired after his tracheostomy the same year.\n\"I'm writing this letter on my new computer which also speaks but a bit like a Dalek with an American accent,\" he said in the letter.\n\"It is very useful for communicating but it is too big to carry around.\n\"However I have another one which I may be able to get fixed to my chair.\"\nHawking archivist Susan Gordon, who has spent the past 28 months cataloguing the collection, said the papers revealed how \"the same tenacity Hawking displayed in his professional career was applied to advocating for causes he believed in\".\nShe said: \"The archive will be a unique resource for researchers interested in Hawking's scientific work and academic life, his personal life, popular science communication, disability rights, assistive technology, and celebrity.\n\"I hope the release of the catalogue and the improved access it provides will allow others to be as rewarded as I was by interacting with the archive.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The European Union has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, as Brussels takes action to protect the bloc's motor industry.\nThe new tariffs on individual manufactures range from 17.4% to 37.6%, which is on top of a 10% duty that was already in place for all electric cars imported from China.\nThis could raise the price of EVs across the EU, making them less affordable for European consumers.\nThe move is also a major blow for Beijing, which is already in a trade war with Washington. The EU is the largest overseas market for China\u2019s EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy.\nEU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by \"unfair subsidisation\", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc.\nChina has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports.\nThe new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year.\nSo who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute?\nIt is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels.\nBy imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU\u2019s decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU.\nThe number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E).\nPatryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: \"I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46.\"\nT&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027.\nBut not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs.\nThey were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely.\nSAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4.\n\"The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,\" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm.\nFor Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: \"I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty.\"\nFor China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU. \nThat is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will \"give the automaker an advantage in the European market\".\nLu\u00eds Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car.\nBut, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because \"other brands would also be affected\".\nGeely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%.\nAccording to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will \"still export to the EU profitably\" but \"its profits will be significantly reduced.\"\nOther firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU.\nThose deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%.\nUS-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked  for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation.\nStill, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs. \nLast year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y.\nMr Koopmann",
    "It\u2019s late at night on the South Downs as a group of ardent wildlife spotters gather round a pair of glow-worms appearing to copulate. \nWhile the insect is declining in many parts of the UK, the healthy population of glow-worms at the Sussex beauty spot is drawing in spectators. \nWatched by a small crowd, the insects don\u2019t seem to be put off by the lack of privacy.\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to blush\u201d,  says Prof Alan Stewart, an ecologist at the University of Sussex, who is holding the tiny wriggling creatures in his palm. \nThe flightless female glow-worm uses a green light at the end of her abdomen - which glows due to a chemical reaction called bioluminescence - to attract a winged male suitor. \nSome people pay to witness this special sight during glow worms' breeding season in June and July. \nOthers attend free guided walks, like this one, which is organised by the Benfield Wildlife and Conservation Group near Hove.\nChristina came with her partner Matt after seeing the event advertised on social media. They had never seen a glow worm before.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing to be doing in the middle of the night but it\u2019s very cool to see them,\" she says.\nClive Bean is more of a glow-worm veteran and is known within the group as a skilled wildlife spotter. \n\u201cIf you get a lot of them it\u2019s like looking at a starry night but on the ground\u201d, he says.\nTonight, with the constant roar of traffic from the A27 in the background, the group find a handful of glowing females among the chalk grassland of the reserve and an abundance of males. \nProf Stewart is counting the population using simple traps fashioned from plastic drinks bottles that work like lobster pots. \nTo attract the males he uses green LEDs to imitate the glow of a real female.\nHe says he marks the insects with tiny dots of paint which doesn\u2019t harm them, before releasing them and seeing how many can be caught again one or two nights later.\n\u201cThat gives us a very accurate estimate of the population size,\u201d he says.\nSally Wadsworth, chair of Benfield Wildlife and Conversation Group, says the Benfield Hill nature reserve has a healthy population of glow worms.\n\u201cThey\u2019re really, really special and we want to look after them\u201d, she says.\nElsewhere, the insects are declining due to a host of factors, from habitat loss to light pollution. \nExperts believe artificial lighting is distracting the males so they miss out on a chance to mate.\nAs part of ongoing research, the University of Sussex students are carrying out field experiments on Mount Caburn near Lewes, to gauge the impact of light pollution. \n\u201cThey are a bit of a sentinel for what\u2019s going on in the countryside,\" says Prof Stewart.\n\"Because the females don\u2019t have wings, they\u2019re effectively sedentary so they\u2019re very much dependant on the conditions where they are. So if the conditions deteriorate or even if the habitat is destroyed then obviously they\u2019re in deep trouble.\u201d\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Local politicians have clashed over the cost of living crisis, healthcare and immigration in the BBC Radio Lancashire Your Voice, Your Vote Election Debate.\nAhead of the general election, representatives from the five main parties battled it out over the course of an hour.\nYou've been submitting your questions as part of the Your Voice, Your Vote campaign and we put some of those questions to candidates from across Lancashire representing Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and Reform UK.\nSo what did we learn?\nMaria Bennett from Preston works full time for the NHS. She says her income barely covers her bills and food. \nShe asked the panellists what they're going to do to help people who are struggling with the cost of living.\nReform UK's Dan Barker kicked off the debate by talking about his party's plan to raise the income tax threshold to \u00a320,000 \u2013 claiming it would save the average person around \u00a33,000 per year.\nLabour, on the other hand, ruled out increasing any of the main taxes. The party's Oliver Ryan pledged to invest in public services if Sir Keir Starmer became prime minister \u2013 saying the money would come from closing tax loopholes and \"changes\" to other taxes.\nJack Lenox from the Green Party said the country is going through an \"inequality crisis\" and said his party would help alleviate this by increasing the minimum wage to \u00a315 per hour.\nLib Dem John Potter said insulating homes would've helped to reduce energy costs and blamed Brexit for partially causing the crisis.\nConservative Sara Britcliffe said the government had regularly put financial support in place for people and cited the pandemic as the main cause of the crisis. \nWhen challenged on whether Liz Truss helped, she jokingly said \"no comment\".\nLisa Thwaite from Burnley said cuts to mental health services were at the forefront of her mind. She asked the panel what they would do to help people get better access to mental health support services.\nIn a rare moment, all five parties agreed that more needs to be done when it comes to mental health support.\nMr Lenox talked about his struggles with his mental health and said mental and physical health should be on a par.\nMr Potter said  prevention was better than the cure and said the Lib Dems would put a mental health practitioner in every school.\nMs Britcliffe \u2013 who also talked about her mental health issues \u2013 agreed and matched the pledge.\nWhile Mr Ryan added the NHS was \"on its knees\" \u2013 citing both funding and reform as the solutions, while Mr Barker said the NHS waiting list needed to be addressed.\nAndrew Smith from Lytham told the panel the issue he's most concerned about was climate change. \nHe feels that \"so little is being done\" and asked what the parties would do to tackle climate change and improve the environment.\nMs Britcliffe said the Conservatives wanted to tackle climate change in a \"practical way\" which \"doesn't hit voters in their pockets\".\nMr Lenox said there was so much low-hanging fruit when it came to tackling climate change. When questioned on the party's plans regarding the future of nuclear energy \u2013 which would impact the 1,500 people employed at Heysham nuclear power stations \u2013 he said the Greens were \"pragmatists\".\nBut Mr Barker disagreed: \"If you want to go for clean energy and you don't want nuclear, you cannot call that pragmatic.\"\nMr Potter pointed to his party's plans regarding tackling sewage in waterways \u2013 saying the current situation was \"just not right\".\nMr Ryan said his party was the only one which was realistically able to enact green policies \u2013 and said they would pay for them with a tax on oil and gas companies.\n\"One of the biggest problems today is illegal immigration,\" says Dave Wilton-Brown from Heysham. He asked the panel what they'd do to reduce it.\nMr Potter said the Liberal Democrats would introduce more safe routes for people to enter the country which \u2013 he claimed \u2013 would stop people arriving in small boats.\nMuch of the debate was taken up discussing the government's plan to send some asylum seekers 4,000 miles away to Rwanda.\nPoll tracker: How do the parties compare?\nVoting: Who can I vote for in the general election?\nGeneral election 2024: All BBC stories and analysis\nYour Voice, Your Vote: Tell us the issues that matter to you\nMr Ryan said Labour would deal with people smugglers as terrorists. \nHe said the Rwanda scheme was a \"complete waste of money\" and said they've sent more home secretaries to Rwanda than asylum seekers.\nMs Britcliffe disagreed, she said the Rwanda scheme was working \u2013 adding that people have been detained and are ready to get on flights.\nMr Barker said a hardline approach was needed adding that his party would return migrants to France. \nHe said: \"If we end up in a row with the French, that's not a bad thing if it ends up sorting the problem out.\"\nWhile Mr Lenox said one solution would be for the UK to have an asylum processing centre in France to deal with applications.\nHousing was last on th",
    "A woman who cared for her mother for nearly nine years has called on politicians to fix England's social care system.\nSue Marshall, from Worcestershire, said her long fight to secure nursing care for her mother Margaret had taken an emotional and financial toll.\nMrs Marshall is one of thousands of people who who got in touch with the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote to share their views ahead of the election.\nBBC Hereford & Worcester asked West Worcestershire's parliamentary candidates what they would do to reform the system. \n\"Healthcare isn't run by doctors anymore, it's run by managers,\" Sue Marshall said.\nAn only child and mother of three, Mrs Marshall cared for her mother Margaret Emmett after she was diagnosed with two brain tumours.\nBut following a serious fall in 2007 she required nursing care. \n\"The consultants were absolutely adamant that she had to have nursing care, because she was basically terminally ill... and that they should be paying continuing care for her.\n\"But when it came to it\u2026 no one would agree that she would have that. The council wouldn\u2019t, the [NHS] panels wouldn\u2019t.\n\"I was exhausted.\"\nAt the moment anyone with savings of at least \u00a323,250, or who owns their own property, is not entitled to help with the cost of care. \nBut continuing healthcare - funded by the NHS - can cover the cost for people with complex medical conditions.\nDespite repeated appeals, Mrs Marshall said her mother was only ever offered three months of funding at a time. Instead, the bulk of her care costs were met from her pension and the sale of her flat.\n\"I couldn\u2019t understand when, as a single parent, there wasn\u2019t any support coming for her in her old age when she was ill.\"\n\"We will often see the local authority and the NHS debating about who picks up the tab,\" said Simon Patient, managing director at Heritage Manor, a group of residential and nursing homes.\n\"It's a funding battle... and families are often caught in the middle.\"\n\"Really what we need is a more joined-up system, where adult social care and NHS interests are more closely aligned to the interests of Sue\u2019s mum.\"\nLast month, more than 50 organisations and 24,000 people signed an open letter calling on political parties to do more to support the social care sector.\nThe introduction of an \u00a386,000 lifetime cap on costs, set out by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, was postponed by two years in 2022, due to concern over staffing and financial pressures.\nBut Mr Patient said reducing the burden on families would only shift more financial pressure onto local authorities.\n\"They have been hugely constrained in their funding, which means they have not been able to meet the inflationary costs of care,\" he said.\n\"Unless \u2013 alongside this care cap \u2013 there is a massive funding injection, it\u2019s not going to be workable.\"\nSo, what would West Worcestershire's parliamentary candidates do to reform social care?\nConservative Harriett Baldwin said her party was committed to introducing a cap on the amount families would pay on care. This is due to start in October 2025.\nLabour candidate Kash Harron did not respond, but his party has confirmed it will not disrupt these plans. Labour has also pledged to form a National Care Service.\nLiberal Democrat Dan Boatright-Greene said more support was needed to ensure people could remain independent in their own homes. His party has pledged to introduce free personal care to older and disabled people at home.\nNatalie McVey, Green candidate, said an \"overhaul\" of the entire health and social care system was needed. The Greens have also promised to introduce free personal care.\nReform UK candidate Chris Edmondson declined to be interviewed. Reform has said it would cut income tax for all front line social care staff to zero for three years.\nParty of Women candidate Seonaid Barber said her party would get rid of the \"ideological capture\" that single sex spaces and services did not matter. \nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Harvey Weinstein is being investigated for \"additional violent sexual assaults\" months after a previous conviction in New York was overturned, a court in Manhattan has heard.\nNicole Blumberg, an assistant district attorney, told Tuesday's hearing that the alleged assaults fell within the statute of limitations, but did not say when prosecutors would be ready to press any fresh charges.\nThe disgraced film mogul, 72, is already facing a retrial after his 2020 conviction for sexual assault and rape was overturned in April on the basis that it was unfair.\n\"As we said in 2020, there were women who were not ready to proceed with the legal process. Some of those women are now ready to proceed,\" Ms Blumberg told Tuesday's hearing. \nWeinstein's lawyer Arthur Aidala told the hearing that the new investigations were a delay tactic, adding: \"Once again we have a hotline: 1-800 Get Harvey.\"\nMr Aidala added that his client was suffering from a host of medical problems while being held in solitary confinement at New York's Rikers Island jail.\nWeinstein was brought into court on Tuesday with his left hand cuffed to his wheelchair.\nWeinstein's 2020 conviction was crucial for the #MeToo movement, in which women accused hundreds of men in the media of sexual misconduct.\nThe Miramax film studio founder was sentenced to 23 years in prison for sexually assaulting production assistant Miriam Haley and raping actress Jessica Mann.\nHowever, the New York Court of Appeals in April found evidence presented about Weinstein's \"prior bad acts\" from three witnesses unconnected to the charges against him violated the right to a fair trial. \nMembers of the #MeToo movement described the decision as \"profoundly unjust\", while lawyers for his victims said the decision to retry was a \"leap backwards\" and \"tragic\".\nA retrial has been scheduled to begin after the Labour Day holiday on 2 September, although no specific date has been set. Ms Blumberg said on Tuesday  that prosecutors could realistically go to trial in November.\nWeinstein was also convicted  to 16 years following a separate rape trial in California. That conviction was not affected by the New York appeal court's decision, and he has not begun serving the California sentence.\nMore than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. He denies all charges against him. ",
    "Scientists say \"a reservoir of disease\" is being created after discovering bacteria that naturally occur in rivers are becoming resistant to antibiotics due to the impact of sewage.\nResearchers at the University of Suffolk said bacterial strains found on the non-tidal section of the River Deben in Suffolk had acquired resistance by exchanging DNA with antibiotic resistant E. coli.\nSome bacteria have become resistant to the antibiotic carbapenem, which is used as the last line of defence in fighting infections already resistant to traditional antibiotics.\nDr Nick Tucker, a microbiologist leading the research, described the discovery as \"particularly worrying\".\n\"Organisms that are currently low risk are being mixed with pathogenic organisms from sewage,\" he said.\n\"We're needlessly adding pathogenic and virulence genes to bacteria found in the environment, and that could be creating a reservoir of disease.\"\nThe team has been working closely with citizen scientists from the Deben Climate Centre, who have been taking water samples for two years.\nThey have also been working with scientists at the government's CEFAS laboratories, who have helped identify the new strains that are being screened for their resistance to six of the most commonly-used antibiotics.\nThe River Deben rises in Debenham, Suffolk, before flowing through Woodbridge and down to the North Sea.\nDavid Findley, one of the volunteers, said the bacteria came from multiple sources, including \"domestic cesspits, farms and some industrial waste\".\nFellow volunteer Bill Brammar said the water was often unsafe to swim in, adding \"a lot of these organisms are toxic and dangerous to human health\".\nThe discovery of bacteria from the genus Klebsiella, resistant to carbapenem antibiotics, was \"particularly worrying to us because carbapenem is reserved for treating our most difficult-to-treat infections\", said Dr Tucker, from the university's School of Allied Heath Sciences.\n\"The risk of infection doesn't necessarily change, but the ability to treat those infections is vastly diminished and it's something, as a society, that we shouldn't be doing. We should be avoiding that at all costs.\n\"It increases the risk of water users contracting an infection that is difficult to treat.\"\nBacteria can exchange plasmid DNA through a process known as horizontal genome transfer. \nThe university's team has isolated and analysed 500 strains of bacteria and found significant levels of antibiotic resistance.\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "\"Immediate and sustained action\" is needed by the European Parliament to ensure Irish is treated equally to other European languages.\nThat is according to the Irish MEP - and former president of the GAA - Se\u00e1n Kelly.\nHe claimed that Irish speakers in Northern Ireland, who hold Irish passports, can face problems in applying for jobs with the parliament.\nHe has also called for it to establish a link with Queen's University Belfast (QUB) in order to recruit more Irish-speaking staff.\nMr Kelly has written to the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, raising his concerns.\nIrish was recognised as an official language of the European Union (EU) in 2007.\nIt is one of 24 official languages in the EU, which means that speeches in the parliament and documents are translated to and from Irish.\nBut since then a shortage of translation staff has meant that the number of EU documents translated into Irish has been limited.\nA European Commission report in 2021 said that EU institutions employed 138 Irish speakers, although over half of the jobs were temporary.\nIt said that although Irish translation had increased, recruiting enough Irish speaking staff was \"the main challenge\" to providing full services in Irish.\nMr Kelly is a Fine Gael MEP and an Irish speaker.\nIn his letter to President Metsola he said that there were still \"significant gaps in the provision of Irish language services\" which needed \"urgent and comprehensive solutions\".\nHe said that there was still \"ambiguity\" over whether Irish speakers who live in Northern Ireland, and who hold Irish passports, were eligible to apply for translation jobs in the European Parliament.\nMr Kelly also called for the parliament to establish a Memorandum of Understanding with QUB to enable it to recruit more Irish interpreters and translators.\nHe said this \"could be instrumental in tapping into another significant pool of Irish language talent\".\nExperts from Queen's already authenticate bilingual translations for Belfast City Council, for example.\nThe EU currently supports a postgraduate course in interpreting at the University of Galway in the Republic of Ireland.\nAmong the other measures Mr Kelly has proposed are for school students in Irish-speaking areas to get better careers guidance on working in the European parliament and for \"targeted recruitment drives within Gaeltacht regions\".\nThe Gaeltacht describes parts of Ireland where Irish is the primary spoken language rather than English.\n\"The parliament's commitment to multilingualism mandates that all official languages be treated equally,\" Mr Kelly's letter concluded.\n\"It is imperative that we address the current shortfall in Irish interpretation and translation services with the urgency and dedication it deserves.\"\nBBC News NI has contacted President Metsola's press service for a response to Mr Kelly's letter.\nSeparately, new Irish and Ulster-Scots language laws for Northern Ireland were introduced in 2022.\nBut key elements of that change have not yet come into effect.\nAn Office of Identity and Cultural Expression has not yet been established.\nAn Irish language commissioner and a Commissioner \"for the Ulster-Scots and the Ulster-British tradition\" have not yet been recruited either.\nOn 10 June, the Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly told the assembly that recruitment for the posts was \"a lengthy process\".\n\"We are now waiting for more details around the legalities, the contracts, the proposals, the job specs and all those different requirements that we need to look at,\" she said.\nShe said that the Executive Office hoped \"to make an announcement in due course\" on recruiting eight staff in all for the Office and the commissioner posts.",

    "Oldham's Coliseum theatre, which closed amid an outcry in 2023 after more than 135 years, is to reopen after a successful campaign to save it, led by actor Julie Hesmondhalgh.\nThe historic venue, which has been boarded up since last April, will have a \u00a310m refurbishment in order to open its doors again in time for Christmas 2025.\nHesmondhalgh, known for roles in TV shows like Coronation Street and Mr Bates vs the Post Office, said she was \"absolutely over the moon\" at the decision.\nThe Coliseum was forced to close after Arts Council England withdrew its funding because of concerns over its management, while the local council said the building was \"no longer fit for purpose\".\nOldham Borough Council planned to replace it with a new, smaller \u00a324m theatre, but has now scrapped that idea in favour of refurbishing the existing building.\n\"It's been a battle, but it's been a battle of hearts and minds because Oldham people love this place,\" Hesmondhalgh told BBC News. \"They love it as a theatre but they love it also as a place that is owned by them.\"\nHesmondhalgh, who recently played the partner of real-life Post Office campaigner Alan Bates in the ITV drama, said she was \"in a little bit of a state of disbelief\" that the Coliseum campaign had worked.\nShe paid tribute to the local council for being \"willing to listen to the residents of its town and having the humility to change their minds\".\nHesmondhalgh and her husband, Coronation Street scriptwriter Ian Kershaw, were among 15 to 20 locals who have held fortnightly campaign meetings in a function room above an Italian restaurant around the corner from the theatre.\nA string of stars who have acted at the Coliseum in the past lent their support by appearing in a short film earlier this year - including Suranne Jones, Christopher Eccleston, Maxine Peake, Mina Anwar, Lisa Riley, Siobhan Finneran and Dame Sian Phillips.\nLongtime audience member Jane Barker, 58, was also part of the Save Oldham Coliseum campaign group.\n\"I've lived in Oldham all my life and I think the Coliseum is a really important place,\" she said.\n\"It brings visitors to the town. Oldham's had a really tough time. The town centre is struggling and we need our theatre back to bring bring visitors back into the town who will use the restaurants and bars before they come in to see a show.\n\"And the Coliseum itself has such a brilliant reputation for the quality of its productions.\"\nCouncil leader Arooj Shah said locals had \"an affection for this building that you can't ignore\", and that she \"wanted to listen to the people\".\nThe \u00a310m pledged for the refurbishment is much less than the \u00a324m earmarked for the new venue.\nHowever, the council said the two projects were different and their costs could not be compared, and Cllr Shah said the decision was not \"about money\".\n\"It's more about where people's emotions are and what they feel connected to, and I think you have to acknowledge that,\" she said.\nThe council had previously said the old building had numerous problems including asbestos, poor accessibility and cramped backstage and front-of-house facilities.\nHowever, concerns were raised that the proposed new venue would be much smaller than the old Coliseum and therefore less financially viable, and would not have the facilities to stage full-scale shows.\nThe Coliseum launched the careers of numerous actors over the years, including a string of Coronation Street stars; Bernard Cribbins, who joined at the age of 14 in 1943; and Doctor Who companion Millie Gibson and House of the Dragon's Olivia Cooke, who appeared there as members of Oldham Theatre Workshop.\nNew Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy described the venue as \"a shining example of the kind of cultural assets that local communities are so committed to protecting\".\n\"The decision by Oldham Council to invest in the refurbishment of Oldham Coliseum will ensure future generations can continue to be entertained and inspired at this iconic venue,\" she said.\nAn Arts Council England spokesperson said: \"At Arts Council England, our priority is to work with the people of Oldham to make sure that they have access to the art and theatre that they want - which is why we're investing \u00a31.845m over three years to support a creative and cultural programme in the borough, delivered by partners including Oldham Coliseum Theatre Limited and Oldham Theatre Workshop.\n\"While the Coliseum building belongs to Oldham Council and isn\u2019t funded by the Arts Council, we know what a well-loved landmark it is, and recognise its link to the strong history of theatre in the town, and the work the campaign group has been doing to preserve it.\"",

    "Former nurse Lucy Letby has been sentenced to another whole life term for trying to kill a premature baby girl.\nThe 34-year-old is already in jail for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder six others at the Countess of Chester Hospital between June 2015 and June 2016.\nOn Tuesday, she was found guilty of trying to murder another girl, known as Baby K, following a retrial.\nLetby had refused to go up to the dock to be sentenced to 14 whole life terms last August, but was in the dock earlier to be handed her 15th. \nHer original murder trial jury acquitted her of two counts of attempted murder, and there were six further charges on which jurors could not decide, including that concerning Baby K.\nEarlier this week, the retrial jury convicted her of trying to murder the \"very premature\" infant by dislodging her breathing tube in the early hours of 17 February 2016. \nBaby K\u2019s mother, who became pregnant with Baby K after a miscarriage, read a statement to the court in the presence of Letby.\nShe said: \"The devastation expands so far and for so long when a child is lost, let alone under these circumstances. \n\"Will we get answers and the verdict that we want? Will that actually bring some peace and closure? Baby K is not here, never will be.\n\"We will never have what would give us peace, closure, or a feeling of being complete family unit.\n\"However, you, Lucy Letby, will never hurt another child or have the privilege and joy that children give. \n\"Our time and effort that you have absorbed over the years will stop today and our focus will remain on our beautiful children and building the most exciting and love filled life that we possible can.\"\nJudge Mr Justice Goss KC told Letby: \"It was another shocking act of calculated, callous cruelty\". \nHe told her she had \"betrayed the trust of Baby K, her parents, and all those at the hospital\".\n\"You have coldly denied responsibility. You have shown no remorse. There are no mitigating factors,\" he added. \nAs Letby was taken down from the dock, she turned to the judge and said: \"I'm innocent.\"\nThe court heard how Letby, originally from Hereford, targeted the child after the baby\u2019s transfer from the delivery room to the neo-natal unit.\nAbout 90 minutes after her birth, Letby dislodged the breathing tube through which she was being ventilated with air and oxygen.\nThe jury agreed the former nurse then stood by her incubator as she watched her blood oxygen levels drop, without intervening.\nConsultant paediatrician Dr Ravi Jayaram had caught her \"virtually red-handed\" as he entered the unit's intensive care room at about 03:45.\nDr Jayaram, who intervened to resuscitate the child, told jurors he saw \"no evidence\" that Letby had done anything to help the deteriorating baby.\nHe said he heard no call for help from Letby or alarms as Baby K's blood oxygen levels suddenly dropped.\nBaby K was transferred to a specialist unit on 17 February because of her extreme prematurity and died there three days later.\nThe cause of death was certified as extreme prematurity and severe respiratory distress syndrome.\nLetby told the jury she had no recollection of any such event as described by Dr Jayaram and did not accept it had taken place.\nShe denied doing anything harmful to Baby K and insisted she had not committed any of the offences of which she had been convicted.\nDet Ch Insp Nicola Evans, from Cheshire Police, said the sentence \"once again reflects the true scale and gravity of her horrific crimes\".\n\u201cIt also highlights the torturous journey that Baby K\u2019s parents have had to endure at court \u2013 sitting and listening to extremely upsetting and distressing evidence about their newborn daughter \u2013 against constant denials from Letby. \n\"They have had to do this not once, but twice.\u201d\nPolice have said they are reviewing the cases of 4,000 admissions of babies into neonatal units at hospitals where Letby worked or trained, and are investigating whether the Countess of Chester Hospital should face criminal charges.\nDet Supt Simon Blackwell, from Cheshire Police, said an investigation into corporate manslaughter at the hospital, which was launched in October 2023, was considering areas including senior leadership and decision making between June 2015 and June 2016.\nHe said \"at this stage\" the force was not investigating any individuals in relation to gross negligence manslaughter.\nA public inquiry into how Letby was able to commit her crimes on the neo-natal unit is set to begin at Liverpool Town Hall on 10 September.\nLetby's legal team unsuccessfully brought a Court of Appeal challenge this April over her previous convictions.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "After every gig on Garbage's current tour, Shirley Manson says farewell to the city she's in - as she doesn't know if she'll ever play there again.\nThe frontwoman has been one of rock music's most dynamic performers for more than 30 years, but the Edinburgh native is aware of the passing of time.\n\"Life is so precious,\" she says, speaking from her band's latest stop in Barcelona. \n\"The older I get the more I enjoy life, I understand time is running out on me and it has allowed me to enjoy a sense of urgency, to harness it and put into my work. I don\u2019t know how much longer we can go on and do this. \n\"I\u2019m the youngest member of the band and I\u2019m turning 58 in a couple of weeks. So we are just enjoying every moment right now.\"\nThat does not means Garbage are riding off in the sunset just yet though. \nThe quartet - Shirley, Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker - intend to bring out a new album next year, and this Friday they will be one of the top acts at Glasgow's TRNSMT festival.\nA headline gig in Edinburgh follows on Sunday, and although Manson has lived in America for more than three decades, her Scottishness remains undimmed.\n\"My dad\u2019s still alive so I come back to Scotland a lot,\" she says. \"I\u2019ve still got a home in Edinburgh so I never feel like I\u2019ve left per se. \n\"I\u2019m in a no-win situation because in America I\u2019m not considered American, but when I come home to Scotland everyone says I\u2019ve left. I\u2019m a person of no fixed address.\n\"But I\u2019ve always believed Scotland to be my home.\"  \nLiving in America has been less comfortable for the singer in recent years.\nManson feels the country, and in particular the Republican party, is \"waging a war on women\", pointing to the overturning of the Roe v Wade abortion law.\nShe believes that attitude feeds down to the rest of society, including in the music business.\n\"In the 90s it felt like things were changing and there was a lot more opportunity for women,\" she said.\n\"There is still a lot of opportunity for women in the music business if you are willing to play the game. That means if you\u2019re pleasing, if you\u2019re sexy and you\u2019re willing to mind your mouth and your manners then you can flourish very well.\n\"But for any women that\u2019s an alternative - it\u2019s still very, very hard to be seen and supported, and that disappoints me.\"\nManson has never been one to mind her mouth, from her start with Edinburgh noise-makers Goodbye Mr MacKenzie through to alternative band Angelfish and then on to Garbage.\nFamously she was spotted by future bandmate Steve Marker when he saw an Angelfish video on TV, and thought she would be the perfect vocalist for the new rock band he was forming with fellow producers Vig and Erikson.\nSome critics may have sniffed at the band early on, dubbing them a \"studio project\" but acclaim and chart success followed. \nA barrage of hits came during the 90s and early 2000s, including Stupid Girl, I Think I'm Paranoid and James Bond theme The World Is Not Enough. \nThe 2021 album No Gods No Masters showed they had lost none of their fury, with a fast and chaotic assault on racism, sexism and capitalism.\nThe record also came when Manson was starting to suffer problems with her hip, due to injuries sustained when she fell off a stage in 2016 - a situation that led to a \"sobering\" hip replacement operation for her in 2023.\nYet despite her health situation and the \"turmoil\" in America, the group's next album will be \"more melodic and more loving\", according to Manson.\nShe says she would have \"lost her mind\" if only focusing on the current state of the world.     \nHowever as well as the future, the band have reflected on the past too - and the memories are not always pleasant.\nEarlier this year they issued a vinyl release of fourth album Bleed Like Me, which came out in 2005.\nThe making of that album proved so difficult the group went into hiatus for several years afterwards, after constant interference from their then-record label, Interscope.\n\"They were trying to mould us into a pop band,\" recalls Manson. \n\"There were a lot of bands willing to adopt a more pop approach, and it was just something that we decided we couldn\u2019t live with. We wanted to be who we were, for better and for worse.\"\nWhen the record label Interscope dropped the band, Manson felt the group was finished - having been told there was no room for the record company to promote more than one female rock band (they are alleged to have selected No Doubt instead). \nBut against those odds, Garbage have survived and thrived - something Manson hopes resonates with others, whatever their career.\nShe said: \"I was 40 at the time, and I was thinking \u2018no woman in alt rock has got out of this situation with her career intact'. I really believed my career was over. \n\"It has been a great surprise to me, and a delight, to dig myself out of that. I was very wrong about my career, as it turned out.

    "Rumours that an ancient oak tree in Nottinghamshire will die this winter have been dispelled by the RSPB. \nOn a social media post, there was speculation the Major Oak's roots have \"all but rotted away and won't be alive this winter\", which caused the RSPB to respond and quash the online myth.\nAs legend would have it, the tree in Sherwood Forest was used as a hideout by Robin Hood and has been fenced off since the 1970s to protect it.\nIn response to the rumours, the RSPB said: \"While all trees do eventually reach the end of their life, the Major Oak will still continue to live and be in leaf for many years to come.\"\nOn the condition of the tree's roots, the RSPB added: \"We are now working alongside some of the UK's leading tree and soil health experts to carefully aerate the soil around the tree's roots, increasing oxygen flow, as well as to add a mulch made from natural material in the forest.\"\nRob James, from the RSPB at Sherwood Forest, told BBC Radio Nottingham that the tree is still in leaf, meaning it is still alive. \n\"No-one can definitively say how long the tree is going to live, it is around 1,100 years old,\" said Mr James. \n\"There is a saying that oak trees spend 300 years growing, 300 years living and 300 years dying, so it has already exceeded that.\"\nMr James said the Major Oak had endured some challenges in recent years. \n\"It's a remarkable and resilient tree,\" he added. \n\"It's still in leaf at the end of the day. Despite it not looking as healthy as it has in the past, we are confident we can revive as much vitality as we can.\n\"The tree means so much to so many people and means so much to local people. It's symbolic to the county, but it also means so much to people all over the world as it is associated with the legend of Robin Hood.\"\nThe RSPB said despite the tree \"looking its age\", different methods had been used to make sure it stayed alive. \nMr James said: \"There has been frequent speculation about its health for many years, and it has certainly endured some challenges in recent times, including three consecutive droughts during peak growing periods combined with unprecedented high temperatures in July 2022.\n\"One of the biggest challenges it faces is the impact of soil compaction above its vast root system, caused by decades of visitors walking up to the tree. This has made it harder for rainwater to penetrate the soil and for essential microbial activity to take place below the surface.\n\"Vegetation around the base of the tree is being allowed to grow naturally to help break up the compacted earth and to retain moisture and vital nutrients.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian has been elected as Iran's new president, beating his hardline conservative rival Saeed Jalili. \nThe vote was declared in Dr Pezeshkian's favour after he secured 53.3% of the more than 30 million votes counted. Mr Jalili polled at 44.3%. \nThe run-off came after no candidate secured a majority in the first round of the election on 28 June, which saw a historically low voter turnout of 40%.\nThe election was called after Iran\u2019s previous president Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash in May, in which seven others also died.\nThe leaders of China, India and Russia have all congratulated Dr Pezeshkian on his victory.\nEven before the final results were declared by Iran's interior ministry, Dr Pezeshkian's supporters had taken to the streets in Tehran and a number of other cities to celebrate.\nVideos posted on social media showed mostly young people dancing and waving the signature green flag of his campaign, while passing cars sounded their horns. \nDr Pezeshkian, a 71-year-old heart surgeon and member of the Iranian parliament, is critical of Iran\u2019s notorious morality police and caused a stir after promising \u201cunity and cohesion\u201d, as well as an end to Iran's \u201cisolation\u201d from the world. \nHe has also called for \u201cconstructive negotiations\u201d with Western powers over a renewal of the faltering 2015 nuclear deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for an easing of Western sanctions.\nHis rival, Saeed Jalili, favours the status quo. The former nuclear negotiator enjoys strong support amongst Iran\u2019s most religious communities.\nMr Jalili is known for his hardline anti-Western stance and opposition to restoring the nuclear deal, which he says crossed Iran\u2019s \u201cred lines\".\nTurnout in the latest round of voting was 50% - higher than the first round last week, when the turnout was the lowest since the Islamic revolution in 1979.\nWidespread discontent meant that millions of people boycotted the elections. \nLack of choice in the candidates, dominated by Islamic hard liners, and the impossibility of real change as long as the supreme leader tightly controls policies added to their frustration.\nSome people who did not vote in the first round were persuaded to cast their ballot for Dr Pezeshkian this time round to prevent Mr Jalili from becoming the president. \nThey feared that if he won, Iran would be heading for more confrontation with the outside world and that he would bring Iran more sanctions and further isolation.\nIn order to stand, both candidates had to make it through a vetting process run by the Guardian Council, a body made up of 12 clerics and jurists that hold significant power in Iran. \nThat process saw 74 other candidates removed from the race, including several women.\nThe Guardian Council has previously been criticised by human rights groups for disqualifying candidates who are not loyal enough to the regime.\nAfter years of civil unrest - culminating in anti-regime protests that shook the country in 2022-23 - many young and middle-class Iranians deeply mistrust the establishment and have previously refused to vote.\nOn Iranian social media, the Persian hashtag \"traitorous minority\" went viral, urging people not to vote for either of the candidates and calling anyone who did a \"traitor\".\nBut Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected suggestions that the low turnout represents a rejection of his rule.\n\"There are reasons [behind the low turnout] and politicians and sociologists will examine them, but if anyone thinks that those who did not vote are against the establishment, they are plainly wrong,\" he said.\nIn a rare move, he acknowledged that some Iranians do not accept the current regime. \"We listen to them and we know what they are saying and it is not like they are hidden and not seen,\" Mr Khamenei said.",
    "How much is too much?\nThat's the question many in India are asking as the months-long wedding festivities for the youngest son of Asia's richest man enter their final phase.\nThe celebrations are expected to culminate this weekend when Anant Ambani, the youngest son of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, ties the knot with Radhika Merchant, daughter of pharma tycoons Viren and Shaila Merchant.  \nThere have been four months of lavish events leading up to the wedding itself. All the glamourous outfits, stunning jewellery, fairytale-like decor and rare performances by Indian and global stars have been the focus of much public attention.\n\"It is nothing short of a royal wedding,\" says writer and columnist Shobhaa De. \"Our billionaires are the new Indian maharajahs. Their shareholders expect nothing less than a mega extravaganza.\"\nIndians \"have always loved pomp and pageantry - just like the British\", she says, adding that \"the scale [of the wedding] is in keeping with the Ambani wealth\".\nBut the hullabaloo around the wedding has drawn as much ire as public fascination. Many have criticised the opulence and the sheer magnitude of wealth on display in a country where tens of millions live below the poverty line and where income inequality is extreme. \n\"[The wedding] can easily be seen as a kind of a mockery, a sort of blindness to the reality of the country at one level. At another level, however ridiculous this might be, it is still in keeping with the grossly distorted, almost grotesque bloating of Indian weddings in the last decade or so,\" writer and commentator Santosh Desai tells the BBC.\n\"It is part of a larger shift that is taking place. A generation or two ago, wealth was spoken of in whispers. Today, wealth must speak as loudly as possible. Even then, the scale of this wedding makes it an outlier.\" \nWith a sprawling business empire - ranging from oil, telecoms, chemicals, technology and fashion to food - the Ambanis are a ubiquitous presence in India and their lives are the subject of intense public fascination.\nMr Ambani's personal fortune is estimated at a staggering $115bn (\u00a390bn). Anant, 29, holds a position on the Reliance Industries board of directors.\nAmbani senior, along with fellow Indian business tycoon Gautam Adani, is reported to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, with opposition parties accusing the authorities of unduly favouring the two business houses - accusations both the government and the businessmen deny.\nWhile the Ambani family\u2019s enormous wealth and clout are well known in India, many outside the country may not have realised the extent of their riches until now.\nThat changed in March, when Mr Ambani hosted a three-day pre-wedding party for his son.\nThe festivities were held in the family's hometown Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, which is also the location of Mr Ambani's oil refinery - the largest in the world. Some 1,200 guests attended, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Bill Gates.\nThe party began with a dinner held inside a glasshouse especially built for the occasion. The stunning structure reportedly resembles Palm House, a crystalline Victorian-style building located in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, which was a favourite of Ms Merchant when she was a college student in New York City.\nThe feast was followed by a performance by Rihanna and viral videos showed the Ambani family grooving with the popstar on stage. If people hadn't been paying attention, they definitely were now.\nThrough it all, dozens of speciality chefs served some 2,000 dishes, carefully curated from around the world, to guests lodged in luxury tents, with personal makeup artists and stylists at their service. \nThere was also a 10-page manual on the dress code for the events, which included a \"jungle fever\" theme for a visit to a family-owned animal sanctuary, followed by a Moulin Rouge-themed \"house party\" held at the sprawling grounds of their palatial residence.\nThe bride-to-be wore a number of specially crafted outfits, including two lehngas (long bridal silk skirts) - one studded with 20,000 Swarovski crystals and another that reportedly took 5,700 hours to make - and a pink version of a Versace dress that actor Blake Lively wore to the 2022 Met Gala. \nThe groom mostly wore Dolce & Gabbana outfits and flaunted a Richard Mille wristwatch, worth an estimated $1.5m. A viral video of Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan gawking at the watch went viral in India.\nNewspapers and websites perfectly captured the opulence of these dazzling events, attended by the glitterati from around the world. \"It was almost like the time of maharajahs 100 years down the line,\" the New York Times reported.\nThere was also backlash after India's government overnight designated the city's small airport into an international airport, expanded its staff and deployed military and air force personnel in service of the family.\nThe final night of the three-day jamboree, which ended with a sh",

    "Numbers of one of Scotland\u2019s rarest plants have more than trebled on a hill in central Scotland following restoration work.\nSticky catchfly is a nationally rare species with fewer than 18 populations scattered across Britain. \nAround 10,000 flowering stems of the plant were counted by volunteers during a three-day survey on Dumyat in the Ochil Hills - an increase from 3,000 in 2013.\nThe Future Forrest Company (FFC) took over management of the Dumyat site in 2021 and has since embarked on a native woodland and nature restoration programme.\nThis included removing sheep and reducing numbers of roe deer around the crags. \nThe plant has a long-recorded history in Scotland and is said to have been admired by James VI on the crags of Arthur\u2019s Seat.\nIt can be identified by its pink flowers and sticky stem that prevents herbivorous insects such as aphids from climbing up it. \nHowever its numbers have declined and disappeared from many of its former locations due to overgrazing and gorse encroachment.\nThe latest count on the Ochil Hills represents at least 20% of the known British population.\nLindsay Mackinlay, head of ecology at the FFC, said: \u201cMany good people have worked over many years to try and conserve this gloriously beautiful plant at Dumyat. \n\"We were blown away by the willingness of so many people and organisations to help us count the number of plants up in the crags.\n\u201cWe are even more delighted that the plant appears to be doing really well since we have reduced the grazing up there.\"\nIt is hoped that the species will continue to expand across the Ochils, with other land managers helping to join up existing populations of the plant. \nNatureScot operations officer Stuart Bence, who surveyed the Dumyat plants in 2013, said: \u201cThese are absolutely amazing results. \n\"When we carried out the previous survey, we never thought we would see such high numbers and it is great news that the population seems to be spreading.\n\u201cTo see the species going from being on a knife-edge to recovering so well is fantastic and just goes to show the benefits that the changes to land management in the area have brought about.\"\nThe conservation work has also benefited the rare Northern Brown Argus butterfly, which was seen on Dumyat for the first time in 100 years in 2023. \nThe habitat changes for sticky catchfly also supported the common rockrose plant which the butterfly\u2019s caterpillars feed on.

    "Richard Chapman mends his nets in a gloomy Looe harbour and considers whether his new MP will bring Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's promised \"sunlight of hope\".\nSouth East Cornwall's long-standing Conservative MP Sheryll Murray has been ousted by Labour's Anna Gelderd - a constituency first. \nThe clouds break but Mr Chapman barely glances up from his task as he reflects on an industry he believes has been overlooked.\n\"I voted Conservative, it seemed the lesser of two evils. I've no clue what Labour's policy is on fishing but every government so far has been a let down,\" he says. \n\"You look around the port, it's dying,\" Mr Chapman adds. \n\"When I started from school there were 50 boats - crabbing netters, handline mackerel boats, trawlers. \n\"There are just six trawlers left.\n\"I liked to think my children, who are six and 10, would want to join the industry.

    "A man who stood for election to Parliament despite becoming homeless during his campaigning says he wants to help other people who fall on hard times.\nWesley Milligan stood in his hometown of Mansfield in Nottinghamshire as an independent candidate in this month's general election.\nThe seat was won back by Labour after seven years under the Conservatives, with Mr Milligan earning 335 votes and finishing seventh out of nine candidates despite his personal turmoil.\nThe 32-year-old said he was grateful for the support of friends and family.\nMr Milligan's electoral campaigning began before he became homeless, which he says happened about three months ago.\nWhen the election was called in May, Mr Milligan said he was moved to stand because he wanted to see change.\n\"I think that society, as well as our politics, is moving into a really concerning place, and I'm very concerned about my hometown [of] Mansfield,\" he said.\n\"You look around it and you can see it's really, really struggling.\n\"I come from a chaotic background, a difficult background, and I wanted to change things so that if I have children, it's a bit better for them.\"\nMr Milligan - who worked as a musical performer for 10 years - said he was in part-time work earlier this year to keep money coming in while he campaigned for election, but as he was due to start a new job his father died.\nHe said he soon fell behind on rent, and then ended up living in a tent.\n\"I couldn't start the new job emotionally, I ran out of money, got given my notice and I ended up homeless,\" he said. \n\"I think it's the kind of situation that you see quite a lot when you speak to the homeless community - it's just a sort of confluence of bad events.\"\nThough he had friends who offered a sofa at times, Mr Milligan said he was conscious of not being \"too much of a burden\" to others who had their own problems to deal with.\n\"I tend to take a night at a friend's, get a sort of refresh and then move on,\" he said.\nMr Milligan said it was difficult to adapt to homeless life initially, adding he had some possessions stolen when leaving his tent alone.\n\"Especially at first, you're very jumpy, you're very nervous about who's going to come along and take my stuff, or who's going to attack me,\" he said.\n\"A lot of the nerves come from worrying about members of the public coming along and maybe calling the police on you, or shouting something abusive towards you, which happens reasonably often.\"\nWhile living in a tent has its dangers and difficulties, Mr Milligan said there was a camaraderie and community spirit among homeless people.\n\"Amongst the homeless community, there's a huge amount of love and friendship and support,\" he said.\n\"There's still some chaos that goes on, because that's just part and parcel of the homeless life.\"\nMr Milligan also said the level of support and accommodation for homeless people was a major concern, with some choosing to sleep rough for their own safety.\n\"In terms of housing, in terms of finance, there's just nothing, but thankfully there are organisations [and] charities that can help you out with a meal, a shower, that kind of thing,\" he said.\nDespite his situation, Mr Milligan decided to carry on with his bid for election, with a donor helping to pay the deposit he needed to stand.\nHe said he did not approach the local council to register his homelessness as he was \"worried\" it could affect his candidacy, with only a few close friends aware of what was happening.\n\"I had this choice to make where I [could] either invest a lot of time and energy into trying to get a place, trying to get a job whilst the election is around the corner, or I can just accept my homelessness for a while and run the campaign,\" he said.\n\"I kept my homelessness quite quiet during the campaign - I've only been open about it recently.\n\"It definitely made things a lot harder, because what people don't understand is the chaos and the difficulty that you're dealing with [by] being a homeless person.\n\"Most of your energy and time is put into trying to stay dry, trying to stay warm, fed, clean, not getting your stuff stolen, all of that, and by the time you've managed to do all of that, you've very little time and energy to do other things.\"\nMr Milligan completed his campaign and made it to election night, with a charity helping him to find an outfit for the count itself.\nHe said the response from people when they learned what he had been through was heartening.\n\"The networks that I made when I was trying to build a political base advised me against telling people about my homelessness [while campaigning],\" he said.\n\"To be honest, now I wish I'd just come out with it, because it's nothing to be that ashamed of, and maybe it highlights some of the problems that we're facing at the moment.\"\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by hardship, debt or homelessness, the following organisations may be able to help.\nThough the election is over, Mr Milligan hopes to find a new job and a permane",

    "The Unite union has called off a strike planned for 8 July so that further talks can take place over the future of the UK\u2019s largest steel works at Port Talbot in Wales.\nOwners Tata had been planning to shut one blast furnace at the site in September and one this Thursday, but then threatened to shut both this week due to safety fears over a staff walkout.\nUnite\u2019s strike action was called to the dismay of other unions who feared that it would accelerate the closures and hasten job losses.\nThe Community and GMB unions had hoped that waiting until blast furnace four closed in September would give them time for more negotiations to extend its life, with a potentially new government in place.\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said the talks were \"essential\".\n\"Workers were simply not prepared to stand idly by while steel making ended and their communities were laid to waste,\" she said, saying the focus should be on fresh investment and the continuation of long-term steel making in the region.\nTata has been in talks with unions since January when it unveiled plans to radically transform its south Wales operations to deal with financial losses and to reduce its carbon emissions.\nWith government help, the steel giant plans to build a new electric arc furnace that recycles scrap metal and is less energy intensive - a move it says will secure the future of steel making at the site. \nHowever, it would need far fewer staff and require the closure of the two existing furnaces at Port Talbot, resulting in 2,800 job losses. \nExtending the life of one of them would save 2,000 of those jobs if the remaining blast furnace was left on until the new electric arc furnace has been built on the site, which could take up to three years.\nUnite, which had pulled out of the talks, was already taking industrial action such as banning overtime and was due to stage an all-out strike from next Monday. \nHowever, last week Tata threatened to close both furnaces within days unless it could \"safely and stably operate\" them during the strike.\nIt then wrote to all three unions, offering to begin new talks if the action was called off.\nOther unions have welcomed the news but have criticised Unite for giving Tata an excuse to shut the furnaces early. \nSources familiar with the situation accused the union of \u201cplaying a very dangerous game of brinkmanship with everyone's jobs\u201d. \nBut Unite officials rejected the claims, saying their action \u201chad helped focus minds\u201d.\nThey are also claiming a victory of sorts over the news that further talks will take place after the election. However, in a letter to unions from Tata - seen by the BBC - it is clear the company had already agreed to further talks after the upcoming election.\nAlun Davies, national officer for the Community union, said: \u201cThe truth is Tata never walked away from those discussions, and at our last meeting on 22 May all unions agreed to conclude the negotiations and put the outcome to our members.\"\nUnion officials acknowledge that there is no guarantee that Tata will agree to extending the life of one furnace beyond its scheduled shutdown in September.\nBut officials have expressed hope that if Labour wins the election, its manifesto commitment to invest \u00a32.5bn in the steel industry could help secure a lifeline.",
    "A man accused of murdering a father-of-two who was hit by a car while helping an injured woman in the street has told a court he had no intention of harming anyone.\nHassan Jhangur had armed himself with a knife when he turned up at a house in Sheffield on his sister Amaani Jhangur's wedding day. \nSheffield Crown Court heard that Mr Jhangur hit five people with his car during a brawl outside the property, with passer-by Chris Marrott, 46, killed instantly. \nMr Jhangur, 24, of Whiteways Road, Sheffield, denies Mr Marriott\u2019s murder or manslaughter.\nThe court previously heard that Mr Jhangur also denies charges of attempted murder and wounding with intent in relation to another victim.\nHe had admitted causing death by dangerous driving, and charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, but denies charges of grievous bodily harm.\nMeanwhile, Mr Jhangur's father, Mohammed Jhangur, 56, has denied a charge of perverting the course of justice.\nAmaani Jhangur had fallen out with her family about her wedding with Hasan Khan on 27 December 2023, the court heard, with her relatives not attending the ceremony.\nHer mother Ambreen Jhangur and sister Nafeesa Jhangur later turned up at the Khans' house, the jury was told, and started throwing items onto the driveway. \nAn argument between the women and the Khan family led to Nafeesa Jhangur falling to the floor, with Mr Marriott stopping to help. \nProsecutors said Mr Jhangur had first hit Hasan Khan's father, Riasat Khan, who was sent \"cartwheeling\" over the bonnet, before \"driving right over\" Mr Marriott and Nafeesa Jhangur.\nHe also collided with his mother Ambreen Jhangur and Alison Norris, a passing off-duty midwife.\nGiving evidence on Tuesday, Mr Jhangur said the family had concerns about Hasan Khan's behaviour with Amaani Jhangur.\nThey claimed he had been \"abusive\" about the other Jhangur sisters during a phone call leading up to the wedding, with the defendant calling Hasan Khan to \"confront him\".\nHe told jurors: \"I was angry, I was upset because the words he used were very inappropriate.\n\"I told him to back off because it started to get out of hand with him controlling Amaani and using sexual slurs towards my other sisters.\"\nMr Jhangur said on the afternoon of the wedding day he was woken up to his family members shouting \"they've hit Nafeesa\".\nHe told the court: \"I panicked, I'm shocked, I'm concerned for my sister's safety. \n\"I thought I'll need to protect her.\"\nMr Jhangur said he got dressed and took a knife to the scene, telling jurors he took the weapon because he thought there would be other male relatives of Mr Khan  there.\n\"I had a gut feeling that if males are involved I'm going to be outmanned,\" he told jurors.\n\"My mind was just blank, I was just focusing on getting to the scene.\"\nAsked if he intended to kill or cause serious harm to anybody, Mr Jhangur replied: \"Not at all.\"\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "China has said it seized a Taiwanese boat, which had five crew members on board, for illegally fishing in its territorial waters on Tuesday night. \nTaiwan has asked China to release the vessel - and the men, two Taiwanese and three Indonesians - which is being held at Weitou, a port in the south-east.  \nTaiwanese officials have confirmed to the BBC that the boat was seized inside China\u2019s territorial waters, about 2.8 nautical miles (5.1km) off its coast. It was also operating during China's annual summer-time fishing ban from May to August. \n\"The fishing vessel violated the fishing moratorium regulations and trawled illegally within the... prohibited area,\" Liu Dejun, spokesperson of the China Coast Guard, said. \nHe also accused it of using the wrong fishing gear and \"damaging marine fishery resources\". Taiwan is yet to respond to these comments. \nSuch altercations have become common in the contested 110-mile strait that separates China and Taiwan. \nChina claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own and the strait as its exclusive economic zone, although other countries that navigate these waters, such as Japan and the United States, do not recongise this. And the Chinese military has ramped up pressure on Taiwan in recent years. \nChinese authrities have seized and detained 17 Taiwan-registered vessels since 2003 for fishing during the summer-time ban, Taipei's data shows. Taiwan too has detained five such boats from China this year alone. \nTaiwanese authorities say they were alerted at 20:04 local time (12:04 GMT) on Tuesday by the captain that officers from two Chinese coast guard vessels had boarded and seized the fishing boat.\nThere was a brief but tense standoff as three Taiwanese coast guard ships were dispatched to rescue the boat. But they said they did not pursue them because there were four other Chinese coast guard ships approaching and they did not want to escalate tensions.\nChina's coast guard says the Taiwanese used loudspeakers to demand the release of the fishing boat - and the Chinese did the same, asking the other side not to interfere. \n\"There were 40 to 50 fishing boats out at sea at the time. I don\u2019t know why he targeted my boat,\" the owner of the fishing vessel told local media. \"This never happened before - in the past they would just chase you away if you got too close.\u201d\n\nBeijing and Taipei used to be more flexible about each other's fishing fleets, especially around Taiwan\u2019s off-shore islands, which lie extremely close to the Chinese coast.\nBut in recent years Taiwan has been enforcing its own waters more strictly - a response to what it says is a massive increase in poaching by fishermen from China's coastal Fujian province. \nIn February, two Chinese fishermen drowned after their boat overturned while trying to outrun a Taiwanese coast guard boat. Since then, China\u2019s coast guard has turned more assertive in patrolling around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands.\nChina has also become increasingly aggressive in enforcing what it sees as its maritime claims across the region. Its coast guard has become the most visbile arm of Beijing's vast naval operation.\nIts dispute with the Philipines over a number of reefs in the South China Sea has caught the most attention and has raised Washington's concerns.\nBut the Chinese coast guard has also stepped up its actions around a Japanese-controlled group of islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu. \nLast month Chinese coast guard ships took the unprecedented step of driving away Japanese fishing boats close to the islets. It led to a brief stand-off between Chinese and Japanese coast guard ships.\nThis more assertive Chinese behaviour also comes just weeks after Beijing implemented new maritime regulations that give it\u2019s coast guard personnel wide powers to board, search and detain vessels inside all waters China claims. \nUnder the new regulations, foreign nationals who are considered to have violated \u201cexit and entry rules\u201d can be detained without charge for up to 60 days.\nThe new regulations were thought to have been aimed mostly at deterring Filipino fishermen from entering disputed reefs in the South China Sea. \nBut maritime scholars have been quick to point out that China has expansive, poorly- defined claims across thousands of square kilometers of sea that are disputed by all of its neighbors from South Korea to Indonesia.",
    "After weeks of canvassing and debating, the people of East and West Sussex have voted.\nAcross 17 constituencies, voters have gone to the polls in the general election, which has seen the Labour Party claim a landslide victory.\nWhile it was a good night for Labour which gained four seats, it was an even better night for the Liberal Democrats who gained five \u2013 all from the Conservative Party.\nSo what did we learn? Here are five takeaways from the results, with all the results available in our live page here.\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan lost her seat in Chichester to the Lib Dems.\nShe will be replaced by Jess Brown-Fuller, who won with a majority of 12,146.\nThe Lib Dems called the result early, issuing a statement before 02:00 BST saying \u201cschool\u2019s out\u201d for Keegan \u201cfor summer, autumn, winter and spring\u201d.\nMs Keegan, who was forced to apologise for her language after being caught swearing on microphone as she expressed irritation over the concrete crisis, had been an MP since 2017.\nThe Liberal Democrats also won in Lewes, a notional gain from the Conservatives due to boundary changes.\nJames MacCleary won with 26,895 votes (50.58%), while Maria Caulfield, the former health minister and minister for women, received 14,271 votes (26.84%).\n\"I'm really excited to have been elected today, we have a fantastic list of things to get to work on,\u201d Mr MacCleary told BBC Radio Sussex.\nThe Lib Dems have secured the seat for the first time since Norman Baker, who was the MP between 1997 and 2015.\nDespite the departure of long-standing MP Caroline Lucas, the Green Party has held onto Brighton Pavilion.\nOnce a traditional Conservative seaside city, Labour won the seat in a by-election in 1995, before Ms Lucas became the first Green MP at Westminster in 2010.\nMs Lucas held the seat for 14 years before stepping down at this election.\nSian Berry, the former leader of the party, won with 28,809 votes (55%). Her closest rival was Labour's Tom Gray, who took 14,519 votes (27.7%).\nThe leader of Worthing Borough Council, Labour\u2019s Dr Beccy Cooper, has unseated Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley in Worthing West.\nSir Peter had been the MP since the constituency's creation in 1997 and was the Father of the House of Commons.\nLabour won the seat of Worthing West, a notional gain from the Conservatives due to boundary changes, by 3,949 votes.\nDespite heavy losses across East and West Sussex, it was not all doom and gloom for the Conservatives.\nThe Tories notionally held on to the new constituency of East Grinstead and Uckfield, with Mims Davies taking 19,319 votes (38.3%).\nKieran Mullan was elected as MP for Bexhill and Battle - albeit with a reduced majority, while the Conservatives held onto Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which was previously held by former minister Nick Gibb from 1997, who stepped down at the election.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Ticketmaster customers in North America have been sent emails warning them to take action after the company was hacked in May.\nEmails were sent overnight to Canadian customers, urging them to \u201cbe vigilant and take steps to protect against identity theft and fraud.\"\nThe company has not commented on the notification process - however similar emails have reportedly been sent to victims in the US and Mexico.\nThe personal details of 560 million Ticketmaster customers worldwide were stolen in the hack - with cyber criminals then attempting to sell that information online.\nTicketmaster has not responded to the BBC asking it why it has taken so long to warn customers of the risks they face.\nPrevious news of the breach came from the hackers themselves, followed by a notice from Ticketmaster to its shareholders.\nTicketmaster confirmed that hackers had stolen names and basic contact details, without specifying which types of information had been obtained.\nHackers also stole encrypted credit card details, but the company has not responded to a BBC request for more information on how secure that encryption is. \nAccording to the email seen by the BBC, the firm is urging customers to monitor their online accounts, including bank account statements, for any suspicious activity.\nThe company advises Canadian customers to sign up for identity monitoring services, which Ticketmaster is paying for.\n\u201cIdentity monitoring will look out for your personal data on the dark web and provide you with alerts for 1 year from the date of enrolment if your personally identifiable information is found online,\u201d the company said.\nTicketmaster suggests people watch out for any suspicious-looking emails that look like they are from the company.\nWhen a data breach happens it can sometimes lead to secondary hacking or fraud attempts by other criminals who use your details to trick you into sending them money or downloading malicious software. \nHowever, that is rare and there is little evidence that this happens at scale.\nThe group responsible for the Ticketmaster hack is called ShinyHunters - it posted an advert on a hacking forum on 28th May offering the data of 560m customers.\nThe gang is asking for $500,000 (\u00a3390,000) for the data and it is not clear if they have sold the tranche.\nAfter days of investigation, it was revealed that the hackers had taken data from Ticketmaster by stealing login details from Snowflake, the company it uses for its cloud storage account.\nIt then emerged that more 160 other Snowflake clients had been targeted in the same way - with huge amounts of private and corporate data being stolen.\nBanking group Santander is one of those affected - 30m of its customers in Chile, Spain and Uruguay were hacked.\nCyber security firm Mandiant - which investigated the attacks - says Snowflake itself was not breached.\nMandiant says ShinyHunters, or whichever hackers carried out the wider attacks, obtained the login details from each client company directly.\nTicketmaster\u2019s owner Live Nation has previously only confirmed the hack via a notice to shareholders filed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIt acknowledged \"unauthorised activity\" on its database but said the hack would have no material impact on its business.\nTicketmaster did not respond to multiple requests for comment from journalists before and since the filing.",

    "A nun jailed for abusing vulnerable youngsters at an orphanage has had her prison term cut following an appeal.\nSister Sarah McDermott was given a three-year sentence for mistreating children at Smyllum Park between 1969 and 1981 following a six-week trial at Airdrie Sheriff Court in January.\nHer co-accused, Sister Eileen Igoe, 79, and carer Margaret Hughes, 77, succeeded in their bid to have their sentences cut in May due to \u201cinsufficient\u201d weight being given to their age.\nJudges at the Court of Appeal agreed to cut McDermott\u2019s sentence to seven months for the same reasons.\nLady Dorrian, Lord Mattews and Lord Docherty argued that the trio \u201cpresent no future risk to the public,\u201d describing the conviction as \u201cpunitive\u201d.\nSmyllum Park, in Lanark, has been at the centre of allegations of historical abuse.\nDuring sentencing at Airdrie Sheriff Court, Sheriff Scott Pattison said there was no alternative to prison for the three women.\nThe sheriff said the \"lasting harm\" and \"serious nature\" of the offences meant only custodial sentences were appropriate.\nThe trial heard from one witness, who said she was beaten by McDermott, having witnessed her brother being sexually abused in a toilet cubicle.\nMcDermott, from London, slapped the girl and told her she was bringing \u201cfilthy home habits into a good Catholic place\u201d.\nVolunteer worker Brian Dailey was later jailed for 15 years for abusing children.\nOn another occasion, McDermott struck another girl with rosary beads and hit her on the head and body.\nMeanwhile, Igoe, from Edinburgh, force fed children and made one eat their own vomit as well as striking one boy on the head and body.\nHughes, from Lanark, seized one boy by the hair before striking him with her arm.

    "Many of Monday's front pages focus on what Rachel Reeves is expected to say in her first speech as chancellor. \nThe Daily Mail says she will \"declare war on Britain's planning system\". \nThe Daily Telegraph says Labour's promise to bring back mandatory housebuilding targets will raise fears the party will \"push councils to build on green belt land\". \nThe Times has a similar assessment on its front page, with the headline: \"Homes on green belt in new dash for growth\". \nThe Financial Times says shares in house-building companies rose after Labour's election win, in anticipation of bold action from the new government.\nThe i newspaper believes Labour is heading for a new \"Brexit clash\" with the EU over migration. A German diplomatic source tells the paper that easier mobility for young people is a key priority for the bloc. \nHowever, the article says Labour has ruled out free movement, and that the \"party is reluctant to increase youth migration\". \nSeparate analysis by the Times says \"increasing mobility could take the new government into some difficult areas\". \nThe paper says that while the bloc would welcome Britain back into the Erasmus student exchange scheme, the \u00a3135m a year cost was seen by the previous Conservative government as \"prohibitively high\".\nThe Telegraph says freeing prisoners who have served as little as 40% of their sentence is among the options being considered by Labour to address overcrowding in jails. \nA prison service source is quoted by the paper as saying the proposal \"feels like the only measure that buys time\" with reports prisons could run out of spaces within weeks. \nThe article does not carry a direct response from ministers, but says no final decision has been taken and the matter will have to be agreed by the Cabinet.\nThe Daily Express uses its front page to lay out its own priorities for the new government.

    "The leader of France's Socialist party, Olivier Faure, has thrown his hat in the ring to be prime minister, after the left-wing alliance to which he belongs won Sunday's parliamentary election.\nHe said he was \"ready to assume this function\", but only as part of \"the dialogue with our partners\".\nThe leftist New Popular Front, which also includes Socialists, Greens and Communists, were the surprise winners on Sunday, but they have nowhere near enough seats to form a credible government by themselves.\nVictorious MPs from the left-wing alliance arrived in parliament on Tuesday and called on President Emmanuel Macron to nominate a prime minister from their party.\nUnder French convention, the president names a prime minister from the winning party. However, Sunday's election has left the country in political deadlock, with no obvious route to a government.\nThe Popular Front won 182 seats, but the Macron alliance was not far behind with 168, while the far-right National Rally have 143, despite being favourites to win.\nWith three powerful blocs in French politics, none can form an outright majority of 289 in the 577-seat parliament without reaching out to either of the other two. \nWithout enough support to survive a \"censure\" vote of no confidence, there is little chance of any of a left-wing government surviving for long on its own.\nThere has been some concern among centrists inside the Macron alliance that the president has made no public comment since the election result. He is due to fly to Washington on Wednesday morning for a Nato summit, leaving the political deadlock behind.\nThe Macron camp, as much as the left, believes it can find a way of forming a minority government.\nInstead of naming a new prime minister, the president asked outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to remain in office \"for the time being\" to ensure the stability of France. Mr Attal had gone to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to hand in his resignation after  Sunday's election defeat, but the president rejected it.\nThe Socialist leader's decision to put his name forward on Tuesday indicated tensions among the parties of the Popular Front, who had met the night before in a bid to agree a candidate for prime minister.\nThe veteran leader of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI), Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, said his party had \"no shortage of talent\" and proceeded to name party leader Manuel Bompard and two colleagues Mathilde Panot and Cl\u00e9mence Guett\u00e9 as potential candidates.\nOthers have suggested the leader of the Greens, Marine Tondelier, as a potential prime minister.\nMathilde Panot was among the LFI MPs who arrived at the National Assembly on Tuesday and did not refer to herself as a potential candidate.\nHowever, she did call for the current caretaker prime minister, Gabriel Attal, to go.\n\"We demand that Emmanuel Macron respect the popular vote by choosing to name a prime minister who comes from the New Popular Front,\" Ms Panot announced outside the National Assembly.\n\nWith France's national Bastille Day five days away, Ms Panot said it was \"impossible that we can continue with a prime minister who has been beaten three times in a row in elections\".\nBut there is friction within her party as well and one MP who was purged from Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's party, Cl\u00e9mentine Autain, said she was prepared to take on the post of prime minister if it were given to her.\n\nShe is one of several ex-LFI MPs thrown out of the party who are setting up their own group, and they have urged Communists and Greens to join them. Ms Autain warned her former colleagues to reflect carefully that the M\u00e9lenchon purge could easily happen to others.\nMembers of the Ensemble alliance also met on Monday night to decide their next course of action after Sunday's extraordinary result.\nAn indication of their intentions came from centrist MP Sylvain Maillard, who told French TV they would try to form a minority government with other mainstream parties.\nHe said they would reach out to the \"republican arc\" that could run France for the next three years, when France is due to hold its next presidential and parliamentary elections.\nNeither the far right nor LFI are seen as part of the France's republican mainstream, and LFI are understandably hostile to any attempt to form a government in which they play no part.",
    "The island of Ireland is now much more likely to experience heatwaves and record-high temperatures of 33C, according to research from Maynooth University in County Kildare.\nThe study, led by Professor Andrew Parnell of the Hamilton Institute, suggests that what was once a one-in-180 year event has now become a one-in-nine year event. \nScientists investigated the frequency and increases in extreme temperatures in Ireland - north and south - from 1931 to 2022.\nThe significant increase in the likelihood of extreme heatwaves underscores the need for the island to prepare for rising temperatures and their potential impacts.\nIt means the likelihood of temperatures climbing so high is about 20 times more in recent years than 80 years ago.\n\"We took data from across Ireland, both north and south, and we used mathematical methods and computational models to produce the results,\" Prof Parnell told BBC News.\n\"I was expecting a change in how often we could see such extremes, but we were not expecting the changes to be this large in just 80 years.\"\nThis dramatic shift means temperatures of 33C, which last occurred over 80 years ago, are now much more probable.\nTwo years ago, the Phoenix Park weather station in Dublin recorded a temperature of 32C, the highest ever for the region and just below Ireland\u2019s all-time record of 33.3C.\nThe highest temperature recorded in Northern Ireland was 31.3C in Castlederg in July 2021.\nIn Northern Ireland, a heatwave is reached when temperatures climb above 25C for at least three consecutive days.\nThe research team focused on how frequently such extreme temperatures might recur and the extent of their geographic impact.\nProf Parnell emphasised that extreme heat events now cover twice the area they did 80 years ago, affecting many more people.\n\"We are not only seeing these extreme events occurring at a single weather station dotted around the island, they are now spreading to other locations,\" he said.\nHe also warned that Ireland could see temperatures of 34C within the next three to five years, a temperature that has never been recorded on the island.\nThe likelihood of hitting 34C has increased from a one-in-1,600 year event to a one-in-28 year event, according to the research.\n\"The main message is to not let this fall off the political agenda,\" Prof Parnell added.\n\"Extreme heat like this affects things such as the health service with increased heat related admissions, as well as disruption to agriculture because of large droughts.\n\"We need to prepare for these events.\n\"It's almost like planning for a pandemic - we don't know exactly when they will happen, but the likelihood is that they will.\"\nThis research shifts the focus from average temperature changes to the frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures, highlighting an area of concern for climate science and policy.",
    "The support received by convicted baby murderer Lucy Letby has been \"rather surprising\", according to the chief prosecution witness in her trial. \nDr Dewi Evans said some of Letby's supporters had refused to believe the evidence against her and had reported him to the General Medical Council (GMC).\nLast week, Letby was sentenced to a 15th whole-life term for trying to kill a premature baby girl.\nThe 34-year-old had already been jailed for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder six others at the Countess of Chester Hospital in 2015 and 2016.\nDr Evans, a retired paediatrician from Carmarthen who was the lead medical expert in the case, said he was shocked but not too surprised to hear about the complaints against him.\nHe told Radio 4's Today programme that \"back in the day\" it was \"not uncommon\" for supporters of abusers to intimidate doctors by complaining to the GMC.\n\"This occurred quite a lot in the '80s and '90s, but to occur now is rather surprising,\" he said. \nSome of those that believe Letby is innocent have targeted Dr Evans online. \nHowever, he said he has avoided social media and had CCTV installed at his home following another child abuse case a few years ago. \n\"It\u2019s such a shocking thing to come to terms with and of course one of the ways of dealing with shocking news is to go into denial and shoot the messenger,\" he said.\n\"This is what\u2019s happened in this particular case.\"\nHe said it was \"very, very difficult\" to come to terms with the fact these murders were \"not caused by an old individual\" but by a \"young, white, English nurse from a respectable background\".\n\"How on earth can you stomach that? And one of the ways of dealing with it is to deny that it happened.\"\nDr Evans added he believed Letby got away with her crimes, aside from the \"incompetence of general managers\", because she \"hid in plain sight\". \n\"She superficially appeared as a fairly normal person, and this is essential for anyone who commits a crime hiding in plain sight.\n\"It happened with Harold Shipman, it happened with Jimmy Savile, it is crucial to their getting away with it that they appear normal.\"",
    "A woman with terminal ovarian cancer has described how \"uncomfortable\" she was after being told to sleep on a hospital floor, saying it was \"not where anybody should be\". \nMadeleine Butcher has visited Blackpool Victoria Hospital seven times over the past year to be treated for sepsis, linked to her condition.\nOn the most recent visit, in late June, she was told she could be waiting up to 36 hours to be admitted and no trolley or comfortable chair was available.\nBlackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust apologised and said it was conducting a \"thorough investigation\".\nMrs Butcher, from Poulton-le-Fylde, said her cancer made it painful to sit on a hard chair for long periods of time. \n\"I actually said to the doctor, 'You better find me some blankets and a pillow because I'm going to have to lie down',\" she said.\n\"I said 'I can't sit down any longer and I'll just lie on the floor' and he seemed to be quite happy to provide me with a blanket and a pillow. \n\"It was very uncomfortable, not where a terminally ill patient who is vulnerable and prone to infection should be - not where anybody should be.\"\nMrs Butcher's husband, John, took a picture of his wife lying on the hospital floor, which has been seen by thousands of people after being shared online. \nHe said: \"I thought, 'This isn't right', so I took a picture, and it was only when I got home later that day and looked at the picture that it started to make me angry and that shouldn't have happened.\"\nThe picture was also posted on X by Chris Webb, MP for Blackpool South, and retweeted by Wes Streeting, before he was made secretary of state for health and social care after the general election. \nIn his post, Mr Webb said: \"The treatment that Madeleine Butcher has endured is absolutely unacceptable and it fills me with horror. \n\"No individual, especially someone who is facing the end of their life, should ever be subjected to sleeping on the cold, hard floor of a hospital.\"\nMrs Butcher said that within 30 minutes of lying on the floor two nurses found a trolley in a side room where she was able to spend the rest of her wait. \nShe hopes others do not have a similar experience in the future. \n\"If I could just make it better for the next person or the next few people who come along in the decision-making process I'll be happy with that,\" she said.\nMarie Forshaw, from Blackpool Teaching Hospitals, said she was \"deeply sorry\" this had happened, adding: \"It goes against our commitment to provide caring, safe, and respectful treatment to our patients and our communities.\" \nShe added: \"We are conducting a thorough investigation into the circumstances of this incident. \n\"Once the investigation is complete, we will do everything we can to ensure the learning from this occurrence is implemented to prevent such incidents in the future.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A couple have avoided prison after they admitted sharing indecent pictures and videos of young boys.\nThomas Anderson, 35, and Christopher Ternent, 39, sent each other nearly 100 category A, B and C images, York Crown Court heard on Wednesday.\nSome of the videos portrayed the sexual abuse of children as young as four to six years old.\nAfter pleading guilty at an earlier hearing, they were each handed a nine-month custodial sentence, suspended for 12 months.\nAnderson and Ternent were first arrested by North Yorkshire Police in July 2020, when they were living in Harrogate town centre, and the indecent images were found on their mobile phones. \nThe offending dated back to 2011.\nProsecutor Rachel Landin said chat logs were also uncovered in which the men discussed their \"fantasies\" in relation to the content.\nJudge Sean Morris told the defendants it was \"unusual to see what was in the minds of people looking at these images\".\n\"But it is what every paedophile will be thinking,\" he said.\nTernent's defence counsel, David Ward, said his client had been on a \"slippery slope\" with his consumption of pornography.\nHe had become \"more and more isolated\" and felt \"shame and disgust\" at his actions, Mr Ward said. \nHe added that Ternent had had to take a lower-paying job due to the offences and the couple had been attacked, prompting them to move house and leave the Harrogate area.\nAnderson's counsel, Joel Wootton, said his mental health had \"fallen off a cliff\" since the arrests in 2020. \nAnderson described himself as an alcoholic and needs to be cared for by Ternent.\nJudge Morris said the case was \"ancient history\" due to policing backlogs with crime involving technology. \nHe added that there was \"every prospect of rehabilitation\", as there had been no further offending in the four years since. \nThe couple, who are now listed as living in Middlesbrough, were also given a sexual harm prevention order to last five years.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "A man who strangled his wife for having an online affair and dumped her body in a river has been found guilty of murder.\nAminan Rahman, 46, from east London, attacked 24-year-old Suma Begum during a video call with her boyfriend last April, the Old Bailey heard.\nThe jury was told how Rahman put her into a suitcase after choking her, at which point she might still have been alive.\nRahman is due to be sentenced on 31 July.\nThe court heard that Rahman had \"most likely\" killed Ms Begum \"there and then\" at their flat in Tower Hamlets on the night of 29 April 2023, but had at the very least \"incapacitated\" her before placing her body in the suitcase and dumping it in the River Lea.\n\"If not already dead by then, she would have inevitably have drowned,\" said prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward.\nThe suitcase was found 10 days later by a member of the public washed up on the riverbank downstream, still containing the body of Ms Begum.\nCCTV footage released by the Metropolitan Police shows Rahman leaving the block of flats, holding a child in one arm and pulling a suitcase with the other. A second clip shows him next to the river with the suitcase before throwing it in.  \nMs Begum had undergone an Islamic marriage over the telephone in 2019 when Rahman was in London and she was in Bangladesh, the court heard.\nThey had first lived in Somerset as husband and wife, where Rahman worked as a chef, before moving to east London in April 2023 where they stayed at a flat in the Docklands with their two children.\nMs Begum had started an \"intimate\" online relationship with a man her own age, Shahin Miah, who was living in the United Arab Emirates, and they \"hoped in due course to be together\", said Ms Ledward.\nOn the night of Ms Begum's murder, her neighbours heard children screaming and a loud bang against the wall.\nThat same night, the jury heard, Mr Miah received a WhatsApp video call from Rahman.\nWhen he gave evidence during the one-month trial, Mr Miah sobbed as he told jurors how Rahman had threatened to kill Ms Begum, who was in the background of the call.\n\"She wanted to run away and then he grabbed her by the throat,\" he said.\nThe court heard how Mr Miah received another call later that night in which Rahman told him: \"Look, I have killed [her] and now you get ready.\"\nMr Miah told the Old Bailey: \"I saw that frothing was coming out of Suma's mouth and he showed me on the video and he was swearing at me.\"\nThe jury was shown CCTV of Rahman leaving the flat he shared with his wife shortly afterwards, carrying one of their children and pulling a large black suitcase.\nFurther footage was played of Rahman lifting the suitcase on to a metal barrier and pushing it into the River Lea.\n\"There is no dispute that Suma Begum was in that suitcase - placed there by the defendant,\" said Ms Ledward.\nGiving evidence in his defence, Rahman claimed that his wife had demanded money from him to help her boyfriend join her in England.\nHe alleged that she had threatened to hit their elder child unless he gave her \u00a310,000.\nRahman also claimed he had then grabbed his wife around the neck with both hands in order to defend the child, when Ms Begum collapsed to the floor.\nHe then \"panicked\" and put her body into a suitcase, the court heard.\nRahman pleaded guilty before his trial to a charge of preventing the lawful and decent burial of her body.\nFollowing the trial, the Metropolitan Police said the video call made by Rahman was \"vital\" to securing his conviction.\nDet Ch Insp Kelly Allen, the lead investigator in the case, said: \"Once Aminan Rahman was swiftly identified as the prime suspect, my team of homicide detectives analysed hundreds of hours of CCTV to trace his movements before and after the murder.\n\"We also managed to retrieve and download the full video call that Rahman made to Suma's believed boyfriend. This further proved he killed her in a jealous rage.\"\nIt had been a \"challenging case\" and the victim's loved ones \"have had to endure a trial in which they heard graphic details of how her body was hidden by her husband\", she added.",
    "Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, in a visit that has been heavily criticised by EU leaders and Ukraine's government. \nFriday's meeting was part of what Mr Orban called a \"peace mission\", coming three days  after a visit to Kyiv where he met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nHungary has just taken over the presidency of the Council of the European Union, but EU leaders have stressed that Mr Orban is not acting on behalf of the bloc. \nMr Orban is the EU's only head of government to have kept close ties to the Kremlin following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nAfter the meeting, which lasted several hours, Hungary's PM said Russia and Ukraine were still \"far apart\" in their views on achieving peace. \n\"Many steps are needed to end the war, but we took the first step to restore dialogue,\" he said. \nThe Russian leader called it a \"frank and useful\" conversation. He also repeated a previously rejected proposal for Ukraine to withdraw from regions in the south and east of the country which Russia claims to have annexed - an area that includes territory Russia does not currently occupy.\nVolodymyr Zelensky has long said Ukraine will not negotiate with Moscow until Russian forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea.\nEarlier, Mr Putin said Mr Orban was visiting \"not just as a long-time partner\" but as a European Union representative. \nHowever, European leaders openly condemned the Moscow trip and emphasised he was not representing the EU. \n\"The EU rotating presidency has no mandate to engage with Russia on behalf of the EU,\" Charles Michel, President of the European Council, wrote on X. \n\"The European Council is clear: Russia is the aggressor, Ukraine is the victim. No discussions about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine.\"\n\"Appeasement will not stop Putin,\" European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X.\nUkraine also condemned the visit: \"For our country, the principle of 'no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine' remains inviolable and we call on all states to strictly adhere to it,\" the foreign ministry said a statement. \nEarlier this week, Mr Orban visited Kyiv, saying \"a quick ceasefire could be used to speed up peace negotiations\".\nPresident Zelensky - who has had frosty relations with Mr Orban - did not publicly respond to the proposal. \nAhead of Ukraine\u2019s offensive last summer, Mr Orban warned that Ukraine cannot win on the battlefield. \nSince the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Hungarian prime minister has underlined that Russia\u2019s advantage in resources and men makes Putin\u2019s country unbeatable. \nHowever, many Ukrainians believe any ceasefire would simply cement Russia\u2019s hold over territory it has seized from Ukraine and, if negotiations were to take place, they would prefer them to be conducted from a position of strength rather than on the back foot.\nMr Orban has been a vocal critic of Western support for Ukraine. He previously slowed agreement on a \u20ac50bn ($54bn; \u00a342bn) EU aid package designed to support Ukraine in its defence against Russia.\nTuesday's visit to Kyiv was his first in 12 years, while he met Mr Putin repeatedly during that time.\nDuring Mr Orban's joint appearance with Mr Zelensky, the body language between them was not warm, and neither took questions from the media after they gave their statements.\nBut for the next six months Mr Orban's position as head of the Council of the European Union means he has an influential role as a figurehead for Europe. \nHis visit to Kyiv came on his second day in that role, saying there was a need to solve previous disagreements and focus on the future.",

    "The number of people killed in a crush at a religious gathering in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has risen to 121, making it one of the deadliest such disasters in more than a decade.\nThe incident took place during a satsang (a Hindu religious festival) in Hathras district on Tuesday. \nPolice said the number of people present at the venue was three times the permitted limit and most of those who died or were injured were women.\nA case has been registered against the event's organisers.\nThe tragedy has sparked outrage in India, and has led to questions about lapses in safety measures.\nWhat happened?\nThe crush took place in Pulrai village, where a self-styled godman called Bhole Baba was holding a religious gathering.\nOfficials said the event was massively overcrowded. \nAuthorities had given permission for 80,000 people to gather but around 250,000 people attended the event, according to the first information report (FIR) lodged by the police. \nChaos broke out at the end of the event as the preacher was about to leave in his car. \nThe police report said thousands of devotees ran towards his vehicle and began collecting dust from the path in an act of devotion. \nAs crowds swelled, several of those sitting and squatting on the ground got crushed.\nThe document added that some people tried running to a patch of mud-filled fields across the road, but were forcibly stopped by the organisers and were crushed.  \nPolice have registered a case against a man who they say was the event's main organiser and a few others on several charges, including culpable homicide. \nOn Tuesday, distressing images from the site were circulated online. \nSome videos showed the injured being taken to hospitals in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks and even motorbikes.\nOther clips showed distraught family members screaming outside a local hospital as they tried to find their loved ones among rows of bodies left at the entrance. \nBunty, who uses only one name and comes from the state's Aligarh district, said he was devastated at the loss of his mother. \nHe saw her body lying outside a hospital on a news channel on Tuesday evening. \n\"But when I went there, I could not find my mother and have since been trying to locate her body,\" he told BBC Hindi. \nOthers expressed anger over the incident. \nRitesh Kumar, whose 28-year-old wife was among those killed, said his life had been upended.\n\u201cMy family has been destroyed. The government should see to it that we get justice,\u201d he said.\nWho is Bhole Baba?\nThe self-styled godman's original name is Suraj Pal but he reportedly re-christened himself Narayan Sakar Vishwa Hari. His devotees call him Bhole Baba.\nHe hails from Bahadurpur village in Kasganj district, which is about 65km (40 miles) from Hathras.\nSanjay Kumar, a senior police officer in the state, told BBC Hindi that he was a constable in the police but was suspended from service after a criminal case was lodged against him.\nHe was reinstated in the force after a court cleared him but left his job in 2002, Mr Kumar added.\nDetails about his life are sketchy, but Mr Kumar says that after leaving the force, he began to call himself Bhole Baba.\nHe does not have much social media presence, but has hundreds of thousands of followers in Hathras and neighbouring districts.\nHuge crowds attend his sermons where he is mostly seen in white clothes.\nSince the tragedy, the preacher is believed to be hiding in his ashram in Mainpuri, about 100km (62 miles) from Pulrai village.\nShalabh Mathur, a senior official in Aligarh police, said a search was underway to find him and question him.\nPolice say he runs an organisation called the Ram Kutir Charitable Trust, which was also the main organiser of Tuesday's event. \nSatsangs are events where people gather to pray, sing devotional songs or listen to a preacher and they are often attended by a large number of women.\nGomti Devi, who was present at the event, said she had a lot of faith in the Bhole Baba. \nShe said she wears a locket with his photo because he \"cures diseases, ends domestic troubles, and provides employment\".\nAdditional reporting by Abhishek Mathur in Hathras and Dinesh Shakya for BBC Hindi",
    "Carlsberg has agreed a \u00a33.3bn deal to buy Britvic, the company which makes drinks such as Robinsons squash and J20.\nThe Danish brewer said it would create a single beverage company called Carlsberg Britvic to grow its business in the UK and western Europe.\nBritvic chairman Ian Durant said the merits of Carlsberg's takeover offer were \"compelling\".\nThe deal will see existing Britvic investors receive \u00a313.15 a share, after a previous lower offer was rejected last month.\nMr Durant said the takeover by Carlsberg would create \"an enlarged international group that is well-placed to capture the growth opportunities in multiple drinks sectors\".\nBritvic shareholders will vote on the proposed takeover at a general meeting in the coming months.\nThe soft drinks company posted strong results for the latest quarter, despite wet weather across Europe, with group revenues growing by 6.3% to \u00a3502.9m in the three months to June 30.\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Britvic would add \"some diversification\" to Carlsberg's portfolio.\n\"The Danish outfit is having to react to a world in which younger age groups are less likely to indulge heavily in alcohol,\" he said.\nBritvic holds an exclusive licence with US firm PepsiCo to make and sell brands such as Pepsi, 7up and Lipton iced tea in the UK, and Carlsberg also has a bottling deal with the US company.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the takeover would give Carlsberg the chance to expand its global partnership with PepsiCo \"and streamline its bottling operations across European markets and now the UK\".\nIn a separate deal on Monday, Carlsberg also agreed to take control of its UK brewing joint venture with Marston's, which makes beers including Hobgoblin and Pedigree.\nMarston's confirmed it will receive \u00a3206m to sell Carlsberg its 40% stake in the venture.\n\"It\u2019s rare to see a business do two deals in one day, but sometimes the stars simply align,\" added Mr Mould. \n\"The concurrent decision to buy Marston\u2019s out of the pair\u2019s brewing joint venture suggests beer remains a big part of Carlsberg\u2019s ongoing story.\"",
    "The drill rapper son of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police 13 years ago, has been jailed for five years for having a gun.\nKemani Duggan, 23, who is known as Bandokay, admitted having a Tokarev pistol and 22 bulleted cartridges with intent to cause fear of violence.\nHis associate Abdou Bojang, 22, from Hackney, north London, pleaded guilty to possession of a prohibited firearm and ammunition without a firearm certification and was also handed a five-year jail term.\nThe pair, who are associated with a north London gang, were sentenced earlier at the Old Bailey.\nThe court heard how police had raided Bojang's parents' flat in Hackney on 21 March last year.\nThe firearm and rounds were discovered in the communal underground car park on a concrete ledge inside a JD Sports bag which also contained two foot-long (60cm) knives.\nDuggan's DNA was identified on the gun slide and he was arrested at Gatwick airport on 13 January.\nOn his phone was a Snapchat photograph of the same gun and 23 rounds.\nJust before the gun was found, Bojang had messaged Duggan: \"Yooo bro, where yu, There's feds in my block akh. I might be getting nicked.\"\nDiana Wilson, prosecuting, said Duggan, of Islington, north London, was a well-known drill artist associated with the Old Farm Boys (OFB) criminal gang based on the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham.\nShe said: \"The prosecution expert has concluded that there is no question that over the years he is an elder or senior gang member in the OFB.\n\"One consequence of this is that he would naturally be at a heightened risk of violence from rival gang members, this would be additionally heightened by his status as a successful drill artist and the son of Mark Duggan which raises his profile to would-be attackers.\"\nShe added: \"As a result of his fame, he has become a target for violence from others associated with urban street gangs.\"\nMs Wilson said that Duggan's accepted plea was made on the basis that he was provided with a firearm and ammunition to protect himself.\nDuggan had asserted that he would only have carried the gun to \"scare any prospective aggressor away\".\nMitigating, Gregory Fishwick said Duggan expressed the long-term effects of losing his father in his lyrics.\nDespite growing up in an area where he was seen as \"no more than his father's son\", Duggan had \"tried to get away from that\" and be a \"proper father\" to his own son, Mr Fishwick said.\nSentencing, Judge Philip Katz KC said: \"It is accepted that there were grounds for a fear that people might try to attack you, Duggan.\n\"You have a high profile, arising not only from your own career as an artist in the genre of drill rap, with all its gang associations, but also from your unfortunate life history.\"\nThe defendants waved to supporters in the public gallery as they were sent down from the dock.\nDuggan was 11 when his 29-year-old father Mark Duggan was shot dead in Tottenham, north London, in August 2011.\nArmed officers had intercepted a minicab Mr Duggan was travelling in on the basis of intelligence that he was carrying a gun.\nA pistol was later found around seven metres away from the minicab.\nMr Duggan's shooting in August 2011, by an officer known only as V53, sparked riots in London, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester and other English cities for nearly a week.",

    "Penalties \u2013 the word has long struck fear in the hearts of England fans.\nBut on Saturday, Gareth Southgate's men defied England's less-than-ideal record in major tournaments, dispatching all five against Switzerland to make it through to tonight's Euro 2024 semi-final versus the Netherlands.\nNow a graduate from Nottinghamshire has told the BBC he believes he holds the secret to shootout success.\nBilly Watson, 21, from Kimberley, has combined maths, statistics and psychology to calculate the best place to aim in penalties. \n\"The conventional wisdom is that you shoot down the middle, but if you keep shooting down the middle, your keeper is going to understand what your strategy is,\" Mr Watson said.\nInstead, he says his calculations show players should use a mixed system - aiming for the top left or top right, and down the middle only very occasionally. \n\"I used a branch of mathematics called game theory to try and understand why penalty takers don't shoot down the middle, even though that is statistically supposedly the best place to put it,\" said Mr Watson.\nHe was the first in his family to go to university, and has just graduated from King's College London with a degree in PPE - politics, philosophy and economics.\nMr Watson decided to carry out the research for his dissertation after watching an episode of BBC panel show QI - which concluded that the middle is the best place for a penalty to go.\nThat did not feel quite right to him. \n\"Actually if you shoot down the middle every time, the keeper will understand what your strategy is and they're going to stay in the middle,\" Mr Watson said.\n\"So what you want is a mixed strategy, where you shoot in the top left a percentage of the time and the top right a percentage of the time.\"\nHe said his dissertation impressed his tutor, who suggested he would look to publish it in Math Plus Magazine at University of Cambridge - and it achieved an impressive first-class mark of 85.\nFollowing England's quarter-final success against the Swiss, Mr Watson said Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka, Ivan Toney and Trent Alexander-Arnold \"broadly\" followed his model.\n\"They didn't shoot down the middle and they shot left 60% of the time and right 40% of the time,\" he said.\n\"Something else I found interesting was the difference between [Manuel] Akanji's penalty and [Xherdan] Shaqiri's. Akanji shot low, making it quite an easy save for [Jordan] Pickford, but Shaqiri shot high. \n\"Even though Pickford guessed the direction of both penalties correctly, the extra height in Shaqiri's made all the difference.

    "Two axe-heads, which are believed to be more than 4,000 years old, have been sent to the National Museum of Ireland by an anonymous letter writer.\nStaff at the museum described them as a \"significant archaeological find\".\nThey are now trying to trace the sender to find out more about the artefacts. \nThe letter stated that the axe-heads were discovered in County Westmeath using a metal detector.\nA photo released by the museum appears to show the Bronze Age items packaged into a flapjack box. \nStaff said the artefacts were \"thoughtfully packed in foam cut-outs and cardboard, ensuring their safe arrival\".\nThey added the sender \"expressed a desire for the axe-heads to be conserved by the museum\" but said the letter did not provide any further specifics about their origin.\nStaff have now appealed to the sender to contact them again, saying it is \"crucial\" that archaeological experts are informed of the the exact location of the find.\n\"We are thrilled about the discovery of these Early Bronze Age axe-heads,\" said Matt Seaver, Assistant Keeper of Irish Antiquities at the museum. \nBut he added that to \"truly understand their significance, we need to know where they were found\".\nThe museum explained that knowing the context of archaeological discoveries helps experts \"piece together ancient settlement patterns and cultural practices\".\nStaff used their appeal to the sender to remind the general public about the law on metal detecting.\nIt is illegal to use a metal detector to search for archaeological objects anywhere in the Republic of Ireland, unless you have written permission from the government. \nThose convicted of the offence can face a fine ranging to more than \u20ac63,000 (\u00a353,000).\nThey can also be sentenced to up to three months in prison instead of - or sometimes in addition to - the large fine. \nThe museum explained those \"severe penalties\" are in place because unauthorised metal detecting can cause \"serious damage to Ireland\u2019s archaeological heritage\".\nHowever, appealing to the sender to get back in touch, staff said information about the discovery of the axe-heads would be \"treated with the utmost confidentiality and used solely to verify the find location and its circumstances\".\nThe museum is based across four sites but its archaeology section is located in Dublin's Kildare Street.\nThe flat axe-heads were received by staff at the end of June.\nArchaeological experts estimate that they date from some time between the years 2150 and 2000 BC.\nMr Seaver said it is the role of National Museum of Ireland to \"preserve these treasures for everyone in the State\".\nHe also reminded members of the public that it is their \"legal duty to report the discovery of archaeological objects\". \nA similar incident happened in 2016 when anonymous packages containing Bronze Age axes and Viking jewellery were sent to the Kildare Street site.

    "An investigation of the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) by the UK\u2019s environmental watchdog is \u201cunsurprising but very concerning\u201d, the minister has told a Stormont committee.\nAndrew Muir said on Monday that he was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d about the Executive's failure to approve the plan, which will become Northern Ireland\u2019s first environmental strategy.\nThe Office for Environmental Protection is examining the failure to publish an Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP), which was due to have been published in July 2023 and has been with the Executive since March this year.\nPublishing the EIP is a legal obligation under climate change legislation.\nThe Office for Environmental Protection\u2019s action is its third investigation into Daera, following other environmental law failures.\nThe Office for Environmental Protection's Chief Executive Natalie Prosser said that while good governance was important, the EIP was \u201cessential\u201d for transparency on how government intends to deliver on Northern Ireland\u2019s environmental challenges.\n\u201cIt should provide a roadmap on to how Northern Ireland\u2019s environment is to be significantly improved,\" she added.\n\u201cWe know when it comes to the environment that time is not on our side.\n\u201cThe recent issues seen at Lough Neagh highlight the need for urgent action to protect the environment.\n\u201cThe EIP is a vital part of that, and delays to its publication and implementation must be kept to a minimum.\u201d\nIn a \u201ctwin-track approach\u201d, the minister has also tabled the Lough Neagh Report and Action Plan.\nHe added that the EIP had been updated on feedback from the body and welcomed additional funding awarded in the June monitoring round last week.\n\u201cAny money my department receives, we will gratefully take it and scale up the interventions we can make in relation to that,\u201d he said.\nMr Muir said the issue of environmental protection was an issue that was \u201ccoming up day and daily\u201d in his conversations with people.\nIn a statement after the committee, Daera said the decision by the body to open an investigation is \"not unexpected\".\n\"Whilst the Office for Environmental Protection has been sympathetic to the reasons for not meeting the deadline during the suspension of the Assembly, it has a reasonable expectation that positive progress should have been made upon the return of ministers,\" it added.\nIt added the department's officials will engage \"constructively\" with the body as it carries out its investigation.\nDaera was issued an information notice under the Office for Environmental Protection's enforcement procedures on 3 June, but details have just emerged due to the pre-election sensitivity period.\nThe department has two months from that date to respond and say whether or not it agrees with the OEP\u2019s view and to set out any proposed actions to address the issue.\nThe EIP is regarded as a blueprint of how the Stormont government will meet its environmental goals.\nTwo complaints were received by the body regarding the failure to publish an EIP.\nBut the office has launched this investigation independently.\nIf it finds a failure to comply with environmental law, the body will aim to resolve that through co-operation, dialogue and agreement with public departments and authorities.\nUltimately, it can use its stricter enforcement powers including, if necessary, court proceedings.\nSean Kelly from Northern Ireland Environment Link said it is \"disappointing\" that the plan has not yet received necessary support from the Executive Office.\n\"In a time of climate and biodiversity crises it would be good to get a better understanding of the issues that are currently preventing its publication,\" he said.\nHe added there is a \"legal and an environmental imperative\" that the EIP is published \"as a matter of urgency and without further delay\" so that all stakeholders \"can play a constructive part in its delivery\".\nIn a statement, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said it welcomed the watchdog's investigation.\n\"The publication of the EIP is a legal requirement and this should have happened by 25 July 2023,\" RSPB NI head of policy John Martin said.\n\"As we approach the one-year anniversary of this missed deadline for nature, it is critical that the EIP and the steps it sets out for Northern Ireland government to significantly improve the natural environment is published as a matter of urgency.\n\"There simply is no more time for delay \u2013 nature can\u2019t wait',\" he added.",
    "A nine-year-old chess prodigy is set to make history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport.\nBodhana Sivanandan, from Harrow, north-west London, will join the England Women\u2019s Team at the Chess Olympiad in Hungary later this year.\nShe is almost 15 years younger than the next-youngest teammate, 23-year-old Lan Yao. \n\"I found out yesterday after I came back from school, when my dad told me,\"  Bodhana told the BBC. \"I was happy. I hope I\u2019ll do well, and I\u2019ll get another title.\" \nMalcolm Pein, manager of the England chess team, says the schoolgirl is the most remarkable prodigy British Chess has ever seen.\n\"It\u2019s exciting - she\u2019s on course to be one of the best British players ever,\" he said. \nHowever the nine-year-old's father, Siva, says he is mystified as to where his daughter got her talent from. \n\"I\u2019m an engineering graduate, as is my wife, but I\u2019m not good at chess,\u201d he told the BBC. \"I tried a couple of league games, but I was very poor.\" \nBodhana first picked up a pawn during the pandemic.\n\"When one of my dad\u2019s friends was going back to India, he gave us a few bags [of possessions],\u201d Bodhana said. \"There was a chess board, and I was interested in the pieces so I started playing.\"\nShe says chess makes her feel \"good\" and helps her with \"lots of other things like maths, how to calculate\". \nTwo years ago, Bodhana won all three chess world championships for the under eight age group - in the classical game, where a match lasts several hours, the rapid game, which lasts up to an hour, and the blitz game, which can be as short as three minutes.\nAs for preparation for Hungary, Bodhana is taking it very seriously. \n\"On school days I practice for around one hour every day,\u201d she said. \"On the weekends, I usually play tournaments, but when I don\u2019t I practice for more than an hour.\"\nWhile some of her teammates are old enough to be her grandparents, Bodhana is not the only upcoming young talent. \nThe game is seeing a surge of interest among young people, according to Mr Pein, which he attributes to two factors - the legacy of the lockdowns and the impact of smash-hit Netflix drama The Queen\u2019s Gambit, which is about a gifted female chess player.\nMr Pein says he feels \"very confident\" that his prodigy will achieve her ultimate goal and become a grandmaster, the highest title in international chess. \nAbhimanyu Mishra, from the US, holds the record for the youngest person to reach grandmaster in 2021, when he was just 12.\nBut Bodhana says she intends to clinch the title at the tender age of 10. One year, she is keen to point out, before she finishes primary school. ",
    "A pod of 77 pilot whales has died after washing ashore on a beach in Orkney in what could be the biggest mass stranding for decades.\nThe British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) had established 12 of the animals at Tresness Beach on the island of Sanday were still alive when they came out of the water.\nHowever the decision was taken to euthanise them after refloating efforts failed.\nThe pod included male whales up to seven metres (22ft) long as well as females, calves and juveniles.\nExperts say it is too early to know what has caused the stranding, but it is likely one of the whales got into trouble and the rest of the pod tried to help.\nMembers of the public are being asked to stay away from the area while post mortem examinations are carried out.\nIt is thought to be the largest stranding event in Scotland since at least 1995, when the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS) was founded - though strandings of a similar scale have been seen in recent years.\nLast year an entire pod of 55 pilot whales died following a stranding on Lewis.\nOnly 15 of the whales were alive when they were washed ashore. One was successfully re-floated while the rest had to be euthanised.\nBetween 60-70 of the animals came into shallow waters in Sutherland in 2011.\nAccording to the Natural History Museum, the largest UK stranding took place in 1927 when 126 out of more than 130 false killer whales died in the Dornoch Firth in the Highlands.\nExperts from the BDMLR, the Scottish SPCA and marine vets from the Scottish mainland travelled to Sanday to assess whether any of the whales could be saved.\nThe area was cut off by the high tide and the sand on the beach where they were stranded proved too soft to allow the mammals to be righted. \nThe whales needed to be moved back into an upright position as quickly as possible if there is to be any chance of saving them.\nBut the soft sand meant the whales fell back over when the rescuers attempted to right them.\nEmma Neave-Webb from the BDMLR said early on that while these experiences are difficult, the thinking had to be \"realistic\".\nBDMLR medics were brought in from mainland Orkney and Inverness to help with the rescue attempt, but Ms Neave-Webb said it appeared the whales had been stranded for \"quite some time\".\nShe described the scene as \"really quite horrible\" and \"hugely emotional\".\nRescuers attempted to keep the whales alive by pouring sea water over them, but the decision was later taken to euthanise them.\nA spokesperson for Orkney Islands Council said discussions were taking place with community representatives on how best to dispose of the bodies.\nThey said: \"In previous circumstances where whales have beached on our shores and subsequently died, the approach from our Environmental Health team around disposing of the body has been to allow nature to take its course - with the public advised to stay away from the area.\n\"Our assessment in this case, given the scale and the likely public health implications, is that more definite action will need to be taken, for example burying them where they are or removing the bodies to a large grave site elsewhere.\"\nAndrew Brownlow of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme said mass strandings of this scale are becoming more common in Scotland.\nHe told BBC News: \"It used to be quite unusual to have a mass stranding event, certainly of this  size. \n\"But over the last ten years or so we have seen an increase both in the number of mass stranding events around Scotland and also the size of the mass and the number of animals that it involves. \n\"So that is slightly concerning and that might be because there are just more animals out there, or it could be that there are more hazards that these animals are exposed to.\u201d",
    "Pop legends Sugababes say their stint at TRNSMT has been \"just as much fun as Glastonbury\" after getting crowds dancing to a hit-packed set.\nThe trio were one of the big draws on the first day of Scotland's biggest festival in Glasgow, with 50,000 people expected to attend each day over the weekend.\nPerforming in their original line-up, Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena and Siobhan Donaghy were in such high demand at Glastonbury recently that organisers had to shut off their stage.\nSpeaking to BBC News, Keisha said the reunited band were \"immensely grateful\" to get such a positive reaction in Glasgow.\nShe said: \"Festivals are much better now than when we started because you get so many different genres at them. \n\"Kids nowadays discover music in so many different ways, they don't know what decade it's from and don't care what genre it's from and line-ups have to reflect that.\"\nCrowds were dancing across the TRNSMT site as they were treated to Sugababes hits including About You Now and Push The Button.\nMutya added: \"It's a smaller scale to Glastonbury but TRNSMT is just as much fun. The people at both of them are out for a fun time - and the sun's out too!\"\nThe group added they hope to release a new album in \"due course\" and that they \"never have to worry about the crowd\" when in Scotland.\nThe festival will run from Friday to Sunday and is headlined by Liam Gallagher, Gerry Cinnamon and Calvin Harris.\nWarm and sunny weather accompanied the opening day, with acts including Garbage, the Snuts, the Last Dinner Party and Example playing across three stages. \nHowever some fans will have to chose between seeing the end of the headline performances and getting home, after rail operator ScotRail warned a reduced timetable meant the last train on some services will leave before each night concludes. \nFans arriving on Friday were in high spirits though, with the soulful sound of Jalen Ngonda opening proceedings on the Main Stage.\nFans in the VIP area were treated to a secret set by Scottish rock band Travis.\nThe band, who released their new album on Friday, agreed to the performance just two days ago.\nDuring the set, frontman Fran Healy told the crowd he had drank too much Irn Bru causing his hair to turn bright orange.\nHealy said they played at T in the Park on 10 occasions and it was \"possible\" they might play the Glasgow Green festival next year.\nSome people in the audience were tearful as they watched the band play hits including Flowers In The Window, and Sing.\nSpirits were high among the first fans to arrive at the festival - with anticipation already building for Saturday and Sunday headliners.\nHannah Brunatti was joined by her friends Kirsty Brown and Aqsa Riaz.\nShe told BBC News: \"I've seen Gerry Cinnamon before, when he played Hampden, and I'm really excited to see him again.\nAsqa added: \"I saw Calvin Harris before in Ibiza, so it'll be hard to top that - but I'm sure he'll be amazing.\"\nEvan Young was one of the earliest arrivals after gates opened.\nHe said: \"I'm looking forward to seeing Liam Gallagher - he's doing Definitely Maybe in full. \n\"I'm here for all three days so I'm wanting to see some of the smaller bands too, like the Reytons and Bilk.\"\nAnd not all the fans were from Scotland. \nThe Davis family - parents Simon and Sarah and children Pippa and Scarlett - had travelled from near Bristol and were looking forward to seeing Liam Gallagher and Declan McKenna.\nThey said they couldn't believe the good weather and were hoping it stayed the same all weekend.\nMcKenna himself was glad to be at the event. \nHe told BBC Scotland News: \"I'm just trying to stay calm and relaxed - there's massages backstage.\n\"There's a really good energy in the crowd.\"\nScotland's own The Snuts were given a heroes welcome when they arrived on the Main Stage in the early evening, with fans bouncing from the start.\nThe smaller King Tut's stage was more sedate during the afternoon, with many fans sprawled on the grass to enjoy the likes of singer-songwriter Nieve Ella's indie rock.\nThe atmosphere was more intense when chart-topping band The Last Dinner Party delivered a theatrical display of pop and rock.\nThe festival will continue until Sunday, with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris closing the event. \nWeather is expected to remain cloudy throughout Saturday, with the possibility of rain arriving on Sunday.\nIn a social media post ScotRail said that people going to the festival should \"consider their travel options home after the event has finished\" due to the ongoing reduction in services. \nMusic fans who are not going can follow the festival through the BBC all weekend.\nBBC One and BBC Scotland will present highlights every night while a number of full performances will also be available to watch on the iPlayer.\nBBC Radio 1 and Radio Scotland will also be broadcasting live from the festival, with acts including Chase & Status, Courteeners, Natasha Bedingfield, CMAT and Enter Shikari all lined up to appear.\nThis is the seventh instalment of the ",

    "By the signing of a royal decree, the new right-wing Dutch government has become a reality.\nDefying analysts\u2019 expectations, it swept to power on a crescendo of discontent that has boosted anti-immigration parties across the continent.\nHigh cost of living, environmental issues, and a perceived failure to manage the asylum system were some of the key issues ahead of the November 2023 election.\nAfter months of political wrangling, an agreement was reached for the new Dutch government to be led by a surprise pick - the former head of the Dutch intelligence service, Dick Schoof.\nMr Schoof was the fifth person approached to preside over the eclectic coalition, and among the few palatable candidates for all four parties.\nHe pushed back a planned retirement to take over from Mark Rutte, the Netherlands longest serving prime minister who has packed his cardboard boxes in preparation for a move to Brussels to take over as the new NATO Secretary General.\nThe coalition Mr Schoof will govern includes Geert Wilders' anti-immigration, far-right PVV as the largest party.\nThe other members of the coalition will be the conservative-liberal VVD, the Farmers' Citizen Movement and the new-to-government centrist New Social Contract which promised to restore public trust in politics.\nThe VVD and New Social Contract parties have pledged to ensure Mr Wilders\u2019 populist right is kept in check - and Mr Wilders has been forced to water down his party's most extreme policies in order to keep the three other coalition parties on board.\nPledges to ban the Quran, close Dutch borders and hold a referendum on the Netherlands future within the EU have been put on ice, along with Mr Wilders' own prime ministerial ambitions.\nYet, as leader of the largest party within the coalition, he is still expected to be one of the most influential politicians in parliament.\nAs the new government takes power, three new ministries have been created, to allow each coalition party to install one of its own politicians in the field in which it places the greatest importance.\nBBB has been given the housing ministry, VVD the climate and green growth ministry, and Mr Wilders\u2019 PVV the immigration ministry.\nMr Wilders initial choice for immigration minister Gidi Markuszower - an MP since 2017 - was vetoed by parliament, after he failed to pass intelligence service security checks. Previously, in 2010, he had to withdraw as a PVV candidate for parliament after it emerged he had been flagged up by the intelligence service as a \u201crisk to the integrity of the Netherlands\u201d.\nThe second choice, Marjolein Faber, has come under scrutiny over her endorsement of the racist Great Replacement conspiracy theory which claims elites are importing migrants to replace the white majority.\nElsewhere, the new agriculture minister is Femke Wiersma, who found fame more than a decade ago on the country's popular \"Farmer seeks Wife\" reality TV show.\nShe has since joined the Farmer Citizen Movement (BBB) which has spearheaded an uprising among farmers outraged by the previous government and EU plans to curb their activities to achieve ambitious climate targets.\nIn the 2023 provincial elections, BBB stunned Dutch politics by securing almost 20% of the vote.\nThe European Union will be watching with trepidation to see how the new Dutch government responds to multiple challenges, including immigration and the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\nWhile right wing parties in France are following this historic moment in the Netherlands with a sense of anticipation that the political pendulum is poised to swing in their direction- ahead of the second round of the French election on 7th July.\nGeert Wilders promised to make the Netherlands number one, and the Dutch are about to find out what that means.",

    "Teachers are working with a charity to find enough beds for thousands of sleep deprived children.\nMark Tilling, headteacher of Hartlepool's High Tunstall College of Science, took action after learning of an increasing number of families struggling to afford beds for their children.\nHe said bed poverty was rising and pupils were arriving at their desks too exhausted to learn.\nHe has joined a project aiming to deliver10,000 beds to youngsters across the Tees Valley over the next three years.\nAbout one million children in the UK sleep on the floor or share a bed, according to estimates from charity Barnardo's in a 2023 report.\nWhen Mr Tilling learned of this, he took action to help families in the Tees Valley by raising more than \u00a370,000 and partnering with Zarach, a Leeds-based charity working to \"lift children out of bed poverty\".\n\"If for any reason a child doesn't have a bed, we want to provide it,\" he said.\n\"If their bed's broken and they need a replacement, but don't have the finances, or if they've fled domestic violence or moved somewhere without furniture, we want to help because good sleep leads to good learning.\"\nSleep deprivation is affecting the concentration, attendance, behaviour and ability of a growing number of children, he believes.\n\"It's a multitude of factors and it all affects their outcomes at the end of schooling,\" he said.\n\"It's sad that we're in the 21st century and having to help people by getting these beds out, but I'd rather be doing something than not.\n\"It's a national issue and we need to give families the support they need for every young person to reach their potential.\"\nThe project is being supported by schools across the Tees Valley area, who can refer families for help.\nHartlepool's Rift House Primary School already provides children with food, equipment and a place to sleep if they need it.\nThe impact of the cost-of-living crisis and the coronavirus pandemic has left families facing \"difficult\" economic situations, headteacher Dave Turner said.\n\"Almost accidentally, a lot of schools have become an important hub in the community,\" he added.\n\"For a lot of our families, we're the first point of contact in any crisis and we'll do whatever we can.\"\nMr Turner called the bed poverty project a \"wonderful initiative\" that will enable the school to provide further help to pupils whose \"circumstances change overnight\".\n\"Children do come in very tired and if they need to sleep, we allow that to happen,\" he said.\n\"We need to make sure our children are in the best place possible when they're sitting at their desks and a good night's sleep is really important.\"\nZarach's National Development Manager Jess Sandy said more than half of Hartlepool's schools are now signed up to the initiative.\nShe said those who are referred by the schools for support will receive a new bed with mattress, bedding and a set of pyjamas.\nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "It was no surprise that one of the first announcements by the new Labour government was a promise to build more homes.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said a new taskforce would kickstart the stalled  development of Northstowe, Cambridgeshire.\nMs Reeves also announced plans to reintroduce mandatory housebuilding targets.\nLord John Fuller, a former council leader, has warned that targets were not necessarily the answer.\nThe availability and affordability of housing was an issue that kept coming up on the doorsteps during the election campaign - and the problem is particularly acute in the East of England. \nA recent study by the estate agent Savills concluded that the region needs to build 36,000 new homes a year to meet demand, but only 30,000 were completed.\nIt also named north Norfolk, Great Yarmouth, Ipswich, south Essex and parts of Hertfordshire as places where the delivery of new housing was meeting less than half the local need.\nA report by the East of England local government association last year found that 236,000 sites in the region, which had been given planning permission in 2022, had not been built on.\nThere is not much extra money being made available at the moment, although the government said it will help fund 300 planning officers.\nInstead ministers appear to hope that by focusing on the issue they can get plans moving. \nLocal councils have been asked to review their green belt boundaries and prioritise brownfield and \"grey belt\" land for development.\nDeputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said she will consider the economic benefits of any planning applications that cross her desk. The regional mayors - including Nik Johnson, the mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough - were invited to Downing Street on Monday and asked to use their local influence to help progress any plans for housing.\nThen there is the chancellor's \"taskforce\"  to kickstart stalled housing schemes, such as the one in Northstowe where 10,000 new homes have been planned but so far only about 1,400 have been built. \nJack Abbott, the Labour MP for Ipswich, told the Politics East programme: \"A taskforce alone is not a magic wand but what we've seen from the chancellor is a new focus on delivering. That is what we were elected to do.\"  \nThe government, more controversially, will reintroduce mandatory housebuilding targets for local councils.\nIt was not clear how these would work. Those with long memories will remember the regional assembly under the last Labour government, and how many local councillors did not like the idea of a regional body deciding where homes should go. \n\"We've been here before and it didn't work then and I don't suppose it'll work now,\" says Lord John Fuller, the former leader of South Norfolk Council\n\"I don't have a problem with targets but they must take into account the fact that some places can't build homes because of environmental considerations, like flooding or coastal erosion\"\nHe added that if the government was going to push for more housing, it must ensure that national agencies play a part.\nCharlotte Cane, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Ely and East Cambridgeshire, told Politics East that any imposed targets need to be part of a wider strategic overview. \n\"One of our big problems in Cambridgeshire is that we don't have enough water for new homes. The other problem is that the further out you go from where people work the more they will need proper public transport. \nThe government is expected to give more details of its plans for housing following next week's King's Speech, which will mark the opening of the new Parliament.   \nBBC Politics East will be broadcast on Sunday, 14th July at 10:00 GMT on BBC One in the East of England, and will be available after broadcast on BBC iPlayer.\nGot a story?

    "An orchard has been infested with \"unprecedented\" numbers of ermine moths.\nThe cider business, based near Kingsbury Episcopi in Somerset, has 15,000 trees and says at least half are currently infected.\nSomerset Cider Brandy doesn't use pesticides and says its only defence against the creatures is to buy ducks to eat the caterpillars.\nAn ermine moth is white with small black spots on the forewing, but the number of  spots can vary.\nThey form ghostly webbing over the leaves to protect themselves from predatory birds while they feast.\nMatilda Temperley is the managing director of Somerset Cider Brandy Company and says the weather is to blame.\n\"It's the result of our climate breakdown and we've been seeing different things each year but this year it's the apple ermine moth which is worse than anyone in living memory can say,\" she said.\n\"By taking all the leaves off the trees there'll be no harvest from them but if there's another stress event it's very likely the infected trees won't survive.\"\nThere's a real worry about the amount of trees that could be affected at Burrow Hill Cider Farm. \nIt isn't the flying moths that cause harm to the apple tree but, in spring, the trees are encased in thick cobwebs with eggs and larvae which can cause them stress and  the caterpillars of the apple ermine moth, which hatch in summer, can cause defoliation.\nIt can be treated using pesticides, something that Matilda Temperley is against.\n\"We'll pray for a really, really freezing cold winter. \n\"We are looking at potentially losing trees that have have been nurtured for the last three, four or five decades.\"\nShe does have one solution should the pests return next year.\n\"We'll buy ducks next year to at least catch the caterpillars when they're on the ground.\n\"We'll hope that this is an anomaly but it looks like it might not be because just the sheer volume of moths that will be flying around laying eggs in the next few weeks will lead to a thousand-fold of a problem next year.\"\nGeorge Tordoff is a senior ecologist at Butterfly Conservation and a moth expert.\nHe said: \"It's interesting that apple ermine is present in such numbers, usually this species is only present as small webs even on unsprayed, non-commercial trees and doesn't cause defoliation.\n\"The caterpillars feed in May and June and affected trees soon put on new growth afterwards, so the caterpillars are not thought to cause any long-term damage to the trees and don't need chemical control.\"\nHe also highlighted that the moths have an interesting way of avoiding being eaten by bats, they produce ultrasound when flying, which confuses the bats' echolocation systems.\nRelated Topics\nMoths\nNature\nCaterpillars\n",
    "Conditions at an immigration detention centre in west London were \"the worst\" in the country - and so bad the chief inspector of prisons says he raised concerns with the then home secretary.\nA report found Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre near Heathrow Airport was \"chaotic\", \"truly shocking\" and put detainees at \"imminent risk of harm\".\nThe overcrowded facility was described by Charlie Taylor from the prisons watchdog as \"decrepit\", with drug use and violence \"widespread\". He said he contacted James Cleverly in March but neither Mr Cleverly nor his department had responded.\nThe Home Office said staffing levels had been increased since the inspection. Mr Cleverly has been asked to comment.\nMitie Care and Custody, which runs Harmondsworth, said occupancy rates had been affected by the closure of some parts of the centre for refurbishment.\nAn Immigration Removal Centre (IRC) is a facility used to detain some individuals awaiting immigration decisions, deportation, or removal from the country.\nThe chief inspector's letter to Mr Cleverly was prompted by report findings that conditions at the centre had worsened since the previous inspection.\nThe number of assaults had doubled, there had been several serious suicide attempts and cells had been doubled up to hold more men.\nThe watchdog also found if detainees refused to share an overcrowded cell, they were held in a separation unit until they agreed. \nStaff largely kept to offices with \"do not enter\" taped across their doors, the watchdog warned.\nMr Taylor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"absolutely shocked walking into the place\".\n\"The whole place smelled of cannabis, there were detainees openly walking around smoking joints,\" he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that at an immigration [detention centre] or indeed a prison.\"\nMr Taylor earlier said: \u201cThe level of chaos that we found at Harmondsworth was truly shocking and we left deeply concerned that some of those held there were at imminent risk of harm.\n\u201cNobody should be detained in an immigration removal centre unless they are going to be removed quickly from the country, yet around 60% of detainees were released from the centre, with only a third deported, which begs the question of why so much taxpayer money was being spent keeping them locked up in the first place.\u201d\nMr Taylor wrote to the former Conservative home secretary Mr Cleverly on 12 March, after an inspection in February.\nHe said he \u201cset out the many failures at the centre\u201d but had \u201creceived no response\u201d.\nWhile the new director of Harmondsworth had a \u201cgood understanding\u201d of many of the challenges faced by the centre and was \u201cbeginning to make good progress\u201d in improving conditions, she will \u201cneed strong and consistent support at every level to succeed\u201d, Mr Taylor added.\nKolbassia Haoussou, a refugee who fled torture in Africa and now works for charity Freedom from Torture, said he was held in Harmondsworth when he first arrived in the UK in 2005.\nHe said he knows \u201conly too well how profoundly damaging detention can be\u201d and called on the new Labour government to \u201crebuild a just asylum system that respects human dignity and the rule of law\u201d.\nMitie faced challenges including staff shortages, the report said.\nA \u201cshambolic retendering process\u201d led by the Home Office meant leaders had \u201cno idea whether they would still be running the centre in the next few months\u201d, according to the findings.\nThe contractual uncertainties had been a problem since last year, which made it \u201call but impossible to recruit permanent senior staff, who might only be in post for a matter of weeks\u201d, the watchdog said.\nMitie said the company acknowledged the conditions and standard of care \u201cfell below the level we would expect at this facility\u201d when the inspection took place.\nIt said occupancy rates had been affected by the closure of some areas for refurbishment, adding: \u201cThis work is scheduled to be completed in August, following which a second wing (the conditions of which were particularly criticised by the inspection) will itself be closed for refurbishment.\u201d\nMitie added the population demographic at the centre had changed and more than half of the residents now arrived from police custody or prisons, leading to an increase in disruptive behaviours and incidents.\nHowever, the company said a \"new staffing model\" had led to \"a material improvement\" in staff engagement and retention.\nA spokesperson for Yvette Cooper, Labour's new home secretary, said Mr Cleverly's failure to respond was \"a sign of the staggering incompetence\" by the Conservative government.\nThey said: \"This is just another example of the Tories not taking the running of the country seriously enough. \n\"This Labour government is returning politics to public service.\u201d\nAn earlier Home Office statement said the number of custody officers and welfare staff at Harmondsworth had increased since the inspection.\nThe Conservative Party has been asked to comment.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on S",
    "Concerns have been raised that not enough has been done to address safety issues in the 15 years since a fire killed six people in a blaze at a south-east London block of flats.\nThree children were among those who died in the fire at the 14-story Lakanal House tower block on the Sceaux Estate  in Camberwell on 3 July 2009.\nLord Hendy, who represented the victims' families and survivours at an inquest into the deaths, said that seven years on from the Grenfell fire \"people are living in high-fire risk premises\".\nThe London Fire Brigade (LFB) said it had implemented all recommendations from phase one of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, which examined their response to the blaze.\nThe victims of the Lakanal House fire were Dayana Francisquini, 26, and her children, six-year-old Thais and Felipe, three; Helen Udoaka, 34, and her three-week-old daughter Michelle; and 31-year-old Catherine Hickman.\nMs Hickman, a fashion designer, called 999 and was told to wait in the building.  She was on the call for 40 minutes before she collapsed while still on the phone to the operator.\nMs Francisquini was at home with her two children. They died together in the same flat as Ms Udoaka and her newborn daughter.\nAll six all died on the 11th floor.\nMs Udoaka's father died of a heart attack the night he heard the news.\nThe fire started in a maisonette on the ninth floor following an electrical fault with a TV and spread quickly.\nA 2013 inquest into the deaths found cladding installed on the exterior of the building, as part of work commissioned by Southwark Council, had accelerated the fire.\nIan Wingfield, a Labour councillor for the ward covering the Sceaux Estate, told BBC London he had \"vivid memories\" of the night of the fire.\n\"I remember the dark thick black smoke that was billowing out the side of the corridor vents at the top of the building and the plastic that was dripping down,\" he said.\n\"The smell was something that I never want to smell again for the rest of my life.\"\nFollowing the 50-day inquest, the coroner Judge Frances Kirkham recorded a narrative verdict and made various recommendations to Southwark Council, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the LFB in the hope of preventing similar tragedies.\nAmong the recommendations was to retrofit sprinklers in high-rise buildings, review the \"stay-put\" policy and to review building regulations on combustible materials.\nBut the coroner could not legally compel public bodies to adopt the changes.\nSpeaking following the inquest's conclusion in March 2013, Mbet Udoaka, who lost his wife and baby, said: \"Nearly four years later and after a long inquest, no authority, organisation or body has said sorry to us or accepted the blame. \n\"We fear very much that lessons have not been learned.\"\nNearly eight years after the Lakanal fire, 72 people died in the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017.\nThe Grenfell Tower Inquiry will publish its final report in September.\n\u201cIt was highly emotional [and] they were wonderful people full of patience and understanding,\u201d Lord Hendy said.\n\"The only thing they can get out of the loss they suffered is the belief it will not happen again - or at least measures [are put in place] to reduce the risk of it happening again.\"\nHe said many of the inquest's recommendations had not been implemented.\nLord Hendy expressed hope that the next government would not ignore the recommendations from the Grenfell Inquiry.\nHe now sits as a Labour peer in the House of Lords and is a member of the all party parliamentary group for fire safety and rescue.\nMr Wingfield said the lack of an independent inquiry at the time was a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d.\n\"We can\u2019t see any more Lakanals and Grenfell towers in the future,\" he said.\nSouthwark Council pleaded guilty to charges relating to safety breaches in February 2017 and was ordered to pay \u00a3300,000 in costs.\nDespite Lakanal House being modernised, brought up to modern standards and now occupied with residents once again, fire safety remains a major concern on the estate, according to Mike Edge, the chair of the Sceaux Gardens Estate Tenants and Residents Association.\nMr Edge said improvements were made to Marie Curie House, an identical block to Lakanal House, following the fire, but they did not meet the higher standards introduced in the years after the Grenfell tower fire.\nHe added that residents had been living in an \"unsafe\" building for 10 years.\nOver the past few years, Marie Curie tenants and leaseholders have been moved out so it can be refurbished.\n\"I don't think we have moved on,\u201d he added. \nHe said they have had a waking watch for almost three years and still had several households living in the Marie Curie block looking to be rehoused.\nA waking watch is where specially trained people patrol all floors and the outside of a building to check for fires.\nA Southwark Council spokesperson said it was exploring \"all the options for this site, for residents now and in the future\".\nThey said only eight residents rema",

    "A man has been found guilty of murder after he stabbed a 74-year-old woman he had never met as she walked through a park. \nCameron Davis, 31, had denied murdering Lorna England but had pleaded guilty to manslaughter due to diminished responsibility.\nMrs England had been walking home from the supermarket when she was stabbed in the neck and chest by Davis at Ludwell Valley Park in Exeter, in the afternoon of 18 February 2023.\nMrs Justice Stacey told Exeter Crown Court it was a \"brutal killing of a member of the public by a total stranger\".\nDuring the trial the jury heard Mrs England had left her home and walked across the park to buy flour in Lidl.\nThey were shown CCTV footage of her walking back across the park before she was stabbed twice in a wooded area by Davis with a kitchen knife.\nGiving evidence during his trial, Davis, of Exeter Road in Exmouth, blamed failures in his care for the killing.\nAt a previous hearing, Joanna Martin KC, prosecuting, said Davis stabbed Mrs England to death because he was \u201cangry and upset\u201d rather than affected by a mental illness to a level that his responsibility was diminished.\nMs Martin said Davis called police at 04:41 GMT on the morning of 18 February \u2013 the day he attacked Mrs England \u2013 and threatened to take his own life in a fire at his accommodation unless he was arrested.\nParamedics attended the property, where they found Davis sitting on the pavement outside.\n\u201cHe said he was going to kill someone if he was discharged that day,\u201d Ms Martin told the court.\n\u201cHe said he had committed other crimes in the past and always got away with it. He repeated that if he was discharged, he would kill a random person.\u201d\nDavis was taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, where he was told that if he did anything it would be a pre-meditated crime.\nTwo psychiatrists discussed whether to section Davis and decided that he did not need to be admitted to hospital.\nHe later bought vodka and a knife at a Lidl supermarket and went to Ludwell Valley Park, where he fatally attacked Mrs England and took her mobile phone.\nAfter leaving the park, Davis went to shops and two pubs in Exeter before being spotted on CCTV sitting on the pavement in the city centre at 21:30.\nIn a statement released through Devon and Cornwall Police after the verdict, Mrs England's family said they were \"devastated by the brutal murder of our much-loved Lorna\".\nThey said: \u201cWe have been tormented by the violence, pain and suffering inflicted by Cameron Davis on Lorna from such a mindless and brutal knife attack.\n\u201cWe will never be able to come to terms with losing Lorna in this truly horrific and evil way.\n\u201cEvery day we are tortured and tormented as we constantly relive in our heads what Lorna endured prior and during the attack, what she had to go through, what she saw, heard and experienced that day.\u201d\nThe family continued: \u201cLife without Lorna is lonely and empty.\n\u201cThe family home misses her presence, her love, her laughter and her voice.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a massive void in our lives now, which has changed forever.

    "Nottingham Forest look set to stay at the City Ground after Nottingham City Council agreed to sell the stadium\u2019s land to the club, ending months of stalemate on its future.\nThe new land deal includes conditions to ensure the club stays at the stadium \u201cfor a long time to come\u201d, the council says.\nIt has been agreed by the two parties but not yet officially signed.\nThe ground, on the banks of the River Trent, sits on land owned by the council, which is leased to the club on a long-term agreement.\nThe current lease has 33 years to run but talks on a new lease between the club and the council broke down earlier this year, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nA fresh agreement is seen as critical for the club\u2019s existing plans to redevelop the stadium, which would expand its capacity from 29,000 to 40,000 through the rebuilding of the Peter Taylor Stand and extension of the Bridgford Stand.\nNegotiations collapsed after the council asked for a larger sum for the lease following Forest's promotion to the Premier League.\nThe authority was looking to increase rent from \u00a3250,000 to about \u00a31m per year.\nAlternatively, it offered to sell the freehold to the site to the club.\nTalks between the council and the club had since been at an impasse, leading Forest to say they were considering a potential move to Toton in Nottinghamshire to create a new 50,000-capacity stadium.\nHowever, on Monday, Neghat Khan, the new leader of the council, said a deal to sell the land to the club outright had been agreed in principle.\nIt will be subject to approval by the council's executive board at a meeting held in public on 16 July, meaning reports on the deal will be made public in the coming days.\n\"I'm pleased to announce we have agreed in principle\u00a0the sale of the City Ground to Nottingham Forest, all subject to the exec board approval next Tuesday,\u201d Ms Khan said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great deal for Forest supporters, for the club and also Nottingham taxpayers. It now means we can focus our resources on tackling other issues we have. But this is a great news story.\u201d\nHugh Casswell, BBC Nottingham political reporter\nThe relationship between council and club has been pretty frosty at times.\nAfter negotiations over rent reached an impasse earlier this year, they spent months without talking to one another at all.\nWhen Neghat Khan took over as leader she told me one of her first acts would be to \u201creach out\u201d to the owner and chairman.\nJust seven weeks later and it looks like a solution has been found.\nIt isn\u2019t quite a done deal yet, but no-one at the council is expecting anything to go wrong.\nOver to Forest.\nForest first announced plans to expand the stadium, the club\u2019s home since 1898, back in 2019.\nHowever, a new land deal ultimately did not progress because the city council decided the amount did not meet its obligation to ensure it was getting best value for taxpayers\u2019 money.\nThe council then declared effective bankruptcy in November last year amid a multimillion-pound budget deficit, and government commissioners were appointed in February to oversee critical improvements over how the council operates.\nCommissioners will now be ensuring the council achieves the best value in all areas of its operations.\nThe sale of the City Ground land freehold has been approved by the commissioners, and has undergone independent valuation.\nThe exact sale price of the land is not being disclosed, however, the authority says it will bring in a \u201csignificant capital receipt\u201d.\nNottingham Forest said: \"For absolutely clarity, we continue to work on the terms for a conditional deal for the purchase of the freehold. \n\"Any decision to purchase the freehold will be entirely conditional on Nottingham Forest first being granted the relevant permissions that will allow us to realise our hugely ambitious plans for a significantly larger stadium capacity, world-class hospitality spaces and associated substantial real estate development in the vicinity of the ground.\n\"Our discussions remain confidential and the club will update fans when meaningful progress has been achieved.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "\u201cI was planning to go and find a war or something when I finished my course. And in a way the war was on my doorstep.\u201d\nThe \u201cwar\u201d referred to by photographer Roger Tiley is the 1984-85 miners\u2019 strike that began a few short months before he was due to finish his degree in Newport, and which altered the course of his emerging professional life.\nIt saw him roam the south Wales valleys, showing the mining community he had grown up in as it battled for its very existence, sending his photographs off to newspapers in London.\nThe year-long strike ended in defeat for the miners, and was followed by the rapid closure of the pits that had formed the backdrop to Roger\u2019s life.\nNow he has retraced his steps across the coalfield from the south-east Wales valleys where he grew up to his present home in the Swansea valley, to raise money for the Alzheimer\u2019s Society and look at the transformation of the landscape in the intervening decades.\nAs a local boy, Roger had already spent some time taking pictures in the collieries in the year or so before the strike began, and this relationship allowed him access to communities which knew and trusted him.\n\u201cI\u2019m originally from Cross Keys in the Gwent valleys and some of my friends went to work in the collieries,\u201d he said.\n\u201cJobs didn\u2019t seem to be much of a problem in the 1970s. If you wanted to work, you could get a job in a factory, in the steel industry or in the collieries. Within 10 or 15 miles of me there were quite a few collieries still working, around about eight.\n\u201cThe miners\u2019 strike was very hard but I think I look back on it with fond memories in the fact that people were so good to me and so helpful.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a time that was desperate for a lot of mining families up in the valleys and I think what they were fighting for I believed in.\n\u201cI was very careful of where I turned the camera because I didn\u2019t want anybody using the pictures in the way that I didn\u2019t intend them to be used.\u201d\nIn between taking photographs, Roger also got involved with helping support the miners and distributing food parcels, which he \u201creally loved. I\u2019m proud I had the opportunity to do that.\u201d\nOne of the sites that holds particular resonance for him is Celynen South colliery near Abercarn in the Ebbw valley, where he first documented the working life of a colliery.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I started taking pictures. I wrote to the manager and he said I could come up,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThere\u2019s two miners waiting to go underground and there\u2019s a pithead wheel in the background and it\u2019s a very graphic picture.

It was very sad. In those days they didn\u2019t fence things off. They just demolished the pit and you could just walk on to it, which I did.\n\u201cSome of the buildings were demolished, the pithead wheel was there but some of the ropes they used for the cage had gone. It just looked really sad.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a housing estate on the colliery site now. There isn\u2019t anything really to mark that there was a pit there.\n\u201cIn a way I suppose that\u2019s positive; it isn\u2019t wasteland any more. It was for a good few years, but now at least there\u2019s houses on there providing homes for people.\u201d\nThe changes to the landscape vary widely across the former coalfields.\n\u201cSome have factory units on them, half-empty I would say. Mardy [colliery in Maerdy, Rhondda Cynon Taf] is one place where you could walk up there and unless you knew there was a colliery, you wouldn\u2019t [be able to tell].\n\u201cThere\u2019s some concrete bases there from the buildings and there\u2019s some tiles from the pit canteen that are still there, but youngsters wouldn\u2019t really know that.\u201d\nOther places like Penrhiwceiber in the Cynon valley have become playing fields.\nWhile he acknowledges the good in reusing sites, Roger laments the loss of so many jobs and the community they engendered.\n\u201cEach pit would have employed in the region of 1,000-plus men. If you multiply that by 30, 31 pits still working at the time of the strike, that\u2019s a lot of men, and all the industries around it, suppliers etc.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re probably looking at 40,000-50,000 people employed in the south Wales coalfield, and that\u2019s all gone.\u201d\nRay Lawrence, NUM lodge secretary at Celynen South for 14 years, worked as an electrician for 25 years in the mine and joined Roger as he reached the pit on his six-day walk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine it now,\" said Ray. \"I\u2019m looking around and it\u2019s so peaceful. But 40 years ago there was a dirty great big hole in the ground there and every morning 500 or 600 men would disappear down there.\n\u201cThe place was vibrant.

    "The US government has blocked a British court hearing from taking place on a British territory, citing security concerns, according to official documents.\nThe supreme court of British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot) was due to hold a hearing this week, attended by the BBC, on whether a group of migrants was being unlawfully detained on the island of Diego Garcia.\nThe island hosts a secretive UK-US military base and access is heavily restricted.\nThe US last week said it was \u201cwithdrawing its consent\u201d for lawyers representing the migrants and \u201cmembers of the press\u201d - the BBC - to access the island, according to official communications we have seen.\nIt said it would not allow participants of the hearing to board US military flights to Diego Garcia and would not provide \u201chousing, transportation, and food for the visit\u201d.\nThe US said it would be \u201cwilling to reconsider\u201d if the visit was \u201cconducted in a manner\u201d that addressed its \u201csecurity and operational concerns\u201d.\nDozens of migrants arrived on the island in October 2021, saying they had been fleeing persecution and trying to sail to Canada to claim asylum when their boat ran into trouble near Diego Garcia.\nLate last Thursday night - hours before the judge, UK government lawyers and those representing the migrants, and the BBC were due to board flights for the first leg of the journey - the court shared an order cancelling the hearing.\nThe US security concerns relate to a site visit that had been scheduled to take place on the island as part of the hearing, which was to include the migrant camp and several other areas of Diego Garcia.\nIn a communication on 3 July, entitled \u201cUnited States Notification to the United Kingdom of denial of the 6-12 July 2024 visit by of [sic] the Biot Supreme Court to Diego Garcia\u201d, US authorities said the site visit presented \u201crisks to the security and effective operation\u201d of the base. \nIt had previously said it was willing to allow access to areas including the migrant camp, beaches around it and a chapel where children receive schooling. \nBut it had said it would not provide access to areas \u201copen to civilian contractors and other non-military personnel\u201d, such as a movie theatre, a barber and a bowling centre, the airport terminal and \u201call US-controlled areas occupied by the Biot administration, the Royal Overseas Police, and the Royal Navy\u201d.\nCourt documents filed on behalf of Biot\u2019s commissioner state that the reasons for the island's US military commander's decision were \u201cconfidential and based on the US\u2019s assessment of its own national security needs\u201d.\nTom Short, a lawyer from the UK firm Leigh Day which is representing some of the migrants, said the cancellation of this week\u2019s hearing had been \u201ca devastating blow to our vulnerable clients\u201d, and called for it to be rearranged as soon as possible.\n\u201cOur clients have ceded to US demands that the site visit exclude certain US-controlled buildings (such as the gym and swimming pool where US cheerleaders and celebrity chefs visited earlier this year) as well as facilities such as the Turner Club and Golf Club (which Biot and FCDO civil servants frequent). \n\u201cIt is of paramount importance to our clients that the Judge see the detention camp and that they attend a hearing in person,\u201d he added.\nA virtual court hearing on Tuesday, attended by lawyers in London and the migrants in Diego Garcia, sought to determine the next steps in the case as discussions between the UK and US governments continue.\nSpeaking after the hearing, migrants told the BBC of their disappointment at this week\u2019s hearing being cancelled.\n\u201cIt has taken away all our hope,\u201d one woman said. \u201cWe have been stuck in this place for almost three years. We were hoping that this hearing would provide us some relief.\u201d\nThe UK took control of the Chagos Islands, of which Diego Garcia is part, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965. It went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the military base.\nAgreements signed in 1966 allowed for an initial 50-year period of US use of the territory, plus a further 20 years. The agreement was then \u201crolled over\u201d in 2016, and is now set to expire in 2036, according to the Biot website.\nBiot is administered from London but is described as being \"constitutionally distinct\u201d from the UK.\nMauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, maintains that the islands are its own and the United Nations' highest court has ruled that the UK's administration of the territory is \"unlawful\" and must end.\nMost personnel and resources on Diego Garcia are under the control of the US, including the majority of the accommodation and transport on the island as well as restaurants and shops.\nThe US military commander can refuse access to areas operated or controlled by the US military for security reasons.\nIn a witness statement, Biot\u2019s deputy commissioner, Nishi Dholakia, said it was not possible to \u201cmake alternative arrangements to replace the logistical support which the US was due t",

    "Almost 1.8 million people are now in at least \u00a350,000 of UK student debt, data obtained by BBC News reveals.\nMore than 61,000 have balances of above \u00a3100,000, figures from the Student Loans Company (SLC) also show, while another 50 people each owe upwards of \u00a3200,000.\nThe statistics were released after a Freedom of Information (FOI) request for the number of loan holders with above average debts who are eligible to start repayments.\nThe SLC previously said the average balance for loan holders in England when they start making repayments was less than \u00a345,000. New government data shows that amount has now risen to \u00a348,470.\nBalances can be significantly higher for those who study multiple or lengthy courses and often rise rapidly with interest.\nIn 2023/24, some 2.8 million people in England made a student loan repayment, according to government figures released after the FOI response.\nThat means only a small fraction of those repaying their balances are in more than \u00a3100,000 of debt - but the majority do owe more than \u00a350,000.\nIt comes after the BBC revealed earlier this year that the highest UK student debt was more than \u00a3231,000. Around three months later, that figure has now hit \u00a3252,000.\nTom Allingham, from website Save The Student, said such balances were \"alarming\" but were \u201cin no way indicative of the norm\u201d.\nPersonal finance expert Martin Lewis told the BBC the debts should be seen more like a \"limited form of graduate tax\".\nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, he explained: \"Student finance for the vast majority of students is not about what you owe, but what you earn - you repay 9% of everything above a threshold.\"\nFor example, those on \"Plan 2 loans\" would pay 9% of everything earned over \u00a327,295.\nThe National Union of Students (NUS) branded it \u201cridiculous\u201d that none of the main parties are offering \"reform\" of student finance in the election campaign.\nDebts are written off at the end of loan terms, regardless of how much is owed by that point. The terms are often 30 or 40 years, but depend on your course and start date.\nHeavily-indebted graduates have also spoken to BBC News about their concerns with the current system.\nTiti, a senior electrical engineer from Croydon who asked for his full name not to be used, saw his student debt - which stands at more than \u00a3128,200 - rise by \u00a3788.11 between 6 April and 6 June this year.\n\u201cNo matter how much I pay it is always increasing,\u201d he said, referencing the near 8% interest rate on accounts like his, which is driven by high inflation.\nThe father-of-one, 43, told the BBC he feels it is impossible to pay back the balance in full following his four-year course at London South Bank University and two years studying for a Higher National Diploma.\n\u201cIt seems like a money-making avenue when you look at the (interest) rates applied to the loans,\u201d he said.\nTiti said he fears some people may be discouraged from higher education \u201cwhen they do the calculations\u201d and consider what they could earn without a degree.\nIt is more than 10 years since tuition fees were tripled in England. From 2017, fees have cost a maximum of \u00a39,250 per year across the UK, though in Scotland, Scottish students are charged a maximum of \u00a31,820 and in Northern Ireland, the current maximum tuition fee for full-time undergraduates is \u00a34,710.\nMany people who borrowed \"exceptional amounts\" on so-called \"Plan 2\" loans - which were introduced when fees were tripled - are unlikely to pay the full amount back, according to Ben Waltmann, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \nBut Claire Callender, a professor of higher education policy and deputy director of the Centre for Global Higher Education, told the BBC that owing such high amounts is \"likely to have a negative impact on graduates' lives\".\nIt is not clear whether the largest debt now known to the SLC - of \u00a3252,000 - is on the same loan as the one revealed to be the highest in March, at \u00a3231,000. \nNick Hillman, the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, told the BBC he was \"most shocked\" by the number of people in more than \u00a3200,000 of student debt.\nHe pointed out that the data suggests that fewer than 50 people owe at least \u00a310m between them.\n\"Clearly, at that level, the student loan system is not working well because these people will not pay it all back\", Mr Hillman said.\nIn its response to the FOI request, the SLC said people with higher than average balances \"may be in receipt of several student loan products\", including an Advanced Learner Loan for further education courses and funding for undergraduate courses, postgraduate Master\u2019s courses and postgraduate Doctoral courses. \nIt said other factors behind high student debts could also include loan holders studying multiple or lengthier courses or holding more than one loan plan type. The company added that some students receive additional funding due to \"compelling personal reasons\".\nDespite being in more than \u00a3101,500 of debt, foundation year 2 doctor Abbie Tutt is pleased the sy",

    "A top state secondary school and sixth form is set to begin drug testing students as part of a new safeguarding policy.\nWymondham College in Norfolk said it wanted to meet the \"growing national concern\u201d of young people being exposed to illegal drugs.\nIn a letter to parents, seen by the BBC, it said students would be asked to provide a urine sample if there was \"reasonable suspicion of drug or substance abuse\".\nIt advised parents to discuss the new policy with their children and said information assemblies would be held at school.\nThe new policy, published on the school's website, said urine samples would be handed to the school nurse for testing, and the student's \"dignity and personal privacy\" would be respected during the process.\nIt said: \"A refusal by a pupil to undergo a test, without good reason, will be deemed as an admission of guilt and will be dealt with as if a test was returned positive.\"\nStudents faced being suspended or permanently excluded if caught dealing or using drugs, or failing to provide a test without good reason.\nChildren aged under 16 could be asked to provide a test providing they are of \"sufficient maturity and that they fully understand the situation\".\nThe letter, signed by vice principals Julie Marsh and Dale McMorran, said the school was \"aligning its response with other schools nationally\".\n\"This policy is important for the maintenance of good order and discipline within the community and will support our students to make safe, healthy and responsible decisions about drugs, both legal and illegal,\" it said.\n\"By working together, we can help young people to navigate their way through what is a complex social issue and safeguard everyone within the community.\"\nA spokesperson for Wymondham College said: \"We have reviewed our policies and are introducing something that is common practice across boarding schools nationally. \n\"Having been judged by Ofsted as 'outstanding' for boarding and education this academic year, we constantly review our policies and procedures. This move has been welcomed by our parents, pupils and staff.\"\nAn NHS report, published in 2022, suggested 18% of secondary school students in England had taken drugs, compared with 24% in 2018.\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) recommends that drug testing and sniffer dogs should not be used in schools where there is no evidence of drugs on school premises.\nIts advice says schools \"may choose to make use of drug dogs or drug testing strategies if they wish\" and that it is advisable to consult the local police.\nWymondham College's new policy is expected to be introduced on 1 September.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A politician in South Korea is being criticised for making dangerous and unsubstantiated comments after linking a rise in male suicides to the increasingly \u201cdominant\u201d role of women in society.\nIn a report, Seoul City councillor Kim Ki-duck argued women\u2019s increased participation in the workforce over the years had made it harder for men to get jobs and to find women who wanted to marry them.\nHe said the country had recently \u201cbegun to change into a female-dominant society\u201d and that this might \"partly be responsible for an increase in male suicide attempts\u201d.\nSouth Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among the world\u2019s rich countries but also has one of the worst records on gender equality.\nCouncillor Kim\u2019s comments have been criticised as the latest in a series of out-of-touch remarks made by male politicians.\nCouncillor Kim, from the Democratic Party, arrived at his assessment when analysing data on the number of suicide attempts made at bridges along Seoul\u2019s Han river.\nThe report, published on the city council\u2019s official website, showed that the number of suicide attempts along the river had risen from 430 in 2018 to 1,035 in 2023, and of those trying to take their lives the proportion who were men had climbed from 67% to 77%.\nSuicide prevention experts have expressed concern over Mr Kim\u2019s report.\n\u201cIt is dangerous and unwise to make claims like this without sufficient evidence,\u201d Song In Han, a mental health professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University, told the BBC.\nHe pointed out that globally more men took their lives than women. In many countries, including the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50.\nEven so, Prof Song said the reasons behind the sharp rise in men attempting suicide in Seoul needed to be scientifically studied, adding it was \u201cvery regrettable\u201d that the councillor had made it about gender conflict.\n\nIn South Korea there is a substantial gulf between the number of men and women in full-time employment, with women disproportionately working temporary or part-time jobs. The gender pay gap is slowly narrowing, but still women are paid on average 29% less than men.\nIn recent years an anti-feminist movement has surged, led by disillusioned young men, who argue they have been disadvantaged by attempts to improve women\u2019s lives.\nAppearing to echo such views, Councillor Kim\u2019s report concluded that the way to overcome \u201cthe female-domination phenomenon\u201d was to improve people\u2019s awareness of gender equality so that \u201cmen and women can enjoy equal opportunities\u201d.\nKoreans took to the social media platform X to denounce the councillor\u2019s remarks as \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and \u201cmisogynistic\u201d, with one user questioning whether they were living in a parallel universe.\nThe Justice Party accused the councillor of \u201ceasily shifting the blame to women in Korean society who are struggling to escape gender discrimination\". It has called on him to retract his remarks and instead \u201cproperly analyse\u201d the causes of the problem.\nWhen approached for comment by the BBC, Councillor Kim said he had \u201cnot intended to be critical of the female-dominated society\u201d, and was merely giving his personal view about some of its consequences.\nHowever, his comments follow a number of unscientific and sometimes bizarre political proposals aimed at tackling some of South Korea\u2019s most pressing social issues, including mental illness, gender violence and the lowest birth rate in the world.\nLast month, another Seoul councillor in his 60s published a series of articles on the authority\u2019s website encouraging young women to take up gymnastics and practise pelvic floor exercises in order to raise the birth rate.\nAt the same time, a government think tank recommended that girls start school earlier than boys, so that classmates would be more attracted to each other by the time they were ready to marry.\n\u201cSuch comments encapsulate just how pervasive misogyny is in South Korea,\u201d said Yuri Kim, director of the Korean Women's Trade Union. She accused politicians and policymakers of not even trying to understand the challenges women faced, preferring to scapegoat them instead.\n\u201cBlaming women for entering the workforce will only prolong the imbalances in our society,\u201d she told the BBC.\nCurrently women account for 20% of South Korea\u2019s members of parliament, and 29% of all local councillors.\nSeoul City Council told the BBC there was no process in place to vet what politicians published on its official website unless the content was illegal. It said individuals were solely responsible for their content and would face any consequences at the next election.\nAdditional reporting by Hosu Lee and Leehyun Choi\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by issues in this article, the following resources may help:\nIn the UK: BBC Action Line\nElsewhere in the world: Befrienders Worldwide",

    "A new species of dinosaur unearthed on the Isle of Wight has been named in honour of the man who found it, following his death.\nThe 125 million-year-old specimen was found in Compton Bay on the Isle of Wight in 2013 by fossil hunter Nick Chase, who died of cancer in 2019.\nPhD student Jeremy Lockwood determined the skeleton was a new genus and species, naming it Comptonatus chasei in a tribute to Mr Chase.\nMr Chase's son, Will, who was present at the excavation in 2013, described his father as \"a wonderful man and a treasure for the island\".\nThe fossilised bones are the most complete dinosaur discovered in the UK in the last century and are described in a new scientific paper.\nDr Lockwood, a retired GP, now studying at the University of Portsmouth, helped with the dinosaur\u2019s excavation and spent years analysing its 149 different bones.\nHe said: \"Nick had a phenomenal nose for finding dinosaur bones - he really was a modern-day Mary Anning. \n\"He collected fossils daily in all weathers and donated them to museums. \n\"I was hoping we'd spend our dotage collecting together as we were of similar ages, but sadly that wasn't to be the case.\"\nDr Lockwood said, despite Mr Chase's numerous discoveries - including the most complete Iguanodon skull found in Britain - this was the first dinosaur to be named after him.\nWill Chase accompanied his father on numerous fossil hunting trips as a child, including the excavation of the Compton bones, which are now on display in the Dinosaur Isle Museum in Sandown.\nHe said: \"From the age of four or five, Dad used to bring me on digs. I wasn\u2019t exactly very helpful but I have such good memories of him from then.\n\"In 2013 - it was a lovely day in August - I turned up and I was digging some of the feet out, or the claws, and a piece snapped in half. I think he glued it together in the end.\n\"I grew up on this beach and I am so thankful for the time I spent with him down here.\"\nMr Chase's sister, Sarah, said her brother had always been obsessed with archaeology and palaeontology when they were growing up.\n\"Every house we lived in, the back garden would be dug up to a great depth,\" she said.\n\"He found stuff wherever he went.\n\"You could walk down any beach with Nick and he would come back with an arm full of finds. He just had the eye for it.\"\nShe said he unearthed the Iguanodon skull at Brook Bay after spotting a \"minute\" rib bone poking from the cliff.\n\"Nobody would take any notice of it but Nick said, 'there\u2019s a dinosaur in there', and he was right - there was. \n\"It was a very important find. It had the most complete skull of any Iguanodon and over the following weeks and month he and various friends dug it out.\"\nMs Chase described her brother as \"very generous\", often giving bones he found to children on the beach or helping them identify their finds.\nShe said: \"He didn\u2019t make any money from it.\n\"All his scientifically important finds he gave to scientific institutions. He felt strongly that these things should be shared with everyone.\"\nThe newly described dinosaur is thought to have weighed about a ton (900kg) and was the size of a large male American bison. \nPhD supervisor and senior author of the paper, Dr Susannah Maidment, said Dr Lockwood's research \"continues to reveal that the diversity of dinosaurs in southern England in the early Cretaceous [period] was much greater than previously realised\".\nThe paper has been published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology.\nFollow BBC South on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Twitter, or\u00a0Instagram.

    "Members of an Australian religious group have gone on trial accused of killing an eight-year-old diabetic girl by denying her medical care and offering prayer instead.\nElizabeth Struhs was found dead at a home in Toowoomba - about 125km (78 mi) west of Brisbane - in January 2022, after she had allegedly gone without insulin for several days.\nProsecutors say the sect shunned the use of medicine and trusted God to \u201cheal\u201d the child - \u201cextreme beliefs\u201d which had already almost ended Elizabeth\u2019s life in similar circumstances three years before.\nThe girl's parents are among the 14 defendants, all of whom have refused lawyers. \nThey have also all opted to enter no pleas on the charges. Formally, the court considers that a plea of not guilty.\nTwo men - Elizabeth\u2019s father Jason Struhs, 52, and the religious group\u2019s leader Brendan Stevens, 62 - have been charged with murder, with prosecutors saying they knew the group's actions would likely kill Elizabeth.\nThe girl's mother, Kerrie Struhs, 49, brother Zachary Struhs, 21, and ten others - aged 22 to 67 - are accused of manslaughter.\nAs the trial began at the Queensland Supreme Court on Wednesday, the group filed in one by one, clad in prison clothes, taking their allocated positions in a courtroom specifically modified to fit them all.\nDue to the complexity and notoriety of the case, the trial is being heard by a judge only - no jury - and is expected to last for around three months.\nWhen opening her case, prosecutor Caroline Marco said Elizabeth had been an \"intelligent, spiritual child\".\n\"But [she was] too young to understand the dire consequences of her parents' decision... which she ultimately paid for with her own life.\u201d\nMs Marco alleged that in early January 2022, both parents made the decision to first reduce the amount of insulin given to their daughter, and then withdraw it completely.\nMembers of the sect then gathered at the home to pray, she said, and it was \u201cvisible to all who saw her\u201d that Elizabeth\u2019s health was in danger. But there was \u201cno attempt\u201d to get a doctor.\nShe later died after having \"suffered for days\" , said the prosecutor. \nThe court heard Mrs Struhs had only been out of prison for a few weeks, after being convicted of failing to provide insulin to her daughter on another occasion in 2019.\nThat time, the girl spent a month in hospital after medical treatment was eventually sought by her father.\nJason Struhs previously had not agreed with the group's beliefs, the judge was told, but had been baptised while his wife was in prison.\n\u201cHe knew if he did not change he would lose his family and wife so pushed aside convictions of faith he once held, and joined them,\" Ms Marco said.\nOver the course of the trial, the court would hear from 60 witnesses including one of the Struhs' daughters, who is estranged from the family, Ms Marco said.\nThe evidence, she added, would paint a picture of a small and \u201cinsular\u201d religious group which centred around Brendan Stevens.\nProsecutors will continue laying out their arguments on Thursday, after which the defendants will also have the opportunity to address the court.\nBefore the trial began, Justice Martin Burn said stressed that he was obliged to provide sufficient information to ensure they got a fair trial, but could not provide them with legal advice.",
    "The \"earthquake\" may have passed but the aftershocks are still being felt right across Northern Ireland's political landscape.\nIt was the most dramatic of outcomes to a most undramatic election campaign.\nNow the parties have started to look beneath the surface to understand why the plates moved and to assess if the new fault lines are permanent.\nBut they will be mindful about over-analysing the results when so many other factors came into play.\nFirstly, the turnout of 57% was the lowest in the history of Westminster elections.\nA July snap election - peak holiday period - was always going to drive the numbers down.\nOnly three constituencies had a turnout in the 60s while others struggled to get above 50%.\nBoundary changes also played a key role in shaping the final result as voters headed for new polling stations and a new list of candidates.\nWhile the Richter scale did jump on Thursday in some constituencies, the Westminster needle shows little over all change.\nThe nationalist vote increased from 40.1% to 40.4% while the unionist vote has dipped from 43.2% to 43.1%.\nThere is also no change on the green benches - with nine nationalist MPs, eight unionist MPs and one Alliance MP.\nBut there is the potential for greater change.\nSinn F\u00e9in is now the largest party at Westminster without breaking any sweat.\nThough it didn't add to its seven seats, it increased its vote to 27% despite not fielding candidates in four constituencies.\nIt also claimed 67% of the overall nationalist vote and in the process pushed the once marginal seats of North Belfast and Fermanagh South Tyrone beyond the reach of unionists.\nSinn F\u00e9in tightened its grip in South Down and recovered lost ground in Foyle, where the SDLP majority has been greatly reduced.\nBut most strikingly it is closing in on what were once considered safe DUP strongholds - like East Londonderry.\nKathleen McGurk came within 179 votes of taking the seat from Gregory Campbell - who had a majority of more than 9,000 votes - though more unionist candidates were in the race this time.\nExpect that to become a top target for Sinn F\u00e9in next time round and don't be surprised if the party adds another assembly seat at the expense of the SDLP.\nSinn F\u00e9in is already plotting its next moves while the DUP is in full crisis mode.\nLosing three of its eight seats was a crushing blow and will see the party returning to the green benches this week without a Paisley in its ranks for the first time in more than 50 years.\nHowever, the pain has been softened slightly by the removal of its most ardent opponent Jim Allister from the blue benches at Stormont.\nThough it was the most eye-catching result on the night, the DUP vote in North Antrim had been falling and the TUV was in the best position to strike.\nDespite what its opponents said, the TUV's presence on the ballot paper did not cost unionism a seat by splitting the vote.\nIn Lagan Valley, the TUV candidate polled less than Sorcha Eastwood\u2019s winning margin.\nBut the TUV did come within 179 votes of being accused of costing Gregory Campbell his seat in East Londonderry.\nJim Allister will now team up with the five Reform MPs at Westminster but he may struggle to be as effective as he was at Stormont.\nLosing Lagan Valley to a non-unionist for the first time in the constituency\u2019s 40-year history was just as painful for the DUP as losing North Antrim.\nSorcha Eastwood turned a 6,500 vote deficit into a 3,000 vote victory.\nHer popularity pulled in votes from the across the political spectrum as she cashed in on tactical voting from nationalists and increased support from unionist areas.\nMs Eastwood's brand of politics struck a chord while the DUP camp struggled to emerge from the shadow of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.\nThe circumstances of his shock departure from the party and appearance in court were the focus of almost every conversation on the door steps, according to DUP canvassers.\nThere was also no denying the sense of anger and frustration over the deal the party negotiated - and was accused of over-selling - to restore Stormont.\nAs a result, many DUP voters opted to stay at home or vote for other candidates.\nThis played well for the Ulster Unionists who, as expected, comfortably won back the seat in South Antrim.\nIt pitched its most high-profile candidate against the DUP's most low-profile outgoing MP and it paid off.\nTactical voters may have helped the Alliance party to snatch a DUP seat in Lagan Valley but they deserted the party in North Down.\nThose who helped Stephen Farry claim the seat when the Brexit battle was at its heights returned to their core political bases.\nThat cleared the way for Alex Easton to fulfil his lifelong ambition in becoming the latest in a long line of independent MPs in North Down.\nAlliance leader Naomi Long also lost out in a more crowded field as DUP leader Gavin Robinson stretched his lead over his long time challenger.\nThough defeated, Ms Long appeared relieved to be returning to her job as Justice Minister and no",
    "Sainsbury's has reported a slowdown in sales after the soggy spring weather hit trading at its Argos business.\nThe UK's second largest supermarket said it had seen strong food sales, but the wet weather hit demand for garden equipment and outdoor furniture at Argos.\nCost of living pressures also hit non-food sales, and Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts said he expected consumers to remain cautious until interest rates start to fall.\nOne analyst suggested the Argos business was an \"albatross\" around the supermarket's neck.\nSales overall were up 3% in the 16 weeks to 22 June, Sainsbury's said, but this was slower than in the previous quarter.\nFood sales rise 4.8%, with Nectar offers and Aldi price matching helping to attract shoppers.  \nSainsbury's also said its 'Taste the Difference' premium own brand range had seen sales jump by 14%.\nHowever, sales of non-food items were down and Argos saw sales drop 6.2%. Along with the wet weather, the retailer said cost-of-living pressures meant shoppers were still cautious about spending on big ticket items.\nArgos also saw weaker demand for consumer electronics, particularly in gaming.\nMr Roberts said it was not surprising that consumers were being cautious given the pressure on household finances and he did not expect this to change until there were \"sequential\" cuts in interest rates.\nHowever, he added that the weather was a key factor in how and when customers choose to spend. The recent spell of hot weather had triggered a spike in sales of items such as fans and paddling pools.\nSophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said \"the Argos albatross around its [Sainsbury's] neck can\u2019t be ignored\".\n\"Electronics aren\u2019t faring well in this economic climate, as people prioritise the essentials,\" Ms Lund-Yates said.\n\"General merchandise is the most cyclical area of the supermarket economy to be in, so being overweight in this arena really slows you down when times get tough.\n\"The additional exposure offsets and hides what has been a remarkable showing for the core grocery business.\"\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that Sainsbury\u2019s has \"the same nagging feeling as the England football team - it eventually scores a goal but you know it could do a lot better\".\n\u201cThe non-food operations have been letting the side down for a long time and causing unwelcome distractions for management when they could be doing even more to capitalise on the new-found strength in food.\"\nSeparately, research from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) found that cheaper coffee, butter and TVs all helped to slow shop price rises to the lowest annual rate for almost three years last month.\nPrices rose at an annual rate of 0.2% in June, the BRC said, with TVs being discounted ahead of the Euro 2024 tournament.\nInflation - the rate at which prices rise - has been falling steadily over the past year.\nHowever, even though inflation is falling, it does not mean the prices of goods and services overall are coming down, just that they are rising at a slower pace.\nWhile the BRC survey found shop price rises have slowed to the lowest rate since October 2021, many food items and other goods are still more expensive than they were before the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leaving household budgets squeezed.",

For the first 18 years of his life, Antetokounmpo could not travel outside Greece and was effectively stateless, having no papers either from Greece or Nigeria. He was eventually issued Greek citizenship in May 2013, less than two months before the NBA draft.\nAntetokounmpo spoke about his childhood in a recent interview with ESPN. \n\"I used to sell things since I can remember myself, since I was six or seven years old.\n\u201cI was always out of home trying as much as I could to help my mom and dad by selling watches, glasses, CDs, DVDs, and everything I could find. I was doing that until I turned 17 because I had to. I had no other choice. When I was selling all those things, I was the best seller.\"\nBut even after becoming a star in the US, Antetokounmpo encountered racism at home. \nIn a TNT documentary in 2020, he said: \"Greece is a country of white people, life can be difficult for someone with the colour of my skin. Or of another nationality. You go to a lot of neighbourhoods, and you face a lot of racism.\"\nThere was a backlash to his comments from some in Greece, including Konstantinos Kalemis, then-coordinator for refugee education in the Malakasa camp north of Athens, who used a range of racial slurs against Antetokounmpo and was fired as a result. \nHe has also faced discrimination from government officials.\nIn 2018, Adonis Georgiadis, the current health minister, repeatedly mispronounced his name and falsely claimed he had been born in Africa instead of Greece.\nAntetokounmpo will be one of the first athletes to open the Games, as Greece - the birthplace of the Olympics - traditionally leads the parade.\nSpyros Kapralos, president of the Greek Olympic Committee, said there was \"unanimity\" in the decision for Antetokounmpo to carry the flag in Paris.

    "A Lancashire GP whose patients launched a campaign to keep her as their doctor has been told by NHS bosses that she can remain at the helm of the surgery she has run for more than a decade.\nDr Ann Robinson had faced two-and-a-half years of uncertainty over her future at Withnell Health Centre near Chorley after other providers were invited to bid to take it over.\nShe said she was \"completely delighted\" to be able to continue leading the health centre on Railway Road.\nThe saga began following the dissolution of a previous partnership between Dr Robinson and another medic at the surgery in late 2021.\nUnder NHS rules, anybody can pitch for a practice's contract.\nThe outcome of that procurement exercise in January 2023 originally resulted in a decision to hand the centre over to a conglomerate that operates more than 40 practices across the north-west of England.\nThe decision was met with fury by patients, however, with more than 1,500 lodging objections with the Lancashire and South Cumbria Integrated Care Board (ICB).    \nThat depth of community feeling \u2013 along with acknowledged flaws in the NHS\u2019s initial public consultation exercise \u2013 saw the decision scrapped and the whole process was restarted.\nDr Robinson and her team had to put together a second bid to keep control of the practice and were advised on Thursday that it had been successful.\nShe said patients' support had shown the enduring importance and appreciation of \"the family doctor\u201d.\n\"That\u2019s what people want \u2013 and the continuity [it provides] is what works best. If I know your history and what has helped you in the past \u2013 and what hasn\u2019t \u2013 it is better for patient care.\n\"People feel so strongly about this place \u2013 some have been patients here for 50 years and they can tell you all the GPs that have looked after them.\"\n\nDr Robinson, who took charge of the practice in 2013, turned out to be the only bidder for the contract.\nShe put this down to the local campaign demonstrating the depth of support for the existing service.\nThe GP thanked not only those residents who rallied around the cause, but also loyal staff, whom she described as being \"amazing\".\nProfessor Craig Harris, chief operating officer of the Lancashire and South Cumbria ICB, acknowledged it had \"taken some time\" to reach a decision.\nBut he added: \"Our commitment has, at all times, been to ensure the process was carried out as quickly and fairly as possible to support the patients of the practice and the staff who work there \u2013 and I am confident this has been achieved.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The old adage that \"laughter is the best medicine\" has become the mantra of a yoga teacher who believes even fake chuckles could \"change your life\". \nClive St James, from Bath, is a laughter yoga leader, who discovered at a young age that doing comedy impersonations helped his mother's chronic depression.\nLaughter releases endorphins, known as \"feel-good hormones\" and reduces stress hormones, he said.\n\"It supercharges you. It's about having fun while you're exercising. Once you gain the basic skills, you can change someone's life,\" said Mr St James.\n\"Of course, it's yoga, so we do all the stretching exercises.\n\"We know that's good for you and makes us stronger, more flexible but we also want to become advanced breathers.\n\"We only laugh on the out breath, so this is a good way of getting rid of all the stale air at the bottom of your lungs,\" he told BBC Bristol\nThough laughing therapy has been used for decades, laughing yoga was started by Dr Madan Kataria, a doctor in Mumbai, India, in 1995. \nAfter a number of trials, he discovered that our brains are unable to tell the difference between fake or real laughs.\n\"The brain doesn't know the difference between laughing for real, or pretend laughing,\" said Mr St James.\n\"If someone tells you a joke, you have to decide if it's funny, or if you've heard it before, or if it's going to upset you. \n\"But if you laugh for no reason, you still get your daily dose of those lovely endorphins,\" he added.\nIn 2023, a study presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress and endorsed by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), found that laughter therapy led to improvements in the heart and circulation.\nThere are now more than 5,000 laughter yoga clubs worldwide. According to the BHF, some doctors in Bristol offer laughter yoga to help improve their patients' wellbeing.\nMr St James has first-hand experience of the beneficial power of laughter, after he started doing impersonations of the late comedian, Tommy Cooper, as a child to help with his mother's chronic depression. \n\"I would put a flower pot on my head - Tommy Cooper habitually wore a red fez when performing - and that made her smile. \n\"It would take her out of this dark space,\" he said.\nMr St James was also crowned the Guinness World Record's fastest comedian for the last eight years. This involves getting audiences to laugh within moments of the comedian arriving on stage.  \nHe now runs regular laughter yoga workshops with his wife, Jackie. \nTheir free classes take place on Mondays at 18:30 BST in Sydney Gardens.\nA special session on 15 July will pit participants from Bath against those from Bristol.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Former veterans' minister Johnny Mercer is facing a potential prison sentence after his application to withhold the names of those who told him about alleged war crimes was rejected by a public inquiry. \nMr Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, repeatedly refused to hand over the names of \"multiple officers\" who told him about alleged special forces murders in Afghanistan while giving evidence in February.\nHe told the inquiry at the time: \"The one thing you can hold on to is your integrity and I will be doing that with these individuals.\"\nSir Charles Haddon-Cave said in his ruling: \"Integrity requires moral courage to do what is right, even when it may not be popular.\"\nIn a previous order, the inquiry's chairman said the consequences of failing to comply without a reasonable excuse would be \"a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment and/or a fine\".\nMr Mercer then submitted an application to the inquiry on 3 April, in which he said he was unable to comply with the order and it was not reasonable for him to comply with it.\nHe later accused the Independent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan of \"ignoring pretty serious evidence\" in order to \"fixate\" on pressuring him to hand over the names.\nIn his ruling, Sir Charles said Mr Mercer told the inquiry he was a \"protector of whistleblowers\".\n\"He chose publicly, however, to disclose that friends told him about allegations of unlawful killings by (special forces) in Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\"He has since refused to disclose the names to assist the inquiry, even though: the inquiry was set up for the very purpose of looking into these allegations; he says that that his friends were merely witnesses; he could pass on their names to the inquiry privately and in strict confidence; he accepts that the inquiry protects the identities of confidential contacts; and they have protection from risk of prosecution for breach of the Official Secrets Act or failure to report misconduct.\"\nAn inquiry spokeswoman added: \"Mr Mercer is refusing to disclose information which may be important to a public inquiry which is seeking to establish the truth about grave allegations of multiple murder involving UK Special Forces.\n\"Mr Mercer accepts the inquiry has secure measures in place to protect the names and identities of his sources and that witnesses coming forward to the inquiry have protection from risk of prosecution for breaches of the Official Secrets Act or for failure to report misconduct.\"\nMr Mercer now has until 25 July to hand over the names to the inquiry.\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary said the \"Kevin Keegan effect\" meant people still viewed him as a member of a group banned under UK terror laws, a court has heard.\nMr Choudary, 57, faces charges including that he \"directed\" the group Al Muhajiroun (ALM) - which he told the court was wound up in 2004 - as well as being a member for \"many years\" and encouraging support for it through online meetings. \nGiving evidence, he said: \"If you ask about Kevin Keegan, people say \u2018he plays football for Liverpool'. People look at me and think Al Muhajiroun.\u201d\nHe is on trial alongside Khaled Hussein, 29, from Edmonton in Canada, who is accused of being a member of a banned organisation. Both men deny the charges.\nMr Choudary, of Ilford, east London, was giving evidence for the first time at his trial at Woolwich Crown Court, where he is charged with directing a terrorism organisation, and being a member of and supporting a banned group.\nHe told the jury he was one of the original three members of ALM, which was founded in 1996 after his mentor Omar Bakri Mohammed left another Islamist group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir.\nHe said over time Bakri Mohammed became more salafist - a purist branch of Islam that relies almost entirely on the teachings of the Companions of the Prophet who had known Prophet Mohammed - and that to avoid confusion the organisation was wound up in 2004.\nHis barrister Paul Hynes KC asked: \u201cWas Al Muhajiroun replaced by another organisation?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\" Mr Choudary said. \u201cPeople from the outside said that\u2019s the same people.\u201d\nWhen asked if his role in the group is what he is most famous for, he replied: \"Yes, it was the Kevin Keegan effect, I've never moved on from him playing for Liverpool.\"\nMr Choudary said he became known as a member while the group sought publicity between 1996 and 2004.\nHe added: \"People still remember you, in the same way Nigel Farage is UKIP, George Galloway is Respect.\"\nThe prosecution argues that ALM continued as an organisation, merely changing its name. \nIt was first banned - or proscribed - by the home secretary in 2006 under the name Al Ghurabaa. In 2010, ALM was included in the ban as an alternate name.\nThe prosecution says Mr Choudary was still acting as the effective leader of ALM as late as July 2023, making online speeches to an offshoot in America called the Islamic Thinkers Society (ITS).\nMr Choudary said the suggestion that ALM continued under the name of ITS was \"nonsense\", saying the organisation was formed in 2003 amid disagreements with ALM over ideology.\nHe told the court that ITS members were \"attacking\" ALM's positions in online posts.\nDuring his evidence, Mr Choudary explained to the jury why he tweeted \u201cAllah bless Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, the Khalifah\u201d in 2014 about the leader of the Islamic State group.\nHe said he had done this because he believed a legitimate Islamic caliphate had been established in parts of Iraq and Syria.\nHe was jailed in 2016 for encouraging support for the Islamic State group.

    "Conservative candidate Miriam Cates was a trustee of a church while it promoted so-called conversion therapy, the BBC has learned.\nAn independent report has concluded that conversion practices - which seek to change or suppress someone\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity - were \u201cendorsed and supported\u201d by St Thomas Philadelphia church in Sheffield between 2014 and 2019.\nMrs Cates was a member of the church between 2003 and 2018, and a trustee from 2016 to 2018. She told the BBC she was unaware of the allegations and that she does not endorse gay conversion therapy.\nAlthough the BBC has not found any evidence Mrs Cates had direct knowledge of gay conversion therapy taking place, the report found that it was openly discussed and part of the church\u2019s culture during the time she was a member, and some of her time as a trustee.\nThe Church of England\u2019s Diocese of Sheffield requested charity Barnardo\u2019s carry out an independent investigation into the church after Matt Drapper, a gay man, complained he was the victim of an \u201cexorcism\u201d ritual there in 2014 - before Mrs Cates was on the board of trustees.\nThe report was published on Monday shortly after it was leaked to the BBC\nIt said \u201cthe culture of the church [in 2014] was one in which the presence of evil spirits and \u2018ungodly soul ties\u2019 were believed to be the cause of homosexual thoughts, feelings and behaviour, and prayers of \u2018deliverance\u2019 for homosexuals were not uncommon\u201d.\nContributors told the report authors that while gay members of the church would be welcomed, there was a \u201cfirm belief\u201d that these individuals would \u201ceventually understand the need to be transformed to live in accordance with biblical revelation and orthodox church teachings\u201d.\nThe authors were also told that exorcisms being carried out \u201cwere often spoken about by church members\u201d and that on one occasion \u201cthere were celebrations in the congregation because a parent stood up and spoke of an adult in their family, who had been \u2018delivered from the sin of homosexuality\u2019\u201d.\nAs a director and trustee at the charity behind the church from September 2016 to September 2018, Mrs Cates, had safeguarding responsibilities for those who attended.\nMr Drapper, who first raised the allegations with the church in March 2018 and lodged his formal complaint in 2019, said he had continuing trauma as a result of the incident, which occurred at a \u201cvulnerable\u201d time in his life, while he was trying to reconcile his sexuality with his Christian faith.\nHis complaint, which Miriam Cates said she was never made aware of, was not formally submitted until November 2019 after she had left the church.\nAll aspects of his complaint were upheld by the investigation team \u2013 but their report, completed in February 2024, was only published by the diocese after it was leaked to the BBC.\nThe diocese told the BBC in a statement that it had been working \u201curgently\u201d for the past month towards publication, subject to \u201clight\u201d redactions.\nWhile the report references the general attitudes and culture around homosexual members and the practice of \u201cdeliverance\u201d to change their sexual orientation, it did not rule on any individual\u2019s involvement.\nA report on the church\u2019s current behaviour found that \u201cprayers, or indeed any actions, which seek to change a person\u2019s sexuality [are] not accepted by Church leaders today in the way it may have been ten years ago.\u201d\nThe BBC has seen social media posts from Mrs Cates made in November 2012, which suggest she attended a conference hosted by a third party at the church which Mr Drapper has described as an \u201cexorcism training weekend\u201d.\nAudio from the conference, which the BBC has not verified, suggests it involved practising a prayer of repentance \u201cfor giving place to any demons \u2026 including demons of\u2026 homosexuality\u2026 lesbianism\u201d.\nMrs Cates denies attending an \u201cexorcism training weekend\u201d.\nShe said she \u201cdid attend a conference at the Church in 2012, although I have no diary records of the time, and to the best of my recollection, this was a standard Church conference with a series of seminars, bible teachings and worship.\n\u201cI have no recollection of the content or title of any of the seminars that took place at the conference because it took place well over a decade ago. \u201c\nBarnardo\u2019s said it was contacted by another individual who attended a course at the church on \"inner healing\" and \"deliverance\" in 2017, during which a book was handed out to participants.\nIt described a \u201clink between spirit possession and homosexuality and the ways in which these spirits should and could be expelled and how, as a consequence, homosexuals would be \u2018healed\u2019\u201d.\nThe investigators also heard from others who said they had either \u201cheard about or observed ministries which sought to \u2018heal\u2019 homosexuals\u201d.\nDocuments and screenshots seen by the BBC indicate that \"healing\" and \"deliverance\" courses involving sexuality and \u201csexual identity\u201d were still being hosted at the church in November 2019.\nDuring her time in Parliament, Mrs Cates was a",

    "At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a UN-run school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured. \nThe building was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael said it had struck several Hamas \u201cterrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School\u201d.\nA local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. A spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said the claims were \"very, very serious\" and should be investigated. \n\nThe attack comes as hopes rise that a deal between Israel and Hamas is on the horizon, following months of false starts.\nIsrael has announced it will send a team of negotiators next week to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas.\nIt comes after a senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to \"pretty significant adjustments\" to its position regarding a potential ceasefire. \nA senior Hamas source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that the group had agreed to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages 16 days after the proposed first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war. \n\nVideo from the scene of the Nuseirat school strike shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded.\nEyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market. \nThe BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter.\nOne woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit.\n\"This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning,\" she said.\nHamas said five local journalists were among those killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday. Members of their family were also reportedly targeted. \nMore than 100 journalists have lost their lives in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, according to Reporters Without Borders. \nHamas said the five latest fatalities brings the number to 158.\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken \"numerous steps\" to \"mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence\".\nHamas militants were using the location as a \"hideout\" to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said.\n\"Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel,\" it added.\nHamas called the attack a \u201cmassacre\u201d on \u201cdefenceless displaced civilians\u201d. \nMany of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel.\nMany schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months.\n\"We don\u2019t have all the information yet. Since the war began, we have had more than  half of our facilities hit,\" Juliette Touma, Unrwa's communications director, told the BBC regarding the latest attack.  \n\"Many of them were shelters, and as a result at least 500 people sheltering in those facilities have been killed. Many were women and children.\"\nShe added it was not the first time Israel had made such claims, and that they should be investigated. \nA previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat killed at least 35 people.\nLocal journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school.\nAfter that attack, Israel\u2019s military said it had \u201cconducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound\u201d in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside.\nThe head of the Unrwa described the June incident as \"horrific\" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was \"shocking\" but could not be confirmed.\nIsrael\u2019s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.\nAt least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael has regularly accused Unrwa of supporting Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries.\nThe organisation has rejected this. \nIn April, a UN investigation found Israel had failed to back up a claim that many of the agency's staff belonged militant groups, but also said it could improve its neutrality, staff vetting and transparency.

    "A man accused of masterminding a plan to abduct, rape and murder Holly Willoughby was living a \"dark, twisted fantasy\", his barrister argued.\nDefending Gavin Plumb, Sasha Wass KC said the 37-year-old held \"vile and misogynistic\" conversations online but they were \"a fantasy nonetheless\".\nThe trial at Chelmsford Crown Court was previously told that Mr Plumb was arrested after disclosing his alleged plot to an undercover police officer from the US.\nSecurity guard Mr Plumb, from Harlow, Essex, has denied soliciting murder, inciting rape and inciting kidnap.\nThe prosecution alleged that Mr Plumb wanted to live out his \"ultimate fantasy\" by taking Ms Willoughby from her home by force and leading her to a \"dungeon\".\nDefending her client, Ms Wass said in her closing speech that he \"neither had the means nor the opportunity\" to undertake the so-called plan.\n\"The fun - if that is the right word - was fantasising, the pretending that the plan would be put into effect,\" she told the jury.\n\"There is no doubt that Gavin Plumb sent the messages and there is no doubt that the content of the messages are vile and misogynistic - and Mr Plumb himself accepted they were dark.\"\nDuring the trial, the jury was played a voice note Mr Plumb sent to a man only known as Marc in March 2023.\nIt outlined a plan to \"hit\" Ms Willoughby's house at night before using chloroform to incapacitate her.\n\"We\u2019re then gonna force her to make a video saying she came with us under her own free will\u2026 and she\u2019s fully consenting to everything we do to her \u2013 so that covers us,\" Mr Plumb said in the voice note.\nIt was also alleged he messaged Marc saying: \"I'm now at the point that fantasy isn't enough anymore.

    "Water companies could face a \"flood\" of legal challenges over sewage discharges, lawyers have said, after a landmark Supreme Court ruling.\nOn Tuesday, seven justices at the UK's highest court ruled that the Manchester Ship Canal Company is able to sue United Utilities over the alleged release of raw sewage into the canal.\nSpeaking to the BBC, one lawyer said owners of adjacent waterways or even members of the public could bring claims against other utility companies as a result.\nEnvironmental charities said the ruling was good news. \nIt comes at a time when water companies have been under significant financial pressure and scrutiny for unauthorised discharges of waste.\nThe panel of judges found that the Manchester Ship Canal Company was entitled to bring a nuisance or trespass claim for compensation over the release of \"untreated foul water\". \nIt comes despite previous rulings to the contrary in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal, which led to the private company's appeal.\nThere are about 100 United Utilities outfalls along the canal, where treated waste is released from the sewerage network.\nRaw sewage is also dumped when the system is operating over capacity, something the judges said could be avoided if the firm \"invested in improved infrastructure and treatment\".\nA lengthy legal battle took place between the canal company, owned by the Peel Group, and United Utilities.\nThe water provider argued that only regulators could take action over the spills, with the original 1991 act that privatised the sector providing it with protection. \nBut Paul Greatholder, partner at law firm Russell Cooke, said that the ruling on Tuesday meant the \"floodgates are open\".\n\"This could bring a range of potential claims from either the owners of adjacent waterways, or even from members of the public who have been made unwell as a consequence,\" he said.\nEmily Nicholson, partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya said: \"If millions of copycat claims then spring up, that will be a reflection of the utility companies' failures rather than the failure of the courts or legal system.\"\nShe said that those affected by any failures, such as swimmers, fishermen and environmental organisations, now at least have a route to seek redress.\nMr Greatholder also suggested that the Supreme Court had put down a \"marker\" for water utility companies in claiming that issues could have been avoided if more investment had gone into improving the canal's infrastructure.\n\"No doubt the same could be said of all water companies. Thames Water has spent billions of pounds on a \u2018supersewer\u2019 running through London to try to mitigate just this sort of issue,\" he added.\nWater firms including Thames Water have come under significant scrutiny over their environmental records in recent months.\nRecent BBC analysis found that every major English water company had reported data suggesting they've discharged raw sewage when the weather is dry - a practice which is potentially illegal.\nOn Tuesday, United Utilities said it \"understood and shared\" concerns about the need to improve, and pointed to a \u00a33bn investment plan aimed at cutting pollution by improving infrastructure.\nThe Environmental Law Foundation, a charity which intervened in the Supreme Court hearing in March, welcomed the ruling.\nIts co-director Emma Montlake, said: \"Our water environments have been regularly polluted with untreated sewage, water biodiversity denuded and degraded with impunity by private water companies.\n\"A national scandal doesn't come close to describing what we have put up with. This is a glad day for environmental justice, not just for the public, but for nature.\"\nSome have pointed out however, that this could pose another big challenge for utility companies, when some already struggling under huge debt piles.\nRecently, additional powers were granted to the Environment Agency to issue unlimited fines, with industry sources telling the BBC that \"the combination of fines and potential private lawsuits could make the difference between firms being able to operate and going under.\"\nThey also expressed concern over what may happen to any damages awarded to private companies or individuals, in contrast with when regulators issue fines and that money raised is returned to customers. \nSources close to the watchdog Ofwat said that the ruling would not affect their interim decision on what water companies are allowed to charge customers from next year, which is due out next Thursday.\nBut they added that they could imagine that water companies may make an argument that an increase in claims against them would be an additional cost they would need to make provision for - pushing up their costs and ultimately consumer bills. \nThe final decision on what companies can charge next year is not due until December.",
    "A man has completed a challenge to run the equivalent of about 17 marathons over 30 days on the same half-mile (0.8 km) \"mundane\" stretch of road in Waddington, Lincolnshire.\nThe 38-year-old, who ran under the pseudonym Neville because he wanted to remain anonymous, raised more than \u00a38,500 for cancer research.\nNeville was also joined by co-runners each day, all of whom had been affected by cancer in some way.\nDescribing the challenge as a \"bit spicy\", Neville said it was \"nothing compared to what people go through with cancer\".\n\nThe challenge involved running the same number of miles each day commensurate with the calendar date.\nHe ran one mile on 1 June, two miles on 2 June, increasing to 30 miles on 30 June.\n\nNeville, who also ran the final mile of each day while carrying the Cancer Research UK flag, wearing springy eye glasses, and shouting \"just one more mile\", was joined by host of co-runners.\nThese included a man who is undergoing treatment for throat cancer and is fed though a tube, a cancer nurse who travelled three hours to take part and people running in memory of a loved one.\n\"Nearly all of them pushed themselves several miles beyond any distance they had previously run, all because they believed in the work that Cancer Research UK do,\" he said. \n\"Each had their own motivation for getting involved; stories of beating the odds, stories of loss, stories of ongoing battles,\" he added.\nNeville said he was the antipode of the type of person who you might expect to take on such a challenge, adding that the final week had been especially hard due to the heat and the distance.\n\"But in the grand scheme of things, this was about raising money for cancer research, so tiredness and blisters are nothing compared to what people go through with cancer,\" he said.\nTo date, including gift aid, the charity effort has raised more than \u00a38,500. \nThe runner said donations were still coming in and he hoped \"it might just creep over the \u00a310,000 line\".\nPeople could also read the personal stories of those who took part on Neville's Instagram page, he said.\nHe added that the character of Neville would now \"quietly slip away\" after being heard quoting Forrest Gump.\n\"I'm pretty tired.

    "A painting described as a masterpiece which was found in a plastic bag after being stolen has sold for \u00a317.6m at auction.\nRest On The Flight Into Egypt, painted by Venetian master Titian when he was aged just 20 in 1510, was sold by London auction house Christie's. \nThe work was stolen from the drawing room of stately home Longleat in Wiltshire in 1995, but was found seven years later without its frame in a plastic carrier bag in London. \nIts sale sets a new world auction record for the artist, auctioneers said. \nLord Bath, who succeeded his father as the Marquess of Bath in 2020, inheriting the Longleat estate, said the painting had an \"extraordinary history\". \nSpeaking ahead of the sale, he said: \"We have a considerable long-term investment strategy at Longleat and have decided to sell this asset to further this agenda at a time when the market for paintings of such unique rarity is so strong.\"\nThe picture, which depicts Mary cradling Jesus as Joseph looks on, is 2ft (60cm) wide and painted on a wooden panel. \nIt has had many owners over the years, including Austrian Emperor Joseph II, before being hung at the Belvedere Palace in Vienna.\nFrench troops looted the painting in 1809 for the Napoleon Museum, which was assembled by the Bonaparte family.\nIt was later owned by a Scottish landowner before being bought by the fourth Marquess of Bath in 1878 at a Christie's auction. \nAfter being stolen in 1995, it was recovered in 2002 by former Scotland Yard detective Charles Hill after a \u00a3100,000 reward was offered for information. \nMr Hill is also credited with helping to recover Edvard Munch's The Scream after it was stolen in 1994, as well as other famous artworks.\nSpeaking ahead of the auction, Andrew Fletcher, Christie's global head of the Old Masters Department, said it was the most important work by Titian to come to the auction market \"in more than a generation\". \nHe added that the picture was \"a truly outstanding example of the artist's pioneering approach to both the use of colour and the representation of the human form in the natural world\".\nHe said the piece secured Titian's status as \"one of the greatest painters in the history of Western art\".\nThe painting had had an auction estimate of \u00a315m-\u00a320m.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "When Fatima Payman crossed the Senate floor to vote against her government she knew it would come with consequences.\nThe Australian Labor party has strict penalties for those who undermine its collective positions, and acts of defiance can lead to expulsion - a precedent with a 130-year history.\nThe last time one of its politicians tested the waters while in power was before Ms Payman was born.\nBut last Tuesday, the 29-year-old did just that - joining the Greens party and independent senators to support a motion on Palestinian statehood.\nOfficially the Australian government supports a two-state solution, but did not back the motion after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be \u201cas part of a peace process\u201d.\nWithin hours, Ms Payman had been temporarily suspended from her party room, by the end of the week it would become indefinite - after she publicly vowed to cross the floor again if given the opportunity.\n\"By her own actions and statements, Senator Payman has placed herself outside the privilege that comes with participating in the federal parliamentary Labor Party caucus,\" a government spokesperson said.\nPrime Minister and Labor leader Anthony Albanese was more concise: \u201cNo individual is bigger than the team.\u201d\nOn Monday, Ms Payman responded by saying she had been \"exiled\" \u2013 explaining that she had been removed from caucus meetings, group chats and all committees.\nThe dismissal of the senator, elected in what was billed as Australia\u2019s most diverse parliament to date, has drawn a mixed response and raised questions - mainly, whether it\u2019s practical or fair for politicians to toe the line on issues affecting their communities.\nMs Payman stands out in Australia\u2019s parliament.\nThe first and only hijab-wearing federal politician, she has been described as the embodiment of some of the nation\u2019s most marginalised: a young woman, a migrant, a Muslim.\nShe recounted crossing the Senate floor as \"the most difficult decision\" of her political career, adding that each step of her short walk had \u201cfelt like a mile\u201d.\nHowever, the 29-year-old said she was \u201cproud\u201d of what she had done, and \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d others hadn't followed.\n\"I walked with my Muslim brothers and sisters who told me they have felt unheard for far too long,\" she said.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 23 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThis has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage.\nAs has been the case in countless other countries, there have been protests from both Jewish and Muslim communities, as well as a sharp uptick in Islamophobia and antisemitism.\nThe senator's move has drawn both praise and criticism.\nAnne Aly - who became the first Muslim woman to be elected in Australia\u2019s parliament in 2016 - and has been a fierce advocate for an end to the conflict in Gaza, said she disagreed with Ms Payman\u2019s approach.\n\u201cI choose to do things in a way I think will make a material difference on the ground. Fatima chooses to do it her way,\" she told news outlet the ABC.\nBut Josh Burns - a Jewish Labor MP from Melbourne - who has a different world view from Ms Payman when it comes to issues such as Palestinian statehood, has been one of her biggest supporters.\n\u201cParliamentarians come from different communities and backgrounds, and trying to balance all those perspectives isn't easy, but we must be an example to the Australian community about how to debate difficult issues respectfully.\u201d\nThe nation\u2019s Islamic bodies have also issued a joint statement describing Ms Payman\u2019s actions as \u201ccourageous\u201d and calling on the Labor party to \u201cecho the voices of the people it represents\u201d.\n\"Political calculations and attempts to walk both sides have devastating consequences in Palestine and will ultimately end in failure,\u201d it read.\nBut Mr Albanese called the resolution a \"stunt\", adding: \"We need actually real solutions... this stunt from the Greens was designed to put Fatima Payman in a difficult position. It was designed to do that.\"\nMr Albanese\u2019s penalty against Ms Payman has been more lenient than the complete expulsion that party rules require.\nAnd he\u2019s left the door open for her to re-enter the fold if she\u2019s willing to change course: \u201cFatima Payman is welcome to return to participating in the team if she accepts she's a member of it,\u201d he said in an interview on Monday.\nAustralian politicians have voted against their own beliefs to fall in line with party politics before.\nLGBTQ+ MPs - including current Foreign Minister Penny Wong - felt a similar conflict in the Labor caucus back in the days when it officially opposed gay marriage.\nIt\u2019s an issue that has ",

    "A woman was hit in the face with a stone during a racially-motivated incident in east Belfast, police have said. \nThe victim was walking home from work on Sunday evening when up to six young people started throwing objects toward her on London Road, in the east of the city.\nShe was struck on the face with a stone, police said. \nThis incident followed reports of anti-social behaviour towards local residents in the same area on Saturday. \nBoth incidents are being treated as racially-motivated, police said. \nIn an earlier statement, a police spokesman confirmed that officers received a report of water balloons being thrown at a householder in the London Road area on Saturday.\nThe Belfast Telegraph has reported the woman's family have left their home in the area after being racially abused for two nights in a row. \nPSNI Supt Finola Dornan said that \"incidents like these are unacceptable\". \n\"They not only deeply affect victims but have a really damaging impact on the whole community,\" Supt Dornan said. \nPolice are working to identify all those involved. \nSo far, officers have identified one child who was involved. Specialist youth diversion officers are following up with this child and their parents. \nSpeaking to BBC News NI on Thursday, Alliance MLA for East Belfast Peter McReynolds said he was aware that one of the young people involved was between the age of eight or nine. \nMr McReynolds said he viewed footage of the incident, describing it as \"horrifying to see\".\n\"It doesn't represent East Belfast, it doesn't represent the residents in the area. It was horrific to see that someone has had to experience that. My heart goes out to that family,\" he said. \nMr McReynolds said that there can be anti-social behaviour within the area, adding that there has been a sustained police presence in the past while. \nHowever, he added that the area is also \"quite calm and the residents are pleasant, lovely people who are keen to have it better represented\". \nSpeaking of the victim, Mr McReynolds says he would \"urge her to not think bad of Belfast\". \n\"I think this is a handful of individuals who are behaving like this.\"  \nSupt Dornan said police will continue to support the victim following the \"distressing experience\". \n\"Hate crime hurts and damages local communities and targeting anyone because of who they are or represent is utterly deplorable and must be called out,\" Supt Dornan said. \nMr McReynolds said some people \"have grown up\" thinking an incident like this is \"normal behaviour\". \n\"We need to show them that it isn\u2019t the way that a normal Northern Ireland in 2024 operates,\" Mr McReynolds said. \n\"We need to have education, we need to have learning, we need to have understanding that these actions aren\u2019t appropriate and accepted in Northern Ireland in 2024,\" he added. \nThe PSNI has called on the public to contact them if they are aware of hate-related activity taking place. \n\"Remember the victim won't necessarily be the first to make a report to police, they may need your assistance to speak up for them, so please do get in touch with us,\" Supt Dornan said. \nShe said she would also like to appeal directly to parents in the area, \"who I know will want to prevent their children becoming involved in any such behaviour going forward\".

I made it clear the ministerial code, they will be receiving a copy of it, and it will have the Nolan Principles inside and alongside it.\u201d\nThe so-called Nolan Principles were first set out almost 30 years ago and aim to set a moral template against which those in high office should judge their actions.\nThe Seven Principles of Public Life, as they are also known, are selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.\n\u201cThat is the standards I expect of them. As I\u2019ve said throughout, people falling short of the required standards will face consequences, as you would expect,\u201d the prime minister said.\nFor more than a decade there have been calls for the independent adviser on ministers' interests to be able to initiate their own investigations.\nIn 2012, MPs called for the change  to be implemented saying they felt Sir Philip Mawer, the man in the role at the time, had been \"cut out of the loop\" of an inquiry into then-Conservative minister Liam Fox.\nDave Penman, head of the FDA trade union for senior civil servants, said in 2021 that the current situation creates an \"obvious conflict\", adding: \"The way to stop difficult decisions having to be made under the ministerial code is to stop any investigation in the first place.\"",
    "Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) have been a divisive local issue in east Oxford since they were first introduced in 2021. But with election day just around the corner, how much of a vote decider will they be?\nAn LTN is an area with infrastructure in place preventing most vehicles from driving through. \nThe aim is to create quieter and safer streets for residents to cycle or walk.\nLTNs were originally introduced in east Oxford in 2021 as part of an 18-month trial, and have since been made permanent.\nOne of the criticisms of LTNs is buses are not regular or cheap enough to encourage people to use public transport instead.\nResident Alison Moss thinks they are \"destroying\" the city, and the lack of bus routes available means public transport is not a viable alternative.\nThousands of pounds have been spent on repairing or replacing vandalised traffic bollards. Since the introduction of LTNs, Oxfordshire County Council has spent more than \u00a375,000 fixing them.\nBut while there are vocal critics of LTNs, there is also support for them.\n\"I live in an LTN - it\u2019s really transformed the area,\" says James Schumann.\n\"It has encouraged a few of us out of our cars.\"\nThe recent local elections saw the newly formed Independent Oxford Alliance gain four seats in East Oxford at Oxford City Council, even taking away some from Labour. One of their main policies was to remove LTNs.\nDavid Henwood is the party\u2019s candidate for Oxford East in the general election.\n\"They create longer car journeys, more pollution and more congestion,\" he says.\nIt has been a big local issue in recent years, but this is the first opportunity since LTNs were introduced that the issue could be brought up at a national level.\nOxford East\u2019s Labour candidate, Anneliese Dodds, thinks that bus services should be improved first as \"not everyone in Oxford can cycle or walk\".\nLouise Brown is the Conservative party candidate. She says that East Oxford does not have enough cycle lanes or regular buses, making LTNs \"unworkable\".\nThe Green Party\u2019s candidate, Sushila Dhall, says LTNs lead to \"safer, more pleasant spaces for people to walk, use wheelchairs, cycle, play and meet up\".\nTheo Jupp, who is standing for the Liberal Democrats, believes they should be taken on a case by case basis, which should be adapted if necessary \"to improve each neighbourhood\u2019s needs\".\nThe Independents and Social Democratic Party also oppose LTNs. \nThe Party of Women believes it should be voted on by constituents. \nThe Workers Party of Britain says it would welcome LTNs if all travel for children was free.

    "A depot worker walking on the tracks was struck by a train after it began to move \"much quicker\" than they expected, a report has found. \nThe staff member responsible for shunting trains was seriously injured as a train left the St Philips Marsh Depot, Bristol, on 26 September 2023. \nA report published on Thursday by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) recommended two actions to Great Western Railway (GWR) in the wake of the incident. \nA GWR spokesperson said a \"thorough review of risk mitigations\" has been conducted.\nThe train was travelling at 10mph, double the speed limit in place at the depot. \nThe train driver did not see the shunter, who was walking in his path, but braked immediately after hearing the vehicle hit something. \nThe worker was hit on the elbow by the train coming from behind, the report said, and threw themselves forward to avoid going under the train. \nTheir high-visibility vest then caught on the side of the train, dragging them a short distance until the vest's fastenings gave way.\nThey sustained serious injuries to their ankle, as well as other injuries to their knuckle, elbow, shoulder and head, and was treated by paramedics before being taken to hospital. \nA summary of the report outlined how the shunter had \"regularly used\" the walking route where he was hit, but had been unaware that the train was moving and \"did not realise it was catching up with them\". \nThe RAIB identified two underlying factors for the incident.

    "The Scottish secretary has promised that UK and Scottish government ministers will adopt a \"one-team approach\" to securing a future for Grangemouth oil refinery.\nAround \u00a31.5m of funding, paid for by both governments, has been allocated to producing a report exploring options for the site.\nMinisters want to consider longer-term opportunities for Grangemouth that involve low carbon industries.\nOwner Petroineos announced it intends to cease refinery operations by 2025, putting 400 jobs at risk. \nSpeaking to BBC Scotland News, Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said that the UK government was \"fully committed\" to the future of the site, and that governments in London and Edinburgh had been working \"hand in glove\".\nHe said: \"It\u2019s an incredibly exciting proposal, it gives a big commitment from both governments that we are committed to the long term future of Grangemouth.\n\"The workforce can be assured that both governments are working in partnership hand in hand to make sure we can get there.\n\"It sends out a very clear message that both governments are working together in the interests of the people in Scotland.\"\nMr Murray has recently said he believes the Grangemouth site could become a \"bio plant\" for greener industries, such as sustainable aviation fuel.\nThe UK government Energy Secretary Ed Miliband and the Scottish government's acting Energy Secretary Gillian Martin will also co-chair a working group tasked with looking at the future of the plant.\nMr Miliband said: \u201cThe UK government will leave no stone unturned in seeking a future for the Grangemouth site and its workers.\n\u201cWe are committed to boosting growth through an industrial strategy, and to engaging with the workers and communities of Grangemouth and the Scottish government.\"\nMr Murray added that Mr Miliband was in \"constant discussion\" with Petroineos about short-term issues at the plant.\nMs Martin added: \u201cThe Scottish government wishes refining at Grangemouth to continue for as long as practicable and recognises that the site, and its workforce, are crucial to Scotland\u2019s economy and our transition to net zero.\n\u201cWe are committed to working collaboratively with Petroineos, UK government ministers and Unite the Union to explore the options available to secure a long term, sustainable future for the site and accelerate new employment opportunities.\nIt is understood that each government has invested \u00a3800,000 into producing the report.\nMr Murray would not say if Grangemouth could be the base of the publicly-owned energy company GB Energy, but said that the government would announce a location \"fairly shortly\".\nGrangemouth oil refinery near Falkirk is home to one of the first oil refineries in the UK, which is still a major supplier of aviation and ground fuels across Scotland\nOil operations at the site can be traced back to 1919. The refinery, established in 1924, was one of the first crude oil refineries in the UK.\nGrangemouth was run by Innovene until 2005. Ineos - owned by one of Britain's richest men Jim Ratcliffe - bought Innovene in a \u00a35bn takeover.\nIn 2019 plans were announced to build a \u00a3350m energy plant at the site, as part of a \u00a31bn investments in the UK oil and chemical industries.\nBut in 2023, owners Petroineos announced they intend to turn the site into a fuels import terminal due to \"global market pressure\".\nOnly 100 staff would be needed for the planned import terminal.\nAbout 2,000 people are directly employed at Grangemouth including 500 at the refinery, 450 on the Forties pipeline from the North Sea and a further 1,000 in the Ineos petrochemicals business - meaning the change in operations would put 400 jobs at risk.",
    "A GP practice that has set up two operating theatres has helped to save the NHS \u00a31.5m a year while cutting hospital waiting lists, its bosses have said.\nSt Stephen's Gate Medical Practice in Norwich city centre has been carrying out almost 4,400 surgical procedures a year at its N2S Norwich and Norfolk Day Surgery Unit.\nPatient Andrew Downes, from Burston near Diss, Norfolk, had his hernia repaired on Wednesday and said he was \"glad to get it done\" so quickly.\nN2S medical director Dr Alex Baker said if the unit was copied across the country it could help the new Labour government achieve its NHS targets and \"make a huge difference\".\nConsultants operate the unit, where they undertake hernia operations, hand surgery, cataract procedures and laser procedures on patients who go home the same day.\nMr Downes, 81, has been one of hundreds of people this year to have his hernia operated on under local anaesthetic at the NHS site following the required referral to specialists.\nThe current waiting time at N2S for a hernia operation - which is done via open surgery, leaving a small scar, as opposed to in a keyhole procedure - is 12 weeks.\nAt the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, nearly 7,500 people were on the waiting list to start general surgery - including hernias - as of April.\nJust over 50% of patients were treated within 18 weeks, but the standard is supposed to be 92%.\nMr Downes said that although he had chosen to delay his operation until his wife's health had improved, he had then plumped for the unit to get it done quicker.\n\"I\u2019d rather have it done quickly at a practice like N2S than wait umpteen months to have it done at a hospital,\" he said.\n\"If I was waiting for the hospital, who knows how long I\u2019d wait? It could be months, years even, so I\u2019m not complaining.\n\"It makes no difference to me where it\u2019s done - they\u2019ve been vetted and inspected and are obviously the standard required to do it.\"\nNHS England said it believed the practice was one of only a few carrying out hernia operations.\nThe national body has been looking at ways to improve health services, and in October 2023 it said up to 400,000 patients waiting more than 40 weeks could travel to a different hospital to be seen sooner.\nHowever, many people may feel unable to travel, particularly without support networks.\nManagers at St Stephen's Gate said its hernia cases, subject of a recent peer-reviewed research paper, meant local hospital theatres could be used for more complex operations, thereby cutting waiting lists.\nThe unit, which has been undertaking surgical procedures for seven years, has been relieving pressure on three hospitals: Norfolk and Norwich, Queen Elizabeth in King's Lynn and James Paget in Gorleston.\nIn its manifesto, Labour said it would deliver an extra 40,000 operations, scans and appointments a week - two million a year - in England by introducing more weekend services, as well as turning to the private sector.\nDr Alex Baker, who is also a GP partner at St Stephen's Gate, said they had worked with local hospitals, commissioners and consultants to \"find solutions to improve the long waiting times\".\n\"We have saved the NHS \u00a31.5m this year and that's across all of our surgical specialities,\" she said.\n\"By us doing these day cases, it frees up the hospital to do their much more complicated cases that require general anaesthetics or inpatient stays.\n\"If 100 GP surgeries are able to embark on a similar setting to this, we could really come a long way to meet the targets that Labour has introduced.\n\"If you could extrapolate that to many other sites across the country, you could make a huge difference to the current situation to the NHS.\"\nOn Thursday, latest figures showed the waiting list for routine hospital treatment in England had risen for a second consecutive month, to 7.6 million.\nProf Sir Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: \u201cFrontline teams are continuing to work exceptionally hard under significant pressure to provide the best care they can for patients, but everyone recognises that access and waiting times are currently far from what the public have a right to expect.\n\u201cEveryone working in the health service is committed to working with the government, and with patients and the public, to tackle these challenges.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The Republic of Ireland's economy grew strongly in 2023, official figures suggest.\nThe headline measure, gross national income (GNI), expanded by 5% according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO).\nMost countries use gross domestic product (GDP) as the key measure of economic performance but Irish GDP is badly distorted by the activities of multinational companies.\nGNI, which has been used since 2017, strips out the most distorting effects to give a more accurate picture of the real economy.\nIt involves subtracting the retained profits of some firms which have Irish HQs and making adjustments for some foreign-owned assets which are located in Ireland.\nIn contrast to the increase in GNI, there was a 5.5% fall in GDP due to reduced goods exports by multinational companies.\nThe CSO\u2019s assistant girector general, Chris Sibley, said: \"The more globalised sectors of the economy contracted for the first time since 2013. Overall, the multinational sector contraction was 16.2%.\"\nBy contrast the figures point to a recovering domestic economy with personal spending on goods and services rising by almost 5% in 2023.\nThe Irish labour market has performed strongly over the last year with unemployment at record lows.\n Minister for Finance Jack Chambers said the CSO figures confirmed strong growth in the domestic economy.\n\"Despite facing significant inflationary pressures, consumer spending nevertheless drove growth in the domestic economy,\" he added.\n\"This performance reflects the strength of the labour market, which has been at full employment since mid-2022.\"\nFigures for the first quarter of 2024 suggest the growth momentum has continued.\nThe key short term measure of domestic economic performance, modified domestic demand (MDD), grew by 1% compared to the final quarter of 2023.\nMr Chambers is planning to increase public spending by almost 7% in a pre-election budget in October.\nHe has faced criticism from an independent spending watchdog that a generous budget risks reigniting inflation.",

    "By BBC Monitoring and Matthew Davis\nThe Conservatives have emerged with \"broken bones\" from the UK election after Rishi Sunak's \"dismal end\" - but the big question for some in the international media is whether the \"bland, even boring\" Keir Starmer can clean up the UK's \"mess\".\nLabour's landslide victory is being digested by commentators all over the world, many dissecting what the results mean for relations with the UK - as well as for the future of the Conservative Party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.\nThe rise of Reform UK also generates many international column inches of coverage, especially in Europe where it didn't go unnoticed that its leader, the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, became an MP for the first time. \nFor Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the results mean \"the British [have] had a burden lifted from their shoulders\", but any renewed stability in the UK is seen as fragile.\nVoters \"were primarily concerned with getting rid of the Conservatives,\" the paper says, adding that \"Labour has a stable majority, but also problems within the party\".\nGerman business daily Handelsblatt says the British election result \"opens up the opportunity to correct Brexit\".\n\"Now is the time to correct one of the biggest mistakes in British politics. A security pact with the EU can only be the beginning,\" the paper said.\nMr Farage\u2019s success attracted a lot of attention. German Tabloid Bild dubbed it an \u201celection earthquake\u201d, albeit one for which the paper says Labour can be thankful, seeing that Reform took many votes from the Conservatives.\nFrench media largely hails Labour\u2019s victory, also noting the election of Nigel Farage. Le Figaro says that despite the Reform party leader\u2019s success in Clacton, \"the British people have overwhelmingly chosen a moderate centre-left leader\".\nAccording to Le Monde, the UK\u2019s return to the centre-left is \"striking, especially seen from France, where the far right has the wind in its sails on the eve of the second round of the legislative elections\".\nItalian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera says of the Conservative defeat: \"The party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher emerges from this election with broken bones: it will take years to recover. Has the right-wing wind that blows across the continent stopped at the English Channel? Obviously not... If the person in charge disappoints, he is replaced.\"\nConservative Italian daily Il Giornale hopes for a return to stability in the UK, calling Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer \u201ca reassuring institutional alternative\u201d.\nBut for Poland's national broadcaster TVP, Mr Starmer is seen as \u201ca bit bland, even boring\u201d. But fortunately for him, the broadcaster says, \u201cprevious leaders of the Conservative Party achieved much worse results\u201d.\nIn Hungary, the press there noted two issues: \u201cUnchanged support for Ukraine\u201d, according to pro-government paper Magyar Nemzet; and Hungarians in the UK hoping for \u201ca more relaxed stance on visa rules and work permits,\u201d said the left-wing paper Telex.\n\nThe New York Times casts Labour's victory as \"a seismic moment in the UK\u2019s politics, returning to power a party that just five years ago suffered its most crushing defeat since the 1930s\".\nBut it also notes the low voter turnout, reporting only about 60% of those eligible cast ballots.\n\"The low figure speaks to the mood of an electorate that seemed frustrated with the last government but hardly full of optimism about the next one. It also pointed to the challenge facing the new Labour government, which will have to work fast if it wants to restore disillusioned voters\u2019 faith in mainstream politics,\" the Times says.\nFor ABC News, Rishi Sunak\u2019s campaign to remain Britain\u2019s prime minister showed a lack of political touch.\n\"Predecessors such as Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were more politically astute and able to connect with voters.\" As for Mr Sunak, he defied political advice by calling the election in May \u2014 \"with Conservative support dwindling steadily amid an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders over the last two years,\" the broadcaster said.\nMeanwhile, a headline in the Wall Street Journal read: \"The UK elects a no-drama prime minister after years of post-Brexit chaos.\"\n\"Eight years after the UK voted to leave the European Union and entered an era of political and economic turmoil, voters have asked Keir Starmer to steady the entire country with his brand of dull competence,\" the paper said.\nBy Rupsha Mukherjee\n\nMost TV channels and news sites in India focused on Rishi Sunak conceding defeat. \n\u201cBritish Indians Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman win seats, but apologise for poor Tory performance,\u201d The Times of India noted.\nThe Wire website called it \"a dismal end to his 20 months as head of government\".\nEverything Sunak tried during the campaign \u201creally failed\u201d, Times Now TV added. \u201cEveryone thought the Conservatives had a plan but now all those plans have fallen flat.\"\nBut the Labour win \u201cis also a triumph for India\u201d, one ",
    "A team of imaging experts, scientists and historians set sail for the Titanic on Friday to gather the most detailed photographic record ever made of the wreck.\nThe BBC had exclusive access to expedition members in the US city of Providence, Rhode Island, as they made preparations to leave port.\nThey'll be using state of the art technology to scan every nook and cranny of the famous liner to gain new insights into its sinking.\nThis is the first commercial mission to Titanic since last year's OceanGate tragedy. Five men died while trying to visit the lost ship in a novel submersible.\nA joint memorial service will be held at sea in the coming days for them and the 1,500 passengers and crew who went down with Titanic in 1912.\nThe new expedition is being mounted by the US company that has sole salvage rights and which to date has brought up some 5,500 objects from the wreck.\nBut this latest visit is purely a reconnaissance mission, says RMS Titanic Inc, based in Atlanta, Georgia.\nTwo robotic vehicles will dive to the ocean bottom to capture millions of high-resolution photographs and to make a 3D model of all the debris.\n\"We want to see the wreck with a clarity and precision that's never before been achieved,\" explained co-expedition lead David Gallo.\nThe logistics ship Dino Chouest is going to be the base for operations out in the North Atlantic.\nWeather permitting, it should spend 20 days above the wreck, which lies in 3,800m (12,500ft) of water.\nIt will be a poignant few weeks for all involved.\nOne of the five who died on the OceanGate sub was Frenchman Paul-Henri (\"PH\") Nargeolet. He was the director of research at RMS Titanic Inc and was due to lead this expedition.\nA plaque will be laid on the seabed in his honour.\n\"It's tough but the thing about exploration is that there's an urge and a drive to keep going. And we're doing that because of that passion PH had for continuous exploration,\" explained friend and historian Rory Golden, who will be \"chief morale officer\" on Dino Chouest.\nThere can be few people on Earth who don't know the story of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic and how it was holed by an iceberg, east of Canada, on the night of 15 April 1912.\nThere are countless books, movies and documentaries about the event.\nBut although the wreck site has been the target of repeated study since its discovery in 1985, there still isn't what could be described as a definitive map.\nAnd while the bow and stern sections of the broken ship are reasonably well understood, there are extensive areas of the surrounding debris field that have received only cursory inspection.\nTwo six-tonne remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) intend to put that right. One will be fitted with an array of ultra-high-definition optical cameras and a special lighting system; the other will carry a sensor package that includes a lidar (laser) scanner.\nTogether, they'll track back and forth across a 1.3km-by-0.97km section of seafloor.\nEvan Kovacs, who's in charge of the imaging programme, says his camera systems should produce millimetre resolution.\n\"If all of the weather gods, the computer gods, the ROV gods, the camera gods -  if all those gods align, we should be able to capture Titanic and the wreck site in as close to digital perfection as you can get. You would be able to quite literally count grains of sand,\" he told BBC News.\nThere's huge anticipation for what the magnetometer aboard the sensor ROV might produce. This is a first for Titanic.\nThe instrument will detect all the metals at the wreck site, even material that is buried out of sight in the sediment.\n\"It would be an absolute dream to determine what has happened with Titanic's bow below the seafloor,\" explained geophysics engineer Alison Proctor.\n\"Hopefully, we'll be able to deduce whether or not the bow was crushed when it hit the seabed, or if it might actually extend down well into the sediment intact.\"\nThe team wants to review the state of some well known objects in the debris field, such as the boilers that spilled out as the opulent steamliner broke in half.\nThere's the desire, too, to locate items thought to have been sighted on previous visits. These include an electric candelabra, which in its day would have been a fascinating curio, as well as the possibility of a second Steinway grand piano.\nThe musical instrument's wooden surround would have long since decayed away, but the cast iron plate, or frame, that held the strings should still be there, and perhaps even some of the keys.\n\"For me, it's the passengers' possessions, especially their bags, that are of greatest interest,\" said Tomasina Ray, who curates the collection of Titanic artefacts held by the company.\n\"It's their belongings - if we are able to retrieve more in the future - that help flesh out their stories. For so many passengers, they are just names on a list, and it's a way to keep them meaningful.\"\nThis will be RMS Titanic Inc's ninth visit to the wreck site.

He said a further meeting to go through the evidence was arranged for 24 May.\n\"Unfortunately, and understandably, Hannah was not able to attend as she had been signed off,\" he said.\nAndrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, asked Mr Gething if he would make public the evidence that he had based his decision on.\nMr Gething said: \"I don't intend to publish any further information.

    "The Department of Health is to get an extra \u00a3122m as part of a Stormont mini- budget.\nMore than \u00a3300m of mostly new money from Westminster has been allocated to Stormont departments - including health, education and social housing - in what is known as a monitoring round.\nMonitoring rounds provide a system to review spending plans and are usually held three times a year, in January, June and October.\nThe mini-budget includes funds which were unspent at the end of the last financial year and new money which flows from Westminster spending decisions.\nEducation gets an additional \u00a388m, about half of which will be used to settle a long-running pay dispute with classrooms assistants and other non-teaching staff.\nFinance Minister Caoimhe Archibald said there was \"quite simply not enough funding available to do all the things we would wish to do\" but the extra money will \"help to mitigate the worst impacts\" of Stormont\u2019s current budget position.\nSpeaking at a press conference at Stormont on Monday, the Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister, Emma Little-Pengelly, said \"no minister will have got everything that they would have asked for\". \nHowever, she added: \"We recognise that is because it is a difficult fiscal situation that we are in\". \nMs Little-Pengelly said the executive is \"determined to fix our health service, tackle waiting lists, ensure that our education system works for everyone, get the investment where it needs to go\".\nShe said that to do that, the executive needs to \"secure additional investment while making sure that we allocate the current funding that we have available in the right places\".\n\"I believe that is what we have done this morning,\" she said. \nHealth Minister Mike Nesbitt said while the extra funding would \"make some contribution to reducing the deficit position facing the system, a significant shortfall still remains\".\n\"I am still not in a position to balance the health budget without taking measures which would be regarded as having a catastrophic impact on services,\" he added.\n\"The ongoing and significant budgetary shortfall is before a 2024/25 pay uplift can be considered.\"\nThe opposition SDLP is to write to the head of the NI Civil Service to question the timing just three days before an election.\nMs Archibald said she had considered the pre-election issue but took the view that the process \"represents normal and routine business of the executive\".\n\"There is also an urgent need to provide funding certainty to departments and even a short delay presents risks,\" she added.\nThe funding of the NI health service has been a source of major political controversy with the Ulster Unionist health minister voting against April\u2019s Stormont budget.\nThe then minister, Robin Swann, said the health budget was being effectively cut and means \"people will be at increased risk of harm\".\nThe additional \u00a3122m is still less than the Department of Health says it needs to avoid damaging cuts to services.\nThe Department of Health\u2019s budget includes an assumption that it would get at least \u00a350m in the monitoring round while the health trusts say they will need an additional \u00a3190m.\nThat would still leave the health budget about \u00a3150m short before the potential impacts of new pay settlements are included.\nOther major allocations in the monitoring round include \u00a335m for general pressures in the Department of Justice and \u00a320m to the Department of Communities for social housing.\nby Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI health correspondent\nThe big black financial hole in health and social care has been filled in a little bit - but not nearly enough, according to the Department of Health.\nFrom Monday, health has an additional \u00a3122m at its disposal in addition to the \u00a37.8bn it received in the overall budget.\nThere was also \u00a334m allocated to waiting lists in May - a long way off from the \u00a3215m that Robin Swann said was required.\nThese figures do not address what's required to cover pay deals next year, which is approximately an additional \u00a3200m.\nDespite the money, some services will still be cut - some less \"catastrophic\" than others.\nWe can expect to see fewer domiciliary care packages and hospital beds, and cuts to the number of operating lists.\nWhile there is little wriggle room at the moment for services and staff, there\u2019ll be even less in the future.\nHealth inequalities are already evident in communities across Northern Ireland and this will make a bad situation even worse.\nCritics have argued that the health department needs to produce plans with targets.\nHealth Minister Mike Nesbitt will need to start prioritising and imaginatively thinking outside the box.",
    "The share prices of UK housebuilders jumped on Friday after Labour's landslide victory in the general election saw the party return to power for the first time since 2010.\nVistry, Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Berkeley all finished the day between 2-3% higher on the back of Labour\u2019s plans to build new homes.\nDuring the election campaign, Labour focused largely on tackling housing supply, with a promise to build 1.5 million homes over the next parliament.\nThe party has pledged to reform the planning system, although some have warned that doing so will not be easy.\nIn an interview with the BBC, new Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that planning reform was \"front and centre\" of Labour's plan to grow the economy.\nIn order to build the 1.5 million homes and the energy infrastructure that Labour has committed to, \"we need to change how our planning system works - speed it up, stop the bureaucracies that are tying up investments in red tape,\" she said.\nLabour has also said it will allow development on lower-quality areas in the green belt, dubbed the \"grey belt\".\nAnalysts RBC Capital Markets said in a note that they would be watching to see if the new government's \"walk matches its talk\".\n\"In the very short term we suspect that the talk alone will be enough to lift share prices,\" RBC said.\nHowever, Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said overhauling the planning system is likely to be a \"gradual and tortuous process\".\nThe share price rise comes as the UK's biggest mortgage lender Halifax said mortgage costs are still the biggest challenge facing homebuyers and those coming to the end of fixed-term deals \nHowever, the squeeze caused by higher interest rates is likely to ease gradually as incomes rise and house price growth remains subdued, said Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at Halifax.\nAccording to the lender's latest figures, the average UK house price was relatively flat in June, falling by 0.2% from the previous month.\nThe average house price in the UK stood at \u00a3288,455 last month, the Halifax said, edging down from \u00a3288,931 in May.\nPrices were up 1.6% from a year earlier, echoing recent figures from the Nationwide building society.\nMs Bryden said, however, the market was \"delicately balanced\" and sensitive to how quickly any changes may be made to the Bank of England's base rate.\nThe UK's central bank began to raise its key interest rate in late 2021 in an attempt to tackle soaring inflation. Prices rose as pandemic-related restrictions eased, causing supply chain crunches, and food and energy prices spiked following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nThe Bank's base rate currently stands at 5.25%, the highest level in 16 years. \nHowever, at its last rate-setting meeting, the Bank appeared to hint that it could cut rates at its next meeting on 1 August.\nDespite this, many homeowners coming to the end of a fixed-rate deal are now facing mortgage rates much higher than they have become used to.\nLast week, the Bank said that about three million households are set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years.\nThe current average rate for a two-year fixed deal is 5.93%, although this is lower than last year's peak of 6.86% and major lenders have been cutting rates in recent days.\nIn its latest figures, Halifax said that Northern Ireland saw the fastest regional house price growth, up 4% from a year earlier.\nLondon still has the most expensive property prices, now averaging \u00a3536,306.\nProf Sir John Curtice told the BBC that the general election results highlighted how the Conservatives performed poorly in places where more than one-third of families have a mortgage.\nHe suggested this could be due to the turmoil seen on markets following the mini-budget of September 2022.",

    "The government will announce plans on Friday to release prisoners early to stop jails becoming full in England and Wales, the BBC has confirmed.\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is expected to set out a suite of emergency measures to free up space in prisons.\nThe main measure will be automatically releasing prisoners on \u201cstandard determinate sentences\u201d after they have served 40% of their sentence, government sources confirmed. \nCurrently, they are released after serving 50% of their sentence.\nThere will be exemptions for sexual and serious violent offenders.\nIn March, the then-Conservative government announced plans to release prisoners up to two months early in a bid to ease overcrowding. \nSpeaking to the BBC's Today Podcast, former Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said there were further plans to release some prisoners after 40% of their sentence and to send fewer people to jail in the first place but these were shelved over fears of a lack of support in Parliament.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, currently in Washington DC attending a Nato summit, was asked by reporters what he had discovered about the state of public spending now he\u2019s in office.\n\u201cSome of what we\u2019ve found is shocking, not so much about the finances, but I have to say, on prisons,\" he said.\n\u201cThe situation is worse than I thought it was. I\u2019m pretty shocked that it\u2019s been allowed to get into that situation. It\u2019s reckless to allow them to get into that place.\u201d\nLast week the Prison Governors\u2019 Association, which represents 95% of prison governors in England and Wales, warned that jails were due to run out of space within days.\nAlex Chalk, who was justice secretary until just last week, when his party lost power in the general election, told the Today podcast one of the reasons behind overcrowding was the Covid pandemic, which saw court cases delayed.\nMr Chalk, who lost his seat at the general election, said he thought more people should be given suspended sentences, rather than custodial sentences, which he said increased the likelihood of reoffending. \nAsked why he didn't implement that when in government, he said: \u201cWe have to remember there are seasons in politics, and it was difficult, as we know, at the end of the last Parliament to be satisfied that you would be able to get things through Parliament.\n\"At the risk of stating the bleeding obvious you\u2019ve got to win votes.\"\nAsked if the then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak blocked the changes because it would be unpopular with MPs, Mr Chalk said he wouldn't go into details of behind-closed-doors discussions but added: \"It is reasonable to say there were a variety of views about what could be got through Parliament.\"\nHe said the new Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood would have to be \"very frank and credible about the long term\". \nReleasing prisoners early would buy the government \"18 months\" he said but added: \"It won't buy you any more than that.\"\nHe added: \"If the situation is that we haven\u2019t got new money, are you seriously going to be saying that instead of building a new hospital, we\u2019re going to be building a new nick at the cost of \u00a3600,000 per cell?\"\nLabour has not yet set out what it will do in the longer term, but Sir Keir's appointment of James Timpson as prisons minister suggests he will pursue a change of approach.\nMr Timpson, the boss of the shoe repair chain which has a policy of employing ex-offenders, said in an interview with Channel 4 earlier this year that \"we're addicted to punishment\u201d and that only a third of prisoners should be there.\nIn Scotland, a scheme to release up to 550 inmates with less than six months left on their sentence is under way.\nHowever this could be extended to include those who have served two-thirds of their sentence. \nLast year, the Scottish Parliament backed a bill which aimed to cut down the prison population by ensuring people were only remanded in custody as a last resort.\nJustice Secretary Angela Constance said the bill would help tackle Scotland's historically high remand rate, but some victims' groups raised concerns it could lead to repeat offenders being released on bail.

    "Airbrushing a picture of yourself is not a crime. \nBut in the case of Reform UK general election candidate Mark Matlock it led to viral - and spurious - claims that he was fake and generated by AI.\nMr Matlock came fifth in Clapham and Brixton Hill last Thursday, and did not turn up to the count because he had pneumonia.\nYet it was his decision to doctor an image of himself, including adding a tie, which fuelled speculation on social media that he was a work of fiction.\n\u201cPeople were very mean online and there\u2019s been a lot of nastiness which is unnecessary,\u201d he told the BBC.\nDespite numerous claims on social media, the BBC has found no evidence that any of Reform\u2019s candidates were fake. \nHowever, a curious number of those standing for seats across the UK come from two small Midlands towns.\nAt least six Reform candidates have ties to Swadlincote in South Derbyshire.\nThey include Alison Devine, a personal assistant to the party\u2019s chief executive, who came second behind Labour\u2019s Graham Stringer in Blackley and Middleton South, Greater Manchester.\nA further three candidates live, or have lived, just 10 miles away in Coalville.\nReform has now conceded that a last-minute rush to find candidates led the party\u2019s staff to recruit their friends and family.\n\u201cWe were desperate\u201d, a party spokesperson told the BBC. \n\u201cBasically it\u2019s friends, relations, office workers.

We spent hardly anything.\u201d\nSo-called \"paper candidates\" -  where a political party selects someone who does no campaigning but appears on the ballot paper - have long been a feature of British elections.\nFor opposition parties this practice is particularly important for amassing \"short money\" - the funds handed out by parliament to help them hold the government to account.\nA party is awarded \u00a322,295.86 for every seat won at the general election plus \u00a344.53 for every 200 votes amassed.\nBefore the election, the Labour Party was entitled to \u00a37,527,952.91 per year in funding. \nParties with five or fewer MPs - like Reform UK - are limited to an annual subsidy of \u00a3376,230 plus further funds to cover travel costs.\nHowever, Nigel Farage\u2019s party argues that their motivation in selecting as many candidates as possible was about democracy not money.\n\u201cPeople deserve the option to vote for us if they so wish,\u201d said a spokesperson.\n\u201cIf they didn\u2019t have a paper candidate, that right is taken from them.

    "To get a sense of the public interest in the Vision Pro, Apple's very high-tech, very expensive virtual reality (VR) headset - finally launched in the UK and Europe on Friday - where better to head than one of its own stores?\nIn the past, people camped outside Apple branches overnight, so desperate were they to get their hands on the tech giant's latest product.\nWhen I went to its branch in central London on Friday morning, though, there was just a small group, mainly comprised of men, waiting for the doors to open.\nPartly, that's because people these days prefer the convenience of pre-orders. \nBut it also perhaps tells us something about the question that continues to hang over the VR headset market: will it ever escape the realm of tech aficionados and go truly mainstream?\nApple's plan to make its product break through is to position it as a product you use to do the stuff you already do \u2013 only better. Home videos become 3D-like, panoramic photos stretch from floor to ceiling, 360 degrees around you. Apple keeps reminding me it calls this \u201cspatial content\u201d. Nobody else does. Plenty suck their teeth at the Vision Pro's price though - a whopping \u00a33,499.\nFacebook owner Meta has been watching Apple\u2019s approach closely. It\u2019s been in the VR game a long time. At a recent demo for the Meta Quest 3, which has been available in the UK since 2023, the team was very keen to talk to me about \u201cmulti-tasking\u201d \u2013 having multiple screens in action at once. In a demo I had a web browser, YouTube and Messenger in a line in front of me. \u201cWe always did this, we just didn\u2019t really talk about it,\u201d one Meta worker told me.\nAnd in its most recent advertisement, a man wears a Quest 3 to watch video instructions while building a crib. Not the most exciting concept, perhaps, but it shows just how Meta wants people to see its tech.\nOh - and it costs less than \u00a3500.\nApple and Meta are the two big players but VR is a crowded market - there are dozens, maybe hundreds, of different headsets already out there. \nBut what unites them all is none have quite hit the mainstream.\nUp until now, the Vision Pro has only been on sale in the US - research firm IDC predicts it will shift fewer than 500,000 units this year.\nMeta, which has been in the market longer, does not release sales data for the Quest either but it's thought to have sold around 20 million worldwide.\nVR headsets are nowhere near as ubiquitous as tablets, let alone mobile phones.\nAnd it gets worse - George Jijiashvili, analyst at market research firm Omdia, said of those devices sold, many are abandoned.\n\u201cThis is largely due to the limited in-flow of compelling content to keep up engagement,\u201d he said.\nBut of course lack of content leads to reduced interest - and a reduced incentive for developers to make that content in the first place.\n\"It's a chicken and egg situation,\" Mr Jijiashvili told the BBC.\nAlan Boyce, the founder of mixed reality studio DragonfiAR, warned that early adopters of the Vision Pro would have to \u201cbe patient\u201d while more content arrived.\nThat's where the Quest 3 wins out for him - it already has a \"robust library\" of games, and it can perform virtual desktop tasks just like the Vision Pro.\nAnd IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo says we should not be too quick to write off a slow start for Apple\u2019s new product.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the expectation that Apple with every single product will sell in the millions straight away, there\u2019s always the comparison with the iPhone,\u201d he said.\nBut the reality is even the iPhone took time to find its feet - and a huge number of buyers.\nAccording to Melissa Otto from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the iPhone only became mainstream when the App Store \"started to explode with apps that added value to our lives\".\n\"When people start to feel their lives are becoming better and more convenient, that's when they're willing to take the leap,\" she said.\nThere is another factor to consider here too though: the physical experience of using a headset.\nBoth Apple and Meta use so-called \"passthrough\" technology to enable what is known as mixed reality - the blending of the real and computer-generated worlds.\nBy utilising cameras on the outside of the headset, users are given a live, high-definition video feed of their surroundings - meaning they can wear it while doing things like walking or exercising.\nBut strapping something to your face weighing half a kilogram is not something that feels particularly natural.

    "\nPictures of children wounded in an attack on a Ukrainian hospital are on most front pages. \"Putin bombs cancer kids\" is the Daily Mirror's headline. The Daily Mail describes the attack as an \"atrocity that shows why Britain and Nato must spend more on defence\".\nThere is another call for an increased military budget in the Times. A former head of the Army, General Sir Patrick Sanders, tells the paper Britain's forces are so worn down that they would be able to fight only a small war, for no longer than a month. He says troop numbers have fallen alarmingly because of funding cuts and ammunition stockpiles are dangerously low. \nThe general also warns that - as he puts it - \"the new axis powers\" or Russia, China and Iran, pose an even more lethal challenge than the Nazi alliance in 1939.\nIn a joint article in the Daily Telegraph, Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Defence Secretary John Healey say the government will increase military spending to 2.5% of the economic output \"as soon as possible\". The also say the UK will be arguing that all Nato countries should adopt that target.\nThe Guardian highlights  what it calls the first major policy announcement by Health Secretary Wes Streeting. He is diverting billions of pounds from hospitals in England to GPs, to help patients access help sooner. Less than 10% of the NHS budget in England is currently spent on primary care - a share that has been falling despite record-high demand at GP surgeries.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is accused by both the Mail the Daily Express of laying the groundwork for tax rises, after she said the public finances were in the worst state since the Second World War. \nThe Mail says the economic circumstance the Conservatives inherited from the last Labour government in 2010 were far worse than where the country is now. In an editorial, the paper says \"we are not in the economic wasteland Ms Reeves likes to pretend\" - and accuses her of using such imagery to justify \"difficult decisions\" that lie ahead.\nThe Telegraph also says an institute founded by former prime minister Sir Tony Blair has predicted that the new government will have to raise an additional \u00a350bn in taxes - unless it finds radical new ways to increase productivity. The report says the money will be needed to stabilise debt, meet the increasing health costs in an ageing society and plug the decreasing tax take from oil and gas, as the country transitions to net-zero. Sir Tony is calling for a greater use of artificial intelligence to boost growth.\nAccording to the Mirror, female jails could be converted to hold men as the UK runs out of male cells. The paper says the option is being considered as Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood prepares to announce emergency measures. The paper quotes the charity Prison Advice and Care Trust, which says many female prisoners pose a very low risk, if released.\nFinally, the Sun says England football fans are fuming that the German referee, Felix Zwayer, has been appointed to officiate the Euro 2024 semi-final between England and the Netherlands on Wednesday. They are asking how he could be neutral given that he clashed with Jude Bellingham in 2021, when the England midfielder was fined for comments he made about the referee.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "When Banksy artwork Season's Greetings appeared on a garage in Port Talbot in 2018 it kicked off a three-year saga that ended in it being removed from the town.\nBut more than five years on it has left a lasting legacy - a vibrant street art community.\n\"There were people doing it anyway,\" said steelworker and street artist Ryan Davies.\n\"But there's no two ways about it - when Banksy turned up in town, that really kicked off a scene here that had been bubbling under.\"\nAnyone paying a visit to the steel town could not help but notice its ever-growing collection of street art - everything from imposing murals to graffiti lettering and tagging.\n\"Port Talbot is renowned for it now,\" said Ryan.\nRyan, a boiler man at the local steelworks for 33 years, began painting on walls over two years ago.\nWhen he is not on shift he can be found painting alongside twin brothers Matthew and Aiden Cole. Together they are known as THEW Creative.\nOn a Friday afternoon they were at Margam Football Club, which had commissioned  them to paint a mural on its clubhouse in the shadow of the steel plant's blast furnaces.\nWith looming mass job cuts at the steelworks, Ryan said it was a welcome distraction from the day job, where people were feeling \"very demoralised\".\n\"With me coming up to 50, I\u2019m lucky enough to have paid off my mortgage... but there\u2019s boys in their twenties there and they\u2019ve just taken on mortgages, they've got young kids and a long way to go before retirement - so for them it\u2019s very, very nerve-wracking,\" he said. \nRyan said having colourful street art around the town was a hopeful sight during difficult times. \n\"It makes you think the town might actually have a chance and it's not just about the steelworks,\" he added.\n\"[The Banksy] made the common person realise that it's not just anti-social, art is art,\" said Aiden. \n\"People started realising \u2018we could have art in our garden, on our children\u2019s bedroom wall, on our football club, on our restaurant - it has really bloomed and there\u2019s a nice scene going on in Port Talbot at the moment.\"\nBut not everyone in Port Talbot is a fan.\n\"We got accused of making the place look like a third world country the other day by a random old man - fair enough,\" said Aiden. \n\"But overwhelmingly it\u2019s a positive reaction, I would say,\" added Ryan.\n\"You can\u2019t please everyone, can you,\" added his friend.\nIt was back in December 2018 when Season\u2019s Greetings appeared on steelworker Ian Lewis\u2019 garage in Taibach, and following online speculation it was soon claimed by the famous anonymous street artist.\nWith an estimated 20,000 visitors flocking to see the artwork, wardens were drafted in to control traffic and film star Michael Sheen, who grew up in the area, helped pay for a protective plastic screen and round-the-clock security.\nIt was eventually bought by gallery owner John Brandler and taken to a building in the town centre so it could be viewed by the public. \nBut once an agreement to keep it there expired Mr Brandler moved it out of Wales in February 2022.\n\"It was a travesty,\" recalled Ryan.\n\"It was taken away from us, a very rich person came in and bought it and off it went.\"\nWhen this was put to Mr Brandler he said he had bought the artwork intending to keep it in the town and create an international street art museum - but the idea had been scrapped by the local council.\nA spokeswoman from Neath Port Talbot council said at the time: \"Discussions were held on the potential for the work to remain in Port Talbot but the council was informed it would have to meet the costs of its removal and installation into a new venue, to continue to cover the insurance and to pay a fee in the region of \u00a3100,000 per year for the loan of the work.\"\nRecalling the dispute, Mr Brandler said: \"I was travelling to Wales virtually every week costing me a day-and-a-half of my business time to have meetings, to be greeted by the phrase that it wasn't going to happen because - and I quote - 'Banksy isn't Welsh'.\"\nHe added he was \"so, so saddened\" that the artwork had not been able to remain in the town which he said was \"in dire need of tourism\".\nThirty miles away in Cardiff, the Banksy effect is also being felt.\nThere, graffiti writer Amelia Thomas, better known as Unity, said: \"People have their own feelings about Banksy, but something that can't be disputed is one thing that Banksy has done is raise the profile of people painting on walls being acceptable.\n\"There's a lot of people in Port Talbot who had already been painting for years and not getting any recognition, so it's a bit barmy that it takes someone from outside to paint something for people to actually appreciate the local people.\"\nAmelia grew up in rural Llanfihangel Talyllyn in Powys, and said she had always been drawn to \"making marks on walls\".\n\"I was getting into trouble because no-one else was doing it and it was quite obviously me,\" she said.\nEverything changed when she saw a graffiti magazine at her cousin\u2019s house.\n\"I was like \u2018Oh, my God, th",

Everyone said he was too small and look what he became over his career.\"\nMr Woodhead said it was \"humbling\" to see what Burrow and his family, together with Sinfield, had achieved in their efforts to fundraise for research into MND. \n\"I think the fundraising will carry on and long may it continue,\" Mr Woodhead added.\n\"Rob never turned anybody away for an autograph, a photograph or a selfie.\n\"In my eyes he was one of the best players in the Super League era.

    "Guernsey Electricity (GEL) has warned customers to expect further price rises so it can pay off current debts and cover the costs of decarbonising the island.\nThe firm said in its annual report new tariff increases would also help meet the costs of maintaining its infrastructure so energy supplies were \"secure and reliable\".\nAccording to its accounts, GEL has more than \u00a329m of bank loans, as well as other debts, that expose it to \"higher debt financing costs\" and \"inflationary pressures\".\nPeter Shaefer, the firm's chairman, said \"significant\" investment was needed and \"further tariff increases will be necessary\".\nThe warning comes after electricity bills rose 10% at the start of this month, having risen 13% in 2023, which the company blamed on under-investment and \"artificially low\" prices in the past.\nGEL said net debt had increased by \u00a34.5m last year because of nearly \u00a313m in additional spending.\nIt said this was a \"cause for concern\" and it needed to \"move to a more sustainable financing model\".\nThe company said a long-standing agreement with France to supply electricity at a fixed cost had nearly halved the price of electricity for people in Guernsey over recent years.\nIt said pressures such as the war in Ukraine had forced prices up in the UK and elsewhere, but Guernsey had been protected from this by the agreement with France.\nHowever, it said the wholesale cost of electricity would rise as that agreement had come to an end.\nAlan Bates, GEL's chief executive, said customers' bills had been \"amongst the lowest in the British Isles\" and the firm performed well compared to Jersey and the Isle of Man, according to a recent review.\nMr Bates said prices would rise so it could start to repay its current high-cost debts, as well as to decarbonise the island and maintain old infrastructure.\nMr Bates said the company was planning to fund its infrastructure investments \"in the most affordable and cost-efficient way\" with a mixture of long-term borrowing and reinvesting profits.\nHe said the firm was \"mindful\" of the \"cost of living pressures on all consumers and remains committed to operating in an efficient manner to minimise costs wherever possible\".\nSpeaking about renewable energy, Mr Bates said only 0.2% of the island's electricity supply came from solar power.\nHe said about 90% of the island's energy came from the underwater cable to France.\n\"Recognising our island's unique challenges, and understanding the importance of using a blend of imported electricity and local renewables, will ensure the island has a secure and resilient supply as we transition towards new energy sources and our net carbon zero targets by 2050,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

The BBC took to the streets of Dewsbury on Friday morning to test his theory.\nIn between packing tomatoes on the fruit & veg stall where she works at the town's market, Rachel Carter told us independent candidates \"understand a lot more about Dewsbury and what Dewsbury needs\".\n\"I think it will be very good,\" the 35-year-old predicted.\n\"Dewsbury has become quite run-down in recent years.

    "Volunteers are set to take part in a 12-day archaeological dig in the hope of finding signs of medieval life on a farm. \nThe excavation at High Tarns Farm in Silloth will begin on 22 July.\nIt will be led by archaeologist Mark Graham and follows his discovery of crop marks on the land, which suggest it was once the site of a large medieval building. \nMr Graham said he was \"excited\" but warned it could be a let down, adding: \"If you're going to be an archaeologist, you better get used to disappointment.\"\nDue to written records, archaeologists have long known that part of the town was once the site of a medieval farm linked to Cistercian monks. \nMr Graham said he noticed crop marks when he was looking at aerial images in 2022.\nCrop marks are made by vegetation drawing on better nutrients and water supplies trapped in long-gone fortification ditches - leading to lush green growth that stands out.\nThe marks looked like a \"footprint of a large timber building\", he said, adding: \"I nearly fell off my chair.\" \nHe suspected the building was timber as the marks corresponded with holes required for large wooden posts to hold up such a structure. \nNo such building is detailed in maps going back to the 1800s, he added, and the  marks suggest the building is about 50m (164ft) long and 20m (66ft) wide.\nMr Graham's two main theories about the potential building are that it was once a barn belonging to the Cistercian farm, or it is even older and was the home of a Viking chieftain. \n\"There have been houses on the scale that we're talking about excavated in Scandinavia but to find such a thing here in Cumbria would be absolutely remarkable,\" he said. \nThe site will be excavated by about 50 volunteers who hope to find signs of medieval life which can date the building. \n\"No-one on the planet can tell us exactly what this is until we do our work,\" he added. \n\"That's the rewarding aspect of the job.\"\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Plans for a new rail service between London and Manchester, after the northern leg of HS2 was scrapped, have been announced.\nLondon Northwestern Railway is hoping to extend its existing service - which runs from the capital to Crewe - to Manchester Victoria via the West Midlands.\nProposals set to be submitted by the operator see the use of the same track space on the West Coast Main Line that Virgin Trains and Lumo have announced open access bids for.\nA decision on which services can be launched will be made by the Department for Transport and regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR).\nIf London Northwestern Railway's application is approved, new direct links from Rugeley, Lichfield, Tamworth and Atherstone in the West Midlands to Manchester city centre and Warrington would be introduced from summer 2026.\n \"This proposal puts passengers at the heart of the railway and is the common sense solution to increase connectivity between the North West and the West Midlands following the cancellation of the northern leg of HS2,\" said Ian McConnell, managing director of London Northwestern Railway-owner West Midlands Trains.\n\"With platform space at Euston at a premium, the best way to provide new journey opportunities to Manchester is simply to extend existing services, rather than trying to squeeze more trains onto the congested West Coast Main Line.\"\nThe rail provider is also proposing to begin running trains to Manchester Airport by extending its existing service between Stafford and Crewe.\nIn October last year, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak cancelled the plan to extend HS2 between the West Midlands and Manchester amid spiralling costs.\nMost train operators in England - including London Northwestern Railway - are paid a management fee, with the UK Government holding responsibility for costs and revenue.\nOpen access operators receive no taxpayer-funded subsidies and take on all revenue risk.\nThere are concerns that these services create additional strain on the rail network and take too much revenue away from conventional operators.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "France is voting in one of its most significant elections in years, with the far right hoping for a historic victory, but with political stalemate the more likely result.\nThis is the first time the anti-immigration National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella has had a realistic chance of running the government and taking outright control of the National Assembly.\nBut after the RN\u2019s first-round victory last Sunday, more than 200 rival candidates dropped out to give others a better chance of defeating the far right.\nVoting ends at 20:00 (18:00 GMT) and by midday turnout was 26.63%, marginally up on the first round and the highest figure in a parliamentary vote since 1981.\nWhatever the result, it is difficult to see President Emmanuel Macron coming out of this well.\nFour weeks ago, he said it was the responsible solution to call a snap vote in response to the RN\u2019s victory in European elections, minutes after the party\u2019s 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella challenged him to do so.\nIt is not yet clear if there will be another presidential address after the exit polls come out when voting ends on Sunday evening.\nThe two-round election came as a shock to a country gearing up for the start of the Paris Olympics on 26 July. Security was already tight and now 30,000 police have been deployed for a period of heightened political tension.\nThere are fears of violence in Paris and other French cities, whatever the outcome of the vote, and a planned protest outside the National Assembly on Sunday evening has been banned.\nIn Dreux, a historic old town on the road to Normandy, Sunday\u2019s vote fell on the day the Olympic flame was passing through. \u201cFor us it\u2019s a massive thing, bigger than the election,\u201d says Pauline in the tourist office.\nThe flame has been travelling around France for almost two months, and Dreux is holding a weekend of festivities to mark its arrival.\n\u201cMacron should have waited until after the Olympics,\u201d Dreux resident Antoine told the BBC.\nVeteran commentator Nicolas Baverez believes the president has not just blown up his term in office and opened the gates of power wide for the far right. \u201cHe\u2019s compromised the running of the Paris 2024 Olympics, which could deliver a final blow to France\u2019s credit and its image,\u201d he wrote in Le Point on the eve of the vote.\nThe constituency that includes Dreux is one of the races to watch in the second round of this election. \nCandidates such as Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have already won their seats, by winning more than half the vote. But another 500 contests are being decided in run-offs, mostly involving either two or three candidates.\nFormer conservative cabinet minister Olivier Marleix was beaten in the first round by far-right candidate Olivier Dubois. They both qualified for the run-off, along with a candidate from the left-wing New Popular Front, which is in second place nationally.\nBut because Nadia Faveris was narrowly beaten into third by her conservative rival, she pulled out of the race \u201cto block National Rally\u201d.\nOne voter, Morgan, was sceptical that anything would change in the town, whoever won.\nThere have been 217 of these withdrawals across France, including 130 Popular Front candidates and 81 from the president\u2019s Ensemble alliance.\nAnd that has dramatically changed the balance of this pivotal general election.\nThere are 577 seats in the French parliament and projections after Sunday\u2019s first round gave the RN a fighting chance of securing an outright majority of 289. However, final opinion polls on Friday suggested that was out of reach, with 205 to 210 seats as a potential maximum.\nThe parties trying to block an RN victory range from the radical left, Communists and Greens to the Macron centrists and conservatives. They say they are defending the country from the extreme policies of the far right.\nNational Rally has watered down many of its plans but still wants to give French citizens \u201cnational preference\u201d over immigrants for jobs and housing. It aims to abolish the right of automatic citizenship to the children of immigrants who have spent five years aged 11 to 18 in France. It also wants to bar dual nationals from dozens of sensitive jobs.\nOpinion polls are not necessarily reliable. Each of the 500 races is a local contest and voters do not follow recommendations from political parties.\nIf the RN managed upwards of 250 seats, it might seek out allies to form a minority government. President Macron's party had to make do with similar numbers until he became frustrated with his limited ability to pass reforms in parliament.\nThat kind of RN government is unlikely, believes Prof Armin Steinbach of HEC business school in Paris. It would soon face a vote of no confidence, he believes, and under the constitution, France cannot have another general election for at least another year.\nAnother potential scenario is a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that would involve most of the other parties, except for the radical France Unbowed (LFI) party, which the Ma",
    "Debt-laden Thames Water has said it has enough cash to fund its operations until the end of May next year but that efforts to raise new money are continuing.\nThe UK's largest water company, which is facing questions over whether it can survive, said its debts had risen to \u00a315.2bn in the year to March.\nThames has also faced fierce criticism for its environmental record, and the company said the number of sewage discharges more than doubled last year.\nLater this week, the water regulator Ofwat is due to publish its draft ruling on how much water companies can charge their customers for the next five years.\nThere has been speculation that Thames, which serves 16 million customers in London and the Thames Valley region, might have to be taken over by the government if it runs out of money.\nThe company says it has funding of \u00a31.8bn, which is enough for it to keep going until May 2025.\nThames reported an increase in annual profits to \u00a3157.3m, but boss Chris Weston said the company was facing a difficult time, with strengthening its financial position \"a critical priority\".\nThames wants Ofwat to let it raise consumer bills by up to 44% between 2025 and 2030, with extra money promised for investment in environmental measures.\nOn Thursday, the regulator will release its initial ruling on how much water companies can raise bills. There will then be several months of negotiations before a final ruling in December.\nThames said it would be talking to potential investors and lenders following Ofwat's draft ruling, but it added this was not expected to be concluded until after the regulator's final decision.\nAn earlier plan put forward by the company was rejected by the regulator, which led to questions over the firm's future as shareholders at Thames' parent firm, Kemble Water, subsequently withdrew a proposed cash injection into the company.\nAs well as its financial woes, Thames has also come in for steady criticism for the number of sewage discharges and water leaks affecting its customers.\nMr Weston, who joined Thames in January, said the company's performance in this area was \"not where it should be or where we want it to be\".\nThe number of sewage discharges rose to 16,990 last year from 8,015, which was put down to \"prolonged heavy rainfall\".\nThe 40% increase in rain from the previous year also led to a rise in the number of reportable pollution events to 350 from 331.\nHowever, Thames said it had reduced leakages by 7% to its lowest ever level.\n\nMarlene Lawrence is founder of swimming group, the Teddington Bluetits, in south-west London.\nShe says the group is concerned about water pollution in the River Thames and \"swim mindfully\".\n\"I check [the water quality] daily,\" she told BBC Breakfast.\nThe river is used by many different water groups, such as canoe clubs, which is why the quality of the water is so important, she says.\n\"People send their children to learn to row and to canoe and they won\u2019t if they know the river quality is bad. This is so important.\"\nThames' results showed that it paid two dividends worth a total of \u00a3158.3m to two of its holding companies in March this year.\nHowever, the company's chief financial officer, Alastair Cochran, said the payments were for top-up payments to pension schemes, adding they were  \"entirely consistent with normal practice\".\nIn March this year, Mr Weston said it was \"eventually possible\" that the firm could be nationalised.\nIn Thames' latest results, he said: \"I continue to believe that a market-led solution that increases financial resilience is in the best interests of all stakeholders.\"\nHowever, he added this was \"dependent on securing a final regulatory determination that is deliverable, financeable and investable, as well as affordable for our customers\".\nCommunities Minister Jim McMahon said on Tuesday there was \"no programme of nationalisation for the water industry\".\nHowever, he added there was \"no provision in law for a water company to stop providing water\".\n\"We need to be very clear there is always a contingency in place.\"\nMr McMahon added: \"The days of putting shareholder interest above the national interest, frankly, can't carry on and so we do need to look at that and Thames do need to look at their own house and get it in order.\"\nIf Thames does come under government control, there has been speculation it would be put into a Special Administration Regime, which would see financial consultants run the company on the government's behalf.\nA precedent for this was set in 2021 when energy company Bulb went bust and was placed under special administration.\nRegardless of what happens to Thames, water suppliers to its customers will continue as normal.",
    "The victim of an assault by an Irish soldier has said his dismissal from the armed forces would be the \"bare minimum\" outcome.\nCathal Crotty, 22, received a suspended sentence in June for violently attacking 24-year-old Natasha O\u2019Brien in a Limerick street two years ago.\nMs O'Brien said if she didn't speak out about the assault \"nothing would have happened\".\nThe judge in the case, who has since retired, said the suspended sentence would help preserve Crotty\u2019s \u201ccareer\u201d.\nCrotty is to be discharged from the Defence Forces at 23:59 local time on Thursday, according to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, Ms O'Brien said: \u201cIf I didn't scream and shout, nothing would have happened and most victims don't have that energy.\u201d\nShe said she learned that Crotty was to be discharged after the media contacted her for a response.\n\u201cThe general consensus was \u2018that's great'. Is it? It's the bare minimum.\n\u201cIt's absolutely heartbreaking that this amount of national outcry\u2026 complete outrage has called for this.\n\u201cThere are other victims that are suffering inside, watching their attackers live out their happy careers in the forces in, in sports, in any life in general.\"\nIn a statement on Thursday the Irish Defence Forces said it could \"confirm that Private Crotty will be discharged later today\".\nCrotty initially lied to Garda\u00ed (Irish police), telling them he had been attacked first, before changing his story when confronted with CCTV. \nHe also boasted about the attack on Snapchat in the aftermath.\nThe case caused a national uproar when Ms O\u2019Brien came forward to criticise how she had been treated.\nDuring the court process, after she read out her victim impact statement detailing her extensive head injuries and mental anguish, a senior Irish Defence Forces officer told the court that Crotty was a well-mannered member of the army.\nIt was later revealed that 68 serving members of the defence forces have criminal convictions or are before the courts.\nNow senior ministers and the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) have openly criticised the armed forces for their lack of action on those with criminal convictions.\nMs O'Brien has also called for an overhaul of how the Irish Defence Forces deal with criminal convictions.\n\u201cIn dealing with my own individual perpetrator, that is merely a deflection of all the other issues that they also need to address,\" she said. \n\"It needs to be completely reformed.\u201d\nOn Wednesday the Social Democrats party tabled a motion on zero tolerance for gender-based violence at the Irish parliament.\nTheir leader, Holly Cairns, said she is not confident the government will act.\n\u201cI think the situation in the defence forces actually epitomises the half-hearted approach by government because it's replicated throughout society with the lack of regulations in lots of sectors,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe have a situation now whereby Cathal Crotty has been discharged on account of the serious convictions he has. \n\"And then we have a situation where we know there are a number of other people in exactly the same situation except they're still in uniform because it hasn't been in the glare of the media spotlight.\"\nMs Cairns said the fact that it takes a \"media spotlight\" for action to be taken \"is an indictment of the defence forces and the government\".\nA spokesperson for the Irish Defence Forces told the BBC News NI: \u201cThe Defence Forces unequivocally condemns any actions by serving personnel that are contrary to military regulations or that do not reflect our values. \n\"The Defence Forces does not comment on the specifics of individual cases.\u201d",
    "When Phil Booth realised one of the privileges of his student card was discounted access to Edinburgh\u2019s golf courses, he could never have imagined it would tee up a lifelong obsession.\nBut as the retired paediatrician holed his final putt at Tiree\u2019s Vaul club on Sunday, he joined an elite band of players to complete a round on every one of Scotland\u2019s 572 registered courses.\nThe 69-year-old, who lives in Aberdeen, has come a long way from the \u00a31 fee he paid to play at the capital\u2019s Craigmillar course while studying at the University of Edinburgh in the early 1970s.\nHe celebrated the feat with a glass of champagne alongside his family almost 20 years on from starting his official challenge.\nMr Booth, originally from Stockton-on-Tees, said it was his wife Anne\u2019s idea to play all of Scotland\u2019s courses following a holiday to Arisaig in September 2004.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \"She came with me to the nine-hole course at Traigh and we walked up the hill to be greeted with this amazing view of Rum, Eigg and Mull.\n\"She said we never would have seen that if I had not been golfing. We basically used it as an excuse to see parts of Scotland we might have otherwise missed.\n\"Anne even got me a big map of Scotland to stick pins in at all the courses I hadn\u2019t played, so I could choose my entire route.\"\nMr Booth, who is a member at Cruden Bay and Royal Aberdeen, retrospectively counted that he had played about 90 courses following his round at Traigh.\nHe later found an old VisitScotland golf guide which listed all of its registered clubs across the country.\nHe began ticking off clubs on work trips to Edinburgh and Glasgow as well as drives home to visit his family in Teesside, often breaking up the trip with rounds on the way.\nThey have spanned 159 nine-hole courses, 412 18-holes and one 12-hole round.\nAnd the challenges range from an \"absolute mudbath\" on the Isle of Shiel to the iconic Old Course at St Andrews.\nMr Booth said Carnoustie, which hosted the last of its eight Open championships in 2018, and Loch Lomond stood out among his favourite courses to play.\nBut it was Kingussie, nestled in the shadow of the Cairngorms, that gave him one of the most striking memories.\n\"I got there quite early one morning and the steward was the only person at the course,\" he recalled.\n\"He gave me a coffee and took me round the course before I went out and played. \n\"He asked me what I wanted when I got back to the clubhouse and I said a pint of Best.\n\"I remember finishing the ninth and turning round and seeing just the most spectacular view of the mountains.\n\"I got back to the clubhouse and there was a pint sitting on the bar waiting for me. \n\"It was perfect, the people that you meet through golf, their generosity is amazing.\u201d\nHowever, it is unclear whether Mr Booth\u2019s achievement is out of the ordinary or par for the course.\nThe exact number of courses in Scotland is up for debate, with estimates putting it anywhere between 550 and 585.\nBBC Scotland contacted both VisitScotland and Scottish Golf, but neither could provide an official register of all the country\u2019s courses.\nThe European Golf Association lists 560 active courses in its 2023 participation report.\nIn 2006, amateur golfer Ernie Payne completed what he believed to be the full set of 578.\nBack then, VisitScotland put the total at 563, though some had been lost to closures in between Mr Payne beginning and ending his challenge.\nMr Booth lowered his handicap to 12 during the peak of his challenge, but admitted it has gradually crept up to 16 over the years.\nBut the attempt has been less about the quality of the play and more about the trips surrounding the round.\n\"I have played a few of the courses with my son Jonathan and my daughter, Katy, was there on Tiree for the final one,\u201d he said.\n\"They have grown up around it. We have had these trips to the islands, but we have be there for three or four days around that.\n\"It has been worth it for all of those trips.\"",
    "Most people will know all about the Salvation Army and their tireless charity work.\nMaybe you have fond memories of one of its bands playing at a summer fete or performing Christmas carols in your town centre?\nBut few will probably have heard of the Salvation Navy.  \nBecause, believe it or not, there was briefly such an organisation - and it all started in Wales.\nIn 1884, Salvation Army founder William Booth expressed a desire to take his evangelism to the sea.\nIn what many described as a piece of divine providence, at the same time Welsh industrialist John Cory was looking to offload a steam yacht he\u2019d bought for his wife - a vessel she was too nervous to sail.\nCory offered the SS Iole to Booth and the Salvation Navy was born.\nDirector of the Salvation Army\u2019s International Heritage Centre Steven Spencer explained that, whilst an extraordinarily generous act of regifting, Cory nevertheless had his own motivations.\n\u201cJohn Cory\u2019s family gave their name to the hugely successful South Wales Brass band, and that in itself is significant,\" he said.\n\u201cWe have no reason to doubt his devout faith, but through such acts, this coal-broker and ship-owner tried to cement his reputation and instil in his workers a way of life which kept them sober and productive.\u201d\nSo, in June 1885, SS Iole left Cardiff's Bute Dock for Shoreham Harbour in Sussex where she underwent a refit in preparation for her August launch as the Salvation Navy flagship.\nHer three new masts flew the Salvation Army colours of red, blue and yellow, alongside flags bearing the words \u201cAre You Saved?\u201d and \u201cHoliness Unto the Lord\u201d.\nThe use of a pleasure yacht for an evangelical mission did not go unremarked though.\nShe was described in the Salvation Army newspaper The War Cry as \"A little gem, perfect in all her appointments\" and \"almost too luxurious for salvationists\".\n\u201cWe fancy our comrades have little use for the pier-glass and sofas which adorn the cabins, but the piano fitted to the saloon can hardly come amiss to them,\u201d the paper added.\nWith a crew of five, under the command of former Hartlepool lifeboat skipper Captain Sherrington Foster, SS Iole spent the next year visiting the south coast of England from Cornwall to Kent, The Isle of Wight and the Channel Isles.\nTheir mission statement was to: \u201cHurry up after every poor blue jacket who has not another friend in the world, and rush in with salvation to every fisherman\u2019s boat and every bargeman\u2019s keel.\u201d\nBut from the very outset, the Salvation Navy was beset with levels of seafaring bad luck worthy of Only Fools & Horses' Uncle Albert.\n\u201cBy the summer of 1886, the SS Iole was conducting an evangelical campaign in East Anglican ports, including Lowestoft in May and Ipswich in June,\" said Steven Spencer. \n\"Disaster then struck as they were sailing to hold a series of meetings with Salvationists in Hull.\n\u201cOn the evening of 11 June 1886, the ship struck a sandbank in the Humber, possibly snagging on wreckage of a ship that had run aground a few weeks earlier. \n\"It began taking on water and the crew had to escape on the lifeboat and row ashore.\n\u201cThe next morning it was reported that, 'at dead low water, only two or three feet of her funnel were to be seen\u2019.\u201d\nNevertheless, John Cory once again came to the rescue and this time conjured up an even more formidable ship.\nIt was an 82ft (24.9m) racing yacht which became known as the Salvation Gun-Boat.\nShe underwent a refit costing \u00a3120 at Southampton and was equipped with a meeting room below deck which could hold over one hundred Salvationists.\nAlthough, having seemingly not learnt their lesson, the Sally Navy once again didn\u2019t take as much care over their choice of skipper.\nRecords show its captain Abbot Taylor as having a somewhat underwhelming CV, in which he was merely described as \"a former Torbay fisherman\".\nBut the crew set about an even more concerted campaign to win hearts and minds.\n\u201cOver Christmas 1887 The Vestal put in to Bute Dock (Cardiff), where it had all begun,\"  said Mr Spencer.\n\u201cThey attempted converting men by appealing to their own interests, organising events such as bicycle stunt displays.\u201d\nThe celebration was a huge success, but less than two months later The Vestal had befallen the same fate as its predecessor - colliding with another craft on the London's Thames river and damaged beyond repair.\nWith John Cory\u2019s patience seemingly run out, the idea of the Salvation Navy having its own fleet was later wound up.\nHowever, according to Hilary Carey, professor of Imperial and Religious History at the University of Bristol, the venture did at least spawn many privateer Christian missions amongst other sailors.\n\u201cThe movement to create national institutions to cater specifically for sailors\u2019 physical and spiritual needs was one outcome,\" said Prof Carey.  \n\u201cThese organisations together significantly contributed to maritime welfare during the 19th century. \n\"Their collective legacy endures today in continued efforts to support the wellbeing of sea",
    "People on either side of the debate on sex-based rights and gender recognition have told the BBC that political parties' stance on these issues would decide how they voted on 4 July. \nLouise, 53, from Buckinghamshire, said she wanted \"protection for single sex spaces\", particularly in areas like prisons, changing rooms and sport.\nWhile Aqua Moye, 21, from Hertfordshire said they wanted an incoming government to adopt gender recognition legislation which matches that passed by Scotland.\nThe BBC is hearing about what matters to the electorate, as part of Your Voice Your Vote.\nLouise would like any incoming government to amend the Equality Act 2010, to specify that existing legal protections around sex applied to \"biological sex\" so that certain spaces were restricted to those whose sex at birth was female.\nShe believed it was important to protect \"women's privacy, dignity and safety\".\nLouise said she grew up knowing that women in the 60s and 70s had fought for their rights in terms of the workplace, contraceptive and economic freedoms. \n\"My friends and I were aware that women could not open a bank account in their own name,\" she said.\nShe does remember \"a time when it felt like the fight was over\", citing women in the 80s who were seen to \"break the glass ceiling\" but now believes \"advances women have fought long and hard for are being rolled back\".\nShe is opposed to Labour's announcement last year on gender recognition.\nThe plans aim to speed up the process for those wanting to legally change their sex. \nWhile she has previously always voted for Labour, Louise said she now \"cannot vote for them\".\nShe is also \"deeply concerned\" by the party's treatment of the Labour MP for Canterbury, Rosie Duffield, who believes you can change gender identity but you \"never change sex\".\n\"It's been shocking,\" Louise said.\nThis issue has left her \"politically homeless\" and she now does not know who she will vote for.\nShe said although she disagreed with the Conservatives on many issues, she supported the work done by Kemi Badenoch in her role as Minister for Women and Equalities in implementing the recommendations of the Cass Review.\nAqua Moye, 22, who identifies as transgender and non-binary, would like to see an incoming UK government pass a Gender Reform Bill which allows for \"self-ID\", adopting the law passed by the Scottish Parliament.\nUnder current UK rules, people who want to change legal sex need to provide a medical report - but the Scottish law does not require that. \nIn practice though, there has been no change in Scotland, because the UK government has blocked the implementation of the law.\nAqua said the reason they oppose medical certification is because of how long the process takes due to the very limited number of clinics for people with gender dysphoria.\n\"I'm currently on a waiting list, I joined two years ago, and it could take eight to 10 years before I am seen,\" they said.\nThey said they knew of people who joined the queue in 2016 and were only now receiving treatment, \"and with more people being referred, the waiting list is growing\".\nThis delay has pushed them into trying to find a private clinic.\nAqua said the result of not being able to see a specialist and begin the journey to legally change sex has had \"a massive impact\" on their mental health, and left them feeling depressed.\nThey said they were aware of many trans people who have resorted to buying hormones online because of the length of time it takes to get treatment, which can be extremely dangerous.\nAs a first time voter, Aqua said this issue would ultimately decide which party they choose to vote for.\nThey said they were \"disappointed\"in Labour's policy on gender recognition, which sees it drop its 2019 manifesto commitment to introduce self-ID.\nWhile the parties most aligned with their views are the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party, Aqua said they did not believe either were likely to form the next government.\nThe Conservatives said gender recognition would remain a power reserved to the UK government, so that devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland cannot introduce their own system. \nIt added that it would be \"guided by biology, not ideology\" and would maintain the existing need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and proof that an individual has lived in their acquired gender for two years. \nThe party would not allow gender identity to be taught in schools and would prevent children from \"medically transitioning\", for example by taking puberty blockers.\nLabour has dropped its plans to introduce self-ID, and would still require a medical diagnosis in order to obtain a gender recognition certificate. \nBut it has said it would \"streamline and simplify\" the system and would scrap the need for proof of living in the acquired gender in favour of a \"two-year reflection period\". \nThe party said it would maintain \"single-sex exemptions\" to protect women-only spaces, but has not confirmed whether or not it would permi",
    "New measures are being brought in to tackle a town's problem landlords and tenants.\nExtra powers have been granted in two areas of Blyth to deal with poor quality housing and anti-social behaviour.\nIt requires all landlords in the Croft and Cowpen wards to apply for a licence before they are able to rent out their property, Northumberland County Council said.\nDeputy council leader Richard Wearmouth said some residents made life \"hell\" for the town\u2019s law-abiding population.\nThe Conservative-led authority approved a selective licensing scheme, which is used by councils to tackle private landlords who are not meeting their legal obligations, alongside tenants engaging in anti-social behaviour.\nLocal authorities including Durham and Newcastle also have the scheme, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nCouncil leader Glen Sanderson said: \"Being a bad landlord can extend to tenancy management.\n\"The council will not stand\u00a0by and allow residents to live in properties of low standards. \n\"When landlords don\u2019t obtain references allowing a culture of anti-social behaviour - this will tackle that.\"\nThe report said there was a \"clear link\" between poor housing and inequalities - with people living in poor quality homes twice as likely to have poor general health than those who do not.\nMen living in the Croft ward have the lowest life expectancy and healthy life expectancy in the county, while Cowpen has the lowest figures for women.\nMr Wearmouth said problem landlords and tenants needed to be tackled as part of the town's regeneration or \"we put everything that we seek to achieve at risk\".\n\"It's a very small handful of people who make life hell, not just for neighbours on their street, but also in terms of their behaviour when they spend time in the town centre,\" he added.\nIt is hoped by the third year of the scheme, there will be a reduction in property disrepair, anti-social behaviour and crime, contributing to reducing deprivation in the area.\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

It can cause forgetfulness, tiredness and a lack of concentration and can take a couple of weeks before a full recovery.\nOn Princess Anne's visit, the RDA's chief executive Michael Bishop said the association was \"delighted that she has chosen to join us as she returns to royal duties\".\nThe King's sister became patron of the RDA in 1971 and then its president in 1986.\nMr Bishop said: \"As our president, the princess holds a very special place in the hearts of the entire RDA community and has helped us celebrate many significant milestones and provided invaluable support for over five decades.\"\nPrincess Anne is the third working royal to temporarily step back from public duties this year because of health issues.\nThe King and Princess of Wales stepped back from public engagements at the start of the year.

    "A fraudster who scammed a blind man out of \u00a3185,000 has been jailed.\nMark Stanner, 42, of Macclesfield, Cheshire, used a call centre as a front to bombard his victim with phone calls, texts and emails falsely claiming he owed to companies over a four-year period, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.\nThe force said in one instance he had threatened to take the man's property if he did not pay \u00a34,000 within the hour. \nStanner, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, was jailed for five years and four months at Manchester Crown Court Minshull Street. \nPolice said Stanner began his scam by sending messages to the victim, a man in his 50s, claiming he owed funds to publication companies for adverts to advertise his trade as a piano tuner. \nThe initial financial demands which date back to 2017 were small, the force said.\nGMP said the victim paid the demands at first and requested Stanner leave him alone.\nHowever, police said the demands got progressively more aggressive and frequent.\nBecause of the amounts of money Stanner was demanding, the victim had to borrow money from friends and family as he needed to purchase braille software to read a string of invoices Stanner had falsely created.\nPolice said in some instances Stanner gave the victim half an hour to pay his demands.\nGMP said Stanner was gambling with his ill-gotten gains he had fleeced from his victim.\nStanner's sister Martina Turner put \u00a331,000 of the victim\u2019s money into her account to mask her brother's crimes, police said,\nThe 44-year-old of Nelson Drive, Droylsden, was given an 18-month suspended sentence and ordered by undertake 200 hours of unpaid work after admitting conspiracy to defraud. \nMarvin Scott , 41, of Orwell Avenue, Manchester, was jailed for 31 months after he allowed \u00a348,000  from the company to move through his bank accounts to conceal the finances for Stanner.

Mr Stafford recorded 36.1% of votes cast which meant 15,025 ballots for him.\nLIVE: UK general election - latest results and updates\nLIVE: South Yorkshire results come in as Labour make gains\nA night at the counts in Sheffield and Rotherham \nThe winner paid tribute to Mr Stafford, saying although they \"may disagree on a lot, I never doubt that he worked incredibly hard\".\nVoters in what was previously Don Valley, now renamed and reshaped as Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme, dispensed with Tory Nick Fletcher.\nThe outspoken Mr Fletcher, who during his tenure had said a female Dr Who robbed boys of a role model, came second with 12,811 votes - a decrease in share of nearly 20%.\nWinner Lee Pitcher polled 15,122 or 38.6% of votes cast.\nFollowing the announcement, Mr Fletcher, who had been the first Tory MP in Doncaster, warned residents to \u201cbe careful\u201d of what he saw as a future of socialism across the country.\nIn Barnsley, Labour saw off what was expected to be a stiff challenge from Reform.\nPolling had suggested a close race in Barnsley North and Barnsley South, but in the end it was comfortable for Labour.\nDan Jarvis, who had been MP for Barnsley Central before it became Barnsley North scooped a majority of 7,811 by attracting 18,610 votes to Reform's 10,799.\nPosting on X, the former South Yorkshire mayor, said: \"Reports of my demise had been greatly exaggerated...\"\nIn Barnsley South, Stephanie Peacock recorded more than 46% of the vote to poll 16,399.\nReform's David White came second with 11,651.\nMs Peacock said her party's win was a \"reflection of 14 years of a chaotic Conservative government\".\nIn Sheffield Hallam, Labour's Olivia Blake secured 23,875 votes compared to challenger and city Lib Dem leader Shaffaq Mohammed's 15,686.\nThis gave her a majority of 8,189 - up from 712 in 2019.\nShe said her win celebrated the end of \u201c14 years of Conservative vandalism\u201d.\nLabour cantered to victory with solid majorities across the rest of the city.\nIn Rotherham, Sarah Champion was re-elected with a majority of about 5,500 votes over second-place Reform.\nin Doncaster North, former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who accrued 16,231 votes against the Conservative candidate in second on 7,105, said he was delighted with the picture locally and nationally.\nHe said Labour had received an \"historic mandate\".\nMr Miliband said people on the doorstep had expressed fear whether any party could \"turn the country around\".\nHe said Labour's job was now to \"show people that they can deliver\".\n",
    "Students and graduates suing University College London (UCL) over the quality of teaching during strikes and Covid lockdowns will see their cases move to trial at the start of 2026.\nAround 5,000 students have brought claims against UCL, after teaching was moved online or cancelled.\nTheir lawyers called on the university to make \"sensible settlement proposals\" and avoid going to trial.\nUCL said it prioritised students' wellbeing and \"educational achievements\".\nThe cases against UCL are the first to go to court but current and former students are seeking compensation from other universities too.\nLawyers are offering representation for students at UK universities who sign up via a website called Student Group Claim. \nThey say more than 155,000 people have signed up  - although that does not necessarily mean all of them will seek payouts through the courts.\nThe students who are seeking compensation argue that cancelled and online teaching restricted their access to facilities and damaged the quality of teaching.\nDavid Hamon, 29, the lead claimant in the cases against UCL, began his campaign for compensation while he was a Master\u2019s student there in 2020-21.\nHe told the BBC in an interview last month that he paid \u00a314,000 for his international politics degree, which ended up being entirely online.\nSeminars intended for discussion were held on video calls, he said, during which \u201cno-one spoke\u201d and some people had their cameras off altogether.\nMr Hamon said the claim was about \u201cconsumer rights\u201d.\n\u201cWe purchased something and it's clear that what we got was not what we bought,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOnline degrees are less expensive than in-person degrees and that's because the costs are lower and the standard is lower,\u201d he added.\nThe law firms representing the students - Harcus Parker and Asserson - argued in a case management hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice last month for a group litigation order, which would have allowed all the claims against UCL to be processed as one single claim.\nThat request has now been dismissed.\nInstead, a few students representing a variety of experiences and scenarios will be selected as \"test cases\" for the trial.\nThe judgements reached on these cases will help determine how the other UCL students' claims are settled.\nShimon Goldwater, a lawyer at Asserson, said: \"The students we represent would welcome sensible settlement proposals from UCL so that this matter does not need to proceed to trial.\u201d\nMatthew Patching, a lawyer at Harcus Parker, said settlements would be a better route  than \"continuing to fight this claim through to the end\".\nUCL said it needed more information about the individual claims.\nIt has previously said students should use internal procedures to complain.\n\nProf Kathy Armour, vice provost at UCL, said the university had offered an alternative dispute resolution process which was \"flatly rejected by the claimants' lawyers\".\n\"Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, we prioritised the health and safety of our whole community and followed UK government guidance, working tirelessly to make our campus and all UCL premises as safe as possible so that a high-quality academic experience could continue to be provided,\" she said.\nIn a ruling, High Court judge Senior Master Cook said test cases would be identified at the next case management hearing, which will take place in November.\nHe also asked lawyers representing the students to provide more details of the students' claims, including their names, student numbers and course details.",
    "One in five care homes in England is now rated \"requires improvement\" or \"inadequate\" by the watchdog the Care Quality Commission (CQC). In one home, a resident fell 32 times in only 11 months. The new Labour government says it wants to set minimum standards for social care as well as pay and conditions for carers.\nThe BBC has been speaking to three people with experience of life in care homes to hear what they think needs to change for standards to improve.\nAshleigh Joachim's mother Pat was in her 60s when she was diagnosed with dementia. \nWhen the disease progressed and Pat moved into a care home, both Ms Joachim and her sister Lesley Haswell, from Sunderland, were determined their mother would receive the best care available. The home they chose was rated \"good\".\nSo, when they noticed a decline in what they call \"the basics\" - Pat being clean, comfortable and well fed - they pointed it out to staff. \n\"We noticed my mother was in dirty clothes with unclean teeth, nails with faeces in, not helped to feed, upset a lot of the time,\" Ms Joachim said.\n\"We'd complain to the staff but things weren\u2019t improving - they were deteriorating.\"\nThe sisters started keeping a log and looked at their mother's care files, which they said were not always accurate. \nAt that point, care home staff were \"very clearly unhappy we were complaining\" and seemed resentful, Ms Joachim said.\nThe family escalated their complaints until Pat was moved to another care home where, Ms Joachim said, the same cycle began again.\n\"It was decent for a few months, then the manager left and the care deteriorated,\" she said.\n\"Mam had a broken nose nobody could explain, she lost 20kg [about three stones] in weight, was left without medication. She was clearly dehydrated and she was dirty.\"\nConcerned they could not be sure their mother was safe, the family moved Pat to yet another home.\n\"Next care home, same thing,\" Ms Joachim said. \"It had a good CQC rating, but she's still dirty and she's losing weight.\n\"The care files are inaccurate. Same cycle, but my mother is getting worse.\"\nOne former care worker at other homes in the north-east of England, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC she received minimal initial training. A lack of staff during her induction meant she felt the pressure to hit the ground running, she said.\n\"We would need to toilet, dress, feed over 50 residents with just six carers, whilst the seniors did the medication rounds,\" she said.\n\"By the time you had finished the bedrooms, done the tea round to make sure residents had plenty of fluids, updated paperwork and toileted residents, it was time for lunch.\"\nThe carer said time pressures and a shortage of staff were compounded by employees suffering assaults on a regular basis.\n\"I have seen staff who have been slapped, punched, hair pulled out and even a fractured skull,\" she said.\n\"I have often had to send a staff member out to cool down.\"\nResidents with dementia would refuse to be changed and staff had no choice but to leave them.\n\"You can\u2019t physically force them, it would be abuse,\" she said. \"So you would just keep going back between other jobs, trying to encourage the resident to let you help. \n\"Meanwhile I have had health professionals and families accuse you of not looking after the resident and leaving them wet.\"\nThe carer was sometimes so uncomfortable with situations she witnessed at work, including patients being forced from their beds, drag-lifting and even a member of staff high on prescription drugs, she decided to raise the alarm.\n\"I did whistleblow, but I was treated like a problem-causer, like I had done something wrong,\" she said.\n\"I left shortly after that.\"\nMike Padgham, who chairs the Independent Care Group which supports care providers, said the vast majority of homes were providing good care but should be open to feedback.\n\"Complaints should be viewed as positive,\" he said.\n\"What provider gets up in the morning to provide poor care? If you raise a problem or whistleblow, you should be encouraged.\"  \nMr Padgham added that a lack of staff was a huge issue across the industry.\n\"Across England, there's 152,000 vacancies,\" he said. \"By 2035, we need 440,000 extra staff in social care.\"\nMr Padgham said he would like to see \"bold\" action from the new government.\n\"We\u2019d like to see wholesale reform including, potentially, care being brought into a national care service, alongside the NHS,\" he said.\nThe former care worker said alleviating the pressure on care home staff was key if the government wanted to change things for the better.\n\"I really liked my role as a carer, I like to think I made the residents' lives better,\" she said.\n\"I left because it is very low pay, very physical and I struggled morally with rushing the care of the residents to keep up with demands of the job.\"\nThe CQC said its main priority was \"to ensure the health and wellbeing\" of care home residents.\n\"This includes listening to what they and their loved ones tell us about services, to h",
    "Strictly Come Dancing star Graziano Di Prima has confirmed that he is leaving the show. \nIn a statement on Instagram, he said he \"deeply regrets\" the events leading up to his departure and acknowledged that his \"intense passion and determination to win might have affected my training regime\".\nA BBC spokesperson confirmed that Di Prima was \"no longer a part of the line-up of professional dancers for the upcoming series\".  \n\"While we would never comment on individual cases, it is well-known that the BBC has established a robust duty of care procedures, and if issues are raised we will always take them seriously and act swiftly as appropriate,\u201d they said.\nDi Prima, 30, first joined the Strictly line-up in 2018 as the partner of radio DJ Vick Hope. \nHe remained part of the show for the following two years, though did not have a celebrity partner, then in 2021 danced with comedian and Loose Women host Judi Love. \nHe returned in 2022 and was paired with actress Kym Marsh, with whom he reached the quarter finals, and last year danced with TV presenter Zara McDermott. \nAway from Strictly, Di Prima has competed in numerous international dance competitions and toured globally with dance company Burn The Floor. \nIn his statement, he said he understood that it was \"best for the show that I step away\". \n\"While there are aspects of this story involving external influences that I can't discuss at this time, I remain committed to being strong for my family and friends,\" he said.\n\u201cI wish the Strictly family and the BBC nothing but success in the future. I also want to thank everyone who has supported my career, both professionally and personally. When the time is right, I will share my story.\u201d\nThe episode is not the first time Strictly - which is among the most watched shows in the BBC line-up - has faced a complaint about the practices of one of its professional dancers. \nLast month, following widely-reported complaints about his teaching methods, the show confirmed that long-standing professional Giovanni Pernice would not be part of the 2024 series. \nPernice had said earlier he was surprised by the allegations and rejected \"any suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour\".",
    "Six Derbyshire schools will share almost \u00a35m to create places for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).\nNew classrooms and refurbished indoor and outdoor spaces are to be created to allow existing schools to accommodate extra SEND pupils.\nThe investment of \u00a34,838,000 signed off by Derbyshire County Council is part of a wider \u00a311m plan to increase the number of SEND places by about 500 over five years.\nCouncillor Alex Dale, cabinet member for education, said: \u201cWe\u2019ll immediately start spending this initial \u00a35 million to create new school places and improve existing provision for children and young people with SEND - particularly those with more complex needs - and for pupils who require alternative provision which will make a significant impact on their early learning.\u201d\nThe council said it is investing in existing schools instead of building new SEND facilities to prevent children having to travel as far for schooling.\nNew classroom buildings are being created at Alfreton Park School, Ashgate Croft School in Chesterfield, while work is also being carried out to allow extra spaces at the existing buildings at Brackenfield SEND School and Stanton Vale School in Long Eaton, Stubbin Wood Nursery in Shirebrook, and Swanwick School and Sports College.\nAreas with the greatest need of extra SEND provision were identified through council consultations with Derbyshire schools.\nIn April, Chesterfield MP Toby Watkins claimed the council had millions of pounds \"sat in the bank\" for school spaces for children with special needs, which it could be spending.\nMr Dale said: \u201cThis is money that can only be spent once, so it needs to be based on detailed work to ensure we provide the right sort of places in the right areas to meet the different demands we face.\n\u201cThis is not easy in a county with a geography like ours and does take time, but we\u2019re making good progress.\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to giving every Derbyshire child the best possible start in life, whatever their challenge or ability.\u201d\nIn addition to creating extra school places, the council said it is also investing in Enhanced Resource Schools, SEND units, and education outside of school settings.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Two men, who tried to flee the country part way through a trial over the death of a man, have been caught at Manchester Airport.\nOsama Saeed, 32, and Asgar Taj, 35, fled in October 2023, during their trial for causing the death of Asad Rashid, 34, who was hit in a street race between two cars and two motorcyclists on the A34 Handforth bypass on 15 September 2020.\nThey previously pled guilty to the charge after dialling into the court from abroad but both men failed to return to court for their sentencing.\nCheshire Police arrested the pair at Manchester Airport on Monday after they travelled to the UK from  Abu Dhabi.\nAppearing at Minshull Street Crown Court on Monday, Saeed, of St Pauls Road, Bradford and Taj, of Heather Grove, Bradford, received 12 years for causing death by dangerous driving.\nA third defendant, Mohammad Zubair Chaudhry, 31 of Kingsway, Cheadle, who also pleaded guilty to the offence, was previously sentenced to 10 years seven months despite being absent from court in December.\nEnquiries to locate him were ongoing, police said.\nDuring the incident, Chaudry was driving an Audi R8 and Saeed was in an Audi RS3, while Taj and Rashid were riding Suzuki motorbikes.\nThe group travelled to Cheshire from Manchester along the A34, as they passed under the A555 bridge all four drivers lined up at the traffic lights ready to race, police said.\nThe level of acceleration put the vehicles out of sight within seconds before they all collided with a roundabout at about 22:10 BST.\nChaudhry's Audi R8 hit first, tearing off the underside of the engine flying through the roundabout to end up 135m (148 yards) further down the A34.\nRashid was struck by the RS3 as it hit the central reservation, became trapped by the vehicle and died at the scene.\nMembers of the public stopped to assist the injured men and as one of them approached Taj as he lay on the roundabout, they noticed he was clearly deleting files from Instagram, before then deleting the app itself in an attempt to destroy evidence.\nPolice said \"shocking\" mobile phone footage that was seized showed \"trophy videos\" where Chaudhury was driving at \"unbelievable speeds\" in a built-up area.\nDuring the sentencing, Judge Jason Macadam said that the men had deliberately absconded and that they \"had done everything they could to avoid the consequences of their actions\".\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Sea swimmers at one of Wales' most popular seaside towns are being warned they may be bathing in contaminated water.\nAn investigation has been launched into a pollution incident in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said.\nA burst rising main - a pressurised pipe which lifts sewage into the public sewer - resulted in sewage entering the river Ritec, which flows to the sea at Tenby South Beach, NRW said.\nIt said there was a potential pollution risk at Tenby South Beach, Castle Beach, Tenby North Beach and nearby Penally Beach.\nVisiting from Stockport, Andrea and Andrew Mcconnell said: \"We've been watching all the children go down [to the water)] but the guards have been stopping them.\"\n\"We just assumed there was a rip tide - it's quite alarming really.\"\nOlivia and Laurence Wall from Nottingham added: \"The worrying thing is [our daughter] wanted to go into the sea, but it was only when the guy said we couldn't that we knew anything about it.\n\"We could've easily missed it.\"\n\"D\u0175r Cymru Welsh Water has informed us of a burst rising main near Tenby which has resulted in sewage entering the River Ritec,\" NRW's Andrea Winterton said. \nShe said the main had been isolated, and that there should be no further pollution into the river from the burst pipe.\n\"Due to the potential for the pollution to impact the downstream bathing waters, we\u2019ve declared an abnormal situation and informed Pembrokeshire County Council who will place signs at the beaches to warn people of the potential pollution risk,\" she added.\nThe council said it would place the signs on the beaches on Tuesday morning.\nA Welsh Water spokesperson said crews were continuing to repair a damaged sewer pipe on land by Clickett Lane, Tenby, which was discovered on Monday.\n\u201cWhile this is taking longer than we anticipated the pipe was quickly isolated so there has been no further pollution,\" they said, adding that it was managing flows in the area and there was no impact on wastewater services in the Tenby area.",

    "Palestinian officials have condemned a dramatic new settlement drive by Israel in the occupied West Bank which includes retroactively authorising three outposts.\nThe move is set to further stoke tensions in the territory which has seen a surge in violence since the war in Gaza began on 7 October.\nPalestinians claim the West Bank as part of their hoped-for future state.  Settlements are widely seen as illegal under international law although Israel disagrees.\nThe three unauthorised outposts that have now been legalised under Israeli law were described as new neighbourhoods of existing settlements.  They are in sensitive areas in the Jordan Valley and near the southern city of Hebron.\nIn addition, the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now said on Thursday that Israeli authorities had approved or advanced plans for 5,295 homes in dozens of settlements.\nIt also emerged this week that the Israeli government\u2019s Higher Planning Council had approved the largest seizure of West Bank land in over three decades.\nSome 12,700 dunams (5 sq miles) has been seized in the Jordan Valley and declared as Israeli state land. This year has marked a peak in the extent of declarations of state land with a total of 23,700 dunams affected.\nThe Palestinian president\u2019s spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdeinah, said the new announcements confirmed that Israel\u2019s \u201cextremist government is bound by the right-wing policy of war and settlement\u201d. \nHe said the latest steps would not \u201cachieve security and peace for anyone\u201d and were meant to prevent the establishment of a geographically contiguous Palestinian state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip.\nLast week, Israel\u2019s security cabinet decided to authorise retroactively five settlement outposts built without official government approval.\nThe UN, the UK and other countries denounced the move as undermining hopes for the two-state solution - the internationally approved formula for peace that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.\n\u201cIsrael must halt its illegal settlement expansion and hold to account those responsible for extremist settler violence,\u201d the British Foreign Office said.\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s priority is to bring the Gaza conflict to a sustainable end as quickly as possible and ensure a lasting peace in the Middle East, through an irreversible pathway towards a two-state solution.\u201d\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the overall strategy for the West Bank.\nHowever, the far-right Israeli minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in a West Bank settlement, has welcomed the recent steps. \"We are building the good land and thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state,\" he said Wednesday on social media platform X.\nNot counting annexed east Jerusalem, about half a million settlers live in the West Bank alongside three million Palestinians. Last year, Mr Smotrich instructed government departments to prepare to double the number of settlers to one million.\nSince Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War, successive Israeli administrations have allowed settlements to grow.  However, expansion has risen sharply since Mr Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the head of a hardline, pro-settler governing coalition.\nLast month, Peace Now released the recording of an address by Mr Smotrich to his Religious Zionism party, in which he proposes transferring the management of settlements from military to civilian officials, building a separate road bypass system for settlers,  expanding farming outposts and cracking down on unauthorised Palestinian construction.\nPeace Now warned that the plan would irreversibly change the way the West Bank was governed and lead to \u201cde facto annexation\u201d.",
    "The long wait for driving tests in parts of England has reached \"crisis point\", an instructor said.\nSue Papworth, from Cambridgeshire, said some pupils were travelling hundreds of miles to other areas in order to get a test.\nHer pupil Sara Canamares, 17, said a six-month wait for her examination was playing on her mind and was proving extremely costly.\nThe AA has called on the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) to recruit more examiners and make more tests available. The DVSA said it was \"working hard\" to rectify the problems.\nCamilla Benitz, managing director of the AA Driving School, said: \"If you're looking for a driving test right now, it is incredibly challenging.\n\"We have seen a 20% increase in the wait time since the start of this year.\n\"Nationally it's about 19 weeks. If you're in the East of England it can be even longer.\n\"We're looking at a maximum of 24 weeks in Ipswich, Colchester, Cambridge, Northampton, Stevenage - it's really widespread.\"\nShe said during the pandemic \"about a million tests\" were cancelled and despite it being a number of years since, \"the DVSA has failed to tackle that backlog\". \nInstructor Ms Papworth, who has been teaching learner drivers for 18 years, said: \"Having checked [on Thursday morning] there's no test availability for Cambridge - but that's country-wide. We've reached crisis point, really.\n\"It's very difficult for anyone to book a practical driving test - more than one million people are looking for a test,\" she said.\nMs Papworth said in the city the wait for a theory test could be up to a month, but for a practical test the wait could be five or six months.\n\"People spend an absolute fortune going out of area to try and secure a test,\" said Ms Papworth.\n\"When I started as a driving instructor, we didn't even think about booking a test until a student had passed their theory and was driving really quite well.\"\nThe current wait was \"the worst I've ever known it and I can't see it getting any better\".\nOne of those trying to cope with the wait is student Sara, who has already passed her theory test and has had about 10 weeks of two-hour lessons.\nThe 17-year-old booked her test three weeks ago, but the earliest available date was in November.\n\"It means I'm going to have to continue my lessons for a lot longer than I thought, and it's a lot of money to have a lesson every week for that long,\" she said.\nPassing her test could mean she would no longer have to rely on her parents driving her the 20-minute journey to school.\n\"A lot of my friends are learning to drive so it's a common topic of conversation,\" she said.\nThe AA's Ms Benitz said: \"The only way to solve this problem is to make more driving tests available, so the DVSA has to recruit and retain examiners.\n\"We're really calling on the new government to make this a priority.\"\nThe DVSA said it was doing all it could to increase the number of tests available, while also combating issues including the use of automated computer systems, or bots, and people reselling booked timeslots.\nIts chief executive, Loveday Ryder, said: \"In the past financial year alone we've provided almost two million tests, the highest ever, and we continue to work hard to increase the number available by recruiting more examiners while tackling bots and those who are exploiting learners.\n\"We want to see more learners passing first time, so we're working with the driver training industry to educate and advise learners on what they can do to prepare and improve their likelihood of passing.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has launched more than 200 rockets and attack drones into northern Israel, in response to the killing of one of its senior commanders.\nIsrael's military said one of its officers was killed in the barrage, which started a number of fires. \nThe military also said it had targeted Hezbollah \u201cmilitary structures\u201d and other targets in southern Lebanon in response. \nLebanese media reported that one person was killed in an Israeli drone strike in the town of Houla.\nThe latest barrage, which followed one comprising 100 rockets on Wednesday afternoon, was one of the biggest so far in the nine months of cross-border violence which have raised fears of an all-out war.\nThe Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli air strike near the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, Mohammed Nimah Nasser, was one of the most senior figures in the group to have been killed in the conflict.\nThe Israeli military said Nasser commanded Hezbollah\u2019s Aziz Unit, which is responsible for launching rockets from south-western Lebanon, and accused him of directing a \u201clarge number of terror attacks\u201d.\nIt also described him as \u201cthe counterpart\u201d of Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of another unit whose killing last month prompted Hezbollah to launch more than 200 rockets and missiles into northern Israel in a single day.\nThere have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October.\nHezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian group that is also backed by Iran. Both groups are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries.\nSo far, more than 400 people have been reported killed in Lebanon, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, and 25 people in Israel, mostly soldiers.\nThe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to restore security in northern Israel.\n\"In the tough campaign against Lebanon we have set a principle - whoever harms us is a dead man.

    "Since 2022 a solar-powered boat has taken people on trips along the River Derwent in Derby, raising awareness about plans to restore the Derby Canal.\nBut there has been a problem - the boat could not be fully charged by the sun because it was moored under a bridge.\nNow a pontoon is set to be installed on the river, meaning the boat will be able to run completely off sunlight.\nThe Derby and Sandiacre Canal Trust, which operates the boat, said the pontoon will make the trips more environmentally friendly, and enable wheelchair users to get aboard.\nTrust chairman Chris Madge said: \"We're in Derby and as everybody knows, we're the centre of engineering excellence in the country, so a lot of our members are engineers by nature.\n\"It was really important to all of us that we made it environmentally friendly.\"\nThe boat was designed with the help of trust vice-chairman Mike Wingfield, who also works at Rolls-Royce in Derby, where he looks for new technologies that will help the company.\nThe boat's propulsion is powered by electricity, similar to an electric car.\nBut unlike an electric car, the boat's batteries can be charged in two ways - either by plugging it in to an electricity supply, or by solar panels on the roof.\nThere is a charging point at the boat's current mooring under the bridge.\nThe mooring at Phoenix Green was chosen as the best place to keep the boat when the boat was launched in 2022, but because the boat is in the shade it cannot be charged by sunlight.\nThe new pontoon - essentially a large floating platform - will be located near the bridge but in a more visible spot that is not shaded.\n\"We want it [the pontoon] to be the start of having boats visible in the city centre and building towards a waterfront in Derby,\" said Mr Wingfield.\n\"There's always been a criticism that Derby has turned its back on the river and we feel this is the way to address that.\"\nIt is hoped the River Derwent will eventually link up with the Derby Canal once it has been restored.\nThe Derby Canal was completed in 1796 and ran 14 miles (23 km) from the Trent and Mersey Canal at Swarkestone to the Erewash Canal at Sandiacre.\nIt was mainly used for transporting coal, but its use declined following the arrival of the railways.\nCommercial traffic ceased in the 1940s and the canal closed completely in 1964.\n\"Over time it was filled in to make it safe and converted into paths,\" said Mr Madge.\nThe Derby and Sandiacre Canal Trust wants to \"undo\" the closure and restore the canal as closely as possible to its original route.\n\"It just produces such benefits to everybody, to the community,\" said Mr Madge.\n\"It provides activities for everybody, so paddle-boarding as well as normal boats, and fishing.\n\"It's great in terms of regeneration, in terms of the businesses that go along the canal, and everybody just seems to relax when they're on water.\"\nThe canal will not be able to follow its original route through Derby city centre as it has been built on in places, so instead it will follow a new route that crosses over part of the River Derwent.\nBoats will also be able to cruise along part of the River Derwent.\nThe trust is proposing to build a huge electro-mechanical structure close to Pride Park that would lift boats out of the restored canal and place them down into the river.\nIt would be known as the Derby Arm Boat Lift, and would be one of only three big canal boat lifts in the UK.\nThe existing ones are the Anderton Boat Lift in Cheshire, which is one of the Seven Wonders of the Waterways, and the Falkirk Wheel in Scotland, which attracts more than 650,000 paying visitors a year.\n\u201cThe Derby Arm would become not only a regional landmark but also an international tourist attraction,\" said Mr Madge, who added that it would be \"a statement of the city\u2019s pioneering heritage in innovative engineering\".\nThe trust has had planning permission for the pontoon for more than a year but is waiting for final approval from Derby City Council.\n\"We're waiting for all the elements to come together, the council permissions, and the final sanction of the design,\" said Mr Madge.\n\"We just need to build it now.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The loss of a piece of equipment by a Royal Marine recruit led him to take his own life on a railway line, an inquest concluded.\nSenior coroner Philip Spinney criticised failures in Connor Clark's mental health care, after the 18-year-old from Norwich was found dead on the tracks next to the Commando Training Centre in Devon on 12 June 2021.\nThe teenager had commented prior to his death about being called a \"failure\" and the \"worst recruit\", for misplacing the blank firing adapter for his weapon.\nMr Spinney said Mr Clark had died from multiple severe injuries as he recorded a conclusion of suicide.\nThe coroner for Devon, Plymouth & Torbay said there was evidence Mr Clark had been looking for the piece of equipment ahead of an inspection due on the day he died.\nHe said: \"I conclude that Connor losing his blank firing attachment probably contributed more than minimally to the cause of his death.\"\nThe teenager was three weeks into a four-week recruit orientation phase course at Lympstone that Marines take before their initial training.\nThe inquest has heard he had \"struggled\" with organising his personal kit and had failed inspections.\nThe inquest in Exeter heard fellow recruits describe a \"hostile atmosphere\" between them and instructors who would shout and swear and hand out group thrashings for collective mistakes.\nFellow recruits said he had suffered more \"thrashings\" - a type of physical punishment like running or press ups - than anyone else.\nThe officer in charge, Major Mark Thrift, denied he had called Mr Clark the \"worst recruit\", but accepted he told him he was failing the course.\nAble Seaman Chris Lee, who was on the same course, rejected claims the teenager had been a target of bullying by instructors.\n\"I wouldn't say he was singled out or targeted any more than the rest of the troop,\" he said.\nTwo days before Mr Clark died, he had gone to the sick bay for treatment for a wound to his elbow.\nThe inquest heard he had self-harmed by using a knife to reopen the wound.\nAn internal review concluded Mr Clark should have received a mental health assessment.\n\"It is clear that I did not adhere to the guidance and thus made a poor and a wrong decision in not seeking a case conference,\" said Surgeon Commander Jon Bedford, an experienced locum.\nIn his conclusion, Mr Spinney said: \"Connor was finding some aspects of the course difficult. \n\"Connor's own perception of his performance on the course probably, or more than minimally, contributed to his death.\n\"Connor losing his blank firing attachment probably contributed more than minimally to his death.\n\"The response by the Commando Training Centre to the information that Connor had gone missing from the camp was inadequate. It cannot be said this made any contribution to Connor's death.\"",
    "Government plans to end an effective ban on onshore wind turbines have been described as an \"attack on the countryside\" by a senior Lincolnshire county councillor.\nIn a speech on Monday, Labour's new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the government would end what she called an \"absurd ban\" on new onshore wind turbines.\nHowever, Lincolnshire County Council's executive member for economy, environment and strategic planning Colin Davie said he was concerned about the potential impact on the county's agricultural industry.\nIn 2021, the county council passed a motion saying it would \"object to all\" wind turbines except those on a small scale.\nThe topic of wind farms has been a controversial one in Lincolnshire, with the county boasting huge, flat expanses of agricultural land.\nIn Ms Reeves' first speech as chancellor, she said the new government would be taking \"tough\" and \"hard choices\" to grow the economy.\nIn 2015, the Conservative goverment changed planning rules, which gave local people more say on large projects like windfarms.\nOn Monday, the chancellor said: \"Any development may have environmental consequences, place pressure on services and rouse voices of local opposition, but we will not succumb to a status quo which responds to the existence of trade-offs by always saying no.\"\nMr Davie said: \"This is an attack on the countryside.\n\"There is no indication that they actually understand what their announcements would mean for farmland and food security.\n\"That is actually a priority equal to anything else in my view and there\u2019s been no attempt to address any of that.\"\nThe government said it is committed to a \"clean power mission\" which it claimed would \"save people money on energy bills, support high-skilled jobs and tackle the climate crisis\".\nIt has scrapped a rule which it said meant \"any opposition\" to a proposal \"cannot be considered acceptable\".\nMs Reeves said it should lead to hundreds of turbines being built, but admitted there would be opposition to the plans.\n\"I'm not naive to that, and we must acknowledge that trade-offs always exist,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

    "No care and treatment plan was in place for a woman with paranoid schizophrenia who went on to kill an elderly man weeks after leaving hospital, an inquest has heard.\nJohn Rees, 88, died after being set upon by Zara Radcliffe at the Co-op in Penygraig, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in May 2020.\nRadcliffe was released from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 24 February of that year after receiving inpatient care for about four months, during which time the court heard her mental health improved.\nLaura Morse, a care coordinator who oversaw Radcliffe\u2019s treatment after her release, said she only met her once on 2 March because face-to-face visits were stopped shortly after due to the rise of Covid-19.\nIn a statement to police which was read to the court, Ms Morse described Radcliffe as being \"normal\" and \"quiet\" during this meeting.\n\"She told me she was hearing voices but these were reassuring. We talked about her moving out of her parents\u2019 house and going back to college.\"\nThe court heard about two other phone calls Ms Morse had with either Radcliffe or her mother where \"no concerns\" were raised.\nNo care and treatment plan was drawn up for Radcliffe which, according to guidance, should have been done within six weeks.\nAsked why no plan was in place, Ms Morse told the court it been a \"very chaotic\" time and her role and guidance changed \"on a daily basis\", but could not give \"a definite answer\".\nThe inquest had earlier heard about a blood sample taken from by Radcliffe on 5 May, the day of the attack, showed traces of cannabis and diazepam.\nAnalysis of a hair sample taken a day later showed traces of diazepam, cannabis,  cocaine, heroin and amphetamines.\nThe court was told this would be consistent with use between late January and late April, but could not be used to establish use in the days directly before the killing.\nThe court had heard Racliffe had become an \"informal patient\" and was able to leave the unit at the hospital for specific periods.\nOn 13 February, after one such occasion, she took a voluntary drugs test which showed signs of cocaine use.\nDr Kishore Kale, a psychiatrist who was the responsible clinician for Radcliffe from 7 February until her discharge two-and-a-half weeks later, said this was not considered a \"setback\" in her treatment.\nHe said the evidence suggested she was \"mentally improving\" and that he was satisfied she could be discharged.\nThe court heard the discharge plan set the next psychiatric appointment for four months\u2019 time.\nCoroner Graeme Hughes said that appeared to be \"a long time\" for someone with paranoid schizophrenia and an \"extensive\" medical history.\n\u201cI am absolutely with you.

    "Eighteen constituencies, hundreds of thousands of votes and 10 hours of counting - welcome to the 2024 general election in Northern Ireland.\nIt's been a long, bleary night for the candidates, vote counters and commentators watching on but we now know who is being sent to Westminster.\nFrom Sinn F\u00e9in celebrations to DUP commiserations, the storylines that have emerged since the polls closed will reverberate through Northern Ireland politics for some time to come.\nHere's a rundown of everything you need to know from a night of drama. \nThe DUP losing three seats is bad \u2013 but the nature of those losses will really sting.\nFirst, in Lagan Valley, the constituency of former leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Jonathan Buckley was defeated by Alliance\u2019s Sorcha Eastwood.\nThe constituency, formed in 1983, has only ever returned unionist MPs \u2013 until now.\nMr Buckley highlighted boundary changes and unionist splits for the defeat, although others may also wonder about the impact of Sir Jeffrey stepping down from the DUP as he contests charges over alleged historical sex offences.\nThen another shocker \u2013 Ian Paisley toppled in North Antrim by Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister.\nIt will be the first time in 54 years the constituency will not be represented by an Ian Paisley \u2013 the younger had succeeded his father, the DUP co-founder and former first minister who dominated Northern Ireland politics for decades.\nIn East Londonderry and East Antrim, Gregory Campbell and Sammy Wilson held onto their seats, but with a much reduced share of votes.\nElsewhere, leader Gavin Robinson did see off the challenge of Alliance leader Naomi Long. But, just a few months into his leadership, he\u2019ll be left to contemplate what comes next.\nThe largest Northern Ireland party at local council level, at Stormont and, now, at Westminster - not a bad night's work for Sinn F\u00e9in.\nAfter a bruising time in the Irish council and European elections, this will be a welcome pick-me-up for leader Mary-Lou McDonald and Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O\u2019Neill.\nThe party may not take their seats at the House of Commons, due to their long-held policy of abstentionism, but it will nonetheless see the results as a welcome step forward.\nThere may be some disappointment it did not get closer in Foyle, although it did eat into SDLP leader Colum Eastwood\u2019s majority, but all in all it was a relatively smooth night for the party.\nFrom 2019 to today, the number of Alliance MPs remains the same \u2013 one.\nBut the manner of returning that single MP couldn\u2019t have been more of a rollercoaster.\nFirst, early indications showed that sitting MP, and party deputy leader, Stephen Farry faced an uphill battle to retain his seat from independent unionist Alex Easton.\nIndependent unionist Alex Easton, who previously represented the DUP in the constituency as an assembly member, was aiming to take it back - his success was a disappointing blow for Mr Farry.\nBut that Alliance disappointment soon turned to joy, when it emerged that Sorcha Eastwood had won Lagan Valley, seeing off the challenge of the DUP\u2019s Jonathan Buckley.\nThat was a historic victory - given a non-unionist had triumphed in the constituency for the first time - but Alliance may feel disappointed they were unable to increase their Westminster representation. \nThere were high hopes leader Naomi Long would take back her seat in Belfast East but she was unable to topple DUP leader Gavin Robinson. \n\nThe party went in with two \u2013 Colum Eastwood and Claire Hanna \u2013 and came out with both still in their Westminster seats.\nMs Hanna eased to victory in Belfast South and Mid Down. \nAnd while Colum Eastwood saw his majority in Foyle significantly cut back, he\u2019ll be happy to have seen himself get back over the line. \nElsewhere, a hoped-for challenge to Sinn F\u00e9in's Chris Hazzard in South Down did not really materialise and the SDLP may feel it has been leapfrogged by Sinn F\u00e9in in East Londonderry.\nBut the party will likely be content it has avoided the significant losses incurred in previous elections. \n\nThe Ulster Unionists used to dominate Northern Ireland politics, not least in Westminster representation. But they haven\u2019t had an MP since 2017 \u2013 until now.\nStep forward former health minister Robin Swann, who defeated the DUP\u2019s Paul Girvan in South Antrim.\nMr Swann\u2019s decision to step down as a minister to run for Westminster attracted some flak \u2013 particularly since Stormont had only been restored a short amount of time \u2013 but he and UUP leader Doug Beattie can feel the move has paid off.\nThat\u2019s doubly true since the party failed to make breakthroughs anywhere else. It was hopeful of deputy leader Robbie Butler\u2019s chances in Lagan Valley but he did not seriously trouble Sorcha Eastwood.\nMeanwhile the selection of Iraq War veteran Col Tim Collins did not work in North Down. \nHe conceded the seat earlier this morning saying that North Down residents \u201cdon\u2019t want someone who doesn\u2019t live in Northern Ireland\u201d and that voters th",

The usual option would be a two-hour flight from the UK, but the cost rose dramatically following England\u2019s win in the semi-final.\nA KLM flight from Manchester to Berlin Brandenburg via Amsterdam on 13 July was listed at \u00a3954 on Thursday - compared to \u00a3223 a week later.\nSome options remained relatively affordable, such as a Scandinavian Airlines flight from Heathrow to Berlin via Copenhagen, listed at \u00a3268.\nEngland fan Stephen said flights to Germany were too expensive, so instead he  was considering flying to Poland. \n\"We looked at neighbouring countries and the cheapest was a flight to Poznan in Poland, so we have six-hour flight with a stopover in Warsaw,\" he said.\n\"Once we get to Poznan we will get a train straight to Berlin.\"\nAirlines Ryanair and Eurowings both said they had added two flights to Berlin in time for the final.\nBritish Airways said: \u201cWe\u2019re currently looking at putting on additional flights and changing the aircraft type to bigger jets to accommodate as many fans as possible over the coming days.\u201d\nBut EasyJet told the BBC it had \u201cno plans\u201d to put on extra flights to Berlin in time for the final.\nScott Hatley, from Southend-on-Sea, said he \u201ctook a punt\" on booking flights for the final before the tournament began, in the hope England made it.\nThe tickets, which cost him \u00a384, \u201clook like a bargain compared to prices now,\u201d he added.\nBut if money is no object, chartering a private jet for four people from Farnborough airport in Hampshire costs about \u00a311,220 if booked through PrivateFly. As you do. \nAnother option is to take the train.\nFans have several options, according to Mark Smith of The Man in Seat 61. These include a Eurostar from London to Brussels, followed by a German ICE train to Cologne and another ICE to Berlin.\nBut Mr Smith said the best option was likely to be the ferry from Harwich to Hoek van Holland near The Hague in the Netherlands, followed by a train from The Hague to Berlin. The ferry comes in at about \u00a383 for a single passenger with no car and the train at about \u00a3112.\n\u201cAt short notice, Harwich-Hoek is actually quite good,\u201d he told the BBC, adding that sleeper trains from the Netherlands to Berlin were also likely to have some last-minute availability.\nFor fans willing to brave a drive of 13-15 hours from the UK to Germany, the car may be a reliable option.\nFerries depart from Harwich, Newcastle and Hull to destinations in the Netherlands, where fans can continue on to Berlin. On Thursday, ferry crossings for two people in a Ford Fiesta this weekend were listed at between \u00a3200 and \u00a3500.\nDrivers from southern England can take either the ferry or Channel Tunnel shuttle from Dover to Calais, in northern France. From there it is around 10 hours\u2019 drive to Berlin. Prices for the shuttle, which carries cars, were listed at around \u00a3130 on Thursday.\nIf you\u2019re really committed and don\u2019t mind sitting on a coach for 26 hours, you could get a Flixbus from Stratford, east London to Berlin Central Station for \u00a3150 one-way. Capacity is showing as almost full, and the bus operator expects to sell every seat ahead of the game.\nThe service also operates from Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester and Bristol. Coaches are running throughout the weekend to locations including Alexanderplatz, which is half an hour from the stadium. Prices vary from \u00a3150 to \u00a3250.\nFans on a quest to watch the game in Berlin will also need a place to stay. Hotel prices in the German capital this weekend ",
    "World leaders including King Charles and US President Joe Biden joined D-Day veterans to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings on 6 June. \nThe King, Queen and Prince of Wales joined veterans in Portsmouth on Wednesday to mark the anniversary.\nTroops from the UK, the US, Canada, and France attacked German forces on the coast of northern France, on 6 June 1944.\nD-Day was the largest military seaborne operation ever attempted, and marked the start of the campaign to liberate Nazi-occupied north-west Europe. \nIt involved the simultaneous landing of tens of thousands of troops on five separate beaches in Normandy.\nMore than a year in the planning, D-Day was originally set to start on 5 June, judged to be the most likely date to combine calm seas, a full moon and low water at first light. However, storms meant it was delayed by 24 hours to 6 June.\nThe \"D\" simply stands for \"day\". D-Day is a military term for the first day of an operation\nAirborne troops were dropped behind enemy lines in the early hours, while thousands of ships gathered off the Normandy coast for the main seaborne attack.\nThough they were expecting an invasion, German military leaders believed the initial attacks were only a diversionary tactic. \nA deception plan in the weeks ahead of the attack had led them to expect the main invasion further along the coast.\nThe surprise element helped British troops establish a foothold on a beach codenamed Gold.\nIn addition, Canadian forces established themselves on another beach - Juno - and the British got on to Sword beach.\nAmerican soldiers also managed to land on the westernmost beach - Utah - without major casualties.\nBut at nearby Omaha beach, the US force suffered serious losses. The naval barrage and bombing raids on the German defences were ineffective and the Americans encountered a crack division of German troops.\nShortly after midnight, three US and British airborne divisions, more than 23,000 men, took off to secure the flanks of the beaches. Myriad naval vessels and landing craft gathered at a location in the Channel dubbed \"Piccadilly Circus\".\nFrom 06:30, the first five assault divisions were delivered to their beaches under cover of a naval bombardment. \nThroughout the day troops landed on the beaches. By midnight, the Allies had secured their beachheads and pushed further inland from Gold, Juno, Sword and Utah. \nUp to 7,000 ships and landing craft were involved, delivering a total of 156,000 men and 10,000 vehicles to the five beaches along the carefully selected stretch of the Normandy coast. \nThe landings would not have been possible without the support of massive air and naval forces, which were much stronger than those of the Germans.\nBut on D-Day alone, as many as 4,400 troops died from the combined allied forces. Some 9,000 were wounded or missing. \nTotal German casualties on the day are not known, but are estimated as being between 4,000 and 9,000 men. \nThousands of French civilians also perished, mainly as a result of bombing raids carried out by allied forces.\nAlthough they had got a foothold in France by the end of D-Day, allied forces were for a while at risk of being pushed back into the sea. \nThey had to keep building up their forces faster than the Germans could reinforce theirs.\nProgress through the narrow lanes and staunchly defended towns of Normandy was slow.\nBut now outnumbering their enemy and supported by their air superiority, they were able to overcome the considerable resistance - though at a heavy price.\nBy the time they liberated Paris, in late August 1944, about 10% of the two million allied troops who had by then reached France were dead, wounded or missing.\nIt is not clear how many D-Day veterans are still alive. All are now in their 90s or 100s.\nIt is thought there are just over 100 surviving British veterans. \nThe BBC's Royal Correspondent Sean Coughlan says 23 were taking part in the commemorations in Normandy, and a further 21 attended a memorial event at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.\nTwo dozen US veterans were also expected to make the trip to France, according to the American Battle Monuments Commission, which oversees US cemeteries and monuments abroad.\nHave you recently discovered your loved one was a D-Day veteran?

    "The death of a 20-year-old inmate in his cell at Polmont Young Offenders Institution could not have been prevented, a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) has heard.\nJack McKenzie took his own life on 3 September 2021, just hours after he was passed the drug etizolam.\nHe had been on remand at Polmont for rape and sexual assault charges - which he denied - since January of that year.\nThe FAI follows the joint inquiry into the deaths of Katie Allan, 21, and 16-year-old William Brown.\nKatie and William - who was known as William Lindsay - took their lives in the institution in 2018.\nThe purpose of an FAI is to establish whether these deaths could have been prevented.\nIt will also examine what precautions could be taken in future to try and stop young people from taking their own lives in prison.\nSheriff Simon Collins, who has heard both inquiries, will receive further submissions on Mr McKenzie\u2019s case.\nHe is expected to make recommendations for change when he delivers his determination into the circumstances of all three deaths later in the year.\nThe FAI previously heard Mr McKenzie was described by prison officers as happy and had a good rapport with the staff.\nHis family said he had misused substances in Polmont and had been put on a programme to manage substance misuse 14 times in seven months while he was in custody.\nOn 1 September 2021 Mr McKenzie had been due to attend court and thought there was a chance he was going to be released.\nBut during the day he became agitated and was assessed as being under the influence of an illegal substance.\nHe was placed on observations in Monro Hall and was also put into isolation where he was only released from his cell for around 20 minutes in a 24-hour period.\nMr McKenzie was meant to see his solicitor that afternoon but could not as he was on observations.\nHe was later removed from drug observations but remained in isolation.\nThe inquiry heard Mr McKenzie had been passed a line of etizolam into his cell in the early hours of 3 September and had been shouting from the windows.\nThe FAI heard a prison officer should have checked he was in his cell at 06:30.\nBut the officer looked through the hatch and assumed he was elsewhere.\nAt the next check, at about 07:30, the 20-year-old was found dead.\nOn Friday, Falkirk Sheriff Court heard the final oral evidence in the inquiry.\nDr Duncan Alcock, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the State Hospital at Carstairs, reviewed Mr McKenzie\u2019s case.\nIn relation to how he was treated by staff and how they engaged with him for dealing with substance misuse, he said: \"I don\u2019t think anything further could have been done.\"\nAnother consultant psychiatrist, Dr Laurence Tuddenham told the FAI that, in his opinion, Mr McKenzie's suicide was \"not preventable\". \nThe expert added: \"He had no history of thoughts of self-harm, acts of self-harm or suicide attempts either in prison or the community, prior to his suicide.\n\"I think he received adequate care seen by mental health and addiction staff.\"\nHowever, the inquiry previously heard there were dangers in taking what a prisoner said at face value in risk assessments. \nAnd, in relation to the drugs misuse policy, Sue McAllister, former director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, said: \"Shortcomings were frequently found in reports and there was an over reliance on self-reporting.\"\nThe inquiry heard in 2018 a risk assessment report had highlighted that the bathroom doors in Monro hall could be used as a ligature point.\nThree years on nothing has been done in relation to reduce that risk.\nThe court was also told night shift officer David Nelson breached patrol duty orders by not carrying out a proper hatch check.\nHe accepted if he had done his check properly he could have potentially saved Mr McKenzie's life.\nThe FAI previously heard from his aunt Caroline Wright, who he mainly lived with until just before he was remanded.\nIn a statement read in court she said: \"I was very close to Jack. \n\"I think about him every day. \n\"I still cannot believe he is no longer with us.\" \nShe also said her nephew, who had previously been involved with gangs in the east end of Glasgow, told her he did not commit the offences for which he was remanded. \nMr McKenzie's brother Steven said in his affidavit that the two grew up together until the death of their grandmother, who they lived with, in May 2012.\nAt the time Steven was about 17 and his brother was about 12. \nThey remained close for another five years.\nSteven said: \"Jack did get into bother with the police due to the way he had been brought up and he did go about with a bad crowd.\"\nHe also told the court that his brother, who he described as \"very kind\", was \"always very clear he was innocent\".\nSteven added: \"I miss Jack every day and I cannot believe he is no longer here.\"",
    "US start-up Aerolane is seeking the secret to airborne surfing.\nGeese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them.\nAt an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo.\nAerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft.\nSmoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft.\nTheir latest test aircraft is known as the \u201cflying piano\u201d because of its poor gliding characteristics. \nIts twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes.\nOther tests have measured the tension in the towing line.\nThey spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead.\nAerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel.\nOne or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously.\nThe only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft\u2019s engines.\nIn theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls \u201ca combination of gliding and surfing\u201d.\nThe same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic.\nAlthough the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350\u2019s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn.\nMr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years\u2019 experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi and Doron Appelboim, veterans of Amazon\u2019s drone delivery project, on the basis that \u201cthere has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft\". \nThe project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations.\nFor instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population.\nAerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by.\nMr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve engaged outside advisors to be devil\u2019s advocates,\" he adds.\nHe says big freight businesses are interested in anything that allows them to cut the cost per delivery. \nOn top of the cost of fuel, air freight firms also have to think about jet engine emissions and a shortage of pilots.\nJames Earl, a former RAF helicopter pilot and aviation consultant, thinks Mr Graetz may just be onto something.\n\u201cIt stands to reason that gains can be had by slipstreaming and combining efforts in the sky. And any innovation in the cargo space is good.\u201d\nHowever, he cautions that public acceptance of unpowered cargo flights over built-up areas is another thing entirely.\n\u201cIt should have a good gliding range to get to a landing spot in the event of a major failure by the tow plane. Whether that can be effectively communicated to the public is another matter though.\u201d\nRegulators are likely to be cautious as well, particularly in the US, where the Federal Aviation Authority is under pressure after serious problems with Boeing aircraft.\nMr Graetz replies that his team has complied with every request from the FAA so far. \u201cThe FAA has always been super risk averse. That\u2019s their business!\u201d\nFred Lopez spent 36 years in aviation operations at cargo giant UPS. As he says, he\u2019s put  \u201cmy entire adult life\u201d into working out the most cost-effective way to operate an air freight business.\nMr Lopez admits he was profoundly sceptical about cargo gliders when Aerolane first approached him. But the prospect of serious fuel savings won him over and now he sits on their advisory board.\nCutting fuel costs is an obsession in civil aviation. When the upturned wing-tips we see out of a cabin window became a standard design feature airlines cut fuel costs by around 5%.\nBut gliders only consume the fuel required by their tow plane. If that too is a cargo aircraft, a pair of gliders drawn by one jet represents a significant reduction in fuel consumption on a large shipment.\nThe initial Aerolane design uses their autopilot plus what Mr Lopez terms a human \u201csafety pilot\u201d. This should make certification from",
    "Iran\u2019s president-elect Masoud Pezeshkian stood as a wildcard candidate, and defied expectations to win the presidency against hardline rival Saeed Jalili.\nMr Pezeshkian is notable because he is \"a reformist\". But not the liberal-minded, democracy-loving kind of reformist, in the universal sense.\nIn Iran, \"the reformists\" are one ideological faction of the Islamic Republic's ruling elite. \nThey are Islamists, like their conservative rivals, but believe a more moderate version of the regime\u2019s ideology could better serve both the ruling clergy and Iranian society.\nReformists led the administration from 1997 until 2005 and were part of a de facto coalition when Hassan Rouhani, a conservative who became a centrist, was president between 2013 and 2021.\nThey have often called for a freer and more democratic society.\nBut in the 2024 election, unlike the previous reformist administration in the late 1990s, promises for a freer and more democratic society were not part of their campaign.\nSince the 1990s, Iran has experienced multiple waves of dissent and oppression. Even reformists themselves have faced severe political crackdowns, with many high-profile figures spending time in jail over the last two decades.\nThough members of the establishment, It is widely acknowledged that they lack influence over crucial centres of power, such as the Supreme Leader\u2019s Office, the Guardian Council, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), and the Supreme National Security Council.\nWhen hardline former president Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash in May and Mr Pezeshkian prepared his presidential campaign, he chose a strategy very similar to Hassan Rouhani\u2019s in 2013: focusing on the economic hardship the country has been facing for years due to Western sanctions - and blaming their conservative rivals for causing this situation with their \u201cradical\u201d anti-West stances. \nAs part of his campaign, Mr Pezeshkian recruited Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country\u2019s former foreign minister who helped strike the nuclear deal in 2015. Although Mr Zarif is not a reformist per se, he campaigned heavily for Mr Pezeshkian.\nIn his manifesto, Mr Pezeshkian declared that his foreign policy would be \u201cnot anti-West, nor anti-East.\u201d He criticised former president Raisi\u2019s policies of moving the country closer to Russia and China and insisted that the only way to resolve the economic crisis is through negotiations with the West to end the nuclear standoff and ease the sanctions. \nHowever, during the campaign, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticised these ideas. Mr Khamenei called those who believe in achieving prosperity through friendlier relations with the US \u201cdeluded,\u201d - pointing to the fact that it was the US, not Iran, that withdrew from the nuclear deal.\nAccording to the Iranian constitution, Mr Khamenei is the main decision-maker; an 85-year-old Shia cleric who was a revolutionary in 1979 and climbed the power ladder to become the head of state in 1989. He is known for his ideological animosity towards Israel and the United States, his deep distrust of the West, and in the last two decades, his active support for a doctrine called \u201clook to the East,\u201d which means ending the old non-aligned policy and leaning towards China and Russia on the global stage.\nOne of the most important aspects of Iran\u2019s policies in the region is what the Quds Force (the external arm of the IRGC) does. The president does not have any direct control over them, and only the Supreme Leader can decide their actions.\nMr Khamenei repeatedly \u2013 including just three days before the first round of this election \u2013 stated that what the Quds Force does is essential for the country\u2019s security doctrine.\nSo when Mr Pezeshkian talks about a different foreign policy with a friendlier approach to the West, the chance of changes in Iran\u2019s activities in countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen are slim.\nNevertheless, the president is the highest-ranking Iranian diplomat, and the foreign ministry can still help shape and implement policy.\nThey have the opportunity to push for their vision through behind-the-door political lobbying, as happened in 2015 when then-centrist President Hassan Rouhani convinced the hardliners, including Mr Khamenei himself, to accept the deal.\nMoreover, the administration could significantly impact public discourse and promote policies that might not fully align with Mr Khamenei\u2019s stance. Such nuances are the reformists' only hope to do what they promised and bring down what Mr Pezeshkian called the \u201cwalls that have been built around the country by the hardliners.\u201d",
    "Unilever plans to cut a third of its office-based roles in Europe by the end of 2025, the consumer goods giant has said.\nIt comes after it announced in March that it would be cutting costs, affecting about 7,500 roles globally.\nThe firm said it would begin a consultation process with those affected by cuts in Europe, with about 3,200 jobs being axed in the region.\n\"We recognise the significant anxiety that these proposals are causing among our people,\" it said in a statement.\nThe changes are part of efforts to revive growth at the firm under boss Hein Schumacher who took over as chief executive last year after underperformance in recent years.\nIt was not immediately clear where the job cuts would fall. \nUnilever has major offices in London and Rotterdam, where the company maintained dual headquarters for decades before deciding in 2020 to unify its legal structure in the UK.

    "Tesla sales, hit by a significant slump earlier this year, may be showing signs of revival.\nElon Musk's electric car-maker delivered nearly 444,000 vehicles in the three months ended 30 June, up more than 14% from the prior quarter. \nThat was far more than most analysts had expected - though still down nearly 5% from the same period in 2023.\nTesla has been navigating a slowdown in demand, as high borrowing costs weigh on buyers and competition increases. \nIt has slashed prices repeatedly to try to win back shoppers, while also introducing low-cost borrowing plans.\nBut its success in this has been limited.\nThe firm, which announced plans in April to sack more than 10% of its workforce, has seen sales fall in the first half of the year. \nAt the start of the year, Tesla blamed its poor performance in part on supply shortages due to shipping disruption in the Red Sea and an alleged arson attack at its factory in Germany. \nBut analysts say Tesla needs to freshen its line-up, if it hopes to stop rivals from making inroads. \nThe company started selling its cyber-truck last year but that remains a tiny part of its business. Its mainstream Model 3 sedan was first released in 2017.\nMr Musk, who recently won shareholder support for a record-breaking pay package worth roughly $50bn, has outlined a bright future for the firm, underpinned by self driving and automation. \nAnd despite industry concerns that demand for electric vehicles in the US in recent months has been weaker than anticipated, the sector is still growing globally. \nMore than one in five cars sold this year around the world are expected to be electric - including nearly half in China and roughly a quarter in Europe, according to a recent outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA). \nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said he thought the worst was behind Tesla, noting signs of improvement in China, where the government recently announced it would give money to people who trade in older cars in a wider boost for the industry.\n\"While its been a difficult period for Tesla and the company has been through some significant cost reductions (roughly 10%-15%) to preserve its bottom line/profitability, it appears better days are now ahead,\" he wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday.\nHe said he expected the firm's upcoming August presentation on robotaxis to drive a new wave of growth. \nShares in the firm jumped more than 6% in morning trade on Tuesday following the news.",
    "A town's new MP says she is determined to get its hospital rebuilt after \"five years of mismanagement\" of the project.\nLabour's Rosie Wrighting made her first constituency visit as MP to Kettering General Hospital, where most of the site is due to be rebuilt over the next few years.\nMs Wrighting said both she and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, were \"committed\" to getting the project completed.\nPatients have told the BBC the building desperately needs updating.\nThe rebuild of Kettering General Hospital was one of the 40 \"new\" hospital schemes announced by the last government in 2020.\nThe government allocated \u00a3315m to fund the hospital works, on top of \u00a349m for a new A&E department.\nConcerns have been voiced about the progress of the work and Kettering's former Conservative MP Philip Hollobone raised the issue in the House of Commons several times.\nWork started earlier this year on an electrically-powered energy centre to serve the new building, but construction of the replacement building is not likely to start until 2026.\nMs Wrighting, elected as the Labour MP for Kettering last week, said she had chosen the hospital as her first visit.\nShe added: \"We've had a tour round today and it's given me a really good insight into the needs of the hospital.\n\"During the [election] campaign, I spoke with Wes Streeting and the health team, and that is a commitment we have made - to get the redevelopment of Kettering General done.\"\nShe added that the new hospital programme had been \"mismanaged over the last five years - promises have been made and they haven't been delivered and this is an opportunity now for me to be the MP that gets this done\".\nVictoria Gourley, 41, a user of the hospital, told the BBC: \"It needs a lot of work doing - it is old, it needs everything. \n\"It's too hot, there's no air con, it's in the same condition it was in the eighties.\"\nAnother patient, Jill Henderson, said a rebuild was \"desperately, badly\" needed.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "There was not much time to rest for a newly elected MP, as he was called out to a mountain rescue less than 24 hours after being voted in.\nJosh MacAlister was elected for Cumbria's Workington and Whitehaven constituency at about 02:15 BST on Friday.\nThe Labour MP said he was looking forward to a relaxing afternoon and an early night after staying up late, but instead he was responding to a call-out at 23:00 BST.\nMr MacAlister said: \"I hadn't been able to do any call-outs during the election period and prior to that I had had a shoulder injury, so I thought this was my first opportunity to go out for a long time.\"\nThe casualty Mr MacAlister and his teammates were called to was airlifted to hospital in Carlisle and is believed to be recovering, he said.\nThe new MP was back home by 02:30 BST, about 24 hours after being officially elected to the role.\nHe added he was \"well and truly\" ready to go to bed by the time he returned.\n\"I had had enough adrenaline and enough late nights for a considerable period of time,\" he joked.\nMr MacAlister has been part of the mountain rescue team for three years, and said he intended on continuing in the role when in the area.\nHe said he became involved, like many others do, because of his love of the fells and the desire to help people.\n\"I really love doing it, I'm going to try to continue being involved as much as I can as a Member of Parliament.\"\nHe added the tasks carried out as a mountain rescue volunteer were much more practical, and he was hoping that doing the two things together would give him some balance.\nWhen asked how he would react if a casualty recognised him as their MP, he said: \"I think it's so out of context that I'm hoping it doesn't happen - I'd rather not distract them, but actually sometimes people are in quite a lot of pain, so the distraction might be useful.\n\"I'm just keen to muck in with the team and do my bit.\"\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "The family and friends of a student who took her own life have called on the next government to prioritise mental health support for young people in schools, colleges and universities.\nAmelia Butlin, 19, from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, was a bubbly, outgoing and popular teenager who was in her first year at university, with lots of friends and a family who loved her.\nShe had ADHD and struggled with anxiety and depression, and after the pandemic had found it difficult to separate herself from social media and her mobile phone. In October, she died by suicide.\n\"[Politicians] need to wake up to the mental health crisis they're facing,\" said Amelia's mother, Becci Butlin.\n\"This generation is the first that is using social media in unbelievable ways and with unbelievable dependency on it,\" she added.\n\"They've got all the other stresses of life, they had a difficult teenage period with Covid and there are significantly more mental health issues to come.\n\"No-one's talking about it. It's a much wider problem than anyone acknowledges.\"\nNaomi Woodford, a mental health support worker at Cedars Upper School, in Leighton Buzzard, which Amelia attended, was among many people who have contacted the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote to tell us mental health is the most important issue for them during this election. \nMs Woodford works with children and teenagers, some of whom have been affected by the death of Amelia, and believes every school, college and university in the UK should have its own mental health provision.\nShe described the situation as a \"national crisis\", and expressed concern that out of 14 schools in the Leighton Buzzard area, only two or three have the resources to offer pupils mental health support.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, in 2021 more people in England and Wales died by suicide than in 2020. \nThe data showed 6.9% more deaths by suicide were registered than in 2020.\nAmelia's mother said she was not aware of mental health care being a key priority for any of the main parties, but believed the next government should focus on the approach in schools and by GPs, to ensure those in need of specialist care get a referral as soon as possible.\n\"The real problem is the complexity of getting the right help,\" said Ms Butlin.\n\"Schools aren't equipped for helping children and teenagers and Amelia had left school, so that is even worse. \n\"If you go through the NHS you are met with huge waiting lists, if you go the private route then there is no-one guiding you.\"\nMs Butlin recently joined 25 of her daughter's friends on a 15km (nine mile) walk in Amelia's memory and to raise money for the suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably \n\"We've seen the impact suicide has - it has rippled through her friendship group and the community,\" Ms Butlin added.\n\"It is important in tragic circumstances to bring people together to do something positive and tangible, and to have that focus that other lives might be saved.\"\nAlicia Down, 19, a friend of Amelia's, said: \"Amelia was the loss of our lives, it's been heartbreaking.\"\n\"We've struggled a lot; it has a domino effect. \n\"When she passed away all of us got the same feelings of depression.\n\"Losing her has ripped us all to shreds and ruined us, and she is constantly on our minds.\"\nMs Down expressed concern over social media and its impact on young people's confidence, and said schools and universities were not equipped to offer support when people needed help. \nIf counselling was offered, she said, it was \"six sessions, and then you're off\".\nCharlotte Millar, 20, a university student, said that many young people were not prepared for university life.\nWhile her and Amelia's friendship circle stayed in touch and supported each other through the pandemic, they were then launched into the stress of A-levels and moving to university.\n\"No matter how independent you think you are, you have no idea what's to come at university,\" she said. \n\"You have to make new friends, study and live on your own. \n\"That's my biggest stress, but you're not defined by a degree and that's not spoken about enough.\"\nShe understood that asking for help was not easy, but universities could also be more flexible when students felt \"swamped\".\nEmily Ferguson, 20, a friend of Amelia's, said she found it hard to put down her phone and ignore social media. \n\"There is such a pressure to be a certain way, so it's difficult to feel that you're fine as you are,\" she said.\n\"You see people always going out at uni, but you don't have to go on every student night out, every party, you can just go home if you want to.\n \"A lot of people want to post about what they're doing, but then they don't appreciate the time with whoever they're with.\n\"You don't have to prove to the world - people don't care that much.\"\nMs Woodford said: \"The community of Leighton Buzzard and Cedars has been deeply affected over the years with young people taking their lives.\n\"We have seen a rise in the range and",
    "More than 130 wild animals, including at least six rare rhinos, have died in flooding at a national park in north-eastern India, officials say.\nThe Kaziranga National Park in Assam is experiencing its worst deluge in recent years.\nThe dead animals - many of whom died by drowning - include 117 hog deer,  two sambar deer, a rhesus macaque and an otter.\nIn 2017, more than 350 animals died due to floods in the park and vehicle collisions during migration through animal corridors to the highlands.\nOfficials say they have rescued 97 animals from flood waters - 25 of them are receiving medical care while 52 others have been released after treatment. \nKaziranga is home to the world's largest population of one-horned rhinos, which were nearly extinct at the turn of the century. It's a Unesco World Heritage site, with over 2,400 one-horned rhinos.\nThe park is also a tiger reserve and home to elephants, wild water buffalo and numerous bird species.

    "Tributes have been paid to a commentator who covered football and speedway for more than 40 years.\nEdwin Overland, who joined BBC Radio Cambridgeshire in 1982, died over the weekend.\nHe covered hundreds of Peterborough United matches during his career, including the play-off wins in 1992, 2000 and 2011.\nPeter Swan, the sports editor at the station, described him as a \"genuine legend\".\nMr Overland trained as a teacher and spent 23 years as a deputy head teacher in a village near Wisbech in Cambridgeshire.\nWhile working in education, he started commentating on football matches for emerging video companies.\nHe also recorded speedway commentaries and sold the tapes to the public.\nWhen BBC Radio Cambridgeshire was launched in 1982, he sent copies of his football commentaries to the station and became the voice of Cambridge United's matches.\nAmong the highlights of those days were FA Cup ties against Arsenal and Crystal Palace.\nWhen the radio station's Peterborough United commentator left, Mr Overland moved over to cover the Posh, and left his teaching career behind.\nHe retired from football commentary in 2022 but continued with his speedway work covering King's Lynn Stars for BBC Radio Norfolk and Peterborough Panthers for BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.\nMr Swan said: \"Edwin played a huge part in our sports coverage over several decades.\n\"To use football parlance, he was a genuine BBC Radio Cambridgeshire legend.\n\"He was an absolute joy to work with and will be missed hugely.\"\nKing's Lynn Stars also paid tribute, with a spokesperson saying the speedway team was \"deeply saddened\" to hear of Mr Overland's death.\n\"Edwin had one of the most recognisable and authoritative voices in the sport, and he gave lengthy service to both the Stars and Peterborough - always maintaining 100% professionalism earning him full respect between supporters of both clubs,\" they said.\nWriting on social media, the speedway author Martin Rogers said he produced \"arguably the most polished and professional speedway commentaries in the market\".\nForever Posh, the official supporters club of Peterborough United, described him as \"the gentleman of sport\".\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Warning: This story contains information which some readers may find offensive\nAn African woman has said her family is one of eight to have moved out of their Antrim homes in the past week following a spate of racist attacks.\nTwo of the families told BBC News NI of their fears after anti-immigration posters were erected in the Ballycraigy estate and houses were spray painted with a black X.\nOne couple and their two children, who lived in the area for more than a year, said they feared they would be killed after attacks on their home escalated in the last six weeks.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said a team of detectives are leading on a \"robust investigation\" following a \"spate of hate crime incidents in the area over the last few weeks\".\nMiriam, not her real name, rented a home from a private landlord when she moved to Northern Ireland 20 months ago to work in the health service. \nHer husband, Andrew, not his real name, and their two children joined her six months later.\nMiriam and Andrew say the intimidation began at the end of May when anti-immigrant posters were erected in the area.\nFrom that time on, they believe the targeting of their family\u2019s home and property intensified.\nThe posters, which were taped to lamp posts, addressed landlords, housing associations, and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.\nThey read: \"We have had enough of undesirables and immigrants being placed in our community. The time has come for locals only\u201d.\nThe posters also warned that \"action will be taken\".\nShe thought maybe a meeting would be organised for landlords in the area.\nBut she said she now understands it was directed at newcomers, like her family.\nTwo weeks later, on 6 June, a large black X was spray-painted on their living room window.\nOn 26 June, a printed poster was taped to the window.\nIt read: \u201cIt is not racist to look after your own.\u201d There was a Northern Ireland flag printed below the message.\nOn 2 July, the windows of their car were smashed.\nThe couple said they have now moved out and will not be returning to the area.\n\u201cNobody told us this was a no-go area for foreigners, that this place has been known for years that foreigners are not welcome,\" said Miriam.\nThe couple said over the last six weeks, they felt like \u201cprisoners in their own home\u201d.\nAndrew said his children had to be accompanied to the shops.\n\u201cHow can this happen in a democratic society?\"\nMiriam says the situation is affecting every part of her life.\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to report to work in this situation,\" she said.\n\"My family is not safe. My children are not safe.\n\"I am afraid to see my children walking outside. I don\u2019t know what is the next step.\n\u201cWhat crime have you committed? I am working, paying taxes. After all that, they come to attack me in the night.\n\u201cWhat offence have I committed to deserve all this?\u201d\nLast weekend, a bungalow specially designed for a nine-year-old disabled boy was one of two new-build properties damaged in what police said was a \"sectarian-motivated hate crime\".\nAnd BBC News NI has learned that other African families in the area have had their properties attacked.\nCaroline, also not her real name, her husband and two children moved to Northern Ireland from Africa two years ago.\nShe first noticed anti-immigration posters six weeks ago.\n\u201cMy eldest came to me and said: \u2018Mummy, do you know what\u2019s happening?

    "More than 50 women have spoken of their traumatic childbirth experiences in a campaign to highlight what they say are poor maternity services in Oxfordshire.\nThe Keep the Horton General (KTHG) campaign group wants full maternity services to be reinstated at Horton General Hospital, in Banbury, after it was changed to a midwife-led unit in 2016.\nIn March, the unit was downgraded to \"requires improvement\" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) after the health watchdog concluded babies were at risk of harm due to \u201cpoor governance and ineffective systems\u201d.  The hospital said it was improving.\nAfter being interviewed by the BBC earlier this year, mother-of-one Beth Hopper says she was contacted by other women, who told her their own harrowing birth experiences at two hospitals run by Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.\nHere are three of their accounts of what they say happened to them.\n\nIn 2018, Beth Hopper, 35, from Banbury, had a difficult pregnancy that required numerous appointments at the John Radcliffe Hospital (JR), about 30 miles away in Oxford.\nShe says she saw a different doctor each time and that her notes were not always read or communicated between departments.\nAt 25 weeks pregnant, she told the BBC that she attended a routine appointment where she says was vigorously examined by a locum doctor, despite telling him she had been experiencing bleeding and pain.\nAfterwards, she said she felt very strange and uncomfortable.\nThe following night, she described how her waters broke and she lost a large blood clot.\nBeth says she went to the JR maternity assessment unit, where she was scanned and her baby's heartbeat was detected.\nShe says no checks were carried out overnight and, by the next morning, she couldn't feel her baby move. Neither a midwife support assistant nor a midwife could apparently find a heartbeat.\n\"They had to go and find a doctor and he couldn't find one either,\" she says.\n\"Then he went to find a mobile full-scanning unit to confirm our baby had died.\n\"This was done on the observation ward, opposite a pregnant mother and a mother with her new baby next to me.\n\"I was on my own because my husband had been sent home, so it was a very public place to receive that news.\"\nShe says staff managed to find her a private room by the afternoon but Beth describes the whole experience as traumatising and says it left her with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\nBeth says some of the other women's experiences have been equally harrowing.\n\"Mothers are saying they're having medical procedures almost against their will, having to sign things when they're in the throes of labour,\" she says.\nShauna Vincent, 30, from Banbury, told the BBC she was 21 weeks pregnant with her third child in March, when she started spotting.\nShe says that at the JR, staff were unable to find a heartbeat during an ultrasound scan. She says she was given a pill to help remove the remains of her baby and told to return to the hospital in two days' time.\n\"When I left, I was quite distraught, I cried the whole way home,\" says Shauna.\nOn the journey home with her partner, her waters broke. She made it to her bathroom before she started bleeding heavily. By the time an ambulance arrived 15 minutes later, she had already passed her baby but says paramedics were not allowed to cut the umbilical cord.\nBack at the JR, Shauna says she was given a general anaesthetic to allow doctors to remove the placenta and she was then moved to the delivery suite.\n\"When I came round, obviously I didn't know what was going on,\" she says.\n\"I woke up and the baby was next to me in a cold cot. I didn't know what to expect because I'd never been in that situation before, to wake up with a dead baby next to me.\"\nShe says staff carried out observation checks on her every two hours, \"with crying babies all around me\".\n\"I couldn't sleep, it was awful, but they [hospital staff] refused to take me to the bereavement ward because I needed to have extra observations which they said they couldn't do there.\"\nThe next morning, Shauna was eventually moved to the bereavement ward but she says it was infested with flies.\nShe was later offered an iron transfusion because of the blood she had lost but it would have meant returning to the delivery ward, so she refused.\nShe says it has been more than 16 weeks and she has still not received her baby's autopsy report, despite chasing the hospital for it.\n\"I felt because my baby had died, they didn't care.\"\nSingle mum-of-four Andrea Ellis, from Banbury, suffered a miscarriage in July 2020, during the Covid pandemic.\nA scan at the Horton confirmed the 37-year-old had lost her baby. A week later, she started to bleed heavily at home. She says she called an ambulance and sat in the bath, sobbing.\nAt the hospital, she passed out in the bathroom and was rushed to theatre for a blood transfusion.\n\"The next thing I know, I'm waking up in resuscitation with all these people around me, not knowing what was going on.\n\"Nobod",
    "As the sun rose on Friday, Wolverhampton woke up to Labour victories in all three of its constituencies after two of them were won by the Conservatives in 2019.\nWolverhampton was a key battleground in the lead up to polling day as Labour sought to reclaim dominance in what had been a traditional stronghold for their party until the previous election.\nHowever voter turnout was notably down in all three constituencies - most strikingly in Wolverhampton West where turnout was down by 11.3%.\nWhile the city is now completely red, with Warinder Juss and Sureena Brackenridge joining Pat McFadden as Labour MPs, the number of votes for Labour were actually lower in two of the three constituencies compared to the 2019 election.\nIn Wolverhampton West, Warinder Juss won with 19,331 votes - fewer than the 23,197 Labour achieved in 2019 when they lost to the Tories.\nPat McFadden held on to his seat in Wolverhampton South East, an area which has elected a Labour MP at every general election since 1945, but with a reduced majority.\nIn Wolverhampton North East, Sureena Brackenridge ousted Jane Stevenson but her total number of votes this time were only slightly more than Labour's total in 2019, when Stevenson was elected for the Tories.\nLabour votes in the city have either stagnated or fallen compared to five years ago with the party's wins in this election thanks to the plummeting Tory votes in the city.\nIn the aftermath of the election the BBC spoke to voters in Wolverhampton, many of whom were sceptical about the future - even residents who had voted Labour.\nRav Chandar told the BBC he had voted Labour reluctantly this time and his wife Jaz Chandar did not vote.\n\"It's not exactly because I wanted to,\" he said, \"but I'm guessing more of a majority support [them] so I went along with them.\n\"It is what it is, we've just got to see.\"\nAt the market, Anne Pyatt runs a home baking stall selling cakes and brownies. \nShe said she was pleased with the result but did feel a bit apprehensive.\n\"I voted Labour but you just don\u2019t know how things are going to go,\" she said. \n\"It always seems like when we get a new government it\u2019s all right for a few years then it starts to go pear-shaped.\"\nOne Tory voter, Jimmy Singh, owner of Jack's Cafe, said: \"I voted Conservative. Obviously we knew Labour was going to win. \n\"My concern was they're going to put minimum wage up which is all right but [when] minimum wage goes up, everything else is going to go up.\"\nReform UK came second in Wolverhampton South East, a constituency where 71% of voters in the Brexit referendum voted Leave.\nIn Wolverhampton North East, where the same percentage of voters had voted Leave, Reform came third with 1,100 votes fewer than the Conservatives.\nGraham Wood told the BBC he had voted for Reform, rejecting the idea that it was a protest vote and a one-off.\n\"Why shouldn't we have a change? The Tories and Labour promise everything, we never get it,\" he said.\n\"They're gonna say taxes won't go up but they will go up. We will be taxed.\"\nAlan Jackson, who had voted Labour ever since he was able to vote, believed the country needed an alternative to Labour and the Conservatives so he voted for Reform.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a great fan of Keir Starmer and I don\u2019t think they are going to do anything about one of the biggest things, immigration,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Wolverhampton & Black Country on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The King, the Prime Minister and Hollywood star Idris Elba have been listening to young people talk about how they deal with the impacts of youth violence and the difficulties of modern life in Britain.\nAt St James's Palace on Friday, young people who have worked with the Prince's Trust - now called the King's Trust - spoke of their own difficult starts in life.\nThey were encouraged to try and continue supporting each other in their communities, and the value of mentorship was highlighted.\nKing Charles told the group: \"It seems to me that the great ambition now should be to join up all the dots and bring everybody involved in to find the right solution.\"\n\"I am very grateful for you all coming today and helping with all of this, particularly for those who have been through the process and experienced so much in their lives,\" King Charles added.\nAlso at the meeting organised by the King and Ebla, were Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy.\nThe 51-year-old actor from Hackney, east London, said governments, both past and present, had been willing to listen to the issues, but \"right now is a moment for change not talk\".\nHe said: \"This topic has always had a spike in interest when we lose a life. \n\"I think where we are right now... our country is wanting to have some change and is consistently banging on that door for change.\"\nHe added: \"The truth is it is my honour to have young people at the table and having their voice to be part of this, because it is really, really important that you guys speak up.\"\nElba, who as a teenager was given a \u00a31,500 grant by The Prince's Trust to go to the National Youth Music Theatre, said: \"I am a product of intervention.\n\"When I was 15 years old, The Prince's Trust gave me an opportunity and that opportunity came from a drama teacher who was a mentor.\"\nHe said that \"everyone in this room is an intervention tool\" and encouraged them to persevere and to \"keep your voices alive\".\nSir Keir Starmer said his government was \"utterly determined\" to tackle the issue, adding that the \"most important voices around this table are the young people here who have told (about) their experiences\".\nHe told the youngsters: \"I have been to many events like this where people like me think we know what the answer is, but we don't.\n\"We need to listen and that is why the most important voices around this table are the young people here who have told their experiences.\n\"We need to listen, take it in and reflect on that.\n\"We have got to turn this into action, as the one thing that frustrates me is just to have the same conversation.\"\nHe told the young people they had the right to \"push\" him and his top politicians about the pledges and measures which are supposed to help improve their lives.\nPoliticians need to be accountable and young people have the right to say \"just get on with it\", Sir Keir told them.\nEarlier, Charles and Elba spoke with each other about the ongoing work of The Trust.\nThey also talked about the work being done together by the Prince's Trust International and the Elba Hope Foundation in Sierra Leone.\nCharles and Elba joined the youngsters for a group photograph at the end of the event where they held up England shirts and wished the national team good luck in Sunday's Euro 2024 against Spain.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Residents and businesses affected by a 16-month road closure said it was a relief to have things back to normal. \nThe \u00a337m project between junction 47A at Haughley and junction 49 at Tot Hill in Suffolk included a total rebuild of the road.\nNational Highways fully reopened the section of road on Saturday.\nDuncan Perry, chairman of Wetherden parish council, said the village had been used as a \"rat run\" but after the road reopened the village was now \"peaceful\".\nMr Perry said some homes were damaged, people found it difficult to sleep and others reported mental health issues as a result of the increased traffic.\n\"The village got used as a rat run by lots of vehicles coming off the A14 but also a lot of local traffic that didn't want to go through those roadworks. \n\"So you had the pleasure of large container vehicles coming through the village and the streets really aren't wide enough for that.\n\"A lot of the houses bordering the main road don't have proper foundations and so forth. \n\"They were built back in the 1500s and 1600s and they didn't think of HGVs and such, so there was a lot of damage to houses.\n\"Now, it's peaceful, quiet and back to normality,\" he added.\nRob Cook, logistics manager at Precon Products, based near Elmswell, said the roadworks affected the business, with drivers getting stuck in queues while parts of the road were shut.\nHe said: \"It has been difficult. \n \"One of the main issues [has been] getting trucks back each day to load up and have timely loading and then getting them back out and our drivers getting out to get to their deliveries.\"\nHe said there had been a \"big financial cost\", largely due to overtime for staff. \nThe road reopening fully was a \"big sigh of relief\", he added.\nNational Highways said: \"We understand the impact of roadworks on this scale and apologise for the inconvenience caused.\"\nIt said it tried to reduce diverting traffic on to local roads and that the changes would improve safety and extend the road life.\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A woman accused of lying to get a job as a senior nurse at a neonatal unit had told a court she was suspended days after raising bullying concerns.\nTanya Nasir, 45, from Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, is on trial at Cardiff Crown Court, accused of nine counts of fraud and false representation.\nShe was suspended as ward manager at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend in February 2020 after concerns were raised about her CV and the date of her registration as a nurse.\nMs Nasir told the court she did not falsify her experience and qualifications to get the job. \nMs Nasir resigned two days before a hospital disciplinary hearing and was arrested on suspicion of fraud in April 2021.\nShe said she was fully qualified for the role in the neonatal unit and said she was suspended two days after voicing concerns about other nurses on the unit being bullied.\nShe said a \"matriarch\" of nurses held power on the unit and she had not realised the full scale of the problems until she started working in the unit in September 2019.\nShe added: \"There was a clear hierarchy in the ward. Some of the nurses were being bullied and picked on by this matriarch group, they were criticised constantly, they were working in fear.\"\nThe court heard she said she could not talk to the neonatal matron Sian Townsend, because she was part of the \"matriarch group,\" so she went to a senior manager.\n\"I raised my concerns, but she rearranged the meeting and two days later I was suspended,\" she said.\nShe told the court she decided to become a nurse after spending time in a refuge with her two children, adding she was forced to leave her family home because of \"violent, alcoholic\" former partner.\nShe added: \"The reason I started my nursing is because of the people in the refuge.

On Saturday night Castlemilk's own Gerry Cinnamon will wrap up the night, while Calvin Harris closes the weekend bash on Sunday night.\nNeither has headlined TRNSMT before, but both are familiar with massive gigs, having each headlined shows at Hampden Park in the past.\nCinnamon - real name Gerry Crosbie - has worked his way up from small stage appearances at TRNSMT predecessor T In The Park to become one of the country's most popular acts.\nArmed only with his guitar and a variety of loop pedals, he'll deliver a set of material from his two mega selling albums so far, but fans will be keen to see if he drops any new material, with four years having passed since the release of his chart-topping sophomore album The Bonny. \nHarris - real name Adam Wiles - was one of the headliners at the final T In The Park back in 2016. \nA relentless hitmaker, the Dumfries-born DJ landed yet another chart-topper last year with his Ellie Goulding trance team-up Miracle - his 11th No 1 in a wildly successful career.\nWhether any of his collaborators - like pop royalty Dua Lipa and Sam Smith - will drop by Glasgow Green remains to be seen.          \nA plethora of acts are booked to appear over the weekend, with soul singer Jalen Ngonda opening up the main stage on Friday.\nAmong other highlights on Friday are Garbage, fronted by Scottish rock queen Shirley Manson, Whitburn indie band the Snuts and fast-rising art-rock quintet the Last Dinner Party. The London group nabbed a No 1 album earlier this year with their debut release Prelude to Ecstasy. \nLook out for pop icons Sugababes, who play the Main Stage - the trio's recent Glastonbury set saw their section of the field closed off due to demand being so high. Lesser known names include post-punk singer Heartworms and songstress Nieve Ella.    \nSaturday's line-up boasts the anthemic sing-a-longs of the Courteeners, a band long adored in Scotland. They'll be joined by Rick Astley, currently enjoying a career renaissance and guaranteed to spark a massive sing-a-long to Never Gonna Give You Up, along with Natasha Bedingfield's pop hits and the bawdy folk of the Mary Wallopers.\nSunday brings drum n' bass duo Chase N Status to the main stage, while Alison Goldfrapp's dancefloor filling pop should brighten up the afternoon. \nRising Irish singer CMAT will add a touch of country to the festival, and alt-pop songstress Rachel Chinouriri has already made a name for herself on TikTok.\nThere are three stages at TRNSMT - the Main Stage, the King Tut's Stage and the River Stage.\nThe Main Stage is devoted to the festival's big hitters, King Tut's brings together a mix of established names and emerging talent, and the River stage is focused on new and emerging talent, mostly Scottish.\nThere's also the Boogie Bar, with a variety of DJ's performing all weekend.\nThe festival has a West Entrance via the city's Saltmarket, and an East entrance off Templeton Street.  \nGates should open at noon each day, last entry to the site is 21.30 and curfew each night is at 23:00.  \nBBC Weather presenter Christopher Blanchett breaks the all-important weather news.\nThankfully there should be no repeat of last year's thunderstorm warnings.\n\"The forecast for TRNSMT looks mostly cloudy with occasional showers. and a little light rain for Sunday,\" he says.\nHere's the breakdown:\nFriday - Early sunny spells with variable cloud.

    "Police in New York state have shot dead a 13-year-old boy after he ran from police while holding a replica handgun, authorities said. \nOfficers stopped Nyah Mway and another 13-year-old on Friday night as the pair matched descriptions of suspects wanted for recent robberies in Utica, police said.\nAs the officers questioned the boys, Nyah Mway fled on foot and a chase ensued. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said police spotted what \"appeared to be a handgun\".\nOne officer then wrestled the boy to the floor. \u201cDuring a ground struggle\u201d, another officer fired a single shot that hit the teenager in the chest, the police chief said. \nHe was given first aid at the scene but later died at Wynn Hospital.\nPolice released several minutes of body camera footage on Saturday night, from all the officers' cameras. \nIt came shortly after outraged members of the local community heckled the Utica police chief at a press conference, which was attended by the boy's family.\nA candlelight vigil attended by hundreds was held for Mway on Saturday evening, local news reported. \nSpeaker Kay Klo, director at Midtown Utica Community Center, said Mway was \"tragically murdered by police officers\". Calls for \"justice\" were yelled by the crowd.\nUtica Mayor Michael Galime called for calm, saying: \"We understand the weight of this situation and want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood.\"\nThe footage appears to show the teenager pointing what police say was the replica weapon, while running away. The officers can be heard shouting \"gun!\" to each other.\nThe officers believed they had seen a real handgun, police said - but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 weapon that could only fire pellets or BB\u2019s.\nThe three officers involved were on a patrol of the West Utica area assisting with two recent robbery investigations nearby.\nIn one of the incidents on 27 June, two men armed with a black firearm forcibly demanded and stole property from victims. The suspects were described as an Asian male and a dark-skinned male - one travelling by foot and one on a bicycle.\nAuthorities say they stopped Nyah Mway and the other teenager based on these \"identifying factors\" at around 22:00 local time.\nThe officers involved have been named as Patrick Husnay, who fired the fatal shot, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti. They have been placed on administrative leave.\nThe shooting is being investigated by both the New York attorney general's office and Utica police. ",
    "A teacher who sexually abused two schoolboys and became pregnant by one of them has been jailed.\nRebecca Joynes groomed both boys from the age of 15, first exchanging messages on social media, Manchester Crown Court heard.\nThe 30-year-old was previously convicted of four counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of sexual activity with another child.\nJoynes cried and shook in the dock as she was sentenced to six-and-a-half years. \nThe trial heard that Joynes was 28 when she had come out of a nine-year relationship and was \"flattered\" by the attention of teenage schoolboys.\nNeither teenager - known as Boy A and Boy B throughout the trial - can be identified due to their age. \nJoynes gave birth to Boy B's baby in early 2024, with the child being taken away from her within 24 hours.\nIn a victim impact statement, Boy B said \"one of the hardest things\" was not being told anything about the baby.\nHe added: \"I struggled to come to terms with my abuse, I was completely in denial.\"\nDuring the trial, he said he felt he had \"betrayed someone I love and done wrong by giving evidence\" but had since realised \"the full extent\" of the abuse and \"tactics used\". \nHe said he was \"coerced, controlled, manipulated, sexually abused, and mentally abused\", adding: \"I will forever be Rebecca\u2018s victim and forever linked to her through our child.\" \nAt the sentencing hearing, the judge, Kate Cornell, told Joynes: \"You were the adult, the person in control. \n\"You should have known better. You failed to enforce the boundaries of proper conduct but deliberately transgressed them.\"\nThe trial heard Joynes would \"laugh off\" inappropriate comments instead of shutting down the behaviour.\nShe gave Boy A all but one of the digits of her mobile phone number as a maths problem-solving exercise in which he had to work out the final digit.\nThey then connected on Snapchat and he sent her flirtatious texts, with the pair agreeing to meet in secret.\nBoy A lied to his mother that he was staying at a friend's house after school but instead Joynes picked him up and took him to the Trafford Centre, where she bought him a \u00a3350 Gucci belt.\nJudge Cornell said CCTV footage of Joynes buying the belt showed that \"your flirtatious body language and eye contact could hardly be a clearer indication of grooming behaviour\".\nBack at her flat Joynes had sex twice with Boy A.\nThe next day the boy's mother noticed a love-bite on her son's neck, which he dismissed as \"nothing\".\nThe court heard she stormed into school reception as police were called in about the case.\nJoynes was then bailed on condition she would have no unsupervised contact with anyone under 18.\nShe told the trial she then moved back to her parents in Wirral after having a \"breakdown\" and she was at a low point when Boy B messaged her on Snapchat.  \nHe later told police they regularly had unprotected sex at her Salford Quays flat and that Joynes had told him she could not become pregnant. \nJoynes was arrested for breaking bail conditions and spent five months in custody until she was bailed in November last year.\nBoy B said in his statement there had been a \"massive mental toll\" on him and his family.  \nHe said he had been told by social services that Joynes had refused to let them update him about the baby's due date, gender or health. \n\"The thought of not being able to see my child was heartbreaking,\u201d he added.\nJudge Cornell said Joynes was a \"high achiever\" who had thrown her career away and had her baby taken away from her through her own actions.\n\"You felt buoyed and boosted by their attention,\" she added. \n\"There's no real insight from you, you continue to deny the offences and have been silent on the distressing impact on these boys.\"  \nDet Con Beth Alexander, from Greater Manchester Police, said: \"School should be a place of safety for children.\n\"It\u2019s clear from some of the public commentary when Joynes was convicted that there is still a lack of understanding when it comes to men and boys being the victims of sexual offences.\n\"They have had to read comments stating others are 'jealous' of them, and that they 'should be happy a young female teacher was interested in them', and this rhetoric is very damaging and dangerous.\n\"Women can still be paedophiles; this term is not reserved only for men. Men and boys can still be victims of sexual abuse.\u201d\nAdditional reporting from PA News. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Cambodia has jailed 10 environmental activists who had sounded the alarm on river pollution for plotting against the government - a case critics have decried as politically motivated.\nMembers of the group Mother Nature were charged in 2021 after they documented waste run-off into Phnom Penh's Tonle Sap river, near the royal palace.\nThree of them, including Spanish co-founder Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, who were also convicted of insulting the king, were sentenced to eight years' jail and fined $2,500 (\u00a31,980). The seven others were handed six-year terms.\nProsecutors have never explained how the activists had violated the law against insulting the king or conspiring against the government.\nSince its founding in 2013, Mother Nature has campaigned against environmentally destructive projects and raised questions on how natural resources are managed in the South East Asian country.\nThey document their findings in playful and informative videos that they post on Facebook, where they have 457,000 followers.\nEnvironmental groups have long accused Cambodia's leaders of profiting from the country's natural resources. The government denies this and says Mother Nature is encouraging social unrest.\nGonzalez-Davidson, who was earlier banned from entering Cambodia, called the verdict a \"disastrous decision by the Hun family regime\". \n\"No one benefits from [it], let alone the government. As we have seen with previous cases like this, this tends to send people into shock for a while, but ultimately backfires because it inspires many others to take [the jailed activists'] place,\" he told the BBC.\nCambodia's law against insulting the king is relatively new and took effect only in 2018. Critics say it is being used to crack down on dissent. \nOpposition political parties were dismantled, independent media outlets were shut and dozens of activists were jailed under the decades-long rule of former prime minister Hun Sen, who stepped down last year to pave the way for his son, Hun Manet, to assume leadership.\nUnder Hun Manet, Mother Nature activists have continued to criticise what they describe as an unequal enforcement of laws in favour of companies and the wealthy elite.\nFour of the convicted activists attended the hearings and were immediately arrested following the verdict.\nRepresentatives of local NGO the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights (Licadho) who were present outside the Phnom Penh court said the arrests were violent, with \"at least two of [them] dragged by their necks\".\nArrest warrants have been issued for the six others, including Gonzalez-Davidson.\nEarlier in the day, dozens of Mother Nature supporters marched towards the court where the activists were due to receive the verdict. \nDressed in white - the traditional colour of mourning in the country - some of the supporters held up hand-written posters that read \"We need freedom\" and \"We need rights\". Others held white flowers. \nRights groups have denounced the verdict as a blow to Cambodia's diminishing civil society and environmental movement. \nThe verdict \"sends an appalling message to Cambodia\u2019s youth that the government will side with special interests over the environment every chance it gets,\" said Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director Bryony Lau.\n\"It is astounding to criminalise activities of youths who are advocating for clean water in Phnom Penh, protecting mangrove forests in Koh Kong and warning against the privatisation of land in protected areas and characterising it as an attack against the state,\" said Licadho's outreach director Naly Pilorge.\nHowever, she is hopeful that the activists' efforts \"will still inspire other human rights defenders to join the front lines and continue to push for a more democratic Cambodia\". \nSeveral of those convicted today had already served jail terms in the past. One of them, Long Kunthea, told BBC in an interview last year that she is willing to take on the risks of her activism to \"for positive change\". \nKunthea was previously jailed for more than a year for organising protests to protect the Mekong river from further pollution.\n\"This problem on the Mekong is a problem for all of us... I don\u2019t want to see this continue to happen to Cambodia, to Cambodian people, and to our next generation ever again,\u201d she told the BBC.\nOne of Mother Nature's successful campaigns, which Mr Pilorge made reference to, resulted in officials ending the export of sand from the coastal estuaries of  southwestern Koh Kong province, which was destroying the local ecosystem and fishing grounds.\nThey also successfully halted the plan to build a hydro-dam in the Cardamom Mountains. The China-led construction project would have threatened the livelihoods of indigenous communities in the area, the group had said.\nLast September, the group received the Sweden-headquartered Right Livelihood Award for its \"fearless activism\". \"[Mother Nature] has emerged as a beacon of hope for future generations, fighting for the pr",
    "A new exhibition has opened exploring the Egyptian collection owned by Derby Museums and how it came to be here.\nDisplaced: From the Nile to the Derwent will be open to the public until 24 November at Derby Museum and Art Gallery.\nItems including two mummified ancient Egyptians named Pypyu and Pa-sheri and part of a pyramid detached by dynamite blasts form part of the displays.\nThe exhibition explores the ethics of archaeology and the colonial origins of much of the material held by British institutions.\nTony Butler, executive director of Derby Museums, said: \u201cIt explores the history of the collection of ancient Egyptian material at the museum. It\u2019s asking questions about how and why Derby came to house these amazing objects from a country thousands of miles away.\n\u201cThey\u2019re here because we took them, our ancestors took them from Egypt over the last 200 years and much of the material was acquired during the colonial period.\n\u201cMany Europeans went to places like Luxor or Cairo and took material, dug things up.\n\u201cThis exhibition talks about the ethics of archaeology, it tries to correct some of the misconceptions about Egypt, put flesh on the bones about this material.\u201d\nThe exhibition features new research into some of Derby Museum\u2019s most popular items, as well as pieces on loan from other institutions including Manchester Museum, the British Museum and private collections.\nVisitors will be encouraged to share their thoughts about the sometimes challenging histories and ethics surrounding these collections.\nLaura Phillips, head of interpretation and display, added: \u201cA key aspect of the exhibition is understanding with visitors how much they want to see \u2013 giving them the choice about whether to view the mummified remains or everything but, including never before seen CT scans.\u201d\nAs part of the project, schoolchildren in Derby have been connecting with pupils in Egypt.\nRachael Wayne, formal learning programmes coordinator, said: \u201cOur Egypt collections and in particular our mummified people have been very popular with families and schools over many years. We thought it was important to have a children\u2019s voice in the exhibition.\n\u201cWe created a project between Bemrose School and a school in Luxor, Future International School.\n\u201cWe did some live lessons, we did some artwork, the children learnt about each other\u2019s childhood and shared each other's culture.\n\u201cThe children got a deep understanding of our collections, and also each other.\u201d\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A senior detective has called on social media firms to take robust action against \"sinister\" behaviour online, after a man was sentenced for plotting to kidnap, rape and murder Holly Willoughby.\nDet Ch Insp Greg Wood, of Essex Police, said it was \"a really dangerous time online\", with \"so much space\" being \"unmoderated\".\nGavin Plumb, 37, used WhatsApp and Kik to plot how he could attack and ultimately kill the TV presenter.\nA spokesman for WhatsApp said end-to-end encryption meant it could not read users' messages. Kik was contacted for comment.\nPlumb, from Harlow, used a Kik group called Abduct Lovers - which had 50 active members - to meet like-minded people.\nHe was caught by an undercover police officer from the US who had been operating covertly in the forum.\nA subsequent investigation found the defendant had also been using WhatsApp to send highly graphic and sexualised messages about his plan to target Ms Willoughby.\nA jury at Chelmsford Crown Court found the 37-year-old guilty of soliciting murder, inciting rape and inciting kidnap. He was jailed on Friday for a minimum of 16 years.\nMr Wood said social media companies must do more to moderate its users, as \"there isn't an undercover law enforcement officer on every chat room\".\n\"Gavin Plumb was active in a really overt forum called Abduct Lovers \u2013 so it wasn't secret, it wasn't covert,\" he told the BBC.\n\"There is a responsibility on social media companies to take more decisive action against people who are perpetrating crimes overtly in the online space.\n\"If they tell us about it, we'll take action.

    "Overcrowding in prisons will \"force\" the government to change the way it deals with prisoners serving indeterminate sentences, ex-home secretary David Blunkett has said. \nLatest figures show just under the 1,425 free cells in men's prisons needed for the system to run smoothly - jeopardizing safety and rehabilitation efforts.\nAround 2,800 people are still serving Indefinite Sentences for Public Protection (IPPs), reserved for serious sexual and violent offenders, which have no end date.\nLabour peer Lord Blunkett, who introduced IPPs in 2005, said \"radical\" reforms are necessary to address the ongoing crisis.\nOn Friday, the government is expected to announced plans to release some prisoners early, to ease overcrowding.\nUntil now, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has been \"incredibly cautious\" about announcing reforms to IPPs, Lord Blunkett said.\nBut \"the truth of the matter is that they will be absolutely forced\" to act on IPPs to help free up space in prisons, he added.\nIt comes as more than 70 criminal justice experts and organisations have signed an open letter calling on the government to quickly bring in planned reforms on IPPs and consider resentencing people.\nThe letter to the justice secretary said: \"most people serving IPP sentences and their families have lost all trust in the justice system.\n\"This hopelessness has had a devastating impact on the mental health of people serving IPP sentences, both in prison and in the community.\"\nThe new government must decide whether to enact reforms by the Conservative government to reduce IPP prisoners' licence time - where a prisoner is released but still under supervision - from 10 years to three.\nThe measures were passed in the Victims and Prisoners Act in the final hours before Parliament was dissolved for the general election but it cannot take effect until the government sets a commencement date.\nIPPs were introduced in 2005 for serious sexual and violent offenders.\nThe sentences have no end date.\nInstead. IPP prisoners serve a minimum tariff after which they can only be released, on licence, if the Parole Board is satisfied they do not pose a risk to public safety.\nThe sentences were abolished in 2012 after concerns they were being used too widely and that prisoners were spending many years longer than their minimum term in custody.\nHowever, they were not retrospectively cancelled and there is an ongoing debate about what should be done for around 2,800 people who are still serving them in prison. More than 1,000 of those people have never been released.\nLord Blunkett introduced the IPPs but has since said he regretted the way they had been implemented and has called for reform.\nBut Alex Chalk, the Tory ex-justice secretary who oversaw the Victims and Prisoners Act, said there are \"limits\" to safe reforms of the scheme.\nHe called IPPs a \"monstrous injustice\" but told the BBC: \"These people were found to be dangerous, and the parole board say they continue to be dangerous, which is why you have to proceed with caution.\"\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cThe prison system is in crisis and we recognise the significant impact this is having on our whole justice system.\n\u201cIt is right that IPP sentences were abolished. The Lord Chancellor is committed to working with organisations and campaign groups to ensure the appropriate course of action is taken to support those still serving IPP sentences.\"",
    "The parliamentary Conservative party is dazed and confused, even grief-stricken.\nMany knew a big defeat was coming, though some were in denial. All agree that the reality of life in opposition is even worse than expected.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Lehman Brothers around here,\u201d one Conservative MP muttered, as he saw yet another ousted colleague wander past carrying a cardboard box holding their belongings.\n\u201cThere are a load of MPs I thought I\u2019d be spending decades with in this place,\u201d said another. \u201cThey\u2019re really good mates. And almost all of them are gone. It\u2019s a reminder of how vulnerable we all are.\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s one of the few remaining members of the Conservatives\u2019 vast 2019 intake: \u201cIt\u2019s not great to feel like a greybeard when you\u2019ve only been here four-and-a-half years.\u201d\nIt\u2019s in that emotional state that the remaining MPs need to start answering questions about where to go next. But they are in no hurry to do so. Indeed it\u2019s hard even to know what the right questions are.\nMost glaring and immediate, of course, is the question of who should succeed Rishi Sunak. The fact that no-one has yet declared their candidacy - and there appears to be no particular clamour for them to do so - tells its own story.\nAs one shadow cabinet minister put it: \u201cLook at 1997 and look at 2005 - 2005 was a lot longer and went a lot better.\u201d\nIn 1997, the last time the Conservatives were ejected from government, John Major was replaced by William Hague within 49 days. In 2005, it took seven months for David Cameron to be chosen to replace Michael Howard. Lord Hague\u2019s four years as leader were forlorn, Lord Cameron led the Conservatives back into government.\n\u201cThe question I hear people asking each other the most,\u201d one Conservative MP said, \u201cis who is our David Cameron?\u201d\nIn some quarters, the drift towards a longer leadership election betrays a lack of enthusiasm for the likely candidates.\nOne influential backbencher suggested that postponing the start of the contest would allow MPs to see how the putative candidates take to the task of opposition, for example responding in the King\u2019s Speech debate or tabling urgent questions to cabinet ministers.\nFor others, though, a long campaign is an opportunity to have a more fundamental debate about how the Conservatives should rebuild.\n\u201cThe problem is we lost votes everywhere at once,\u201d one MP on the right of the party said. \u201cLots want us to just think about the challenge from Reform, and we must, but we can\u2019t ignore our other former voters.\u201d\nConsider a couple of constituencies for a moment. \nAfter the 2019 general election, Boston and Skegness was the second-safest Conservative seat in the country. The party won 76.7% of the vote with Labour limping in second on 15.2%. Last week Reform UK claimed the seat, even though the Labour vote stayed roughly the same. \nIf every Conservative loss were like that, the party\u2019s clear incentive would be to focus relentlessly on those voters they lost to Reform.\nBut then look at Stratford-on-Avon. At the 2019 election the Conservatives won this seat with 60.6% of the vote, way ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 24.3%. \nLast week, the Liberal Democrats won the seat, the first time anyone but a Conservative had won there since 1906. \nYet the Conservative vote collapsed in more than one direction. Lots of votes were lost to the Liberal Democrats but Reform claimed 14.6% of the vote too. \nIf those votes had gone to the Conservatives, the party would have just clung on to the seat.\nThat\u2019s before you even get on to all the seats where Conservative voters defected in large numbers to Labour.\nBut it\u2019s far from straightforward to assume that Reform votes would have just flowed to the Conservatives without Nigel Farage\u2019s involvement.\n\u201cMost Reform voters don\u2019t like the Conservative Party,\u201d says Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester. \u201cThey courted them for two years and it did nothing.\n\u201cConservatives assume that because most Reform voters backed the Tories in 2019 that they are low-hanging fruit, easy to win back. But this doesn\u2019t follow. They feel let down by the Conservative Party, and just saying nice things to them isn\u2019t going to cut it for them. Even if you can get some of them back you will lose others in doing so.\u201d\nEven those MPs who think the Conservatives need to prioritise the Reform UK vote admit there is uncertainty about what\u2019s behind the party's surge.\n\u201cThe big question about Reform is whether it\u2019s just about immigration,\u201d one MP on the right of the party said, \u201cor whether it\u2019s also about economics and trust. Some of us think it\u2019s something much bigger, a bit like a Marine Le Pen moment.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re right, then it\u2019s no good just pitching for Reform votes by going harder and harder on immigration, because you can never satisfy enough of them, and with some of them you wouldn\u2019t want to. And in the meantime you\u2019re turning off Lib Dems.\u201d\nAnother Conservative said: \u201cThe answer is we need to find a way to appeal to voters we lost to all parti",

    "Key issues such as the NHS, the economy and immigration have dominated this election campaign.\nThey are well covered in all the parties' manifestos, but some other topics only get a few words, or none at all.\nThe BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project was an invitation to tell us what matters to you. Big subjects such as climate change and housing dominated your responses.\nThe parties too have covered those big issues at length, and have responded to the questions asked by voters.\nBut there are other points you raised, albeit in smaller numbers, that barely get a mention in the manifestos. Here is a selection of them.\nYour Voice, Your Vote is not a scientific project, but it does allow you to have your say.\nThese topics are far from the most common in your responses, but carry great strength of feeling.\nDiane from Worcestershire says litter and fly-tipping are at \"epidemic levels\" while Christine, 33, from Surrey is shocked by \"the sheer amount of rubbish everywhere\".\nMartin, 42, from Perthshire asks: \"What are the parties going to do to enforce the law and what new initiatives will be taken to improve this worrying situation? It appears no parties are interested.\"\nThe Conservatives do have a sentence in their manifesto with a proposal to make fly-tipping an offence which would carry a sanction of penalty points on a driving licence.\nWhen it spelled out this policy earlier in the campaign, opposition parties responded with claims that cases had been high but resulted in a low proportion of fines. Labour says fly-tippers will be forced to clean up their mess.\nThere may be good reason why litter and fly-tipping are rarely mentioned. Local councils are primarily responsible for this area of policy, so they were more dominant during local elections earlier in the year.\nAlthough surveys give slightly differing figures on shoplifting, cases are at, or near, the highest level seen for 20 years. \nThe BBC has reported on vulnerable women and children being trafficked to the UK to shoplift for Eastern European crime groups.\nRetail worker Allan wrote to say he faced shoplifting and threatening behaviour on a daily basis.\nAmanda in Bristol says shoplifting has become \"normalised\", but there are contrasting views on the best way to tackle such a crime.\nThe parties do devote whole chapters of their manifestos to how they would deal with crime.\nHowever, there is little mention of shoplifting in particular, although Labour plans to introduce a specific offence of assaults on shopworkers.\nScotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man are all considering changing the law to let terminally ill people end their lives.\nCampaigner Dame Esther Rantzen wants Westminster MPs to vote on assisted dying too, while Liz Carr, a comedian, actress and disability rights campaigner, has been a vocal opponent.\nViews on both sides of the debate are clear from your comments. \nLynne from Kent and Anne from Lancashire both ask whether the parties would put legalisation of assisted dying to a referendum, while Oliver, aged 29, from Bedfordshire says it is \"an important social issue\" which has not had an airing in this campaign.\nHowever, John from Devon says it would be \"nonsense\" to allow assisted dying in any form.\nOnly the Greens suggest in their manifesto that a change in the law is needed. The Conservatives describe it as a \"matter of conscience\" - both they, and the Liberal Democrats, say it should go to a free vote in Parliament.\n\"The main issue I'd like to see the parties wake up to is personal tax thresholds,\" says Elizabeth, aged 44, from Cambridgeshire. \n\"Keeping these frozen until 2028 is crippling hard working families and it\u2019s just not fair or right.\"\nNot everyone agrees with Elizabeth, with some people pointing out that tax rises would be necessary to improve essential public services.\nTax thresholds mark the level of income at which different rates of income tax are paid. \nThey have been frozen, when they would normally be expected to rise in line with prices.\nThis issue has been raised regularly during debates, interviews and in commentary, such as this piece by the BBC's economics editor, Faisal Islam, but less so in manifestos.\nLabour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives will all keep the freeze for the next three years. Reform and the Workers Party of Britain say they would raise the starting income tax threshold to \u00a320,000 and \u00a321,200 respectively, although questions have been raised over how this would be funded.\nTax bands differ in Scotland, and the SNP says it wants full devolution of tax powers.\nToni from Devon is among those saying: \"The ban on hunting needs to be strengthened.\"\nFox-hunting has been a major issue in previous election campaigns, before and after it was banned in England and Wales by the Labour government in 2004.\nThere is different legislation in Scotland, and it is still permitted in Northern Ireland.\nLabour and the Greens say they would ban trail hunting, which sees hounds and riders follow a pre-laid scent ",

    "Is your life better after 14 years of Conservative government?\nThat, in a nutshell, was the question Labour asked voters in this general election campaign.\nYou don't need me to tell you that it worked, rather well.\nNow the party is already talking about repeating the feat at the 2026 Scottish parliamentary elections by asking \"is your life better after 19 years under the SNP?\"\n\"This is part one,\" said Sir Keir Starmer in Edinburgh on Sunday, adding: \"part two comes in 2026.\"\nHowever, firing up his party for the Holyrood election campaign was not the main reason for the prime minister's visit to Scotland so soon after taking office.\nHe insists that he wants to reset relations with governments around the UK, hence his decision to make an early dash through Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, as well as meeting English mayors, in his first few days in the job.\nSir Keir is attempting to style himself as the sensible leader of a grown-up government, a man whose watchwords are moderation and co-operation.\nThe intended contrast is not just with politicians on his right but also with those on his left, not least his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, who is back in parliament as an independent.\nIt is striking that Mr Corbyn secured 40% of the vote in 2017 when he lost to Theresa May while Sir Keir's victory was built on a 33.7% share and the second lowest turnout since World War Two.\nIn other words the new prime minister's well of support may be shallower than a majority of 174, just shy of Tony Blair's 1997 landslide, suggests.\nIn fact, Scotland was the only part of the UK where Labour\u2019s vote share rose sharply in this election, jumping by 17 percentage points as the party took 36 seats from the SNP.\nSir Keir retooled a familiar phrase in his address to new Scottish MPs and other supporters in a hotel looking out over Edinburgh Castle.\n\"We won because we campaigned as changed Labour,\" he said, adding: \"And we will govern as changed Labour.\"\nIt was an obvious reference to Sir Tony, who entered Downing Street 27 years ago with the words: \"We ran for office as New Labour, we will govern as New Labour. \"\nBut this is not 1997. \nStarmer has inherited a stagnating economy, with low growth, low productivity and high inequality.\nHe is dealing with the fallout from Covid, the war in Ukraine and Conservative cuts to public spending in response to the financial crisis of 2007/8, known as austerity.\nWinning control of the Scottish government from the SNP at Holyrood in 2026 could yet depend on Labour delivering the change it has promised voters as quickly as possible.\nThat will be a huge challenge when the party has pledged to stick to Conservative spending plans, a point the SNP leader and First Minister John Swinney made repeatedly during the election campaign.\nYesterday, though, both men were stressing co-operation.\nMr Swinney told broadcasters that, on eradicating child poverty, improving public services and tackling climate change, \u201cthere is common ground to be achieved by working collaboratively with the United Kingdom government.\u201d\nSir Keir also sounded positive, focusing on Scotland's only oil refinery at Grangemouth, where hundreds of jobs are under threat.\n\u201cWe discussed the economy. We discussed energy and as you would expect, we discussed Grangemouth,\u201d he said, promising that \u201cour governments will work together on that issue straight away.\u201d\nMore generally, says new Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the way to reinvigorate the economy is growth aligned with an industrial strategy which will include a new publicly-owned green energy company based in Scotland.\nHowever, there is still confusion about whether the proposed \"Great British Energy\" would operate as an actual energy generation company, as Labour originally promised or, as Sir Keir later told BBC Radio Scotland, \"an investment vehicle.\"\nRegardless, trade unions, which have traditionally supported Labour, are worried about the impact on North Sea jobs of an accelerated transition to renewable power.\nThat is not their only concern.\n\"We haven't got time to wait for growth,\" said Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.\n\"People are literally hurting out there, and we're going to have to borrow to invest, and our crumbling public services need money.\"\nThe other big economic issue hanging over Sir Keir as he takes office is the UK's decision \u2013 against Scotland\u2019s wishes \u2013 to end free trading arrangements with its biggest market, the European Union.\nAs he spoke to journalists on a terrace overlooking Edinburgh Castle on Sunday, I asked the prime minister if he had anything practical to say about how he would address the impact of Brexit, which the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates will reduce UK productivity (output per worker) by 4% in the long term.\n\"Yes,\" he replied. \"We intend to improve our relationship with the EU and that means closer trading ties with the EU.\n\"It means closer ties in relati",
    "A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal. \nA former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it.\nThe following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true.\nOlena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; \u00a33.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money.\nThe story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked. \nExperts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it \"fake news\", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story.\nBut before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely.\nOne X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users \u2013 at least 12m in total, according to the site\u2019s metrics.\nIt was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\nOur latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters.\nDozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November\u2019s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress.\nThe story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation \u2013 Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society.\nAnother fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics.\nIt was published on a website called The Houston Post \u2013 one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump\u2019s Florida resort.\nIt played neatly into Trump\u2019s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations.\nExperts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign.\nWhile no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West.\n\u201cRussia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,\u201d said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election.\n\u201cWe're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,\u201d he said.\nThe BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia\u2019s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment.\nSince state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making \u201cfake news\u201d operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible.\nThe operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American \u2013 Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.\n\nMost of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software.\nIn some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: \u201cPlease rewrite this article taking a conservative stance\u201d.\n\nThe stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the intern",
    "Independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has described a Vanity Fair story as a \"lot of garbage\", responding to several allegations including that he had sexually assaulted a former family babysitter.\nVanity Fair reported that in the late 1990s, Mr Kennedy had groped Eliza Cooney, a recent college graduate hired as a part-time babysitter for his children and to assist him with his environmental law work. She was 23 years old at the time.\nWhen asked specifically about this allegation and the others in question on the Breaking Points podcast, Mr Kennedy said, \"I am not a church boy.\"\n\u201cI had a very, very rambunctious youth,\u201d he said. \u201cI said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.\u201d\nWhen pressed by podcast host Saagar Enjeti further on the sexual assault claim, Mr Kennedy said he had no comment.\nThe magazine also reported he had had several extramarital affairs and vigorously defended a cousin, Michael Skakel, who was convicted of murdering a 15-year-old girl in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nMr Kennedy\u2019s campaign pointed reporters to a post on X where he accused the magazine of being in league with Democratic Party leadership.\nWhile discussing the article on the podcast, Mr Kennedy focused on a separate allegation in the story - that he had posed with a barbecued dog while on a trip to Korea, later joking about it in a message to a friend.\nMr Kennedy said the photo had been taken not in Korea but in the Patagonia region of South America, and that the animal pictured was a goat.\nVanity Fair reporter Joe Hagen, who previously wrote a profile of Mr Kennedy for the magazine, said the photo was evidence of Mr Kennedy \u201csimultaneously mocking Korean culture, reveling in animal cruelty, and needlessly risking his reputation and that of his family\u201d.\nThe story also outlined Mr Kennedy\u2019s alleged affairs and included details of drug addiction in his youth, which the candidate has been open about on the trail. \nOn the same podcast, Mr Kennedy \u2013 the son of Robert F Kennedy and nephew of President John F Kennedy - said that although he was committed to running for president as an independent, \u201cthe best path for me to the White House is through the Democratic Party\u201d.\n\u201cI think that would probably be the best choice for everybody and it\u2019s certainly something I would consider\u201d if President Biden were to step aside, he said.\nThe BBC has contacted Vanity Fair for comment.",
    "It's taken until 2024, but Japan has finally said goodbye to floppy disks.\nUp until last month, people were still asked to submit documents to the government using the outdated storage devices, with more than 1,000 regulations requiring their use.\nBut these rules have now finally been scrapped, said Digital Minister Taro Kono.\nIn 2021, Mr Kono had \"declared war\" on floppy disks. On Wednesday, almost three years later, he announced: \"We have won the war on floppy disks!\"\nMr Kono has made it his goal to eliminate old technology since he was appointed to the job. He had earlier also said he would \"get rid of the fax machine\". \nOnce seen as a tech powerhouse, Japan has in recent years lagged in the global wave of digital transformation because of a deep resistance to change.\nFor instance, workplaces have continued to favour fax machines over emails - earlier plans to remove these machines from government offices were scrapped because of pushback. \nThe announcement was widely-discussed on Japanese social media, with one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling floppy disks a \"symbol of an anachronistic administration\". \n\"The government still uses floppy disks? That's so outdated... I guess they're just full of old people,\" read another comment on X. \nOthers comments were more nostalgic. \u201cI wonder if floppy disks will start appearing on auction sites,\u201d one user wrote.\nCreated in the 1960s, the square-shaped devices fell out of fashion in the 1990s as more efficient storage solutions were invented. \nA three-and-a-half inch floppy disk could accommodate up to just 1.44MB of data. More than 22,000 such disks would be needed to replicate a memory stick storing 32GB of information.\nSony, the last manufacturer of the disks, ended its production in 2011. \nAs part of its belated campaign to digitise its bureaucracy, Japan launched a Digital Agency in September 2021, which Mr Kono leads. \nBut Japan's efforts to digitise may be easier said than done. \nMany Japan businesses still require official documents to be endorsed using carved personal stamps called hanko, despite the government's efforts to phase them out. \nPeople are moving away from those stamps at a \"glacial pace\", said local newspaper The Japan Times.\nAnd it was not until 2019 that the country's last pager provider closed its service, with the final private subscriber explaining that it was the preferred method of communication for his elderly mother.",
    "Hilary Benn has been appointed the new Northern Ireland secretary following the Labour Party's general election victory.\nMr Benn is a veteran parliamentarian representing Leeds Central in the House of Commons since 1999 and now the new Leeds South constituency.\nHe had been the shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland since September 2023.\nHe also served in the cabinet from 2003 to 2010 under Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\nMore recently, he served as shadow foreign secretary and chairman of the Brexit select committee.\nMr Benn is the son of former cabinet minister and veteran left-wing campaigner Tony Benn, who also served in Labour cabinets in the 1960s and 70s.\nDuring his time as the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Mr Benn was vocal on issues such as the Legacy Act, the redevelopment of Casement Park and the restoration of power sharing.\nOn Friday, T\u00e1naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin said he had a \"positive\" first call with Mr Benn. \n\"A strong and visible joint approach between the Irish and British governments on Northern Ireland is the bedrock of positive progress and I look forward to working closely with the secretary of state in this respect,\" he said.\n\"We had a constructive conversation on legacy issues and agreed to work together on a path forward.\"\nThe Troubles Legacy Act was passed in September despite opposition from all of Northern Ireland's political parties, several victims' groups and the Labour Party.\nIt ended historical inquests and transferred of Troubles-era cases to a new body known as the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR).\nIt also provided a conditional amnesty for people suspected of crimes committed during the Troubles and introduces a ban on inquests and future civil actions related to the Troubles era.\nThe High Court later ruled this clause was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nIn May, Mr Benn said Labour would remove the immunity element from the act because of the High Court ruling, although he noted the government had appealed.\nMr Benn said his party would also restore civil cases and inquests.\nSpeaking about the ICRIR, he said: \"I would not scrap it, I will see how it goes. In the end the test for this is will it work for families.\n\"In the end if families find that ICRIR works for them - and there are some reforms that we could make to boost confidence in it - then that will put us in a much, much better place than where we are at the moment.\"\nLabour could not \"write a blank cheque\" to rebuild Casement Park in west Belfast in time for Euro 2028, Mr Benn said in June.\nSpeaking to Good Morning Ulster, Mr Benn said everyone \"would like Casement to be built\" in time for the tournament.\nHe said it was not clear what the final cost of the project would be.\nWhen the stadium was first proposed in 2011, the estimated cost was \u00a376m with \u00a361m coming from Northern Ireland's power-sharing government at Stormont and \u00a315m from the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), which owns the ground.\nHowever it is now suggested the stadium could cost more than \u00a3300m.\n\"The question is, where is the rest of the very considerably increased amount of money that will be required?\" said Mr Benn.\n\"I can\u2019t give a blank cheque and you wouldn\u2019t expect me to given the huge rise in the costs there have been and we don\u2019t yet know what the full sum is.\"\nHe added there is a responsibility on the UK government to make a contribution but that he would commit to sitting down with all parties to see whether they could \"contribute more\".\nMr Benn was involved in cross-party talks aimed at restoring the Stormont institutions when he was shadow secretary of state. \nHe welcomed the deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) brought about the return to devolution in Northern Ireland in February.\nAsked for his views on potential reform of the power-sharing rules to prevent future collapses of the institutions, Mr Benn insisted the responsibility for stability lay with locally-elected politicians.\n\u201cWhen we stand for office, our constituents expect us to go to work and do our job, not to say \u2018well, actually there\u2019s a reason why we don\u2019t want to participate in the institutions\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI just have this feeling that after all of the ups and downs and the start and stop there has been, this is a particular moment, it seems to me, for the future of Northern Ireland, and that the people who can ensure that the institutions endure are the politicians who are working in this place.\n\u201cI really hope that that is going to be the case, because it\u2019s the best thing for the people of Northern Ireland, for its economic future and for the functioning of a power-sharing democracy here.\u201d\nThe Windsor Framework is the post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, which is still opposed by some unionists.\nLabour say they are committed to implementing it in good faith while they also want to reshape aspects of the broader EU-UK deal.\nSpeaking to BBC",

    "A graduate has described as \u201cstaggering\u201d the fact that student loan debt owed in Northern Ireland has topped \u00a35bn for the first time.\nRoss Easton, who personally owes about \u00a327,000, said it was an \"an absolutely staggering number\".\nLast year 130,000 people in Northern Ireland were in the repayment system.\nOn average each student who began repayment of their loan in 2024 owed about \u00a325,700.\nThat is according to figures from the Student Loans Company (SLC), which manages loans in the UK.\nLoans are given for tuition fees and maintenance, and interest - capped at 6.23% in Northern Ireland - is charged on the loans.\nMr Easton said his monthly repayments were only servicing the interest on the loan.\n\"Although the money's getting taken from my account every month, it has not even actually taken away from the total value that is owed,\" he said.\n\"I mean it's a shame and it's shocking that you can see this money coming away every month, but nothing actually happens.\"\nBut he said when it comes to monthly repayments, they are \u201cjust something you become used to\u201d.\n\"It's not essentially money that you miss because you're not used to having it,\u201d he said.\n\"To have that extra cash every month would be good, but it's not in my case enough to break the bank.\n\"I think it's just one of those things that you see coming out and you just have to take it on the chin.\"\nMost students from Northern Ireland in higher education get a loan for their tuition fees and a maintenance loan for living costs.\nCaoimhe McKiernan, a recent graduate from Ulster University, has begun to repay her loans.\nShe told BBC News NI that repayment had come as a shock at first, as \"I didn\u2019t get told that it would be coming out of my pay cheque when it did.\"\n\"Most of my university degree was online due to Covid,\" she said.\n\"I am paying these fees and did not get the full university experience.\"\nZoey Robinson, 27, from Lurgan went to Queen's University Belfast for her undergraduate in Psychology and the University of Stirling for an MSc in Health Psychology.\n\"I try to avoid checking my payslip to see the deductions taken each month because that\u2019s heart-breaking\", she said.\nZoey's loan covered her undergraduate degree, but only 70% of her postgraduate course.\n\"It was really hard considering I was also moving country for it,\" she said.\n\"I know without the help of my mum and dad, and also being fortunate to have a stable job during uni, I would have also really struggled.\n\"People deserve a right to education without being put into debt, maxing out their overdrafts, working crazy hours,\" Ms Robinson added.\nThe maintenance loan for living costs is to help pay for things like accommodation, food, travel, books and equipment.\nIt is means tested, so the amount a student get depends on their family's household income.\nMaximum loans range from \u00a35,250 a year if a student lives at home to almost \u00a39,500 if they are studying in London.\nThe tuition fee loan pays for university fees, which are lower if a Northern Irish student stays in Northern Ireland to study than if they take a course elsewhere in the UK.\nUndergraduate students from Northern Ireland currently pay \u00a34,710 a year in tuition fees if they remain in Northern Ireland to study.\nHowever, they pay up to \u00a39,250 a year if they go to university in the rest of the UK.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, undergraduates from Northern Ireland pay a student contribution fee which is normally around \u20ac3,000 a year.\nSome students from low-income families in Northern Ireland can also get a grant of up to \u00a33,475 a year towards their living costs which does not have to be paid back.\nUndergraduates from Northern Ireland begin to pay back their loans for tuition fees and living costs after they have graduated and are earning a wage of around \u00a325,000 a year.\nRepayment is made through the tax system so often comes automatically from wages.\nLoans and repayment arrangements for postgraduate students are slightly different.\nAccording to the latest figures from the SLC, the total loans owed by students from Northern Ireland reached \u00a35.1bn in 2023-24.\nThat amount has more than doubled over the past decade.\nStudents who became eligible to repay their loans on 2023-24 owed an average of \u00a325,730.\nMany students from Northern Ireland who went to university in England, Scotland and Wales are likely to owe more than the average given the higher tuition fees they pay in those countries.\nAccording to the SLC, just under a quarter of Northern Irish students who have taken out loans have fully paid them off.",

    "Mums have lifted the lid on their experiences of giving birth in Suffolk after hundreds of complaints about maternity services were lodged against the county's hospitals.\nData retrieved by the BBC has revealed that 481 complaints have been made to West Suffolk Hospital and Ipswich Hospital since 2019.\nThe results of the Freedom of Information request show 99 of the complaints made to Ipswich Hospital cited poor communication, while 55 took issue with the level of patient care.\nWest Suffolk Hospital said it was unable to provide information on the specific nature of the complaints it had received.\nThe publication of the figures comes three years after West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds, was told to make improvements after inspectors raised concerns over patient safety.\nIpswich Hospital was also previously found to have put the lives of mums and their babies at risk after a Care Quality Commission review.\nMartina Darling, 37, from Stowmarket, who has given birth at West Suffolk Hospital on two occasions, said she had two \u201ccompletely\u201d different experiences.\n\u201cThe first one was horrendous, especially when looking at customer care and patient care,\" she said. \n\"I felt very out of control and I was made to feel like I couldn\u2019t do it, whereas [my latest birth] was completely different and I felt very empowered and there was so much support and customer care.\n\u201cDuring birth you are very hormonal and emotional and you want everything to go perfectly, but nine times out of 10 it doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cSo I can see why people complain, but I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere else to have a baby - we love it at West Suffolk.\u201d\nEmily Harris, 36, from Ipswich, gave birth to her daughter at Ipswich Hospital two years ago, and is now just weeks away from welcoming her second baby.\nShe said her time in the maternity ward was \u201cpositive\u201d but she was left unhappy with how her husband was treated, although she decided against making a complaint.\n\n\u201cThe main downside was some Covid restrictions were still in place so, when I went into maternity triage, my husband was not allowed to go with me.\n\u201cIn the throes of labour that was unsettling and they didn\u2019t let him know what was happening - he just had to wait out in the stairwell.\n\u201cThat was about an hour and a half of us not being together and me not having my partner as my support.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think it was serious enough to formalise it. After a couple of weeks of having a baby, your memory starts to fade and it doesn\u2019t seem important any more.\u201d\nIn March the government said it would invest \u00a335 million into funding specialist training for staff and additional midwives to improve services across the country.\nRebecca Wiggans, 44, who runs The Mum Club South Suffolk and gave birth to one of her two children at West Suffolk Hospital, believes more resources are needed.\n\u201cWhen I went in on the day I gave birth they did say they were understaffed but they were still doing their very best,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was missing out because they are so underfunded.

    "Four migrants have died after a boat capsized during an attempt to cross the English Channel, according to the French coastguard.\nOvernight, a navy patrol boat reported that migrants had fallen into the sea off the coast of Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France.\nFour people found \"unconscious\" could not be saved, police added, while 63 were rescued.\nUK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the incident as \"truly awful\". \nThe coastguard said several people fell into the sea after part of their boat \"deflated\".\nThe initial alert was raised at 04:30 local time (03:30 BST), with a helicopter arriving about 30 minutes later. It found several people \"drifting in the water while others were still clinging to the broken rubber dingy\".\nFourteen people were rescued by a fishing vessel and 49 others by the French navy ship, the coastguard said.\n\"All the shipwrecked individuals were then brought ashore in Boulogne and taken care of by the emergency services on land.\"\nTwo boats, one from UK sea rescue charity RNLI and one from Border Force, were initially sent from Dover to provide support but were not required to attend the scene, the UK coastguard said. \nJacques Billant, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region, told reporters nine people were in serious condition.\nHe said only one person on board was wearing a life jacket, while \"a few others had bike tubes\".\n\"Week after week, we observe overloaded boats like this morning's, boats of very poor quality: under inflated, without a floor, without life jackets,\" he said.\n\"These are also underpowered boats, which obviously increase the risks of breakdown and sinking.\"\nUK Home Office figures show 484 migrants crossed the English Channel on Monday and Tuesday.\nOn 18 June, 882 people crossed the Channel on 15 small boats \u2013 a new record for the year so far.\nAccording to Home Office data, those arrivals were the highest in a single day since October 2022.\nOver 13,000 people have successfully reached the UK via the Channel so far this year.\nAccording to the UN-affiliated International Organization for Migration (IOM) the most recent deaths mean more than 20 people are known to have died while trying to cross the Channel this year.\nThis includes a seven-year-old girl who died in March after a small boat attempting to reach the English Channel capsized a few kilometres from the coast of Dunkirk.\nA month later five people, including another seven-year-old girl, died while a boat carrying 112 migrants ran aground on a sandbank after leaving Wimereux, near Boulogne, before continuing on.\nReacting to the latest deaths, Mrs Cooper, the UK home secretary, said: \"Criminal gangs are making vast profit from putting lives at risk. \n\"We are accelerating action with international partners to pursue and bring down dangerous smuggler gangs.\"\nEarlier this week, the new Labour government set out plans to tackle the small boat crisis.\nMs Cooper said she would appoint a leader of the UK's new Border Security Command within weeks.\nThe government hopes the new body will reduce small boat crossings in the English Channel.\nMr Billant, the Pas-de-Calais prefect, said over 1,000 police officers were currently deployed along the entire French northern coastline, \"amid heightened aggression from smugglers and migrants alike\".\nHe said 344 crossing attempts had been foiled so far this year.\nThe previous Tory government had a flagship policy of countering illegal migration by sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda. But the controversial scheme was axed in the early days of the new Labour government without a single migrant ever having been deported to the east African country.\nBut despite recent elections in both countries there has been no change of policy in France since Rishi Sunak and Emmanuel Macron signed a cooperation agreement in March last year.\nIt was the latest of many such deals under in which the UK supplies money and the French step up their policing of the coast, using more manpower and better equipment.\nFrance will be keen to see how the Labour government might change things. \nThe scrapping of the Rwanda scheme came as no surprise, because the French never thought it was either right or effective. \nThe scheme had shown no clear sign of having a deterrent effect. Numbers kept going up.\nThe French view remains that the UK should address the pull factors that keep drawing so many migrants, such as the ease of entering the jobs market undetected and the lack of identity cards.  \nGovernments of all stripes in Paris know the Calais problem is perennial, and the most to be hoped for is more effective operational cooperation with London.",

    "France's former first lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, has been charged over an election funding scandal dating back to 2007 involving cash from the then Libyan dictator, Col Muammar Gaddafi.\nAccording to French media, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, 56, was charged with hiding evidence and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud.\nShe was placed under judicial control and barred from being in contact with all those accused except her husband, Nicolas Sarkozy. \nMs Bruni-Sarkozy is also suspected of concealment of witness tampering and involvement in an attempt to bribe Lebanese judicial personnel, among other violations.\nHer lawyers told AFP that Ms Bruni-Sarkozy was determined to assert her rights and challenge the \"unfounded decision\".\nMr Sarkozy, who was the president of France from 2007 to 2012, is due to go on trial next year over allegations he took money from Gaddafi to finance his successful election bid.\nHe is accused of corruption, illegal campaign financing, benefiting from embezzled public funds and membership in a criminal conspiracy. He has always denied all the charges.\nThe investigation into the allegations was opened in 2013, two years after Saif al-Islam, son of the then leader Gaddafi, first accused Mr Sarkozy of taking millions of his father's money for campaign funding.\nThe following year, Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, who for a long time acted as a middleman between France and the Middle East, supported the claims.\nHe told judges he had written proof that Mr Sarkozy's campaign bid was \"abundantly\" financed by Tripoli, and that the \u20ac50m (\u00a343m) worth of payments continued after he became president.\nYears later, Mr Takieddine told French media that in 2006-07 he had personally handed over suitcases stuffed with banknotes to Mr Sarkozy and his chief of staff, Claude Gu\u00e9ant, who later denied this.\nBut in 2020, Mr Takieddine suddenly retracted his statement about handing over large amounts of money.\nThis raised suspicions that Mr Sarkozy and his allies - including his wife - might have paid him to change his mind.\nIn June, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy was found to have deleted messages exchanged with a French businesswoman who was questioned by police over accusations of witness tampering.\nSince losing his re-election bid to socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2012, Mr Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations.\nIn 2023, he was given a suspended prison sentence for trying to bribe a judge, and earlier this year, he was found guilty of illegally funding his 2012 re-election campaign.\nHe and Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, an Italian-born former supermodel and singer, married in 2008. They had a daughter, Giulia, in 2011.",
    "A dairy farming family at the forefront of new methods of agriculture believe it is vital to help people understand the benefits for reducing climate change.\nRobert and Lucy Noad are the fourth generation to have worked Woodhouse Farm in Semington, Wiltshire, and are passionate about the regenerative methods they use to produce their milk.\n\"We're positive about making a noise about it, you need people to stick their necks above the parapet and say, 'Ok, I'll have a go,'\" said Mrs Noad.  \nThe farm is hosting a family fun day on 13 July to encourage people to visit the farm, meet the cows, and purchase milk from a new vending station.\nRegenerative agriculture is a holistic approach to farming with a strong focus on improving soil health and biodiversity.\nIt aims to minimise disturbance to the natural, ecological processes. \n\"We've got over 15 varieties of grasses, legumes and things like clovers and different native herbs in the paddocks,\" said Mrs Noad.\n\"The cattle go in to graze each field for just one day, so they're in and out really quickly and can't selectively graze out the species they like.\n\"So we have a really diverse species of plants.\"\nThe Noads are part of First Milk, a British farmer-owned dairy co-operative. \nLast year, the family owned up to feeling \"exhausted\" and overwhelmed by the expectations of the industry to be \"bigger and higher yielding all the time\".\nAs part of the co-operative they are now paid not just for the number of litres of milk they produce, but also for the other things the farm is achieving, making their business not only financially viable, but ethical as well.\n\"First Milk are way ahead of anybody else who's buying milk in this country; how they've structured our milk contract and the amount of support they provide in the journey we're making,\" said Mrs Noad.\nMrs Noad, said there are only a \"handful\" of farmers in the south west practice these methods but at a recent festival of regenerative agriculture there was considerable interest from other farmers wanting to learn about it.\nThe free family fun day on 13 July is a chance for people to visit Woodhouse Farm, meet the cows and find out more about the farming methods.\nThe Noads also hope in future to open up the farm regularly to visitors and schoolchildren.\n\"I can't expect people to support us if they don't understand what we're doing,\" added Mrs Noad.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram..

This Pride belongs to the town, I just helped it happen.\"\nA special concert featured Vicki Vivacious from RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, ska band The Beat and headliner Janice Robinson, known for her hit song I'm A Dreamer.\nThe former singer of 90s group Livin' Joy said headlining the event felt \"amazing\". \nShe said: \"To actually receive the title of headliner is an achievement in my career that I\u2019m always proud to have.\n\"Being an ally for the past 30-plus years in this community means the world to me, so, when they call me and it\u2019s their first Pride, I have to show up. \n\"It\u2019s a real honour for me.\"\nThe event aims to celebrate Dorset's diverse community \"in full colour, with a message of love, acceptance and inclusivity\".\nThe parade saw Cheap Street lined with cheering onlookers in rainbow colours, while pop-up performances took place around town by the likes of Sherborne Bounce, Merriott Majorettes and Sherborne Rock Choir.\nMs Wilkins said: \"Doing this has meant that the people in society who feel like they are different and not accepted for whatever reason, the people who are scared to be their authentic selves, can see themselves in others and feel accepted and like they belong. \n\"Visibility is everything.\"\nLux Angelsong, who travelled from Crewkerne in Somerset, described the day as \"pretty incredible\". \nLux added: \"It\u2019s such a big step forward for a smaller town, an amazing thing to accomplish...

    "On the face of it, this past week\u2019s Nato summit in Washington has ticked the boxes. The alliance can show it is bigger and stronger than ever, its military support for Ukraine appears undiminished and it has just sent a robust message to China to stop secretly supporting Russia\u2019s war on Kyiv.\nSir Keir Starmer\u2019s new government has had a chance to position itself as a linchpin in the transatlantic alliance at a time when political uncertainty hovers over the White House and much of Europe.\nBack home in Britain, the priorities for this new government are pressing: the economy, housing, immigration, the NHS, to name but a few. \nYet unwanted threats and scenarios can often have a habit of turning up and upsetting the best laid plans.\nSo what could be coming down the track during the life of this new UK government?\n\nNo surprises here, this one is on everybody\u2019s radar. But that does not make it any less dangerous, for Lebanon, Israel and the entire Middle East.\n\"The possibility of a large-scale Israeli invasion of Lebanon this summer should be at the top of the new government\u2019s geopolitical risk register.\" \nThat\u2019s according to Professor Malcolm Chalmers, the Deputy Director-General of the Whitehall think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). \nWith the conflict continuing in Gaza and the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping continuing, Prof Chalmers believes \"we could be entering a period of sustained multi-front warfare in the region, for which neither Israel nor its Western partners will be prepared.\"\nEver since the Hamas-led raid into southern Israel on 7 October last year, there have been fears that Israel\u2019s subsequent military campaign in Gaza could escalate across borders into a full-scale regional war.\nIsrael\u2019s troubled northern border with Lebanon is where such a war is most at risk of igniting. \nThe daily exchange of fire across this border, between the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shia militia, have already resulted in hundreds killed, mostly in Lebanon. \nMore than 60,000 Israelis have been forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods in the north and an even greater number of people on the Lebanese side. \nDomestic pressure is mounting for the Israeli government to \"deal with\" Hezbollah by pushing its forces north of Lebanon\u2019s Litani River, from where they would have less chance of sending rockets into Israel.\n\"We don\u2019t want to go to war,\" says Lt Col Nadav Shoshani of the IDF, \"but I don\u2019t think any country could accept 60,000 of its citizens displaced. The situation has to end. We would like it to be a diplomatic solution, but Israeli patience is wearing thin.\"\n\nThere are strong reasons for both sides not to go to war.\nLebanon\u2019s economy is already fragile. It has barely recovered from the 2006 war with Israel and a renewed full-scale conflict would have a devastating impact on the country\u2019s infrastructure and its people.\nHezbollah, for its part, would likely respond to a major Israeli attack and invasion with a massive and sustained missile, drone and rocket barrage that could potentially overwhelm Israel\u2019s Iron Dome air defences. \nNowhere in Israel is beyond its reach.\nAt this point, the US Navy, positioned offshore, could well join in on Israel\u2019s side. Which then begs the question of what Iran would do. \nIt too has a sizeable arsenal of ballistic missiles as well as a network of proxy militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria that could be mobilised to intensify their attacks on Israel.\nOne way to take the heat out of the tension on the Israel-Lebanon border would be for the conflict in Gaza to come to an end. But after nine months and a horrific death toll, a lasting peace has yet to be achieved.\nThe Iran nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), designed to contain and monitor Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, was the crowning foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration in 2015. \nBut it has long since fallen apart. \nOne year after President Trump unilaterally withdrew from it, Iran stopped abiding by its rules. \nBuried deep beneath gigantic mountains, ostensibly beyond the reach of even the most powerful of bunker-busting bombs, Iran\u2019s nuclear centrifuges have been spinning frantically, enriching uranium to well beyond the 20% needed for peaceful civil purposes. (A nuclear bomb requires highly enriched uranium.)\nOfficially, Iran insists its nuclear programme remains entirely peaceful, that it is purely for generating energy. \nBut Israeli and Western experts have voiced fears that Iran has a clandestine programme to reach what is known as \"breakout capability\": achieving a position where it has the capacity to build a nuclear bomb, but does not necessarily do so.\nIt will not have escaped Iran\u2019s notice that North Korea, an isolated, global pariah, has been steadily amassing an arsenal of nuclear warheads and the means to deliver them, constituting a major deterrent to any would-be attacker.\nIf Iran gets the Bomb, then it is almost inevitable t",

    "England have done it again - they've made it to a Euros final. Facing Spain on Sunday, the team hopes to bring football home and become men's European champions for the first time.\nFollowing England is always a journey - here are some of the unique ways fans have been marking the occasion.\nOne England superfan who will be there in Berlin is 56-year-old Ian Odgers from  Dereham, Norfolk. He marks his away trips with a tattoo of every passport stamp he  gets when England play overseas.\nMr Odgers' passion for England was ignited when he attended his first game at the age of 12 - and he made it his life's ambition to follow the side.\nHe thinks he's travelled to more than 20 countries as a supporter at about 60 matches overseas - and started documenting his football trips with a series of tattoos about five years ago.\nThe production planner's dedication to supporting England has propelled him into the FA's highest tier of fans, a group known as the \"top cappers\", who can mostly get guaranteed tickets.\n\"We describe ourselves as the 'same old faces, different places',\" Mr Odgers said.\n\"Coming from different parts of the country, taking different routes across Europe to ultimately do the one thing we love - which is supporting the country.\"\nSome England fans were lucky enough to meet Gareth Southgate in person ahead of the Netherlands v England semi-final - or so you might think from the viral footage filmed by one supporter.\nTourists in Dortmund spotted a police officer who bore a strong resemblance to the Three Lions' coach.\nSinging the fan-favourite adaptation of Atomic Kitten's Whole Again, supporters surrounded the bemused but humoured cop to tell him football was \"coming home again\".\nThe video, filmed by Rob Toone from Derby, was shared widely on social media, including by the German Embassy in London.\nOldham Council leader Arooj Shah sparked outrage by calling for a vote to end a council meeting early so councillors could \"watch the Euros\" - something councillors debated until just before kick-off.\nThe Labour Cabinet Member said while she \"wasn't a big fan of the game\" herself, she thought it was \"important to celebrate big national moments\".\nThe meeting began at 18:00 BST on Wednesday and was due to run until 21:00 - kick-off for England's semi-final against the Dutch was at 20:00.\nBut Liberal Democrat councillor Howard Sykes opposed the suggestion, saying: \"I think the public will be absolutely furious that Labour suggested this.\"\nUltimately his suggestion to reject the early end time was outvoted, and the meeting ended at 20:00 BST - just as the whistle blew.\nCouncillors then rapidly exited the chambers, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nAfter England secured their spot in the final, Gareth Southgate Street in Gloucester returned after a three-year hiatus. \nA homemade, laminated \"Gareth\" was first placed on top of the sign for Southgate Street in 2018 for the World Cup, and proved a big hit. \nRich Leigh and friend Tom Gibbon decided to put the sign up again after watching Ollie Watkins score a late winner against the Netherlands on Wednesday.\nRich said it was \u201clovely to see\u201d everyone enjoying the sign, which is a homage to the England manager.\n\u201cIt all started in 2018 when Tom photoshopped something about Gareth Southgate Street and put it on Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m an idiot I thought I\u2019ll get this printed for the World Cup, I cycled past and put it up.\u201d\nThe pair put the sign up near Southgate House ahead of England\u2019s Euros match against Denmark in 2021, with the addition of a second one on the street\u2019s corner with Spa Road.\nImages of India and Pakistan cricket fans uniting to cheer on England's football team could only have been captured in the West Midlands, the man who caught the moment said.\nHarjap Bhangal\u2019s clip showed how rival fans at Edgbaston's cricket ground gathered together around TVs last Saturday to cheer on England's Euro 2024 quarter-final win.\nThe historic rivalry at India-Pakistan matches is usually \u201cvery fierce, very bitter,\u201d but suddenly \u201cwe were all united, just glued to the screen\", Mr Bhangal said.\nThe clip has racked up more than nine million views on X and has been shared by high profile figures such as Gary Lineker, Hugh Grant and Adil Ray.\nThe cricket fans were at Edgbaston to watch India and Pakistan play in the World Championship of Legends, a contest for retired and non-contracted players.\nMr Bhangal said people soon started watching England\u2019s Euros match on their phones, before persuading bars inside the stadium to switch their TVs to the football.\n\u201cThe crowds just got bigger and bigger, until the whole concourse was absolutely flooded,\u201d he told BBC Radio WM, adding that he had travelled from London for the cricket and still abandoned his front-row seat to watch the football.\nThousands of fans with tickets to see The Killers at London's O2 arena on Wednesday night thought they would have to miss England's semi-final - but the band had a solution.\nThey deligh",

    "Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister has refused to rule out joining Reform UK on the benches in the House of Commons.\nTUV and Reform UK announced an electoral partnership in March ahead of the general election.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI on the first day of the new Parliament, Mr Allister said there was no reason he wouldn't sit beside Nigel Farage, after appearing beside the Reform UK leader earlier on Tuesday afternoon.\n\"I've known [Nigel Farage] for many years in the European parliament and fought many battles together,\" the new MP for North Antrim added.\nWhen asked if he would be taking the Reform UK party whip, he said there were still \"a number of practical issues to be resolved\", adding, \"we will see in due course\".\nWith the celebrations over, the work begins for Northern Ireland's new MPs.\nOut of 650 people elected on Thursday, 335 have never been an MP before.\nThe new Parliament sees a series of firsts - record numbers of women MPs and those from an ethnic-minority background, as well as the first member born in the 21st century.\nThe seven new additions to Northern Ireland's parliamentary line-up are Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, Sinn F\u00e9in's Pat Cullen, D\u00e1ire Hughes and Cathal Mallaghan, independent unionist Alex Easton, the Alliance Party's Sorcha Eastwood and Ulster Unionist Robin Swann.\nFormer Stormont Health Minister, Mr Swann tweeted that he had arrived on Monday evening and took a \"first day at school photo\".\nOn his first day on the job, Mr Swann said it was a \"humbling experience\" to bring the Ulster Unionist Party back to the House of Commons.\nMr Swann said he was more than a \"one-man band\" and would be given company by his former party leader Lord Elliott, who has just taken up a seat in the House of Lords.\n\"People had our party written off for years because we had no representation in the commons, now we\u2019re back,\" he added.\n\"I\u2019m here to represent all the people of South Antrim who actually voted for me and those who didn\u2019t vote for me as well.\"\n\"This is major league hurling now compared to where we were before in regards to the assembly,\" he said.\nSpeaking in parliament, Mr Allister said he came on behalf of constituents who wanted Northern Ireland's place in the union restored.\n\"We must end the partitioning of our kingdom by a foreign border and we must end a situation where 300 areas of law are not controlled by this house, not controlled by Stormont, but controlled by a foreign parliament,\" he added.\nWhen called on by Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Mr Allister joked that with him on his \"best behaviour and you at your tolerant best I trust we will have a mutually cordial relationship\".\nThe TUV has been strongly critical of the DUP's deal with the previous government, which saw the party end its two-year boycott of Northern Ireland's devolved government in February.\nSpeaking before he boarded a flight to London, Mr Easton said he was relishing the prospect of going to \"one of the biggest stages in the world\".\n\"I've wanted to achieve this for a lifetime, and I keep pinching myself, it's hard to sink in,\" he said.\n\"It's a big thing, I've achieved the one thing in my life I really wanted to do, it's a huge change for me.\n\"It's the ultimate democracy, I want to use that and make a difference.\" \nMr Easton took the North Down constituency from Alliance, unseating the party's deputy leader, Stephen Farry. \nLagan Valley's first female MP Sorcha Eastwood told the Commons her presence demonstrated \"a changing, more shared and integrated Northern Ireland\" as she addressed the chamber for the first time.\nReferencing the prime minister's commitment to public service, Ms Eastwood said all representatives owed \"a debt of gratitude to our constituents\".\n\"I will never forget the constituents of Lagan Valley and I join with everyone in the whole house in looking forward to committing to public service for all,\" she said.\nProceedings in the House of Commons chamber started at 14:30 BST when Sir Lindsay was re-elected as Speaker.\nAfter the election and affirmation of the Speaker, members began to swear in.\nThis will continue into Wednesday.\nEvery MP must take an oath of allegiance to the King at the beginning of a new Parliament. \nIf they do not, then they cannot sit or vote in the House of Commons.\nMPs representing Sinn F\u00e9in refuse to swear the oath or make the affirmation to the King. \nThe party believes the interests of the Irish people can only be served by democratic institutions in Ireland, not at Westminster.\nAs a result, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs do not take their seats in the House of Commons. \nThis long-standing policy is known as abstentionism. \nSinn F\u00e9in adds its MPs are elected on an abstentionist mandate and by not taking their seats they are fulfilling the wishes of the electorate.",

He was brought on alongside Cole Palmer, who set up his goal.\nWatkins turned Stefan de Vrij and slotted the ball into the bottom corner for one of the most important England goals ever scored.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Humberside, Hargreaves said: \"I know what it will have meant to him and his family, but he's so grounded, just as he was back then.\"\nHargreaves, who made over 650 appearances for several clubs over his playing career, said: \"I've been in the game a long time and it still matters.\n\"Seeing him [Watkins] on the international stage scoring the winning goal was very special.\"\nHe said he had only played a small part in Watkins' development and the player's success was down to hard work.\nEven in the early days, Hargreaves said Watkins had \"stood out\".\n\"What he represents now was the same back then - that love of the game - the smile on his face and the constant running and pressing,\" added Hargreaves.\nHe said he had watched the game, which ended 2-1, in a hotel bar in Exeter, which made it even more special with the fans singing Watkins' name.\nWatkins started his career lower in the football pyramid - at Exeter.\nReminiscing about coaching Watkins in the early days, Hargreaves said: \"We were training on sandy Astro Turf in the freezing cold, and driving all over the country on a Sunday in a mini-bus that could hardly get to the stadiums, with no fuel in it\".\nHe added Watkins and his cohort would mop the changing room floors after the game.\n\"He's definitely done it the hard way, of that there is now doubt,\" he added.\nEngland take on Spain in the final on Sunday.\nFollow BBC East Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Proposed job cuts at a nuclear research centre run by the University of Sheffield  could mean the site will close, an MP has warned.\nThe university has issued redundancy notices for staff amid a shake-up of the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), with about 100 specialist engineering jobs at risk.\nThe university said it had started a 90-day consultation period to look at proposals and explore future options. \nClive Betts, the Labour MP for Sheffield South East, said he was concerned the site itself could go.\nHowever, the university said core manufacturing research and development activities would remain.\nMr Betts said: \u201cThe university needs to urgently reconsider its decision as it not only leads to the loss of 100 highly skilled jobs, it also damages the UK\u2019s research capability in this area.\"\nHe said he would ask Energy Secretary Ed Miliband \"to intervene and assist as much public funding has been spent on the centre\". \n\"Renewables, particularly onshore wind, has been flagged up as a significant contributor to [net zero targets],\" he said.\n\"But we also know nuclear has got to be there as the baseload for any electricity system that is less carbon intensive.\"\nProfessor Koen Lamberts, Vice-Chancellor at the University of Sheffield, said the Nuclear AMRC's structure needed to be changed so priorities around clean energy research and innovation could be delivered.\n\u201cThe plans propose that the Nuclear AMRC\u2019s core manufacturing research and development activities will be retained by the University of Sheffield,\" he said.\n\u201cThe proposed changes reflect the university\u2019s key strength in nuclear manufacturing R&D. \n\"Our work to support the design and production of small module reactors (SMRs) will continue to grow and offer significant opportunities for the South Yorkshire region.\u201d\nThe Nuclear AMRC, founded in 2011, helps UK companies win work in the nuclear sector through research and innovation.\nIts website said it works across \"nuclear new-build, operations, decommissioning and technology development, and in other high-value low-carbon manufacturing industries\".\nThe university said it was working hard to reduce the need for redundancies and was supporting staff through changes.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter), and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Before 15-year-old Isobel Sheppard died from an extremely rare cancer, she left a file on her phone entitled, 'If I Die Young'.\nThe teenager from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma in early 2020 after she suddenly struggled to walk.\nIn the file she detailed she wanted memory jewellery to be given to her friends and a celebration of her life with fireworks to be held on her birthday each year.\nHer mother,  Sam Sheppard, along with two other women in the county, are keen to educate people on this rare cancer during Sarcoma Awareness Month this July.\nAt the end of 2019 when Isobel was 12, she complained her left leg had been feeling numb, but Mrs Sheppard said the family was not too concerned.\nHowever in January 2020 while at school Isobel rang her parents to say she could not walk.\nAfter several hospital scans, an eight by five by 13 centimetre tumour was found in her groin which Mrs Sheppard described as \"completely out of the blue\".\nIsobel had synovial sarcoma - a type of cancer that develops in cells around joints and tendons - which the family had never heard of.\nShe soon after underwent chemotherapy and had her entire left leg amputated.\n\"Isobel was an absolute warrior,\" Mrs Sheppard said.\n\"She did have down days but she coped with it admirably throughout,\" \nWhile the treatment was initially successful for two years, Isobel unfortunately relapsed in October 2022 with several tumours found across her body.\n\"The x-rays they do every three or four months had missed [a tumour] - it was behind her heart,\" Mrs Sheppard said.\n\"They didn't realise it had come back until a very advantaged stage.\"\nShe died on 14 December, 2022 before the family found the file on her mobile phone with her final wishes which they carried out. \n\"Isobel was strong-minded, funny, sassy and she was kind, helpful and caring. She was wonderful,\" added Mrs Sheppard. \nThe mother encouraged anyone with any lumps to get them checked.\nHolly Lewis, 29, from Ipswich, noticed pain in her arm while driving in 2020.\nDoctors soon after diagnosed her with osteosarcoma - a type of bone sarcoma that most affects the knee, thigh or shin bone or upper arm.\nA tumour measuring at around 11cm was found in her armpit and shortly after her initial diagnosis doctors told her it was stage four. \n\"I think it was because of where the tumour was it was obviously pressing on the nerves that run through your shoulder, down to your elbow, wrists and fingers,\" she explained.\n\"I then got the diagnosis - and I remember the date so clearly - I was diagnosed on 7 January, 2021, 9 days before my 26th birthday.\n\"When you get told, you get hit with a wave of shock. You can't even begin to fathom the impact that that has.\"\nMiss Lewis had four surgeries as well as six rounds of chemotherapy and is now fortunately stable despite the fact the cancer will likely never be cured.\nShe added she had never heard of sarcoma before she was diagnosed.\n\"I never thought I'd see the day where I get diagnosed with it,\" she said. \n\"I [think] it is so important to get yourself checked out and not to leave it.\"\nIn 2020 Jack Harper, from Lowestoft, thought he was suffering from heartburn after gaining a small about of weight but it turned out to be angiosarcoma - a sarcoma that develops from the cells lining the blood vessels.\nAccording to Sarcoma UK it accounts for just 0.05% of all cancer diagnoses.\nHis wife, Fiona Harper, explained a tumour the size of a fist was found on his heart and he would need open heart surgery at Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire to remove this. \nWhile the operation was successful and chemotherapy throughout that year saw Jack make improvements, by the end of the summer of 2021 he had declined again.\n\"We never found out how long we had left, we were always hopeful. We never ever thought it's game over for us,\" Mrs Harper said.\n\"We thought this cancer is not beating us - he's 36 and we've got two young children. We are not giving up.\"\nBy January 2022, after a tough fight, Jack was placed on palliative care. \n\"In the April we sadly lost him, he got too poorly,\" Mrs Harper continued. \n\"I remember him saying to me a couple of days before, I can't do this anymore.\n\"He was a gorgeous guy, a beautiful man, so selfless.\"\nMrs Harper with the couple's son Arthur, nine, will walk the length of the South Downs Way in Sussex starting on 20 July to raise awareness and money for Sarcoma UK.\nTheir daughter Agnes, five, will also occasionally join them during the walk\nShe explained raising awareness was important to the family and encouraged anyone with any health concerns to ensure they were checked.\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "A man who said he was abused by a \"sadistic\" prison officer is \"gutted\" he missed the chance to face his attacker in court.\nCraig Noman, now 62, spent six weeks at HMP Eastwood Park where he said he was under the watch of Patrick Devaney, who was jailed last year for subjecting teenage boys to physical, racial and verbal abuse at the juvenile detention centre between 1970 and 1983.\nMr Noman, who was not aware of the court case until last month, told the BBC he was \"devastated\" to have missed his opportunity to \"look Devaney in the eye and ask 'why?'\". \nAfter committing his first offence aged just 15, Mr Noman was sent to Eastwood Park, then a young offenders institute, in 1978 \u2013 an experience he described as \"brutal\" and the catalyst for years of criminal offending.\nDevaney, 81, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison at Bristol Crown Court after being found guilty of misconduct in public office. \nMr Noman, from Cardiff, who now works as a support worker for a charity supporting vulnerable homeless young people across South Wales, described how he had been repeatedly abused by Devaney throughout his time at Eastwood Park. \nHe said his first interaction with the prison officer was on his very first night at the institution. \n\"He told me to run to the end of a corridor with my bed pack, read a sign on the door, and sprint back to him. He was screaming at me 'run, run',\" he said. \n\"I got to the door, ran back, and he asked me 'what was the sign?'.\n\"I said 'no running' - I had a slap across the head, a punch in the stomach, and he told me not to run.\" \nThis arbitrary, violent punishment was typical of what Mr Noman said he and other young people at the institution went through under Devaney's watch. \nAt his trial, 22 former detainees gave evidence about the \"evil\" physical abuse he subjected them to. \nAn athletic teenager, Mr Noman described how he was singled out by Devaney and made captain of the football team. \n\"There were other boys there who weren\u2019t very good at football and I witnessed him abusing them physically, emotionally, verbally,\" Mr Noman said. \nHe described a number of incidents in which he was physically abused by Devaney, including one situation where he said the prison officer asked him to catch rabbits in the prison grounds. \n\"I\u2019ll never forget it, you\u2019re on your hands and knees, there were wild rabbits running everywhere,\" he said. \n\"I caught one on my hands and knees and stood up to give it to him, but the rabbit got out of my hands. He punched me in the stomach a few times, called me a stupid boy and gave me a clip across the head just for dropping a rabbit.\" \nThere were other instances in which Mr Noman said he was hit six times with a cricket bat by Devaney for dropping lime from a wheelbarrow, and another where he said he was punched in the back of the head and left \"seeing stars\" for nodding at another detainee he recognised in the dinner queue. \n\"I knew that if I made a mistake I\u2019d have a punch or a slap or the cricket bat,\" he said. \n\"He was a very sadistic man, he\u2019d get a kick out of inflicting pain or violence on you.\"\nHaving never been in a young offenders institute before, Mr Noman - who was detained in 1978 for wounding with intent - said he came to believe that such abuse was \"normal\". \n\"I thought, \u2018this is how grown-ups behave, when you\u2019re away from home for being a naughty boy',\" he said. \nAt the time, government policy included punishing young offenders with a \"short, sharp shock\" and detention centres would implement a harsh \"military-style\" regime.\nBut the court during Devaney's trial heard his behaviour went far beyond what was \"appropriate or acceptable\".\nInvolved with a gang in Cardiff from a young age, Mr Noman was in and out of prison more than a dozen times throughout the 80s and 90s - receiving his last conviction in 2000. \nWhile he had already been caught up in criminal activity, he said his experience with Devaney at Eastwood Park meant he \"came out more violent than when I went in\". \n\u201cI thought if I can handle six weeks in there with them, especially him, I can do anything. I can go to prison and that\u2019ll be easy,\" he said. \n\"I saw life differently when I came out, I didn\u2019t care.\"\nMr Noman said that even now, more than 40 years after his detention at Eastwood Park, Devaney was still the only prison officer's name he could remember - such was his impact on the rest of his life. \nHe said: \"If I saw him now, even though he\u2019s a pensioner, I\u2019d just like to ask him: \u2018What did you get out of seeing me in pain, of seeing other boys in pain?\u2019 \n\"It was inhuman to act like that. You don\u2019t pick on young boys, physically abuse them and make their lives hell, but you did.\u201d\nAfter his conviction, Det Insp Alan Smith, from Avon and Somerset Constabulary, said Devaney \"exploited his position to physically assault those who he was meant to keep safe\".\n\"The force he used however went way beyond what was appropriate and acceptable, with many of his victims describing him as ",

    "A football fan who has family from the Netherlands says she will be supporting England \"all the way\", but will wear a Holland shirt as \"a backup\".\nEmily Knight, 38, who lives in Grantham, Lincolnshire, said her loyalties would mainly lie with England during the Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands.\nDuring the match, she said she would be the only one wearing a Holland top, as she has a Dutch mother and often visits family in the Netherlands.\nShe lives with her husband Gareth, 45, and their children - Edwyn, six, and Wilfred, five.\nMrs Knight was born and brought up in England and her mother, Gerda Newsham, 69, moved to the UK in 1983 and lives with her stepfather in Essex.\nReferring to the performance from both teams over the course of the tournament as \"pretty lacklustre\", Mrs Knight said she was most looking forward to captains Harry Kane and Virgil van Dijk battling it out for victory on the pitch.\n\"If I had to pick a side, it would probably be England,\" she told the PA Media news agency.\n\"My husband will be watching with his England shirt on.

    "Last year more than 5,000 people in the UK were on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. There is a national shortage of all organs, and the impact on daily life for those needing one can be huge. \nBut kidneys can also be given by live donors. Last year 832 people did just that after months of preparation and assessment. \nBBC North West health correspondent Gill Dummigan followed one operation in Manchester.\nI first meet Lesley Harrison the night before her kidney transplant operation, sitting in a side room at the Royal Manchester Infirmary.\n\"It would be daft not to be nervous, wouldn't it? I'll be glad when it's over,\" she says.\nLesley isn't the one receiving a kidney \u2013 she's giving one to her son-in-law Chris.  \nShe's one of just a few hundred people each year in this country who donate one of their own healthy kidneys to save someone else's life.\nI ask her why she's decided to do it.\n\"Because he needs one, and I have one to spare so...,\u201d says Lesley before welling up and pausing.\n\"They can't be a normal family while he's like this so hopefully when he has my kidney they can get back to having a normal life.\"\nKen, Lesley's husband, is there for moral support.  \nHe also offered to donate his own kidney but was ruled out because of his medication. \nKen says he fully supports her: \"I don't see any problem with it.\"\nChris Watkinson, Lesley's son-in-law, has IGA nephropathy, an autoimmune disease which has destroyed his own kidneys, left him on dialysis and unable to work.  \nHe can barely make it upstairs without needing a rest. \nHe knows a successful transport would transform his life.\n\"To have another portion of time, if it's six years fine, if it's longer, even better. Just to get my life back,\" he says.\nI ask the pair if they've spoken much about the emotional enormity of what's about to happen.\n\u201cI don't think we've dwelt on it,\" says Lesley.\nChris says he is always conscious of the impact on Lesley. \"I always ask you how you are feeling.\"\n\"And I always probably just say I'm fine,\" finishes Lesley.\n\"Yes, you've always been very blas\u00e9,\" says Chris, who then looks serious. \n\"It's a huge thing. I probably don't say it to you enough but thank you.\" \nLesley wells up again and waves him away.\nTo get to this point it has taken months of tests and scans to make sure Lesley and both of her kidneys are healthy.\nThe kidneys need to be equally effective, to ensure that both Lesley and Chris can stay healthy with only one.\nMental preparation is also important.\nLive donors are assigned a transplant co-ordinator whose job is to purely look after that donor's interest. Lesley's is Lisa Mulreid, who says it takes about six months to make sure someone is ready.\n\"I think they need that time... so we can give them the right counselling and education throughout for them to decide this the right thing for them to do.\n\"It's massive and it's not for everybody. Sometimes people feel obligated that a relative might need a transplant but you have to be the right kind of person to undergo it really,\" she says.\nThe most recent annual figures for the UK - up to April 2023 - show 832 people were living kidney donors. The number of people waiting for a kidney transplant is 5,361.\nMost organs come from deceased donors, and there is a shortage of all of them. But kidneys are among the few which can be gifted by someone who is still alive.\nZia Moinuddin is the clinical lead for kidney transplants at Manchester Royal Infirmary, one of the biggest living organ transplant centres in the country. \nHe describes living donations as \"the gold standard\".\n\"The kidneys tend to function immediately which improves not just one-year but also five-year survival rates as well,\" he says.\nDifferent centres use different techniques. Some have the donor and the recipient in operating theatres next door to each other so the kidney can be swapped almost immediately.\nOthers, like Manchester, carry out the operations one by one in the same theatre. The organ has to go in an icebox between operations but this technique allows the same consultant to carry out both removal and replacement surgeries.\nSo the next morning it's Lesley sitting in a surgical gown, waiting to be called to theatre.

    "Victims of domestic abuse in the countryside are still being let down by a \u201cwoeful\u201d number of convictions five years after a report criticised the work of several rural police forces, says its author.\nFormer North Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Julia Mulligan said the latest figures for rural areas obtained by the BBC suggested there had been no \u201csignificant improvement in outcomes for victims and survivors\u201d.\nThe response of seven rural forces was found to be \u201clargely inadequate\u201d in 2019.\nBoth police and prosecutors said they were now working hard to improve the investigation, prosecution and handling of domestic abuse in rural communities.\nIn 2019, the landmark \u201cCaptive and Controlled\u201d report studied police responses to domestic abuse in Derbyshire, Devon and Cornwall, Dorset, Durham, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.\nIt found the forces' handling of domestic abuse in the countryside - where victims are often more isolated and abuse can go on 25% longer than in urban areas as a result - was \"largely inadequate\".\nFive years on and Freedom of Information figures obtained by the BBC show the number of offences reported to the seven forces has gone up by 15% compared with the year of the report.\nBut, while there were more than 107,900 reports of domestic abuse between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, the number of successful convictions is significantly lower than the number of offences reported.\nFigures for the seven forces could only be provided for the nine months up to December 2023 but they show there were just 3,312 successful convictions.\nSuch low conviction numbers compared to the number of reports of domestic abuse reflect the picture across the whole of England and Wales but Julia Mulligan says it is of particular concern in rural areas.\nMrs Mulligan said the BBC\u2019s figures \u201cdo not suggest any significant improvement in outcomes for victims and survivors\u201d in rural areas since her findings in July 2019.\nShe told the BBC: \u201cConviction rates are woeful. This is of concern for all victims, but those suffering in rural communities are on average subject to abuse for longer.\"\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) say they can only prosecute domestic abuse cases that are referred to them by the police. \nIn the nine months up to December 2023, 5,546 domestic abuse suspects had been referred from the seven forces to the CPS; 60% of those cases resulted in successful convictions.\n\u201cWhen a case is referred by officers to us for a charging decision, the data shows most will result in a prosecution and conviction,\" the spokesman said.\n\u201cWe know the overall number of prosecutions is still too low and have been working constructively with police to improve the investigation, prosecution and handling of domestic abuse.\"\nSome of those police forces told the BBC that there were now more options available to stop domestic abuse, including civil court orders, Clare's Law disclosures to tell potential victims about their partner's violent past and local support services.\nBut one abuse survivor told the BBC she feared a lack of police resources and training \u2013 together with the stresses facing farmers today - would see more victims left trapped in often isolated rural communities.\nMother-of-three Kerry McClay, 49, who lives in a village in the Derbyshire Dales, survived months of mental, emotional and physical abuse by her husband, Kevin Wigley.\nThat culminated with him trying to kill her by hitting her in the head with an axe before taking his own life in 2013.\nThe couple had run a farm together but problems including bad weather and bovine TB outbreaks pushed her husband to breaking point.\nShe fears the issues facing farmers today \u2013 from months of bad weather and flooding to high fuel, feed and fertilizer costs \u2013 could see others struggle with their mental health and take it out on their partners and families.\n\u201cMy husband didn\u2019t hit me or verbally abuse me for the majority of our marriage,\u201d she told the BBC. \n\u201cBut because of the stresses that come with farming and the solitude that comes with it, he just had a breakdown and that was the result of it.\n\u201cI do worry that there is a lot of stress on farmers today and in the farming environment that weighs down on a farmer. They start snapping at their partners and it gets worse with the more stress that's on them.\u201d\nThe 2019 report also called on rural police forces to recruit more female police officers to support victims.\nThe representation of women in the rural forces has improved: the BBC found that last year female officers, on average, made up around 38% of officers in those areas, up from 32% in 2019.\nAcross all forces in England and Wales, the figure is 34.7%.\nMrs McClay said she hoped more women would be recruited by rural police forces, both as first response officers and visible \"village bobbies\".\n\u201cThey need more female officers certainly on the first interviews they do with victims. They have to be sensitive,\" she said.\n\u201cI can only go from my own",
    "America\u2019s Sweethearts, which lifts the lid on life in the most famous cheerleading team in the US, has been climbing up the Netflix charts since its release last month.\nThe series follows the gruelling recruitment and coaching process for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders - DCC for short - and how much pressure the members face to be perfect.\nAmong the hopefuls is 24-year-old Ariana McClure - a medical sales rep who moved to Dallas to pursue her dream.\nIt is her second attempt at making the team, having been cut in training camp the previous year. \nDancers have to go through a tough audition process and training camp before they're high-kicking in formation on the football pitch, all without a piece of hair or false eyelash being out of place. It's ruthlessly competitive. \nAs well as learning the demanding acrobatic routines, they are required to stay the same size, so they can continue to fit in to the trademark uniform of tiny shorts, crop top and cowboy boots.\nIt\u2019s not the first show about the cheerleaders, who are nicknamed America\u2019s Sweethearts \u2013 there had already been 16 seasons of a reality show about the team on US network CMT.\nBut Netflix has brought DCC to a new audience. And many viewers have expressed shock at the demands on the cheerleaders, and the comparatively low wages they are paid.\nIn addition to intense training, most of the women have other full-time jobs.\nIn the opening episode, Cowboys boss Charlotte Jones admits the cheerleaders are \"not paid a lot\" \u2013 but says women on the team do not join for the pay, rather to be part of something bigger than themselves.\nAriana thinks pay has slightly improved across the board, but still says the cheerleaders should be compensated better.\n\"I definitely [don\u2019t think we have to earn] anything near what the football players are making,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"But I do think that these organisations have enough money.\n\"We like to say it's a part-time job with a full time schedule. Apart from just the hours of practising, it's also two hours beforehand, getting ready, you have to have your hair and make-up done.\n\"It's also finding time within the day to work out so that you stay in shape, not only physically but to make sure you can get through the routines.\"\nShe adds: \"We would all ultimately do it for free because we love it and it's our passion, but it is at the end of the day a job and they treat it as a job and so I think we should be rewarded for our work a little better - but it's getting there.\"\nThe series also touches on the mental health of the dancers.\nFour-year veteran Victoria Kalina \u2013 who has since left the team \u2013 spoke about struggling with depression and eating disorders while she was on the team.\n\"I applaud Victoria for being so brave to speak about it because it's a vulnerable thing and it's hard to speak about that and we all have the same thoughts,\" Ariana says.\nIn order to cope with the pressure of training, Ariana started journalling and seeing a therapist.\nBut she thinks, in order to help others, sports therapists should be offered to cheerleaders on NFL teams.\n\"My therapist was great, but she's not a dancer, or wasn't an athlete,\" she explains. \"And so having just some tools offered for the girls to talk to would be really beneficial.\"\nA DCC spokesperson told the BBC that all chearleaders, like its football players, have access to \"immediate, independent and confidential support resources\".\n\"Also, just like our Cowboys players, they have access to our dedicated team Mental Health and Wellness Consultant on staff, as needed.\"\nThe women featured in the series have won praise from viewers and TV critics for how they face the exacting expectations.\n\"America\u2019s Sweethearts is a disturbing show on many levels, but the resilience of its women is impressive,\" the Guardian said.\nEmma Beddington wrote that there is \"plenty to horrify\" in the series, including the physical toll on the team members' bodies, the \"abysmal pay\" and \"the objectification\".\nTime's Judy Berman wrote: \"At best, they\u2019re athletes working at the apex of their sport; at worst, they\u2019re casualties of a job market, a form of entertainment, and a society in which misogyny is so deeply ingrained, it\u2019s often enforced by the women it oppresses.\"\nWriting in the New York Times, Jessica Grose said: \"If there's another season of the Netflix show, perhaps a more complete picture of the Cowboys cheerleading experience could force this elite institution to evolve, and it may make more of these talented women reach the conclusion that making the team isn't worth the cost.\"\nFor Ariana, the experience ended when she was cut from training camp on the last day.\nShe says she only found out why she was cut from the team while watching the show \"at the same time as everyone else\".\nIn the emotional chat with director Kelli Finglass and choreographer Judy Trammel, Ari was told she was being dropped because there were only 36 spaces, without much further explanation.\nBut earlier, Jones - the team's e",

    "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to send a team of negotiators to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas.\nUS President Joe Biden welcomed the development, which comes a day after Hamas responded to a Gaza ceasefire plan he outlined in late May. The last indirect talks took place in Cairo earlier that month.\nDetails of Hamas's latest response have not been made public, but a Palestinian official told the BBC that the group was no longer demanding a full ceasefire at the outset of the plan presented by Mr Biden.\nA senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to \"pretty significant adjustments\" to its position.\n\"We've had a breakthrough on a critical impasse,\" the US official said, although he stressed that \"this does not mean this deal is going to be closed in the period of days\". \nPresident Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu held a phone call on Thursday, which focused on the hostages and ceasefire negotiations, the official said. \nOn Wednesday, Hamas's political leadership said it had contacted mediators from Egypt and Qatar about ideas it had been discussing with the aim of reaching an agreement.   \nUp to now Hamas has demanded an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting, until it eliminates Hamas.\nWhen he announced the plan on 31 May, President Biden said it was based on a more detailed Israeli proposal, and that it involved three phases.\nThe first would include a \"full and complete ceasefire\" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\nThe second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a \"permanent end to hostilities\". The third phase the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains.\nAfter the two leaders' phone call on Thursday, the Israeli government said in a statement: \"Prime Minister Netanyahu updated President Biden on his decision to send a delegation to continue the hostage negotiations and reiterated the principles that Israel is committed to, especially its commitment to end the war only after all of its goals have been achieved.\"\nMr Netanyahu has declared his objectives to be the return of all remaining hostages, the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, and ensuring Gaza no longer constitutes a threat to Israel. \nThe White House said Mr Biden \"welcomed the prime minister's decision to authorise his negotiators to engage with US, Qatari, and Egyptian mediators in an effort to close out the deal\".\nA source in the Israeli negotiating team meanwhile told Reuters news agency that Hamas's response included \"a very significant breakthrough\" and that there was \"a deal with a real chance of implementation\".\nA senior Palestinian official told the BBC earlier on Thursday that Hamas had given up the demand for a complete ceasefire. Its new conditions, the official said, related to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from a strip of land running along Gaza's southern border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi corridor, and from the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt.\nThe source, who was informed of the response Hamas submitted to the mediators, added that the atmosphere was positive. \"We are going to a new round of negotiations soon,\u201d the source said.\nThe US has accused Hamas of blocking progress towards a ceasefire. \nOn Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the group was the \u201cone exception\u201d to international support for the ceasefire proposal. Hamas, he said, had created \"gaps... in not saying yes to a proposal that everyone, including the Israelis, had said yes to\u201d. \nPrime Minister Netanyahu has said he is \u201ccommitted to the Israeli proposal welcomed by President Biden\u201d, although he has not publicly endorsed the outline as it was laid out.\nThe war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.\nAt least 38,010 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. \nHamas and allied armed groups are believed to still be holding 116 hostages who were taken on 7 October. At least 42 are presumed by Israeli authorities to be dead.\nThe others have been released, rescued or their bodies recovered.\nFour other Israelis have been held hostage since 2014 and 2015, two of whom are presumed dead.\nAdditional reporting by Rushdi Aboualouf in Istanbul",
    "A woman who set up a perimenopause support group after her own struggle to get a diagnosis has seen membership rise to 100,000.\nEmily Barclay set up Perimenopause Hub Facebook page after it took her almost four years to understand her irregular periods, crushing fatigue and mood swings were all to do with being perimenopausal.\nAfter her diagnosis, Ms Barclay, from Earsham in Norfolk, went online to see if she could find advice from others.\nShe said: \"I just could barely find anything. I found one or two things but they didn't fit what I needed, so I set it up.\"\nAccording to the NHS website, the menopause is when your periods stop due to lower hormone levels. It can cause symptoms like anxiety, mood swings, brain fog, hot flushes and irregular periods.\nPerimenopause is when you have symptoms of menopause but your periods have not stopped.\nFor most women in the UK, the average age of reaching the menopause is 51, but decreasing levels of oestrogen can cause perimenopausal symptoms much earlier.\nThe group's success has surprised her. \"I expected at most to help maybe 2,000 people,\" she said.\n\"Now we've got over 100,000 and it's just amazing.\"\nShe put the rising numbers to \"an amazing team of moderators who make sure that it is always a safe and kind place for people\".\nMs Barclay said the aim was to ensure women do not feel alone, especially in perimenopause when hormonal changes begin in a woman's body. \nDespite a welcome growth in discussions about the menopause in the media, and more celebrities like Davina McCall making programmes about this issue, Ms Barclay said more education was required.\nThe personal trainer said: \"It still isn't commonplace to understand what's going on. \n\"You know, if you compare it to puberty, which would be the easiest comparison, every single person knows that when a child hits 10 or 11, stuff's going to start changing.\n\"But at the other end of the scale, we don't.\"\nMs Barclay said hormonal changes were more than your periods ending and maybe a few hot flushes.\n\"That's certainly what I always thought it was, and unfortunately, that lack of education stretches to the medical community as well,\" she added.\n\"Our parents, our mothers, didn't talk about it because there was still that taboo.\n\"You heard of women being sent off to asylums and sanatoriums and things.\n\"So we've come a long way forwards. But we're by no means there.\"\nShe has called for hormonal checks to be carried out for women at about the age of 35, in the same way women are encouraged to get an overall health check-up at 45.  \nMs Barclay said informing women about what might take place in their bodies would also save on NHS resources.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "President Joe Biden sought to revive his beleaguered re-election effort on Sunday, as members of his party debated the future of his candidacy.\nThe president's halting debate performance last week raised serious questions about his physical and mental capacity to run. A prime time interview with ABC on Friday fuelled further speculation about his campaign's future. \nAmid the uncertainty, Mr Biden appeared at two campaign events in Pennsylvania, a key swing state, on Sunday.\nBut those efforts have not stopped the president's fellow Democrats from weighing the risks and rewards of keeping Mr Biden, 81, at the top of the ticket. On Sunday afternoon, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries convened a meeting with ranking Democratic lawmakers that reportedly included discussion of Mr Biden's candidacy.\nFour of those on the call said they thought Biden should drop out, according to CBS, the BBC's US news partner. Sources said at least three others expressed concern about his chances in November.\nA number of top Democratic figures also voiced their stances in televised interviews over the weekend, aiming to address the question: is it riskier to stick with Mr Biden or to leave him behind?\nSome say the party could be headed to defeat against Donald Trump in November if Mr Biden stays on, but others say replacing him comes with many unknowns. \nAmid the fallout of Mr Biden's disastrous debate performance, asking the president to step aside could bring some immediate relief.\nSome Democrats, including avowed supporters of the president, have said as much, suggesting that concerns about his age and mental acuity had grown difficult to overcome. \nThe debate \"rightfully raised questions among the American people about whether the president has the vigour to defeat Donald Trump\", said California Representative Adam Schiff on Sunday. \nMr Schiff stopped short of saying Biden should drop out in his interview with NBC News - a position taken publicly by five House Democrats so far. \nInstead, Mr Schiff urged him to seek advice from people with \u201cdistance and objectivity\u201d and make a decision about whether he believes he is the best candidate to run.\n\"Given Joe Biden's incredible record, given Donald Trump's terrible record, he [Biden] should be mopping the floor with Donald Trump,\" Mr Schiff said. \"It should not be even close and there's only one reason it is close, and that's the president's age.\" \nMr Biden is 81, while Trump has just turned 78. The ages of both candidates have become an increasingly contentious point among voters.\nOn the left, polls suggest some voters are losing faith in Mr Biden. In a Wall Street Journal poll released on Friday, 86% of Democrats said they would support Mr Biden, down from 93% in February.\nA different candidate may also offer a clean slate in other areas, too. Before this wave of Democratic panic, Mr Biden drew criticism from voters on several policy fronts, including his handling of the US economy and the migrant crisis at the country's southern border. \n \nThe president faced a threat of defection from progressive voters who oppose his response to Israel's war in Gaza. Their resistance cost him more than 100,000 votes in Michigan - a crucial swing state - during its primary in February. \nA Biden ticket \"is going to drag everybody else down\", said former Ohio Representative Tim Ryan on Sunday in an interview with Fox News. \"I think you're going to see a significant amount of pressure whether it's today or tomorrow, sometime this week, as members come back that this may be untenable for them.\" \nAny benefit to losing Mr Biden may be muted by the looming risks, according to some Democratic leaders. \nIf the president stood aside, most of what comes after remains unclear: who would replace Mr Biden, and how? And how would that candidate fare against Trump? \nAnd in recent days, several Biden allies have stressed the pitfalls of charting a new course, arguing that Mr Biden has been a proven success.  \n\"Biden is old,\" said Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, 82, on CBS News on Sunday. \"He is not as articulate as he once was. I wish he could jump up the steps on Air Force One. He can't. What we have got to focus on is policy - whose policies have and will benefit the vast majority of the people in this country.\" \nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, who spent the weekend stumping for the president, said the same at a rally in Doylestown, Pennsylvania on Saturday. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the hypothetical that gets in the way of progress in terms of promoting this candidacy,\u201d Mr Newsom said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly where the other party wants us to be, is having this internal fight, and I think it\u2019s extraordinarily unhelpful.\u201d\nMr Biden's public supporters say replacing him may become a direct benefit to Trump's Republicans, who can argue their opponents are engulfed in party chaos. \n\"We've got to stop talking about this,\" Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan said on CNN on Sunday. \"We've spent a whole week. Republicans are having a gr",

    "BBC Verify has been fact-checking the political parties during this election campaign and seen some questionable claims at the forefront of the debate.\nIf you are still making up your mind before heading to the polls, here is what you need to know about some of the potentially misleading statements the parties have made.\nThis figure risks misleading people because it adds up four years of supposedly extra taxes resulting from Labour\u2019s manifesto spending plans.\nIt was asserted by Rishi Sunak 11 times in the first leaders\u2019 debate and he has been using it on social media ever since.\nThat is not what you would normally think of if somebody said your taxes were going up by \u00a32,000 - you'd think they meant in a single year.\nThe Office for Statistics Regulation has said \u201csomeone hearing the claim would have no way of knowing that this is an estimate summed together over four years\u201d.\nThe Conservatives also said the costings of Labour\u2019s plans were worked out by impartial civil servants, but some are based on assumptions made by politically appointed special advisers. Labour disputes the figures. \nYou can read more here. \nThis figure - unveiled at a press conference by the shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves - is based on some questionable assumptions about how much the Conservatives would have to borrow if they won the election and the impact of this borrowing on Bank of England interest rates.\nIt has been posted multiple times on Facebook and also posted on X by Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves.\nThe Conservatives say they will be able to pay for their planned tax cuts by saving \u00a312bn a year from the welfare bill. Labour's calculations assume they would make none of these savings at all, which is probably unrealistic.\nAlso, the \u00a34,800 figure is the supposed extra mortgage costs on a household added up over five years, not the cost falling in a single year, which risks misleading people.\nThe statistics regulator has called for more context and transparency around how this figure was reached. \nYou can read more here. \nThe Liberal Democrats\u2019 election literature has had a heavy emphasis on tactical voting in this election and, as in other years, has used a lot of bar charts.\nIn one constituency in this campaign, a leaflet shows the party\u2019s local vote share in 2010 and Labour\u2019s share in 2017, two cherry picked years.\nThe claim that \"only the Liberal Democrats can beat the Conservatives here\" is misleading. \nIf they had selected 2019, then the chart would have shown the Lib Dems on 15.1% and Labour on 24.8%.\nThe chart also misses out the vote share of the Conservatives who have actually held the seat since 2010.\nThe Office for Statistics Regulation says \u201cpolling or election results data should be visualised in a way that does not mislead the average reader about the relative support for different parties\u201d.\nSome Lib Dem campaign literature - as well as some produced by other parties in areas of the country - does not pass that test.\nOther leaflets have used local election results as a guide to the general election, which can be unreliable, or they have exaggerated the size of their bars in the chart to boost their apparent performance.\nYou can read more here. \nPicking up small-boat migrants in the English Channel and returning them to France is a core Reform UK pledge. Party chairman Richard Tice has repeatedly claimed the UK is legally entitled to do this.\nBut there is no evidence that this is the case.\nWhile international maritime laws allow a state to pick people up at sea if they are \u201cin danger of being lost\u201d, they do not allow them to be taken to another state without that country agreeing.\nAccording to James M Turner KC, a shipping lawyer at Quadrant Chambers: \"The French would have to grant express permission for UK vessels to carry rescued people through their territorial waters and to leave them ashore in France.\"\nAinhoa Camp\u00e0s Velasco, a maritime law expert from the University of Southampton, said migrants could not be returned to French shores \u201cwithout prior agreement with France\".\nThere is no such agreement between the UK and France.

    "A disagreement within the Labour Party has put the two-child benefit cap back in the spotlight. What is the policy, and why is it controversial?\nThe two-child cap prevents parents from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third child, with a few exemptions.\nThese benefits help with the cost of raising a child. Parents and carers might be able to get them if their children are under 16 or, if they are in eligible training, up to the age of 20.\nThe sum they are given depends on their income, how many children are living with them, and their childcare costs.\nThe cap, which came into effect in April 2017, was among changes to the benefits system which were announced by then Chancellor George Osborne in 2015.\nAt the time the Conservative government said it wanted people on benefits \"to make the same choices as those supporting themselves solely through work\".\nAround 1.6 million children lived in a household affected by the policy last year, according to the latest statistics from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP).  \nThe number of households affected by the cap has increased every year since the policy was introduced, going from 71,000 UK-wide in 2017 to 450,000 in 2024. \nThe cap was opposed by anti-poverty campaigners.\nThe Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland said that abolishing the cap, which it estimated would cost \u00a31.3bn, would lift 250,000 children in the UK out of poverty. That included up to 15,000 in Scotland. \nBarnardo's chief executive Lynn Perry called the limit \"one of the biggest policy drivers of child poverty\" and said it should be scrapped.\nAnd research from the Resolution Foundation think tank found that six out of 10 families affected by the two-child limit were already in work. \nThere has also been controversy over what became known as the rape clause.\nOne of the exceptions to the rules was for a child born as a result of \"non-consensual conception\".\nThe UK government was accused of forcing victims of rape to endure further trauma, making women \"prove\" they have been raped to receive child benefits.\nHowever, the Conservatives insisted that the system ensured that women who had a child through rape would not be denied tax credits.\nThe most recent figures from the DWP showed that around 200 households in Scotland had been given an exemption because the child was conceived by non-consensual sex.\nCampaigners brought a legal challenge against the two-child limit, arguing that the policy breached parents' and children's human rights.\nThe Supreme Court dismissed their case in 2021.\nThe policy has been a thorny subject for the Labour Party, both when they were in opposition and now they are in government.\nSir Keir Starmer told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme a year ago that the policy would not change under a Labour government.\nSir Keir said he would not commit extra money to benefits without first growing the economy.\nHe quickly faced a backlash from across his party for his refusal to abolish the two-child limit. \nIn an interview with the Daily Record, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said he would press Sir Keir to scrap the policy if Labour won power.\nDeputy leader Jackie Baillie then told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that Scottish Labour was \"very clear, we remain opposed to the two-child benefit cap\".\nDuring the election campaign other parties used the benefit cap as an attack line on both Conservatives and Labour.\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn described UK Labour's stance on the issue as \"utterly shameful\" and First Minister John Swinney said it was \"indefensible\".\nHowever while visiting Scotland Sir Keir repeated his belief that it would not be financially possible to axe the benefit. \nThat put him at odds with some political heavyweights in his own party, with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown telling Radio 4's Today programme that the cap is \"condemning children to poverty.\"\nScottish Labour have continued to demand that the cap be scrapped.\nThis week Mr Sarwar told the Daily Record newspaper that the limit is \"wrong\" and \"needs to be reversed\".\nHowever he added that he was \"pushing at an open door\" as he believes the prime minister is keen to remove the cap as soon as financially possible. \nWendy Chamberlain, the deputy leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats said scrapping the act would be the \"quickest and most cost-effective way\" to help children out of poverty.\nMr Sarwar's calls came as DWP statistics showed a total of 440,000 households across the UK were not receiving benefits for at least one child because of the policy.\nOf that number, 59%, or 270,000, have at least one parent \"in work\".\nAnd of those households affected, 26,000,  or 6%, are in Scotland - a 7.7% increase on the previous year's figure of 24,160. \nA further 1,000 or so Scottish households were granted an exception.\nThe figures also revealed that the most affected council area in Scotland is in Glasgow (4,500 households) followed by Fife (2,100) and ",
    "Cornwall Council has been accused of being \"too silly for words\" after telling a church a makeshift ramp used for disabled access was an \"obstruction\".\nIn a letter to St Bartholomew's Church in Lostwithiel, Cornwall Highways said a wooden sleeper on the kerb was \"considered to be a significant obstruction to highway users\" and demanded its removal.\nThe church said the ramp had been on Church Lane for more than 30 years to allow access for people with disabilities.\nCornwall Council said it had to act on potential issues but it would not be taking \"immediate action\".\nReverend Sheila Bawden said the language in the council's initial letter was \"absolutely appalling\", adding: \"Don't you think they should have come and discussed it with the church first?\"\nThe ramp outside the church is located just off the kerbstones and has worn down to a few inches in height.\nIn the letter, seen by the BBC, the authority said: \"Cornwall Council has the power to remove objects from the highway which are causing an obstruction or nuisance and to recover any expenses incurred.\"\nMs Bawden said the ramp was used by people in wheelchairs, people with walkers and undertakers carrying coffins on a trolley.\n\"If we remove it all these people cannot access the church,\" she said.\n\"It's the other side of double yellow lines so nobody should be parking here.\"\nSimon Brewer is the captain of the bell ringers at St Bart's and he uses a mobility scooter. \n\"I think it's too silly for words,\" he said.\n\"I expect a little scallywag has been going around with a bit of paper and wanted to take up a bit of wood.\n\"It'll stop people, like myself with my scooter, coming in to church. \n\"I've never heard anything so ridiculous in my life.\"\nChris Hoddinott has a mobility scooter and also uses the ramp to get into St Bart's. \n\"This church is open to everyone for lots of different reasons, we celebrate all sorts of things and that piece of wood gives us access,\" she said. \nShelia Hanson also uses a mobility scooter and said she would not be able to worship at the church or attend choir without the ramp.\nCornwall Council said it had a responsibility to the users of the highway and it had to act on issues identified as potentially hazardous.\n\"We will look at the options for how we can support the church to improve access,\" it said.\n\"In the meantime, while we will not be taking any immediate action on this matter, we have reminded the church of their liabilities should any accidents occur relating to the temporary ramp.\"\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A high-tech prosthetic leg enables amputees to walk naturally and at normal speeds without consciously thinking about it, a study suggests.\nDeveloped by scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the bionic leg links the user's brain activity to nerves in important muscles controlling movement.\nStudy author Prof Hugh Herr said the results of a small trial were \"quite miraculous\" and could influence the way prosthetic limbs are constructed in future.\nBut there are years of development work still to be carried out before it can be used by more patients.\nThere are lots of limitations to the way current artificial limbs are able to move, say the researchers in Nature Medicine.\nTheir quest was to test whether new technology could make walking with a leg amputation below the knee more natural.\nNormally, during amputation, muscles are wrapped up to create soft padding for maximum comfort when using an artificial leg.\nBut this means control of nerves and natural leg movements are lost.\nWith the new technology, surgery to reconnect vital pairs of muscles on the leg stump is needed first - either during the amputation or later on.\nThen, using sensors on these muscles, signals are sent to a robotic controller which helps the prosthetic leg calculate how much to bend the ankle and how much power to deliver when walking.\nInformation from muscle nerves is communicated to the prosthesis and then back to the patient, resembling the way a real limb works.\n\"So when the amputee thinks, they feel the limb moving naturally \u2013 those muscles move as they did when the limb was intact,\" Prof Herr told journalists on a briefing.\n\"It's as if they are able to feel their phantom limb and its movement,\" he added.\nAnd all through greater control from the human nervous system.\nIn a study on 14 amputees who had all lost one leg below the knee, seven were given the new \"neuroprosthetic interface\" during amputation and the other seven were given standard amputation care.\nTheir walking was then tested over flat ground, going up ramps and over obstacles.\nThose with the new technology had a walking speed 41% faster than the other group - equivalent to people who have not lost a leg, the study found.\nThey were also better able to deal with slopes, go up and down steps and navigate obstructions.\n\u201cOne of the main findings here is that a small increase in neural feedback from your amputated limb can restore significant bionic neural controllability,\" said study author Hyungeun Song. \nThis could help amputees to move more naturally and freely, to the extent they could dance and run.\nAccording to MIT researchers, about 60 patients around the world have received this type of surgery so far, which can also be done for people with arm amputations.\n",
    "Stormont\u2019s economy minister is proposing a package of significant changes to employment law including an effective ban on zero hour contracts in Northern Ireland.\nConor Murphy set out the details in an Assembly statement on Monday.\nHe has launched a consultation with the aim of introducing new legislation in late 2025.\nZero hour contracts allow employers to hire staff with no guarantee of the hours they will work.\nMr Murphy said zero hour contracts could be replaced with a \"banded hours\u2019\" system, similar to one in the Republic of Ireland.\nUnder that system a banded contract gives a worker the right to work an average of the hours in a specified band for 12 months.\nThere are eight bands covering a certain number of hours per week, for example, 6-11 or 11-16 hours per week.\nThe Labour Party has also promised to end \"exploitative\" zero hour contracts and \"one sided flexibility\" if it wins the general election.\nLabour\u2019s measures would not automatically apply in Northern Ireland as employment law is largely devolved.\nMr Murphy\u2019s proposals also include the right to a week\u2019s unpaid carers leave in any 12-month period, which would bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK.\nMr Murphy said it was his ambition that there should be paid carers leave but that would cost the Stormont budget up to \u00a360m unless a similar scheme was introduced in Great Britain.\nA further proposal is that people should have the right to request flexible working as soon as they start a job rather than having to wait six months.\nMr Murphy said this was a move which could help to tackle economic inactivity.\nHe is also suggesting that statutory paternity leave could be taken in two, one-week blocks rather than having to be taken in a single two-week block as at present.\nThe consultation will run until the end of September with the responses informing the draft legislation.\nGerry Murphy, from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, said the proposals \"would be the most substantial act from the NI Assembly for workers since devolution and the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement\".\nRetail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said it was a \"substantial and potentially far-reaching draft programme of legislation\" which \"must work for both business of all sizes and workers alike\".\n\n",

She is now the MP for Leeds West and Pudsey. \nShe became Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s shadow chancellor after the party's defeat in the 2021 Hartlepool by-election, and Labour\u2019s win puts her in the key position in government.\nMs Reeves says she wants to stick to current strict spending plans and has wooed the City of London, getting business leaders past and present to endorse Labour\u2019s economic plans.\nPolitics runs in the family as her younger sister, Ellie Reeves, has been a Labour MP since 2017.\nWes Streeting has shadowed the role since November 2021.\nHe immediately ruffled feathers when promoted to the shadow role by saying he wouldn\u2019t \"pretend the NHS was the envy of the world\" and has insisted the service would need to reform under a Labour government.\nHowever, the Ilford North MP has also had very personal reasons to praise the NHS, after he was diagnosed and treated for kidney cancer earlier in 2021, then aged 38.\nHe wrote about the experience in a memoir in which he also described growing up in a council flat in London\u2019s East End, visiting his bank robber grandfather in jail and growing up as a gay Christian.\nFirst elected to Parliament in 2015, Mr Streeting had previously been president of the National Union of Students, and served as a London councillor.\nBorn to Guyanese parents in north London and raised by his mother from the age of 12 after his father left them, David Lammy became the first black Briton to study a masters in law at Harvard.\nAt 27, he became Parliament\u2019s youngest MP when he was elected in Tottenham in 2000 before becoming a junior minister under Sir Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\nEd Miliband is best known as a former Labour leader having beaten his elder brother David, among others, in the leadership contest that followed the party\u2019s 2010 general election defeat.\nRecently, the north Londoner has grabbed the headlines for his commitment to tackling climate change, in particular his support for the party's now scaled-back Green Prosperity Plan to invest in green industries. \nAlthough he has been the MP for Doncaster North since 2005, he has been at the centre of Labour politics for even longer, working for Labour MPs before the 1997 election win and as a special adviser to Mr Brown when he became chancellor.\nMr Miliband's mother is a Polish Jew and human rights campaigner who survived the Holocaust while his father was a Belgian-born Polish Jewish Marxist academic. \nThe family lived in Primrose Hill, Camden, a house which David has owned since 2010.  \nSince 2017 he has also co-hosted the Reasons to be Cheerful podcast.\nA veteran parliamentarian, Hilary Benn, from Hammersmith in west London, has represented Leeds Central from 1999 to 2024. He is now the MP for Leeds South.\nNot a stranger to the cabinet table, having served under Labour prime ministers Sir Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\nIn opposition, he has been a leading Labour figure, serving as shadow foreign secretary and chairman of the Brexit select committee.\nHe is the son of veteran left-wing campaigner Tony Benn, who served in the cabinet under Labour prime ministers Harold Wilson and James Callaghan.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The RHS Flower Show at Tatton Park will showcase an array of perfectly pruned displays when it opens next week.\nBut a few miles down the road in Widnes there is a garden whose imperfections are its virtue. \nTucked away behind Ditton Community Centre near the town centre, the Wonky Garden\u2019s ethos is in its name. \nNothing has to be perfect, and none of the trustees or founding members who created the thriving community space is paid.\nTheir reward, they say, is in sharing with others the fruits of their labours. \nThe Wonky Garden was set up in 2019 by Angela Hayler, originally from Liverpool.\nShe said it has tripled in size since then. \n\"Our volunteers, who are here for their own physical and mental health, are looking after the garden,\" she said. \n\"They are nurturing it; they're growing vegetables; they're growing fruits; growing flowers. \n\"But then we're gifting them to the community. \n\"It is another way that we can actually get more joy out there.\"\nIn 2021 volunteers at the Wonky Garden prepared bunches of freshly cut flowers as gifts for people stuck at home due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \nFruit and vegetables grown in the garden are given away to local foodbanks, and Angela's team helps other community groups pick up skills to help them transform other spaces. \nEach member of the team has their own personal reason for getting stuck in.\nMary Roberts, who bakes cakes for her fellow volunteers once a month and on their birthdays, said she was \"lost\" after the death of her husband. \nMary bumped into Wonky Garden volunteer Jean Beesley while shopping in Tesco and was invited to try it out. \nMary said: \"I've been here three years now and I love it. \n\"We have fun, we have laughs, I make cakes. \n\"Everything is fun. We work and we produce things for people and for charity.\" \nMary added: \"We never squabble. We have fun between all of us. I feel as though I'm at home and I always have done.\"\nFor Jean, part of the fun is the interactions between the younger generations who visit the space and older members. \n\"Sometimes younger people don't really mix with elderly people\", she said. \n\"They quite enjoy it because we tell them things that we've done.\n\"They've not seen us when we were young: they'd be surprised if they saw me in the 1960s in a mini skirt.\"\nFor Jean, the garden is special. \n\"We enjoy coming, we learn stuff, we're outside.\n\"And you forget other worries when you come here\", she added.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A prominent New Zealand couple visiting California were targeted as they left a shopping centre by a crew of suspected robbers who left one of the pair dead.\nThe couple - banker Doug and Patricia \u201cTrish\u201d McKay - had been shopping at Newport Beach's Fashion Island when they were attacked by a group of men on 2 July, officials said.\nMs McKay, 68, a friend of New Zealand's prime minister, was killed when she was dragged along a road in the ensuing events, the Orange County District Attorney's Office added.\nThree suspects have been charged with murder. \nDetailing the incident, which took place about 45 miles (72km) south-east of Los Angeles, the DA said two men wearing masks jumped out of a vehicle as the couple waited to be picked up. \nThey allegedly pointed a gun at Mr McKay's head, ordered him to the ground and demanded he hand over the expensive watch he was wearing.\nOne man attacked Ms McKay, trying to take her shopping bags. He is accused of throwing her to the ground and dragging her into the road.\nMr McKay jumped in front of the car and tried to stop his wife from being run over, but a third man driving the car accelerated, the DA's news release stated.\nThe car pushed Mr McKay out of the way but the trio dragged his wife 65 ft (20m) under the vehicle, killing her.\nA bystander tried to stop the group from fleeing and was shot at by one of the men during the incident.\nThe suspects allegedly led authorities on a high-speed chase for nearly 40 miles. They were arrested and identified as Leroy Ernest Joseph McCrary, 26, Malachi Eddward Darnell, 18, and Jaden Cunningham, 18.\nAll three were charged with murder with a felony enhancement that makes them eligible for the death penalty, according to the DA's office. One of the suspects, Mr McCrary, is also facing charges of second-degree robbery and evading while driving recklessly.\nIt is unclear who is legally representing each of the men.\nDoug McKay, 69, is a prominent businessman and banker in New Zealand. He was the first CEO of the Auckland Council, a body established in 2010 that helps govern the Auckland Region of the country.  \nHe was also the former chair of the Bank of New Zealand, according to the Los Angeles Times. \nThe family released a statement to local media, saying: \"No words can express our sadness as we try to come to terms with the loss\". \nThe couple's personal friend, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, paid tribute. \n\"My thoughts are with the McKay family after the devastating loss of Trish,\" Mr Luxon posted on X. \"They\u2019re great people and my heart goes out to Doug, their family and all those who knew Trish.\"\nDesley Simpson, the deputy mayor of Auckland, said on Facebook that she was \"in absolute shock\".\n\"Trish was amazing - funny, loyal and loving. My absolute deepest sympathies to Doug and (Ms McKay's) family,\" Ms Simpson said.\n",
    "Palestinians and the UN have criticised what an anti-settlement watchdog says is Israel's largest seizure of land in the occupied West Bank in more than three decades.\nAbout 12.7 sq km (4.9 sq miles) of the Jordan Valley was declared \u201cstate property\u201d in June, denying Palestinians there private ownership and usage rights, according to the Peace Now group.\nThe declaration also created \u201cterritorial continuity\u201d between Israeli settlements in a key corridor bordering Jordan, the group said.\nA Palestinian official said the seizure was designed to dispossess Palestinians, while the UN criticised it as \u201ca step in the wrong direction\u201d for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe declaration was welcomed by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - a far-right settler who has authority over settlement policies in the coalition government and who considers the West Bank as part of a \u201cGreater Israel\u201d.\nIsrael has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land the Palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 Middle East war.\nThe vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.\nThe seizure approved by Israel\u2019s Civil Administration last month - but only made  public on Wednesday - covers an area north of the settlement of Yafit that had mostly been designated as a nature reserve or as an Israeli military \u201cfire area\u201d.\n\"The size of the area designated for declaration is the largest since the Oslo Accords,\u201d Peace Now said, referring to the 1993 interim peace deal that set out how parts of the West Bank and Gaza would be governed by the Palestinian Authority until a permanent peace settlement could be reached.\nThe group added that 2024 \u201cmarks a peak in the extent of declarations of state land,\" with a total of 23.7 sq km seized since the start of the year, including 8 sq km of land adjoining the latest area that is connected to the settlement of Masua.\nPeace Now accused Mr Smotrich and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being \u201cdetermined to fight against the entire world and against the interests of the people of Israel for the benefit of a handful of settlers\u201d over resolving Israel\u2019s political crisis or ending the war in Gaza.\n\u201cToday, it is clear to everyone that this conflict cannot be resolved without a political settlement that establishes a Palestinian state alongside Israel,\u201d it said.\nWhen asked to comment, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters: \u201cFrankly, it's a step in the wrong direction. And the direction we want to be heading is to find a negotiated two-state solution.\u201d\nThe head of the Palestinian Authority\u2019s Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission, Muayyad Shaaban, meanwhile said the seizure was \u201cpart of a large plan aimed at controlling the eastern part of the West Bank\u201d, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nIsraeli media reported that Mr Smotrich welcomed the declaration along with the news that the Israeli military\u2019s Higher Planning Council was holding a two-day meeting to advance plans for 5,300 new settler homes in the West Bank, and the security cabinet\u2019s decision last week to retroactively authorise five settlement outposts built without official government approval.\n\u201cThank God, we are building and developing the settlements and thwarting the danger of a Palestinian state,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\nLast month, Peace Now released a taped recording of Mr Smotrich outlining in a speech to a conference for his Religious Zionism party a series of moves that the campaign group warned would irreversibly change the way the West Bank was governed and lead to \u201cde facto annexation\u201d.\nIt said they included the completion of transferring the management of settlements from the military to civilian officials; the creation of a \u201clegalisation bypass route\u201d for settlement outposts; expanding the authorisation of agricultural outposts; and cracking down on unauthorised Palestinian construction.\nIn return for the retroactive authorisation of the five settlement outposts, Mr Smotrich reportedly agreed to unfreeze the last three months of tax revenues withheld from the Palestinian Authority and to extend a waiver protecting Israeli banks that work with Palestinian banks.\nThe US had urged Israel to release the funds, warning that further economic hardship for Palestinians could lead to more violence in the West Bank. \nThe UN says more than 530 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have been killed in the territory since the start of the war in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October.",
    "Human bones dated to be more than 1,000 years old have been discovered in the garden of a hotel, with 24 skeletons found alongside bones belonging to a number of others.\nThe Anglo-Saxon remains of men, women and children were found in the grounds of The Old Bell Hotel in Malmesbury, which is next door to Malmesbury Abbey, in Wiltshire.\nThe remains are from 670 to 940 AD, so include the very earliest days of the abbey, when it was a monastery.\nMalmesbury Abbey historian Tony McAleavy said the results are significant, especially because the place \"at this time was one of the leading centres of scholarship in western Europe\".\nMalmesbury Abbey historian and local resident Tony McAleavy said he \"was off the scale excited\".\n\"What we've got here is not a collection of the bodies of monks - it's men, women and children,\" he added.\nCotswold Archaeology was called in last year to excavate as part of planning conditions for some building work and now details have been revealed.\nFrom written sources, the area is believed to have been part of the monastic development.\nMr McAleavy added: \"It looks like we've found traces of the community of people to helped the monks here. \n\"It's going to shed new light on the way Malmesbury Abbey worked in its golden age.\"\nWhile there is writing discussing the town's Saxon past, experts say this find has finally provided physical evidence.\nPaulo Guarino from Cotswold Archaeology said: \"We knew from historical sources that the monastery was founded in that period but we never had solid evidence before this excavation.\n\"We use maximum respect. \n\"We knew from the very beginning how important it was.\"\nKim and Whit Hanks own the hotel and are from Texas. they said they had been learning more about the history over time. \n\"Living in a community with so much history is so exciting to us. \n\"This town is so open and wants the story to be told,\" said Ms Hanks. \nThe announcement comes as Malmesbury celebrates Athelstan 1100, a series of events marking the reign of Anglo-Saxon King Athelstan, the first King of all England, who chose to be buried in the town.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Former Post Office chair Tim Parker has denied deliberately hiding a key report he commissioned into the Horizon IT system from members of the Post Office board.\nThe 2016 report, written by former top Treasury lawyer Jonathan Swift, raised concerns about the accounting software which was later found to be faulty.   \nIncorrect data from Horizon led to the wrongful conviction of 700 sub-postmasters for theft and fraud between 1999 and 2015. \nOn Wednesday, an inquiry into the scandal heard that only four copies of the Swift report were made, none of which were shared with the Post Office board or the government.\nMr Parker said he had been acting on advice from Post Office lawyers not to share the document.\n\"It's one of my regrets that I got this advice and I took it,\" he said. \"Could we have shared it? I wish we had, in a way.\n\"I've had this report commissioned, I wanted to get some kind of result from it, but then I get this advice.\"\nAll subpostmaster convictions have now been quashed, but many people went to prison or lost their businesses. \nThe Swift report was commissioned by the government following a BBC Panorama programme in 2015 that raised concerns about the strength of evidence against those convicted.\nAlthough supportive of the Post Office in parts, it raised key concerns about whether the Post Office had enough evidence to bring charges of theft. \nIt also cast doubt over claims that Horizon data could not be altered remotely by Fujitsu, the company that developed the software.\nThis turned out to be untrue, and may have deprived subpostmasters of an important line of defence at their trials.    \nMr Parker, who became chair of the Post Office in October 2015, and remained in the role until September 2022, told the inquiry that top Post Office lawyer Jane MacLeod had advised him not to share the Swift report because it was legally privileged. \nThat meant it had the same confidential status as communications between a lawyer and a client.  \nMr Parker said he was told that breaching this could have resulted in the report being made public, and that it needed to be kept within the \"tightly knit\" Post Office legal team.\n\nWhen challenged by inquiry lead counsel Jason Beer, Mr Parker conceded that by doing this he had prevented the board from discussing the report's findings.\nHowever, he said he believed that the Post Office legal team would \"take forward\" the report's recommendations and denied hiding it for improper motives.\n\"What possible motive would I have had at the time from hiding this report from my fellow board members, other than receiving advice that I shouldn't share it?\" he said.\n\"Bear in mind I had no axe to grind on this, I had no vested interest in trying to protect the Post Office.\"\nHe continued: \"With hindsight of course, it would appear there were motives perhaps underpinning some of the advice or direction of this that were not wholly fair or right or in the interests of people who'd be wronged. \n\"At the time, however, it seemed to me that the people giving me advice... were doing this in good faith and it was the right thing to do.\"\nIn later questioning, lawyer Sam Stein said as chair Mr Parker had been \"part time\" and his decisions had been \"part baked\".\nMr Parker initially worked one and a half days per week on his Post Office responsibilities, and later dropped this down to half a day per week.\nBut Mr Parker rejected Mr Stein's characterisation, saying: \"I don\u2019t accept that. I gave sufficient time and attention to the Post Office. I\u2019m sorry.\"\n\nAfter the Swift review, auditors Deloitte were commissioned in February 2016 to look through Horizon transactions going back to 1999.\nBut this probe was dropped in June 2016 after sub-postmasters led by campaigner Sir Alan Bates launched legal action against the Post Office.\nMr Parker acknowledged that had the report not been secret, the Post Office may have taken a different approach to the High Court action which it lost at a cost of more than \u00a3100m.\nBut he also said that by that stage it may have needed a judge to resolve all the issues.",
    "A newly elected Green Party MP has called for a \"pause\" on a proposed 114-mile (184-km) electricity pylon route across East Anglia.\nThe National Grid wants to build the new power lines from Norwich to Tilbury in Essex, which it has called \"vital infrastructure\".\nAdrian Ramsay, the Waveney Valley MP, said the proposal required a \"proper options assessment\" that should be considered by the new Labour government.\nThe government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the public consultation was ongoing, but the UK needed to improve \"outdated\" energy infrastructure.\nHaving arrived for his first day at the House of Commons, Mr Ramsay, who is the Greens' co-leader nationally, said: \"There's a controversial proposal... where there's huge local concern about the impact on agricultural land, on traffic, on local communities, on the landscape.\n\"So what I'm arguing for is a pause while the other options are considered, because of course we need the infrastructure; it's a matter of doing it in the right way that has a long-term benefit.\"\nNational Grid, a private firm, wants to build the power line to carry 50 gigawatts of electricity generated by offshore windfarms and has said the previous government had set a target of doing this by 2030.\nApart from underground sections beneath the River Stour and Dedham Vale and at Great Horkesley in Essex, it would be carried on pylons.\nMr Ramsay said Green councillors who run Mid Suffolk District Council had been arguing for an alternative to be properly considered, including the idea of an offshore grid.\nBut in a statement, National Grid said it had carefully assessed several alternative options, including offshore options, adding it had shaped its policy around public consultations already undertaken. \n\"Delaying this vital infrastructure project would not only result in missing this target, but also delay homes and businesses in East Anglia and beyond having access to cleaner and more affordable electricity in the long term,\" it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Ramsay welcomed the decision by Labour to lift a de facto ban on onshore wind farms.\n\"That is welcome, yes, absolutely we need to see more renewable energy in the UK of various sorts, done in the right way, and so Labour have taken a step in the right direction with that,\" he said.\nHe also called for \"a nationwide programme to get people's homes insulated in a way that keeps bills down, keeps homes warm, and that's something we'll be pushing the government to do much more on\".\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"Securing Britain's clean energy future requires improving outdated infrastructure to get renewable electricity on the grid and unleash its true potential.\n\"National Grid has put the Norwich to Tilbury proposals out for public consultation and like all infrastructure, these proposals would be subject to a rigorous planning permission process.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Danny Dyer has spoken about having a \"major panic attack\" after forgetting his lines on stage following a night taking drugs.\nThe former EastEnders actor played a waiter in Harold Pinter's Celebration, which transferred from London to New York's Lincoln Center in 2001.\nSpeaking on Elizabeth Day\u2019s How To Fail podcast, Dyer said he was \"very excited\" because he had never been to New York, and \"took a lot of drugs out there\".\n\"I'd heard about people that had dried on stage because it's a massive thing, and it never happened to me,\" he said.\n\"Anyway, I thought that I could sit up all night smoking crack and then walk on stage, and of course you can't do that. It's a ridiculous idea.\"\nHe said he froze when it came to one of his lines, and he \"didn't have a clue what to say\".\n\"And the worst thing was the other actors, who knew I'd been out, looking at me... Their faces were [turned] away from the audience, and it was just their horror,\" he said.\n\"I just remember being very aware of what I'm doing for the first time ever, questioning it, going, 'Oh my God, everyone's looking at me, waiting for me to speak'.\n\"I'd never had that feeling before. I love showing off. And then my lips started to go, because I was going to cry.\"\nDyer said he managed to continue the scene after somebody shouted out his line to him, before he made his exit.\n\"I come off stage going, 'I can't go back on, I can't'. I just had a major panic attack, but I just had to get on with it,\" he said.\n\"I thought, you put yourself in this situation, now get on with it.\n\"And then Harold came up to me after and he sort of gave me a cuddle and that made me worse, made me cry... And he went, 'If ever there's an ensemble piece, it's this, Danny'.\"\nDyer has frequently spoken about the influence the late playwright had on his life, and he hosted a documentary about Pinter in 2020.\nThe actor said the incident was a \"wake-up call\", and made him rethink his drug-taking \"for the duration of the play\".\n\"I thought, I'm not doing that again. Of course I had still quite a tricky many years of it after then.\"\nIn the podcast, Dyer spoke about eventually going to rehab in South Africa in 2016.\n\"It all just became too much for me.

    "A review of the Isle of Man Prison has found progress has been made with the management of vulnerable prisoners, but more still needs to be done to address other issues. \nIt follows an independent inspection into the facility last year by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons, the second of its kind since it opened in 2008.\nWhile support for vulnerable prisoners had improved, security procedures remained \"disproportionate\", an update to that review has found.\nChief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor said the findings were \"encouraging\". \nOf the 13 concerns highlighted in the 2023 review, the prison had addressed nine, the update said.\nIn the previous report it was noted that \"three self-inflicted deaths\" had occurred at the facility since 2020. \nHowever, the review said that there had been \"considerable effort\" to improve the care of at-risk prisoners. \nVulnerable individuals were now \"well supported\" and the \"management of their risk was more proportionate and the inappropriate use of 'special' unfurnished cells in the segregation unit had ceased\".\nGood progress had also been made in providing support to prisoners to address offending behaviour with the introduction of a psychology team, as well as group-work programmes and one-to-one interventions.\nBut \"more needed to be done\" to improve conditions for new arrivals, and security procedures remained \"disproportionate\", with \"excessive strip-searching\" of prisoners, the review found.\n\"No meaningful progress\" had been made to promote diversity and equality and, while most prisoners were employed, the majority of work roles did not provide \"realistic work conditions or training\" for future employment.\nHowever, the number of hours two thirds of prisoners were now occupied for with a combination of education and work had risen from 13.5, which the prison had considered as full-time employment during the last inspection, to 20.\nInitiatives were also planned to strengthen family ties, including the ability to attend parent evenings by video-link and a parenting skills course, the update said.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X?

    "Logan LaFreniere woke up one October morning in 2022 to an empty driveway.\nHis brand new Ram Rebel truck was missing. \nHis security camera captured two hooded men breaking into the pickup in the dead of night outside of his Milton, Ontario home, and driving it away with ease.\nA few months later, that very same truck appeared on a website of vehicles for sale in Ghana, an ocean and some 8,500km away.\n\u201cThe dead giveaway was the laptop holder that we had installed in the back of the driver\u2019s seat for my son, and in it was garbage that he had put in there,\u201d Mr LaFreniere told the BBC.\nThat same clutter was visible in photos of the car listing, he said.\n\u201cThere was no doubt in my mind that it was my vehicle.\u201d\nMr LaFreniere\u2019s story is hardly unique. In 2022, more than 105,000 cars were stolen in Canada - about one car every five minutes. Among the victims was Canada\u2019s very own federal justice minister, whose government-issued Toyota Highlander XLE was taken twice by thieves.\nEarly this summer, Interpol listed Canada among the top 10 worst countries for car thefts out of 137 in its database - a \u201cremarkable\u201d feat, said a spokesperson, considering the country only began integrating their data with the international police organisation in February.\nAuthorities say once these cars are stolen, they are either used to carry out violent crimes, sold domestically to other unsuspecting Canadians, or shipped overseas to be resold.\nInterpol says it has detected more than 1,500 cars around the world that have been stolen from Canada since February, and around 200 more continue to be identified each week, usually at ports in other countries.\nCar theft is such an epidemic that it was declared a \u201cnational crisis\u201d by the Insurance Bureau of Canada, which says insurers have had to pay out more than C$1.5bn ($1bn; \u00a3860m) in vehicle theft claims last year.\nThe problem has forced police jurisdictions across the country to issue public bulletins on how to protect vehicles from theft.\nMeanwhile, some Canadians have taken matters into their own hands, doing everything from installing trackers on their cars to hiring private neighbourhood security.\nSome who can afford it have even installed retractable bollards in their driveways - similar to those seen at banks and embassies - to try and deter thieves.\nNauman Khan, who lives in Mississauga, a city just outside Toronto, started a bollard-installation business after he and his brother were both victims of car thefts.\nIn one attempt, Mr Khan said the thieves broke into his home while his wife and young children were sleeping. They were looking for the keys to his Mercedes GLE parked out front, he said, but ran after he confronted them.\nAfter that \u201ctraumatic\u201d experience, they sold their cars except for two \u201chumble\u201d family vehicles.\nThrough his business, Mr Khan said he now hears similar stories from people throughout the region of Toronto.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very busy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had one client whose street had so many home invasions that he\u2019d hired a security guard every night outside his house because he just didn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d\nThe pervasiveness of car thefts in Canada is surprising given how small the country\u2019s population is compared to the US and the UK - other countries with high rates of such crime, says Alexis Piquero, Director of the US Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\u201c[Canada] also doesn\u2019t have as many port cities as the US does,\u201d said Mr Piquero.\nWhile the US, Canada and the UK have all experienced a spike in car thefts since the Covid-19 pandemic, Canada\u2019s rate of thefts (262.5 per 100,000 people) is higher than that of England and Wales (220 per 100,000 people), according to the latest available data from each country.\nIt is also fairly close to that of the US, which sits at around 300 vehicle thefts per 100,000 people, based on 2022 data.\nThe rise in recent years is partly due to a pandemic-driven global car shortage that has increased demand for both used and new vehicles. \nThere is also a growing market for certain car models internationally, making auto theft a top revenue generator for organised crime groups, said Elliott Silverstein, director of government relations at the Canadian Automobile Association.\nBut Mr Silverstein said the way that Canada\u2019s ports operate make them more vulnerable to this type of theft than other countries.\n\u201cIn the port system, there\u2019s a greater focus on what is coming into the country than what is exiting the country,\u201d he said, adding that once the vehicles are packed up in shipping containers at a port it becomes harder to get to them. \n\nPolice have managed to recover some stolen cars. \nIn October, the Toronto Police Service announced an 11-month investigation that recovered 1,080 vehicles worth around C$60m. More than 550 charges were laid as a result.  \nAnd between mid-December and the end of March, border and police officers found nearly 600 stolen vehicles at the Port of Montreal after inspecting 400 shipping containers.\nThese types of operations, h",
    "Sir Keir Starmer says he has great concerns over the future of Tata Steel as he visited Wales for the first time since becoming prime minister.\nHe met First Minister Vaughan Gething at the Senedd amid worries for employees at the giant Tata steelworks in Port Talbot, where thousands of people are facing redundancy.\nSir Keir's new Labour government has said there was \"a better deal available\" with Tata but warned newer technologies would employ fewer people.\nHowever, one union boss has said the UK government was \"right up against it\" if it wanted to delay the closure of Port Talbot\u2019s blast furnace and save jobs.\nRoy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community union, said there was a \"real opportunity\" to persuade Tata to keep blast furnace 4 operating beyond September.\nMr Rickhuss, whose union is the largest representing steelworkers in Port Talbot, said there were four to six weeks of negotiations to try and change direction but \"we are up against it, time-wise\".\n\"We're living in with this fear and uncertainty, it's not in their interest to prolong the debate. We need to have these discussions quick,\" he said. \nJason Balston, 56, has worked as a contractor at the steelworks for 26 years and said: \"I\u2019m head of the trade union in my company and I\u2019m going to see boys lose their jobs. I\u2019ve seen grown men cry alongside me.\n\"I\u2019m 56 and if I go, I go, but it\u2019s the youngsters I worry about with mortgages and young families. they\u2019ve not even thought about them.\n\"Once those works go this town is dead. It\u2019s going to affect from Bridgend all the way to Llanelli,\" he added.\nMarc Jerrard has been at the steelworks for 28 years and said: \u201cI think a lot of people accept the works is coming to the end of its life.\n\"Give us a plan of action - some sort of knowledge of what sort of workforce you\u2019re going to be requiring,\" he said. \"We just need some sort of clarity really.\u201d\nSir Keir told journalists it was \"very important for me to reset relations with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales\".\nHe said there had been \"too much\" conflict between the UK and Welsh governments over the past 14 years.\nHe said his election victory was a \"gamechanger\" which meant Labour government in Cardiff and London could work together.\n\"This is an early recommitment to what I said in the campaign, to come here physically on the third day, to have discussions with the first minister about the long term objectives and of course, about some of the pressing issues including Tata Steel\".\nSir Keir said Tata was \"of great concern to me, to the first minister, and so many of the people here in Wales\".\nAsked if he had been surprised by the state of the economy the prime minister said it was \"in a bad state\", but he thought that was why there had been such a strong mandate for change, which the government had to get on and deliver.\nCardiff was the last stop for the PM after visiting Edinburgh and Belfast over the past couple of days.\nAhead of the visit, Mr Gething told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the previous Tory government was an \"aggressive competitor\u201d, not a partner.\n\"The fact that there'll be an entirely new relationship will be a real benefit,\" he said.\nOn Tata, Mr Gething would not be drawn on how many jobs he expects to be saved by negotiations with the new government, but said he did not want to see any compulsory redundancies.\n\"Tata have gone ahead with lots of their plans and I think we can be confident that Tata wanted to finalise their plans with the former UK government still in office,\" said Mr Gething.\n\"Now there\u2019s a different government with a different mandate with more [money] available to co-invest with the company.\n\"However, that does mean we want a better deal than the one they had with the Tories.\"\nOn funding for HS2, the first minister said designating projects that only benefit England as England and Wales projects is \u201cobviously a problem\u201d.\nHowever, when asked about the UK Labour government giving no guarantees that Wales would receive any additional HS2 funding, Mr Gething said he wanted to see fairness in the system \"moving forward\".\nIn a statement ahead of the visit, Sir Keir said: \"Wales has enormous untapped potential ready to be unleashed.\n\"Working in lockstep with the Welsh government and Vaughan [Gething], my government will place the people and communities of Wales front and centre as we move towards a decade of national renewal.\n\"That means turning the page on years of economic hardship, towards genuine shared prosperity for working people, so they see and feel real tangible change in their lives.\"\nSir Keir is also visiting Northern Ireland on Monday, the day after he met leaders in Scotland.\nTata is cutting 2,800 jobs across the UK, with the bulk at Port Talbot.\nThousands of more jobs are expected to be lost in supply chains and other businesses which rely on workers at the plant, with the local economy predicted to lose \u00a3200m if the cuts go ahead.\nTata is closing its two blast furnaces at Port Talbot and replacing them ",

We had a lot of reports of damage to homes, houses, a few government buildings,\" he said. \nSt Vincent and the Grenadines, to the north-east of Grenada, was also devastated by Hurricane Beryl.\nIts Prime Minister, Ralph Gonsalves, said that at least one person had been killed by the storm.\nHe said that Storm Beryl had \"left in its wake immense destruction\".\nAccording to the prime minister, the situation on Union Island - a small island with around 3,000 inhabitants - was particularly dire. \n\"The reports that I have received indicate that 90% of the houses have been severely damaged or destroyed,\" he said.\nMr Gonsalves also warned that \"there may well be more fatalities, we are not yet sure\".\nThousands of people are still without power and many are in temporary shelters in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and St Lucia. \nFootage shared on social media showed homes with their roofs blown off and residents picking through rubble to salvage their possessions.\nBarbados, which had issued a hurricane warning as Storm Beryl approached, seems to have been spared major damage. \nA government official said that while the country had \"dodged a bullet\", people should not let down their guard as \"gusts are still coming, the storm-force winds are still coming\".\nMeteorologists from the National Hurricane Center say Beryl continues to strengthen as it moves through the south-eastern Caribbean.\nThe NHC warns Beryl is expected bring \"life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica later this week\", most likely on Wednesday afternoon local time. \nThe Jamaican government has issued a hurricane warning and people living in low-lying and flood-prone areas have been urged to seek shelter. \nA waiter in Kingston told Reuters news agency that the atmosphere in the Jamaican capital was calm. \n\"Jamaicans wait until the last minute. The night before or in the morning, the panic sets in. It's because we're used to this,\" he said.\nBut the mayor of the resort town of Montego Bay warned residents not to take a \"wait and see\" attitude and urged them to be \"prepared for anything\". \nBefore reaching Jamaica, Hurricane Beryl could also cause damage in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share the island of Hispaniola. \nHaiti, which has in the past been devastated by earthquakes and whose interim government is trying to wrest control of the capital from powerful gangs, is particularly poorly prepared for the devastation Beryl could cause.\nGuy Vital-Herne from the charity World Vision told the BBC that \"as of right now, Haiti is definitely not ready for something like that\".\n\"In the past, we've seen rains causing roads to flood, diminishing logistical capacities and even collapsing bridges. So it would be very catastrophic for Haiti to be highly impacted by Beryl right now.\"\nThe NHC said that Hurricane Beryl was the earliest category five storm in the Atlantic they had ever recorded, forming much earlier in the hurricane season than usual.\nMeteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed.\nThe storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane - category three or above - in only 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told Associated Press news agency.\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",

    "A Singapore court has sentenced a Japanese man to jail and caning for the \"brutal and cruel\" rape of a university student in 2019.\nThe 38-year-old hairdresser, Ikko Kita, is set to be the first Japanese national to be caned in the city state, the Japanese embassy in Singapore told BBC News.\nHe will be caned 20 times and also jailed for 17 and a half years. \nCaning is a controversial but widely used form of corporal punishment in Singapore, and is compulsory for offences like vandalism, robbery and drug trafficking.\nAccording to court documents, Kita met the woman at Clarke Quay, a popular nightlife district, in December 2019.\nThe woman, who was then 20, had not known Kita before. She was intoxicated when he took her to his flat and raped her.\nHe also filmed the act on his mobile phone and later sent it to a friend.\nThe victim managed to leave the apartment afterwards and reported the rape to police later that day. \nKita was arrested on the same day and has been in police custody since.\nPolice found two videos of the rape on his mobile phone.\nJustice Aedit Abdullah called the assault \"brutal and cruel\", adding that the victim was \"vulnerable, clearly drunk, and incapable of looking after herself\".\nThe judge also dismissed the defence's argument that the victim had allegedly given an initial indication of consent to sex. \nThe sentencing has been widely reported in Japan and has also been trending on social media. \nSome users have expressed shock at the use of caning in modern Singapore, though there have also been some celebrating the sentence. \nOne said that \"in Japan, when it comes to sexual assault, society and the police make victims feel guilty, and the punishment is far too lenient\".\n Singapore says caning acts as a deterrent to violent crime, though some rights groups say there is no clear evidence of this.\nCaning in Singapore involves being struck with a wooden stick on the back of the thigh, which can leave permanent scars.\nAccording to rights group the Transformative Justice Collective, the cane measures about 1.5m (4.9ft) and not more than 1.27cm in diameter. \nThe practice drew international attention in 1994 when 19-year-old US citizen Michael Fay was given six strokes of the cane for vandalism.\nDespite an appeal from US President Bill Clinton, Singapore authorities went ahead with the caning but gave Fay a reduced number of strokes.",

    "Small wild birds have demonstrated an ability to recall what they have eaten in the past, where they found it and when, a new study has shown.\nResearchers at the University of Cambridge and the University of East Anglia in Norwich (UEA) studied the feeding habits of blue tits and great tits.\nIn the \"first experiment of its kind to involve wild animals\", the birds exhibited an \"episodic-like\" memory to cope with changes in food availability when foraging.\nThat memory system - a \"conscious recollection of personally experienced events\" was previously thought to be \"uniquely human\", researchers said.\nThe study involved 94 wild blue and great tits in a series of memory tasks.\nBlue tits and great tits are \"opportunistic foragers\" which could benefit from being able to recall ecological details from a single experience as this would permit flexible decision-making, the study said. \nResearchers installed automated food containers and a software program that \"created unique experiences for individual birds, and tracked each bird\u2019s behaviour after they formed a memory\".\nThe birds were fitted with radio frequency tracking tags on their legs so that when they landed on the feeder\u2019s special perch, this read their tag, and food was released - or not released - through an electronic door, \"according to experimental rules with unique timed events specific to each individual bird\".\nFeeders were loaded with sunflower seeds, which the birds prefer - and peanut pieces \u2013 a food less favoured, both of which ran out and were replenished at different rates. \n\"All else being equal, birds prefer to eat sunflower hearts over peanuts,\" said the UEA's Dr Gabrielle Davidson.\n\"But once a bird starts to eat them, they become unavailable two hours later. \n\"Our experiments show that when birds come back to the feeders more than two hours later, they automatically go to where the peanuts are, even though it's not their favourite food, because they remember their previous experience.\"\nThe study concluded that after the preferred sunflower seed feeders stopped serving, the birds remembered this would be the case and so switched to the less preferred peanut feeders, which they remembered would still be serving food in that period of time.\nJames Davies, from the University of Cambridge\u2019s Comparative Cognition Lab, said: \"These findings provide the first evidence for episodic-like memory in the wild and show that blue and great tits have a more flexible memory system than we used to assume. \n\"Previous studies on episodic-like memory have involved bigger-brained bird species, corvids, which hide food. This study focuses on smaller-brained more generalist birds that don\u2019t hide their food. \n\"Our findings suggest these birds are more intelligent than they\u2019ve been given credit for.\"\nDr Davidson added: \"The birds were behaving naturally in a familiar environment, so we captured something more realistic than if the birds had been captive.\"\nThe study also might suggest that humans leaving out food for garden birds could be one factor contributing to the evolution of these memory traits, in the same way that birds have evolved beak adaptations in response to increased reliance on garden feeders, researchers said.\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "China's biggest electric-car maker, BYD, has agreed a $1bn (\u00a3780m) deal to set up a manufacturing plant in Turkey, as it continues to expand outside its home country.\nThe new plant will be able to produce up to 150,000 vehicles a year, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu.\nThe facility is expected to create around 5,000 jobs and start production by the end of 2026.\nThe deal was signed at an event in Istanbul attended by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and BYD's chief executive Wang Chuanfu.\nBYD did not immediately respond to a BBC request for further details on the deal.\nThe announcement comes as Chinese EV makers face increasing pressure in the European Union and the US.\nLast week, the EU took action to protect the bloc's motor industry by raising tariffs on Chinese EVs.\nThe decision saw BYD hit with an extra tariff of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU, which was on top of a 10% import duty.\nTurkey is part of the EU\u2019s Customs Union, which means vehicles made in the country and exported to the bloc can avoid the additional tariff.\nThe Turkish government has also taken action to support the country's car makers by putting an extra 40% tariff on imports of Chinese vehicles.\nIn May, US President Joe Biden ramped up tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars, solar panels, steel and other goods.\nThe White House said the measures, which include a 100% border tax on electric cars from China, were a response to unfair policies and intended to protect US jobs.\nBYD, which is backed by veteran US investor Warren Buffett, is the world\u2019s second-largest EV company after Elon Musk's Tesla.\nThe company has been rapidly expanding its production facilities outside China.\nAt the end of last year, BYD announced that it would build a manufacturing plant in EU member state Hungary.\nIt will be the firm's first passenger car factory in Europe and is expected to create thousands of jobs.\nOn Thursday, BYD opened an EV plant in Thailand - its first factory in South East Asia.\nBYD said the plant will have an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles and is projected to generate 10,000 jobs.\nThe company has also said it is planning to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico.",
    "A teenager who died when a school bus crashed on a motorway was one of the few on board wearing a seatbelt at the time, an inquest has heard.\nJessica Baker, 15, from Chester, was on her way to West Kirby Grammar School in Wirral on Merseyside, when the coach crashed on the northbound side of the M53 just after 08:00 BST on 29 September.\nThe inquest in Liverpool heard driver Stephen Shrimpton, 40, who also died, was suffering heart disease which caused him to collapse at the wheel.\nThe coroner said Jessica's post-mortem examination showed bruising consistent with wearing a seatbelt.\nAndre Rebello, senior coroner for Liverpool and Wirral, said CCTV showed many on the bus were \"unrestrained\" but Jessica appeared to be sitting in place, \"not moving in the same way everyone else is moving\".\nMr Rebello said: \"It would be my ruling it is more likely than not that Jessica was wearing a seatbelt at the time of this collision.\"\nAbout 50 students, travelling to West Kirby and Calday Grange grammar schools, were on the coach at the time of the crash.\nThe inquest heard CCTV showed Mr Shrimpton, who was not wearing a seatbelt, slump to his left-hand side before the vehicle left the motorway, went up an embankment, hit a tree and rolled back on to the hard shoulder.\nMr Rebello said a post-mortem examination showed the driver had extensive ischemic heart disease which could have caused an abrupt collapse and sudden death.\nThe court heard the test results could explain symptoms of chest and arm pain which he had described the evening before the collision, but it was not clear whether he had symptoms that morning.\nMr Rebello said no inquest was held into Mr Shrimpton's death as it was due to natural causes.\nIn a statement released after the crash, Mr Shrimpton's family said he was a \"loving husband and father to his wife and his wonderful children, a caring and thoughtful man who would always prioritise others over himself\".\nJessica's cause of death was a head injury and Mr Rebello recorded a conclusion of road traffic collision.\nJessica's parents nurses Sean Baker and Sarah Merrington, were in court for the hearing, with Mr Rebello telling the family: \"I know she was very much loved.\"\nHer family previously paid tribute to the talented climber, who they described as a \"warm-hearted, wonderful daughter, granddaughter and niece, devoted sister and loyal friend\".\nA fundraiser was launched to have a climbing wall built in her memory.\nAfter the crash, four other children were taken to hospital, including a 14-year-old boy whose injuries were said to be \"life-changing\", according to Merseyside Police.\nOthers were handled at an emergency training centre, with 13 treated for minor injuries before they were released.\nAfter the inquest was opened in October, Mr Rebello issued a prevention of future deaths report which raised concerns about the use of seatbelts as CCTV did not show they were being used.\nIn the report, which was sent to the Secretary of State for Transport and the Secretary of State for Education, Mr Rebello said: \"A distinction should be drawn between school buses in built-up areas and school commuter coaches travelling a distance using A roads and the motorway network - with regard to the availability and use of seatbelts.\"\nLawyers for the coach company, Carvers Coaches, and a child who was seriously injured in the collision attended the inquest, along with a lawyer representing Jessica's family.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "An American businessman who unsuccessfully tried to buy Derby County Football Club has been jailed for an unrelated fraud.\nChris Kirchner, 37, was sentenced on Thursday to 20 years in a US federal prison.\nA court in Texas heard the logistics entrepreneur spent millions of dollars of investors' money on luxury items for himself, including a private jet.\nHe scrapped a bid to buy the Rams out of administration in June 2022 after the funds needed failed to clear.\nKirchner founded logistics software company Slync in 2017 and was its chief executive until he was sacked by the firm's board of directors in 2022.\nIn February 2023 he was charged with fraud and in January this year was convicted by a jury of four counts of wire fraud and seven counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from unlawful activity.\nUS District Judge Mark Pittman sentenced Kirchner to 20 years in prison and ordered him to pay more than \u00a350m ($65m) in compensation.\nThe court in Fort Worth, Texas, heard between 2020 and 2022 - including while he was trying to buy the Rams - Kirchner fraudulently raised more than \u00a355m ($71m) from investors in Slync.\nHe made numerous false representations and promises about the firm's current level of business and predicted future income.\nKirchner then misappropriated over $25m (\u00a319m) of the funds to buy a $16m (\u00a312.35m) private jet, Rolls-Royce and Mercedes super cars, plus luxury watches and jewellery.\nBetween April 2020 and March 2022 Kirchner initiated nearly 100 transfers to move money from one of Slync\u2019s bank accounts into another only he had access to.\nHe also wired $20m (\u00a315m) directly into his personal account.\nUS Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, Leigha Simonton, said: \"Even as his company was circling the drain, Chris Kirchner was spending millions of his investors\u2019 money on himself.\n\"Apparently, projecting personal prosperity was more important to him than making payroll.\u201d\nWhen Slync struggled to pay staff in spring 2022, he attempted to replace some of the money by convincing at least four investors to wire $850k (\u00a3655k) as an added cash injection.\nBut the firm's board of directors had never authorised any fresh fundraising.\nThe court heard Kirchner offered various explanations for Slync\u2019s payroll issues \u2013 all of which were untrue.\nHe also fired an employee who reported to the directors that Kirchner may have falsely exaggerated Slync\u2019s financial performance to investors.\nAfter he was suspended in late July 2022, he removed IT administrator privileges from key Slync employees, preventing them from accessing the firm's computer systems.\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) inquiry found he then attempted to delete millions of pieces of Slync data, including emails.\nMs Simonton added: \u201cHis duplicity earned him 20 years in prison. \n\"We are proud to hold him accountable for his crimes and are committed to pursuing all business people engaged in criminal conduct.\u201d\nIn April 2022 Kirchner was appointed \"preferred bidder\" to buy Derby County after it had earlier been placed in administration by previous owner Mel Morris.\nThe new Labour MP for Derby North, Catherine Atkinson, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the case highlighted the need for a football regulator.\nShe said: \"The days of people like Chris Kirchner believing they have a home in the EFL [English Football League] are numbered.\n\"The government will protect our clubs, creating a football regulator to ensure they are run responsibly and treated as genuine community assets.\"\nThe new Labour MP for High Peak, Jon Pearce - a Derby County fan - made a similar point in a post on X.\nHe said: \"There is no clearer example of the urgent need for better governance of football in this country and to protect football clubs.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or Instagram.

    "Lower carbon emissions were recorded in 2022, according to the latest government figures.\nIn Bristol, 1.57m tonnes of greenhouse gases were emitted, down 7.5% from 2021. \nIt is believed that warmer temperatures and higher bills prompted people to use less energy. \nThe new data from the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero will help council bosses focus their efforts on reaching net zero in the city. \nChanging how the city heats homes will be a key area of focus over the next few years with planned expansions to district heat networks, grants for heat pumps and upgrades to insulation, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. \nEmissions from industry and the commercial sector have fallen the most while transport emissions have barely reduced over the same period.\nThey fell slightly in 2022 by less than 1% after previously rising between 2020 and 2021 following the lifting of lockdown restrictions. \nThe latest figures will barely take into account the effect of the Clean Air Zone which launched in November 2022. \nHowever, this was introduced to reduce nitrogen dioxide, rather than carbon dioxide. \nMany cars - particularly hybrid, electric and modern petrol vehicles - are compliant with the zone. \nNitrogen dioxide directly harms human health while carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas causing climate change. \nClimate change is the long-term shift in the Earth's average temperatures and weather conditions.\nOver the past decade, the world was on average about 1.2C warmer than during the late 19th Century.\nIt has now been confirmed that global warming exceeded 1.5C across the 12-month period between February 2023 and January 2024. \nThat followed 2023 being declared the warmest year on record.\nThe temperature increase was driven by human-caused climate change and boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon.\nThe UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning the country will take as much of these planet-warming gases - such as carbon dioxide - out of the atmosphere as it puts in. \nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Former Conservative MP Sir Michael Fabricant said he understood why his party did not inspire confidence with voters in the general election.\nSir Michael failed to be re-elected as MP for Lichfield where he had been an MP since 1992, losing to Labour's Dave Robertson by 810 votes.\nIn an interview after his tenure as an MP ended, Fabricant said party infighting and a quick succession of prime ministers over the last few years had not inspired confidence with the electorate.\n\"I'm obviously disappointed but I suspected it might happen,\" the 74-year-old told the BBC.\n\"Firstly, there were huge national swings [that] worked against Conservative candidates. I mean, I don't want to make excuses, but I will.\"\nSir Michael lost a 30% share in the vote compared to 2019 when he won with a majority of more than 22,000.\nHe claimed tactical voting was another reason for his loss, citing the performance of Reform UK during the election.\nOverall, his party suffered a huge general election defeat - the worst in its parliamentary history\n\"All governments in power are unpopular because of the cost of fuel and inflation and everything caused by the money spent on Covid, furlough, and also because of the war in Ukraine,\" he added.\n\"Of course the Conservative Party hasn't helped itself by constantly fighting amongst itself over the last few years, and the succession of prime ministers didn't inspire confidence with the electorate, so I understand why they felt that way. \n\"So I like to think it's not a personal referendum on my performance as an MP but rather the failure I think of the last few years of the Conservative government.\"\nHowever the former MP was gracious in defeat, calling Dave Robertson a \"decent guy\" who he was sure would do his best to represent the constituency.\n\"Because I want him to do well, for the people of the constituency who've elected me all over these years, I wish him well,\" Sir Michael said.\nSir Michael was MP for the area since 1992 when he represented Mid Staffordshire before it was abolished under a boundary review and he became the MP for Lichfield in 1997.\nKnown for his trademark blond locks, the subject of much speculation, as an MP he was known for his colourful personality and fondness for eye-catching stunts.\nThey included once filming himself cycling naked around a park in London, to promote the creation of a charity naked bike ride in Lichfield.\nIn 2022, he apologised for suggesting teachers and nurses enjoyed a \"quiet drink\" in staff rooms during lockdown.\nSir Michael made the comment during a BBC interview where he said he did not believe then prime minister Boris Johnson knew he was breaking the law when he attended a gathering in Downing Street in June 2020 to celebrate his 56th birthday.\nHe was given a knighthood in the former prime minister's resignation honours list.\nReflecting on the highlights of his career, Sir Michael said he was proud to have helped save the National Memorial Arboretum when it had financial difficulties.\nHe recounted, while he was in opposition, persuading a Labour minister to write off a huge debt in VAT which he said would have bankrupted them.\nSir Michael also said he was proud to have persuaded the RAF to take on a young female constituent whose father had a hereditary disease.\nDespite having lost his seat, he said he would not be leaving the area: \"I hope Lichfield people will remember me with affection.\"\nLooking to the future, the former MP added: \"Someone has suggested I do Strictly Come Dancing but I'm not too sure!\"\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge after the US found the company violated a deal meant to reform it after two fatal crashes by its 737 Max planes that killed 346 passengers and crew.\nThe Department of Justice (DoJ) said the plane-maker had also agreed to pay a criminal fine of $243.6m (\u00a3190m).\nHowever, the families of the people who died on the flights five years ago have criticised it as a \"sweetheart deal\" that would allow Boeing to avoid full responsibility for the deaths. One called it an \"atrocious abomination\".\nThe settlement must now be approved by a US judge.\nBy pleading guilty, Boeing will avoid the spectacle of a criminal trial - something that victims' families have been pressing for.\nThe company has been in crisis over its safety record since two near-identical crashes involving 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019. It led to the global grounding of the plane for more than a year.\nIn 2021, prosecutors charged Boeing with one count of conspiracy to defraud regulators, alleging it had deceived the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about its MCAS flight control system, which was implicated in both crashes.\nIt agreed not to prosecute Boeing if the company paid a penalty and successfully completed a three-year period of increased monitoring and reporting.\nBut in January, shortly before that period was due to end, a door panel in a Boeing plane operated by Alaska Airlines blew out soon after take-off and forced the jet to land.\nNo-one was injured during the incident but it intensified scrutiny over how much progress Boeing had made on improving its safety and quality record.   \nIn May, the DoJ said it had found Boeing had violated the terms of the agreement, opening up the possibility of prosecution. \nBoeing's decision to plead guilty is still a significant black mark for the firm because it means that the company - which is a prominent military contractor for the US government - now has a criminal record. It is also one of the world's two biggest manufacturers of commercial jets. \nIt is not immediately clear how the criminal record will affect the firm's contracting business. The government typically bars or suspends firms with records from participating in bids, but can grant waivers. \n\nPaul Cassell, a lawyer representing some of the families of people killed on the 2018 and 2019 flights, said: \"This sweetheart deal fails to recognise that because of Boeing\u2019s conspiracy, 346 people died.\n\"Through crafty lawyering between Boeing and DoJ, the deadly consequences of Boeing\u2019s crime are being hidden.\"\nHe called on the judge assessing the deal to \"reject this inappropriate plea and simply set the matter for a public trial, so that all the facts surrounding the case will be aired in a fair and open forum before a jury\u201d.\nIn a letter to the government in June, Mr Cassell had urged the DoJ to fine Boeing more than $24bn.\nZipporah Kuria who lost her father Joseph in one of the fatal crashes, said the plea was an \"atrocious abomination\".\n\"Miscarriage of justice is a gross understatement in describing this,\" she said. \"I hope that, God forbid, if this happens again the DoJ is reminded that it had the opportunity to do something meaningful and instead chose not to.\"\nEd Pierson, executive director of Foundation for Aviation Safety and a former senior manager at Boeing, said the plea was \"seriously disappointing\" and \"a terrible deal for justice\".\n\"Instead of holding individuals accountable, they\u2019re just basically giving them another get out of jail free card,\u201d he said.\nThe DoJ said the deal did not grant immunity to individuals and only addressed corporate actions that occurred before the 737 Max crashes.\nA Boeing 737 Max plane operated by Indonesia's Lion Air crashed in late October 2018 shortly after take-off, killing all 189 people on board. Just months later, an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing all 157 passengers and crew.\nIn the 2021 deal, Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5bn to resolve the matter, including a $243m criminal penalty and $500m to a victims' fund.\nThe deal outraged family members, who were not consulted on the terms and have called for the company to stand trial.\nSenior staff at the DoJ recommended in favour of prosecution, CBS News, the BBC's US news partner reported in late June. \nAt a hearing in June, Senator Richard Blumenthal said he believed there was \"near overwhelming evidence\" that prosecution should be pursued.\nLawyers for family members said the DoJ was worried it did not have a strong case against the firm.\nMark Forkner, a former Boeing technical pilot who was the only person to face criminal charges arising from the incident, was acquitted by a jury in 2022. His lawyers had argued he was being used as a scapegoat. \nMark Cohen, a professor emeritus at Vanderbilt University, who has studied corporate punishments, said prosecutors often prefer plea deals or deferred prosecution agreements, which allow them to avoid the risk of a trial and ca",
    "T-shirts branded with the names of Scottish councils have become an unlikely fashion hit in Japan.\nLocal authorities including Falkirk, Clackmannanshire, North Lanarkshire and West Lothian feature in a range launched by Tokyo-based brand Shoo-La-Rue.\nImages of the clothing, part of the \"Cutie Blonde\" collection, have gone viral on social media.\nThe brand, owned by fashion company World, describes the T-shirts as having a \"fun\" pattern and recommends wearing them with \"voluminous wide pants\".\nFreelance football coach David Clements joked he had to do a double take when he spotted one of the T-shirts - on sale from 1,489 yen (\u00a37.20) - in a shopping mall.\nMr Clements, who is originally from Glasgow, has lived between the city and Saiki in the Oita region after meeting wife Nozoki 14 years ago.\nHe said it was \"extremely unusual\" to see any influence from the UK in the region, on the island of Kyushu.\nMr Clements told BBC Scotland News: \"I have been coming here since 2010 and I have barely met another person from the UK, let alone seen Falkirk on a T-shirt.\n\"I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw it. It was on their promotional rail, so it is obviously something they are proud of.\n\"I think even if you saw someone walking about one of the really fashionable areas of Tokyo, you would be confused by it.\"\nMr Clements, 39, said it was not uncommon for Japanese brands to plaster Western words or locations on their clothing without it being checked by a native speaker.\nIt could explain the seemingly random dates on some items.\nThe Clackmannanshire T-shirt includes the slogan \"clarity precedes success\" underneath a Mediterranean scene.\nMeanwhile, the Falkirk design wrongly suggests the town is in West Lothian.\nBut Mr Clements said mis-transliterations work both ways \u2013 including on brands popular in the UK.\n\"When we go back to Glasgow, to Braehead, my wife laughs when we go past some of the shops,\" he said.\n\"Brands like Superdry will have their T-shirts with Japanese lettering on them. But they are just complete nonsense. \n\"My wife pointed out the first time that they have taken random letters of the kanji and put them on a T-shirt, but it means nothing.\u201d\nSo will it start a trend? Will the fashion conscious in Kyoto be wearing Kilmarnock? Will Oban make it big in Osaka? Will Stirling catch on in Sapporo?\nIt is hard to say.

    "A motion calling for a ceasefire in Gaza turned into a heated debate with councillors in Bradford trading insults.\nCouncillors heckled each other during the meeting on Tuesday, with one member saying he was \"horrified by the conduct shown\".\nPut forward by council leader Susan Hinchcliffe, the motion called for Bradford Council to \u201ccondemn the indiscriminate attacks on Gaza by the Israeli military\u201d and also called for the release of all hostages.\nThe subsequent debate soon became fiery with a clash between Labour and Independent councillors.\nThe motion, which was voted through by the Labour-run administration, is the third one made regarding the conflict.\nIt is also the first since the local elections in May when a number of Labour candidates lost their seats to Independents who had made the Gaza issue a key part of their campaign.\nBefore being voted in as prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer had previously called for Israel to comply with international law in the conflict, but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.\nConservative councillor Mike Pollard said it was \u201cdepressing\u201d to see the debate had become an \u201coutbreak of strife between the Labour group and the Independents, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. \nHe said the motion was \u201canother iteration of a futile motion\u201d and\u00a0questioned what impact the debate in the Bradford Council chamber would have on affairs in the Middle East.\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the message loud and clear, as has, I\u2019m sure, the newly elected government. \n\"If a variation of this motion comes back before the council in the next six months, the Conservative group is minded to disengage from that part of a future agenda, not only by abstaining on the vote but by also vacating the chamber for the duration of the debate.\u201d\nAt the end of the hour-long debate, councillor Matt Edwards, leader of the Greens in Bradford, said: \u201cAs a Bradford councillor I am horrified by the conduct shown tonight.\n\u201cThis is meant to be a debate on peace in the Middle East, but tonight we\u2019ve heard more about the ballot boxes than the suffering in Palestine. \n\"It is political point-scoring when people are suffering and dying.\u201d\nHe said councillors from all political colours, and from all across Bradford, had spoken out against the atrocities in Gaza.\nHe added: \u201cThe heckling, shouting and baying we\u2019ve seen today does nothing for the people of Palestine.\u201d\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Pub giant Marston's has left the brewing industry after agreeing to sell its 40% stake in a brewing company for \u00a3206m.\nThe firm announced on Monday that it sold its stake in Carlsberg Marston\u2019s Brewing Company (CMBC), a joint venture valued at \u00a3780m, to Carlsberg.\nIt ends almost 200 years of brewing heritage, which began with Banks and Company at the Park Brewery in Wolverhampton in 1875.\nChief executive officer of Marston's Justin Platt said the sale to the Danish brewing company \"significantly reduced\" Marston's debt.\nThe group will now focus on running about 1,370 pubs, which it operates across England, Scotland, and Wales.\nMarston's and Carlsberg announced a merger in May 2020 to form CMBC, in a move which involved Marston's six breweries and distribution depots, but not its pubs.\nHowever, Marston\u2019s said it would continue its \"strong partnership\" with CMBC through the long-term brand distribution agreement which remains in place.\nOn the same day, Carlsberg announced it had bought Britvic, the company which makes drinks such as Robinsons squash and J20, for \u00a33.3bn.\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"It\u2019s rare to see a business do two deals in one day, but sometimes the stars simply align.\n\"The concurrent decision to buy Marston\u2019s out of the pair\u2019s brewing joint venture suggests beer remains a big part of Carlsberg\u2019s ongoing story.\"\nMr Platt said the sale was \"a significant milestone\" for the company.\nMr Platt said: \"In my first six months with the business, it has become very clear to me that our core capability and key opportunity to unlock value for shareholders is in driving a focused and successful pub business.\n\"This deal further strengthens our balance sheet, significantly reducing our debt by over \u00a3200m.\n\"Crucially, it allows us to become a pure play hospitality business and focus on what we do best \u2013 namely, giving our guests amazing pub experiences.\"\nFollow BBC Wolverhampton & Black Country on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Leaders of a school where two pupils died after a Land Rover crashed into an end-of-term tea party say they feel let down by the Metropolitan Police\u2019s investigation.\nLast week, prosecutors decided the driver of the car that killed eight-year-olds Nuria Sajjad and Selena Lau would not be prosecuted as she had suffered an epileptic seizure.\nThe Met has now launched a review of its investigation into the crash at The Study Preparatory School in Wimbledon, south-west London.\nIn their first interviews since the pupils were killed, the current and former headteacher, who was in charge at the time of the crash, have told BBC News the Met has failed to answer some of their key questions about the incident.\nThey say they are \u201cangry, sad and confused\u201d by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision not to prosecute.\nCurrent head Sharon Maher said they had to wait nearly a year for the decision, which came just 10 days before the anniversary of the girls\u2019 deaths.\n\u201cWe were both very surprised [by the CPS decision],\u201d Ms Maher said.\nThe Met said its officers had worked tirelessly through every detail of the incident to ensure a complete investigation but Ms Maher questioned that. \n\u201cIt didn\u2019t look that way to us,\u201c she said.\nFormer headteacher Helen Lowe added: \u201cNo, I think the words \u2018thorough\u2019 and \u2018tireless\u2019 suggest that you would have a body of evidence that you would be able to share\u2026 but in some areas there was just a complete lack of knowledge, of basic information.\u201d\nMs Lowe said she was still trying to give the force the benefit of the doubt suggesting that its inability to answer questions from bereaved families, school parents and staff could be resolved.\n\u201cMaybe when they [the Met] go away and look at the evidence, they will remember the answers. But there were a number of occasions where they weren't sure if something had been done, or they couldn't remember.\u201d\n\u201cAt this moment in time, it would appear that I have been let down by them.\u201d\nAfter the CPS decision the girls' families said in a statement that \"justice has neither been done, nor has been seen to be done today\". They said they remained \"unconvinced\" that the investigation had been conducted thoroughly.\nSpeaking to BBC News, Ms Lowe vividly recalls the horror of the crash and was surprised the police didn\u2019t interview her as a witness.\n\u201cThere was terrible screaming from all the children who were terrified of course\u2026 I ran out and there was a scene of complete chaos and mayhem. The car was so big it felt like it was a big lorry,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI immediately saw Nuria obviously very badly injured, and her mummy next to her... I just stayed with her until the ambulance came. And I just talked to her about how wonderful she was, how much we loved her and how much mummy and daddy loved her and what a special girl she was.\u201d\nShe said Nuria was a talented, cheeky and very chatty girl, who was proud when her friends did well.

    "A coroner has called for improved driver training for US government staff in the UK following the death of Harry Dunn. \nThe motorcyclist was killed in a collision with a car driven by American Anne Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton near Brackley in August 2019.\nThe Northamptonshire coroner, Anne Pember, has also written to the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) over ambulance delays.\nThe US embassy said it was committed to ensuring all personnel posted to the UK drove in a \"safe and responsible\" manner.\nThe BBC has seen a number of Prevention of Future Death (PFD) reports which have been issued following an inquest held last month into Mr Dunn's death.\nMrs Pember highlighted conflicting evidence about the driver training given to American personnel following the collision on the B4031.\nThe US embassy told the inquest that new arrivals were briefed on the dangers of driving on the wrong side of the road.\nBut Mrs Pember said subsequent evidence contradicted this.\nShe has written to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) informing them of the need to take action. \nThe inquest also heard about a delay in a road ambulance reaching the 19-year-old. \nThe coroner sent another PFD report to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) highlighting the need to meet response time standards and tackle  handover delays, which often cause ambulances to be stuck outside A&E.\nMrs Pember also issued a third report, calling for paramedics to be able to carry stronger pain relief to help patients in a similar situation.\nThe government departments concerned have 56 days to respond to her. \nMr Dunn was killed on 27 August 2019, when Mrs Sacoolas' car struck his motorcycle moments after she left the Northamptonshire base.\nShe was driving on the right side of the road, the standard in America, when she should have been on the left.\nSacoolas had diplomatic immunity asserted on her behalf by the US government following the crash, because her husband Jonathan worked for US intelligence.\nThe couple then left the UK and it later emerged she was also an intelligence operative.\nShe was eventually sentenced, via video link in December 2022, to eight months' in prison, suspended for a year, for causing death by careless driving.\nIn a new statement, Mr Dunn's family expressed their satisfaction at the PFD reports. \n\"The family were always determined to ensure that Harry\u2019s death was not in vain and that part of his legacy would be that no family should suffer the way they suffered and that all lessons that needed to be learned,\" they said.  \nThey added: \"Despite the UK FCDO saying publicly that lessons had been learned in respect of road safety and that they were taking steps to ensure that the US did address the issue once and for all, it became clear in evidence at the inquest that that was not in fact the case.\"  \nThe US Embassy offered its condolences to the Dunn family. \nIt told the BBC: \"US military and diplomatic personnel and family members are required to respect the laws of the host country.  \n\"That responsibility includes observing laws related to operating motor vehicles safely. \n\"The US Embassy is committed to ensuring that all US personnel posted to the UK drive in a manner that is safe and responsible\".\nAn FCDO spokesman said: \"We pay tribute to the incredible resolve of Harry\u2019s family and thank the coroner for her report. \n\"This government will consider her recommendations and will respond.\n\"We are committed to ensuring lessons are properly learnt. Our thoughts remain with Harry Dunn's family, friends and loved ones.\"\nThe DHSC said: \"Our sympathies are with Harry Dunn\u2019s friends and family in this tragic case, and it is important that we learn from every prevention of future deaths report.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Daisy Edgar-Jones, who starred as Marianne in hit TV series Normal People, has said she would like to revisit the role in the future.\n\"I love those characters,\" the British actress, 26, tells BBC News. \"It would be wonderful to explore them again.\"\nBased on Sally Rooney's novel, the BBC Three drama charted the on-off relationship of teenagers Marianne and Connell, played by Paul Mescal.\nReleased in April 2020 at the height of the pandemic, it propelled its young leads to fame. Both are now starring in major new films, Edgar-Jones in Twisters and Mescal in Gladiator II.\n\"Normal People was a series that was such a lockdown phenomenon,\" Edgar-Jones says.\n\"I think it introduced Paul and I to a lot of people and film-makers,\" she says, adding that she felt \"really lucky\" for the opportunities it opened up.\nI meet Edgar-Jones in a central London hotel, where she is doing press interviews for her new film.\nThis round of promotion is very different from her experience during the pandemic, when she was \"on Zoom for months on end\".\n\"I haven't done that many in-person interviews yet,\" she says. \"It's so nice.\"\nSince Normal People, Edgar-Jones has starred in films like Fresh and Where the Crawdads Sing, true crime mini-series Under the Banner of Heaven, and now Twisters.\nFor a lot of fans, she remains firmly in their minds as the smart and unafraid schoolgirl Marianne, whose relationship with Connell transfixed viewers.\nA few months ago, Edgar-Jones and Mescal almost broke the internet with an Instagram post that appeared to tease a Normal People sequel.\nThe pair later clarified that, in fact, they were reuniting to host a marathon screening of Normal People for charity.\nBut Edgar-Jones indicates that she hasn't shut the door on it yet.\n\"If [Rooney] is up for writing a new story, who knows,\" she says.\nSo is she open to the idea? She laughs. \"Keeping it open. Always open.\"\nHaving shot to prominence during Covid, Edgar-Jones says fame is only now \"starting to feel real\".\n\"I can't believe I'm in a film of this scale,\" she says of Twisters. \"It's definitely a pinch yourself moment.\"\nIn the film, a sequel to 1996 blockbuster Twister, Edgar-Jones plays Katie Cooper, a retired storm chaser who returns to the open plains in central Oklahoma to test a new tracking system.\nEdgar-Jones notes that Cooper, who is haunted by a tragic past encounter with a tornado, bears similarities to other characters she has played.\n\"I think my characters tend to be, and have been historically, quite introspective. Or characters who have a complex inner life, who are dealing with things that are heavy and emotional,\" she says.\nShe relates to those roles, but adds that she has \"a bit more craic\" than her characters.\n\"I think maybe I'm more light-hearted. I'm quite silly.\"\nThat said, this film did allow her to have some fun, including running and screaming across fields.\n\"I did do a lot of running. Which isn't my strong suit,\" she says.\n\"I've actually got a bit of a weird run, which I've been told, so I actually just tried to practice not looking like an eejit as I was running. That was the main thing.\"\nShe also ate a lot of Oklahoma cuisine on set, possibly offsetting all the exercise she was getting.\n\"I had something called chicken fried steak, which I'd never had, which is steak - actual steak - which they fry in chicken batter, which was cool\".\nEdgar-Jones stars opposite US actor Glen Powell as Tyler Owens, a social media superstar who shamelessly chases tornadoes for likes.\nPowell, who has also starred in Top Gun: Maverick, Anyone But You and Hit Man, is seen by many as Hollywood's latest heartthrob.\n\"I feel like I have a habit of starring with a lot of the men of the moment,\" Edgar-Jones says.\n\"I've worked with a lot of really brilliant actors who have buzz around them too,\" she says. She describes Powell as \"magical\", and adds that Mescal is \"one of my all time best friends\".\nThe Normal People co-stars were recently seen together at Glastonbury festival, in pictures posted on social media.\n\"We had the best time. Glastonbury is maybe one of my favourite places on Earth when the festival's on,\" Edgar-Jones says.\n\"It's so much fun. I love dancing, I love being with all my friends, I love camping, I love it all. So yeah. We had such a blast.\"\nTwisters has received mixed reviews from critics. The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey awarded it four stars, praising it as a \"comfortingly old school affair\" and calling its leads \"charismatic\".\nMeanwhile, writing in Variety, Owen Gleiberman described it as \"less awesome than the original\".\nThe Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave it three stars, calling it a \"fun film with some big set-piece scenes\" but adding it was \"weirdly coy\" about mentioning climate change.\nEdgar-Jones, for her part, says climate change was definitely a theme in the film.\n\"There's an element of climate change and what that means for how tornado alley is expanding and how more frequently we're getting extreme weather events,\" she says.\n\"And",
    "Thousands more ex-servicemen and women will receive compensation for hearing loss suffered during training or combat, the BBC has learned.\nMilitary personnel are repeatedly exposed to loud noises, such as gunfire and bombing, during their careers.\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) has opposed many claims made by veterans experiencing hearing loss, arguing other sources of noise were to blame, individuals should have worn protection or their claims were too late.\nNow it has accepted exposure to noise in the military has been a cause of hearing loss and that people discharged after 1987 could be eligible for compensation.\nThe MoD has been approached for comment.\nBetween 2012 and 2020, the MoD paid \u00a372m in compensation for military hearing loss, settling more than 9,000 cases.\nBut it is likely this new court agreement will result in many more service people receiving payments, with up to 10,000 currently making claims.\nSimon Ellis, from Hugh James solicitors, who is representing nearly 5,000 military personnel, called the development \"ground-breaking\". His firm expects many more claimants to come forward.\n\"[Veterans] have had their careers prematurely ended, other employment opportunities denied to them, and their personal lives irrevocably changed,\" he said.\n\"People who put their lives on the line in the service of our country should expect that they are not put in additional unnecessary danger by their employer.\"\nIn a case last year which paved the way for the new scheme, James Barry, who is in his 30s, was awarded \u00a3700,000 after developing hearing loss and tinnitus.\nThe MoD accepted it had a \"duty of care\" to veterans and abandoned its argument that claims should have been brought sooner.\nBarney Barnett, a 44-year-old ex-commando who joined the Royal Marines aged 16, also suffers from tinnitus and finds it hard to understand people when there is background noise. \n\"It affects me every day, I tend not to moan about it, I just get on with it,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Barnett served in Iraq and Afghanistan where he went on patrols from forward operating bases and was repeatedly involved in combat, sometimes as a sniper team commander.\nHe told the BBC he had fired or been attacked with weapons including rifles, grenades, general purpose machine guns, light machine guns, 50 calibre machine guns, anti-tank missiles, mortars, and bombs.\nVideos he shared from conflicts abroad capture the roar of armoured vehicles or helicopters landing, punctured by constant gunfire.\nIn one picture he can be seen wearing small earplugs, but he said that was a rare occurrence. He says he was either not given hearing protection or he was not able to wear it for operational reasons.\n\u201cIf you get engaged by the enemy, whether that's an IED, whether that's indirect fire, whether it's a burst of automatic fire, the last thing you have time to do is think about your hearing,\" he said.\n\"Your main concern is those on the ground with you. Staying alive.\"\nIn 2014, Mr Barnett went before a military board and it was decided he was medically unfit to continue in the Royal Marines because of noise-induced hearing loss.\nHe struggled to find work in civilian life and served with MI5. Later an online assessment for the security service deemed him unsuitable due to his poor hearing.\nHe is now an operations director in a security firm but must avoid loud environments such as concerts.\nMr Barnett's attempts to claim compensation began seven years ago and he hopes the new legal agreement with the MoD means it will now be resolved quickly.\nHe says compensation would help him buy more advanced hearing aids and allow his life to move forward.\n\"People don't see what we\u2019ve been through,\" he said.\n\"We've done our battling, we've been on operations, we've come home.\n\"The government speeding this whole process up, as opposed to battling it out in court, will mean the world to people.\"\nThe military introduced hearing protection in the 1970s but Nicholas Hill, an acoustics engineer who has given evidence in many cases, says it was difficult for soldiers to wear all the time.\nHe said \"every firearm ever made, if you fire it with unprotected ears, just once, can damage hearing\".\nA handful of cases will go to trial next year, to determine the level of compensation veterans should receive.\nHugh James solicitors said after this is decided, any claimants will be able to resolve their cases without the need to go to court, if they can show their hearing loss resulted from service in the military.\nThey must have served at some point after 1987 when a change in the law suspended legal immunity for the government in cases involving service personnel.\nThe MoD agreement follows negotiations led by Hugh James solicitors and allows the government to continue fighting cases brought by other law firms, although sources close to the case believe this is unlikely to happen.\nThe agreement was reached at the High Court on Monday and lawyers said it would not change with the incoming Labour g",
    "A heritage group has criticised plans for the redevelopment of an historic former brewery site in Leeds.\nLeeds Civic Trust said proposals to remove original features from the former Tetley Brewery building were \"entirely inappropriate\".\nDeveloper Vastint said it valued the trust's opinion and would work \"collaboratively\" to \"allay any concerns\".\nLeeds City Council is expected to decide on the plans later this year.\nThe plans, which were unveiled in April, would see a one-story extension on the side of the main Tetley building demolished, with the original building refurbished and a new extension built.\nLeeds Civic Trust director Martin Hamilton said the application's proposals to remove original features, including wooden panelling, doors and fireplaces, were \"entirely inappropriate\".\nHe added: \u201cThe proposed two-storey extension, which replaces the existing one-storey structure, which is believed to have been built at the same time as the original building, will dominate the existing building in a way that we cannot accept.\u201d\nThe Trust, which \"promotes the improvements of Leeds in the spheres of planning, architecture, heritage, and city amenities\", has objected to the current proposals.\nMr Hamilton said the organisation was \"not anti-development\" and admitted the building \"requires an upgrade\".\nHowever, \"it should be possible to retain the heart and soul of the last remaining remnant of the site\u2019s brewing past\", he added.\nHe called for \"a sensitive and minimalist approach\" to the building's redevelopment.\nThe brewery was the home of Tetley's beer-making in Leeds for nearly 200 years.\nIt closed in 2011 and was used as an art gallery until its closure in December.\nIn March, Kirkstall Brewery announced it would take on the lease of the building, which is not listed.\nAccording to a heritage statement accompanying the application, the site has a \"low heritage value\".\nIt said the current proposals \"strive to retain the most significant, principal elevations and architectural features\".\nDeveloper Vastint UK said it valued the opinion of the trust.\n\"We look forward to working collaboratively with Leeds Civic Trust and other key stakeholders to allay any concerns as we take our proposals for The Tetley forward,\" a spokesperson added.\nThere had been \"significant research\" carried out ahead of the plans being submitted with internal features being retained and the external design was \"sympathetic\" to the area, they said.\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter)\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

    "Donald Trump's 11 July sentencing in his hush money case may be delayed after his lawyers asked the judge to set aside his conviction in the wake of Supreme Court's immunity ruling.\nIn a letter to Justice Juan Merchan, Manhattan prosecutors said that while they believed Trump's motion to overturn his conviction to be \"without merit\", they did not object to his request to delay the sentencing. \nThe Supreme Court on Monday ruled that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official actions\" they take while in office.\nIn May, Trump's conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records was based in part on evidence of meetings and communications that occurred while he was president.\nA letter sent by Trump's lawyers to the judge cites Monday's ruling that granted the former president immunity from prosecution for \"official actions\" he took while in office.\nManhattan prosecutors have asked that the judge respond to Trump's motion by 24 July. \nJudge Merchan must now rule on whether to formally adjourn the sentencing.\nTrump's team points out that the former president signed off on the records in the hush money case while in office in 2017, but one lawyer suggested this was unlikely to be considered an official act.\nHis lawyers also argued that during his Manhattan trial, prosecutors shared \"highly prejudicial\" evidence that should have never been presented to the jury because it was from during his time in the White House, including Trump's 2017 social media posts and testimony about events in the Oval Office. \n\"The verdicts in this case violate the presidential immunity doctrine and create grave risks of 'an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself,'\" Trump's lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in the letter to Justice Merchan. \nLast year, Trump's lawyers similarly argued that the allegations in the case involved that were within the scope of his official presidential duties. \nHowever, a federal judge wrote that Trump had failed to show that his conduct was \"for or relating to any act performed by or for the President under [scope] of the official acts of a president\".\nMonday's ruling by the Supreme Court was hailed by Trump as a \"big win\" for democracy. \nThe justices ruled that a president had immunity for \"official acts\" but was not immune for \"unofficial acts\".\nThat ruling related to a separate case against Trump: he is suspected of trying to illegally overturn the 2020 presidential election result that gave victory to Joe Biden.\nReacting to the Supreme Court ruling, President Biden described it as a \"dangerous precedent\" that undermined the \"rule of law\" in America.\n\nIn May, a panel of 12 Manhattan jurors unanimously convicted Trump on all counts of falsifying business records in the hush money case..\nDuring the trial, the court heard from a number of witnesses, including former adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose alleged sexual encounter with the former president was at the centre of the case.\nThe former president was accused of having concealed a payment to buy the silence of Ms Daniels in the final days of his 2016 election campaign.\nProsecutors had argued that, by approving a scheme to disguise the money as legal expenses, Trump broke election law.\nTrump called the verdict in the New York case a \"disgrace\".\nJustice Merchan would likely agree with a delay in the sentencing, but the Supreme Court decision is ultimately unlikely to affect Trump's conviction, said Mark Zauderer, prominent appellate attorney in New York.\n\"The allegations in the New York fraud case in which Trump was convicted seem clearly to relate to unofficial conduct by Trump, none of which would seem to involve his official duties,\" he told the BBC.\n\"While Trump will be able to litigate his immunity defence in some of his cases, he will have a most difficult time succeeding with this argument in the New York case.\"\nAdditional reporting by Kayla Epstein and Madeline Halpert in New York.\n",

Free again.\"\nHe calculated that Beaumont subjected him to being jabbed by a syringe more than 50 times.\nThe second male victim said Beaumont told him he needed to assess radiation in his body and was instructed to sign the Official Secrets Act.\nThe third student described Beaumont as very convincing, leading her to undress in front of him before being assaulted.\nJanice Green, defending, asked the judge to make the sentences run concurrently.\nShe said: \"There was no physical injury but psychological harm which is more connected to the breach of trust as the victims all believed for a long time that they were part of research.\n\"It wasn't until 2017 when matters were public that they became aware.\n\"They came forward in 2022 and it is not clear why that was.\n\"If these matters had been prosecuted along with the other offences, it is unlikely to have been a greater sentence than 13-and-a-half years.\"\nLord Mulholland told Beaumont that he carried out a \"gross breach of trust\" on his victims.\nThe judge said: \"You pled guilty to three very serious cases of indecent assaults perpetrated on three young impressionable students at the university where you were a student and a warden.\n\"You preyed on their experience and pretended to be employed by the Ministry of Defence to take samples to check for radiation levels after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\"\nHe said the samples were taken from intimate areas of the students' bodies.\n\"You are predatory and used your status and maturity to prey on them,\" the judge added.\n\"I don't think it is appropriate that the sentence runs concurrently as that will mean you won't be punished in any way other than denunciation for the offences you pled guilty to.\n\"I order that this runs consecutive to the sentence you are already subject to.\"\nBeaumont had latterly been working as a self-employed funeral celebrant for 17 years.",

    "A judge has ruled there is sufficient evidence for Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and his wife to face trial over historical sex offence charges.\nThe former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader, 61, has appeared at a preliminary enquiry hearing in Newry Magistrates' Court.\nHe is accused of 18 offences involving two alleged victims.\nThe ex-MP is charged with rape, plus four counts of gross indecency and 13 counts of indecent assault.\nHis wife, Lady Donaldson, 58, is a co-accused.\nShe faces five charges of aiding and abetting between 1987 and 2008 in connection with the alleged offences.\nHis offences are alleged to have happened between 1985 and 2008.\nBoth accused appeared in the dock during a three-minute hearing on Wednesday.\nIt was held to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to progress the case to crown court trial.\nDuring proceedings, both defendants were asked if they wished to say anything in respect of the charges.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson replied: \u201cNot at this stage.\u201d\nHis wife responded: \u201cNo.\" \nDistrict Judge Eamonn King said: \u201cI am satisfied, on the basis of the papers before the court, there is a prima facie case to answer.\u201d\nHe set the date of the next hearing for 10 September.\nBoth accused remain on bail.\nThe pair were arrested at their home on 28 March and charged after a day of questioning at Antrim police station.\nThey first appeared in court in April.\nSir Jeffrey stated he would be strenuously contesting the charges when he announced he was quitting as DUP leader.\nPhotographers were in position on ladders at the court entrance long before Sir Jeffrey and Lady Donaldson arrived this morning.\nTelevision camera crews and news reporters pressed against crush barriers looking for a perfect vantage point.\nDozens of police officers wearing high visibility jackets were positioned beside the steel barriers erected along both sides of the busy main road outside the courthouse.\nThe two defendants arrived separately, between 09:30 BST and 10:00.\nSir Jeffrey was first to arrive, followed a short time later by Lady Donaldson.\nA handful of bystanders watched from across the road as they walked in turn between the barriers and through the front door of the courthouse.\nShortly after 11:00, they walked back out of court, once more to the sound of clicking cameras, and news reporters watching every step as they made their way, minutes apart, to a waiting car.\nSir Jeffrey Donaldson was elected leader of the DUP in 2021.\nHe was Northern Ireland's longest-serving MP, having been first elected to Parliament in 1997 as a representative of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP)\nHe first entered politics when he worked for MP Enoch Powell between 1982 and 1984 after joining the UUP.\nSir Jeffrey's own career in front-line politics began in 1985 when he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as its youngest member.\nIn 2003, he left the UUP to join the DUP due to his long-standing opposition to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the leadership of David Trimble.\nSir Jeffrey recently steered the DUP back into government in Northern Ireland ending a two-year boycott of the devolved institutions.\nHe was knighted in 2016 for political service.\nHe married his wife Eleanor in 1987.",
    "Shortly after the Supreme Court issued its decision on his claim of presidential immunity, Donald Trump took to social media to celebrate.\n\u201cBig win for our constitution and democracy,\u201d he posted on Truth Social. \"Proud to be an American!\u201d\nWhile Trump did not get the sweeping protections that he and his lawyers had sought, he got more than enough to achieve his immediate objective of delaying another trial until after November's election.\nThe ruling from the six conservative justices dealt a serious blow to the federal criminal case against him on charges of attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\nSpecial Prosecutor Jack Smith and his team will have to significantly restructure their case against the former president, and the evidence they can rely upon to support it,  if they want to continue. The trial was put on pause pending this decision.\nMonday's 6-3 ruling guarantees any prosecution that emerges from this decision will be delayed well past November\u2019s presidential election, as the trial court sorts through the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance.\nIn effect, the six conservative justices have set an extremely high bar for Mr Smith and his team to meet.\nTrump, the court held, has total immunity for official acts as president related to his core constitutional duties. That includes the communications he had with Department of Justice officials about allegations of election fraud. And so, that portion of the indictment against Trump is effectively dead.\nBeyond that, the six justices said there is a presumption of immunity for any other official acts. In practical terms, that means prosecutors will have to work much harder to bring a case against Trump.\nThe court added, however, that presidents do not have immunity for non-official actions.\nChief Justice John Roberts, in his opinion, went on to apply this standard specifically to the former president \u2013 guidance that could be particularly damaging to the prosecution in the election interference case.\nTrump\u2019s attempts to pressure Vice President Mike Pence not to certify Joe Biden\u2019s election victory \u2013 a key part of Jack Smith\u2019s case \u2013 is the kind of official action subject to that higher standard of legal review.\nThe former president\u2019s comments on 6 January 2021, which are alleged to have incited the Capitol attack, are also likely to be deemed official actions.\nThe chief justice also said \u201ctestimony or private records of the president or his advisers\u201d are not admissible in court. This greatly limits the kinds of evidence prosecutors can introduce to support their case, even in instances involving non-official actions.\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s contacts with private citizens will have to be considered by the trial court as to whether they are unofficial actions.\nJustice Roberts explained that presidents need such broad immunity for official actions because the threat of criminal prosecution \u2013 and the \u201cpeculiar public opprobrium that attaches to criminal proceedings\u201d - might \u201cdistort\u201d presidential decision-making.\n\u201cThe president is not above the law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut Congress may not criminalise the president\u2019s conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the executive branch under the Constitution.\u201d\nIf the former president and his team were celebrating the decision as a victory for American democracy, the three liberal justices on the court had a very different view.\n\u201cIn every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in her opinion disagreeing with the court\u2019s ruling.\nShe went on to list a variety of actions for which presidents could not be prosecuted, such as ordering the assassination of a political rival, taking bribes in exchange for pardons and organising a coup to hold on to power.\n\u201cImmune,\" she wrote. \"Immune, immune, immune.\"\n\u201cWith fear for our democracy,\u201d she concluded, \u201cI dissent.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court now hands the election interference case back to the lower court judge, who will have to apply the details of the decision. Those decisions will also be subject to appeal and review \u2013 a process that could take months if not years.\nAnd if Trump wins the presidency in November, his appointees to the justice department could drop the case entirely.",
    "\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has asked his prime minister, Gabriel Attal, to remain in post \"for the time being to ensure the country's stability\", after election results left no party with an outright majority.\nMr Attal, who led the president's Ensemble alliance's election campaign, handed his resignation to Mr Macron on Monday, only for the president to refuse.\nAlthough Ensemble lost many of its seats in Sunday's parliament election, it came second, behind a left-wing alliance but ahead of the far right which had been expected to win.\nThe unexpected result leaves French politics in deadlock, with no party able to form a government by itself.\nThe New Popular Front, a left-wing alliance cobbled together after Mr Macron called the elections, argues that as the leading group in the next National Assembly it has earned the right to choose a prime minister.\nThey were due to meet on Monday to consider who to propose for the job, but there is no obvious candidate who would satisfy the radical France Unbowed (LFI) party as well as the more moderate Socialists, Greens and Communists.\nMr Attal had announced he would resign on Sunday night, but left open the possibility of remaining in the job as long as duty required him to do so. \nIt had been widely expected that his resignation would be rejected when he visited the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Monday morning.\nPresident Macron is due to fly to the US on Tuesday for a Nato summit and Paris is hosting the Olympic Games from 26 July. \nWhile it is not yet clear how long he needs Mr Attal to stay in office, the president made it clear that France now needed a period of calm.\nOutgoing Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned on Monday that the country was facing an immediate risk of financial crisis and economic decline.\nSince the results came out, Mr Macron has sought to steer clear of the political fray. A statement on Sunday night said that while he would respect the \"choice of the French people\", he was waiting for the full picture to emerge in parliament before taking the next, necessary decisions.\nThe National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella had been widely expected to win the election, after taking a strong lead in Sunday's first round. \nBut even though their vote held up, with more than 10 million people backing RN and a group of conservative allies, they failed to come anywhere near the number of seats suggested by opinion polls,\nThey ended up with 143 seats, when they had set themselves the ambition of reaching an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly.\nThe party's two leaders had bitterly accused the left and centrist blocs of stitching up the vote, with more than 200 candidates dropping out to give a rival candidate a chance of defeating RN.\nBut by Monday, Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella were trying to look ahead.\n\"In just two years, progress has been incredible and makes victory for us inevitable in the short term,\" said Ms Le Pen, thanking the 10 million voters who backed RN and its allies. \"The number one party for numbers of votes and MPs.\"\nMr Bardella was determined to focus on his future role in the European Parliament.\nHe is now going to lead a new grouping the European Parliament called Patriots for Europe, formed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\nHungary has taken over the presidency of the EU this month, and already Mr Orban has angered several of his European counterparts by becoming the first EU leader to visit Russia's Vladimir Putin in more than two years.\nPresident Macron had called France's snap parliamentary vote in response to RN's victory in EU elections only a month ago.

    "Proposals to upgrade a historic town centre building have had to be pared back after developers found more damage than expected.\nWork began in February to transform Blackpool's Art Deco Stanley Buildings into a modern business hub as part of a \u00a37.5m investment due to be completed by spring.\nA like-for-like replacement of faience tiles, which cover the upper floors of the building, had been proposed. \nBut the number of damaged blocks has been found to have more than doubled from the 99 originally identified to about 235.\nSandstone tiles will be used instead as a way of keeping down costs. \nTown hall planners approved the changes despite the fact the building is in a conservation area.\nA council report said \"further survey work has identified that the building is in a poorer condition than previously appreciated\" but the proposed sandstone alternative \"is a good visual match for the Darwen Terracotta faience\".\nAs the changes are higher up on the building, the switch will not be noticeable.\nThe report adds: \"Whilst the use of an alternative block is unfortunate, this harm is considered to be less than substantial harm to the significance of the building or the conservation area.\n\"The public benefits of bringing the upper floors back into beneficial use and refurbishing the building to safeguard its\u2019 future, outweighs that harm.\"\nThe scheme will see the Stanley Buildings, built in 1935, converted into 44 offices and meeting rooms with flexible co-worker space on the ground floor.\nThe building, which sits between Caunce Street, Church Street and Cookson Street, was designed by renowned borough architect John Charles Robinson, famous for former civic landmarks including Derby Baths and South Shore Open Air Baths.\nRestoration includes roof replacement, installation of new windows to all upper floors, brick repair and render, and restoration and cleaning of exterior faience and mosaic tiles. \nThe project is being funded by a combination of \u00a34.5m from the Town Deal, \u00a32.8m from the council and \u00a3200k from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Cheltenham Literature Festival is \"not planning to go anywhere\" after an investment firm withdrew its funding, a senior member of its team has said.\nBaillie Gifford has ended sponsorship deals with a number of book festivals, including Hay Festival and the Edinburgh International Book Festival following controversy over links to fossil fuel firms and Israel.\nNicola Tuxworth, head of programming at Cheltenham Literature Festival, said: \"We've been at the heart of this community for 75 years. We will be keeping going with our free programme.\"\nBaillie Gifford said is not a \"significant fossil fuel investor\" and have called claims raised by campaign group Fossil Free Books \"seriously misleading\".\nCheltenham is one of nine literary festivals calling on supporters for \"increased support\" amid the sudden loss of funding.\nAs a group, the nine festivals said their collective efforts had sold \u00a31.5m of books, engaged 64,000 schoolchildren in free activities, offered 99,000 free or subsidised events and reached audiences across all 121 postcodes of the UK.\nBaillie Gifford's sponsorship funded activities and events for children and families such as author reading sessions and stilt-walkers. \nMs Tuxworth said the loss of investment was a blow as the festival was still recovering from Covid and securing funding from various sources was getting harder.\nShe added that the festival is committed to all its activities for its 75th anniversary 2024 event taking place in October.\n\"Last year we had 12,000 schoolchildren on site and we're certainly looking at similar numbers again this year, probably more, which I think shows you how important it is that the festival carries on and they can access these top authors who can inspire children for the rest of their lives.\n\"Building the site costs about \u00a31.2m and that's before anyone has even booked a ticket or set foot in any of our venues, and 25% of our events are free.\"\nChildren's author John Dougherty, who is set to hold a poetry event for 60 schoolchildren at this year's festival, said outreach events were a \"tremendous part of what any good literature festival would do\". \n\"When a kid sees an actual flesh and blood person there and realises 'this is just a flesh and blood person, and yet they're talking about the books they've written', for a lot of kids that's the moment at which they go 'that could be me, I could do that.\" \n\"I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this sort of thing can help social mobility,\"  added the author from Stroud.\nA spokesperson for Baillie Gifford said suggestions that it is a \"large investor\" in fossil fuels and Israel \"is seriously misleading\".\nThey explained how the company is a \"large investor\" in several multinational technology companies, including Amazon and Meta, which, in the context of their overall business, have \"tiny\" commercial dealing with Israel.\nThey also went on to clarify it is also a \"minor shareholder\" in companies such as Airbnb, which have been identified as having \"problematic operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories\".\n\"These operations are small in the context of their overall business,\" they said.\nThe company said activists were \u201cpainting an inaccurate picture and attempting to mislead the public\".\nThey added: \"Only 2% of our clients\u2019 money is invested in companies with some business related to fossil fuels.\n\u201cWe are a private business managing other people\u2019s money, not our own.

    "A children's hospital in Kyiv has been hit after Russia launched a wave of missile strikes against cities across Ukraine.\nTwo people died when the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital - Ukraine's biggest paediatrics facility - sustained major damage during the blast. \nThirty-six people were killed and 140 people were injured in the strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on Monday.\nRussia denied targeting the hospital, saying it had been hit by fragments of a Ukrainian air defence missile, while Ukraine said it had found remnants of a Russian cruise missile.\nLesia Lysytsia, a doctor at the hospital, told the BBC the moment the missile struck had been \"like in a film\" with a \"big light, then an awful sound\".\n\"One part of the hospital was destroyed and there was a fire in another. It's really very damaged - maybe 60-70% of the hospital,\" she said.\nPictures from the scene showed young children - some with IV drips - sitting outside the hospital as it was evacuated.\nVitaliy Klitschko, Kyiv's mayor, said the two who died at the hospital were adults - one of whom was a doctor. He added that rescuers feared more people were trapped under the rubble.\nOhmatdyt is a major hospital which carries out cancer treatment and organ transplants.\n\"Now we are in the process of evacuating patients to the nearest hospital.. [but] many patients are intubated and on ventilators and cannot have contact with other patients or go outside,\" Dr Lysytsia said.\nHospital officials told Ukrainian TV that about 20 children were being treated in the ward which was hit.\nFollowing the strike, Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina wore a black ribbon as a mark of respect when she played in the round of 16 at Wimbledon on Monday afternoon.\nMayor Klitschko accused Russia of attempting the \"genocide of [the] population in Ukraine\".\n\"Right now the whole world can see how Russian missiles and Kamikaze drones killed Ukrainian citizens in our peaceful city.\" \nThe mayor added that a separate maternity hospital in Kyiv's Dniprovsky district had also been partially destroyed by falling debris, killing seven people.\nMr Zelensky wrote on social media that \"more than 40 missiles of different types\" had hit buildings and infrastructure in cities including Kyiv, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.\nHe called for a stronger Western response \"to the blow that Russia has once again delivered on our population, on our land, on our children\".\nDnipro regional head Sergiy Lysak said one person was killed in Dnipro city and six more injured. He added that a high-rise building and a business had been hit.\nThree people were killed in Pokrovsk, in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have taken control of a number of villages in recent weeks.\nThe Russian bombardment comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Moscow for a two-day state visit where he is due to hold talks with President Vladimir Putin.\nThe Security Service of Ukraine has published pictures of what it says are fragments of a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile recovered from the site.\nUkraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov responded to the attacks by urging the country's allies to help quickly strengthen its air defences.\n\"Our defence capabilities are still insufficient... We need more air defence systems,\" he said.\nUkraine's allies have condemned the attack on the Ohmatdyt hospital, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accusing Russia of \"ruthlessly targeting Ukrainian civilians\".\nNew UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \"we must hold those responsible for Putin's illegal war to account\".\nUN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres strongly condemned the strikes, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, adding he found the attack on the children's hospital and another medical facility \"particularly shocking\".\n\"Directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects is prohibited by international humanitarian law, and any such attacks are unacceptable and must end immediately,\" he said.\nThe UN's human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has said civilian casualties have been mounting in recent months, as Russia renewed its air campaign. A recent report said May was the deadliest month for civilian deaths in almost a year. ",

    "When BP struck oil in the North Sea in 1970, Aberdeen struck gold.\nThe discovery of the giant Forties Field was the beginning of a boom which brought jobs for the city, profits for energy giants, and taxes for the Treasury.\nIt fuelled the rise of nationalism too, with the UK government privately acknowledging that oil had the potential to make an independent Scotland one of the richest nations in Europe. \nBut North Sea production peaked 25 years ago and in this general election the focus is on managing a shift to renewable energy including wind, wave and solar.\nThe UK's main political parties are signed up to reaching \"net zero\", which means a nation taking out more greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere than it puts in.\nBut when it comes to the pace of change they are being pulled in different directions.\nEnvironmentalists are urging the UK to immediately slash its production of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal.\nIndustry leaders, trade unionists and local officials are all worried about the economic impact of a rapid transition to greener energy projects.\nThe trade body Offshore Energies UK (formerly Oil & Gas UK) says the sector added \u00a330bn to the economy in 2022, supporting 200,000 UK jobs including 90,000 in Scotland. \nIf you stopped oil and gas production immediately, says Andy Shirreffs, who works offshore, \"you'd bankrupt this area. This place would be devastated.\"\n\u201cThis is how I make my living,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis is how I feed my kids and put them through education and if I can't do that, then I'm struggling.\u201d\nBut are oil and gas firms struggling?\nIn 2022, after global oil prices were pushed up by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, BP made $27.7bn. Shell's profits were $39.9bn, the highest earnings in its 115-year history.\nThe UK Conservative government responded with a windfall tax \u2013 a levy imposed on companies that have benefited from something for which they were not responsible. \nIt pushed the overall rate of tax on oil and gas production to 75%, which will apply until at least March 2029 if the Tories win Thursday's election.\nLabour wants to increase the rate to 78% and to remove some tax breaks for investment.\nThe Liberal Democrats' manifesto proposes a \"proper, one-off windfall tax on the super-profits of oil and gas producers and traders\".\nThe Scottish National Party says it supports the existing windfall tax rate, adding that further powers over taxation should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.\nRyan Crighton of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce says the windfall tax was supposed to be a one-off but has now been extended for six years and is having an impact on jobs.\nHe is even more concerned about the potential removal of the investment tax breaks which, he says, would mean that firms \"can't recycle profits into new projects and create more jobs in the economy here\".\nThe issue is a hot topic in three north east Scotland seats where polls suggest the SNP are, after boundary changes, challenging incumbent Conservatives.\nBut politicians also face more fundamental questions about the UK's energy mix.\nFirst, who owns the nation's natural resources, and who should profit from them?\nCampaigners for Scottish independence have long argued that the riches beneath the North Sea should have been exploited for public not private gain.\nThey point to the example of Norway, which in 1972 set up a state-controlled company to extract its share of North Sea oil, investing the proceeds in a sovereign wealth fund.\nThat debate about public versus private ownership has flared again in relation to renewable energy.\nIn 2022, Labour promised to set up Great British Energy, a \"publicly-owned clean energy generation company,\" which the party later said would operate like Sweden's Vattenfall or Denmark's Orsted.\nBut in subsequent interviews, senior Labour figures including the leader Sir Keir Starmer said GB Energy \"would be an investment vehicle...not an energy company\".\nUnions say they would like more clarity about the plans.\nUnite, which says it has thousands of members in the offshore oil industry, has refused to endorse Labour\u2019s manifesto in part because of the party\u2019s energy policy.\nLast week the union, which has previously donated large sums to Labour, organised a demonstration in Aberdeen, explicitly criticising the party.\nWaving banners, union members chanted \u201cno ban without a plan\u201d.\n\"We don't want a repeat of what happened to the miners,\" said Unite organiser Claire Peden, adding: \"We're saying no more blank cheques for the Labour Party.\n\u201cIf they don't side with workers, don't side with communities, obviously that funding will fund campaigns like this instead of going to the party.\"\nMs Peden says under Labour's current plans up to 100,000 workers could lose their jobs, including as many as 35,000 in Scotland.\nAre such warnings credible?\nIt depends, says Prof Paul de Leeuw, director of the Energy Transition Institute at Aberdeen\u2019s Robert Gordon University.\nHe says if there is \"no support for ",

    "Hippos can trot so fast they can glide through the air for a period of time, according to animal experts.\nResearch from the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) suggests that all four of their feet can leave the ground for up to 0.3 seconds at a time.\nThe discovery was made after two hippos at Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire were filmed moving in their paddock.\nKieran Holliday, from the zoo and theme park resort near Pickering, said the study had led to new discoveries around \"hippo locomotion\".\nHippos are among the largest land animals, weighing up to two tonnes.\nPrevious studies had suggested the animals were similar to elephants in often using a standard four-footed (quadrupedal) walk, with a footfall sequence of left hind, left fore, right hind, right fore.\nHowever, Prof John Hutchinson and former RVC undergraduate student Emily Pringle looked into this further as they collected video footage of two hippos moving around at Flamingo Land.\nWhen comparing their videos to online footage of hippos moving, they found the animals were able to almost trot, even when walking slowly or running quickly.\nProf Hutchinson, who was the lead author of the study, said it was \u201creally impressive\u201d to see how hippos got airborne when they moved quickly.\nHe said: \"It's hard to work with hippos as they tend to stick to the water and very seldom are trained to be studied in zoo collections.\n\"They're also very dangerous. That's part of the reason why science knew little about how hippos move before our research.\n\"We're thrilled to provide the first study purely focused on revealing how hippos walk and run.\"\n\"We were pleasantly surprised to see how hippos get airborne when they move quickly.\"\nFlamingo Land science and conservation officer Mr Holliday said: \"Understanding more about the species we work with will only help us to improve the care we can give them in the future, and the fact that this paper has uncovered possible new discoveries into hippo locomotion could have positive impacts to the wider zoo community in regards to husbandry and enclosure design.\"\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter), and\u00a0Instagram.

    "First came the sharp clack of metal on metal, then the scuffing of shoes on gravel, and finally a chorus of polite applause.\nOn a bright, blustery morning this week, thousands of people gathered in a park in the southern port city of Marseille, taking their minds off France\u2019s seething political divisions and focusing instead on the beloved local sport of p\u00e9tanque.\nAnd this was no casual game, but rather a quarter finals match at the World P\u00e9tanque Championships \u2013 an annual televised event held on France\u2019s Mediterranean coast, and overlapping this year with the nation\u2019s unexpected parliamentary elections.\n\u201cThe show must go on. P\u00e9tanque must go on. Smiling must go on,\u201d said Laurence Astier, head of communications for the championships.\n\u201cFrance is the best nation in the world, of course, at this sport. But the other ones are Thailand and Benin. It\u2019s an international sport,\u201d Astier enthused.\nAround her, in the dappled shade of the park\u2019s leafy avenues, the crowds moved between matches, beer in hand, necks craned for a glimpse of the action.\n\u201cI lost yesterday,\u201d said George Gonzalez-Gomez, 68, a retired civil servant, with a cheerful shrug.\nBut even here, the discordant clamour of France\u2019s polarised politics sometimes broke through.\n\u201cFachos,\u201d - fascists - said a man near the entrance, waving a copy of La Marsaillaise, the proudly communist newspaper that was sponsoring the championship. He was referring to supporters of the far-right National Rally, which looks likely to win the most seats in France\u2019s parliament.\n\u201cI support the National Rally. We need to fix the country,\u201d countered Gonzalez-Gomez, blaming immigrants for Marseille\u2019s high crime rate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the way you had Brexit. Things were calmer after that. Now there is delinquency, crime, and [Islamist] radicalisation. As for [President] Macron - he is finished,\u201d he said, arguing that France should take back control of its borders from the European Union.\nIn Marseille, candidates for the National Rally (RN) \u2013 the far-right, staunchly anti-immigration party that won 33% of the vote in the first round of France\u2019s parliamentary elections last week \u2013 have steered clear of media interviews since their electoral success. Local press are referring to them as \u201cphantom candidates\u201d.\nBut their members are actively trying to rally support for their party online.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the last bastion against chaos,\u201d candidate Olivier Fayssat wrote on X.\n\"Less immigration means fewer homeless people and more money for the people of Marseilles,\u201d Gis\u00e8le Lelouis, another RN candidate, posted on the site.\nWith its luxury yachts, ancient architecture, and crowded, impoverished quartiers, Marseille has always been a chaotic melting pot of a city, due to its position on the Mediterranean coast and its history as a gateway to France and beyond.\nIn recent years National Rally has built up a powerful support base across the south, but has always been strongly challenged by parties from the left and the centre. This election has changed that balance, with President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist candidates already losing their seats in the city in the first round.\n\u201cMacron\u2026 is not popular here at all,\u201d said Gilles Rof, the local correspondent for Le Monde newspaper, explaining that residents have not yet felt the impact of the president\u2019s multi-billion euro infrastructure project for Marseille, and are, more generally, in a mood to shake things up.\nRof argued that racism lay at the root of much of the anti-immigrant sentiment in parts of the city, and that RN was playing on people\u2019s legitimate concerns about crime.\n\u201cThe basis of this vote [for RN] is clearly racism. [Their supporters say] there are too many immigrants and too many Arabic people. You can hear that all the time. It\u2019s out in the open,\u201d he said.\nMuch of the crime is linked to Marseille\u2019s powerful drug gangs, which operate \u2013 often quite openly - in some of the poorer suburbs north of the city.\nIn a windswept neighbourhood one afternoon this week, a small crowd gathered to offer support for their parliamentary candidate, a 20-year-old man of Algerian heritage.\n\u201cFront Populaire! Front Populaire! Amine Kessaci! Amine Kessaci!\u201d people chanted, naming France\u2019s new left-wing coalition and its young would-be deputy.\nMr Kessaci\u2019s social activism - focused on tackling crime and on local empowerment - was influenced by the death of his brother in a drug-gang-related murder in 2020. \nHe said migrants were being scapegoated by the far right for political gain, and that poverty and unemployment needed to be addressed as a priority.\n\u201cThis election\u2026 is a rendezvous with history.

    "A US citizen has been sentenced to 12.5 years at a maximum security penal colony by a Russian court after being convicted on drugs charges. \nRobert Woodland, 32, was detained in Moscow in January and accused by prosecutors of seeking to sell a large quantity of methadone. His lawyer told the Reuters news agency that he had partially confessed to the charges.\nMr Woodland, who was born in Russia and adopted when he was two, had travelled to the country in 2020 to find his birth mother. His journey was documented by a Russian reality TV programme.\nHe is the latest US citizen to be imprisoned in the country, with some Western officials suggesting the Kremlin is \"hoarding\" Americans to trade for allies and operatives imprisoned abroad. \nIn a statement released after Mr Woodland's conviction on Thursday, Russian prosecutors said he had been caught while packaging a large quantity of narcotics at an apartment in the Russian capital. \nThey claimed he had been working with a large-scale criminal group and had transported 50-grams of the drug from a pick-up point outside the city. \nHis lawyer, Stanislav Kshevitsky, had initially denied the charges, saying officials had presented \"no evidence\" of drug sales before the court. \nBut he told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Mr Woodland had confessed to some of the allegations against him. It remains unclear which charges he has accepted. \nFootage carried by state media in Russia showed Mr Woodland sitting inside a glass cage in court, staring impassively ahead as the verdict against him was read out. \nRussian media reported that Mr Woodland decided to remain in the country after meeting his mother in 2020 and worked as an English teacher near Moscow. His tearful reunion with his mother was broadcast on state television at the time. \nThe Interfax news agency said he holds US and Russian citizenship. \nAt least a dozen US nationals, including journalists and active duty soldiers, are currently being held in Russian prisons and penal colonies. \nAmong those is Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained over a year ago on espionage charges which he denies. The US considers him to be \"wrongfully detained\".\nWestern officials have long suspected that Moscow is seeking to detain Western citizens to use as bargaining chips in prisoner swaps. US law prohibits the payment of ransoms to terror groups, but successive administrations have been willing to offer concessions to other states to secure the release of Americans. \nThis is what happened to Brittney Griner, who was released at the end of 2022 in a prisoner swap with the US in return for the controversial Russian arms dealer Victor Bout.\nWhile the US state department said earlier this year that it was aware of Mr Woodland's case, it avoided commenting directly on the allegations. \nInstead, it issued a statement saying it \u201chas no greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas\".\nUS officials have repeatedly warned US citizens in Russia to leave the country, citing the risk of wrongful arrest and harassment by authorities.

    "Emergency works are to close a busy city road over fears a river wall could fail.\nBristol City Council said a 395ft (120m) stretch of York Road either side of Langton Street Bridge - commonly known as the Banana Bridge - would close next Monday. \nIt added that electronic sensors had shown movement of a masonry wall along the New Cut of the River Avon was speeding up and could fail \"if urgent action is not taken\". \nWith work to be carried out in two stages, York Road will be closed for up to 12 weeks. \nCouncillor Ed Plowden, chair of the transport and connectivity committee, said the works were \"vital\", adding: \"If left any longer, there is a risk that this section could fail, leading to severe consequences.\"\nHe also drew a parallel with the \"very serious\" collapse on Cumberland Road in January 2020, which led to years of repairs.\nLangton Street Bridge itself is seven weeks into an 18-month restoration programme, which it will remain completely closed throughout. \nThe emergency works on the wall along York Road would include placing one-tonne bags along the riverbank to \"reduce the tidal pressure on the wall\", the council said. \nThis was designed to secure the wall until long-term works could be carried out, it said. \nTo allow heavy lifting machinery to work in the area, York Road will be closed in two phases. \nThe first will see St Luke\u2019s Road towards Bath Bridges roundabout closed for six weeks, while the second will see the section between St Luke\u2019s Road and Spring Street shut for another six weeks. \nThe council said it would signpost diversionary routes, but added people should factor the closures into their journeys and avoid surrounding streets.\nResidents along the road will still have access, and the closures are not set to impact the businesses near Bath Bridge roundabout. \nPedestrians and cyclists would also still be able to use the route, officials said. \nIn order to carry out the works, the council said four plane trees would need to be felled or pruned back \"under the guidance of ecologists\". \nThese were set to be replaced with new trees as part of the long-term permanent repairs planned, the authority said. \nMr Plowden said it was \"always a last resort to remove any trees\". \n\"I have asked the team to make every effort to work around the valuable street trees,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Maternity staff at an NHS trust faced racism from their own colleagues, a Care Quality Commission (CQC) report said.\nThe problem was identified at both the Luton and Dunstable (L&D) and Bedford hospitals during an inspection.\nSome ethnic minority overseas staff told the CQC discrimination had become \"normalised\".\nThe Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it was addressing these issues. \nThe regulator was alerted to concerns around the safety, culture, and management of the service by whistleblowers.\nOn the first day of the inspection, last November, the Luton and Dunstable Hospital's maternity unit was at full capacity and the trust had to divert new arrivals.\nLow staffing levels also meant women and babies were not always kept safe. \nThe trust was issued with a warning to improve and maternity services at both hospitals have now both been rated as 'inadequate'.\nAt the L&D some staff told the inspectors they did not feel able to report instances of racism.\nManagement acknowledged some parts of the unit had a \"challenging culture\".\nThere were concerns racist incidents being reported to the trust would not be investigated in line with the trust\u2019s values. \nAt Bedford similar issues were reported.\nAccording to trust data, there were also disparities in pay among staff of different ethnicities. \nAt the L&D, white staff were almost twice as likely to be appointed to jobs after being shortlisted. \nThe hospital's board was also among the worst in the country for ethnic minority representation. \nStuart Dunn, CQC deputy director of operations in the East of England, said: \u201cWe were concerned to find low staffing for midwives was still a significant risk to the safety of women using these services and their babies despite us telling the trust they needed to address this previously.\"\nHe said the trust had recruited midwives from abroad to help tackle this but this was \"being undermined by racism against staff, by their own colleagues, and a lack of support from leaders\".  \nHe continued: \u201cSome international midwives told us they often felt excluded, and that it was normalised for colleagues from ethnic minorities to experience discrimination from colleagues\". \nIn the trust\u2019s 2022 staff survey, a third of all midwives reported experiencing at least one incident of bullying or harassment from colleagues, Mr Dunn said. \nIn response, the chief executive of Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, David Carter, said: \"As a trust committed to delivering excellent care, the CQC feedback was disappointing for us to hear but we are focussing our effort on ensuring that our maternity services consistently meets the standards of care we aspire to give.\n\u201cWe were disappointed to hear that our international midwives reported issues of discrimination. Any act of discrimination or racism is unacceptable and the trust is committed to ensuring any issues are addressed\".\nMr Carter added that the vacancy rate for registered midwives had been reduced to 6.6% on the L&D site, while Bedford was now fully staffed.\n\nWhile maternity services are now rated \u2018inadequate\u2019 the overall rating of the Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust remained \u2018good\u2019.\nThe trust said it had now began a culture and development programme for staff to provide training on \"cultural competency, unconscious bias, and anti-racism practices\".\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Scotland's 57 MPs are preparing to be sworn in at Westminster after a dramatic general election.\nFor some of the group, it will be a familiar experience but for a large number it will be their first taste of the Commons.\nParliament is resuming after a general election which saw Labour retake power for the first time in 14 years, with Sir Keir Starmer becoming prime minister.\nCentral to that victory was a remarkable night for the party in Scotland, as swathes of SNP seats turned red.\nAs a result the number of Labour MPs soared from two - Ian Murray and Michael Shanks - to 37.\nThe group met Sir Keir at Downing Street before being sworn in. \nMr Murray, who has been appointed secretary of state for Scotland, said protecting jobs at the Grangemouth refinery was top of his agenda, describing the site as \u201chugely important to our clean energy ambitions\u201d.\nOne man who won't need the help of the map distributed to new MPs is Douglas Alexander.\nHe took Lothian East to secure a return to parliament after losing his seat to the SNP's Mhairi Black in 2015.\nThe former Scottish secretary, who was first elected to Westminster in 1997, was at the heart of the Blair and Brown governments.\nAnother familiar face for Labour is Pamela Nash, who was the MP for Airdrie and Shotts from 2010 to 2015 - when she was the youngest MP in the Commons.\nMs Nash then served as the chief executive for the Scotland In Union campaign group and has now won another Lanarkshire seat, taking Motherwell, Wishaw and Carluke.     \nThey are joined by two MPs with prior experience of Holyrood - both Patricia Ferguson (Glasgow West) and Richard Baker (Glenrothes and Mid Fife) served as MSPs in the past.\nHowever the majority of Labour's new intake are fresh faces, who will be paired up with a member of the parliamentary staff in a \"buddy system\" to make sure they don't get lost. \nFor now they will simply be given lockers and security passes. Offices will follow later on.\nMany of the new crop have political experience though, from serving as local councillors to more varied roles. \nBlair McDougall (East Renfrewshire) was the lead strategist for Better Together during the independence referendum campaign in 2014, and Kirsty McNeill (Midlothian) worked as an advisor to Gordon Brown.  \nJoani Reid (East Kilbride and Strathaven) is the grandaughter of the legendary trade unionist Jimmy Reid.\nHe famously led a successful work-in at the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) in 1971 which halted government plans to close the yards. \nMs Reid told BBC Scotland News the election victory showed that Labour was \"back in the service of working people\".\nShe added that she felt society had not progressed enough since her grandfather's time.\nMs Reid added: \"I think if progress means anything, it means you have got more opportunities, regardless of where you're born than you than the last generation, and that something isn't happening.\n\"That's the job for the Labour Party now to fix that.\"\nZubir Ahmed (Glasgow South West) previously worked as a transplant surgeon and was inspired to enter politics by the state of the health service following the Covid pandemic.\nMeanwhile Torcuil Crichton (Na h-Eileanan an Iar) was the Daily Record's Westminster editor.\nVictories for other parties mostly came via established regulars, rather than a new crop of politicians.\nSNP stalwart  Pete Wishart (Perth and North Perthshire) continues his lengthy stint as an MP, having first been elected in 2001, while the party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn held on to his seat .\nStephen Gethins, who represented North East Fife until 2019, returns to parliament having taken Arbroath and Broughty Ferry for the SNP. \nSeamus Logan provided arguably the SNP's greatest success story of the night as he defeated Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East.\nMr Logan spent over three decades working in health and social care before a spell as a tour guide, and eventually a stint as an SNP councillor. \nMr Ross' defeat denied him a return to Westminster but several of his colleagues will be back, including the former Scottish secretary David Mundell, who returns as MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale.\nMeanwhile, Harriet Cross became the party's first female MP in five years when she took the Gordon and Buchan seat.\nJohn Lamont retained his Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk seat and on Monday was named as shadow secretary of state for Scotland.\nFor the Liberal Democrats, two of their number will experience Westminster for the first time later - Susan Murray in Mid Dunbartonshire and Angus MacDonald in Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire. \nBusinessman Mr MacDonald had a particularly lengthy wait.\nA recount meant that he did not have his victory over the SNP's Drew Hendry confirmed until Saturday, in the last election result announced across the UK.

    "Nine babies have died from whooping cough since November 2023, with cases continuing to rise, the UK Health Security Agency says. \nIts latest figures for England show 2,591 confirmed cases in May, with a total of 7,599 since January.\nExperts worry this is a bumper year for the bacterial infection, which can be particularly harmful for young babies. \nThey are urging pregnant women and children to ensure they are up-to-date with vaccines.\nThe last peak was in 2016, when there were some 5,945 cases.\nWhooping cough - also known as the 100-day cough and by its medical name, pertussis -  is a bacterial infection that can affect the lungs and cause prolonged bouts of coughing. \nMore than half of the 7,599 cases from January to May have been in over-14s, who usually get a mild illness. \nBut 262 were in babies under three months, who are at the highest risk of complications and death.\nWhooping-cough cases have been rising in England and many other countries since the beginning of the year. \nIt is cyclical, with peaks every three to five years. \nThe last was in 2016 and there was a major outbreak was in 2012 with more than 9,000 cases, before the introduction of a vaccine programme for pregnant women.\nThe UKHSA says the number of people getting whooping cough fell during the pandemic, leaving \"a peak year overdue\" and resulting in less immunity in the population. \nVaccination rates among pregnant women are also a factor  - with 58.9% uptake of jabs in March 2024 compared with a high of 72.6% in March 2017. \nUKHSA immunisation director Dr Mary Ramsay said: \"Ensuring women are vaccinated appropriately in pregnancy has never been more important.\n\"Pregnant women are offered a whooping-cough vaccine in every pregnancy, ideally between 20 and 32 weeks. \n\"This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life, when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines.\n\u201cOur thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby.\"\nWomen can get the vaccine through their GP or some antenatal clinics.\nAll babies are also offered three doses of the six-in-one vaccine, at eight, 12 and 16 weeks of age, to protect against whooping cough and other serious diseases.\nChildren are then offered a pre-school booster - and any who have not been vaccinated can still get the jab up to the age of 10.\nThe first signs of whooping cough can feel like a cold, with a runny nose and sore throat. \nAfter about a week, the infection can develop into coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are generally worse at night. \nSome young babies may also make a distinctive \"whoop\" sound or have difficulty breathing after a bout of coughing. But this is not always the case, which can make whooping cough hard to recognise.\nPeople with whooping cough should stay at home and not go to work, school or nursery until 48 hours after starting antibiotics or, if they have not had antibiotics, two weeks after symptoms start.

    "Hurricane Beryl has lashed Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula after wreaking havoc across the Caribbean, causing at least 10 deaths. \nIt made landfall as a category-two hurricane early on Friday, bringing winds of up to 175km/h (108mph). \nIt was later downgraded to a tropical storm, but is expected to re-intensify over the Gulf the Mexico at the weekend.\nBeryl brought heavy rain to tourist hotspots of Canc\u00fan and Tulum. No major damage was reported but the high winds felled trees and caused power outages.\nCivil protection chief Laura Velazquez said power would be fully restored to those still without it by Sunday. \nTulum resident Carolina Vazquez was among those to be affected by the outages, speaking to the Reuters news agency as she queued at a soup kitchen organised by the Mexican army on Friday. \n\"In my little house a tree fell down, half of the house cracked, the roof tiles,\" she said.\nFernando Trevino, an employee at a local business, said: \"We are evaluating, but so far it seems that everything is in order with the protections that were put in place, the preparations and so.\"\nAhead of Beryl's arrival, Schools were closed, hotel windows boarded up, and emergency shelters were set up in areas facing the brunt of the impact. \nMore than 8,000 troops from the army, air force and national guard were deployed in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula to provide support. \nHundreds of tourists were evacuated from hotels, and more than 3,000 fled from Holbox Island off the coast, according to local authorities.\nMore than 300 flights were cancelled or delayed.\nOn Thursday, many homes and businesses were badly damaged in the Cayman Islands, particularly along the coastline, where entire neighbourhoods were inundated.\nHurricane Beryl battered Jamaica on Wednesday after causing huge devastation across other Caribbean nations. \nHurricanes frequently occur near the peninsula, with the official storm season running from June to late November. \nThe storm is projected to travel over the Gulf of Mexico, moving towards north-eastern Mexico and southern Texas by the end of the weekend.\nBy the time it makes landfall again on Sunday evening, the storm is expected to have strengthened back to a hurricane.\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott told people near the state's Gulf coast to \"have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones\".\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season.",
    "Hamas has warned that Israel\u2019s latest military operations in Gaza and non-negotiable positions of Israel's prime minister could set ceasefire and hostage release talks \u201cback to square one\u201d.\nHopes of a breakthrough rose last week when the Palestinian armed group dropped a demand for Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire as a precondition.\nBut Hamas said Benjamin Netanyahu had created new \u201cobstacles\u201d ahead of the resumption of indirect talks in Qatar on Wednesday by setting out principles for any deal that included allowing Israel to resume the fighting.\nThere was no immediate Israeli response, while the US and a senior Palestinian official downplayed the significance of the public comments by both sides.\nIt came as Israeli tanks and troops reportedly pushed deeper into several central areas of Gaza City, sending thousands of Palestinian residents fleeing.\nThe Israeli military announced that its forces had killed \u201cdozens of terrorists\u201d in the operation, which it launched on Monday in response to what it said was intelligence indicating Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad infrastructure there.\nIt also said six underground tunnels about 6km (3.7 miles) long had been found and destroyed in Gaza City\u2019s eastern Shejaiya district, where a similar operation began more than a week ago.\nPalestinian health officials meanwhile reported that Israeli air strikes had killed at least 18 people across Gaza on Tuesday, including six in Gaza City.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 38,240 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 50 in the past day, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nOn Monday evening, Hamas put out a statement saying its Doha-based political leader Ismail Haniyeh had made \u201curgent contacts\u201d with Egyptian and Qatari mediators over what it called continued \u201cmassacres, killing and displacement\u201d of Palestinians by Israeli forces.\n\u201cHaniyeh warned of the disastrous repercussions of what is happening in Gaza City, Rafah and other areas across the Gaza Strip, noting that this could bring the negotiating process back to square one,\u201d it added.\nAnother Hamas statement accused the Israeli prime minister of \u201cplacing additional obstacles in the way of the negotiations\u201d.\nLast Thursday Mr Netanyahu told Israel\u2019s negotiators to resume work after Hamas dropped its demand for a permanent ceasefire at the outset of a proposed deal outlined by US President Joe Biden at the end of May.\nBut expectations were dampened on Sunday by a statement from the prime minister's office which insisted that four principles had to be part of any agreement.\nOne was that Israel could \u201cresume fighting until all of objectives of the war have been achieved\u201d - something Hamas has previously rejected. The others were that there would be no weapons smuggling into Gaza from Egypt, that armed fighters would not be allowed to return to northern Gaza, and that Israel would maximize the number of living hostages released.\nA deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 116 hostages are still being held, 41 of whom are presumed dead.\nMr Biden said the proposed new deal involved three phases.\nThe first would include a \"full and complete ceasefire\" lasting six weeks, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, and the exchange of some of the hostages - including women, the elderly and the sick or wounded - for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\nThe second phase would involve the release of all other living hostages and a \"permanent end to hostilities\". The third phase would see the start of a major reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of dead hostages' remains.\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby acknowledged that there were still \u201csome gaps\u201d between Israel and Hamas\u2019s positions.\nBut he stressed that CIA director William Burns and US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk would not have flown to Cairo for talks with their Egyptian, Israeli and Jordanian counterparts on Monday if they did not think those gaps could be closed.\n\u201cOn both sides, you see public comments that aren\u2019t necessarily fully reflective of the conversations that we\u2019re having privately with them or their interlocutors,\u201d he told reporters.\nHamas\u2019s statements were also viewed with scepticism by a senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations.\nThe official told the BBC that the recent progress would not have been possible had Hamas not relented on its demand for a permanent ceasefire, and that the group\u2019s comments reflected frustration at the recent Israeli military operations in Gaza City seemingly designed to exert pressure on it to make further concessions.\nHe also said a sense of cautious optimism was prevai",

    "Every July, Sabrija Hajdarevic returns to Srebrenica to visit the graves of her husband and father.\nThey were among around 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys killed in 1995 by the Serb forces.\nThe 67-year-old now lives thousands of miles away in Australia, but the annual trip means a lot to her.\nThis year is even more poignant, as for the first time 11 July will be marked as the International Day of Reflection and Commemoration, following a UN General Assembly ruling in May.\nThe Srebrenica massacre, recognised by the UN as a genocide, was the shocking climax of the war in Bosnia - a conflict that erupted after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.\nIn Bosnia, one of the countries emerging after the breakup, three communities were in conflict \u2013 on the one hand, Bosnian Serbs, backed by Serbia, and, on the other, Bosniaks and Croats.\nAbout 40,000 Bosniak Muslims lived in Srebrenica. Many were forced to flee a Bosnian Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing during the 1992-95 war.\nThe town was declared a UN safe zone in 1993 and a small group of international peacekeepers were charged with protecting it from any attacks.\nBut in July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces - led by military commander Ratko Mladic - stormed the town, overwhelming the peacekeepers who failed to protect the civilians sheltering there.\nThe Serb forces rounded up the town\u2019s men and boys, most of whom were never seen alive again.\nThey were either killed in droves or murdered when they tried to escape through the wooded hills around Srebrenica.\nThe brutal killing of around 8,000 men and boys became known as Europe's worst mass atrocity since World War Two. The remains of about 1,000 people are still missing.\nRatko Mladic was later jailed for life for war crimes, including genocide, and nearly 50 Bosnian Serbs were also convicted.\nThe recent UN resolution, designating 11 July an International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the Srebrenica Genocide, also condemned any denial of the massacre and glorification of war criminals.\nBut most Bosnian Serbs, as well as many people in Serbia, have repeatedly denied that what had occurred in Srebrenica in 1995 constituted genocide.\nSabrija pushes back at claims that the Srebrenica killings were not targeted.\n\u201cWhat happened should be known, instead of having all these lies flying around,\u201d she says. \u201cMy soul hurts.\u201d\nSome Bosniak families have been waiting for decades to lay their loved ones to rest, as the identification process is lengthy and difficult.\nSabrija was able to bury her husband\u2019s skull - the only body part which was unearthed.\nHer father\u2019s remains are yet to be found, although she knows he was killed close to their house in Srebrenica as her mother witnessed the killing.\nSix months after her father\u2019s murder, her mother died, too \u2013 \u201cof sorrow,\u201d says Sabrija, fighting back tears.\nMany victims of the Srebrenica massacre are buried at nearby Potocari cemetery. Thousands of simple white tombstones sit in a field on a slope of a hill, surrounded by woods.\nBerija Delic also lost her husband in the massacre. His remains were only found a decade later, and were buried in 2010.\nLast year, Berija decided to return to Srebrenica from Malta, where she sought refuge after the war.\nHer son, a Muslim, married a Serb Orthodox woman who \u201cloves my baclava,\u201d she says, referring to a sweet delicacy she cooks.\nBefore the 1990s war, Srebrenica was largely a Bosniak Muslim town. \nNow, the majority of the population is Serb; some of the residents had been soldiers during the conflict.\n\u201cEven now you see someone walking around town, and you know that he has killed [Bosniaks] - but you remain silent, you cannot deal with that,\u201d says Berija.\nFollowing the war, Bosnia was divided into two entities - Republika Srpska and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Srebrenica is in Republika Srpska.\nIn the years since the war, the Bosniak population dwindled and the Serb population grew, but now they have one problem in common \u2013 unemployment.\n\u201cSerbs and Bosniaks have no problems between them here, tensions are brought by people from the outside,\u201d says Slavisa Petrovic, a 37-year old Serb who runs the local tourist office.\nBut he says the town needs jobs for people to entice them to stay.\nThe recent UN resolution on the massacre has not changed anything, Slavisa adds.\n\u201cPeople are leaving Srebrenica now just like they as they did before it [the adoption of the resolution]. There are no jobs, just like there weren\u2019t before.\u201d\nThere are signs of decline in the town. A once popular local spa and a formerly luxurious hotel are closed, having been abandoned for decades.

    "Price rises in the US cooled in June, building hopes that the world's largest economy is moving on from the bout of high inflation that hit after the pandemic.\nPrices rose 3% over the 12 months to June, as lower petrol prices helped to deliver the slowest price inflation in a year, the Labor Department said.  \nIt marked the third month in a row that inflation has fallen, easing financial pressures on households and potentially clearing the way for the US central bank to cut interest rates as soon as September. \nThe Federal Reserve's key lending rate has stood at more than 5.3%, a roughly two-decade high, since last year.\nFed officials say high borrowing costs are weighing on the economy, helping to reduce the pressures pushing up prices.\nAnalysts said the latest report could help to convince the bank that it has done enough to cure the problem. \nFrom May to June, prices actually dropped 0.1% - the first outright monthly decline in years. \n\u201cThe latest inflation numbers put us firmly on the path for a September Fed rate cut,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.\nThe progress is welcome news for the White House, which has struggled with widespread economic dissatisfaction as the jump in living costs and interest rates squeeze households.\nOver the past year, petrol prices and the cost of cars and appliances have fallen, but the cost of other staples has continued to rise. \nGrocery prices are up 1.1% since June 2023, while housing costs have climbed 5.2%.\nLast month, the increases in rents and prices for services such as veterinary treatment cooled, noted Greg McBride, analyst for Bankrate.com \n\u201cShelter and services costs have been the long-standing and persistent trouble spots in the inflation readings but maybe the tide is starting to turn,\" he said. \nAt hearings in Washington this week, Republican lawmakers warned Fed chairman Jerome Powell that a rate cut ahead of the November election would be perceived as trying to \"gin up the economy\" for the president.\nMr Powell refused to speculate about when the Fed would make its next move, but defended the bank's political independence and said its decision would be rooted in the data. \nHe told lawmakers a cut was the most likely next step, noting that the bank was alert, not just to inflation figures, but also to signs that the economy was slowing.\n\"We're very much aware that we have two-sided risks now and we're determined to balance those as best we can,\" he said. \"We want to see more good inflation data and we also want to continue to see a strong labour market.\"\nIn June, the US unemployment rate crept above 4% for the first time in more than two years. \nConsumer spending, which is the main driver of the US economy, has also shown signs of weakening, as rising numbers of firms warn that households are cutting back. \nFood giant Pepsi-Co became the latest to do so on Thursday. \nIn a quarterly update for investors, it reported that sales in its North America Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods units had fallen in the April-June period compared with last year. Overall, revenue was up about 1% globally. ",
    "Private cannabis clinics are seeing a rise in patients as people choose the drug to treat chronic pain and mental health conditions.\nOne medical cannabis clinic in Westminster, Mamedica, said it had seen the number of patients increase by more than 10 times in 2023, rising from 250 to 2,750.\nCEO Jon Robson said this was down to a \u201clarge number of patients who are transitioning to us not just from the illicit market, but because they haven\u2019t found the treatments that the NHS can provide to be sufficient for their conditions\u201d.\nThe majority of patients at the clinic take medical cannabis for psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety and depression, with 40% taking the drug to treat chronic pain.\nIn a statement, the Department for Health and Social Care said that \"licensed cannabis-based medicines are routinely funded by the NHS where there is clear evidence of their quality, safety and effectiveness\".\nBut it added that \"most products on the market are unlicensed medicines, and clinical guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) demonstrate a clear need for more research to support routine prescribing and funding decisions on the NHS\".\nOne patient taking the drug for chronic pain is Julie Gould, from Wimbledon in south London.\nThe 64-year-old started using medical cannabis in 2020 after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in her 30s.\n\u201cI've got permanent damage. My walking's affected, my bowel, my bladder is affected,\u201d she says, comparing one of her symptoms to someone \u201chammering your brain with an ice-pick\u201d.\nShe used paracetamol and ibuprofen to relieve the pain until her neurologist prescribed her with amitriptyline, a pain medication also used as an antidepressant.\nBut the drug aggravated the symptoms of another condition - restless legs syndrome (RLS), which causes an \u201cunpleasant crawling or creeping sensation\u201d in the legs.\nMs Gould wants the drug to be \u201cheavily subsidised\u201d, adding that it's become \u201ctoo expensive for most people\u201d, especially if they need to take it more regularly to manage their symptoms.\n\u201cI can remember going to my GP, saying: \u2018I don't think I'm going to make it through. I haven't slept for two days and I really can't cope with this.\n\u201cI remember bursting into tears in front of her and she looked at me and said, \u2018as we get older we all get aches and pains\u2019.\u201d\nMs Gould started taking medical cannabis oil after getting a prescription through a private clinic and says it \u201cinstantly stops\u201d the nerve pain she experiences.\n\u201cIn my view, it's just a miraculous drug,\u201d she says, adding that it helped her through withdrawals after she was put on a new medication for her RLS.\nShe now only uses the medicine occasionally, but is concerned about how she would afford it if her symptoms got worse.\n\u201cIn 2020, 100ml of the oil I used cost about \u00a3150 - now that same 100ml is \u00a3350,\u201d she says.\nSativex, a cannabis-based spray used to treat MS muscle spasms, is licensed for prescription on the NHS, but the MS Society says there is an \u201cunacceptable postcode lottery\u201d for the drug.\nNHS England says it already offers several cannabis-based treatments that have been approved by the MHRA but \"many doctors and professional bodies rightly remain concerned about the limited evidence available concerning the safety and efficacy of unlicensed products\".\nIn a statement, it said \"manufacturers are encouraged to engage with the UK medicines licensing process, which can help provide specialist doctors with the confidence to use the products, in the same way they use any other licensed medicines that are recommended for use on the NHS.\u201d\nBefore 2018, medical cannabis products could not be legally prescribed in the UK.\nThis is because they were classified as Schedule One drugs, meaning that they were judged as having no therapeutic value.\nAfter a successful campaign to allow access to medical cannabis for children with severe epilepsy, medical cannabis was legalised.\nThis allows NHS or private specialist doctors to prescribe the drug - but only if other treatments have not been effective.\nBut an investigation by the BBC in 2023 found that fewer than five NHS patients had been prescribed with the drug so far.\nOne reason for this is that not all medical cannabis products are licensed.\nFirst, they need to go through clinical trials that are costly and complicated because of the many compounds in the cannabis plant.\nThere are a few licensed medical cannabis products, but they do not contain the whole plant.\nThey can only be prescribed on the NHS for severe epilepsy, for nausea from chemotherapy or for muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis.\nSpecialist NHS doctors can still prescribe unlicensed products if they think the patient will benefit, but they have to ask NHS England to pay for individual cases and are often turned down.\nPrivate specialists can also prescribe unlicensed products, but this often comes at a high cost for patients.\nEpidemiologist Michael Lynskey leads research on the T21 Pr",

    "A historical railway bridge will remain infilled by concrete after planning inspectors quashed an enforcement notice to have the concrete removed.\nWest Norfolk Council took action against National Highways after it poured 1,000 tons of concrete under Congham Bridge in 2021 to make the bridge safe.\nLast October, councillors rejected an attempt by National Highways to apply for retrospective permission for the work to be made permanent.\nNational Highways appealed to the government's Planning Inspectorate, which ruled in its favour at a public inquiry, which the council said was \"disappointing\".\nInspector Laura Renaudon, who considered the appeal, concluded that retrospective planning permission for the work would now be granted, noting that it was an \"unfortunate sequence of events\".\nIn a report, she said: \"The harm to the value of the heritage asset is regrettable but needs to be balanced against the asset's overall low significance, the fact that the bridge is preserved, albeit buried, and the other factors in the case.\"\nShe said that infilling the bridge allowed traffic \u2013 including agricultural vehicles - to pass over it, while reducing the \"local focus of anti-social behaviour\".\nShe added: \"Accordingly I find that the development complies with the development plan for the area.\"\nAbout 3,000 statements and pieces of evidence were submitted ahead of the public inquiry and experts on both sides appeared before the inspector.\nResponding to Wednesday's ruling, a council spokesperson said: \"This is very disappointing news and we know that objectors and campaigners will feel the same. \n\"We believed that we had put forward a strong case but accept the inspector\u2019s decision in this matter.\"\nOver the last two decades, Congham Bridge, which was built in 1926, had become corroded and began to develop fractures.\nNational Highways argued it had become unsafe and that filling it with concrete, as a temporary measure, was the most cost-effective way to support the structure.\nHowever it later broke permitted development regulations when it failed to remove the concrete within 12 months.\nCampaigners argued that the concrete should be removed and the bridge maintained.\nGraeme Bickerdike, a member of The HRE Group of engineers, heritage campaigners and greenway developers, said he was disappointed by the Planning Inspectorate's decision.\n\"This was an unnecessary and destructive scheme that has resulted in the loss of a noteworthy heritage asset of regional significance,\" he said.\n\"As we transition to more sustainable forms of transport, legacy railway structures have the potential to play an increasingly important role and their value must be recognised by those responsible for their custodianship.\n\"The loss of this one - simply to reduce liabilities - was short-sighted and indicative of cultural issues.\"\nCongham Bridge is one of just six which were built in the 1920s by William Marriott, engineer of the Midland and Great Northern Railway.\nThe railway route once connected South Lynn with Fakenham before continuing on to Great Yarmouth.\nThe line closed in 1959, preceding the Beeching cuts the following decade, which led to vast sections of the railway network to shut.\nBut the bridge has remained in use, carrying a quiet country road, St Andrews Lane, across the now-abandoned track.\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rossiter, head of the Historical Railways Estate at National Highways, said she welcomed the Planning Inspectorate's decision. \n\"This work was essential to ensure the bridge can safely carry traffic, including the many agricultural vehicles that rely on its use,\" she said.\n\"I am pleased that by following the democratic process this important decision was tested at a public inquiry with the outcome supporting our work and putting an end to many of the assertions that have been made during this process.\"\nCongham Bridge is one of 51 bridges that have been infilled since 2013 at a cost of \u00a38m, according to the Historical Railways Estate Group.\nEngineers have recently completed digging out hundreds of tonnes of concrete from Great Musgrave Bridge in Cumbria after Eden District Council ordered it to restore the Victorian structure last year.\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Guidance telling civil servants to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda in spite of rulings from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has been deemed lawful by the High Court.\nThe union for civil servants launched a legal challenge to ministers over fears the Rwanda scheme would force officials to break the law.\nBut in a ruling issued on Friday, Mr Justice Chamberlain dismissed the challenge.\nHowever, the future of the scheme is in doubt as Sir Keir Starmer, who became UK prime minister on Friday, has pledged to scrap it immediately. \nThe plan was a key part of former PM Rishi Sunak's pledge to stop migrants from crossing the English Channel in dangerous dinghies.\nUnder a new law, ministers can ignore the ECHR and direct officials to organise flights.\nCivil service union the First Division Association (FDA) wanted the High Court to rule on whether that element would put civil servants in a difficult legal position.\nBut in his ruling the judge said that while civil servants \u201cmust refuse\u201d to carry out ministerial instructions which are contrary to domestic law, there is no equivalent rule regarding international law.\n\u201cAny such rule would transform almost every obligation binding on the United Kingdom on the international plane into a domestic constraint on Ministerial action,\u201d the judge said.\nThe Safety of Rwanda legislation overruled last November's Supreme Court ruling that the country was not a safe place to send genuine refugees. \nIt also limited what kind of legal challenges people being deported to Rwanda could present to the courts. It empowered ministers to choose to ignore a temporary order from the ECHR  to halt flights while a case was still being considered.\nThe FDA feared civil servants could be stuck between judges and ministers and that a direction to breach international law would have put them in conflict with the Civil Service Code.\nFollowing the High Court decision, union general secretary Dave Penman said it was \"disappointing\" that the challenge was denied, but added that he welcomed \"clarity\" from the High Court.\nHe said: \"The court has ultimately decided that the then-government was explicit enough about the intent to break international law when passing the legislation, and that Parliament had indeed sanctioned that possibility. \n\"Clarity is what we were seeking and the court has provided that.\u201d\nIn his ruling, Mr Justice Chamberlain said no application to adjourn the case had been made in light of the general election being announced.\nHowever, it is unlikely that the ruling will be put into effect.

    "Thousands of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be offered a new 10-minute injection that can help slow progression of the disease, NHS England says.  \nThe medicine, called ocrelizumab, is normally given as an infusion through a vein - a process that can take up to four hours in hospital. \nThe new way to give the drug will help free up patients' and doctors' time, health chiefs say.\nOcrelizumab can help halt the symptoms of two forms of MS.\nThe under-the-skin injection has recently been approved by medicines regulators in Great Britain and Europe. \nMS affects more than 150,000 people in the UK, with some 135 people diagnosed each week.\nThe lifelong condition is caused by a person's immune system mistakenly attacking the protective covering that surrounds nerves in the brain and spinal cord.\nMessages travelling along the nerves may become slowed or disrupted.\nThis can lead to a range of problems including difficulties with eyesight, movement, sensation and balance, and it can cause serious disability. \nOcrelizumab (also known as ocrevus) which is given twice a year, targets a specific part of the immune system, helping to lessen the attack. \nIt can be used for two forms of the disease -  active relapsing MS and early primary progressive MS.  \nIn the most common, relapsing remitting type of MS, the disease waxes and wanes with episodes or flares where MS is active.\nIn other cases it be progressive, with symptoms gradually worsening. \nNin Sambhi, 39, from Staffordshire, was diagnosed with relapsing MS two years ago. \nShe currently takes the drug as an infusion but says the injection would make a significant difference to her, allowing her have more time with her young family. \n\"Ocrelizumab is working well for me right now and making me hopeful for a better and healthier future, but to be able to have an injection would be much more convenient to me,\" she said.\n\"At the moment it takes around four or five hours to have my infusion and the logistics can be really difficult. \n\"I have two children under 10, so sorting out childcare can be challenging.\"\nProf Sir Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said ocrelizumab had \"represented a huge advance in care in recent years\" as the first drug able to change the course of MS.\nHe added: \u201cThis new injection will drastically cut the time that regular treatment takes for those living with multiple sclerosis, meaning that thousands of patients can spend less time in hospital while helping free up clinicians\u2019 time to see more patients, as well as [provide] vital capacity on wards.\"\nThe MS Society charity welcomed the decision to license the injections and the greater choice patients will have about how they take their medication. \nOcrelizumab is manufactured by Roche, and was first approved in the UK in 2018. \nOther injectable treatments for relapsing MS include ofatumumab, which can be done by patients at home.

    "With just two weeks to go until the Paris 2024 Olympics begin, many Egyptians are debating the decision to select as a competitor a cyclist who collided with a rival team-mate who was knocked into a cement barrier.\nIn April, cyclist Ganna Eliwa, 19, was left concussed and with a broken right collarbone and severe cuts and bruises to the right-hand side of her body, according to a medical report, after she was pushed off her bike 300m (980ft) before the finishing line.\nIn video of the incident, her opponent, Shahd Saeed, also 19, is seen riding behind Eliwa before she swerves, forcing Eliwa into the barrier. The latter underwent an operation to fix her right shoulder, suffered temporary loss of memory and is still unable to resume her business.\nSaeed said a couple of times that it was an accident, but Eliwa says her opponent never apologised for what happened. It is unclear what caused Saeed to swerve into the other rider.\nAfter an investigation into the incident, the Egyptian Cycling Federation suspended Saeed from the sport for one year and fined her the equivalent of $100 (\u00a377) - the maximum penalty. Despite this, they still registered her name among the competitors in the Paris Olympics track cycling, causing public anger in Egypt.\nOn Facebook, users swarmed the account of the federation, appealing to it to strike Saeed\u2019s name off the list of competitors. One comment read: \u201cBest of luck to all participants except for the rider who pushed her colleague. She\u2019s not the best person to represent Egypt.\u201d\nEliwa also featured prominently on night-time talk shows, wishing Saeed bad luck.\n\u201cI hope she can take part in the Paris Olympics because I\u2019m pretty sure she would come last,\u201d she told one TV presenter.\nThe president of the Egyptian Cycling Federation said Saeed\u2019s participation in the Olympics was \u201cin favour of Egypt\u201d, noting that the organisation could not remove her because it was too late to replace her.\nMany commentators compared Saeed to Mohammed Ali Rashwan, an Egyptian judoka who prized fair play above a gold medal at the Los Angles Olympics in 1984.\n\"By refusing to attack his opponent\u2019s clearly injured right leg, the Egyptian judoka lost an obvious opportunity to be crowned Olympic champion, but instead he won worldwide acclaim and inner peace,\u201d some quoted the International Olympic Committee as saying about Rashwan.\nOthers said the choice of Saeed violated the three values of Olympism - excellence, respect and friendship - and urged authorities to reconsider their decision.\nPrompted by the criticism, the ministry of sports asked the Egyptian Olympic Committee to examine Saeed\u2019s participation in Paris 2024 in light of \u201cinternational accords and ethical rules\u201d.\nAfter maintaining a long silence under fire, Saeed told a local newspaper this incident was in the past, questioning why it was raised again before the games.\nShe again reiterated the incident was not \u201cdeliberate\u201d.\nCycling is not a popular sport in Egypt, but President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi frequently encourages men and women to get on their bikes. \nHe has been pictured numerous times leading hundreds of cyclists, including public figures, on a rally through Cairo at dawn.",

Hunter Biden was among the most vocal family members urging his father to remain in the race, CBS reported. \nBut as Democratic anxiety over the  81-year-old president's physical and mental stamina has spilled into public view in recent days, many inside the party have looked to the first lady for any hint of wavering over his candidacy. \nInstead, she has continued to hit the campaign trail, travelling to the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan this week for a string of political and official events.\n\"Because there's a lot of talk out there, let me repeat what my husband has said plainly and clearly: Joe is the Democratic nominee and he is going to beat Donald Trump, just like he did in 2020,\" Mrs Biden told supporters at a campaign event in Traverse City, Michigan, on Wednesday. \nMrs Biden's influence in the West Wing, however, is not unusual. \nNancy Kegan Smith, president of the First Ladies Association for Research and Education, said there are historic parallels between Mrs Biden and former first ladies.\n\"Most presidents depend on the uncoloured advice of their wives because that\u2019s the person who is normally closest to them,\u201d she said.\nShe pointed to Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of former President Lyndon B Johnson, who advised her husband - ultimately convincing him with a moving letter - to run for the White House in August 1964 after he became president following the assassination of John F Kennedy.\nFour years later in 1968, she changed her opinion, telling him to not run for re-election. He listened, Ms Kegan Smith said.\nMany in the Democratic Party are waiting to see if a similar scenario may unfold in the next month, placing a greater spotlight on Mrs Biden.\nThe first lady keeps a busy schedule. She is the first in the East Wing to keep a day job teaching English at a northern Virginia community college. When she is not teaching, she is often on the road campaigning for her husband.\n\u201cMost modern first ladies have been in the political game for quite a while and have been political sounding boards to their husbands,\u201d Katherine Jellison, an Ohio University professor who studies first ladies, told BBC News.\nThe president proposed five times before Mrs Biden said yes, and the couple married in 1977, five years after Mr Biden lost his first wife and daughter in a car crash that also injured his two sons.\nWhen he decided not to run for president in 2016, he told 60 Minutes \"it was the right decision for the family\". He cited his reasoning was in part because of the loss of his son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015. \nMrs Biden specifically played a role in her husband's decision not to run for president in 2003, Ms Kegan Smith said, pointing to a scene described in the first lady's 2019 memoir, Where the Light Enters. In the book, she recalled lounging by the pool as Democratic advisers inside encouraged her husband to launch a campaign. Wearing a bikini, she wrote \"no\" on her stomach in magic ma",
    "A small number of biomedical scientists are being investigated following fitness to practise concerns relating to cervical screening in the Southern Trust, BBC News NI understands.\nIn October 2023, it emerged smear tests of more than 17,000 women in the trust would be re-checked in a major review.\nIt is understood that some of the women affected have since referred the matter to the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), which investigates concerns about the practice of a professional on its register.\nThe HCPC does not share details or information about individual cases where there are ongoing investigations and legal processes.\nThe Southern Trust said it had not referred any scientists to the HCPC as there was \"insufficient information\" to do so before the end of the review.\nStella McLoughlin from Newry, who is one of the 17,500 women affected by the re-check, said the review process has left her feeling \u201cvery afraid, fragile, and angry\u201d.\n\"I don't know why they're calling it a review because to me this is a scandal. This has affected so many women,\" she said.\nFollowing news that other women in her position have referred the matter to the HCPC, she said there should be an investigation.\nDr Gabriel Scally, who led a 2018 review into cervical screening in the Republic of Ireland, said \"it is a significant step\" that the HCPC is carrying out an investigation.\n\"I think it's very sad that it's come to this because the saga of cervical screening and the way it has really failed the women of Northern Ireland,\" he said.\n\"It's about much, much more than just a couple of individuals whose screening performance in terms of looking at the slides is under question.\"\nDr Scally's view is that this should only be the \"beginning of a really thorough review of what went wrong with cervical screening and what is still wrong with cervical screening in Northern Ireland\".\nHe said the current review is taking \"far too long\" and that \"unnecessary\" and \"avoidable delays\" are not good in a screening system.\nDr Scally feels that there shouldn't just be a look at the screeners but at \"why poor performance was tolerated in Northern Ireland, why they didn't implement HPV [a new type of cervical screening, which Northern Ireland implemented years after England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland] and why we've still got a number of very small and potentially highly ineffective laboratories.\"\nStella McLoughlin, 69, had what should have been her last smear test in 2019.\nOnce women turn 65, they usually stop being invited for screening because it is very unlikely that they will get cervical cancer, and are only invited again if a recent test was abnormal.\nShe said she was \"really delighted\" to be told the results were clear and was \"enjoying life thinking everything was fine\", until she got a letter saying this was not the case.\nThe letter from the Southern Health Trust (SHT) said that her last smear test, which had been reported as negative, had been reviewed and now reported \"low grade cell changes\".\nIt went on to state that most low grade changes return to normal over time but a \"small proportion\" can progress. \nStella said the fact it had been five years since her last smear test \u201creally alarmed\" her and she now felt \"cheated\".\n\"I feel cheated because I was given a result five years ago that I trusted,\u201d she said.\nStella has had another smear test since but must wait up to six weeks for the result.\nThe trust says it has reviewed 97% of smear tests.\nIt had aimed to have all slides reviewed by the end of June, but said they are \"currently on track\" to be completed by the end of July.\nThe timeline for anyone who needs a repeat smear has also been delayed by several weeks until mid-September.\nThe trust said this was revised to account for annual leave and due to the impact of the implementation of Encompass digital records in the Belfast Trust, \"both of which incur system downtime\".\nWhile full results will not be available until the review is complete, the trust said the \"vast majority of previous smear results are unchanged and have been confirmed as normal\".\nIt said in a review of this size, it is expected that some abnormalities will be identified.\nTo date \"some low-grade abnormalities and a very small number (less than five) of higher-grade abnormalities have been found\".\nThe trust is keen to stress that this \"does not mean that cancer has been found\", but rather these women need \"further investigation and management as required\".\nAnyone can raise concerns with the HCPC: members of the public, patients / service users, employers, or other health and care professionals.",
    "German political figures have reacted angrily to a report that Russia had plotted to kill the head of Germany's biggest arms company Rheinmetall, Armin Papperger.\nThe CNN report said US officials had told their counterparts in Berlin earlier this year and security around him was stepped up.\nGermany's interior ministry refused to comment but Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock appeared to confirm the details.\n\"In view of latest reports on Rheinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months,\" she told reporters at the Nato summit in Washington. \"Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression.\"\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations. \"It's all presented in the style of another fake story, so such reports cannot be taken seriously.\"\nRheinmetall avoided commenting on issues of \"corporate security\", but Mr Papperger is now being described as the most highly protected figure in Germany's economy. He told the Financial Times that German authorities had imposed a \"great deal of security around my person\".\nThe company is one of the world's biggest producers of ammunition and has become key to supplying Ukraine with arms, armoured vehicles and other military equipment.\nRheinmetall recently opened a tank repair plant in western Ukraine. Last month, it signed an agreement with Ukraine to expand co-operation in the coming years, including a joint venture to produce artillery shells.\nMr Papperger said at the time his company wanted to hand over the first Lynx infantry fighting vehicles later this year and to start producing them in Ukraine soon.\nAlthough Chancellor Olaf Scholz avoided commenting on the reported assassination plot directly, he said it was well known that Germany was exposed to a variety of Russian threats and was paying close attention to them.\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser said \"we are taking very seriously the significantly heightened threat of Russian aggression\".\nEarlier this week, a senior Nato official told the BBC that Russia was \"engaging in aggressive covert operations across Europe \u2013 involving sabotage, arson and assassination plots \u2013 aimed at weakening public support for Ukraine\".\nThe German foreign minister said the Baltic states had already highlighted the various methods deployed by Russia's Vladimir Putin in his war on Ukraine. As well as sabotage, she spoke of cyberattacks and disrupting GPS signals so that Baltic flights could no longer land in neighbouring countries.\n\"We have seen that there have been attacks on factories, and that again underlines that, together, we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,\" Ms Baerbock told reporters.\nIn early May, a building complex owned by the Diehl Metall firm went up in flames in south-west Berlin. Although a technical fault was blamed for the fire, sabotage has not been ruled out. Suspicious fires have also been reported in Poland and Lithuania.\nLast April, Mr Papperger's garden house was set alight at Hermannsburg in northern Germany, although there has been no evidence of a Russian link.\nThe fire was quickly brought under control and a rambling, anonymous confession purportedly from leftist militants appeared on activist network Indymedia. \nThe reported plot against such a high-profile German CEO has prompted widespread alarm.\nLeading conservative figure Roderich Kiesewetter said the chancellor should come clean with the German population about how great the threat from Russia really was. German intelligence needed to be boosted to the level of neighbouring countries, he said.\n\"We must take it very seriously and also prepare ourselves accordingly,\" he told public broadcaster ZDF.\nMichael Roth, who chairs Germany's foreign affairs committee told Bild newspaper that Vladimir Putin was waging a \"war of extermination not only against Ukraine, but against its supporters and our values\". \nThe head of the defence committee, Marcus Faber, added his condemnation, saying if information about Russian intelligence involvement came to light, then \"the expulsion of diplomats must follow and, if necessary, international arrest warrants must be issued\".",
    "Senator Fatima Payman has resigned from Australia's ruling Labor Party, days after voting against it to support a motion on Palestinian statehood.\nLabor has strict penalties for those who undermine its policy positions, and Ms Payman was already \u201cindefinitely suspended\u201d from the party\u2019s caucus after vowing to do it again.\n\u201cThis is a matter I cannot compromise on,\u201d the 29-year-old said on Thursday, adding that she was \u201cdeeply torn\u201d over the decision.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ms Payman had thanked him for his leadership and denied allegations she had been intimidated into quitting.\nMs Payman will now join the crossbench as an independent senator.\nThe 29-year-old Muslim lawmaker, whose family fled Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban in 1996, is Australia\u2019s first and only hijab-wearing federal politician.\n\u201cUnlike my colleagues, I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of injustice. My family did not flee a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,\u201d she said during a press conference on her resignation.\nThe conflict in Gaza has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all sides have sought to carefully manage.\nOfficially the government favours a two-state solution, but it did not back the motion on statehood after trying - and failing - to insert a condition that any recognition should be \u201cas part of a peace process\u201d.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed, and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 28 over the past 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nMs Payman said that since crossing the Senate floor to vote with the Greens party last Tuesday she had received \u201cimmense support\u201d from some colleagues, and \u201cpressure\u2026 to toe the party line\u201d from others. She also reported receiving \"death threats and emails that were quite confronting\" from members of the public. \nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese, who handed down the indefinite suspension on Sunday, had repeatedly said Ms Payman could rejoin the caucus \u2013 where MPs discuss the government\u2019s agenda - if she was willing to participate \u201cas a team player\u201d.\nBut in a statement earlier this week, Ms Payman said she had been \u201cexiled\u201d by Labor - explaining that she had been removed from meetings, group chats and all committees.",
    "Fans across England erupted into celebrations as they watched Ollie Watkins' 90th minute winner in Wednesday's semi-final against the Netherlands.\nFor many, this tournament might be the first time they have heard the striker's name, but supporters in Weston-super-Mare have long been a fan of Watkins after his stint at the town's football club a decade ago. \nHis legacy still has a huge impact on people in the town. Below, a few of his friends and former colleagues describe what he was like, and what his rise to fame means to them. \n\nThe striker, originally from Devon, was playing in the English Football League just over four years ago, when he was 24.\nNow with Aston Villa, he is fondly remembered at Weston-super-Mare after his season with the club, when he was on loan from Exeter.\nDan Jackson was in the team at Weston-super-Mare at the same time. \nNow working as a PE teacher at Kings Oak Academy in Bristol, he describes the striker as \"humble\", who comes across as \"incredibly dedicated\" and \"very likeable\".\nMr Jackson told the BBC: \"When he came in, he didn't come across as big time or any different. He wanted to get stuck in and just be a part of the group really. \n\"He saw it as a way of taking the next step.\"\nAs a schoolteacher, his pupils now know he played with Ollie Watkins.\n\"Young people, they look up to him - it's an inspirational journey they've seen somebody go on.\n\"It shows that if you work hard and are dedicated anything is possible,\" he said.\nThe teacher said he was \"buzzing\" when the goal happened.\nHe said: \"In the moment, it was instinct for him, but it was pretty special thinking he was associated with Weston.\"\nMr Jackson is pleased that Watkins talks about his \"roots\" in media interviews. \n\"I think going through non-league, it keeps you resilient because you need to learn to have a living and he's been there,\" Mr Jackson said.\nAt Weston's football club, there are signed Ollie Watkins shirts framed on the wall.\nThe club's managing director, Oli Bliss, said: \"It just seems so strange. Ten years ago he was here playing for us and then doing that in the semi-final for England.\" \nHe said Watkins was \"very level-headed, great attitude, good work ethic\".\nWatkins was \"good to have around the place\" and would take the time to talk to the supporters and children, Mr Bliss added.\n\nWatkins had only played 20 minutes at a major tournament before his goal on Wednesday.\nWhen Watkins was on the bench, he felt he could make a difference to the game if manager Gareth Southgate played him. \nHe said: \"I took my chance, scored it and now we are in the final. One last game.\"\n\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X. Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630.",
    "Campaigners fearful of toxic waste leaking from a former landfill site have called on the council to publish the results of monitoring tests.\nStoneyhill, near Telford, was used by the former international chemical company Monsanto between 1985 and 1991.\nVicar turned citizen scientist Paul Cawthorne has called for transparency and \"more accountability\" over testing at the site.\nTelford and Wrekin Council said it was not contaminated land and while regular testing took place throughout the year, none of the results gave \"cause for concern\".\nHowever, it has refused to release its results to either the BBC or campaigners.\nMonsanto ceased trading in 2016, but tests done on another of the firm's former sites found levels of now-banned chemicals more than 12,000 times higher than the recommended UK levels.\nA stream runs through the former landfill at Stoneyhill and down into Coalbrookdale and on into the River Severn.\nThe soil and water in the stream is bright orange, but both the Environment Agency and Telford and Wrekin Council say it is caused by iron contamination from former mines that litter the area.\n\"For years I\u2019ve been asking for the results of tests done here to be made public,\" Mr Cawthorne said.\n\"Hopefully there\u2019s nothing here but when people withhold results, then you wonder what they\u2019re trying to hide.\"\nThe former landfill was used to dispose of industrial, commercial and household waste, as well as animal carcasses.\nMonsanto used it to bury industrial waste from their factories in South Wales.\nCampaigners' fears have been prompted by the use of so-called \"forever chemicals\" used in paint and other household products at the time.\nIn high doses, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substances (PFAs) have been linked to serious health concerns including cancer and fertility issues.\nThey are now banned by 151 countries.\nPat McCarthy, the Green Party co-ordinator for the area, said: \"The worry is we\u2019re talking about chemicals that live forever in the environment. \n\"We already know that they can damage organs within the body. \n\"We will find out, I'm absolutely certain, that the accumulation of these chemicals will have serious consequences.\n\"All we want is for the authorities to test regularly and show us the results. If there\u2019s nothing there we've got nothing to worry about.\"\nLocal resident Sarah Robinson said her dog Dylan became ill after drinking the water at Coalbrookdale.\n\"He drank from the water as it was coming down from the stream and he was sick with diarrhoea, severe diarrhoea for 24 hours. We were very worried about him,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s been like this since my childhood. It\u2019s been cleaned out from time to time and after that the water does get cleaner.\n\"It\u2019s really concerning. I don\u2019t let Dylan go near the water any more.\"\nThe BBC submitted a freedom of information request to Telford and Wrekin Council,  which confirmed it monitored the site regularly, including for PCBs and PFAs.\nIt refused to release its data, but in a statement said: \"Continuous monitoring and regular testing takes place throughout the year, both on site and beyond as part of the active management of the site. \n\"Of all the testing results collated to date, none has presented any cause for concern. \n\"We have been completely open about how we manage the site including what and how we test.\"\nThe local authority owns the site, although it belonged to Shropshire County Council at the time it was in active use.\nThe Environment Agency (EA) has found very low levels of toxic chemicals in a ditch near Stoneyhill, but said it also has no cause for concern. \nIt also tested nearby streams in 2017 and 2018 and said the water quality was good, but those tests did not include ones for forever chemicals.\nAs part of a BBC investigation into forever chemicals, the Royal Society of Chemistry tested land near other former Monsanto sites.\nOn a public path at Helsby in Cheshire, a scientist found the highest level of the banned chemical he had ever recorded in soil anywhere in the world.\nThe sample of mud contained PCBs more than 12,000 times over the recommended UK level and was off the maximum scale of calibration for the equipment.\nDespite that, the local authority has not registered the former landfill site as \"contaminated land\".\nFurther tests at former Monsanto sites in South Wales returned levels between four and 150 times higher than the UK background level of PCBs.\nRegarding the situation at Stoneyhill, the EA said it \"supports local authorities to identify and investigate contaminated sites where appropriate and they'll work with appropriate persons to reduce unacceptable risks to human health and the environment.\"\nThe water is then treated before being discharged into the river.

    "A diabetic woman was \"crying on her bed\" after she stopped taking insulin during a slapping therapy workshop run by an alternative healer, a court has been told.\nDanielle Carr-Gomm, 71, died in October 2016 while taking part in a workshop in Wiltshire which promoted Paida Lajin therapy, which sees patients being slapped or slapping themselves repeatedly.\nProsecutor Duncan Atkinson told Winchester Crown Court Mrs Carr-Gomm had been seen to be \u201cvomiting, tired and weak\u201d and had been \u201chowling in pain\u201d.\nThe leader of the workshop, Hongchi Xiao, 61, of Cloudbreak, California, denies manslaughter by gross negligence.\nMr Atkinson said the 30 people attending the workshop at Cleeve House in Seend were \"keen disciples\" of the defendant, who was described as Master Xiao in the programme for the event.\nHe said Ms Carr-Gomm, from Lewes in East Sussex, had sought alternatives to her insulin medication because of her fear of needles, and she had described Mr Xiao as a \"messenger sent by God\".\nMr Atkinson said participants fasted for several days, only consumed Chinese tea and signed a disclaimer form which stated the practice was not \"meant for medical treatment\".\nMrs Carr-Gomm had Type 1 diabetes, meaning she had to take insulin every day to keep her blood glucose levels under control. \nBut Mr Atkinson told the court that she announced on the first day of the workshop that she had stopped taking her insulin, which Mr Xiao \u201ccongratulated\u201d her on.\n\u201cHe did nothing to alert others to the risk. He simply congratulated her and allowed a Type 1 diabetic to commence fasting without insulin,\" he added.\nMr Atkinson said other participants interpreted Mrs Carr-Gomm's deteriorating condition as a \"healing crisis\" - a term used by the defendant as the process of the Paida Lajin taking effect.\nThe prosecutor said the decision to intervene had to come from the defendant as the participants \"relied on him and his interpretation of what was happening\".\nMr Atkinson said her condition worsened in the early hours of the Thursday -  four days after she had stopped taking insulin - and she died of diabetic ketoacidosis.\nHe told the court Mrs Carr-Gomm's life could have been saved if she had received medical care, including the administration of insulin, and \"no-one was better placed\" than the defendant\" to \"make sure that this happened.\"\nIn an interview after he was arrested, the court was also told Mr Xiao had believed Mrs Carr-Gomm was weak from fasting and had not needed an ambulance.\nMr Atkinson said Mr Xiao had written a book which contained messages which \"very clearly\" showed the defendant \"viewed drugs such as insulin as poisons\" and that his own methods \"should be effective on almost all diseases\".\nDefending, Charles Row told the jury the defendant denied having a duty of care over Mrs Carr-Gomm and he had made it \"absolutely clear\" to her he was not medically trained.\nHe said Mr Xiao had told her not to stop taking her insulin and Ms Carr-Gomm \"was a law unto herself, a strong, driven and independent woman.\"\nMr Row added that the defendant claimed his actions were not causative of Ms Carr-Gomm's death.\n\u201cThe degree of influence he had over Danielle Carr-Gomm is very much an issue, as is the question of whether he assumed responsibility for her safety,\" Mr Row said.\nThe trial continues. \nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Edinburgh businesses have said the city cannot cope with another summer of strikes by bin collectors like the one which left rubbish piled on the streets two years ago.\nDaniela Scott, who runs her father's Italian restaurant on Edinburgh's Royal Mile, said she felt \"sick to her stomach\" when unions announced plans to strike during the Edinburgh Festival in August.\n\"It is embarrassing for tourists to come over to Scotland's most famous street and it's stinking and nobody wants to be sat next to rubbish while they eat,\" the 39-year-old said.\n\"They need to stop the strike. They need to think about the city, especially the Royal Mile, it is one of the biggest tourist streets in the world. It's where Edinburgh Castle is.

It's such a beautiful city, why is it so messy?'\n\"There were piles and piles of rubbish and a lot of stench because of the weather at that time. \n\"It was very unsightly and people couldn't understand how come a World Heritage Site was in such a bad state.\"\nMr Singh Gold said his customers were shocked and disappointed because they were expecting to find the beautiful Edinburgh that is portrayed in the pictures online.\n\"It did leave a very negative impact,\" he said.\n\"We were having to jump over the rubbish while we were making our deliveries and the stench was terrible.\"\n\"If it happens again it's just going to be another nail in the coffin for the image and reputation of Edinburgh.\"\nTom Ponton, owner of the Oz Bar in Edinburgh's Grassmarket, said his heart sank when he heard another strike was being planned.\n \"The last strike during the festival was a disgrace,\" he said. \n\"It was a health hazard.\n\"We were wading through overloaded bins with everything, including food, coming out of them.\n\"There were rats raiding all through them and stray cats jumping all over them.\"\nMr Ponton said it was unbelievable that workers would be striking again at the most inconvenient time for the city.\n\"It's the capital city and biggest arts festival in the world and we have got to deal with this?,\" he said.\nEdinburgh branch secretary of Unite, Brian Robertson, said members did \"not want to make a mess of the festival\" and urged the Scottish government to come to the table and find a solution to prevent it from happening again.\n\"It's about local government pay for the whole of Scotland,\" he said.\n\"These brave workers will be coming out on strike, losing wages, unless the Scottish government comes to the table and we can negotiate with them and with Cosla to get a decent pay rise for all local government workers in Scotland.\n\"The vast majority of local government workers earn far less than the median wage in this city - many of them are working on less than \u00a320,000 a year.\"\nA Cosla spokesperson said it had made a strong offer which was at the limits of affordability for councils.\n\"We are disappointed that industrial action is being contemplated by our unions and concerned that it appears to be targeted at waste services, once again raising potential public health risks,\" they said.",

    "A tribunal has found a doctor's fitness to practise to be impaired after he sent racist messages over WhatsApp.\nDoctor Mohammad Sohail had accepted a police caution for the content at Solihull Police Station in 2020.\nAt a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) hearing, Dr Sohail was unable to explain what he meant by his \"extremely offensive\" words about black people that he sent to a black woman. \nThe MPTS imposed a 10-month suspension on Dr Sohail's medical licence at a hearing on Tuesday.\nDr Sohail was a practising consultant at Fairfield Hospital in Manchester and worked in aesthetics and intensive care, the MPTS said.\nAt the hearing, Dr Sohail reiterated his apology to the victim of his messaging and told the tribunal he was ashamed and saddened by his actions.\nHe claimed to have not acted in the same manner before or since the events of May 2020, over which he received a police caution later that year.\nWhile he was unable to explain what he had meant by his language, he told the tribunal he was not trying to degrade the victim and that he held no hostility towards black people or any other race.\nHe also said he did not discriminate and treated all people fairly.\nRepresenting the General Medical Council (GMC), Georgina Goring reminded the tribunal that Dr Sohail had admitted to sending harassing messages that were racially aggravated and that this was clearly misconduct.\nShe submitted that Dr Sohail had not reflected upon the racial aspects of the messages and had offered no understanding of whether these were beliefs that he held or whether he had done anything to change them.\nThe tribunal considered Dr Sohail\u2019s evidence that he had been racially abused by the recipient of the messages in a phone call shortly before he sent them, however it had no evidence of the call or its content.\nFurthermore, the tribunal found that even if he had been verbally or otherwise abused by the recipient, it was no excuse for the \"extremely offensive\" language he used towards her.\nThere was also concern that Dr Sohail had stated his actions were \"revenge\" on the recipient and that he showed some self pity over the situation in which he found himself.\nThe tribunal additionally noted that Dr Sohail had previously received a caution for common assault and a subsequent warning from the GMC in relation to an altercation with a female friend in 2014.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The UK's last remaining coal-fired power station is entering its final days.\nThe plant at Ratcliffe-on Soar, Nottinghamshire, is a prominent landmark for rail passengers on the Midland Main Line and M1 traffic passing close by.\nIt began generating electricity 57 years ago - in 1967 - with a capacity of 2,000 megawatts, enough to power two million homes.\nHowever, it will close on 30 September as part of government plans to end coal production in the UK.\nCoal once dominated the East Midlands region, with the Ratcliffe power station at its heart.\nHowever, just as the coal mines have closed, now the UK's last coal-fired power station will cease production this autumn.\nCoal is a fossil fuel and has been generating electricity in Britain since the Industrial Revolution, but it is now known for its impact on the environment.\nWhen coal burns, it releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.\nOver time, the build-up of those gases has increased global temperatures, by trapping extra energy in the Earth's atmosphere.\nThe European Union ranked Ratcliffe as the continent's 18th most polluting power plant in 2008.\nThe UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050.\nTo help achieve that target, the UK government has said it wants to achieve fully \"clean\" electricity by 2035, by rapidly increasing wind, solar, and nuclear power.\nAt the turn of the 20th Century, coal was used to generate over 95% of energy consumed in the UK. By 2023, that had fallen to just 1%.\nIn a landmark moment, GB Railfreight delivered what is likely to be the plant's final coal shipment on Friday.\nThe 1,650-tonne delivery is enough coal to generate electricity for approximately 500,000 homes for an eight-hour period.\nIt is the last batch of more than six million tonnes of coal transported to the site from the Port of Immingham in Lincolnshire.\nTo mark the end of the line, operator GB Railfreight named the locomotive Ratcliffe Power Station.\nThe company says each of its trains can carry the equivalent load of up to 129 lorries.\nThe owner of the power station - international energy company Uniper - says it hopes the site could become a zero-carbon technology and energy hub.\nThe firm already has its Technology Centre at Ratcliffe-on-Soar, where it carries out research and development on power generation.\nThe site has a Local Development Order (LDO) in place, granted by Rushcliffe Borough Council in 2023.\nThe council said its decision to simplify the planning permission process could fast-track development once the power station closes.\nAt the time, Neil Clarke, the Conservative leader of the council, said the LDO could help to create an estimated 7,000 jobs.\nMike Lockett, from Uniper, said: \"We're also exploring the potential for future hydrogen production at the site.\"\nDecommissioning at the Ratcliffe plant will start on 1 October, immediately after power production finishes, and take two years to complete.\nUniper says 125 of its staff will stay on to help close it down.\nDemolition of the cooling towers and the rest of the 655-acre site will only happen once decommissioning is complete.\nThe council said it would limit the amount of development before road access improvements were made, to ensure local roads could cope with increased traffic.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

I've dreamt about this my whole life'.\nMr Nurden said his doctor allowed him to postpone surgery for three months as he believed the tumour was benign.\nMr Nurden said he remembered feeling it was an \"incredible\" reprieve, but three weeks after surgery he \"got the dreaded phone call from my doctor that no-one is ever prepared for, to say 'you have cancer'\".\nHe added: \"It was one of the darkest, hardest, toughest periods ever in my life that I had to go through - an open surgery to remove half my lung.\n\"But whilst I was going through everything, my burning desire to still perform in the West End has always been there.\"\nMr Nurden was supported by the Actors' Benevolent Fund charity and is now clear of cancer.\nHe said: \"The ultimate goal now is to really get strong, fighting fit and audition and hopefully, hopefully, get back into the West End one day.\"\nIn 2020, the results of a large-scale systematic review were published, which suggested that delaying cancer surgery might increase the chance of death from the illness.\nA study by researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, King\u2019s College London and Queen\u2019s University, Canada, suggests a four-week delay in treating some cancers could result in a 10% increase in the risk of dying.\nClaire Taylor, chief nursing officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: \u201cWhen diagnosed and treated early, it\u2019s more likely that cancer will be successfully treated. \n\"But everyone\u2019s experience with cancer is personal to them and the care people receive should revolve around their own health needs, who they are and what they need to manage their treatment well.\"\nShe added: \u201cFollowing a cancer diagnosis there can be a lot to get your head around and we\u2019d urge anyone who has concerns or questions about their treatment to speak to their medical team to understand the benefits and risks of different options and work out the best route for them.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Five years ago, the last general election was about Brexit. It was called to break the impasse at Westminster on how to \"get Brexit done\" and that became the then Prime Minister's slogan.\nBoris Johnson had, you may recall, an \"oven-ready Brexit\". And he got the majority he required to put it in the legislative cooker.\nBut it was far from being \"oven ready\". \nThe key elements of the trade partnership deal were yet to be hammered out.\nThe price paid by the British to get a deal was a nasty shock to several sectors of the economy, from car-makers to farmers, whose post-EU subsidy regime remains uncertain. Trading food remains more difficult.\nThe price paid by the economy has been hard to quantify, because other factors have been a powerful drag on performance, notably the pandemic and the price inflation that followed.\nSo, eight years after the referendum and five years on from the Brexit election...\nWatching the election campaign unfold over the past six weeks, you wouldn't know Brexit has been one of the most profound changes to affect Britain in decades. \nBoth the Conservative and Labour parties have judged it to be against their interests to go strong on the issue.\nThey believe people have made up their minds about it. Brexit dredges up divisions within their parties and alienates some voters, whatever the candidates say.\nThe issue is a reminder of some of the Tories\u2019 more chaotic times in office, as well as pro-Brexit promises that crumbled to nothing much. From repatriated funds for spending on the NHS to British control of fishing grounds.\nMany 'Leave' voters remain loyal to the cause and live in northern English constituencies which Labour hopes to win back from Tories, so the party is trying not to alienate them with negative messages about Brexit.\nOther 'Leave' voters agree with the argument put forward by the Reform Party that Brexit was not done properly and the trading deal with the EU should be re-negotiated. \nOn the free-market right of politics, some wish the Liz Truss experiment with tax-cutting had been better executed, because they thought Brexit would create the conditions for a radically different type of state.\nLabour has chosen to avoid a fight with Tories about Brexit. It's done, says the party, and it's pragmatic to accept that. Labour is against re-joining the European Union, the single market or the customs union.\nTories want to \"seize the benefits of Brexit\" by signing further trade deals, speeding up infrastructure and \"unblocking 100,000 homes, cutting red tape for business, and creating new fishing opportunities\".\nThey want to repeal or reform EU regulations on the statute book. Having given up on a plan to repeal them all at once, they want the process to be half-way completed within two years.\nThey talk of the freedom to vary VAT rates, which is not allowed inside the EU. This would lead to lower rates for beer served in pubs and low-carbon home improvements.\nApart from being less interested in trade deals beyond the EU, Sir Keir Starmer's party wants similar outcomes; to boost growth with fewer planning obstacles. However, it doesn't see Brexit as the key to getting them.\nIt wants to negotiate better trading arrangements, removing barriers, form-filling, cost and delays. These could affect trade in food, with an agreement on veterinary checks on meat. \nThat, however, gets trickier if the UK is opening up to new markets through new trade deals being struck elsewhere.\nLabour also wants to agree mutual recognition of professional qualifications. That way, an engineer or dentist, for instance, could work in either the UK or EU.\nWhile business representatives are broadly supportive, many want to go further, including opening the doors to more migrant workers.\nIn contrast, the SNP has been keen to raise the Brexit issue, with a pledge to re-join as soon as an independent Scotland is able. \nThe party claims that if the whole UK re-joined, it could unlock sufficient extra growth in the economy to generate \u00a330bn more in tax revenue.\nLib Dems have set EU membership as a goal for the longer term. In the shorter term, they want to renegotiate the Brexit deal signed with the European Commission to ease the terms of trade.\nThey share with the SNP the aim of re-opening cross-border educational links for young people. A recent offer from Brussels to talk about this was rejected by both the Tories and Labour.\nMeanwhile, the Brexit deal and trading arrangements in the subsequent Windsor Agreement between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland have been a prominent part of this election campaign in the province.\nLabour hopes to open a more positive dialogue with EU members and the commission to get concessions that would ease up trade frictions. The SNP wants to start talks on re-joining.\nAs we learned from the Brexit process, it isn't as simple as declaring what one side wants and expects to get in a negotiation. The other side would have its own demands and foremost among them is likely to be f",
    "Two French international rugby players have been charged with the aggravated rape of a woman following a match in Argentina, prosecutors in the South American country say. \nHugo Auradou, 20, and Oscar Jegou, 21, are accused of raping a 39-year-old woman after France beat Argentina on Saturday. \nShe alleges that they raped her multiple times and beat her in a hotel room in the city of Mendoza. \nThe pair, who chose \"not to testify\" at a hearing in the city, say they had consensual sex with the woman and deny rape. They will remain in custody while authorities investigate further. \nWarning: this story contains details that some readers may find upsetting\nThe woman alleged the attack took place at the Diplomatic Hotel, where France's players and staff were staying as part of a tour of South America. \nHer lawyer says she left a nightclub with one of the men and accompanied him to the hotel room, where she alleges that she was raped \"at least six times\" by one of the men and once by the other. \nMs Romano told AFP that her client suffered \"fierce\" violence, with injuries to her face, back, breasts, legs and ribs as well as various bite and scratch marks.\nThe woman was held against her will for several hours and tried to escape several times, Ms Romano said.\nHer client went to hospital on Thursday after feeling ill emotionally and physically because of the incident and is receiving treatment at a health facility, she added.\nOn Friday a lawyer for the players said his clients were confident in their version of events.\n\"They are well and sure of their version, they are calm because they know they are innocent, but of course they are worried about this whole situation that they have had to live through,\" German Hnatow told reporters.\nOn Wednesday another lawyer said the \"sexual relations\" had been consensual. \n\"There are witnesses who saw her leave [the hotel]. There are cameras that saw her leave.  Apparently no injuries are seen in the footage,\" Mariano Cuneo Libarona told journalists. \nFrench Rugby Federation (FFR) president Florian Gill, who is in Argentina, also told AFP that the players had \"quite a different version of events\". \n\"We are not judges. We are not investigators. But we think that the Argentine justice system should look at the case very quickly,\" he said.\nMr Auradou and Mr Jegou have been replaced by lock Mickael Guillard and flanker Judicael Cancoriet for Saturday's second match against Argentina in Buenos Aires.",
    "Truro City Football Club's new ground will be finished in time for the new season, its developers have said.\nTruro City have not had a permanent home since leaving their Treyew Road ground in 2021.\nThe club and its long-suffering fans have had to endure a nomadic existence since then.\nBut the new 3,000-seater stadium should be ready for the start of the National League South season in August.\nThe new Truro City stadium is part of the massive Langarth Garden Village development, which will see 4,000 homes, a new access road and other community facilities built on Truro's western edge.\nHarry Lewis is the Langarth Garden Village project director for Cornwall Council\u2019s development company Treveth.\nHe said: \u201cThe main point is Truro City needs to be playing football here in September which they\u2019re going to do. That\u2019s on.\n\"The pitch is in and preliminary stands. But, as the master developers, we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do with the owners of Truro City Football Club, which is going on in the background.\"\nTruro City have been without a home since 2021 when the Treyew Road ground was sold for development.\nSince then, they've played their home games in Plymouth, Torquay and Taunton, and secured promotion to the National League South in 2023.\nFor many years, Truro City were hopeful the Stadium for Cornwall project would provide them with a base in the city.\nBut, when that dream came to an acrimonious end in June 2022, negotiations started between the football club and the team behind the Langarth Garden Village concept.\nThose negotiations led to the Truro Sports Hub, which is being built on the land earmarked for the old Stadium for Cornwall.\nThe Hub will feature an all-weather floodlit 3G pitch for use by the local community, as well as the Truro City stadium.\nA planning application for a permanent club house and more community facilities is expected in the coming months, once the funding is secured. \nCornwall Council portfolio holder for housing Olly Monk said:  \"What you see here is fantastic for fans of Truro City and football fans throughout Cornwall as well. \n\"It provides a 21st Century facility, but, importantly, it opens up the door for 4,000 homes, over 30% of which will be affordable, and give access to local people to get on the housing ladder.\u201d\nThe National League South season kicks off on Saturday 10 August - the fixtures are released a month before then.\nWhenever Truro City play at home for the first time, it will be a new start in a number of different ways.\nThere will be a new manager in the dugout, as former Macclesfield Town, York City and Port Vale boss John Askey replaces Paul Wotton.\nIt is the first time chairman Eric Perez can watch a home game at home, since buying the club last November.\nThe club even has a new crest and nickname, with The Tinners replacing The White Tigers. \nBut, for the fans, the main focus will be of building a successful team, rather than building a home stadium for that team to play in. \nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Wales First Minister Vaughan Gething has insisted he is getting on with the job, despite a continuing row over his sacking of a minister and criticism of controversial donations to his leadership campaign.\nHe said there was evidence a photograph of Hannah Blythyn's phone had been sent to a website which published the story that triggered her dismissal.\nNation.Cymru used the picture to reveal that Mr Gething had said he was deleting messages from a chat group full of ministers in August 2020, during the pandemic.\nHe appeared before a Senedd committee on Friday, in a tense exchange with opposition members which saw the first minister raise his voice when interrupted.\nA day after Nation.Cymru said Ms Blythyn was not the source of the story, Mr Gething told the committee he had never suggested she had contacted the website directly, only that it was a photograph of her phone.\n\"I've never tried to claim that Hannah Blythyn directly contacted Nation.Cymru,\" he said.\n\"I'm very clear, because I had it confirmed, that a photograph of her phone was provided to Nation.Cymru.\"\nMr Gething said it was \"hard for me to constantly have people question my integrity\", and that he always tried to do the \"right thing\u201d, \u201cincluding when it's difficult for me personally\".\n\"That is what I'm doing again,\" he said.  \"And yet here we are, with more questions and more suggestions, that go to the heart of integrity and decency.\n\"And yet the government is getting on with the job.\"\nThe first minister gave the legislative programme he announced in the Senedd this week, the resolution of the pay dispute with hospital doctors, and his meeting with new Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Monday, as examples.\nHe was addressing the committee for the scrutiny of the first minister, which is made up of Senedd committee chairs and met on Friday at Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire.\nPlaid Cymru MS Llyr Gruffydd said there \"remain two conflicting accounts\" about the alleged leaked messages and accused Mr Gething of \"side-stepping important questions\". \n\u201cIt was somewhat ironic that in the scrutiny session of the first minister, Vaughan Gething did everything possible to avoid scrutiny,\" he said.\nConservative group leader Andrew RT Davies called on the first minister to \"release the evidence he relied upon to dismiss Hannah Blythyn from his government\".\n\u201cThe people of Wales cannot be expected to simply take him at his word,\" he said.\nAdditional reporting by Aled Scourfield",
    "Archaeologists excavating the area around an historic stone formation believe a man-made ring of stones, known as a stone circle, may have been found at the site.\nArthur's Stone in Dorstone, Herefordshire, is said to mark the spot where King Arthur slew a giant.\nProfessor of archaeology at The University of Manchester Julian Thomas said a survey had shown up a circle about 20m (65.6ft) across that seemed to \"not be of natural origin\".\nTours around Arthur's Stone will take place over the coming weeks for people wanting to see this year's excavations.\nExperts from English Heritage and the University of Manchester have previously said Arthur's Stone was one of the country's most significant prehistoric monuments.\nSlabs set in the hills above Herefordshire's Golden Valley form a 5,000-year-old Neolithic burial chamber, formed by nine upright stones with a capstone on top.\nIt has informed legends, with indentations on its surface said to have been made as the giant fell backwards after being slain by King Arthur.\nProf Thomas said when work started at Arthur's Stone, a trench was opened up \"the other side of the hedge from the monument\".\nHe added: \"[We] found that there are further prehistoric features there, so we've got an avenue which starts out as an avenue of timbers and is replaced by an avenue of stones. \n\"[This] runs down the hill from the monument itself and as a response to that, we conducted further surveys.\"\nProf Thomas said one thing it showed up was a circle, which \"looks like it's perhaps a barrow or a timber circle or a stone circle\".\nBut it was \"certainly something made by human beings\" and about half of that was now being opened up, with a stone circle thought to be the most likely outcome.\nThere were plenty of stone circles in Scotland and Wales, but \"not so many\" in Herefordshire and the West Midlands, he said, \"so it would be a really exciting find if we've got one here\".\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The leader of a black and minority ethnic women's organisation has criticised what she called an \"institutionally racist system\" after an assault case against her was dropped.\nSelma Taha, 52, the executive director of Southall Black Sisters, had been due to stand trial along with her friends Divina Riggon, 42, and Danae Thomas, 53, having been charged with assaulting a woman in Kings Cross Underground station last year.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the case as the three-day trial was set to start, saying it was unlikely to lead to a conviction.\nMs Taha said she and her friends had been the victims of a violent racist attack and they had been \"disbelieved and criminalised\" for challenging the abuse.\nThe three women were accused of assault by beating following the incident at the London Underground station on 29 September last year.\nMs Riggon was also charged with harassment and Ms Thomas was accused of racially aggravated harassment, but those charges were also dropped at a hearing at Highbury Magistrates' Court.\nAbout 40 supporters cheered and waved placards as the trio left the court building raising their arms aloft.\nOutside the court, Ms Taha shed tears as she said: \"As relieved as I am about the decision being in our favour, this has been hard-fought and I continue to feel aggrieved at the treatment my sisters and I have received.\n\u201cFrom being subjected to vile racist slurs and significant injuries on public transport in the presence of an off-duty police officer... to being disbelieved and criminalised by the CPS for challenging the racist abuse, the past 10 months have reaffirmed my lack of faith in the system.\"\nShe added that the episode had \"served as a daily reminder of the challenges we are up against as black, minoritised and migrant victim-survivors seeking a just response from an institutionally racist system\".\nFollowing the alleged incident, Ms Taha told BBC London she had been racially abused, bitten and had her hair pulled out during an altercation on a Tube train. \nShe also claimed an off-duty police officer had been sitting nearby at the time and failed to immediately identify himself.\nBarrister Rajiv Menon KC, representing Ms Taha and Ms Thomas, said the \"prosecution should never have been brought\".\n\"Danae, Selma and Divina were victims of a racist attack on the Tube and whilst this kind of prosecution was extremely common 20, 30, 40 years ago, it should not be happening any more in 2024, it is an outrage,\" he added.\nIt is understood that the complainant in the case had previously accepted a caution for racially aggravated conduct under the Public Order Act and no further action was taken.\nA CPS spokesperson said: \"We have a duty to keep all cases under continuous review and following information received in the past few days, we decided that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction, and these charges were discontinued.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The UK economy grew faster than expected in May helped by a strong performance from retailers and the construction industry.\nThe economy expanded by 0.4%, rebounding from zero growth in April when wet weather put off shoppers and slowed down building projects.\nConstruction grew at the fastest rate in almost a year in May, with house building and infrastructure projects boosting the industry, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nAnalysts said the new figures, together with recent comments from Bank of England policymakers, meant the decision on whether interest rates will be cut next month was on a \"knife-edge\". \nMay's growth figure was double what was expected. Liz McKeown, of the ONS, said that many retailers and wholesalers \"had a good month, with both bouncing back from a weak April\".\nThe services sector, which dominates the UK economy and covers businesses such as shops, bars and restaurants, grew by 0.3% in May, while the construction sector jumped by 1.9%.\nEconomists warn against placing too much weight on shifts in economic activity over one month because they can be affected by factors such as the weather.\nIn the three months to May 2024, the economy grew by 0.9% compared with the previous three months, which the ONS said was the quickest pace for more than two years.\nAnalysts said the surprisingly strong growth figures could reduce the chances of the  Bank of England cutting interest rates from the 16-year high of 5.25% when it meets  on 1 August.\nInterest rates were increased by the Bank in order to slow the pace of inflation - the rate at which prices rise. However, the latest inflation figures showed the rate had fallen back to the Bank's target of 2%.\nDespite this, two members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which decides the level of interest rates, have said this week they remain worried that inflationary pressures are persisting.\nStrong growth in the economy can push up demand for goods and staff, which in turn can increase prices and wages. The latest figures for inflation and wage rises will be published next week.\n\"This snapshot of an economy growing a bit faster than forecast, could make Bank of England policymakers that bit more reticent about voting for an interest rate cut,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"The possibility of a summer rate cut is fading, with a vote on 1 August expected to be on a knife-edge.\"\nRob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"The UK economy is well and truly putting last year\u2019s minor recession behind it.\n\"Rate-setters look desperate to ease policy and said in the minutes of their June meeting that they were unconcerned about stronger-than-expected growth,\" he added.\n\"Even so, this latest upside growth surprise supports our call that the MPC will wait until September to reduce Bank Rate.\"\n\nCarrie-Anne Moore runs alternative store Broken Bonds in Digbeth indoor market in Birmingham where she says business is booming.\n\"I started quite small and over the last six months it has grown quite substantially from a small unit to a big unit to a second spot so for me it\u2019s been pretty good,\" she said.\nAs well as her space in Digbeth Ms Moore also sells at markets and tattoo conventions.\n\u201cI think now people want to get out and about again, they don't want to shop online,\" Ms Moore added.\n\u201cThey want a more personable experience in shopping rather than just that faceless big corporation.\"\nHowever, things are not going so smoothly for Mark Preston, who runs Ideal Skateboard in Digbeth.\n\u201cIt's been a very difficult spring\u2026 nobody's really been coming out and buying stuff because the weather's been terrible,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSkateboarding is an outdoor sport so when it's wet, people just aren't out doing it. And so if they're not doing it, they're not buying more products.\"\nThe question of how to increase growth in the UK's economy was one of the key battlegrounds in the recent general election.\nResponding to the latest growth figures, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said economic growth was the government's \"national mission\", and \"that is why this week I have already taken the urgent action necessary to fix the foundations of our economy\".\nOn Monday, Ms Reeves said housebuilding targets would be reintroduced, planning restrictions would be overhauled and there would be an end to the effective ban on onshore wind farms in England.\nA new National Wealth Fund has also been announced to attract investment in infrastructure and green industry.\nThe shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Laura Trott said the latest economy figures \"show that the steps we put in place whilst in government have strengthened the economy\".\n\u201cThese figures also prove Labour are inheriting an economy turning a corner, after the many difficult decisions we took in government,\" she added.",
    "Political coverage and commentary takes up most of the front pages. The BBC, along with other broadcasters, is not allowed to report details of campaigning while the polls are open.\nAway from the UK election, a number of papers report on speculation that US President Joe Biden is considering ending his bid for a second term in the White House. It follows a shaky performance by Mr Biden in his first debate against Republican contender Donald Trump last week.\nThe Guardian reports that, at a briefing on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Mr Biden was \"absolutely not\" thinking about stepping back and that he had been \"very clear\" he was busy doing his job. \nA CBS News poll which indicated Mr Biden was in the lead a month ago found that Trump was two points ahead following the debate, according to The Financial Times. The paper says Mr Biden is under mounting pressure to withdraw, as Democratic politicians, party operatives, and donors question his prospects.\nThe paper also reports on the impact that Hurricane Beryl, which became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane on record as it moved across the Caribbean this week, is having on the insurance sector. It says the storm has \"battered\" shares as insurers prepare for significant losses and fuelled fears that warming oceans will worsen such storms in the future.\nThe Times reports on the awarding of the Order of the Thistle, Scotland's highest order of chivalry, to Queen Camilla and Duke of Edinburgh. The paper says King Charles III gave the two the honour in recognition of their charitable work in Scotland. \nThe Sun says hopes are rising that a drug that has been found in trials to slow memory decline in Alzheimer's patients will soon be available on the NHS. Donanemab - which clears the brain of toxic proteins - has been approved in the United States. \nThe paper says the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is expected to rule on Donanemab's use by the NHS before the end of the year. Alzheimer's Research UK tells the Sun that this marks another important milestone in the global effort to tackle dementia.\nAn archeological survey of more than 1,000 hectares of land in Shropshire has identified a wealth of previously unknown features, according to the Guardian. The paper says two grand Roman villas as well as a number of earlier iron age farmsteads have been detected. It says the survey is the largest ever conducted by the National Trust - and an archaeologist tells the paper that the extent of the discoveries was a \"surprise\".\nIn sport, the Times reports that Gareth Southgate may switch England's formation for the Euros quarter final against Switzerland after practising with a three-man defence in training. \nAnd the Guardian carries a picture of cyclist Mark Cavendish with his arms raised as he crossed the finish line to win the fifth stage of the Tour de France on Wednesday. The win took the 39-year-old to 35 stage wins in the race, meaning he has surpassed a record set by Belgian Eddy Merckx in 1975.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Such is the ruthless nature of politics, MPs can lose their jobs overnight - leaving behind a starting salary of \u00a391,000. \nAs the dust settles on one of the most dramatic general elections in a generation, how do long-serving politicians move on from losing their seats? And what support is available to those that face the prospect of unemployment?\nLike hundreds of other MPs, mostly Conservative, Peter Aldous lost his seat last week.\nHe had served the Waveney constituency in Suffolk for 14 years and was standing for the newly-formed Lowestoft seat, which fell to Labour with a 2,000 vote majority.\n\"All political careers end in failure,\" says a despondent Mr Aldous.\n\"And now I'm not sure what to do next... I'm 62 years old - how employable are former backbench MPs?\"\n\"Of course I wanted to be re-elected,\" he says. \u201cBut halfway through the campaign I realised I'd be facing the situation that I'm in now.\n\"My staff and supporters are incredibly upset and I'm supporting them through it.\"\nMr Aldous's office employed four members of staff who would now be made redundant - something he said he felt \"guilty\" about.\nOn Sunday, he travelled to Westminster to clear his parliamentary office.\n\"I'm a former chartered surveyor but when I became an MP I didn't keep a hand in that,\" he says.\n\"I don't think surveying is something that I'm going to do again because things have moved on.\n\"I'm starting out with a clean sheet of paper\u2026 It's too early to say whether I'll stay in politics.\"\nMr Aldous describes representing Waveney as a \"tremendous privilege\".\n\"Time will tell whether I left a lasting legacy,\" he adds.\nLike all MPs defeated at the general election, Mr Aldous will be eligible for support to help him plan his future and \"adapt to life away from Parliament\".\nThe House of Commons, through taxpayers' money, funds a \"transition\" service to support \"departing members\" with career planning, CV writing and interview techniques.\nIt also offers advice on personal security matters, returning IT equipment, backing up personal data in accordance with GDPR and mental health services.\nRecent changes to the way former MPs are treated by the House of Commons were introduced following reports that many were left on a \"financial and career cliff edge.\"\nCommons officials hope the move makes becoming an MP a more attractive career.\n\"If you tackle the role as I have done it's absolutely relentless,\" says former Conservative MP, Duncan Baker.\n\"I haven't had a single day off since the day I was elected. I had friendships disappear because you just simply don't have the time.\"\nMr Baker, 44, had represented the North Norfolk constituency since 2019 before it was won by the Liberal Democrats last week with a 3,000 vote majority.\n\"In some regards, there's now a weight off my shoulders,\" he says.\n\"I'm very much looking forward to getting my family back. I've missed them enormously.\"\nFormer MPs receive a Loss of Office Payment (LOOP) as well as a winding-up payment, equivalent to four months' salary.\nWhen asked how he feels losing his \u00a391,000-a-year salary, Mr Baker, a father of two young daughters, says it is \"tricky\".\n\"But you have to be sensible, you have to prepare for these things and you have to make sure you have a degree of savings to be able to continue for the next few days,\" he adds.\n\"I'm very lucky that my wife works extremely hard for a dual income in the household.\"\nThe House of Commons gives departing MPs four months to wind down their offices.\nFor Mr Baker, a qualified chartered accountant, that means closing down his local constituency office, supporting his six members of staff with redundancy and ending a contract with a family in London from who he rented a room to support his time in Westminster.\nHe says he is now looking for a \"commercial business opportunity\", possibly in the charity sector, and is ruling out an automatic return to politics.\n\"I hugely enjoyed what I've done\u2026 but I feel in a large sense that I've done my time,\" he adds.\n\"Never say never, but at the moment I want to move on from public life.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Senior Welsh Conservatives have rejected the suggestion by a defeated Tory ex-MP that the party should \"embrace\" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage.\nTwo current and former leaders of the Tories in the Senedd both dismissed the idea put forward by Sarah Atherton, who lost her seat in Wrexham at last Thursday's general election.\nAndrew RT Davies, the present leader, said the solutions to the problems of his party and Wales \"will not be found through the empty lens of Nigel Farage's pint glass\".\nPaul Davies, who previously held the Tory job, called the proposal \"a load of tosh\", and said Mr Farage was \"no Conservative\".\nMeanwhile, a new Welsh Labour MP has said change under Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer would take time, \"but rest assured that work has started already\".\nClaire Hughes, who won in Bangor Aberconwy with a majority of nearly 5,000, told Newyddion S4C there was not a \"burning enthusiasm\" for politicians after 14 years of Conservative government.\n\"I spoke to thousands of people on the doorstep during the campaign who told me they had lost trust in politics and in politicians in particular,\" said the Labour MP.\n\"I don't think there any love letters being written to politicians but that why we're here now to rebuild that trust.\"\nAsked when people could expect to see change, Ms Hughes said: \"It won't be overnight, but rest assured that work has started already.\"\nMs Atherton was one of the Tories who were defeated in Wales last Thursday, as the party saw its 2019 total of 14 MPs reduced to none.\nWrexham was among the swathe of north-east Wales seats that returned to Labour after five years with a Conservative MP.\nMs Atherton, speaking to BBC Wales as she cleared out her Westminster office, said of Mr Farage, now the MP for Clacton: \"He's a very successful politician, you cannot argue that and he certainly was instrumental within Brexit.\n\"I think Nigel Farage should have been embraced within the party. At what position and where that would be debatable, but he should have been embraced.\n\"We certainly, I don\u2019t think, would have been in this position right now if we'd have done that.\"\nMs Atherton said immigration was the \u201ckey issue\u201d in her patch and Reform UK \u201creally took my votes\u201d .\n\"If I'd have had the Reform vote I would have won,\u201d said Ms Atherton.\nShe lost to Labour's Andrew Ranger, who received 15,836 votes, or 5,948 more than her.

I say 'we' because it's collective, it's part of the Conservative Party,\" Mr Millar said.\n\"I can actually pinpoint the date in February 2020 when I said to colleagues in Westminster at that time that those who voted Conservative in 2019 were instinctively much more to the right of the parliamentary Conservative party than the Conservative MPs.\n\"That was a gap that we needed to resolve and we failed to do so.\n\"I failed to make that case within the Conservative party in Westminster but it's something that the Conservative party needs to look at now with real urgency.\n\"People told us they were not happy with the direction of policy we had taken in government and the consequence was Thursday.\"\nMr Millar said he \"bore no ill will\" to Reform UK candidates who \"saw an opportunity and took it\".\nAs well as winning five seats, Reform UK finished second in a slew of constituencies around the UK, with 15% of the vote.\nReform UK's leader, Nigel Farage, also became an MP for the first time after winning the seat of Clacton in Essex.\nAsked if Mr Farage should be admitted to the Conservative Party, Mr Millar said: \"That'll be a decision for the parliamentarians to make.\"\nHe added: \"It's not the people that's the issue, it's not even the policies, it's the principles and even the process I would say by which they go about it...

    "A judge has reduced the minimum term an 18-year-old man will have to serve after he was found guilty of murdering a schoolboy at a Glasgow railway station.\nJustin McLaughlin, 14, died in October 2021 after being stabbed in the heart by Daniel Haig, who was 16 at the time, at High Street Station.\nHaig was given a life sentence for the crime by judge Lord Clark at the High Court in Edinburgh in August 2023.\nHe would have been eligible for parole after serving a minimum of 16 years, but this has now been reduced to 13 years.\nHaig's lawyers told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that the initial sentence was \u201cexcessive\u201d.\nDefence advocate Michael Meehan KC told appeal judges Lady Dorrian, Lord Matthews and Lord Pentland that their colleague Lord Clark had made mistakes in how he decided to sentence Haig.\nMr Meehan argued that the judge should have taken the sentencing guidelines on young people into account when sentencing Haig.\nIn a written judgement published on Thursday, the appeal court upheld the submissions made to the court by Mr Meehan.\nLady Dorrian - who delivered the judgement - wrote that she and her colleagues had evidence before them about Haig\u2019s background that Lord Clark did not have.\nShe said this information showed that Haig had good prospects of being rehabilitated and he should be given a 13-year-long minimum term.\nShe wrote: \u201cHaving regard to all the known factors, and nevertheless fully acknowledging the dreadful nature of the offending, we are satisfied that the punishment part was excessive.\u201d\nHowever, Lady Dorrian noted that there was no guarantee that Haig would be released from custody at the end of that term.\nDuring the trial at the High Court in Glasgow, the court heard Haig had become involved in a scuffle with Justin and a group of his friends at the railway station on 16 October 2021.\nThe teenager pulled a knife out of his bag and was seen on CCTV chasing the group.\nJustin tripped and fell before Haig caught up and stabbed him.\nHaig told the trial he had a knife in his rucksack for \"protection\" after claiming to have been attacked the day before.\nHe also said he had not intended to kill the 14-year-old.\nThe court previously heard that Justin, from Coatbridge in North Lanarkshire, had begged for his mother after being attacked.\nHe was taken to hospital but never recovered.\nHaig admitted knifing Justin but had denied murder, however he was found guilty following the trial.\nThe judge said the murder had a \"devastating effect\" on the victim's family.\nPassing sentence, Lord Clark said: \"They were all running some distance away from you, but Justin McLaughlin tripped and fell.\n\"You ran right up to him and as he was standing back up you stabbed him. The knife went right through his heart.\"\nThe judge added that it was \"deeply disturbing\" to see gang activity still happening in Scotland.\nIn the latest judgement, Lady Dorrian noted that evidence showed that Haig had become \u201cnormalised\u201d to violence through his upbringing.\nShe wrote: \u201cThe information now available to the court shows exposure to extreme domestic violence from an early age, first as a witness, later as a victim, and thereafter as a perpetrator.\n\u201cThe appellant\u2019s mother is reported to have stabbed his father and, on a later date, to have threatened the appellant with a knife while he was holding his younger sibling.\n\u201cThe older relative, association with whom seems to have triggered an escalation in the appellant\u2019s behaviour, is alleged to be involved in criminal behaviour in the east end of Glasgow and to have links to serious and organised crime.\"\nLady Dorrian said Haig's father and uncle were both serving lengthy prison sentences for violence, and an older maternal cousin was serving a prison sentence for murder.\n\u201cIt is clear that the appellant has grown up in a familial environment in which the use of violence, including the use of weapons, has been normalised,\" she added.\nLady Dorrian also noted how there were signs of \u201cpositive engagement\u201d between Haig and staff at St Mary\u2019s Kenmure secure unit - the institution where he was placed following the sentencing.\nShe wrote: \u201cThere are good indications throughout the material that the appellant is a young man with some potential.\u201d",
    "Energy boss Greg Jackson has said people living near wind farms \u2013 such as in Scotland - should pay less for their electricity.\nThe founder and chief executive of Octopus said it was \"crazy\" that the electricity price was the same across the UK.\nHis firm already offers a discount on bills for people living near wind farms, and this has led to lots of local interest in their construction, he said.\nNew Chancellor Rachel Reeves set out plans on Monday to boost onshore wind farms.\nSpeaking at an event hosted by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, Mr Jackson said his company had recently offered people living near turbines a discount on their electricity: 20% when it was windy, and 50% when it was \"very windy\".\nThe discounts were offered to customers in Caerphilly in South Wales and Halifax and Weighton in Yorkshire.\nSome 30,000 individuals and communities in the UK have contacted Octopus since 2021 asking for a turbine to be built near them, the company said.\nMr Jackson called for \u201creal reform of markets\u201d, adding that the more people were able to use locally generated electricity, the longer it would be possible to hold off or avoid building new transmission lines to move the energy around.\nAnalysis from the think tank Carbon Tracker suggested that wasted wind power added about \u00a340 to household energy costs, directly and indirectly, in 2023.\nThis is because when it is very windy, the grid cannot handle the extra power generated. Wind farms are paid to switch off and gas-powered stations are paid to fire up, or electricity is imported, and the cost is passed on to consumers.\nMr Jackson said that when it was windy in Scotland, instead of paying wind farms to turn off, \u201cwe give Scottish people cheap or free electricity at those times. And we can see that the shortage of electricity in other regions means\u2026 we build batteries in the South East.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll give us the investment signals,\u201d he said, adding that it was \u201cabsolutely outrageous... [that] at the times we are turning the wind farms off in Scotland, we are importing electricity from Norway into Scotland\".\nMr Jackson said that, according to FTI Consulting, regional pricing in the UK would mean \u201cevery region would be cheaper than it is now, because we\u2019re eliminating waste\".\n\u201cData centres wouldn\u2019t be queueing up, waiting 10 years to be built in Slough or going overseas \u2013 they would be setting up in Scotland, and they\u2019d have the cheapest electricity in Europe,\u201d he said.\nHe called on policy makers, the energy sector and the large users of energy to work together to create mechanisms that will unleash innovation and \"drive down costs for everyone\".\nIn her first speech as chancellor this week, Rachel Reeves said she would overhaul planning restrictions and end an effective ban on onshore wind farms in England to speed up national infrastructure projects.\nLabour will also overturn rules brought in by the Tories in 2015 which effectively meant that a very small number of objections could block new onshore wind projects.\nIt should lead to hundreds of new turbines being built, but Ms Reeves conceded that there would be opposition to her infrastructure plans.\n\"I'm not naive to that, and we must acknowledge that trade-offs always exist,\" she said.\nThe plans were described by one county councillor in Lincolnshire as an \"attack on the countryside\".",
    "The father of an aid worker who died in a plane crash said a deal in the US courts, which means manufacturer Boeing will avoid being prosecuted, was \"devastating\" for bereaved families.\nSam Pegram, from Penwortham, in Lancashire, was one of 346 people killed in two crashes involving Boeing aircraft in 2018 and 19.\nHis family wanted the company to face a criminal trial but now the plane-maker has agreed a deal with the courts to plead guilty to criminal fraud conspiracy and pay a criminal fine of $243.6m (\u00a3190m).\nSam's father, Mark Pegram, said there was \"zero accountability\" for the lives lost in the \"sweetheart deal\".\nBy pleading guilty, Boeing will avoid a criminal trial, if the settlement is agreed by a US judge.\nA Boeing 737 Max plane operated by Indonesia's Lion Air crashed in October 2018 shortly after take-off, killing all 189 people on board. \nJust months later, an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing all 157 passengers and crew, of which Sam was one.\nIn 2021, prosecutors charged Boeing with one count of conspiracy to defraud regulators, alleging it had deceived the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about its MCAS flight control system, which was implicated in both crashes.\nIt agreed not to prosecute Boeing if the company paid a penalty and successfully completed a three-year period of increased monitoring and reporting.\nBut in January, shortly before that period was due to end, a door panel in a Boeing plane operated by Alaska Airlines blew out soon after take-off and forced the jet to land.\nNo-one was injured during the incident but it intensified scrutiny over how much progress Boeing had made on improving its safety and quality record.\nAs part of the new deal, Boeing must also invest $455m (\u00a3355m) in \"compliance and safety programs\" and be monitored for three years.\nMr Pegram, who now lives in York, said: \"It\u2019s not enough. \n\"There's no accountability for the 346 lives lost. The deaths aren't even mentioned.\"\nHe said bereaved families want Boeing \"to be held to account for what they have done and also act as a deterrent for others\". \nHe said: \"Unfortunately, it is a take it or leave it; the judge hasn't got the flexibility to amend elements of the plea deal so we will be arguing that he should throw that plea deal out.\"\nLast year West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield ruled the three British people who died in the 2019 crash - Sam Pegram, Oliver Vick and Joanna Toole - were unlawfully killed. \nMr Pegram described his 25-year-old son at the inquest as a kind, compassionate man with an infectious sense of humour.\n\"He had a passion for human rights, but also had the drive and inner strength to make a difference,\" Mr Pegram said.\nThe family has set up the Sam Pegram Humanitarian Foundation to provide support services for refugees and early career humanitarians both in the UK and in Jordan where the aid worker spent two years of his life. \nThe foundation has launched the Sam Pegram Scholarship in his memory at the University of York where he graduated. It provides funding for an international student to study for an LLM in International Human Rights Law and Practice.\nThe charity has also organised fundraisers for Sir Tom Finney Soccer Centre to help refugees and asylum seekers access football in Preston.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds\u00a0and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Alec Baldwin's trial opened in New Mexico on Wednesday with the prosecution and defence painting starkly different pictures of the events leading up to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. \nMr Baldwin, known for roles on the sitcom 30 Rock and portraying Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, is facing up to 18 months in prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter.\nMs Hutchins, 42, died after a gun Mr Baldwin was rehearsing with went off. It was found that the film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, accidentally mixed up dummy bullets with live ammunition she had brought from home. \nMr Baldwin has pleaded not guilty and maintains he never pulled the trigger when the gun went off. \nIn their opening statements, the defence portrayed Mr Baldwin as an actor simply doing his job, who placed his trust in a crew charged with ensuring weapon safety.\nProsecutors argued he was a man with a flagrant disregard for gun safety on a film set with a small budget and an inexperienced cast. \nProsecutor Erlinda Johnson opened the trial by telling the jury that the case was \"simple\" and \"straightforward\". \nMr Baldwin \"played make-believe with a real gun\" and \"violated the cardinal rules of firearms safety\", Ms Johnson argued. \n\u201cWhile it was a movie set, it was a real, live workplace for many people,\" she said in her opening statements. \"You will hear that this workplace was on a tight budget... and some of the people who were hired were inexperienced.\"\nMr Baldwin's defence team, however, argued firearms are treated differently on a film set, where each member of a cast has a designated role and obligation, including when it comes to safety and firearms. \n\"He was just acting as he's done for generations, and it was the safety apparatus that failed them all,\" Baldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro said.\n\"Alec Baldwin committed no crime,\" he said firmly, later adding: \"It was an actor handling a prop.\" \nThose crew members responsible for safety - including Gutierrez-Reed and David Halls, an assistant director and safety co-ordinator - failed their jobs, he argued. \n\"Real bullets are never supposed to be on movie sets,\" Mr Spiro said.\nBoth Halls and Gutierrez-Reed faced charges in the fatal shooting. \nHalls has pleaded guilty to unsafe handling of a firearm and Gutierrez-Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year, and sentenced to 18 months in prison. \nA key issue during the trial is Mr Baldwin's claim that he did not pull the trigger when the revolver he was holding went off.\nProsecutors took aim at the claim early, detailing the extensive FBI tests done on the weapon. \nIt \"worked perfectly fine as it was designed,\" Ms Johnson told the jury. \nMr Baldwin's team also brought up the tests and noted that during one of them, the FBI destroyed parts of the weapon - thus preventing it from being used for further analysis as part of their defence. \nThe rest of the trial will feature several witnesses and video and audio from the Rust  set, including from the day Ms Hutchins was killed. \nThe first witness called on Wednesday was Officer Nicholas LeFleur, who responded to the scene and tried to aid Hutchins after she was shot. \nFootage from his body camera was shown in court.\nThe room, which can hold about 100 people, was filled with heavy sighs as they watched some of Ms Hutchins' last moments. \nMr Baldwin was visibly uncomfortable, leaning back and forth and at some times grimacing and covering his face. \nThe trial is set to continue until 19 July. Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison.",
    "\"It felt good.\"\nThis is what 27-year-old, Daniel O'Reilly told BBC News NI when asked about winning the inaugural League of Ireland Down Syndrome Futsal Cup.\nCounty Donegal side Finn Harps beat Dundalk 6-2 on 9 June in County Meath to claim the cup.\nAlmost one month on, the team got a hero's welcome as they paraded the trophy around the home of the Ballybofey club, Finn Park.\nThe team is made up of players from both sides of the border, including players from counties Donegal, Londonderry and Tyrone.\nMr O'Reilly from Letterkenny said: \"It was a long day but it was fun.\n\"I would definitely play again.\" \nFutsal is similar to football but is played indoors between two five-player teams with a smaller, less bouncy ball.\nMr O'Reilly was also part of Ireland's first ever side to compete in the futsal European Championships in Italy last September. \nDaniel's mother Gabrielle O'Reilly said: \"They are trying to keep the incentive going so the opportunity to play for Ireland will be there for the adults with Down's syndrome. \n\"It gives them a great opportunity that they've never had before.\"\nMs O'Reilly said she was \"just so proud because he loves football\".\nBut there were concerns at first about how Mr O'Reilly would get on, his mother admitted. \n\"It's a little bit different. It's indoors, there's only five in the team. The ball is a bit different as well. It's a little bit heavier and there are different rules.\n\"So we weren't totally sure how he would adapt to it. But he really enjoyed it and actually you could see the improvement.\" \nStephen McNutt is the social responsibility officer at Finn Harps.\nHe said the competition provides a pathway for Down's syndrome players, who usually cannot play at a higher level than the National League. \nHowever, Mr McNutt said that the enjoyment which the players experience outweighs everything else. \n\"Just to be involved with them and see the determination and to see them competing on an equal level, which is the first time ever,\" he added.\nHe added that the plan to run the event on a quarterly basis offers a \"great opportunity\" for the players. \nMs O'Reilly agreed and said it sent out \"a great message to the people coming behind us that they have these opportunities as well.\" \n\"You do need the support of the teams like our local Finn Harps who get on board to run with it\", she said.\n\"It was also through our local Down's syndrome association that all this is getting off the ground.\"\nMark Scanlon, who is the director of the League of Ireland, said there had been \"huge buy in\" from clubs.\n\"The initial competition, we hoped for a few clubs and we ended up with eight teams,\" he said. \n\"The first cup went really well, it was a brilliant weekend.\"\n \"It was competitive with great skill on show,\" he added.\n\"We want to make sure the competition grows and get a few more clubs to take part.\"",
    "Heathrow Airport has been granted a High Court injunction against potential environmental protesters on the site.\nOn Tuesday, lawyers for the airport appeared before a judge in London to ask for an order preventing demonstrators from trespassing on the site.\nKatharine Holland KC, for the airport, told the court that the site was a \"clear and obvious target for planned disruptive action\" by protesters affiliated with Just Stop Oil and \"other environmental campaigns\".\nIt follows two Just Stop Oil activists being arrested on suspicion of criminal damage after appearing to spray orange paint over private jets at Stansted Airport.\nMs Holland said Heathrow Airport was featured in a video published on the Just Stop Oil website, which represented \"the identification of a specific threat to this location\".\nThe court was told that the airport - Europe's busiest - handles more than 1,300 flights and about 227,000 passengers on average daily, with the actions of potential protesters risking \"significant\" harm.\nIn written submissions, Ms Holland continued: \"There would also be severe disruption to passengers, and the proper operations of the airport more generally.\"\nAt the end of the hearing, Mr Justice Julian Knowles granted the injunction, which lasts for five years and will be reviewed every 12 months.\nHe said: \"If these protesters want to stand on public land near the entrances to Heathrow Airport then they can do.\n\"What they can't do is go on to private land and do it.\"\nFollowing the hearing, a Heathrow Airport spokesperson said: \"We agree that aviation must decarbonise, however disrupting people's well-earned travel plans with irresponsible action is not the way to deliver the transition to net zero.\n\"This isn't a decision we've taken lightly, but we cannot condone activity that endangers the safety of our passengers and colleagues.\"\nThe move comes days after Stansted, Manchester and East Midlands airports were given similar injunctions against would-be protesters.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An Australian soldier and her husband have been arrested and each charged with spying for Russia.\nInvestigators say the couple - both Russian-born Australian citizens - obtained Australian Defence Force (ADF) material to share with Moscow.\nHowever, Australian police say \"no significant compromise\" of military secrets has been identified.\nIt is the first time stricter foreign interference laws - introduced by Australia in 2018 - have been used to lay espionage charges.\nKira Korolev, a 40-year-old army private, and her 62-year-old husband Igor Korolev faced court in Brisbane on Friday, each on one count of preparing for an espionage offence \u2013 which carries a maximum 15-year jail sentence.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been \"briefed extensively\" by the nation's security agencies but would not comment on the case directly as it is now before the courts.\nAustralian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Reece Kershaw said the couple had been in Australia for more than a decade before the alleged offending and had both become citizens several years ago.\nIgor worked as a self-employed labourer, and Kira was an information systems technician in the army, a role for which she had obtained a security clearance, police say.\nMr Kershaw alleged she secretly travelled to Russia while on leave from the ADF, then instructed Igor to access her work account and send sensitive material so that she could forward it on to Russian authorities.\nAn investigation in to whether any of the material was ever delivered to them is still underway, Mr Kershaw said, adding that the charges could be upgraded.\nBoth Mr Kershaw and Australia's spy agency boss Mike Burgess \u2013 who addressed media together on Friday - declined to answer questions about the nature of the documents or how authorities were tipped off about the alleged crimes.\nBut Mr Burgess said that the ongoing threat of espionage is \"real\".\n\"Multiple countries are seeking to steal Australia's secrets. We cannot be naive, and we cannot be complacent.\"\n\"If you are spying in this country, we are looking for you. If you are being spied on in this country, we are looking out for you,\" he added.\nMr Kershaw stressed that Australia's allies could be \"confident\" that the country would \"continue to identify and disrupt espionage and foreign interference activity\".\nIn a statement, the ADF said it was aware one of its members had been arrested and that it \"takes all breaches of security seriously\".",

    "With the stress of managing 83 employees taking its toll, Hannu Rauma was feeling discouraged and frustrated.\n\u201cI was getting too bogged down in all these things that were going wrong amongst the teams, and feeling this disappointment,\u201d says Mr Rauma, who is based in Vancouver, Canada.\nHe is a senior manager at a company called Student Marketing Agency, which employs university students to provide marketing support for small businesses.\n\u201cWhen I was bringing new clients on board, half of my mind would be saying, \u2018we're going to screw up\u2019, and it would dampen my enthusiasm.\u201d\nBut Mr Rauma says that all changed from last November, when the firm began using an autonomous AI manager developed by US-based company Inspira.\nThe AI manager helps the agency\u2019s employees, who work flexible hours remotely, to set their schedules and plan their workloads in advance.\nIt checks their timekeeping, sends them deadline reminders and regular check-in messages, and records the time spent on different clients, so the latter can be billed accurately. The AI also makes suggestions to improve the wording of written text, is available to answer work-related questions, and automatically updates everyone\u2019s work progress in a central portal.\nMr Rauma says that the shift towards an AI manager has not only reduced his stress levels, but has enabled his employees to work faster and be more productive. \u201cI'm able to focus on the growth of the company and all the positive things. It's added years to my life, I'm sure,\u201d he says.\nMr Rauma adds that his relationships with his employees have also improved drastically. \u201cBefore, it felt a lot like a father-child situation. Now, we're more on an equal footing. Before, it was only about solving problems. But now we\u2019re able to have more light-hearted discussions.\u201d\nBut not everyone at Student Marketing Agency is using the AI manager yet. Mr Rauma and 26 of his 83 employees were actually part of a study run by Inspira and academics from Columbia University, Arizona State University, and the University of Wisconsin to compare the performance of the AI manager with its human counterparts.\nParticipants were divided into three groups: one coached by a human manager, another by the AI manager, and the last group by both AI and human manager.\nThe AI manager achieved a 44% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays in advance, and was able to motivate the employees to log in on time 42% of the time. These figures were comparable to the human manager, who achieved scores of 45% and 44% for those two areas.\nYet when the AI manager worked in partnership with a human manager, together they achieved a 72% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays, and managed to achieve 46% on-time success.\nDespite the study being statistically small, and concentrated on a specific type of worker and field, its results point to interesting implications for companies introducing AI tools.\nWhile businesses like UPS, Dell and others have announced significant job cuts this year, with the intention of replacing many roles with AI, Prof Paul Thurman, from Columbia University in New York, argues that swapping management roles completely for AI would be a mistake.\n\u201cThe middle management layer is the most critical layer in any organisation,\u201d says the professor of management. \u201cThey're the layer that, if it starts turning over, you're in for a wild ride. Your people don't see continuity, they don't get mentoring and coaching\u2026 all the human things that human managers are better at than AI and should be focusing on.\u201d\nAI, Prof Thurman adds, can liberate managers from endless reminding and checking in, to focus on more innovative ways of working. For example, managers can cherry pick project teams based on individual skillsets, oversee the brief, then hand over to their AI to manage minutiae like deadlines.\nAI can also identify who in the team is falling behind and may need to be managed more closely by a human, and by the same token, hone in on star performers who require extra recognition.\nBut companies should steer away from AI managers becoming a surveillance tool, he says.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get to a point where you are noting that, not only do people not clock in on time, but they take too much time at lunch, and they're not eating enough salad. You don't want to go that far,\u201d says Prof Thurman. \u201cYou want to find the right way to encourage the right behaviours.\u201d\nAI managers can also help people who have become \u201caccidental managers\u201d - people who excel in their roles and end up managing people as a result, despite management not being a natural skill for them, says Tina Rahman, founder of London-based HR consultancy, HR Habitat.\n\u201cWe did a study which looked at the reasons people leave a job. Almost 100% of the respondents said it was because of bad management.\n\u201cSome of them said they didn\u2019t like the way they'd been managed, and most of them also said it was because they didn\u2019t know what was expected of the",

    "Voters in Worcester say they hope the city's new Labour MP and new government will bring change and a pledge to \"sort the issues out.\"\nLabour won the seat for the first time since 2010, when Tom Collins beat Conservative Marc Bayliss by a majority of 7,116.\nSpeaking to the BBC after his win, Mr Collins thanked his family, who he said had made the \"biggest sacrifice\" during the campaign.\nWorcester is historically considered a bellwether seat in general elections, with the outcome mirroring the overall national result.\nMr Collins came despite Labour recording fewer votes in the city than 2019, with 18,622 compared to 19,098 five years ago.\nSince 2010, the constituency was held by Conservative MP, Robin Walker, who had announced he would be standing down before this general election,\nConservative voter, Corinna Sampson, from Worcester, said she had voted for the party tactically, in an attempt to stop Labour from getting in.\n\u201cI\u2019m just a bit disappointed with the result,\" she told the BBC. \"It\u2019s difficult because I don\u2019t think any of them are really doing what we want at the moment, so it\u2019s picking the best of a bad bunch.\n\u201cIt was a tactical vote but it didn\u2019t work, \" she explained.\nCarol and Malcolm Pass, from Stourport, in the Wyre Forest, both also voted for the Conservatives, but said they will give Labour the benefit of the doubt as the country needed to go in a new direction.\n\u201cWe need a change of some sort, so I hope it\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Mr Pass said.\nMrs Pass said she felt \"very looked after\" by the Conservative government who she said had helped with energy bills, pensions and NHS care.\n\"They made a lot of mistakes, so let\u2019s hope they learn by the mistakes and get in next time,\" she added.\nElsewhere Amanda Wright, who is retired, also voted tactically, despite not being a natural Labour voter.\nWhile waiting for the bank to open, she said her husband was a Labour canvasser and therefore she felt she had \u201cbeen a widow the last six weeks\" of the election campaign.\nMs Wright said she wanted Prime Minister Keir Starmer to be honest about the need for everyone to contribute more in taxes to help public services and the welfare state.\n\u201cI think everybody has to contribute, you know we can\u2019t have people that are not contributing throughout their lives but are only taking,\u201d she said.\nBus driver and single parent Kelly Atkinson is hoping the Labour government will help her with the cost of living as she is \"struggling to plod along.\"\nShe didn't confirm who she had voted for, but said she wanted to see \"more fairness\" within the benefits and welfare system.\nHer dad Adrian did not vote, but said he hoped the new government would \u201cdo a bit better than the last one\u201d, as everything was \u201cgoing downhill.\u201d\nNHS worker Lydia Munslow has been lifelong Labour voter, but the party did not get her support this time as she doesn't agree with \"everything that Keir Starmer had put forwards\".\nShe said she was glad Tories were out, but felt apprehensive about the future and was concerned over whether she would ever get on the housing ladder.\n\"I\u2019m 34 and I\u2019m still living at home as I can\u2019t afford to move out, even own a flat because it\u2019s that expensive on my wage,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that [Sir Kier] does listen to the British people and actually sorts the issues out that we all want sorting out.\u201d\nThe Reform UK party won four seats at the general election, on a night which saw them garner more than four million votes.\nLifelong Conservative voter and surveyor Stuart Evans, from Stourport, said he had voted for Reform.\nHe said he thought party leader Nigel Farage \u201cunderstands exactly the way the world should run\u201d.\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Gerry McCluskey was addicted to alcohol for years.\nIt caused problems in family relationships, including with his children.\nHe lost everything and found himself homeless.\nNow, less than a year later, he has replaced drinking with a new addiction - gardening. \nOriginally from East Kilbride, Gerry moved to Canada with his wife and two children more than 25 years ago.\nWhen alcohol issues led to the breakdown of his marriage, he moved back to Scotland and into the home he grew up in in South Lanarkshire, with his 94-year-old mum.\nA family fallout led to Gerry becoming homeless,  before help came in the form of the Eva Burrows Centre in Cambuslang, run by The Salvation Army. \nIt provides supported accommodation to single men, women and families who are homeless.\nSpecialist care staff help residents rebuild their lives.\nOne of the activities offered is gardening on an allotment. \nIt's been a game-changer for Gerry, who only six months ago said he was in \"the deepest depression\".\n\"It's therapeutic, it soothes the soul,\" he said.\n\"I just look at the weeds as being all my negative thoughts. I'm getting rid of them, pulling them all out. I like tidying up, trimming the hedges\".\nGerry is on a quest for self-improvement in every area. The allotment is next to a large park and getting his 20,000 steps a day is part of a routine that includes gardening, reading and socialising with other residents.\nHe added: \"Being out in green space has helped more than words can say and I think it would help anybody\".\nHe loves the outdoors and says the Gerry of old would find it hard to imagine the Gerry of today - weeding, nurturing seeds and watching wildlife. \n\"I thought I'd be dead. But here we are, living life to the full now\".\nHe acknowledges he has swapped one unhealthy addiction for another, very positive, addiction and that the need to be outside amongst the poppies, herbs, onions and beetroot is a necessity not a luxury.\nGerry, 59, has been through it. \nHe had worked in construction but was forced to quit his job after a car accident, unable to work for seven years.\nHe also survived a cancer diagnosis and his mental health suffered.\nGerry says the Eva Burrows centre has helped him rebuild his life.\nHe is hoping to find work and a place of his own soon.\nHe said: \"It has been a humbling experience. But the staff have been amazing. They are godsent. \n\"What I particularly enjoy is the garden space here. During the day I can potter around and at night I can sit in my room and look out at it and feel good. I don't sleep a lot at night so I\u2019ll sit and watch the wildlife come and go. It's just amazing to watch nature in action.\n\u201cI love to pick weeds in the garden. My mind is like a fertile garden and if I don't keep cleaning it then the bad thoughts get out of control.\"\nYvonne McKenzie is a support worker at the centre. She's seen countless men and women, with no initial interest in horticulture, turn into green-fingered garden-lovers after getting involved in the allotments programme at the centre.\n\"We brought this out to give people another option of support, for mental health but also wellbeing. It was to let people feel a part of something. It's been very successful.\"\nResidents are taught how to grow, nurture and cook the fruit and vegetables from the garden just outside their windows.\nShe said: \"It's a place that people can escape from their day-to-day struggles, forget for a wee bit, clear their mind.\n\"It gives them a place in their minds. There's always a reason for the addiction, their coping strategy is the addiction.\n\"When they come in here into the garden it's as if they've been given another form of addiction.  I'm not saying they stop (taking drugs) but it reduces their intake, so it's a start.\"\nYvonne finds the garden gives people a new perspective.\n\"There's a lot that they've seen - turmoil, trauma. To then see plants and flowers, life starting to grow. It is showing them positive things, things that are alive and growing. \n\"They respect their own life more.\n\"Anything positive in their life when they have no hope is a lifeline\".\nYvonne works with Stirling University where researchers have found spending time in green spaces can be \"life-changing\" for people experiencing addiction and mental health issues.\nAnd with high levels of drug and alcohol use in Scotland and long waits for psychological therapies, research from the university shows that time spent in parks, gardens, woodland could be a way to support this rising demand for support while limiting costs.\nDr Wendy Masterton, lecturer in criminology at the university, told BBC Scotland News: \"Most people know that being outside in nature is beneficial for their health and my research is looking at why that is the case.\"\nShe said it came down to several things.\n\"First is the effect of nature itself, getting away from stressors of day-to-day life and feeling removed, also having space and time to reflect when you are outside.\n\"The other factor is thinking of changes w",

    "Thousands of prisoners will be released early at the start of September, the justice secretary has announced.\nShabana Mahmood warned of the \"total collapse\" of the prison system and a \"total breakdown of law and order\" without urgent action to ease prison overcrowding.\nShe accused Rishi Sunak and the previous Conservative government of a \"disgraceful dereliction of duty\" for not dealing with the crisis when they were in power. \nUnder her plan, some prisoners will be released after they have served 40% of their sentence in England and Wales, rather than the current 50%. \nMs Mahmood said she expected the first batch of prisoners released in September to be \"in the low thousands\", with further releases over the next 18 months and updates made to Parliament every three months. \nOver the next 18 months, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) told BBC Verify it estimated up to 4,000 extra male prisoners and fewer than 1,000 female prisoners will be released under the new measures. \nSentences for serious violent offences of four years or more and sex offences will be automatically excluded from the change, as will the early release of offenders in prison for domestic abuse connected crimes, including stalking and choking. \nSpeaking at HMP Five Wells in Northamptonshire, Ms Mahmood said jails had been operating at 99% capacity since the start of last year and were now weeks away from running out of space.\nIf that happened overflow police cells would be filled, she warned, leading to \"van-loads of dangerous people circling the country with nowhere to go\".\nShe added: \"Soon, the courts would grind to a halt, unable to hold trials.\n\u201cWith officers unable to act, criminals could do whatever they want, without consequence. \n\"We could see looters running amok, smashing in windows, robbing shops and setting neighbourhoods alight.\n\"In short, if we fail to act now, we face the collapse of the criminal justice system. And a total breakdown of law and order.\"\nAs Ms Mahmood painted a bleak picture she would have been aware that allowing some prisoners out early will not be popular with some people.\nBut she stressed that she had been \u201cleft with no choice at all\u201d blaming the previous Conservative government for the crisis. \nMs Mahmood knows that the questions and criticism will quickly come her way if this scheme does not work or leads to a rise in offences.\nConservative shadow security minister Tom Tugendhat said in a social media post: \"In what world is releasing 20,000 criminals onto our streets a good idea.\"\nHowever, early release is not new, and the previous justice secretary Alex Chalk announced plans for some prisoners to be released up to two months early back in March under the Conservative government.\nMr Chalk, who lost his seat at the general election, told the Today podcast there had also been plans to go further and release some prisoners after 40% of their sentence \u2013 as has been announced on Friday \u2013 and to send fewer people to jail in the first place. \nBBC News understands that several Conservative cabinet ministers supported the idea, but Rishi Sunak refused to sign it off and the election was called before the issue was resolved.\nThe Ministry of Justice's (MoJ) weekly statistics suggest there are currently 1,451 prison cell spaces left across England and Wales, and an increase of 1,161 inmates over the past 12 months.\nMark Icke, Vice-president of the Prison Governors Association (PGA), welcomed the announcement, saying the crisis is \u201cunprecedented\u201d and prison governors have been \u201cwarning for some time\u201d that \u201cwe\u2019ve got far too many prisoners in our system\u201d.\nEx-Labour MP Harriet Harman believes that too many women are being locked up and says the criminal justice system should deal with them in a different way. \n\"Most women are in prison for very short sentences for non-violent crimes, [and] most themselves have been victims of violence as well,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"There is a very, very different pattern of men and women's offending\", Ms Harman said, giving the example of women in for drug offences being less likely to be gang leaders than men, and instead often being victims themselves.\nShe added that 40% of women in UK jails are foreign nationals who should be serving sentences in their home countries. \nConservative MP Greg Smith said the Ministry of Justice should focus on building more prisons to ease the pressure on prison places.\nHe also argued it was \"a bit rich\" for Labour to claim they did not want to let prisoners out early.\nHe told the BBC: \"I don't think Labour can pretend that this is anything other than something they would naturally do.\"\nThe chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor said \"this measure will inevitably lead to the early release of some risky offenders\" but a decision on how to tackle the issue \"needed to be taken and none would have been without risk\". \nMr Taylor added the move would add to the workload of already stretched prison OMUs [Offender Management Units] and probat",
    "A diabetic patient has had both legs saved from amputation by new microwave technology.\nBarry Mayled, 74, has type two diabetes and watched foot ulcers steadily worsen during the Covid pandemic until surgeons said they had no choice but to amputate.\nBut Mr Mayled said a medical student observing his care mentioned microwave treatment as an option and, following nine months of treatment, he is now \"totally clear\".\nHis \"severely ulcerated\" feet were treated using Swift, a microwave technology developed by Stirling-based Emblation.\nIt uses low energy doses of microwaves to stimulate the immune system.\nWarning: This story contains graphic images\nThe architect and gardener, from Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan, said he wanted to continue working and have a good quality of life during retirement.\nBut he admitted the prospect of losing his legs \"doesn't bare thinking about\".\nMr Mayled said: \"It saved my life. I'm still working and I'm on building sites and everything, and without my legs, that would have been the end of it. \n\"As a sole practitioner, my career would have ended if the amputations were carried out.\n\"At one point I was in hospital surrounded by medics and things were so bad that the main surgeon was just shaking his head. \n\"There was pretty much nothing left to try and it was a matter of 'when' not 'if' my legs would have to be amputated below the knees.\"\nHe credits Tracey Davies, of Toetal Footcare, for identifying the problem.\nMr Mayled initially thought he had a bruise which grew while on holiday and \"burst\".\nBut he was then diagnosed with an ulcer which, over time, spread to both feet.\nLeg amputations are a known complication of diabetes which can cause reduced blood flow and nerve damage in the lower limbs.\nAs a result, wounds, ulcers and infections can become gangrenous.\n\"This went on for about two years, trying to clean this ulcer up by which time Covid came along.\" he said\n\"We were left a little bit high and dry and it transpired this was getting worse and worse to the point where I could hardly walk.\n\"The only bit of luck I had was in this grouping around me which was made up of wound clinic podiatrists, there was a student just observing.\n\"She said what about microwave treatment and they turned around and virtually silenced her with their eyes because the NHS do not use microwave treatment to treat what turned out to be a diabetic ulcer with underlying verruca tissue.\"\nMr Mayled, who was treated by Ms Davies at Toetal Footcare in Cardiff, received seven applications of the Swift microwave technology on five areas of his right foot and three on his left.\nMs Davies said Mr Mayled received excellent wound care from the NHS but Swift provided an alternative way to address the problem.\nShe said: \"Quite frankly we had nothing to lose.\n\u201cBarry\u2019s case has highlighted verrucae infection as a possible cause of foot ulcerations failing to heal and has increased the possibilities of using Swift in such cases. \n\"This could be far-reaching in the treatment of non-healing foot ulcerations, thus preventing unnecessary amputations.\"\nThe expert said she was \"amazed\" by the \"remarkable turnaround\".\nShe said: \"My business partner and I have both been HCPC-registered podiatrists for more than 40 years and Swift has shown the most effective treatment outcomes for verrucae we have treated to date.\"\nSwift was developed in 2016 by scientists Gary Beale and Eamon McErlean, who met while studying at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.\nThe pair then teamed up to launch parent company Emblation, based in Stirling.\nThe Swift device has been used by podiatrists across the world to treat verrucae and plantar warts with medical testing being carried out to test its use in treating other conditions and lesions, like basal cell carcinoma.\nGary Beale, chief executive of Emblation, said Barry's story was \"truly inspiring\" and described the company's technology as \"game-changing\".",
    "Saturday's front pages lead on Labour's landslide victory as Sir Keir Starmer promises to build a \"government of service\" after becoming the UK's first Labour prime minister since 2010. Most pages are awash with images of a smiling Sir Keir outside No 10.\nQuoting his first speech as prime minister, the headline in the Times is: \"The work of change begins\". \nThe Daily Mirror says the \"morning's drizzle didn't dampen people's spirits, such was the sense of relief and euphoria on Downing Street\". \nBut the Daily Mail strikes a different tone. It says: \"Now he has to deliver\", after Sir Keir won what it calls a \"loveless landslide\". \nAccording to the Financial Times, the new prime minister knows that public support for Labour is \"shallow\", but his \"avowedly pro-business agenda appears to have paid off\" already, with housebuilding companies making gains on the stock market. \nThe Sun says the government will \"declare Britain open for business with a bonfire of planning regulations and a global investment drive\". \nThe i newspaper reports that the government will also set out its plans to nationalise the rail network. \nWhile the Daily Telegraph suggests that Sir Keir's priority in his first week of government will be tackling illegal migration, although sources tell the paper that he has \"killed off\" the Rwanda asylum scheme.\nAlso in the Telegraph, a Conservative insider claims Rishi Sunak \"just didn't have the instinct\" for campaigning, as the paper reports on what it calls \"the blame game\" over the Tories' election defeat. \nThe Daily Mail likens it more to a civil war, as one former cabinet minister tells the paper the Conservatives \"were left vulnerable by a Boris-shaped hole in their defences, through which Reform was able to stroll unchallenged\". In his column in the paper, Boris Johnson sets out a 10-point plan on how the Tories can return to government as soon as possible, after what he calls \"the atomic bomb that has detonated over the British political landscape\".\nBut the Tories will need to find a new leader first and according to the Daily Mirror the former home secretary, Suella Braverman, has already fired the starting pistol in a leadership race. \nThe Guardian names the former business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, as another \"near-certain contender\". It claims her run \"would most likely be characterised by her apparent ability to turn the most innocuous exchange into an argument\". \nThe Times adds James Cleverly, Dame Priti Patel, Victoria Atkins and Tom Tugendhat to the list of Tories said to be weighing up a leadership run, while the Sun says the former immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, could launch his bid on the Sunday morning political shows. \nBut, whoever is running, one moderate Tory warns the Financial Times that \"the leadership contest will be dominated by one question: how do you beat Reform?\".\nReflecting on what it calls the SNP's \"hammering at the polls\", the Scotsman says John Swinney has been \"forced into rethinking\" his party's approach to independence. The paper says he will have to \"steer the Scottish National Party in a new direction, with a much-reduced crew\". \nThe National claims the result presents \"an opportunity for a new start\". It recommends the SNP refreshes the arguments for a new generation of independence voters.\nAnd, the front page of the Daily Express praises Rishi Sunak for displaying \"warmth, generosity of spirit and true graciousness\" as he stepped down, while also acknowledging that his successor is \"undoubtedly decent and sincere\".\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Long-range US missiles are to be deployed periodically in Germany from 2026 for the first time since the Cold War, in a decision announced at Nato's 75th anniversary summit.\nThe Tomahawk cruise, SM-6 and hypersonic missiles have a significantly longer range than existing missiles, the US and Germany said in a joint statement.\nSuch missiles would have been banned under a 1988 treaty between the US and former Soviet Union, but the pact fell apart five years ago.\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow would react with a \"military reponse to the new threat\".\n\"This is just a link in the chain of a course of escalation,\" he argued, accusing Nato and the US of trying to intimidate Russia.\nThe joint US-German statement made clear the \"episodic\" deployment of the missiles was initially seen as temporary but would later become permanent, as part of a US commitment to Nato and Europe's \"integrated deterrence\".\nGerman Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, who was speaking at the Nato summit in Washington, said the idea behind the US plan was to encourage Germany and other European countries to put their own investment into developing and procuring longer-range missiles.\nThe temporary deployment of US weapons would give Nato allies the time to prepare, he explained:  \"We are talking here about an increasingly serious gap in capability in Europe.\"\nMr Pistorius joined colleagues from France, Italy and Poland on Thursday in signing a letter of intent aimed at developing long-range missiles in Europe. The European Long-Range Strike Approach (Elsa) was intended to improve European missile capability, which was \"sorely needed to deter and defend our continent\", Italian news agency Ansa reported.\nSuch missiles were banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF), which was signed at the end of the Cold War and covered ground-launched missiles that could travel between 500-5,500 km (310-3,400 miles).\nRussia's Vladimir Putin felt it was too restrictive and in 2014 the US accused him of violating the pact with a new type of nuclear-capable cruise missile.\nThe US finally pulled out of the treaty in 2019, and Russia followed suit.\nPoliticians from Germany's Greens were critical of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's agreement to allow US missiles on German soil.\nThe Greens are part of Mr Scholz's ruling coalition, and their spokeswoman on security Sara Nanni made clear their frustration that he had made no comment about the decision.\n\"It can even heighten fears and leaves room for disinformation and incitement,\" she told the Rheinische Post newspaper.\n",

    "Facing an alarming rise in bear attacks, Japan wants to make it easier to shoot the animals in residential areas - but hunters say it is too risky. \nIn the year to April, there were a record 219 bear attacks in the country - six of them fatal, according to official data.\nDeadly attacks have continued to occur in recent months, as bears increasingly venture into populated areas. Some are now even thought to see humans as prey.\nBear numbers have revived as Japan's human population ages and shrinks, especially outside cities. The consequences have been dangerous, although usually resulting in injury not death.\nUnder the current law, licensed hunters can fire their guns only after the approval of a police officer.\nThe government plans to revise the law at its next parliamentary session so the weapons can be used more freely. For instance, hunters will be allowed to shoot if there is a risk of human injury, such as when a bear enters a building. \nBut hunters are wary. \"It is scary and quite dangerous to encounter a bear. It is never guaranteed that we can kill a bear by shooting,\" said Satoshi Saito, executive director of the Hokkaido Hunters' Association.\n\"If we miss the vital point to stop the bear from moving... it will run away and may attack other people,\" he added. \"If it then attacks a person, who will be responsible for that?\"\nHokkaido has come to exemplify Japan's growing bear problem. \nThe country's northernmost major island is sparsely populated - but its bear population has more than doubled since 1990, according to government data. It now has around 12,000 brown bears, which are known to be more aggressive than  black bears, of which there are around 10,000 in Japan by experts' estimates.\nLocal governments have tried different strategies to keep bears away. \nSome have turned to odd guardians - robot wolves, complete with red eyes and spooky howls, while elsewhere in the country they are testing an artificial intelligence warning system.\nThe town of Naie in Hokkaido has been trying to hire hunters for 10,300 yen ($64; \u00a350) a day to patrol the streets, lay traps and kill the animals if necessary.\nBut there are few takers - it's a high-risk job, the pay is not attractive enough and many of the hunters are elderly. \n\"It is not worth the trouble because confronting a bear will put our lives on the line,\" a 72-year-old hunter from the area told The Asahi Shimbun newspaper, likening an encounter with a brown bear to \"fighting a US military commando\". \nIn May, two police officers in northern Akita prefecture were seriously injured by a bear while trying to retrieve a body from the woods after a suspected fatal bear attack.\n\"The bears know humans are present and attack people for their food, or recognise people themselves as food,\" local government official Mami Kondo said.\n\"There is a high risk that the same bear will cause a series of incidents.\"\nAs bear numbers have grown, more of them have moved from the mountains into flatlands closer to human populations. Over time, they have become used to the sights and sounds of humans, and less afraid of them. \nThere are also fewer humans around as young people move to big cities, leaving whole towns nearly empty. When bears do encounter humans, it can turn violent.  \n\"Bears that enter urban areas tend to panic, increasing the risk of injury or death to people,\" said Junpei Tanaka from the Picchio Wildlife Research Center in Japan.\nBear sightings and incidents usually happen around April when they awake from hibernation in search of food, and then again in September and October when they eat to store fat for the winter months. \nBut their movements have become more unpredictable as yields of acorn - the biggest food source for bears - fall because of climate change.\n\"This amendment to the law is unavoidable, but it is only a stopgap measure in an emergency,\" Mr Tanaka said.\nCapturing and killing the animals is not the way forward, he adds. Rather, the government needs to protect the bears' habitat so they are not compelled to venture too far.  \n\"In the long-term, it is necessary to implement national policy to change the forest environment, to create forests with high biodiversity.\"\nHe added that the government also needs to clarify who should take responsibility for bears that wander into residential zones - local officials or hunters.\n\"Ideally, there should be fully trained shooters like government hunters who respond to emergencies, but at present there are no such jobs in Japan.\" \nResidential areas are a vastly different terrain for hunters, who are used to killing bears in unpopulated regions, Mr Saito said. \n\"If we don't shoot, people will criticise us and say 'Why didn't you shoot when you have a shotgun?' And if we shoot, I am sure people will be angry and say it might hit someone. \n\"I think it is unreasonable to ask hunters who are probably just ordinary salarymen to make such a decision.\"",
    "Stacey Ellis, a lifelong Democrat from Pennsylvania, should be the kind of voter that US President Joe Biden can count on.\nBut after four years of rising prices, her support has worn thin \u2013 and every time she shops at the supermarket, she is reminded how things have changed for the worse.\nMs Ellis works full-time as a nurse\u2019s assistant and has a second part-time job.\nBut she needs to economise. She has switched stores, cut out brand-name items like Dove soap and Stroehmann bread, and all but said goodbye to her favourite Chick-fil-A sandwich.\nStill, Ms Ellis has sometimes turned to risky payday loans (short-term borrowing with high interest rates) as she grapples with grocery prices that have surged 25% since Mr Biden entered office in January 2021.\n\"Prior to inflation,\" she says, \"I didn't have any debt, I didn't have any credit cards, never applied for like a payday loan or any of those things. But since inflation, I needed to do all those things....I\u2019ve had to downgrade my life completely.\"\nThe leap in grocery prices has outpaced the historic 20% rise in living costs that followed the pandemic, squeezing households around the country and fuelling widespread economic and political discontent.\n\"I\u2019m a Democrat,\" says Ms Ellis, who lives in the Philadelphia suburb of Norristown. \"I love voting for them. But Republicans are speaking volumes right now and Democrats are whispering.\"\n\u201cI want somebody to help me, help the American people,\" she adds. \u201cJoe Biden, where are you?\u201d\nFor the president, already contending with serious doubts about his age and fitness for another term, the cost-of-living issue presents a major challenge, threatening to dampen turnout among supporters in an election that could be decided, like the last two, by several tens of thousands of votes in a handful key states. \nAcross the country, Americans on average spent more than 11% of their incomes on food, including restaurant meals last year \u2013 a higher proportion than any time since 1991.\nThe jump in food prices has hit younger, lower-income and minority households -  key parts of the coalition that helped Mr Biden win the White House in 2020 - especially hard.\nBut worries about the issue are widespread: a Pew survey earlier this year found that 94% of Americans were at least somewhat concerned about rising food and consumer goods prices.\nThat was nearly identical to two years earlier, even though the staggering jumps in food prices that hit the US and other countries after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine have subsided.\nDylan Garcia, a 26-year-old security guard from Brooklyn, says he\u2019s never struggled to buy groceries as much as he has now.\nInstead of the fresh food and brand-name items he used to enjoy, he now stocks up on ramen noodles and frozen vegetables - and only eats twice a day because he can't afford more.\nAt checkout, he routinely uses \"buy now, pay later\u201d schemes, which allow him to pay the bill in installments, but have led to mounting debt.\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck in a loop,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s become an insecurity to pull up my phone at the register and have to use these programmes. When they see me, it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\nMr Garcia, who has long voted for Democrats, says his precarious financial situation has made him lose hope in politics and he does not plan to vote in November's election.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the government has our best interest and I don\u2019t think they care,\u201d he says.\nThe White House maintains Mr Biden has been engaged on issues of food affordability, fighting to increase food stamp benefits and other government aid, initiatives opposed by Republicans. \nAt last month's presidential debate, the first question was on inflation, and Mr Biden sought to shift blame to big companies, accusing them of price gouging \u2013 a claim that is hotly disputed among economists.\nBut despite strong job creation and low unemployment, opinion polls show voters continue to trust Mr Biden's opponent, former President Donald Trump, more on economic issues.\nOn the CNN debate stage, the Republican White House candidate blamed Mr Biden for stoking inflation, which the White House denies, and said: \u201cIt's killing people. They can't buy groceries anymore. They can\u2019t.\u201d\nThe Trump campaign in turn denies that policies he proposes - including a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the US - would worsen price rises, as many analysts predict. \n\"We believe that a second Trump term would have a negative impact on the US's economic standing in the world, and a destabilizing effect on the US's domestic economy,\" wrote 16 Nobel prize-winning economists in an open letter last month.\nRepublicans have accused Mr Biden of trying to mislead the public about the extent of the inflation problem, noting that Mr Biden has claimed, incorrectly, that inflation was already at 9% when he entered office. It was 1.4%.\nKatie Walsh, a makeup artist in Pennsylvania, voted for Trump in 2020 and says she plans to do so again, based on his economic record.\nThe 39-year-old says her family has ",
    "Twelve former Biden administration officials who resigned over policy on Israel and the Gaza war say the government\u2019s actions have endangered US national security.\nThe policies have further destabilised the region and \u201cput a target on America\u2019s back\u201d, they say in a joint statement.\nOne of the 12 resigned only on Tuesday from the US Department of the Interior.\nThe US Department of State has previously denied such claims, pointing to its criticism of civilian casualties in Gaza and its efforts to boost humanitarian aid.\nThe joint statement by the former officials says: \"America\u2019s diplomatic cover for, and continuous flow of arms to Israel has ensured our undeniable complicity in the killings and forced starvation of a besieged Palestinian population in Gaza.\"\nThis is not the first such statement from former officials but it comes alongside the latest resignation from the administration of Maryam Hassanein, a special assistant at the US Department of Interior. She also signed the statement.\nThe former officials accuse the US government of clinging to a \"failed policy\" that has not only been devastating for the Palestinian people but has endangered Israelis, stifled free speech and undermined US credibility over its commitment to a rules-based international order.\nThe joint statement says ongoing weapons transfers to Israel despite its actions in Gaza have further destabilised the Middle East and \"put a target on America\u2019s back\".\n\"Our nation\u2019s political and economic interests across the region have also been significantly harmed, while US credibility has been deeply undermined worldwide at a time we need it most, when the world is characterised by a new era of strategic competition,\" the statement says.\nAmong the other signatories is Josh Paul, who oversaw Congressional relations on weapons transfers. He quit in October.\nA former White House official, two former air force department personnel and a former army officer in the Defence Intelligence Agency also signed the statement.\nEarlier, seven current and former US officials told the BBC that President Biden's pressure on Israel after a deadly attack on aid workers did not go far enough and would fail to stem the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Hamas group which runs Gaza in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage.\nMore than 37,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nA state department spokesperson told the BBC the government agency was \"proud of the established channel that we have had - since the Vietnam War - that enables employees to articulate policy disagreements outside their chains of command and bring them directly to the attention of senior department principals without fear of retribution\".\n\"Of course, the president sets policy,\" the spokesperson added.  \n\"But as Secretary [Antony] Blinken has said on numerous occasions, publicly and internally, he welcomes people utilising the dissent channel and appreciates hearing alternative and different points of view.\"\nSince 7 October, the spokesperson added, the state department had held \"multiple listening sessions specifically designed to give policy feedback related to the conflict\".\nIn April, the state department said that the US had \"been clear at the highest levels publicly and privately with Israel that it must abide by international humanitarian law\".",
    "Tens of thousands of Palestinians are seeking shelter and a safe location, as the exodus from Gaza\u2019s second city of Khan Younis continues in response to Israeli military evacuation orders.\nThe UN estimates that 250,000 people in eastern parts of the city are affected by the orders issued on Monday, which suggest Israeli forces are set to re-enter.\nReports say an Israeli air strike on Tuesday killed 12 Palestinians in an Israeli-designated humanitarian area to which people have been told to flee.\nA major hospital in Khan Younis also now stands empty, after all its patients and medical personnel left.\nMuch of the city was destroyed in a long Israeli offensive earlier this year, but large numbers of Palestinians had moved there to escape another Israeli operation in nearby Rafah.\nExplosions, shelling and gunfire were also heard throughout Gaza City on Wednesday as Israeli forces continue to battle Hamas and other armed groups in the eastern Shejaiya district for a seventh day.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 37,950 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nSpeaking from Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, Louise Wateridge of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) told the BBC that its staff on the ground had been observing the \u201cvery chaotic\u201d movement of civilians from eastern Khan Younis.\n\u201c[It\u2019s] different from previous displacements, when we\u2019ve seen trucks and vehicles loaded up,\u201d she said. \n\"There are limited vehicles available, there\u2019s limited fuel, the roads are so dangerous, the situation is so unsafe. People are really at this stage carrying what they can in their hands and moving. It\u2019s devastating.\u201d\nMarwan, a father of four who has a pregnant wife, told the BBC that it had taken his family three hours to travel about 7km (4 miles) on a donkey-pulled cart from Khan Younis to al-Mawasi, which is inside a Israeli-designated \u201chumanitarian area\u201d that lacks basic services.\n\u201cWe left in a rush, so we couldn\u2019t get all of our luggage and important things,\u201d he said. \u201cI called a friend who resides in al-Mawasi. He told me there is a place next to me and you can come.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cFor the bathroom, I have to dig in the sand and the mud and make a big hole.\u201d\nOn Tuesday afternoon, nine members of an extended family who had fled Khan Younis were reportedly among 12 people killed in an Israeli air strike on a residential building in the central town of Deir al-Balah, which is also inside the \u201chumanitarian area\u201d.\nThe Associated Press cited hospital records as saying that Dr Hossam Hamdan, a 62-year-old dermatologist, his wife, their adult son and daughter were among the dead. Four of Dr Hamdan\u2019s grandchildren and the mother of two of them were also killed, along with two other residents of the building and a man who was on the street outside, it added.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was checking the reports.\nLate on Tuesday, the World Health Organization announced that the European Gaza hospital in eastern Khan Younis was completely empty, after its 320 patients and all of its medical staff left in response to an evacuation order for the surrounding area. \nMost of the patients had been referred to Nasser hospital, which was now at full capacity and had a shortage of medical supplies and drugs for surgery, it warned.\n\u201cEuropean Gaza Hospital - one of the largest referral hospitals in the south - must be protected and made operational immediately. Gaza cannot afford to lose more hospitals,\u201d wrote WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on X, formerly Twitter.\nAn Israeli defence agency said it did not order the European hospital\u2019s patients and staff to leave. But the head of the emergency department said the Hamas-run health ministry had said they should evacuate.\nA spokeswoman for the Israeli embassy in London, Orly Goldschmidt, said the evacuation orders were part of Israel\u2019s efforts to minimise civilian casualties and accused Hamas members of embedding themselves in residential areas.\n\"We know that they are also hiding in Khan Younis and we want the civilian population to be out of it, so that we won't harm the Palestinian population and only kill Hamas members,\u201d she told the BBC on Tuesday.\nThe IDF has not announced the start of an operation in eastern Khan Younis. But the evacuation orders are seen as a sign that it will be the next area to be re-entered by Israeli troops because they believe Hamas and allied fighters have regrouped there.\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) said on Monday that it had fired a barrage of about 20 rockets from Khan Younis towards border communities in southern Israel. It was the heaviest such attack from Gaza in months, but no casualties were reported.\nAnother 80,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza are estimated to have been af",
    "Motoring organisations have taken part in a five-day rally to test electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure on a circuit across the UK.\nFifty teams, including manufacturers, power firms and charging companies, drove EVs on a 1,500-mile (2,400km) course from Wolverhampton to Chester via Scotland and Wales.\nTwo delivery vans were the only entrants not to cross the finishing line.\nOther vehicles included a lorry capable of 300-mile (480km) journeys while fully laden and an electric motorcycle which was charged by plugging into a car.\nThe heavy goods vehicle, which goes into production later this year, could potentially collect a shipping container from Southampton or Felixstowe and deliver it to the Midlands or north west England on a single charge.\nJames Venables from Daimler Truck UK said: \u201cThe game-changing part of this truck is that it can charge during a driver\u2019s rest break. We can charge in about 30 minutes.\u201d\nHowever, the ultra-rapid charging facilities needed to accomplish that are not yet available. \nAt the opposite end of the scale, Sam Clarke from charging company Gridserve rode a Zero electric motorcycle for the entire route.\nWith a small battery that only charges slowly, using AC current instead of the DC current used on faster car chargers, he came up with a different strategy.\n\u201cWe are plugging the bike into a car,\u201d he explained. \u201cAt the end of each day I can slow-charge the bike overnight so it is full by the next morning.\n\u201cBy doing this exercise we can understand where the pinch points are and what the challenges will be and how we will mitigate them in the future.\u201d\nAlthough one in six new cars sold are now electric, the rate of change has been slower than the industry anticipated.\n\u201cIt is the biggest change in motoring for 50 years,\u201d said AA President Edmund King, who was taking part in the event.\n\u201cI can understand why people are hesitant. But actually you can drive these every day of the week over long distances without a problem.\u201d\nThe event from 1-5 July took in the Lake District, Scottish Borders, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, Norfolk, Oxford, Stonehenge and Exeter.\nMy daughter and I drove a 35-year-old classic sports car for five long days.\nIt had been converted to battery power by Everrati, a company at Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire.\nWe were part of Team National Grid, where all the vehicles were chosen because they were far from ideal for the task: the converted Porsche, a small off-road 4x4 not yet on the market, a delivery van and an electric bike.\nThat was exactly the point. This was a really serious test. If vehicles that were not remotely suitable for an endurance event could succeed using only public charging points, then the infrastructure is clearly keeping up with demand.\nEach of our vehicles had limited range and some only charged slowly. We had to stop more frequently than everyone else.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk or via WhatsApp on 0808 100 2240.",

A second deputy also opened fire, but did not hit the man, police said.\nJustice Sotomayor\u2019s home is not believed to have been a deliberately targeted.\nThe suspected carjacker, named in charging documents as Kentrell Flowers, 18, is being treated in hospital and faces carjacking and firearms charges. The two deputies have not been identified.\nCourt documents said Mr Flowers had emerged from a silver minivan - which had been stolen earlier in the evening - and approached the officers' car. \nCourt documents said the two officers were wearing US Marshals branded polo shirts and T-shirts during the incident. \nThe teenage suspect was charged with armed carjacking, carrying a pistol without a licence, and possession of a large capacity magazine.

    "An Atlanta judge has put rapper Young Thug's trial on racketeering charges on hold indefinitely after his lawyers asked the judge to recuse himself over misconduct allegations.\nThe lawyers said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville held an \"improper\" meeting on 10 June when he met privately with prosecutors and a key witness.\nDefence attorneys have alleged that Judge Glanville sought to pressure the witness into testifying and they pressed him to recuse himself, motions which the judge had denied.\nJudge Glanville announced from the bench on Monday that he would release the private meeting's transcript and send the recusal motions to another judge. \nJudge Glanville said the trial would remain in recess until another judge decides whether he should remain on the case. \nThe move is the latest delay in the trial for Atlanta rapper Jeffery Lamar Williams, whose case has only inched forward since his arrest in May 2022. \nJury selection for the trial - which has included testimony from dozens of witnesses - took nearly 10 months. \nProsecutors have accused the Atlanta rapper of co-founding a violent street gang in his hometown, hitting him with racketeering charges.\nGeorgia prosecutors used the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) Act - famously used in mafia prosecutions - to charge the rapper and 27 associates who were allegedly involved in the criminal enterprise.\nMr Williams, 32, is also charged with gang, drug and gun crimes and is standing trial with five of the others indicted with him.\nThe judge's announcement on Monday arrived after Young Thug's lead attorney, Brian Steel, was found in criminal contempt last month.\nMr Steel had questioned Judge Glanville about the meeting with prosecutors and the witness and refused to reveal who told him about it. \nJudge Glanville then ordered Mr Steel to serve 20 weekend days in jail, but the Georgia Supreme Court stayed the decision as Mr Steel appeals.\nProsecutors expressed concern about the effects of delaying the trial further on the jury.\n\u201cDo we have a timeline of when the motion to recuse might be heard?\u201d Simone Hylton, a deputy Fulton County district attorney and key prosecutor on the case, asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Judge Glanville replied. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d",

A large number of people were sheltering in the building, the BBC understands.\nThe air strike targeted two classrooms on the ground floor, they said.\nEhab Al-Ghussein was formerly deputy labour minister in the Hamas administration and before that an interior ministry spokesman. His death is not considered to be a blow to Hamas militarily, but he was considered a significant figure in the leadership of the Hamas administration.\nMany others in the Hamas administration have been killed in the past nine months.\nIn one Israeli airstrike last November, the deputy culture minister and the deputy speaker of the legislative council were killed, along with other government employees and officials, as well as senior police officers.\nSeparately the Israeli military issued another evacuation order for a central part of Gaza City.\nIbrahim Al-Barbari, 47, who lives with his wife, five children, mother and sister in the Bani Amer neighbourhood, told the BBC that dozens of families were leaving and women and children were carrying bags and heading west.\n\u201cWe heard from the neighbours that we had to leave the house.

Why is she so hard on herself?\n\"It's hard to be forgiven for that and it's hard to forgive yourself,\" she said.\nParenting author and broadcaster Sue Atkins characterises so-called \"mum guilt\" as \"feelings of self-doubt and anxiety about not being a perfect parent\" and said it was incredibly common.\nShe insisted there was \"no such thing\" as a perfect parent.\nShe said the pressure can come from society, relatives, a mother\u2019s own expectations and that social media could \"fuel the feelings of guilt and inadequacy\".\n\"It\u2019s not just mums that suffer with parent guilt, dads suffer from this too,\" she said.\n\"They want to be present, they want to be changing nappies, they want to be engaged with their kids, playing with them, talking to them, eating with them and of course, trying to provide and put food on the table in the cost of living crisis is challenging for dads as well.\"\nRhian said the death of her father when she was 12 was the catalyst for her \"going off the rails\".\n\"I call them the messy years of my life\u2026 I just did lots of things that I shouldn't have done and that set my life in a different direction,\" she said.\nShe said once her daughter was born she felt she was living two lives.\n\"I had one life where I had to be a mother, or some shoddy attempt at being a mother, and then another life where I went to college and went to university and still wanted to be that teenager who partied and had fun,\" she said.\nThrough it all her determination to be a writer never waned.\n\"It was the only plan I ever had in my life,\" she said.\nShe went to what was then called the University of Glamorgan to study for a degree in creative writing and wrote her first novel, Six Pounds Eight Ounces, when her daughter was three or four.\nThe novel about a schoolgirl growing up in the Welsh valleys was published in 2014 and she is working with Pendragon Works to adapt it into a TV series.\nHer second work, a series of poems, The Last Polar Bear on Earth, was published by in 2018.\nHer latest book \"girls etc\" is by far her most personal work - as well as her reflections on being a teen mum she writes about the drama of living with a teenager and explores issues including abuse in a same-sex relationships.\nIt came about because she  \"just found myself writing about the girls in my life - my daughter, ex-girlfriends,\" she said. \n\"It's just my process of working through things that have gone on, or difficult things in my life.\"\nShe said she had",
    "I am heading to the airport to report on the new prime minister\u2019s first foreign trip in the job.\nIt is now a familiar journey for me: to a private airport terminal, to clamber aboard the government plane with a union flag-painted tail fin and United Kingdom written down the side.\nWhat is it like travelling abroad with a prime minister? You can read my take on that here.\nLater on, Sir Keir Starmer will make this journey for the first time.\nAll us reporters sit at the back of the plane. Down at the other end, there is the prime minister, his advisers and assorted civil servants.\nThat bit doesn\u2019t change.\nIn just over two years of going on trips like this as BBC political editor, the thing that has changed is the prime minister I have travelled with.\nSir Keir is number four, after Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.\nTo put that into context, I was born in 1980 and I was 27 by the time I reached the fourth prime minister of my lifetime.\nAnd what a change all this is for Sir Keir.\nA week ago, I was interviewing him on the yellow plastic chairs of Hucknall Town FC in Nottinghamshire, the election campaign still in full swing.\nWell, politics comes at you fast when you are a winner. Today, he has an invite to the White House from President Biden.\nSir Keir is flying to Washington for the annual meeting of the Nato defence alliance.\nThere are some things as prime minister you can choose when to schedule.\nAnd there are some things, like international summits, which you can\u2019t.\nThe fog of campaign trail exhaustion probably not yet properly slept off (if this reporter\u2019s experience is anything to go by), how about crossing the Atlantic twice in 72 hours and a spot of jet lag on the side?\nSir Keir has met some of his fellow leaders whose countries are Nato members before, including President Emmanuel Macron of France and the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nBut he has never met President Biden before nor, for instance, the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\nThis summit means within his first week in the job he will have met the leaders of most of the UK\u2019s most important allies \u2013 vital, as other governments grapple with how the new UK government might operate and what its priorities might be.\nIt might also fast forward the sense of normality around a new government, that always takes a little while to take hold as people adjust to the fact there are different people in the most powerful political offices in the land.\nThere is nothing like photographs of Keir Starmer with President Biden and plenty of others to emphasise that point.\nFirst, though, a conversation with us lot, the travelling press pack, on the plane.\nIt is known as \u2018the huddle\u2019, when a prime minister comes to sit among the reporters, and we all get to ask him a question.\nWe journalists get together in advance to decide what questions we want to ask, who wants to ask which ones and in what order.\nThe huddle often goes on for half an hour or so, and amounts to a group interview.\nIt is, to use the jargon, on the record \u2013 so we can quote what the prime minister has said verbatim.\nBut given it is quite noisy, and often a little bumpy, at 30,000-odd feet up in the air, it is not filmed.\nI will bring you what the prime minister, on his first trip, had to say to us, later on.",
    "Plans to end the legal requirement for councils to publish notices of changes to tax in local newspapers have been dropped by the Welsh government.\nMinister Rebecca Evans said she recognised the \"strength of feeling\" over the issue.\nNewspapers had warned it could \"damage\" Welsh journalism and ran a joint front page campaign on Monday asking Welsh Labour to think again.\nIt is the second concession the government has made to the opposition over legislation in two weeks, and came after some Labour Senedd members had backed calls for public notices in local newspapers to continue.\nLast week the Welsh government promised its own ban on politicians lying after it faced losing a Senedd vote.\nCouncil tax updates are not the only notices councils are required to place in local newspapers.\nWelcoming the decision, Newsquest regional editor Gavin Thompson was concerned the move, had it gone ahead, could have been the thin end of the wedge.\n\"Once the precedent is set, once the first brick in the wall is taken away, we were concerned that the next time legislation comes up on planning, on traffic and so on, that they follow suit.\n\"If you take away statutory public notices from local newspapers, a good number of Welsh newspapers would not be profitable.\"\nNewsquest, which publishes the South Wales Argus and the Leader in Wrexham - had joined forces with Reach, which produces the Western Mail, WalesOnline and the South Wales Echo, among others.\nThe changes, which were included in the Welsh government's Local Government Finance (Wales) Bill, would have replaced the current obligation with a requirement to publish a notice on the local authority's website.\nIt would have required councils to \"put suitable alternative arrangements in place to ensure that such information is accessible to citizens who have difficulty accessing online facilities\".\nIn June Swansea East Labour MS Mike Hedges tabled a statement of opinion in the Senedd, which supported \"the provision of council public notices in local newspapers\". It was signed by 13 MSs, including four from Labour.\nOpposition parties were also concerned and the Conservatives had tabled an amendment, debated on Tuesday, to scrap the legislation from the bill.\nThe debate showed a difference of opinion among Labour MSs, although more spoke in support of the original plans than against.\nMr Hedges said: \"There's a lot of elderly people who rely on printed media in order to get information. There's also a problem of people putting things out on social media and other forms of media that are easily edited, easily changed to give entirely incorrect information.\"\nSome expressed concerns over the size of the print in the notices. Jenny Rathbone, Labour MS for Cardiff Central, said: \"A lot of these newspaper notices are actually unreadable to most people, because they're in a font that is so small that particularly elderly people, which are some of the most avid readers of local newspapers, are simply not going to be able to read them.\"\nLabour Llanelli MS and former minister Lee Waters said: \"I think it's important we don't confuse means and ends here. I think the ends we want to see is to support local journalism.\n\"Subsidising impenetrable advertisements is not the way to do that.\"\nBBC Wales was told earlier in the day that the Welsh government had attempt to add an amendment of its own, but it had been turned down by the presiding officer because it came too late.\nInstead Labour abstained on the Conservative amendment, which was passed with 24 votes for, two against and 23 abstentions.\nMost of the abstentions were from Labour - the two against were Alun Davies, Labour MS for Blaenau Gwent, and Lesley Griffiths, a government minister.\nConservative Monmouth MS Peter Fox suggested in the Senedd that it might have sought a \"transition period that would enable this to kick in over a five-year period\".\nHe thanked Rebecca Evans, finance secretary, \"for trying to introduce a late amendment to find a way forward on this. I really do thank her for her engagement with this. Unfortunately that wasn't to be\".\nPlaid Cymru's Peredur Owen Griffiths said it would have been a \"retrograde step, in terms of upholding the rights of the public to access information, especially those that are digitally excluded\".\nRebecca Evans told the Senedd she did not think it was \"reasonable to argue that the loss of revenue generated from one advert per financial year, which might bring in as little as \u00a3600, would make a newspaper unsustainable\". \n\"But I do agree with colleagues this afternoon who have talked about the importance of having that wider discussion about what's really a much more complex issue in terms of how we support local media and also how we communicate most effectively with residents.\"\nShe added: \"I do absolutely recognise the strength of feeling amongst colleagues on this particular issue, and I'm always keen to find areas of compromise, where we can, and to work with other parties.\"\nUnlike last week's d",
    "The owner of an animal shelter says she is concerned about new legislation that will ban the rehoming of XL bully dogs in Northern Ireland.\nFrom Friday, the first stage of new legal safeguards come into force.\nWhile it will remain legal to own an XL Bully dog, they must be muzzled and kept on a short lead in public places.\nKaren Matthews, from Almost Home Animal Centre, says her team work to \"rescue, not destroy\" animals.\n\"The last thing I want is to have a centre full of XL Bullies and having to make that choice [to destroy],\" she added. \nThe restrictions aimed at safeguarding people, livestock or any other animal from attacks by XL Bully dogs came into effect at midnight. \nSelling, gifting, exchanging or breeding from an XL Bully dog is banned and rescue centres will also no longer be able to accept an XL Bully dog.\nThe Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) Minister Andrew Muir said the restrictions are designed to protect the public and are proportionate.  \nHe said it was the \"best approach in this situation\" following the recent fatal attacks attributed to XL Bully type dogs, one in London and another in Limerick.\nThe total number of dog attacks investigated in Northern Ireland's 11 councils for April 2023 to March 2024 is 1,581, according to DAERA.\nXL Bully dogs are behind 48 of these attacks, with 30 of these resulting in injuries to persons or other animals.\nTitan is 14 months old, he was a stray transferred to Almost Home in Moira three weeks ago from a pound in Londonderry.\n\"He's one of the least stressful dogs to walk. He doesn't pull,\" said Ms Matthews.\nShe says she doesn't know if Titan is an XL Bully type, but that he may fall into that category.\nAn XL bully is the largest kind of American bully dog.\nThe breed is a variant of the wider American Bully, according to guidance from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\nTitan fits some of the criteria as set out by the UK government.  \nThey are described as large dogs \"with a muscular body and blocky head, suggesting great strength and power for [their] size\".\nOwnership of the XL bullies is subject to strict controls across the United Kingdom.\nUSPCA Chief Executive Nora Smith said one of the key criticisms of the legislation is that an XL Bully is \"not a defined breed\".  \n\"The only binary characteristics they have are the height restrictions,\" she said.\n\"The government has set out this broad criteria.\n\"It's up to each XL Bully owner to decide whether or not they meet these broad characteristics.\" \nDAERA said when restrictions were brought into England and Wales in 2023 there were 91 XL Bully dogs licenced in Northern Ireland.  \nSince then the number has continued to rise and now sits at 196.\nMs Smith said public safety was a concern for the animal charity but this new legislation \"just isn't the answer\".\nThe USPCA is part of the Dog Control Coalition, along with the Kennel club, the British veterinary Association and other welfare groups who are calling on the Northern Ireland Executive and other authorities across the UK to take a more \"nuanced approach to dog attacks\".\nMichael McCartney from Glen Craig Canine training in Lisburn has more than 40 years' experience working with dogs, including XL Bully types.\n\"A dog's a dog, it just depends who's on the other end of it,\" he said.\nMr McCartney added that he often had more bother with smaller breeds.\nThis new legislation is the first phase.  \nThe second will come into effect from 31 December 2024.  \nFrom this date, it will be an offence to own an XL Bully type dog without an Exemption Certificate or having applied for an Exemption Certificate.\nThis means if an XL Bully type dog owner wishes to keep their dog they must apply and pay for an Exemption Certificate by that date.\nThe penalties for breach of the new safeguards are up to six months imprisonment and/or a fine up to \u00a35,000.",
    "\"This undoubtedly surprises you more than it surprises us,\" Spain\u2019s manager Luis de la Fuente told his country\u2019s journalists.\nHis team had just beaten France in the European Championship semi-finals, setting up a showdown with England in Sunday\u2019s final.\nAnd surprise - of the pleasant kind - is perhaps the best word to describe what many Spanish fans have been feeling throughout this tournament.\nExpectation was low on Spain's sun-kissed streets as the Euros got underway, but that has quickly become national jubilation, helping to bring this much-divided country together.\nQuite a difference to the trials and tribulations of Three Lions supporters.\n\"At first my friends and myself thought that the players selected were a very personal choice of the coach and didn\u2019t represent the opinion of most Spaniards,\" said Jorge Gallego, a Spain fan in Madrid.\n\"We didn\u2019t expect to reach the final but throughout the tournament we started to realise that we could go far.\"\nWhile an estimated 11,500 Spanish fans have travelled to Berlin for the final, back home giant screens are being installed in parks, sports centres and squares on which to watch it.\nHere in Madrid, local authorities have said that, if Spain wins, victory celebrations will take place around the Plaza de Cibeles in the capital\u2019s centre.\nMeanwhile, the players are being lauded, among them defender Marc Cucurella, who has become a folk hero thanks to his big hair and an online song about him which has gone viral.\nThe lyrics feature paella and beer - it's a chant often heard in the stands of his league club, Chelsea.\nThe buoyant atmosphere surrounding the football contrasts with Spain\u2019s rancorous and often toxic politics, where the left-wing government and right-wing opposition seldom agree on anything.\nThe football team provides a rare rallying point. Parties and politicians have celebrated not just the results but the emergence of players, like Lamine Yamal, who turned 17 on Saturday and has turned out to be the star.\nThis team also represents Spain\u2019s multi-cultural reality. Yamal\u2019s father is Moroccan and his mother is from Equatorial Guinea, while Nico Williams\u2019s Ghanaian parents reached Spain after travelling across the Sahara Desert and scaling a fence that surrounds the enclave of Melilla.\nYamal has underlined his humble origins, holding his fingers up after scoring to show the postcode 304, the working-class, multi-cultural district of the Catalan town of Matar\u00f3 where he grew up.\nIt\u2019s a place that a member of the far-right Vox party, Manuel Gavira, once described as a \"multi-cultural dung heap\". \nBut the overwhelming sensation is that Spaniards are embracing their team, both for its performances and what it represents.\nEl Peri\u00f3dico newspaper said \"a young Spain, sassy and reinvigorated, has become the mirror for a country which has changed and is multi-racial and diverse\".\nEven King Felipe joined in the plaudits, saying that the men\u2019s team, radiated \"excitement, joy and security\", while praising the \"sparkle\" of Yamal.\nIt's easy to forget that Yamal's selection raised eyebrows and led to accusations that De la Fuente - a relatively junior coach who had never worked with a top-flight club - did not have the experience to succeed. \nOn the face of it, the team was a far cry from the star-studded side that conquered two European titles and the World Cup between 2008-2012.\nNow, there is a feeling that the national team has returned to the elite, restoring the self-esteem of Spanish fans in the process.\nResults are an obvious reason for the renewed belief. It has six wins out of six \u2013 a first for any team in the Euros \u2013 against opponents that included not just Didier Deschamps\u2019s France, but also hosts Germany and Euro 2020 champions Italy.\nThe style of those victories has also been crucial. Gone is the close-passing, possession-obsessed \"tiki-taka\" play which brought Spain so much success in the past. Instead, Spain is playing more directly, with two of its emerging stars, Williams and Yamal, wreaking havoc down the wings.\nThe result is a less controlled and more thrilling style than in the past.\nSpanish fans, who abhor dull football, have bought into it.\n\"Spain is going to win, without a doubt,\" said Luis Garc\u00eda, a Venezuelan migrant who supports Spain.\n\"They\u2019ve shown that they are the best team. It\u2019s amazing that the team has improved so much with this younger generation of players and that our hopes rest on these kids.\"",

    "A proposed Republican Party platform is expected to be approved at the party\u2019s national convention next week, but a much more detailed think-tank proposal has drawn attention for some of its suggestions.\nProject 2025 was created by the Heritage Foundation think-tank and runs for nearly 900 pages.\nLed by former Trump administration officials, it calls for the sacking of thousands of civil servants, expanding the power of the president, dismantling the Department of Education, sweeping tax cuts, a ban on pornography, halting sales of the abortion pill, and a whole lot more.\nThere is substantial agreement between many parts of the official Republican Party platform and Project 2025, although the think-tank document is much more detailed and in some policy areas and goes much farther than the party line.\nThere is a sharper contrast between the two when it comes to the issue of abortion, with Heritage urging much more aggressive anti-abortion policies.\nDemocrats have highlighted Project 2025's more controversial proposals, and called the document a blueprint for a second Trump term in office. However, Trump and his campaign have denied or downplayed its influence.\nIt is common for Washington think-tanks of all political stripes to propose policy wishlists for potential governments-in-waiting.\nThe conservative Heritage Foundation first produced policy plans for future Republican administrations in 1981, when Ronald Reagan was about to take office.\nIt has produced similar documents in connection with subsequent presidential elections, including in 2016, when Trump won the presidency.\nA year into his term, the think-tank boasted that the Trump White House had adopted nearly two-thirds of its proposals.  \nThe Project 2025 report was unveiled in April 2023, but liberal opposition to the document has ramped up now that Trump has extended his polling lead.\nRecent US Supreme Court decisions that have strengthened presidential immunity and curtailed the power of federal agencies have further worried Democrats about what Trump might achieve if he returned to the White House.\nWith Mr Biden's age increasingly a key election topic, the party has aimed to refocus their supporters' attention in an effort to mobilise voters against Project 2025 - which Mr Biden recently said would \"destroy America\".\nIn response, Trump has disavowed the document.\n\"I know nothing about Project 2025,\" Trump posted on his social media website, Truth Social. \"I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they\u2019re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.\"\nBut the team that created the project is chock full of former Trump advisers, including director Paul Dans, who was chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management while Trump was president.\nRussell Vought, another former Trump administration official, wrote a key chapter in the document and also serves as the Republican National Committee\u2019s 2024 platform policy director.\nMore than 100 conservative organisations contributed to the document, Heritage says, including many that would be hugely influential in Washington if Republicans take back the White House.\nIn early July, Heritage president Kevin Roberts further stoked the ire around Project 25 by raising the prospect of political violence during a podcast interview.\n\"We are in the process of the second American revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,\" Mr Roberts told the War Room podcast, founded by Trump adviser Steve Bannon.\nIn response, the Biden campaign accused Trump and his allies of \"dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America\".\nThe Project 2025 document sets out four main policy aims: restore the family as the centrepiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation's sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.\nHere's an outline of several of its key proposals.\nProject 2025 proposes that the entire federal bureaucracy, including independent agencies such as the Department of Justice, be placed under direct presidential control - a controversial idea known as \"unitary executive theory\".\nIn practice, that would streamline decision-making, allowing the president to directly implement policies in a number of areas.\nThe proposals also call for eliminating job protections for thousands of government employees, who could then be replaced by political appointees.\nThe document labels the FBI a \"bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization\". It calls for drastic overhauls of this and several other federal agencies, as well as the complete elimination of the Department of Education.\nThe Republican Party platform includes a proposal to \"declassify government records, root out wrongdoers, and fire corrupt employees\", pledges to slash regulation and government spending, and also suggests eliminating the Department of Education. But it stops short of proposing a sw"
